as you can see from tile today's video
today's video is going to be a one brand
tutorial featuring all Tarte I have not
done a Wonderbread tutorial in so
freakin long and I've been getting so
many requests to do them and just so
sorry that I haven't got around to do it
but I'm finally doing one right now and
this is going to be on the brand tarte
we're using I went to Hawaii with tarte
and we got so many new products and I
wanted to use as many in these products
as I could in today's video so that's
what I did and I hope you guys like this
video I love doing red tutorials they're
very challenging though like I'm not
gonna lie one brand tutorials are
challenge for me but it's cool because
it is it's a good challenge in a good
way and like a have to make this
work kind of way so this is the letter
came up with and I hope you guys like it
it's very springtime it's very like
we're about like burst it to spring any
moment and this is such a cool spring
look and like the lip I'm just not used
to this lip I'm sorry I keep looking at
the viewfinder and I'm like what
did I do
on me does it look weird I mean honestly
to be honest does pink look
weird on me or do I look like a Barbie
Bratz doll I want to look like a Barbie
Bratz doll I don't want to look weird
let a bitch know but yeah I'm gonna stop
rambling on you guys know the drill if
you guys don't like this video if you
guys don't like me please don't think
you've watch it just don't know what if
you guys do like this video you guys do
like me please like this video and
subscribe to my channel already and if
you're new what's up and Manny anyway
and welcome back to my channel or
welcome to my channel hi that's going
into this video
okay guys so it's going in started on
this one Rancher 12 completely barren
face dang I feel like I look like a damn
naked mole-rat with this face on right
now yeah I'm gonna go with the Tarte
clean slate
poreless primer this is just a nice
silicone II feeling primer grateful
people to have like more porous skin
hello me how'd I do when my name is mani
and I of course yeah problematic
starting on the center just kind of
blending outwards so for foundation I'm
gonna be going in with the new
rainforest of the sea foundation wait
art obviously this is a Tarte one brand
tutorial I got this recently when I was
in Hawaii whit's heart and they just
launched a huge array of products and
that the rain force of the sea
foundation was one of them this is such
a beautiful foundation I've worn it
twice so far the only thing about it I
don't really like is that I feel like I
have to use a lot of foundation to get
to the coverage as I want because this
is more of a I feel it's like a natural
to medium coverage foundation maybe
that's just me I'm in the shade
light/medium neutral and I'm going to
start pressing that in with the Beauty
Blender all over my skin it does give
you the most beautiful skin like
appearance of a foundation very glowy
and natural-looking which is beautiful I
love it even when I pile on a ton
of foundation it still looks really
beautiful really natural which I like I
just don't like to have to use like to
hold syringes of product to get like the
coverage I want you know but then again
I am a boy and I want to cover a lot see
that was one syringe and it only covered
up like this area of mine and now I need
one more syringe to do the forehead and
the nose maybe you guys don't have to
but I do if you're oily you want to go
with more of a mattifying product
underneath and set this with the powder
because it is going to be pretty glowy
as you can see it does give a beautiful
amount of coverage once you layer it on
looks super super pretty very glowy very
natural-looking overall this is a
beautiful ass foundation like it's truly
stunning I'm gonna go in with the Tarte
I was owned in clay waterproof 12-hour
concealer I really like this concealer
I've actually use this consider many
times before which is a really nice full
coverage stick concealer like you can
see freakin full s coverage it's
insanity I'm gonna use too much of it
because this is a very very heavy weight
and dense concealer it reminds me of
like the Kevyn Aucoin concealer like
it's that intense
full ass thick coverage concealer I'm
the shade Fairlight because I like to
highlight with them as well and I'm
going to put in areas I need more
coverage as well okay perfect and now
we're going to go in and blend that out
with the same beauty blender that we
just went in with for the face full ass
coverage concealer I really do like this
one a lot mmm see that thinking me okay
great so that's what you should have so
far just nice just blend it out
highlight it is concealer and
foundation on there's a lot of powder so
let me go with a smooth operator and
which is like their translucent powder
to set the face with I'm going to put
that underneath the eyes just to really
make sure that everything is set in
place underneath the eye because again
this is a very creamy concealer you want
to make sure that it is set or it will
begin to crease on you I can already see
some of it wanting to crease and I'm
like no bitch not today so just kind of
go in with a little bit of the smooth
operator just a very small amount
because this is a white translucent
powder and we don't want any crazy kind
of flashback you know what I mean you
know what I mean I know you do
you've seen those photos elusive
liberties when you're thinking damn
bitch poor you yeah and then I'm going
to take a huge brush this is the morphe
41 just a big fluffy brush any kind of
big fluffy brush will work I'm just
going to dip in a little bit what I have
on the cap of the powder and that's just
going to go everywhere all over my skin
just a very light layer just to make
sure that everything is set in place
this is a setting powder so I'll just
make sure everything is nicely sit so
now I'm gonna go in with the BB powder
by Tarte this is and one of the newest
foundation powders that they just
launched it's a creamy powder foundation
and it's a light medium neutral that's
the shade that wound up going in with I
haven't tried this yet this is first
time this is look at AB for me if like
this might look a little tan it might be
low time so I go with that same big e 41
I'm gonna go from the outside of the
face and then go in from there so like
the darkest color gets deposited on like
the hollows of my face already
this doesn't let me color this Lee
bronzer it's fine we'll live top
ten in the world if you're a little more
tan than you or for those to be this
powder is pretty the hook now I'm going
to take that down the neck because I do
want to match my neck to my face so the
skin is looking pretty nice I'm not
gonna lie I feel like this video with
tar like this one red tutorial is also
like a first impressions video because I
haven't tried a lot of these products
like I've not tried a lot of these
things so bear with me so now I'm going
with the TARDIS
contour
just like the cute little round one this
might have use and I really do love it
I'm gonna take a e to brush by morphe to
bronze up the skin I'm gonna take this
really warm bronzy color suppose like
vanilla and chocolate so then whenever I
get to the bronzing part I want to talk
to you guys this like the bronzing part
is where I start to get a little like
stir crazy and I want to be like you
guys like what you guys doing today
cause your eyes we going like what's
going on you know what I mean I don't
know what it is about the bronzer that
makes me get stir crazy but it does it
truly does this is like literally the
point of like no return for me where I'm
like okay guys so what we doing okay
cool what leave me comment like I'm so
weird I don't know why I almost forgot
to bronze up my right cheek okay man
you'll just walk around with one
bronzer cheek or one cheek bronzer what
and then I'm gonna go in with the makeup
geek contouring brush and it take a
little bit of the darkest shade in the
contra kit and just do a little bit of
contouring not too much I just want to
go a little bit not to him not too easy
calm down why am I talking like this
what this brush like to go in first and
they do a nice layer down and then I'll
start buffing up so there's no harsh
lines between the bronzer and the
contour I mean no gonna be wrong a lot
of people do like the harsh line but I'm
just gonna kind of blend the two
together let them marinate I haven't
done a one-round tutorial in so long you
guys know it's been so long like
since I've done a one brand I think the
last one I did was make it forever
and that was like Ohio I go dude that
goes a while so I'm excited to be doing
this so many people have been asking me
to do one and it's finally here
there's a spot on the right side of my
face it's right here and it rejects all
pigment like whenever I'm bronzing on my
skin or contouring like it rejects it
like I have to go over it so many times
to try to even get the slightest color
payoff there it's the weirdest thing do
you guys have that like where there's
like a spot on your face on your skin
that literally rejects pigment and it
doesn't like want to take any color it's
the weirdest thing
it's so annoying is what it is
I'm like bro let me put contour
there come on and then going back in I'm
gonna take this shade right here it's at
the lightest shade that in a coverlet or
brush I don't know what brushes is it's
from Tarte and I'm going to kind of just
highlight underneath the contour just
slightly nothing to him to give me a
nice like straighter line contour cool
so now we have the contour down we are
good with the face of far
now let's go in with some blush I'm
gonna take the tar blush in Ecstatic
which is a cute little like baby when I
got this like in the holiday set I think
I don't know looks like this it's like
the cutest little color it's a very
pretty peachy apricot color and you guys
know apricot blushes are my taking
out on more fat you three it's a very
bright it's really pretty look how
pretty that is I look like a
goddess tart blushes are so freakin bomb
have you guys use those tart blushes are
some of the best blushes I've like ever
tried they last so well on the skin too
like oh my god guys ever tried them so
now I'm gonna go ahead and highlight the
face with this bad bitch right here this
is the new skin twinkle lighting palette
they're launching their first have any
palate like how exciting is that I love
it this one is like a really nice
shimmery white gold and then this one
over here on the far end is a really
pretty pinky champagne and in the middle
one is like more of a matte yellow and
that's more like for the under eye I
think I don't know I'm kind of confused
by that one it feels kind of weird yeah
I'm not the biggest fan of the middle
one but the other two on the side are
gorgeous like I'm actually obsessed I'm
going to take the more champagne color
up here and start going in with my
morphe M 5 10 favorite highlighting
brush ever so cute so good so
highlighting the skin with it let's see
how it looks
do you see this I know you can I make
sure the astronauts can yeah it's much
more pink on my skin and I thought I was
gonna be I thought something much more
like champagne but it's much more pink
so if you guys aren't really into like
the pinky highlighters watch out and be
weary for this shade on this side but
it's stunning it's still gorge
I'm trying to get more - pinky
highlighters I'm trying to dive into
that world a little bit but I think it
looks super pretty it's cool so we had
the face done that is it for the face I
want to keep it like this I think it
looks really freaking good so I'm gonna
go ahead and start with the eyes now
let's see in his eyes so I have no idea
that Tarte even did my primer or like
brow products like whatsoever I dug
through my room like hardcore look into
all my PR something I found some stuff
to use so I'm pretty stoked about it
like I hadn't I live was not expecting
that at all so I found this Tarte the
brow architect like pencil and it looks
like the new Anastasia brow definer like
I've had this for like a year
so I mean guitar - at first we
know but I'm not going to the shade deep
I've never tried this not even once I've
no idea how like this is gonna work
I'm just gonna run this through my brows
I don't feel like this puts a lot of
product down though this also might be
too light for my brows you guys
like to watch these videos because I
don't know what I'm doing with products
that I've never tried before huh guys
like this meet buck up if you guys have
tried any of the Tarte brow stuff let me
know in the comments bar below of what
you do like from them when it comes to
the brows because I haven't tried any
other brow stuff whatsoever I know they
have more brow products but it's the
only one I have personally so let me
know in the comments if you guys have
tried anything else that they might have
okay so I'm gonna keep it at this just a
nice furry brow how's it look to be
honest with me it's okay it just looks
really light cool that's going priming
the eyes now I have the Tarte clean
slate 360 creaseless primer I've never
tried this primer before it literally
first time ever first impression let's
see how it goes it comes out like a
little white kind of paste okay let's
try it oh oh why does this feel like
sunscreen so for the bodies we're gonna
go in with the tartlet in balloon pilot
just for like the easy natural part of
the eyes I'm not gonna do anything
intense with the shadow what I want to
do is a really cool different kind of a
liner instead so I'm gonna go very
natural on the eye so for things for
someone to grab a morphe p14
the shade charmer charmer is a very just
white beige color and that's gonna go on
the brow bone just to highlight the brow
bone a little bit so now what we're
gonna do for the eyes is we're going to
go in with a mixture of flour child and
smartypants a very light amount of those
guys on a twenty seven brush by morphe
not just going to go into the crease
because this look is solely focused on
the liner but I do want to keep the
crease a little more defined and whatnot
so I think these colors mixed will be
really really really pretty perfect so
now with a morphe m-43 three minutes
take a little bit of sweetheart
actually that which is like a nice dusty
rose ish color that's going to go on the
outer corner push that in to the crease
super nice just dusty rose ish color I
love the dusty rose like Oh dusty rose
anything obsessed and then I'm gonna go
in with a little bit of what color rebel
which is like a chocolaty Brown and that
just gonna go on the very very very
outer corner just a very small tiny
amount of it nothing too crazy and
taking that you 27 just blending that
into the crease a little bit as well
just keeping it very concentrated out
here in the outer corner though I'm not
taking you too far in and then going in
with that a fourteen one more time I'm
going to grab charmer again that the
color I put on the brow bone I'm gonna
put that on the lid light layer of that
all over the lid to really brighten and
awaken the eye so for the shadow part we
are done we're good on the shadows we're
gonna keep it at that so now for the fun
liner aspect today I'm going to be going
in with the new clay pot in mint I'm
gonna take that on a nice little tart
brush and I'm gonna go in with this nice
mint gel lining
and they're just gonna fill it in from
there it looks so pretty I love it I
think it's so cute like I'm obsessed so
I do look a little bit of black
underneath it to like make it look more
sharpened define on the outer corner I
just got the new so fine liner it's
literally like the skinniest do you even
see it like anything you can you can you
see how small this tip is look at my eye
compared to it there you go just like a
little bit of black underneath it to
make it look more sharpen to fine yeah
okay
doing it bucket the Glen yeah like it so
it's gonna put some mascara I'm gonna be
taking the lights camera lashes the
purple one from Tarte why do I keep
saying from Tarte I don't know what's
gonna apply a layer of that on my lashes
I'm gonna be wearing falsies anyway
taking the new bound some Serengeti
lashes I'm gonna be applying those bad
boys on the eyes today they're not too
thick of a band but they still give me a
nice definition which I love so we're
gonna do a bottom lash line now just a
little bit nothing to him am I taking a
36 brush and a little bit of smarty
pants on the outer corner my Laura life
sign just to give me a little bit of
definition on the lower lashes as well
so it's not just so like bearing down
there you know and then taking a morphe
43 brush great defining brush I'm
obsessed with a brush you guys know this
I'm gonna take rebel and put a little
bit of that on the outer corner taking
the lights camera lashes a nude liner
I'm gonna put that on a little lower
lash line I'm taking that same mascara
just a little tiny baby layer of it on
the lower lash line as well just give me
some more definition
oh god I'm just used to like a small
little one I'm like cuz we finally had
the eyes done yes thank goodness I'm
gonna go and zoom you guys in to see
what they look like up close
so I'm thinking that for this look
because I do have a nice blue liner I
really want to incorporate pink and the
lip because I do think that this look
would call for a nice just hot pink lip
and I haven't done a hot pink lip in a
very very long time I just feel like
Pink's on my lips just don't look that
good but I'm gonna I'm gonna venture out
and just say it life I'm gonna
take the TARDIS liner in the shade totes
and that's going to go all over my lip
goes with the lip liner on it's very hot
very pink oh my god I don't even I don't
do these colors guys this is a little
crazy for me I feel like a little I
don't know I'm gonna take the new like
matte lipsticks they look like this or
like in this little like really cool
tube I love the packaging in the shade
hey sailor bitch okay well this one's
broken okay
there's not a lot of product in here
either with the lipsticks that's as far
as it goes that's it I don't know I love
the way they feel time warna before and
I think they feel so good and the
formulas amazing I just don't eat
