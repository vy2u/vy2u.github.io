myself say I'd rather let me call hey
guys welcome back to my channel so as
you can see in the title of today's
video today is a one a brand tutorial on
all Urban Decay I forgot that I had so
much over Nikki a product the last one
brand I think it was Tarte I was like oh
let me know between these brands or
whatever brands it was and Urban Decay
wasn't an option and I was like yo I
actually have more Urban Decay to do a
full face that I have like of anything
so I decided to film this look for you
guys I hope you guys like it it's a
really just pretty chill look I have
some blue liner on some pink and gold
glitter on the inner corner I wanted to
make it still like really cute and fun
if you guys wanted to go out for
something like more festive and but keep
it still very much on the Cho side for
those of you who don't really want to
venture out as much and go into like the
full color intensity you know I'm saying
so I think this look turned out really
really pretty it's a very very pretty
for like spring and summer it's very
fresh it's very lightweight and I feel
like my skin's very glowy and bronzing
and just look so nice so that's kind of
what I was going for with this look
specifically as always if you guys want
this video if you guys don't like me
please don't watch it you know
the drill with that but I guys do like
this video and you guys do like me
please like this video and subscribe to
our channel if you want already and if
you knew what's up at mani MUA and
welcome to my channel and yeah let's go
and get into this one brand tutorial on
Urban Decay
let's get into this at one brand
tutorial with urban decay I'm so excited
to be doing this I haven't done one
brand in a while that's what I did with
Satar I believe first things first I'm
gonna take the Urban Decay v6 setting
spray but it's also like a priming spray
I'm gonna spray that all over the face
I've heard great things about this
setting spray I thought I had the D
slick primer I don't know where the
I put it no idea I know I have it
somewhere but I just I lost track of all
my I have no idea where I put it
so as for now we're gonna use this v6x
break cool for foundation I'm gonna be
going in with the Naked skin and
weightless in the shade 3.5 I'm actually
not the biggest thickest fan of this
foundation on my skin type tons of
people are obsessed with this foundation
and I know why it's absolutely beautiful
on the skin however because I have more
on the oily side it just doesn't seem to
really like me working my favor I don't
I don't know I'm taking on a morphine
for 3 night and start buffing that into
the skin give me a nice even coverage
this is a really beautiful foundation I
think it looks so so pretty however on
my skin it is such a lightweight like
watery consistency it gives a nice just
like medium coverage and this is
definitely a foundation for more people
that are combination normal or dry I
think perfect the base is on and I think
it looks pretty looks pretty good I
think the base is very beautiful so now
that arise I'm going to be mixing the
weightless concealer with the color
correcting fluid in the pink one so I'm
gonna take first the actual concealer
partner that's gonna go right underneath
my eye like right about yeah see that oh
my gosh so this is what it's like to
have more of a new one okay hold on I
have this dingy little bit here
yeah yeah my nose a little bit
highlighted to fail entering the color
corrector the pink one I'm super right
underneath here a little bit not too
much I just really just want kind of
brighten the whole thing on camera looks
 white watch how things go imma
good I'm gonna take a damp Beauty
Blender and just start to blend all that
out and blend into the foundation I'm so
beyond obsessed with this conceal you
guys this is one of the best concealers
I've ever tried ever and that's like
saying a lot because I've tried a lot of
concealers this could actually be the
best I've ever tried this one and like
the Mac Pro Longwear and
it ba-bye under I I believe it's called
Popeye under s awesome so now we have
all the highlight blended together I'm
gonna go and set it really quickly I'm
gonna set it with this medium light
powder by urban decay obviously there's
just like a face powder I'm gonna use
underneath my eyes to set what's going
on because there's a la neige morphe 48
I'm the type of person that if I don't
set my concealer it creases creases like
gnarly like not normal creasing like I'm
talking craters I'm talking craters so
just go and set it basically everyone I
put the concealer I'm going to set with
this powder as well and then for the
rest of the face I'm going to be taking
at this HD powder by Urban Decay this is
their naked medium light on a big powder
brush this is the e41 by morphe and i'm
trying to run that all over the rest of
the face I didn't put that lighter
complexion powder just so I can set
everything in place I definitely need to
set this face because it will move so
much
this foundation powder the HD powder by
Urban it's so nice it's the most
silkiest like lightweight beautiful
powder like ever Patrick oh tell me
about it a while back and then after
hear talking about as when I started
using it and I honestly haven't stopped
I bring it to like all my events with me
like I wear all the time it's so good
it's such a lightweight beautiful HD
powder like it says what it is and
because you like such a smooth like
application and appearance look at my
face come on smooth
now we're going bronze up the skin I'm
gonna take the urban decay beached
bronzer in the shade bronze this is like
their darker bronzer this color
basically I'm just trying to give a life
and dimension back to the face on a
morphe to gray just kind of have a brush
to bronze up the skin I like to
interchange between this one and the 5
to 7 I believe it's called I don't have
a contour color by urban so what we're
gonna do is we're just gonna make it
work with this I know I'm doing a 1 red
tutorial with urban decay I definitely
want to gear it towards like summer and
being bronzy and like just tan and
pretty you know what I mean so that's
kind of what I'm going forward with the
skin and this bronzer is so beautiful
ooh I'm looking like I'm having some
color come on Miami Sun give it to me
dig myself more of a cleaner appearance
cuz I just feel like it's kind of muddy
on the bottom here I like to have like
more of a clean contoured line I'm gonna
take that same b48 in that same powder
that we used earlier and you
have to kind of clean underneath the
bronzer to give more of a sharp
appearance just like this do that
already just makes it different like I
feel like I look sharper and more
defined
it's not like it's dramatic where I'm
like poking it or anything but it makes
a nice just subtle little difference
like nothing too crazy another word
bronze to fail I'm gonna be taking the
fetish blush on the morphe 3 this is
just like a really pretty Mabi blush
start brushing that onto the skin that's
like a pretty mouth color can you see
that pretty yeah thank you and then to
highlight the skin I'm gonna go ahead
and take eight hour powder blush in the
shade sin you guys this highlighter is
one of those popping ones I've heard
really good things about it actually
haven't tried to get it's my first time
trying it on a more feet you own morphe
310 let us see how this works
oh hey he's me in my headlight it's
definite I light for sure oh my god my
blush is afraid of this highlight right
now I think the blush is like oh not me
you know and let's go and move on to the
eye area okay great so for the brows
what I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be
taking the brow beater micro-fine brow
pencil by Urban Decay in the shade dark
I'm just gonna run that through the
brows oh I'd like to do with my brows
honestly I like to start from the bottom
of the brow feather backwards I like to
keep most of the product on the bottom
part of my brow rather than the top cuz
I like to have more of a clean line down
here like this we have a nice just
really defined brow line now and then
we're gonna fill it in naturally just
very very very lightly nothing too heavy
and now once I have the desired
thickness of the brow I'm gonna be
taking brow tamer which is like a little
basically tinted brow gel and run that
through the brow
it's a tamer it's a brown tamer tame the
brows digging this bro tamer though
don't the brows I primed the eyes
already I just took the Urban Decay
concealer the nigga way this one on my
eyes I should use the freaking the
actual eye primer from Urban Decay it's
so good the primer potion Karen I'm
gonna be taking a lot of this single
shadows by urban decay which are
absolutely amazing they have beautiful
shadows that single shadows I really do
think they're very very pigmented very
very nice I'm going to combine riff and
ABC gum which is like this vanilla shade
and it's like orange a muted shade and
that's gonna be like our basically our
crease color admitted on that morphe 27
code man emu 8 for 10% off
Lu shameless plug at morphe brushes calm
and in-store I love that brand I love
that brand so much I'm taking actually
little bit more of the riff shade which
is that like burnt orange II muted color
oh mama I had to be kind of bronzy
because my face I feel like is more on
the bronzy glowy side I want the same
thing for my eyes I want like the whole
look to be very very cohesive now I have
this nice really just muted orange e
shade down now I'm gonna take this
single shadow in buck which is like more
of a dark cool toned Brown and that's
gonna go on the most outer corner just
to give me some more definition and
dimension on AM or PM 4 3 3 a very
pretty cool toned Brown I bet people use
this for their brows I can see someone
using this on their brows for sure blend
it out with the same e 20 7 with no
additional product just to make sure
it's a nice blend so now what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna take the shade X which
is a really cool golden peach duochrome
shade absolutely stunning are you joking
me this is like everything and then I'm
going to mix it with this shadow called
cosmic which is like a very glittery
white shade I just feel like mixing
these two combined will give me a really
cool intense like glowy look and I'm
just gonna go for it taking it on my
finger first I'm taking X on my finger
first and just going to town my
an mmm
pinchy way look over and once I had the
shadow X down which looks absolutely
stunning you can keep it at this you can
keep this 100% but mm-hmm
you know extra I don't think the shade
cosmic and I'm going to add that right
on top of it to give me more of a
glittery shimmering effect which I just
want to go forward today
oh okay hi dimension how are you oh I
love this look I look it's so pretty and
just so like little like a I'm a
princess I'm a little princess ah that's
just so pretty and dainty I love it I
 love me going back in with that
rift shadow I'm going to take it on a 36
I run that underneath my lower lash line
to start to really mesh together the top
on the bottom of the lash line I just
want to make sure everything is very
cohesive taking it about like two thirds
of the way in because the eye is very
very more on the neutral side I want to
take a little bit of a pop of color and
I'm gonna grab the 24/7 glide on pencil
in the shade abyss which is like a
glittery blue shade I believe I'm gonna
run that in the waterline ooh my eyes
are watering today bitch gives me a
little pop of something a little pop of
color so I have a couple glitter options
I don't know if I want to do pink or I
want to do gold the gold is the one I
use on my cousin Soleil when I did that
inner corner thing I'm gonna do the
exact same thing just adding a little
bit inner corner pop but I feel like the
pink will go better with the blue
interim liner so I do pink haha okay
don't do it Urban Decay heavy metal
glitter in junk shell oh that sounds
disgusting but I live for it I was going
to play that on the inner third Oh
something very subtle very eleganza I'm
gonna add a little bit of the gold on
top of it why choose one one I have them
both I don't I don't know why I would do
that add a small amount of the gold a
little bit farther in okay great so you
have something like this just a nice
little pop of glitter on the inner
corners just to be cute and festive
we're gonna apply some mascara and then
we're gonna buy some lashes and call it
an eye and then taking the perversion
bigger blacker badder lash mascara I'm
gonna go and coat my lashes with that
you know the cool thing about this
mascara is it's a very very very
lightweight formula it doesn't feel
heavy at all I'm making a mess on my
lower lash line though amazing so we had
the lashes on now I'm wearing the lashes
the Vegas Nate grand glamour lashes by
I'll or I this is the first time I'm
actually trying them on and I think
they're absolutely beautiful Oh My heck

done with the eyes are done with the
face lip is all we have left to do I'm
gonna take the glint on lip pencil in
the shade naked you guys the Urban Decay
lip pencils they're stunning they're

but I am little and I promise you I know
it's really really light I'm gonna take
the naked to lipstick it's a very very
