called blood rosy by Beauty Blender I
have never heard this I think it's a
brand new product they have two little
into the Apache
this it's like a material used to block
your face when you're really really
really oily and you'd like Euler to but
has little mirror it comes with a mirror
you check this bitch out and you blot
your face instead of I having to use
powder you just literally you just to
take away the oil on your face and it's
so cool they come with a couple of
little pads inside this I don't know how
to use it I don't know what the to
do like ass bitch but you ain't no mama
gets already done today so I will be
using this and I will let you know what
I think about it I think it's such a
cool concept you can wash them and reuse
them so super stoked about that little
blotter Otzi blosser Adi Maserati what
blood rosin so next one I got stuff from
RC ma which is like that's what this
sense I never knew RC make good for a
sense for a Research Council of makeup
