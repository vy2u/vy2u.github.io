Alaura cosmetics to create this line of

Caribbean movies I love them so I'm like

me so I really wanted to buy some of the
products try them out on camera see if
they're worth the money or not because I
feel like I kind of have like a high
expectation please Little Rock has great
and beautiful products so I'm really
expecting some good things from these
products that I'm going to be reviewing

channel thank you so much for being here
I really appreciate it let's go and get
into this testing of this pirate makeup
argue or or can I have a patch on what
is that fucking shit okay guys so first
I have the base of my face on base it's
a sponsor huh so I'm me testing out the
cheek ballot ballot fuck
I would even aka dead men tell no tales
about it and this is what it looks like
right wait this is actually fucking
beautiful look at this this is stunning
this is what it looks like right here
you get your little palette and this
what the fucking moon oh you guys know I
love a fucking good boom this is the
cheap college very very cool I have like
cream bronzer on right now so it's kind
of what it looks like I have some color
to my face because I do some let's watch
this bad boy right here
so smooth a blush let's watch fortune
which is like a highlighter oh they're
so creamy
ahaha that's brightest fuck I'm still
gonna try to contour with that lost soul
shade it doesn't work then it doesn't
work I'm gonna try I'm taking on a y9 of
course favorites contouring brush it's a
matte shade I'm just gonna pray that it
gives me a little bit of a contour lo
some Sun okay contour shade is working a
little bit of product clearly goes a
very long way I barely dipped into it
and boom like massive massive pigment
where I'm like fucking trying to blend
that shit out but as a that's a go right
there guys a girl right here son this
color itself that was actually really
light like I was not expecting it to be
such a light shade looking at this
palette you guys I really would not
really suggest this for darker
complexions look it just doesn't look
like it would work sucks to say that but
I just really don't think you would
I'm just being honest and I'm frying I
might go I got a work that's big
underneath this shit real quick because
mommy's looking a little shit the
contour works for me
okay I'm light enough where it worked so
it's going with that middle blush and
going with Caribbean that middle guy huh
that was literally two little dabs oh
shit
from you that is pigmented and so smooth
that blends out like butter Paula Deen
would be fuckin rolling in green right
now for this shit okay I just watch the
three highlighters I just want to see
which I want to do at gold I think I
want to do that really intense color
right down golden color in the shade
star reader more free and 510 this one's
actually a really powdery flaky shade
it's a very very very powdery as you can
see it's like falling all over it the
highlight itself is pretty subtle
actually pigmented but it's pretty
fucking subtle take a little bit a
fortune on top yeah we got some Zahn for
taking fortune comes out of the nose
does she just looking brighter than my
future damn mommy how much is this let's
look let's look up how my connected
looks guys so this palette is $30 which
I feel is a very fair price for six
shades it's five bucks each that's
really really good as a prom than ready
to go so now I'm going to be taking the
palettes right here this is so cool
looking and it's like a little compass
treasure on the Stars I don't know with
this sorry there's like a little extra
thing here there's nothing in it maybe I
can hide things in it I don't know like
your virginity who knows but the palette
looks like this color scheme not my
thing let me do a little close-up shot
so I can see what it looks like we're
going to go in we're gonna go to suck in
I'm going to be taking this morphe m57
six amazing blending brush and then I'm
gonna take the shade a pirate's chest
which looks like a really pretty
apricot a transition shade looks like
this on the brush right there I'm gonna
take that into the crease yeah we did a
pigmented if ready blend it out so
easily - nice so I'm taking a little bit
of the shade Menace which is a really
dark like Foresti intense green on a
more feet m57
for which like a pencil brush any pencil
brush works great
this is just a nice pointed white haired
pencil brush I'm going to take that into
the crease on the outer corner of course
putting that into the crease as well a
little bit be very careful with these
kind of colors guys because they're kind
of a bitch to blend out
nothing to him because you don't want to
look too muddy so we're gonna take that
about halfway in and keep it really
concentrated on the outer corner right
out here this color from this palette is
not that used to blend out you can
definitely blend it out and get it there
guys to the point where you want it to
be just takes a little bit of patience
so now we're going to do is want to go
and cut out the crease a little bit take
whatever product want to use to kind of
cut out the crease I'm just gonna take a
little bit more of the Mac painterly
paint-pot because that's what I have as
my base and now oh my god they came with
a burst in it I'll take the brush I came
with I'm gonna take the brush it fuckin
came with so now I'm gonna take that
shade see haze and I'm gonna put that
and pack that right on top the Paint Pot
shuffle with the fallout that's really
real now go ahead and blend the two
together so they look too harsh yes
bitch fucking fucking snatched honey
okay I'm gonna finish the other camera
and I'll be right okay guys I'm back now
I went ahead and I put on lashes and
liner off of camera and this is what I
look like so far I'm wearing the lashes
by Kim Chi and cake face beauty these
are in the style lion-hearted they are
fucking sick these are drag these are a
drag fucking lash and I live for it now
we're going to go ahead and do the
bottom lash line but for someone take a
little bit of the shade shiver me like
shiver me timbers on a little more feet
Emma three to six and I'm gonna
highlight the inner corner the shade and
a little bit on the brow bone as well so
this palette also came with a mini black
eyeliner so therefore I just think I
have to use it and I'm going with that
in the waterline LBX creamy and then
taking a little ether t6 I'm gonna blend
out that black real quick and once we do
that I'll blend it out we're going to
take a little bit of the shade black
pearl which looks like a really cool
pearlescent bluish Brown reflect on that
same brush I'm going to blend out that
black with this one to kind of really
tie in the whole kind of greenish look
together well I was so real holy shit I
just thought that guy okay guys so I
finished my highlight this is what I
turned out to be and I actually really
fucking liked it I'm really done I look
like this I think it's really really
pretty it's like a smokey sea wench you
know so now I'm taking this product this
is a list
and lipgloss in one duo in the shade
risk it all that's the straight I bought
it's literally like a lipstick and lip
gloss in one that is not a lot of
lipstick in here that's just my personal
opinion I also grabbed the shade sparrow
just kind of diffuse it a little okay
combine and now I'm going take the
glossy side which is like a purple Brown
reflect which is looking really really
really cool so this is the final makeup
look you guys so let's go and see
whether or not each item is worth the
price or not hit or miss let's check it
out okay so first items into a quick
here miss done quickly the first item of
course is the cheek palette reading this
is a hit or a miss is it worth the $30 I
think this is actually a hit I really
enjoyed the powders I thought they were
super super creamy super smooth very
very nice I just seems that the color
range is not the most vast for sure I
just don't think it is but I do think
that the quality of the products is very
very nice and I would definitely
recommend it the cheek palette second
product is this bad oh my god how much
is this tell it honest it's fine now so
this palette is $52 and it comes with 18
shades so is this a hit or miss so I
think this is worth the 52 I do not
think this is worth of d2 only because
of the shade range I just don't think
it's that good I joined that such a
range is really basic and I would not
suggest buying this or $52 that's a
fucking fuck ton the shadows of course
do work and are definitely pretty under
pigmented and they blend nicely as you
can see but the shade range and the
price it's too too weird so I definitely
say that the palette itself is a Miss
for me and last but not least are the
little lippy lipstick and lip gloss duos
let's see how much those costs these are
the mod lip cream duo and these are $26
this one's actually really hard 26 26 26
isn't worth 26 I just feel like it's
fair because it's a lipstick and a lip
gloss and 26 is and not crazy for that
for them both and the formula of the
lipstick was really nice and it feels
really nice on the list is very
pigmented creamy I think that for $26
the low duo's are very much worth it I
think it's a very very very fair price
you get a lipstick and you get a glass
for 26 bucks I think that's really fair
and they're both a
fucking pigmented feels very smooth
glosses not sticky or goopy whatsoever
it just feels nice on the lips so what I
think about the glass duo's do I think
that they're worth it I do think they
are and they are definitely a hit for me
yeah and that is it you guys that this
my entire review on this pirate makeup
by lorac Empire to the Caribbean I do
think that this collection is really
cool and I there was definitely some
hits and there were some misses for me
it's your guy just call whatever you
guys want to do with your own money of
course it's your call I just wanted to
come on here and give you my personal
opinion and whether or not I thought it
was worth it or not so hope you guys
enjoyed this video as always have a
great for the night or day where you
guys are and I will catch you guys in my
next video bye you guys

Caribbean
