to do an Minka for it I mean why the
hell not okay so I you know I said I was
like that the house of lashes lashes are
kind of like hard to use and they're
like the band is really intense
once they mold to your eye I'm in love
with them these nor fairy bitches I'm in
love with them I keep using them all
that time okay well let's just get into
the unboxing because I'm really excited
