anyway now now we can get into it
officially let's get started on this
glass should we show our face turn oh
yeah fish I'm right here and this is
what we're gonna this is it we're
inspired by so Nicole side we're gonna
be inspired by this really cool face
chart she you created this nature yes
did you draw the history yeah well it
was a Mac one okay I mean I kind of went
over it yeah so we're going to use this
as our inspiration for a really fun like
pop art zombie there's been so many like
last year was like such a popular thing
and I thought he kind of funk so I never
really got to do it last year so yeah
I'll do it this year I haven't done one
of these in like five years
yeah their favorite thing to do they're
so fun because you get to shade and it's
like poppy but yeah cartoony and like
kind of my favorite thing in the world
we're going with the teal color scheme
yes I love it use the wolf brothers
paints these are water activated water
activated right it's literally like kids
face paints it's good for adults really
and it's not as it's like really come
you know genic like would clog all my
pores
no it's water-based so it just should
just wash right off it's not like
anything harsh it's gonna be like stuck
in there okay the first thing I'm gonna
do is take a gray mm-hmm and I'm gonna
use this
no kind of make my outline you guys
McCoy's literally the cream of like fun
things oh my god it's so late cuz I
don't want to do anything dark like if I
use a black right now yeah you'll be fun
no yeah cuz then they'll all start to
mix with the black it's a grey ZZ ZZ
whoa cool nose rather when you're doing
these kind of shapes you want to keep
them really organic looking so I'm not
gonna just make them perfect it's okay
if your brush kind of like wiggles and
wobbles cuz supposed to look like torn
flesh okay got it got it so that's it's
like it's like an easy it's like a more
easy yeah so it's not like when people
like I can't do that I'm like actually
probably good okay I'm gonna kind of cut
into your lip a little bit
oh it's so pretty that color ah morphe
s3 use cutting man anyway mmm-hmm oh my
gosh we're hey we're painting oh my
goodness and never did anything this is
so exciting
it's not yeah usually I mean like I
apply like foundation like it literally
is not ever an issue for me sometimes
these paints just they won't look as
vibrant
yeah but this color actually no matter
what it's good yeah so if I like where
this out for example like and I sweat it
would come up yeah this is not like the
type it's not like a rave makeup or like
yeah okay we got our base going
it's looking good looking snatched
looking like pussy yeah like that dead
whoo we're using that pink paint how
cute you want to like use your lightest
colors first yeah so doesn't like mix
and yeah
this is so fucking unique like I'm like
I'm dying already already already it
already see it good it's already coming
to light
it might be a good model you're being a
great model
ooh there's gonna be super pink closest
to the teeth but I'm leaving a little
space around the teeth for my black
outline because you always make a pox
yeah to me a pop so little pink and is
not to be perfect
and then I'm gonna feed this into a red
and that's not good yeah well I'm like
shocked that they're just these are just
paint brushes that I'm using from you
different Hobby Lobby okay cute it's a
mud brush just like a little pointy
blender this will help me to kind of
blend the two together yeah just like
you would eyeshadows these come together
do you want to try try what yeah yeah no
me too your tuna yeah and then just kind
of underneath okay making a little break
[Laughter]
on teeth with black
mmm that closure
let me take that little blending brush
I'm just buff out the black to you
before it dries so you want to do is
kind of fast before the block dries yeah
it's just one tooth yeah that's like a
bottom row yeah I think I you know I
shouldn't dig your brows no yeah there's
like sparse supernatural just a hint you
do live so fast like it's ridiculous for
the blood I just got really excited
mmm yeah oh my god so 10 tea
so now we're outlining who's knowing
I'll let you guys I waiting your bags
yeah damn I never had bags like this yes
I have if you like the corpse bride
right now and now are using black eye
shadow guys - what - shade shade it's
just a little bit more definition yep
okay so what I just did - was on the
inside of these little tears I just
shaded it a little bit over the teeth so
you can see it kind of looks like more
three-dimensional mm-hmm
looks good yeah like you what's that
wrong yeah see that on all of them so
the brains I mean it's just what's to
look like gooey little screen yeah so
it's like just little squiggles got it
and there's really no like rhyme or like
pattern here I'm just doing it sometimes
I'll make like a giant it sounds like an
S yeah yeah cuz mass is like but depends
they decided she wanted to join the
painting extravaganza well you are like
Nicole she loves the kisses okay guys
we're using red glitter now and do a red
glitter teardrop got it oh you know yeah
that makes sense
things are how it's getting there too
there so now we're gonna go ahead and
prime our eyes you guys were using Manic
Panic white paint now we're taking a
white base for the eye
like that look like that like moment
yeah
we have cardboard lashes guys they
literally cardboard this side is red and
this side is black living that is drag I
curled them a lot to what the paper the
paper is like you I wrapped around my
finger so they were kind of girl your
genius Oh how'd you go with a curler
okay so we got the lashes on and we are
on Anna popping the lashes look
sickening
they look drag they look diva so we
forgot to record this part but we got
carried away
but what we did is we took a little bit
of water and we're making little spots
on another skin for the little openings
yeah like little like lesion opening got
it will fill in no second do these
experimental iliyan right like a rotten
little nasty bitch no can you believe
how long this stuff takes face and body
painting like it's so nuts no in my
kitchen when I was like 18 my first
movie I was like doing makeup any day so
so worse okay last thing I'm gonna do is
just add like some random little dykes
markings just to make it more like
cartoony mm-hm
