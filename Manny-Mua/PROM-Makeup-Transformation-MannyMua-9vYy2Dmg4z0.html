hey guys and welcome back to my channel
today's video as you can see I have a
special person here this is my little
cousin her name is Soleil and she's 16
years old she was Jessica's kind of
creepy I should not say that nevermind
no I'm not telling you guys where she
goes to school and she's my cousin and I
love her so much and I decided I wanted
to have her on my channel and that's all
we have her on today's video we were
like I might house me now I said oh
grandma's birthday alright you know what
let's go and film a video because we
didn't feel like going out there and
watching the fight I mean we're going to
later but we just didn't feel like it at
the time I've never done makeup on
someone else like ever on my channel and
haven't done makeup on someone in
literally like a year since I worked at
Mac haven't done makeup on someone's is
this look so sick like let her snatch
face Oh
snatched so good yeah that's what we
decided to do in today's video I hope
you guys like it and enjoy if you guys
want to see how we got to this nice soft
prom glam because I saw a puppy in
college prom glam yeah like that keep on
watching as always if you guys don't
like just feel if you guys don't like me
please don't
effing watch it - it f word because over
here she's 16 that's combat health oh
yeah that's gonna get into this video
hey guys the first thing is first I'm
going to go ahead and Primus Ali's face
with the benefit Porefessional she says
she has more oily skin and I asked her
about it before camera so I'm gonna
prime with this primer great for poor
skin great for oily skins such a good
freakin primer I'm obsessed putting it
in the center of the face and kind of
going outwards from there and then I'm
taking the Smashbox primer water just to
kind of give her a spritz of freshness
throughout the entire face just to prime
the rest of the areas I didn't get with
the pore fessional and I'm gonna be
taking the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
foundation in the shade 140 and bouncing
it on with a clean Beauty Blender that I
ended up giving her after I love this
foundation so much it's medium to full
coverage great for prom great for any
kind of event because you are gonna be
giving that HD gorgeous look also taking
it down the neck of course and then
taking the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
concealer in the shade y21 I'm gonna put
that underneath her eyes to give her a
nice awake open look this is such an
amazing concealer it's very lightweight
it's very thin I'm just applying
directly from the applicator because I'd
end up just giving her the concealer
afterwards I had a couple extra colors
and I wanted to give her one and was
kind of highlighting the rest of her
face the Centers of the face of course
just kind of bringing more light and
awakeness to that area throwing a little
marijuana leaf on her forehead no big
and then I'm gonna go in with the B
butter just kind of beat that in to the
mug I just like to blend out concealer
with B blenders of course I love beauty
blenders and then you're really keeping
the lightness toward the center of the
face giving a lot of a weakness and
brightness to her look I think is
beautiful for prom just really
brightening everything up and then
taking the laura mercier setting powder
I'm gonna set the entire under eye area
all the way down to I put the concealer
basically everywhere that I put the
concealer I'm going to set it with Laura
Mercier translucent this is such a great
powder to set the face because it does
keep anything from creasing so well it's
just the best powder I've ever tried I
could not get enough of it it's the best
and then I go in which is a big powder
brush is the one from benefit that I am
obsessed with and I'm just gonna set the
entire face with other Mercier powder
just that very lightweight said because
she is more on the oily side and I want
to keep this makeup on as long as we
freakin can and then taking the Too
Faced milk chocolate Soleil bronzer I'm
gonna go ahead and start bronzing the
areas of her face I want a bronze like
the forehead the cheeks her chin just
the highest points of the face I'm gonna
start bronzing them up her name is
Soleil I just thought was really funny
that the bronzer is names chocolate
Soleil in her name Soleil
love it I love this color for her
she's a lot lighter and I wanted to give
her a nice warm complexion with this Too
Faced bronzer that I'm literally
obsessed with and this benefit brush
just really helps with the bronzing are
you kidding me taking a shot at Tilbury
number two powder and this just big Marc
Jacobs brush any brush will work I'm
going to set the face with this just to
kind of give her a nice airbrush finish
I love the charlotte tilbury powder it's
one of the best powders I've ever
experienced it's so good to set the
entire face just give you a nice light
weight air brush finish it really does
give you what you're asking for and then
taking the Kat Von D shade and light
palette I'm gonna go ahead and highlight
the areas of her face that need to be
highlighted like underneath the eyes the
forehead everywhere that I basically put
the concealer I'm highlighting again
just to emphasize the highlight more to
keep it on a lot longer throughout the
night because usually when you're doing
prom makeup you're doing it in the
daytime and I want it to stay on all
night now taking the japonesque blush
and OH - one my favorite blushes of all
time just to give her a very nice
lightweight flush of color
Becca moonstone you guys already know
morphe 510 brush gonna highlight her to
death prom this year 2016 prom everyone
will be highlighted - filth and that's
why I wanted to do a Becca highlighters
are obviously some of the best in the
entire game and I love this on her and
now for the nose contouring taking the
Kat Von D shade and light palette and
this little morphe brush I'm just gonna
contour the sides of her nose she
doesn't need it I just kind of wanted to
show a nose contour just in case you
guys did want to do it she's she's
diggin in she's into it and then
whenever I try to contour the right side
of a face I literally cannot do it
unless I'm standing behind them I don't
know why I just my hand doesn't want to
do it it's the weirdest thing
like I can annotate the laura mercier
translucent setting powder I'm going to
cook the sides of the nose where the
contour is on the sides this is gonna
kind of give me a more sharp appearance
of a nose contour and I love the way it
looks once it's done and brushed away
also cooking underneath her bronzer just
to give her a cleaner appearance because
I'm not really contouring her face at
all I just bronzed it up I just want to
give it a nice clean appearance and
afterwards we'll wipe it away it'll be a
nice sharp line now for the brows we're
gonna take the Anastacio dark brown brow
powder and this morphe brush and i'ma
start on the arch of her brow and just
kind of go backwards with it I love
Donna sessio brow powders they're so
good so pick and she already has such
great brows I just really just want to
fill them and not really build out a new
brow or anything because you have such
structured brows already I'm just gonna
fill him in where she has some
sparseness which was barely even there
at
I love them now taking back nw20 Pro
Longwear concealer I'm going to
underline the brow just to give it a
more sharp appearance I'm not gonna
really mess with them whatsoever on the
top just underneath the brow to give her
a more structured brow look and I think
this look is so so pretty and I'm really
into it just making sure you get all the
way underneath the brow sharp as you can
and then I'm taking the rest of that
nw20 concealer and I'm putting it on her
eyelid to prime for the showers we have
coming up next great concealer as primer
cancels out all the vain eNOS on the
eyes and I love it now dusting off the
rest of the powder just to make sure all
the brow powder that we were cooking
with is brushed off so now you can see
it's a lot more sharp and defined and
now for the fun part we're going in with
the eyes I'm taking a sigma e40 and my
makeup geek palette now we're gonna go
in with Sora and peaches and cream which
is such a beautiful color for the crease
love it it's a nice warm burnt orange
shade and I live for this color so much
now going in with frappe with the morphe
m43 3 and that's going to go more low on
the crease because I want it to be a
nice defined gradient crease and take it
all the way in to the inner corner of
the eye as well as blended out into that
Sora shade and then just taking a sigma
e40 again blending out those shades in
between steps now taking Aphrodite and
I'm gonna put on the outer corner of the
eye with this morphe brush and that's
gonna give me a nice defined outer
corner and I'm also keeping this a lot
lower than I did on the previous colors
just to make sure it's a nice gradient
like I was saying earlier it almost
looks like a kind of crease but it's not
I'm just really carving out the crease
of her eye just to give a lot of nice
definition and depth to this look
because it's gonna add so much dimension
to it
once I'm done blending it out now taking
the England 77 gel liner we're done with
the shadow part I'm gonna go and wing
out her eyeliner with the Sigma yo six
such a great eyeliner brush and I want
to make it a nice not not too intensive
a wing but I definitely wanted to be a
WOW factor with this look I want the
wing to definitely stand out I'm making
sure it's a very thin towards the inner
part of the eye and thickening as we are
getting towards the end of the eye and I
just think it looks so stunning so now
I'm going with Artemis I'm just going to
highlight the inner corners of the eye
and the brow bone area because I think
it looks so pretty oh just look because
it is all matte in the crease and on the
lid I want to keep it nice and glowy
taking in the e36 again and we're going
to do the exact same thing we did on the
top on the bottom lashline exact same
thing and then taking a
brush I'm mixing a frappe and Aphrodite
just give me a nice defined outer corner
same exact thing we did on the outer
corner of the top we're just doing on
the same on the bottom and blending out
of that as well just to make sure
there's no harsh lines and edges now the
fun part I'm taking the Urban Decay gold
glitter and really just emphasizing the
inner part of her eye I just thought
it'd be so fun it's prom you what you
want to do glitter for problem I think
I'm hidin I would have loved to but
now I'm taking the benefit roller lash
and putting a mascara on her lashes I'm
gonna put falsies anyway so I just want
to coat them they can look a lot more
dark and then taking the Tarte inner rim
nude liner and lining the inner rim of
the eye and putting mascara on it as
well taking a Bombay lashes buy a new
bound side I'm gonna put that on her
eyes I think they look so beautiful to
show wispy they're so intense and I
think it goes perfect with this look I'm
obsessed with these lashes and then
colepaugh Aquarius lipliner which is
made by Kathleen shout to Kathleen
you're freakin amazing lip liner and the
bite amuse-bouche lipstick in honeycomb
which you guys know is one of my
favorites ever I'm gonna do a little bit
of an over drop of not too intensely
because like she doesn't need it I'm
like the only one that's like a psycho
about over trying she doesn't need it
but I kind of want to do a little bit of
an over drop because I think it looks so
pretty and I'm so into that look and
then applying some of the by beauty
lipstick right on top of that lip liner
and then taking the Marc Jacobs sugar
soy gloss I'm gonna put that on her lips
I think it looks so freakin stunning I
love this lip gloss it's one my
favorites ever shout out to Jacqueline
Hill for introducing me to it I think
it's stunning
it's a beautiful nude color that's gonna
look good with any kind of nude lipstick
just to top it off in the formula is
amazing then that completes the entire
look I think it looks freaking
perfection come on girl slay give me
that pose mmm it's very glam but not too
glam where it's like holy crap it's
still like prom glam that's fun and that
