today's video is going to be a collab
video with my friend KP okay luster Lux
on YouTube I came up to LA to do this
nice prom type situation Club collab
that's not what I meant
oh my that's collab so we decided to do
a collab together I've already done a
couple of prom looks on my channel so
I'll leave a link down below
I did this with nice warm smoky eye with
so nice like pinky lip I want to call it
like a very street all grey shirt all a
very shrewd 'el smokey eye not only that
but that's what it's gonna be and then
she did a nice amazing blue cool toe
look so I feel like we just called met
each other I love cool tones I think I'm
one of the rare people who like like it
to enjoy it I love it I would
bathe my face in gray really yeah I got
it I'm like all about that warmth not be
something me so I'll go and leave her
link down below
obviously for her look I hope you guys
like the intro that was so fun doing the
intro was so freaking fun yeah if you
guys are like this kind of video don't
 watch single adrenal
yeah terrible that yes I saw it on your
if you don't like watching a guy do
makeup why the are you still
watching this video well I mean I do it
in every single video actually like mic
every single one but um subscribe if you
guys do subscribe to our channel
subscribe to Katie she's literally
flawless yeah okay back to the tutorial
tutorial hmm okay guys the tutorial and
yeah taught you soon talk to you soon
back to you stay tuned
how car like this bitch like move stop
that is so sick it's so different by
like cutting it up a little be changed a
little weak so I decided I'm gonna film
the look that I was wearing in my eye
menses video the one that I got kicked
out a ton of people requested me to do
that like brown smokey eye I only
brought these colors with me to LA it's
all I got I think I can recreate it with
this I know I have some colors in it
from there so let's go and try to do
that look so let's get this done so I'm
actually already primed kinda man like
that whoa this camera is so
clear this is not the camera is the one
I use the pro longwear concealer in nw20
by Mac and I said it with vanilla bean
shadow by makeup geek that's what I
always use as primer so I'm gonna go and
grab an e 40 my Sigma and I'm going to
take that into the crease with beaches
and cream which is like my notorious
crease color it's my favorite color ever
for the crease it's just a great neutral
shade it blends out everything super
well even if you're doing a cool tone I
using a warm tone tie you can blend out
 everything at the beaches and
from you can trust me so I'm going to go
and take burnt orange by honest Asura
Beverly Hills and that's going to go
into the crease to be our warm crease
transition color and I'm gonna take that
any Sigma e25 and I'm going to take that
into the crease and run it outwards like
I'm doing like a wing with it as you can
see and taking that all the way in
because this is my transition shade I'm
putting it slightly above the crease
because I have hooded lids kind of so I
like to really exaggerate my crease and
make you look like I have more grease
than I really do because there's not a
lot of crease there I'm just I am it's
not only the color down this is what it
looks like boom colors there
we need use that you 40 and blend it out
even more you guys know me you know I
like to do blending between every
 step I'm a blend everything L
kind of interests and now I'm gonna go
in with my morphe and 4-3 and red earth
shadow and that's we're gonna take that
a little bit lower than the crease I'll
get going on this red or shadows like
honest eyes above the hills and now
we're going to focus on the outer corner
and start blending in the red earth
color is actually to go all of our lid I
just like to cut that outline or where I
wanted to end
we've done the job and then go in with
ie 40 by Sigma again and blend
everything together you see now I'm
actually going with a Sigma wide shader
the e59 I'm going to go in with red
earth shadow by honest house yet and
that's going to go all over our lid this
is going to be our lid color we're going
to pack that on make sure you don't get
too much on the brush because it will
fall out on your face and you will
up your face and that's knocking on and
once we get up to the crease I'm
bringing it downwards like feathering
the red earth in my crease down into the
red earth on my lid in four three three
morphe blend out the crease with a lid
color I'm going to take a pencil brush
to e30 by Sigma and I'm going to take
beauty mark shadow back Anasazi Beverly
Hills
so I'm going to do is I'm going to run
that by the lash line and take that into
the crease a little bit too because it
is a very dark deep plum color I'm
scared this out of focus life focus on
me if the thing is a big up and
you can't like there's no focus on
anything it just adds it just adds
character I really thought that they
have character and it's fine I had a
really really really intense inner
corner highlight a lot of people were
like damn the inner corner highlight is
giving me life like actual life living
breathing life I don't sight in the
spotlight by makeup geek and my take on
a more feet and three to six and I put
that light in a corner and that's gonna
be the base oh my god this inner corner
highlight though I'm sure like that if
she's not used to having people like us
because I'm like a Custer see girls like
they don't cuss in their videos like
they're so good but I'm a disaster we
all know this so now I'm going take a
Rapunzel by makeup geek which is a new
shadow of theirs it is Rapunzel shadow I
make it meet that they just launched
it's like a champagne gold I am so
beyond obsessed I'll take that on top of
it in the spotlight I'll I can't screen
it's hard I want to look at ways a hole
so I'm gonna go ahead take the NYX
gel eyeliner pencil the Trey Jolie liner
pencil took a black liner gel liner
essentially option put that to the
waterline do it carefully please do
because I tend to be very messy but
doing makeup honestly I'm gonna go ahead
and take that same Sigma II 52 shader
I'm just going to blend that slightly
shading out that black with that brown
that I still have on this brush it's
really important to really work at that
smudging like don't just do a one-two
and be done like you really want it to
be blended don't take that smudging
lightly do it correctly
I'm so sorry of this videos like not
autofocusing and it's not that bomb
because I'm not used to a camera that
autofocus is so if I have something in
front my face apparently it focuses on
that and I'm like not happy about
it so I'm going to take a little bit of
red earth and I'm going to smudge that
out I'm gonna take a little bit of
beaches and cream and burnt orange
combined I run that underneath that
color just like we did with the top
basically we're just transitioning
everything out just like we do on the
top on the bottom top and bottom I love
to do the top and bottom it's go and put
a lash on because you know lashes make
that everything I'm gonna go ahead
and take number one lashes by blinking
Butte which you guys know hmmmm I was
about to play Alaska without even
curling my lashes or putting mascara on
the studio got me up this year I
was so far bub
I'm gonna go and take some mascara now
I'm gonna take the benefit roller lash
mascara you know this is my family now
oh yeah that's your eye on it and on the
bottom lashes too awesome so mascara is
on both top and bottom lashes obviously
you guys know I have a code for blinking
view if you save 10% on mg 10 they are
the best making linking lashes they're
the best mink lashes I've ever tried
from any brand and I really like velour
too but these ones are like my number
one perfect we have one pair of lashes
on and one eye completely done so we're
still go do the other eye off-camera
really quickly and I'll be right back
with the finishing face touches and
whatnot yes okay cool so we have both
eyes done completed so I'm going to be
you guys in so you can see what the look
looks like how is it this
let's go through some blush now let's go
and start with the face we're gonna go
ahead take Mac the warm soul which is
that oldie but goodie it's been on my
channel several times it's bomb I'm
gonna take that on a morphine g8 now I'm
gonna run yes
sighs have you been i play your assets
so good yeah I love warm soul so much oh
gosh I love this like ever coming where
I'm like oh that's why it's always in my
travel bag hmm that is why kids cuz it's
bomb ass if you guys want to know
how I did the bronzer in contour that I
did I have two other problem videos done
that's why I didn't I'm wearing a
full-face because I already had problem
videos done I'll leave a link down below
one of them I do do full face so you
shall see what I do you now I'm gonna go
and take the tls highlight this one I'm
actually gonna be using is Sunkist oh my
god if you guys thought that other one
was nice from TLS member I used TLS in
like a recent tutorials I could get
ready with me I was like living and
breathing for that I opened the
gold one and I almost lost it don't go
just take whatever I have on the cap and
I'm gonna use a morphe fan brush the
3:10 just very lightly loaded up because
if she is picking a rod mm I don't know
if let's write a brand that said to me
my peal box and I opened it and I almost
had a heart attack
see I should look at that highlight and
you guys know me you know um the
brighter the highlight I feel the closer
to Jesus that's just how I feel so for
the lips we're gonna do lips now and I'm
at the video I had I was wearing Mac
myth with um makeup server number 22
that was a lipstick I had I was a very
pale nude I don't have that with me
because I'm in LA I'm gonna try to
recreate it as much as I can take next
good neutral line the lips I'm gonna
fill a half of the lip in with this okay
so this is what it looks like with it
just line okay so I'm going to take
droid cosmetics Kim Chi doll I'm going
over the lip line it's really important
to go over the lip line so I blend in
with the actual lip liner that you used
it's not exactly the same as the one I
was wearing but it is a closest thing I
