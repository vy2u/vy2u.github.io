today's video is going to be the
tutorial on how to do this look I've had
this look this I look in a couple videos
already and I've been getting tons of
requests to film this look which is like
this deep purple smokey eye kind of
thing going on and I was like finally
I'm just like you know I need to sit
down finish in the previous videos I was
wearing a different lip but I decided to
pair with this very pale pink nude lip
this is like really late for me so I
don't know how I feel about it yet it's
very like who like you light as hell
it's cool to do different things
sometimes and this is so light but who
cares it like you know if you don't
like it so if I can watch it yeah if you
guys want to see how I could this look
with the eyes and the lip please
continue to watch I don't know so
there's this thing uh yeah and then that
I'll see you guys soon and yes it's cool
so we're gonna do first so we're gonna
start with Pro Longwear concealer by Mac
as our primer I already put it on my
lids we're nice and primed and I set it
with the translucent powder this is
grants a primer because it has
technology in it to not crease and it
kind of covers up all your let your
veins and just Chloe sure anything like
that so this is a great base for
eyeshadow I use it all the time like
always love meat okay cool so let's go
ahead do this purple smokey look because
you guys wanting so we're going to start
and we're gonna go in with of course the
Tarte in the palette you guys know this
is the appellant I used to create the
look that we created so let's go ahead
and do that smokey first would
things first what we're gonna do is
we're going with the e-40 by Sigma of
course you guys know that my favorite
thing in the world and we're gonna go in
with this shade and this shade and
that's one of our transition shades so
that means that we're gonna put those
down first and then the other clothes
going to be blending into that okay so
let's go in our crease I'm just gonna
make everything a lot easier to blend
out in the long run you don't need to be
nee just toss that bitch and so I'm
gonna grab a flat brush like any kind of
flat brush I'm gonna go in with the
lightest shade here we're just gonna put
onto our brow bone as our brow bone
highlight
yes brow bone mm-hmm now we're gonna go
in with a mixture of caregiver and best
friend which are these two right here on
the say me forty or together I just did
right into both
that's gonna go into our crease area a
little bit lower than our transitions so
now we have a nice little transition
color we have a lil bit of purple not to
cry sleep - not at all
no I'm Sam so now we're gonna grab my
more feet and 4-3-3 which is like my
favorite morphe brush of all time and
then we're gonna go ahead and just go
we're gonna just go in with this color
right here and that's gonna go into our
lower crease and just really blend it
into the crease nice and softly keeping
your eyes open for this so you can see
where you want the color to be deposited
we're gonna take it all the way in now
I'll go on with you 40 again and just
blend away any edges that I might not
like with no additional product at all
so now we're going with the funner part
we're gonna go in with bombshell which
is this dark purple color right here
that same morphe brush just get a good
amount on like that that's off the
excess and now we're gonna place into
our crease we're gonna put that in our
outer corner first and then we're gonna
put it into our crease and this it's
gonna be our outline for our smoky eye
so we're gonna put that into the crease
and outer corner right over that
previous color
then we go back in with ie 40 and blend
away the harsh like cuz you can see a
little harsh edge between my transition
and the purple we want that to be almost
completely diffused so now we're gonna
go in with a morphe 320 any flat brush
will work totally fine and then we're
going with that bombshell color again
right here load it in and now we're
gonna literally pack on the eyelid more
densely towards the lash line and then
we're getting up to that transition
color I'm going a little bit softer let
my touch is a little bit softer because
I want it to be more diffused the higher
we go so then we're going to go ahead
and grab that same morphe m43 3 and with
no additional product and blend the
edges where my lid color meets the
transition color it should look
something like this so I'm gonna go in
with a black eyeliner I'm going in with
the LA girl
I'm very black eyeliner and that we're
just focusing on the inner corner or
inner rim of our eye this big smoky
stock and then we're gonna go back in
with that deep dark plum color on a
sigma e 15 which is like those kind of
the flat sheet or brushes and that we're
gonna run by our lash line very close to
the lash line
so now we're gonna go back in to the
pallet we're gonna dip into let me get a
dip into mmm free spirit color right
here and the one right next to it and
now we're gonna blend underneath the
deep dark purple same brush we're gonna
go in with the lightest color and go
underneath that yes not so panda II like
the last one huh
like that so we have this nice dark deep
purple smokey and then just going to us
a little bit more of the light color
right here so really highlight it and
this is what the eye looks like I'm
gonna go and do the other eye off camera
real quick and I'll be right back okay
cool now that we have both eyes done
like shadow wise we haven't done like
the lashes or like that we're gonna
go and do lashes let's go and curl our
peeps right here we're doing falsies
anyway so it does really matter
imagine I sneezing like I'm like I chew
when I suck a rip off on all my lashes
cry that's not even funny I don't know
why I said that don't listen to me that
would be a terrible thing let's do a
quick coat of mascara bra well does we
have that one we're gonna go ahead and
put some lashes I'm not gonna do
blinking beauty in the style number two
which of course I've also talked about
in my panel before they give this nice
middle flared look and I also have a
code for blinking buttes I'll leave
everything linked down below of course
with code and links for I love this
pair so so much yes that just adds to it
and whole another level
let's go and finish this up with the
libs um I'm thinking you like last time
in my last videos I had pure Hollywood
on from Anasazi about the hills this
time I might put on milkshake that's one
thing I'm missing I'm thinking that take
the mood neutral NYX lip liner of course

Hauser dopey Hills and we're gonna put
that on some light ass color
