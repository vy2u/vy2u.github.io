today is going to be a tutorial on this
eye look I have going on right now it is
a really cool intense smoky eye with
purples so actually this videos a little
more special than usual um Marshall to
me the main star of the show for this
look is this eyeshadow called Kate
Monroe's and it's by making geek and
there's a little story behind the shadow
actually so this shadow was named after
a girl who passed away from batten
disease who was really close with
friends with Marlena daughter makeup
geek feels very close with her family
and the cool thing about the shadow is
that not only was it named after her but
100% proceeds go to the study of batten
disease which is a I think it's I
believe it's a neurological disease I'm
not really sure exactly it's a very
terrible ailment and there's no cure for
it so a hundred proceeds of this
eyeshadow box goes to batten disease
every shadowbot they are gonna donate 20
more dollars on top of the 100% proceeds
of this you're gonna donate twenty
dollars more to the study of batten
disease it just feels really great to be
able to kind of give back a little bit
you know I'm not buying these shadows
myself but I am using the shadow and I
really hope that some of us do buy it
it's a beautiful shadow I just think
it's so great when companies get
involved in that way and they use their
means to better the lives of others it
is so great it just really hit me hit me
hard like I was like wow I had the means
I would totally totally totally try do
something like this too and so because I
don't have them the financial means yeah
I'm gonna use my voice to be able to
talk to you guys about the shadow and
batten disease and awareness for others
you know it's great to be on YouTube and
it's great to have fun and it's great to
talk about shadows and brushes and
everything that I have but when you can
use your voice for something even bigger
than yourself it's so cool and it's so
just it feel it warms your heart so much
just on you guys know I'm not getting
paid to talk about this at all I just
really hit home I am an affiliate with
making keep but I'm pretty sure that if
you guys even if you guys were to click
my link buy this shadow I wouldn't get
any percentage of it at all which is
great that's how I find all the proceeds
should be going to batten disease
I just want to say thank you guys for
watching and I hope you guys like this
look and I hope you guys check out the
shadows
especially kitten rose and notice they
think you don't make a deep for even
doing that being able to do that it's
just so cool know how brands do that not
all brands give like that you know so I
want to say thank you to make geek for
making this world a better place and
really helping truly helping people so
yeah I hope you guys check out the
shadow I think it's great and I think
it's beautiful and I hope you guys like
this look and you guys don't like this
video if you guys don't like me until
 watch this video you guys know
the drill with that but you want to see
how I did this I look please continue to
watch this video and like it and
subscribe to my channel if you guys
aren't already but I think it's it it's
all I would say better than that don't
you guys later enjoy this video bye guys
cool so let's go and start this thing
I've decided that I'm not gonna do the
full face today I'm just gonna focus on
the eyes because that's kind of the
point in the whole video I'll be doing
like blush and highlighter and lips at
the end but the base of my face is done
my eyes already primed brows already
filled in so I'm gonna go ahead take the
morphe 27 which is a fluffy brush from
their new elite collection which is
limited edition get it now if you can do
it it's so good I'm gonna take beaches
and cream by makeup geek you guys know
this is my favorite transition shade of
all time from makeup geek it's just a
really great neutral color that I can
blend literally anything into it's just
such an easy color I love it you
and then we're gonna take unexpected if
I make a peak as well on the same brush
I run that right over the beaches and
cream and is just gonna give us more of
a cool purple lavender tone to blend out
into it's gonna work with this look I
can feel it in my bones don't use this
makeup geek shadows why are you so good
hmm there's really no girl over it now
I'm gonna go and take a clean m43 3 by
morphe which is basically the equivalent
of a Mac 217 I'm going to take sugar
pills poison plum which is a beautiful
deep dark purple but take that into the
crease that's gonna go into the crease
right up into that unexpected and
beaches and cream color it's such a
vibrant beautiful purple I love sugar
pill shadows they're one of my favorites
I used to use them all the time and so
I'm gonna run that into the crease
and I'm just gonna go and take that all
the way in because this the whole look
is a purple smokey I kinda think that we
got going on I'm doing my eyes open
doing this so I can see where the color
is gonna be put down you know what I
mean cuz I have kind of like a hooded
lid like fatness going on right here
with the skin of my honey
and it likes to fall over onto my lid so
I like to keep my eyes open when I'm
doing this part because I want to see
where the closed room you put down this
is why it's so important to have down
transition colors for me because as you
can see it's blending so much easier
than it would if I didn't have
transition shades down first you know
I'm trying to get you bit just to learn
here I need you guys to learn and now
I'm going to take a clean and 4-3-3 and
with no additional product I'm going to
blend out those edges into the
unexpected and beaches and cream it's
embarrassing how many m-43 threes I have
honestly I think I have seven seven like
who needs seven and four three threes
really now I'm gonna go take the morphe
gel liner in the color slate which is
like their black color have you just on
my channel a couple times already and
it's so good I love this liner it's
extremely black ok then I'm going to
take it on at 8:39 which is a super tiny
precision brush and I'm just gonna run
that by my lash line not neat whatsoever
because we're gonna actually blend this
out like that and I'm gonna take a very
dense blending brush like a small dense
blending brush that's not too big that's
very precise for me II fifty seven firm
shader and I'm just gonna blend out that
black with gel liners you have to work
kind of fast I'm just gonna do it kind
of really close to my lash line cuz
that's why I wanted to be the smokiest
so now as you can see it's kind of
blended out it's kind of diffused it's a
little really dark on my lash line and
kind of grades up that is what we are
going for for the main star of the show
we're gonna be taking Caitlin rose
shadow by makeup geek on a more Fiji 15
which is a flat shader brush I've talked
about this several times on my channel
don't forget you guys I have a code of
morphine mani MUA and all caps and you
get 10% off you get 10% off already
cheap brushes I know I know so load that
bad boy up and going start packing your
tool in having a black base down first
makes it look so bad as I'm obsessed
with doing this and I'm just putting it
right over that black and blending it
downwards and I'm not gonna be going
past the poison plum I'm not gonna be
going past that but I really wanted to
look kind of smoky and gradient so just
kind of start filling in everywhere that
doesn't have any shadow as you can see
the lash line is really deep in smokey
and then as I go up it's kind of gray da
ting and it's giving me more of a purple
reflect I'm gonna go take that same and
4-3-3 that I use to load up the poison
plum with and I'm going to go into my
crease and start kind of blending out
that Caitlin rose-colored with the
poison plum just so there's no hard
transitions and no hard lines you know
I'm taking that same 27 and blending out
those lines even more and this is what
the top of that I should look like okay
cool I'm gonna go first off camera quick
now be right back perfect at both eyes
done while he's the top of the eyes done
this sort of looks like I think it looks
super badass I am obsessed house on the
bull effect right now for like two hours
and I only have the top of the eyes done
and she was like I think you need to get
back to your tutorial and I'm like I
think you're ready I've decided wanna do
smoky on the bottom two I want this
whole look to be kind of smoky and like
badass so I'm going to take that same
detail brush that you 39 with that
morphe gel liner and slate I'm going to
run that on the bottom of my lashes and
then use whatever I have left on the
brush to covering it down a little bit
so we're going to take that same Sigma
brush that we used to blend out the top
on the bottom just very lightly take
that same sugarpill poison plum shadow
on my favorite pencil brush of all-time
the morphe b-36 get this I'm gonna put
that right on top of the black I'm just
kind of blend it out in little strokes
I'm gonna go ahead just take a plain
morphe m43 a clean one I'm going to take
unexpected from makeup geek again mixing
it with peaches and cream and run that
underneath poison clown just keep
blending that blower lashline so there's
no hard lines like this and then I'm
actually going to take that same morphe
g15 and Caitlin rose again I'm not I'm
just gonna go and toss that on the front
third of my eye very lightly I just want
a little bit of a sheen so that kind of
brings the top and the bottom together a
little bit more we need to a little bit
shiny shine up in this area Rahal g27
multi british little pencil beach and my
take shimma shimma by makeup geek
i'm ever load that on inner corner of my
eye cuz usually what i'm doing a really
intense smoky eye like this i like to
use a pretty shimmery color for the
inner corner just to open up my eyes a
little bit more than they are perfect to
the top in the bottom of the eyes are
done this is what they look like i have
mascara on already I put my Trident
Rouge for both top roller lash mascara
by benefit off yeah I can't stop and the
bottom extended play gigablack
mascara by mac cosmetics because it is
cooled so I'm gonna take the New Balance
some or newbie I'm gonna call newbies
the newbie lashes in the style dragon
Lee mink I know I can't I can't like I
I've been using the style Bella's like
I'm learning
when the total maybe like 8 times
already in two weeks eight times in two
I have a problem I'm like I love those
minks so much I am an affiliate with
them I do make a small Commission off
them but they give you guys 20% off when
use the code many anyway you get 20% off
all the site so like that is such a huge
amount of percent off because I've never
had a brand a lash brand offer my
following such a huge amount off 20% off
we are going to apply less loom we are
going to put them on the ice I kind of
wish I had a Russian accent sometimes is

be like so much and I like try to say

to zoom you guys in to see what the
final look looks like Oh close

Gucci they're good they're ready to go I
already have my face bronzed and kind of
contoured I'm gonna go and take Becca
blush in Flour child which is a very you
just kind of light rosy pink I don't
want to do any kind of like orange blush
or anything I thought usually like I
usually do warm blushes but since today
is a more cool tone I look I'm gonna do
a cool tone blues so I'm gonna go take
my morphe 3 my favorite morphe brush out
like and just kind of put that onto the
cheeks full of this blush is so
beautiful I'm going to put too much and
I love it too far in okay I'm gonna take
my foundation brush and press over as I
said before I'm a creature of habit so
I'm gonna go and take my drawer

morphe 310 Fame Brutus I'm just obsessed
with this Heather right now it's just so
