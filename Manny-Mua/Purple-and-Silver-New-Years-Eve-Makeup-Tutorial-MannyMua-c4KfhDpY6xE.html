other than that let's go and get into
this New Year's Eve glam look hey guys
okay let's go and start this tutorial
full face we're doing get ready with me
style as I always do because I feel it's
better you know you guys kind of get to
get ready with me as well so I think
it's kind of a fun aspect of it so let's
go start this bad boy with a primer I'm
already moisturize I'm gonna be taking
the Natasha to known a prime at magic
primer in the anti-shine one I literally
just got this like two days ago take a
little wallop hello wallaby start in the
t-zone it smells really good smells like
skin care can I suppose like SPF a
little bit actually it makes my skin
feel pretty sticky which could be the
glycerin in dahye no this is alizarin so
so sticky so we're okay mmm so for
foundation I'm gonna be mixing the
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
with the Born This Way by Too Faced
I just realized combination I cannot
wear the Too Faced by itself it
literally breaks up on me
like an ex-girlfriend like I just cannot
or an ex-boyfriend income game I just
cannot do it by itself like I have to
mix it with a mattifying foundation and
I really like the Maybelline one that
just mean I think I got way too
much holy tits and I just go ahead kind
of start placing that on the face I love
this combination I think it gives me
like a very full coverage but it gives
me a nice like luminous skin like
appearance you'll see Beauty blundering
it out how's everyone's Christmas
oh my god it's literally the day after
Christmas and I had such an amazing
Christmas it was social so fun I just
have such a great time spending it with
my family till I was very maa off social
media that's also another reason why I
liked it so much cuz I feel like I was
just very connected with my family I
don't that makes sense but I just felt
really really great to be close to my
family and connected with them and I
just really liked it it had a great time
how's your guys's so this is what the
foundation looks like
this combination is so freakin pretty
hopefully you guys can see it it looks
badass
I promise you over the cameras picking
it up like how it's supposed to be
picked up camera don't felonies so let's
go ahead and start concealing now I'm
gonna be taking the Make Up For Ever HD
concealer in y23 I have no idea when
this comes out guys I'm so sorry like I
feel like I've been using this like
constantly but I have no idea when it
comes out I no idea it didn't come with
like a little release date thing yet but
I'm sure it's gonna be coming out very
soon
I'm just gonna go and conceal with it I
really like it honestly I really really
like it it's lightweight but it's full
coverage so it's like super weird it's
hard to explain and I'm gonna mix it
with the shy beam by benefit you know
like that like high beam and Sun beam
and so like that
this is shy beam which is more like
pinky salmon tone and I just really like
because if I reminds me of the bright
nurse from Mac at kind of my name of
those and the packaging like are you
joking so adorable let me show
you guys up close packaging slay my life
and then just start blending it away
blends like a dream again dime
worthy the cup it's so bright I love
this combination uh so before moving on
I'm gonna go and step down right really
quickly I'm going to take my m4 3/8 by
morphe and does laura mercier secret
brightening powder and then just set the
under-eye really quick just so it
doesn't crease on us throughout the day
so for any so bright so luminous okay
now we're going set the face I'm going
to take the Urban Decay Naked Skin ultra
definition is powder huh
that is a mouthful the naked skip urban
decay ultra definition this finishing
powder say that seven times faster is
Matt amazing and I'm gonna taking more
feet 41 which is our newly collection
brushes die for this powder I'm gonna
start on the outer perimeters of my face
and kind of work it in because it is a
little bit darker so I kind of want to
keep it on the outer perimeters and then
lightly set the other parts of my face
you know I'm playing and then while I'm
powdered and ready to go I'm going to
take my Mac Studio Fix powder and c25
and not to go down my neck it is
hilarious that in my last tutorial you
guys notice I put liquid down my neck
cuz you guys know I don't like that I
just thought it was so funny
that so when you guys pointed it out
literally like people were saying like
it's the end of the worlds is it normal
is he okay like it was just a funniest
 thing I was dying wanted to say
like I love it that you guys noticed
that because that's so funny cuz you
guys know me so well it's crazy
well he's not even dude in the last
videos because my neck was really really
dry from the ultrasound from my at-risk
double chin put liquid down into making
that look so cracky but I just I was so
funny you guys know
and I love you guys for noticing it like
what the close those ones are brown
lamp the skin I feel like I'm very flat
face right now so it's go ahead and take
my morphe in five to seven love this
bronzing brush I think it's seriously
such a good bronzing brush I haven't
used any other one since then because it
has like that nice flat paddle
appearance I don't know just bottom and
I might take hoola by benefit of course
people probably like oh my god we know
you're gonna use that if Algar like
stomp so I'm just gonna start putting
that into the temples and you know just
putting in the bronzing places around
the hairline what was your guys's
favorite gifts that you guys got for
Christmas let me know in the comments
I'm just really curious wanna see like
my favorite part about Christmas is
giving gifts and I love like when other
people love their gifts you know what
I'm saying so I really love knowing
whether people got like this year was
the best year of like my whole entire
life as you guys know I always tell you
guys that you guys have made my life so
much more meaningful than what it was in
the past and so um I actually got to
give my family gifts this year and so
it's just really cool I never was at
financially stable enough to get them
like my skiffs or just any basically
anything I'd have to be really really
resourceful with my gift before and so
this is the first year actually every
gotta get them something that I loved
and that they loved you know and so it
was really really cool I didn't even
care what I got I didn't ask for
anything I don't want anything for
Christmas you know I just wanted my
family to be happy I wanted my family to
have gifts the first time ever like
because I never could afford that you
know and I hope you guys had an amazing
Christmas and if you guys don't so every
Christmas I'm sorry for going on a
tangent about it and I'm just aching
Cambodian light but yeah I wanna see it
was absolutely amazing I actually got an
iPhone 6s from my family I haven't told
my mom and my dad and my whole family
that I've been wanting my phone because
my like right mine right now I was like
breaking on me and um I needed a new
iPhone like desperately so I was like
 dude I need to get a new iPhone
like I was like desperate like I'm I was
like well I'm gonna go get an iPhone
right now I need it like this is like
two weeks ago I'll say I need that new
iPhone like mine's breaking and I'm
gonna freak out like I will freak if my
iPhone breaks like I'm the type of
person that will freak about that stuff
first world problems I know stupid
manual but whatever no I like freaked
out about it so she was like manual like
she's like don't go right now because I
feel like there have really really great
deals up to Christmas you should totally
go then so you can like save some money
and I was like you know
what I'm almost enough money
though sounds like okay okay I wait it
out that's fully fine so I was waiting
it out and even though my phone was
 breaking on me literally
breaking I was like mom I cannot do this
any new iPhone she was like it's fine
it's fine
so then my first gift I open it was from
my brothers Nick and Aaron from Nick and
Aaron to Manuel and I'm like oh cool
cool and so I opened it and it was a
 iPhone 6 and I was like what I'm
telling me to see him cuz I was I'm so
shocked I was like oh my god like you
guys are not to do that I woulda bought
my own I felt like I don't want them
like you know it is like when you I
don't know maybe this is just me but I
don't want like my family spending money
on me you know I was like you guys don't
I don't do that like let me like let me
take care of you guys you know like let
me let me do that for you guys don't
like don't spend money on me let me swim
in you you know I don't know I'm just so
weird like that's all I am I just don't
want them spending any money on me and I
was but I was so happy and so relieved I
was like thank you guys for that it was
just such a cool gesture they really
have to do better they did so I was like
you whores and nuts back there
sharpen the contour sorry I feel like
I'm not even talking like I'm just like
going on the super tangent mode right
now so sorry this is definitely neat to
check it right with me clearly and I'm
just taking a little bit of this shade
right here sharpening out my contour a
little bit I don't feel like cooking
today cannot find my highlighting brush
anywhere right now someone's gonna grab
that mustachioed anyone so I got a new
highlighter that I really really wanted
to highlight with today it's actually
nice shadow it's from Kat Von D it's the
thunderstruck metal crush eyeshadow I
just saw and i swatched it and i thought
it was so beautiful when I thought would
go prefered with this look nice watching
it take a white with pink and gold
reflect to it what haven't you tried to
come by my face yeah let's try it
oh oh okay
that is gorge that is gorgeous oh my
gosh these shadows are just so nice and
you guys know I love my gold you guys
 know I'm a gold bitch and I love
gold but I'm trying to adventure out and
be brave okay
oh so for the blast I'm gonna be taking
I just been using this blush all
month it's gonna be my favorites oh yeah
it's going to this is the japonesque
blush and OH - this is their velvet
blush I just think it's such a perfect
like blending blush color it's not like
to hit 10th it's not too crazy but it's
definitely gonna give you like a pop a
little some Sun let's just blend it on
it's beautiful and I love this
blush because I feel like it blends my
contour and highlight really really
nicely
it looks so basic in the pan it really
does it looks like a basic ass but
on the face it transforms it transforms
clearly my skin loves me because I just
had to break out last night cool okay
great so now that we have the face
completely done I'm gonna do the brows
and pry my eyes off camera really
quickly so we can start with the eyes
the fun part and so good yeah okay I'll
be Rebecca I did my own little custom
palette this is what I wanted to go off
of today when I think of New Year's eyes
I think of like silver and purple and
black and very very cool and intense and
clam so it's kind of what I was going
for with this little palette I did a
custom one let's go and start with this
eye look now I'm gonna take beaches and
cream of course favor transition very
very neutral transition which is what I
wanted on a 27 morphe brush not just
anything which is the crease again this
is a very neutral transition shade this
is going to kind of help with my
blending process going in with other
colors especially close like purple and
things like that not everyone's like
that it's all good but that is
definitely what I like to do you know so
next call we're going to go in with is
petal pusher which is a new makeup geek
shadow it is a berry just dusty
pinky petal color it's literally like
the perfect name petal pusher
so petal that's my bottom morphe and
four three three and that's just gonna
kind of go in to the crease literally
right over beaches and cream kind of
make it a little bit more cool toned a
little bit more pinky literally we're
just gonna layer that as you can see it
just blends out so effortlessly when you
have that big shadow down already first
you know I'm saying so now we're gonna
go in with the shade curfew by make it
big as well this is a much more
concentrated purple to connect plant
purple color and that's gonna go on the
same m43 and that's going to go pushed
into the crease lower then petal pusher
okay basically the same meth
that you're using for the bronze smokey
eye for the holiday tutorial I just did
recently is the same exact method we're
going to be doing with this
I eat 27 blended the pitches out trust
me if you're at a New Year's Eve party
and your eyes ain't blend in what the
 you going place at midnight don't
want to kiss it on blended eye that's
let's be honest so now that we have this
bad boy going on this is what it should
look like so far clear lid nice purpley
crease going taking a e36 pencil brush
and corrupt by making people just a
black matte shade you can use any black
matte shade doesn't matter honestly as I
said previously in my last tutorial guys
do not need to have the exact same
shades that I have I'm just giving you
guys color inspirations color palette
inspirations I'm using a purple crease
color and black in the outer corner just
things like that I just want you guys to
get an idea of a tutorial you guys don't
need to have these colors whatsoever um
but luckily you make a geek shadows are
only six bucks super nice taking a 36
pencil brush by morphe and correctly put
it on the outer corner we're gonna make
an outer corner V lower then we have the
curfew purple shade and then picking up
a little more curfew just kind of
blending out the black just to make sure
that everything is really blended in
defuse nicely now after blending away
some of the black with the purple this
is what you should have I have a nice
just dark outer black outer corner with
a nice purple crease so we're gonna
start with a fun stuff now I'm gonna be
taking a m42 one by morphe I'm gonna be
taking starry eyed by makeup geek so
this would be my base shadow like I did
from my other tutorial so I'm just gonna
pull my lid talked a little bit and
start packing on starry eyed so as you
can see it's a very very cool tone
silver pink as a base for aurora glitter
will be beautiful I'm also kind of using
sorry I have to kind of clean up the
edges as well this is what you should
have so far starry right on the lid you
can keep it up this if you don't want to
glare don't do glitter it's all good
this is such a beautiful look by itself
but mom was excessive so we're gonna be
using glitter so before I bust out the
glitter I'm gonna be taking makeup geek
Aurora sparkler glitter there's been a
lot of like speculation about these
glitters um about these sparklers so I
just kind of wanted to do a quick little
like summary of my thoughts about them
really really quickly because I know
people are asking what I think about
them so not all the sparklers are the
same consistency some of them are
pigment like glitter some of them are 3d
chunkier glitter somewhere like flaky
kinda glitters not all of them are the
same thing which i think is what's
confusing people they are all glitters
but not all
sissie is the same so that's a little
disclaimer real quick about the glitters
also they do not have sifters inside of
them because Marlena wanted to launch
them before during the holidays because
holidays is very like it's such a
glittery time as you guys know like
people like to wear glitters during the
holidays
she even said to if she's like maybe it
was a bad call on her part because of
not including sifters which is annoying
people because they are filled to the
brim and it's hard when you take them
out some of it spills so that's just
kind of like my thoughts on them
honestly the pigment like glitters those
are my favorite ones Aurora is a pigment
like glitter I don't like some of them
but I do like most of them so that's
just my opinions on it if you guys are
interested let me know and I'll give you
my thoughts on the glitters and which
ones are my favorites which ones are
once I think you guys need so uhm Aurora
is definitely one of the ones I think
you guys need I think it's stunning
you'll see right now because it's sick
also with them you guys do definitely
need a glitter glue base they're not
like a pigment they're definitely more
of a glitter they're finely milled some
of it will stitch your skin but you want
to use the glitter glue that's just my
opinion that's just like how I recommend
using it for example the two-faced
glitter glue amazing glitter glue that's
what I use so that's we're going to be
putting onto our lids right now I'm just
gonna pack it on with a same morphe
brush that m42 won over starry eye all
the way up now be careful opening these
because it I swear it will spill on you
so just be cautious with that kind of
annoying not gonna lie I'm annoyed by
the fact that they don't have sisters in
it but just one of those things you know
push out packing on the Aurora glitter
oh stop Aurora is a hybrid silver and
lavender glitter and I think it is
stunning so beautiful I'm gonna go and
finish the other eye off camera real
quick and I'll be right back okay great
so I went ahead and I did eyeliner
off-camera
I know it kind of looks quite different
coming back from like the last club to
this so what I ended up doing is I
grabbed the Kat Von D tattoo liner and I
just did a normal wing and honestly I
was kind of doing it and I was like you
know what I couldn't to make it little
bit more extreme so I added like the
little like front beak to it as well I
just grabbed the tip of it just sketched
out where I want to end drag it in
that's all I did it's really easy to do
do not even trip about it you do not
need to this time it's very excessive
you don't need to do it but I needed to
be really really close to the mirror to
do it so I had to do it off of camera so
I was like I'll get better I will
get better so now I'm going to grab a
morphe 43 which is a very very small
shader brush I'm gonna grab a mixture
of beaches and cream and the pedal
pusher and we're gonna start to create a
new little area on our inner part of our
eye and then grabbing curfew I'm going
to use the same brush i'm going to
tightline that close this to the
lashline ei teen blend that out on the
outer corner now grabbing corrupt and
the e43 again I'm going to place that on
the outermost corner and now taking the
two basic litter glue one more time and
that's going to go in between the B key
part of my eye and the new little lower
lashline area I'm going to put a little
bit there and pack on some more Aurora
glitter underneath the lash line I guess
we're going real glitter ham today so
you should have something like this it's
a nice little just pop of glitter down
there and then grabbing the tart in a
rim liner in the nude shade I'm gonna
put that on the waterline just kind of
open up the eye a little bit more and
you should have this as your I'm gonna
go to the other half of camera and I'll
be right perfect we have both eyes
completely done I went ahead and I put
on mascara and I put my lashes on off of
camera and the combination of choice
okay this is what I always use whenever
I say like I put on my mascara off of
camera what I'm talking about is I use
roller lash on the top mascara from
benefit and I use the extended play
gigablack lash from Mac on the bottom
mascara these are my favorite mascaras
combination so freaking bum I die for
them in the lashes I'm weighing our new
down some Serengeti they're like a three
silky kind of intense flavor you kind of
lash they're not like the Bellas the
Bellas and curl up words those are 3d
mink and they go up these kind of stick
out a little bit more farther so yeah I
love how this eye looks I think it's so
dramatic and so intense but I haven't
done this really dramatic intense
looking so long I hope you guys like it
let me go ahead and zoom you guys in to
see what the final height looks like up
close
perfectly now we have the face
completely done I'm gonna go and do the
lips now and we'll be done with this
look
yay so recently got into the mail and
kathleenlights knew where the night is
collection and I really wanted to use to
recolor because I love Kathleen and I
really just wanted to try these colors
out I'm gonna be using in the chit
Aquarius which is a very neutral and
nude shade you can do so many lip shades
with this look but because I am
definitely really dramatic on the eyes I
love doing dramatic eyes as you guys I'm
sure have noticed so I'm gonna do a more
subdued natural lip and that's what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna be using color pop
Aquarius let me present lippy stick by
Kathleen Lane's have you guys ever tried
the colour-pop lippie pencils because
they are so good
this lip pencil looks like my lip color
fault
that's weird because I let me
stick is a little bit more of a cream
Sheen finish and that's why I saw I'm
gonna go and fill in my entire lip with
the lip pencil like so home and then I
go in with aquarius cream little
lipstick lip a pencil so I mean this
lipstick is beautiful Kathleen holy
and this is what the final look looks
like and that's it that's it my entire
video I hope you guys enjoyed this video
