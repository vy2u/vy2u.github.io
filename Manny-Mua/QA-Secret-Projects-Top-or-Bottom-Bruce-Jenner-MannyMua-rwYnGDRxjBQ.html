so today's video is going to be aq and a
take vo is going to be a Q&amp;amp;A video I
haven't done a Q&amp;amp;A video in months and I
figured now's the time to do it cuz I
feel like I just hit 300k recently and I
want to do a Q&amp;amp;A video especially like
two answers I haven't ever answered in
the past before so I really want to jump
right in and do a Q&amp;amp;A video with you
guys cool let's just get this bitch
started because the feel like you and
A's always last so long and not everyone
wants to know everything about you so I
got you guys I got you guys back we have
the x1 second video don't fucking watch
it you guys don't let draw I don't want
to read you guys's hate comments I like
reading positive comments so if you're
not into this kind of video please don't
watch it just don't just don't
so I asked you guys to ask me questions
on Twitter and on Instagram so I'm just
gonna go ahead and go over the questions
right now I just screen capped a fucking
shit ton you can't see him but I did
okay so let's just dive in right now
first question what is your biggest pet
peeve um I have a lot of pet peeves to
be quite honest but I do have a very
long fuse so they don't really ever
bother me that much but my biggest pet
peeve one of the biggest is when people
ask me to do things I don't want to do
like in my mind I already have a
preconceived notion of I'm not going to
do something and someone I know asks me
to do that I'm just like I don't into it
that's like that's such a random pet
peeve
but sadly one my biggest pet peeves is
when people ask me to do things I don't
want to do it sounds so fucking dumb and
so League first world problems but
that's what it is I don't like being
asked to do things I don't want to do
plain and fucking simple C where do you
see yourself in five years
in terms of YouTube by the way hello V
one I love you too s villar oh five and
five years I plan on so be on YouTube
but I definitely not venture into other
themes but I want to create a brand if I
want to be on TV or movies or something
that I really don't know where I want to
go I definitely do more than you to
because I feel like I want a bigger
platform for myself and I want a bigger
platform for my followers and so I think
that for now YouTube is great in five
years I don't know where I'll be truly
have no idea but I'm hoping I have more
opportunities in five years from now so
wish me luck in five years hopefully you
guys will be with me still oh but five
years from now next why should ever feel
like you're judge because of your
sexuality is so what do you do to stay
positive how do you deal with people on
here who are hateful in any way for me
with the hate I literally just block out
all the hate I get I just literally die
listen to any of it of course
some comments here and there will like
hit a button and I'll like go off on a
bitch cuz I'm really good shakes I will
go off on a bitch I don't care but for
like literally like 99% of the hey I get
I do not pay attention to it because you
know what at end of the day I love
myself
and I love who I become and I love what
I'm doing so that's truly all that
matters as long as you are confident
enough in yourself and you love what
you're doing who gives a fuck what
anyone says that's what I said I don't
give a shit what anyone says about me
and I don't care about the hey I get
because I know a people that love me for
who I am and I love myself for Who I am
that's the most important thing to me to
be honest like dealing with hate I don't
deal with hate because I never get hate
the time of day if that makes sense do
you think that makeup brands should
start marketing to men as well um I do I
definitely do I think that like now
makeup for men is becoming much more
popular and much more mainstream and
straight guys like to work concealer so
you guys like to wear powder sometimes I
had tons of clients I'm Mac without
coming out or dudes I just wanted a
quick little coverup or something to
help their skin even out and I think
that brands really need to take that buy
like the balls no pun intended because
it's rig eyes grab them by the balls and
reel those bitches in with some ads with
dudes I know some companies do have
makeup for men but it's not right
mainstream and I think that they should
especially now what like it's 2015 I
think that men and make a busy becoming
much more of a popular thing so I think
that brands should invest in some shit
for some men also next mission what is
your favorite TV show and movie
well movie on Miami answer because I
have too many movies that I'm obsessed
with but right now I have a couple shows
that looks awesome so right now I am
obsessed with revenge
Kelly was getting cancelled on me gonna
don't you remind me Game of Thrones I'm
obsessed with daredevil on Netflix it's
like so random oranges any black
RuPaul's Drag Race what other shows do I
had dude I watch a bunch I don't know
the other ones are anime show so top or
bottom bitch really uh top rubato oh my
god when referring to the bunk bed and
which part of the bed I like to sleep on
top or the bottom I say that I like
sleep on both the top bunk in the bottom
bunk because why would you just cut off
a whole section of the bed when you can
enjoy both sides of the bed you know
what I'm saying
you know so I like sleeping on both the
top and bottom bunk of a bunk bed when
you get your first break in the makeup
industry understand go off of like
YouTube
industry because that's like what I do I
don't really do like makeup industry
stuff outside of social media the first
break I ever had was when this girl on
Instagram name Mona or nay on is her
real name banana is what she goes by
she's on Instagram she's a popular
Instagram artist
she's a beautiful and Korean girl so a
while back when I first heard my
Instagram she was one of the first
peoples ever like look at my work and
think that I was good and who would ever
give me advice on things and she was the
first person ever promo me on her page
which was way more popular than me she
had like 100 K and I had my 4 K and she
believed in my work and she was like
videos of me like twice I think she was
one of the most influential people for
me because she was the one that can
email a big break when she promoted me
like I gained thousands of followers and
because she promoted me I think Anasazi
Beverly Hills followed me I just feel
like I owe her so much because my social
media cuz she was the first person to
ever really see me I just want her to
know that she really helped me when I
was smaller in my account and I am so
grateful for her what was your reaction
to the Bruce Jenner interview ok do want
me to cry honestly I'm so fucking proud
of Bruce for coming forward and doing
that interview and I think it's so
commendable and I honestly don't even
care what anyone says if people thinking
that he's doing it for publicity or
whatever at the end of the day he still
went on camera in front of the whole
entire world broke down and came out as
what he wanted himself to be and so I'm
just so proud of him in that way because
I just feel like so I just feel like it
hits home because I put myself out into
the world and doing whatever the fuck I
want to do and it's it's hard it's
really hard he struggled with his
identity crisis young so I really I'm
just so happy for him to come out now
and start talking about it and I know
for a fact I saved so many kids lies the
bravery is actually so genuinely happy
and I'm so happy for Bruce I'm so happy
that you got to do that and ahh I'm just
really happy for him next person do like
sex yes um will you ever hahahah next
question will you ever date Patrick girl
no he's my bestie like we're not like
dating we're not like like that like
we're just not like that
we're not on that level where he's like

next uestion how is it like to meet
jacqueline hill um honestly it was
amazing it was totally amazing meeting
Jacqueline she was exactly how I
pictured her in real life like she is on
her videos she is so bubbly so hilarious
she's just as extroverted she's on her
videos if not more so in person and it's
just meet her clicked right away and she
was a star like my heart was like
pounding so fast like I was freaking out
because we're all going to dinner and I
was like she's someone that I looked up
to for social so long and just meeting
someone like that you look up to like at
that it's just like you're like freaking
out I was freaking out it was amazing
meet her she was just so kind she gave
me a huge hug and now I can say I'm
really close friends with her she's one
of my closest friends actually and she's
amazing and I love her exactly if you're
watching this I love you mija and do my
running though next question what
happened to baby sleepy is she locked up
for those of you who have followed me
since like the beginning of my Instagram
I used to do a character a chola
character named baby sleepy and it was
mirrored after Danny Noriega zhh angel
baby character and I just liked it just
fine like I saw Danny doing it and I
thought it was just the funniest fucking
thing ever and I was like you know what
he doesn't do it anymore so I thought
why not just take the troll out reigns
and I did I loved doing it and like I'm
sure if you guys went back in my
Instagram right now you would see like
those chill out videos of me being like
baby sleepy or whatever I don't do it
anymore because I feel like when I when
I was doing it it was like a crutch for
me I would do that character I knew was
funny so gained followers from it but
that's not what I wanted like I didn't
want to be known as the dude that does
the Chola character you know what I mean
so I broke away from that and I started
doing makeup more not that there's
anything wrong with doing a troll
character full-time like that's awesome
like that's totally cool all you so far
now she's locked up she's fucking locked
up right now for so don't even try it
out shit don't even try you know next
uestion is the biggest regret in life oh
damn you want to fucking get into the
real shit honestly like I don't really I
try not to have any regrets I've had
made a decision I feel like it is helped
me whether it's good or bad it's helped
me become Who I am today I try not to
live within your grasp but the one thing
I do regret is I wish that I was much
more extroverted as a child
and I wish I wasn't so scared of what
people thought of me cuz now I don't
give a shit what people think about me
and back then I gave every shit in the
world of what people thought of me so
that's like my one regret is I wish that
I was a little bit more confident as a
younger child it's not really regret
it's just something that was within me
but I really don't regret anything other
than the fact that I wish that I was
much more extroverted and much more now
give a fuck when I was younger because
it's helped me so much now with
everything so yeah I wish that I think
it was single solitary titty back in the
day but I did what any shows do you
watch don't even have time okay honestly
like for those who you don't know I'm
obsessed with anime like I love anime I
don't care if I'm fucking 24 I don't
give a shit I love anime and that just
was cold me and I probably love anime
for the rest of my life when I just
finished that I loved was parasite
attack on Titan that one's really good
sword art online Oh Hunter x Hunter was
so good I loved it um fairytale Legend
of Korra it's not really an enemy that's
a cartoon Soul Eater on top of my head I
can't remember but I love a bunch of
anime and I think it's amazing and I
love like diving my little life into
enemy who's oh my god is it on my door
boxers briefs or commando so how many
but just one real bad shit good I like
to do boxer briefs that's like my go-to
thing I like boxer briefs I like them to
be really tight and I like everything to
be in place and not roaming important
question who's your favorite Sailor
Scout okay when I was younger Sailor
Mercury was my favorite because she was
at the nerdy one she was a smart when
she was the shy one and I was the
dirtiest more shy kid so I was like
obsessed with Sailor Mercury to death
but now as an older I feel like I love
Sailor Jupiter like the really tall
bitch like the masculine ass tall bitch
with lightning she is flawless do you
have any projects coming up with any
brands you got
hypothetically speaking if I had
projects coming up with brands to create
products with them when you guys think
that I signed a nondisclosure agreement
to not talk about these products before
they launched so hypothetically I don't
know will Jardel asks when are we doing
a collab with a bitch you are trying

wears makeup
honestly Patrick was when I inspired me
I followed Patrick on my normal
Instagram for so long it was him one the
first inspired me because he was so
brave and doing what he does and I
really looked up to him because of the
fact that he was doing the makeup thing
as a boy and just didn't give shit what
other people said and so Patrick was one
that really inspired me first and yeah
