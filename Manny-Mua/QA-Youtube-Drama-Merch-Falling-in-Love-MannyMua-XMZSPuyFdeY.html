as you can see today's background is a
little bit different almost on our bed
today I'm in the process of moving still
and I don't have anything set up at all
for my room like I don't have any kind
of filming set up so I'm just filling my
bed my little sheets going so we're
gonna check to handle that floor now
sounds good take this is going to be a
Q&amp;amp;A video I posted on my snapchat and
that wasn't me doing Q&amp;amp;A video to ask me
questions on Twitter so everyone that
follows me on snapchat and on Twitter
knew that this is going to be happening
I just felt like that was for like my
true fall is my true maniax that we're
gonna like watch my snapchat and watch
my Twitter they knew I was into a Q&amp;amp;A so
if you did know I was doing one I'm
sorry I apologize but this is for all
you guys on Twitter and on snapchat so
this is for you guys
yeah other than that if you guys liked
this kind of video if you guys don't
like me don't watch you guys
know the drill with that one
okay but if you guys do like this video
and you guys do like me please subscribe
to my channel and like this video if you
liked it give that bitch a thumbs up cuz
you know yeah well so let's just start I
feel like your knees take a long IIST
wine first question I'm not gonna
announce anyone's names because I can't
pronounce yet okay
how did your parents take it when you
pursue make up instead of getting a
career using your batches of science for
those of you don't know I have a
Bachelors of Science in health sciences
I went to college for five years and I
have a degree so my parents at first
didn't really take it very well because
they didn't really understand what I was
doing they just thought like what the
hell is this little dude doing online
doing makeup and it's not gonna make no
sense to them they thought like you have
a degree like use your degree keep going
to school do you want to do like in your
health field and I was like you know
what's not really my plan it's not
really what I want to do I felt like
things have were happening for a reason
on social media so I told him I was like
you know what I really don't wanna
pursue that anymore and they were like
not happy they were not happy they just
didn't understand like they didn't know
what I was gonna do with my life and
they thought like what the like you
can't make a career out of this and I
was like I'm actually not mm-hmm they're
much more open about it now but they
were really scared at first they did not
understand what was going on so at first
they didn't really like it but now
they're much more open to it yeah and
they support me 100% what do you believe
is your one biggest flaw and one of your
best qualities love you I love you too
Mercedes I would say this one with my
flaw first I would say my biggest flaw
is probably overthinking everything I'm
a big thinker I'm a big over thinker I
think of everything way too much I feel
like it's part my personality like I
have an anxiety disorder a lot of you
guys don't know this but I've been
diagnosed with anxiety since I was 17
and I take medication for it every day
but I feel like I'm such an over-thinker
because I get anxious for things so I
think that's one of my worst qualities
because I feel like you don't I don't
need to be like this I just overthink
like crazy and I get really like I suck
myself out when I do this so I get like
super like like I'm like I just think of
the worst case scenarios night because I
overthink all the time but I would say
that's probably one of my worst
qualities I would say my better
quality is is I was just so weird like
you want to answer what your best
claudius that's up I'm weird it's like
so vain uh honestly like I would say one
of my better qualities is like I'm a
sweet I'm a sweet guy like I'm I'm
really loving and affectionate and
caring and people in my life that I love
like they know that like they know I'll
do anything for that was like that's one
of my better traits I'm so affectionate
and so caring and I just want to be
there for anyone that can be I'm a nice
guy like I'm actually like a sweet nice
dude when you get to know me like I'm a
nice guy
do you see yourself having slash
adopting children within the next 10
years um yes
totally oh wait we intend I'll
that's like really bad honestly like I
would totally love that children I think
that'd be such a cool thing I would love
to have like a daughter or a son
well rather a daughter to that version
do you still feel comfortable with
yourself when you don't wear a makeup or
do you feel naked well I would say that
I still feel completely one percent
comfortable like a hundred percent
comfortable I think that it's very
important to feel comfortable in your
own skin even if you're not wearing
makeup
even if here's someone that wears makeup
every single day I think it's important
for you to feel confident in your own
and so for me I feel 100% confident
without wearing any makeup and I feel
confident when I'm wearing makeup so I
think that's really important you do not
need to be wearing a full face of makeup
to feel confident yourself the skin that
you have the face that you have is gonna
be the face you have for the rest of
your life and you want to be confident
in it so I just think it's really
important to she's gonna fit in yourself
do you have any new collapse coming I
know you do don't lie in my chula in my
trilha voice maniac for life I do have
collaborations coming up but I'm not
allowed to talk about them actually one
of them's coming at them in this year
honestly like this next collaboration is
like slaying my entire existence it is
so good I'm not kidding like I cannot
wait for you guys dude if I know what it
is like it's so sickening you
guys gonna your titties you're just
gonna your pants you're gonna
your pants right on the floor
just like your pants when you see
what's going on like it's so good it's
so good I love it I'm so excited too bad
it's all like serenity to me limited
edition have you learned to whip and nae
nae yet boom no I can't whip a nanny I
just really can't that's like I know
it's like hmm it's like something like I
don't honestly don't even know it
because it's really hard it's like
watching me how much mean it's like you
like you whip you go down you whip
something and then you naynay backwards
like I honestly don't know like I can't
do it like I'm so like unwittingly
talented and that's a word this is a
question I like this one what is one
thing about YouTube you weren't
expecting and what is one thing you miss
that about not being on YouTube I'll
start with the latter first so the one
thing I miss about not being on YouTube
is I miss like having a normal schedule
like I miss having like a normal time
where I'm going to work because YouTube
is not only is it my copy but it's my
full-time job
social medias my full-time job like I'm
doing social we get 24/7 at all times
I'm always connected to my social media
because that's just like what I do I
kind of social media person so that's
one thing I miss is like being
disconnected sometimes you know from
like the world you know I don't want to
be connected all the time but I am what
is one thing you were not
expecting I was not expecting like the
cattiness that having on you to be kind
of sucks because I've had like my
moments and I have I've had like my like
miscommunications with people in the
beauty world and it just like it sucks
like you honestly do not expect that I'm
so like I just want us all to do well I
just want us all to do amazingly and I
want to also like be built up and like
build up each other but it's not like
that for everyone is I learn I can count
a couple people that don't like me like
on YouTube that are Beauty people that
don't like me at all and they just they
just don't like me like we've had a
miscommunications in the past and they
don't like me and that's fine they're
doing their own thing I'm doing my own
thing so it just sucks cuz like you
wanna get along with everyone like you
really truly want to get along with
everyone but it just does not happen and
it sucks and that's like a thing that
you need to learn when you're not going
on YouTube like like not everyone's
gonna like you and that's a hundred
percent okay not everyone has to like
you so and just remember to like if that
things like that happen like a lot of
times that people can be threatened by
you because of various reasons you know
what I mean so just keep doing your own
thing keep being yourself next question
does it inspire you to be a better
person knowing so many people look up to
you
hashtag man yet excited um honestly it
does a hundred thousand percent me like
a year and a half ago I was like a
little bitch I talk about this all time
I really care and people thought about
me I didn't give a about if I hurt
anyone's feelings I was just so
nonchalant I didn't give a because
I was so introverted in the past that
like when I became like when I came out
and I was gay oh so like I'm here I'm
queer like I don't give a what
anyone thinks I didn't care oh I didn't
care about hurting anyone's feelings but
being put in the situation that I'm in
on YouTube I just feel like people look
up to me you know I feel like there's
people that look up to me I want to be
someone that people would look up to and
I feel like YouTube has made that happen
for me I want to be someone that you
guys look up to I want to be that person
for you guys I want to be that like rock
or that person that you guys can look to
for inspiration or guidance or anything
that you need and that's what I want and
you guys have made me be a better person
I'm not kidding like a hundred thousand
percent I was I'm not the same person I
was a year ago and I know for a fact
that because of you guys on YouTube that
made me be a better person I'm not going
to be a like terrible bitch like
I want you guys to look up to that kind
of a person no no mMmmm I want
to be the best person I can be for you
guys at the end of the day okay what do
you think of Patrick being in the top
six in the next phase award I think it
is so amazing
I think it's so amazing I'm so proud of
Patrick he worked so hard to be on the
next like face wards and chopsticks like
I'm just so proud of him
I'm so proud of him it's not
even a joke little backstory it's really
funny so I was with Patrick and I was
with Jordan Hans drink I'm at strength
I'm SLA and we all were like talking
we're like dude we should totally like
all into the next face words together
just kind of like for shits and giggles
just for fun you know we should honor it
so me Patrick and Jordan house all
entered it mix and choose me mix didn't
choose me I'm not better don't even girl
honestly they chose Jordan and Patrick
and so I was like another rule out oh
bugger laughs I was kind of upset at the
time I wasn't and I can get top thirty
Nyx's said off Manny like Nick said
 off
Jordan was top 12 in Patrick's top six
and just so I could not be more proud of
them they did so well Jordan amazing up
watching me top six but she did so great
and Patrick I feel like is so deserving
to be in the top six I can't we from I'm
gonna be at the NYX award show like
ceremony whatever the it is like
the final showing to be supporting him I
can't wait I cannot wait I know he's
gonna do great who are your favorite non
Beauty youtubers Miranda sings Joey
Graceffa Connor Franta
honestly like I only ever watch a beauty
youtubers I don't really ever watch a
lot of other people and if I do it's
only like them I have like a very
specific like a regime who i watch ki
lolly and jce like Keenan JC like their
videos I love their videos so much say
those are my favorite people I like to
watch on better not be eating um if you
could clap with any youtuber and that
you haven't done so with already who
would it be question law Falls
 good honestly like I feel like I
would want to cut with someone that's
not in beauty I wanna do something
that's like fun
that's not beauty related you know
that's what I would want to do in the
collaboration like I would love to
collab with Gigi I'm not sure Joey
Graceffa gotta Club with
Joey grows up well huh and I'll
be sickening died probably Joey
do you ever see yourself starting such
having your own makeup line I love you
guys just kiss love you do I do I
honestly like I can totally see myself
doing that in the future if I'm I need
you for a couple years you know getting
the hang of things that getting of
collaborations like just kind of seeing
how things go
I would totally cream a brand I feel
like I do have a really good eye for
makeup and I feel like I know what I
like in product and I think that's like
a really good thing to have when you're
creating a brand you know your favorite
kind of formulas you know your favorite
kind of
you know if you ever kind of like
everything so I think that's really
important like when you're creating your
own brand and I would totally love great
my own brand one day and maybe that'll
be in the future who knows I don't know
what's gonna happen if you have no idea
but I think that'd be sick are
you team Jake or team Fitz Alonzo are
you doing this to me we're talking about
scandal scandal I ever know honestly I
don't even know yet I'm team Fitz like
I'm in team Fitz since day one obviously
kind of obsessed with it but as soon as
Jake onto the foot into the photo as
soon as Jay got into the picture I
realized that he was a character in
Grey's Anatomy that I loved and I truly
was obsessed with him I like loved him I
cried like I cried when I character was
in scenes so I just feel like that actor
he's like had a little pull with me like
I'm felling like heartstrings with me
like I'm wrong right my chordae
tendineae ER just like Jake's only made
a couple episodes like he's been in like
three episodes so far so I don't really
know his deeds yet I'm still team Fitz
like I think fit just so funny
I think he's like this well he's
gorgeous I'm obsessed with him like I'm
obsessed Fitz I wouldn't be Olivia Pope
right they're gonna be right between
that Pope can't you hardly wait to fall
in love damn that's a diva
actually I can't wait I'm waiting as
long as possible as you guys know I've
never had a boyfriend before I've never
been in love before I'm really scared
I'm really terrified to fall in love I
think it'd be so fun and great and like
ah but I'm also terrified of falling in
love because I know when I do I'm gonna
fall so hard and I'm I'm gonna fall so
 hard for like the guy I fall in
love with for the first time like it's
so scary but I think about it I
literally get so nervous I'm like I
can't do that because like what if we
break up and like I fall to the ground
and like cry and like have a
panic attack like that's one of you
that's what's gonna happen right like
I'm so scared of falling in love but I'm
so I really wanted to happen bump scared
I'm petrified like is even worth it like
it's love worth the pain damn I
said morbid oh I thought I saw
so glass half empty boom I am
excited to fall in love burns care what
product and brand would you collaborate
with I can choose any brand I would love
to work with like die for a
collaboration it would be probably
makeup forever
imagine how amazing it would be to be in
Sephora no one knows that film besides
Jacqueline you know like sing chocolate
inside Sephora is so inspiring tell me
that that's not inspiring for you guys
like that's like the most inspiring
thing ever to me like seeing her pursue
her dreams like that doing a club with
Becca like that is so
what amazing rhetoric like I die
it's so great um I'm so happy for her
and I think that if I could choose a
brand to collaborate with that I wasn't
Hardy collaborating right now my next
clubs are vague and zany besides awesome
I would definitely do makeup for ever
exciting me and make a fabric could
 kill the stain Slade Slade Slade
Slade Slade and last question to her
today is would you ever consider
creating merch figure maniax hell yes
I've been talking to people about it
I've been talking about to people about
doing merch and I think it'd be so
 fun like to create a little
Grayson hoodie that was so buggy I would
create a couple little things honestly
like I thought March would be so fun
like that for my maniacs like and for
those who don't know like maniax is the
term I use for those who follow me on
social media that are like my true
followers I like follow me on snapchat
Twitter YouTube everything on every
supply form with like maniacs is our

scouts like the Sailor Scouts which is
so kill or Manny acts like a
maniac but Manny so many yeah like from
you guys's vote Manny equi shows it was
like 80/20 I would definitely love to do
