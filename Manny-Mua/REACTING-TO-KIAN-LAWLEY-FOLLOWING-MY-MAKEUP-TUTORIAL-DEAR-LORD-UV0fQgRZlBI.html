another reacting video I actually did a
reacting video recently to my cringy
about Google which was kind of hard to
watch I'm not gonna lie that was a
little rough but recently I saw Ian
Lally I'm actually a huge fan of doing a
recreating of a man emu a makeup
tutorial which was mine and I was so
shocked that he chose a a video
from me like a year and a half ago free
hair line and I was like can either your
shading leave or you just don't know you
just so we're just gonna say you don't
know and I started watching and I was
reading the comments just cuz I'm
naturally like I just instinctively go
reading the comments and I'll have
people resting like oh my god manage to
do a reacting video to this I was like
so I literally pause the video where I
was at which is about like 3 or 4
minutes in and then I went all the way
to the end to see the video cuz I don't
wanna be an asshole might that be really
fun to do a reacting to his video
