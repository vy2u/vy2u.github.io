today's video is going to be I cannot
even believe I'm making this video the
other day I asked on Twitter what you
guys would like to see me do on YouTube
it just been like a minute since I
filmed it been a couple weeks actually
I've had a lot of videos pre-filmed
because I was supposed to be going to
Africa didn't end up going because it's
illegal to be gay in Tanzania so now I'm
like okay videos I need to get some shit
done so that's why I tweeted to you guys
asking what you guys would like to see
and I got this one comment and it was
man you should do a manual reacts to
Maine anyway repeating everything
Jeffery starts us for five minutes so
there is a video on YouTube and on
Twitter that like went viral I guess one
it went viral on Twitter literally me
repeating everything Jeffrey says for
five minutes straight cuz we've collab
so many times on both of our channels
and I guess I was repeating him/her
certain aspects of it at first I was
annoyed I'm like wait I do this with all
my friends why why is this turning into
a thing but quickly I got over it and it
was honestly just so fucking funny
watching the video I've seen it once and
a lot of my friends haven't texted me
about it and will always be like oh my
god girl like you do that all the time
and I'm like I know I do it all the time
but because I feel much Jeffrey the most
we had the most instances where I copied
him and it turned into a video whoever
edited that video god damn god damn you
in two hours you went through hours of
footage to get those five minutes but
hey honestly I'm kind of impressed I'm
kind of impressed not going to lie so I
thought it'd be really really fun to sit
back make fun of myself repeating
everything Jeffrey says for five minutes
I have not seen the video in a minute
I remember actually exactly what I said
in the video or what I did so dr. K's
video is going to be as always if you
guys don't like this video guys do not
like me please don't fucking watch it
you know that you're with that one of
you guys do like the video please
subscribe to my channel if you're not
already and if you're new what's up a
mani MUA and when to my channel thank
you so much for being here I really
appreciate it but yeah let's go ahead
and watch this video of me reacting to
anyway repeating Jeffrey's over five
minutes
oh my god three months ago bite and the
person that means shook no literally
like the first I mean it's name is shook
tossing out there shook man anyway
repeating Jeffrey for five minutes
straight Oh God
again Bozz let me get that literally
like cringing so fucking hard right now
thank you you guys mean your life you
guys know that I literally do this every
single one of my friends it's not just
Jeffrey I do this to I do it to Laura I
do to Joey I do it to Daniel I do it to
literally
Nikita Gaby I do it everyone in my life
because for me when I repeat something
that someone's saying it's just me and
green with them and just enforcing what
they said that's like how I see
repeating I guess I never really knew I
did it until this video happen and then
all my friends were like oh yeah you
totally do it to me and I'm like and you
never you never thought and you never
thought to bring it up to me no at the
deads
windings Center holes look at it and
they edit me to be like nothing I was
gonna say other things
I'm sure if you guys watch these videos
you guys won't you mean able to notice
that I do this but this person caught on
quick and made that coin
cake like more like cake like smelling
and I said it's cakey like it's a
heavier feeling is this a video
defending myself
no I want a living slaw might be the
main when I get to like hyper I get too
tight or something like the veins pop
same same I think that's my favourite of
all crime embers I remember that part
from the last I watched it expected oh
my god it's so payment it actually like
say it okay it's like an inside joke
with me Joey and Daniel like anything's
happening are just like so pigmented and
they just like laugh and die I love it
oh do we throw so many fucking videos
holy shit that's the best my best friend
right there that's green it's really
pretty crazy everywhere I'll keep my
eyes closed for sure all weekend
is everything everything we'll give it
okay well my right we can do it one more
any quantity its blinded it was it
really lies by me so loud so buddy
exactly and that is it you guys I hope
it was just as cringy for you as it was
for me at the end of the day honestly I
really don't give a fuck I think when
the memes happen or when someone says
something about me and it goes viral on
Twitter or on YouTube or something like
something happens and it's like a fun
huge moment I think it's actually really
fucking hilarious and it's like cool it
is literally just more promo for me and
for the people that are involved I don't
mind very much and even if it is making
fun of me I I make for myself every
single day that's why I have bloopers in
my videos that's why I fuck up in my
videos and don't edit it out I don't
mind at all like I literally do not mine
I think it's funny I used to be so like
people-pleaser crazy I used to really
care and I was like oh my god I was like
oh my god I as long as like I make them
happy or as long as I make the audience
happy or something like that but now I'm
just like fuck it bro bug as long as I'm
making myself happy and that's what
really matters the more hanging out with
Geoffrey the more hang out with Laura
the morning I would talk to you with all
of my friends the more I pick up on
their lingo the more things I say that
they say and I don't know why people try
to come from me or come from my friends
when like we talked similar to the other
when it's like yo we're spending copious
amounts of time together why would we
not say the same things because we have
the same inside jokes the same inside
stories things like that so I just think
it's pretty funny when people try to
come for us like that cuz I'm like at
the end of the day we're chilling at
home having fun being close friends and
that's all that really matters is having
close friends and close people that you
love in your life if you guys do this
too please comment down below that you
guys do it as well and if your friends
have pointed it out to you I think it's
so funny and honestly don't stop doing
it part of who you are and if you
front of you for it fuck um welcome you
having fun with your friends
and if people want to judge that hey
that's on them
you stay having fun with the people that
you have fun with so um yeah I can't
wait to make some merch I'm saying so
pigmented I probably well honestly I
might make a hat but there's something
we didn't I swear oh yeah you guys know
