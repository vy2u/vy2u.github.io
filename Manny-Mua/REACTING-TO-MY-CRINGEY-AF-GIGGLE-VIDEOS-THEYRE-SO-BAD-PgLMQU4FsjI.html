I had to do the giggle because today's
video is actually going to be a it's
gonna be a reacting video that's gonna
be reacting video and I have not done a
reacting video in so long actually
haven't done a reactant video since I
did a reacting to repeating which every
star set that was a video compiled of me
repeating things that Geoffrey said
technically have all my collaborations I
repeated like literally every single
person I've collaborated with I just
kind of I guess my thing I just
naturally her people people's sakes it
makes them feel more comfortable I like
looked it up because when I was like why
the fuck don't repeat so many things but
I guess it makes other people feel more
comfortable around you and things like
that and I guess I just naturally I just
do that whatever anyway I did a
reactivated to that and it was so much
fun and you guys really really really
liked it cuz it was so fuckin cringy and
I saw a video going around I haven't
watched it yet my parent myself it's a
little clip of it on Twitter and I'm
like oh my god hi delivery wanted to
scream because it was basically a video
compiled of all my giggles that I've
done in the beginning of my videos
basically if you guys are new here what
is up a man um you a and and every video
usually in every video or like and I
forget whatever the fuck it happens I
usually do like hey guys welcome back to
my channel and then I giggle and it was
such a natural thing at first like it
was such a normal thing and so someone
brought it up to me actually until you
guys fucking brought it up to me that's
what I'm fucking we're going to mean for
a night and now I instinctively just
like wanted to do wanna giggle like all
the time and if I don't get go people
like or like why the fuck did you fuckin
giggle are you mad today you sad you
upset or what the fuck's wrong with you
and I'm like no it's just kind of one of
those things you know it's like a giggle
just has to happen I'll forget sometimes
and sometimes I remember it is what it
is basically it's like every single one
of my giggles and my videos combined and
I'm like like I don't want to see it I
don't really want to I think it'd be so
fun to do a reacting to it video so I
searched on YouTube like man um you
ain't giggling and there's like a video
that popped up and it's like me giggling
and I'm but I think it'd be really
really fun so I'm gonna do it okay guys
so that's what today's video is going to
be to be a reacting video to that really
fun so I'm just gonna pull it up on my
phone screen record it and see what it
is so I thought I'd be really really fun
to do it that way that's it for today's
video as always if you guys don't like

Laura okay y'all honestly I can't do
this anymore you know I just can't
because it's really rough it's really
rough in these streets how about Michael
Kors laughing at Mannie me way in James
Charles kind of looks like something you
would see on the sale rack in an active
department her activity looks like she's
good no not from the show bitch I was
serving looks though I was trying it
really I mean she could put cookies in
her pocket you want guys to leave you
alone in the gym wear that look no one's
I think it's first off you can't move
second off you pooped in your pants and
the pockets fucking pleasure me pockets
they're a little creepy creepy no no
it's borderline like a Tina Turner dress
it looks like Tina Turner
it would probably be on the markdown
rack you thought about the function and
you lost the fashion I still think it's
a fat check getting a cooking oh no
don't do the pleasure me pocket okay
that's enough cringing for one day I'm
gonna go ahead and let this go No
Wow is all I have to say about that okay
y'all that just happened
I'm a little mortified I'm not gonna lie
I'm a little cringed ow I'm a little
embarrassed so that was rough
I'm not gonna lie that was a little
rough mmm but honestly for some reason
like these reacting videos are so
fucking fun to do like I almost want to
do reacting to like drama channels
making drama videos about me you're like
doing it like cringy stuff like this cuz
it's honestly so much fun to just sit
back and kind of make fun of yourself I
think it's really really fun I'm not
like a serious serious person I really
pride myself on not taking myself too
seriously actually and I think that you
guys know this quite well and I've done
so many cringy things in my life and in
my career and it's just so fun to look
back on and be like yo I did that can I
even believe and it's one of those
things words like well hopefully you've
learned your lesson and you want to move
on and you want to become better or like
change yourself in some way if you feel
like you should do you guys remember
last year I think it's last year are you
2 years ago maybe I don't remember but
it was like there's like a video
circulating of me like trying to get on
Kylie's PR list and I was in Bora Bora
and I was like I wish you can get on
that PR list and like I honestly at the
time never thought anything of it I
think it was like a big deal I didn't
think anything of it whatsoever
but it turned into such a fucking thing
it looks so like annoying on my part cuz
I'm like over here I'm in fucking Bora
Bora with Tarr wishing I was on Kylie's
parallettes and it's like oh yeah many
oh yeah we get it your we get it honey
you're you're cursed you have a hard
life you know what I mean and at the
time I'll just thinking like you know I
want to spend I wanna be I was perilous
I also wanted to do a giveaway and
things like that but you all it's
actually really really funny looking
back on it and just seeing those videos
circulate and I'm like kind of cringing
it's kind of crazy I'm not gonna lie I
just look like a little brat hey I
learned my lesson and it is what it is
and I was on the gag though the gag of
it all is that bitch when I got back
from Bora Bora with tart I already have
my package at the fucking door Kylie's I
was already on Kylie's PR package my god
all that for fucking nothing like her
fucking
