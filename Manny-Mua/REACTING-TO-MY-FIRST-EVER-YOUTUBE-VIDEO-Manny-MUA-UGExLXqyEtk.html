it today's video I'm so excited to be
filming because it's kind of a
random-ass video for me I've never done
anything like this I'm going to be
reacting to my first ever YouTube video
I have not seen my first youtube video
in a very very long time so I'm really
excited to do this I just think it's
gonna be fun to see where I was almost
three years ago I started my channel in
July of 2014 so it's been almost three
years now in a couple months it'll be
three years and interested I just think
it's gonna be fun to see where I was at
that point in my life as always if you
guys like this video if you guys do not
like me please don't fucking watch it
you know that Jill with day no I just do
that but you guys do like this video
please subscribe to my channel if you
weren't already and if you're new what's
up a man anyway and welcome to my
channel thank you so much for being here
I really appreciate it
so it's going to get into this video of
me reacting to my first ever YouTube
video shit look I look at the video
right here I'm gonna pull it up on my
laptop and I can do like a screen share
type situation my first ever video was
the everyday foundation routine by
Maggie anyway let's do it okay let's
click it two years ago an ad oh my god I
was making money even back then okay
skip bad bitch come on okay oh my god
you said okay and he said okay let's
look at the little description box
because I do those all the time click HD
for the high quality ish okay well
apparently I thought my little tiny
noise high quality bactine what the fuck
am I even saying okay YouTube children
basically this is my everyday foundation
routine for y'all I kind of cost a lot
I'm trying to get that shit under
control I'll learn to bleep things out I
swear but not yet oh my gosh and I keep
looking into the viewfinder and not the
lens I'll get better at that too by the
way my room looks like a mess because
we're moving soon and it's a wasteland
in there urn here this will not be
permanent forever and then I list all
the products that I used and I
apparently I say insta Jeezy instead of
Instagram who did I think I was full
screen mode look at me I look fucking
angry what the fuck and skinniest bug -
what the fuck
oh I love myself coherently by the way
I'm wearing this shirt because this is
like one my first trips I ever wore on
YouTube it's like maybe like three or
four videos and I'm wearing this exact
shirt and so the longest I've ever owned
a shirt is this one so I thought it'd be
fun to throw this back as well let's go
and start this everyday foundation
routine with mani MUA from almost three
years ago oh shit
so this video I'm about 22 or 23 years
old and I look like I'm an infant for
some reason I don't know but I look
little young here I'm in my bedroom I
didn't have anything I had two soft
boxes and my little Canon camera and a
dream basically I don't really know
anything about backgrounds or lighting
or literally anything like that were
about buzzing I think sure I have
buzzing noise in the back of this video
and let's start this motherfucker
did you know apparently I was getting a
lot of questions on Instagram back then
but it's actually funny to see me like
being so skinny and my teeth be a little
more fucked up and more yellow and
having a tongue ring Jesus criminy do
call my fucking tits with the cursing
okay moisturizer uh-hum pet the shit in
like you pat your weave oh okay I'm such
a little cocksucker oh my god all those
rings oh my god you guys I was a ring
fanatic I loved loved loved wearing
rings till these rings or my mom's two
of them were my own that I bought like
randomly at school and at the fair and I
was a ring fanatic since they fucking
one man and I'm probably my face right
now it's just so funny to see like me
doing these weird themed definitely
funny
got it I know that dealing with house
made me sweaty look at my little teeth
when I work in Safari was already
working on Mac attacks really funny cuz
when I was working at Sephora if you
guys are familiar with workers at
Sephora if you work at Sephora or any
I'm sure the tons of stores like this
you guys get gratis aka you get free
things that just come out for the first
time I guess like you get new releases
and you get them for free to try them
out so you can sell them potentially you
know I'm saying so I remember when I was
leaving Sephora it was just one thing
where it's like I was doing training and
I did the whole entire training and get
to do the train to get the gratis and it
was like the best gratis we were ever
gonna be getting and I did have any
money I'm just a fucking Sephora I was
getting $12 an hour like it was I had no
money no anything and I really was
trying to excel in my makeup career you
know I mean are trying to just practice
and do my thing and I remember this is
the best price we were ever gonna get
and it was so amazing but I was gonna be
leaving work soon you know I was gonna
be working at Mac and a week prior I had
put in my two-weeks and so I had the
whole week left and I was with me
getting my gratis and my manager like
put a stop my gratis because she's like
no you're gonna be leaving anyway like
you don't deserve the gratis and I went
off on her like a mother fucker actually
I'd really go off on her personally I
went off on that person that was above
her and I was like you know what I think
this is so fucked and I went through
that training and I deserve this and I'm
still here for a week selling your shit
for a week so I deserve this gratis and
my ass got it and she was so pissed but
I got the gratis and I was like oh la so
I remember this foundation being a
fucking full ass coverage hey hey hey
what I say wait wait wait stop stop stop
well um now covergirl does to cover boy
shoutout to james and so does Maybelline
like they're really bad it's funny cuz
it watching this - I'm talking so much
like angel baby I used to do this like
little chole that character thing that I
loved doing on my channel for so long I
would do it on my Instagram and I loved
angel baby aka Danny Noriega
okay adore Delano and I absolutely loved
her and I would do this little cholita
boys that I was inspired by her to do so
um yeah that's what I'm talking like the
way I'm talking feel like I was more
ghetto back then a little bit okay oh
I'm ratchet I'm fuckin ratchet tell em
nothing's changed Cody airspun since day
one all the drag queens would use this I
remember I can't believe I use this
three years ago
drag queens would live for Cody s one
and I would too Clem your tits calm your
fucking tits man II really
I love how like I was living for the
highway back then like living for the
Anasazi aglow like that little like
highlighting thing which was not very
glowy at all and back then I was like oh
I knew like I was living for living my
fucking gig
okay guys so back then I didn't have a
lot of money of course I was using elf
brushes Real Techniques brushes mostly
and the more expensive things that I do
have the mark dig up stuff and the uh
Nastasia palette was from work and
that's kind of why I had it mmm oh it
looks it looks a little muddy though uh
but okay I need to stop talking like a
fucking cholita clearly I was living for
my chili today's when I was a baby
sleepy in the past you guys are a maniac
since day one
baby sleepy you guys know she's in there
she's in here actually hmm
come on masculine mani with that fucking
one of those fuck do your lips manager
your lips come on show it show it living
for the nude since day one flush pot the
lash pot bitch okay look a little bit
its woman damn nude lid
that was my Mac look with the low
glasses everything and the blind the
black studs in my ear not the white ones
that the black studs in my guys okay you
guys and that is it for my entire first
ever youtube video it's just really cool
to see where I started you know I see my
personality back then I feel like I am
very very similar to I was back then
however I was just a little bit more
reserved and shy back then and I was
doing that cholita fuckin the way I was
talking to kind of compensate to make me
feel a bit more comfortable you know
kind of throwing that out there so
people wouldn't see my real personality
as much now I feel like I'm showing that
a lot more and like I just show Who I am
online now but back then I was a little
bit more like can just be someone else
really quickly and so I would play that
character uh for a while because I was
still a little bit uncomfortable with in
my shoes you know what I mean you know
back then I was a little bit more shy I
was a little more reserved I was a
little bitchy ER to be quite honest I
wasn't really as willing to put up with
people shit back then I guess in a
different way though it's in a different
way like back then out be more defensive
I was a lot more defensive back then and
I was kind of throwing out this
character and just being like I'm a
badass fucking bitch like try me kind of
thing because I think it was my defense
mechanism just starting YouTube you know
I knew was gonna be hard and I knew
people were gonna try to hate me and I
knew all these things and I think I was
doing this little fucking character to
make up for the fact that I wasn't
really asked comfortable with people
judging me
in the beginning and I feel like now I
don't really give a fuck I'm just who I
am Who I am
that was me three years ago you know
what I mean and now I'm 26 years old I'm
twenty five six five six but I am so
much more sure and aware of Who I am
today
I don't say thank you guys so much for
the continued love and support you guys
show me every fucking day of my life and
I can't even thank you guys enough
you know seeing me back then I never
would have thought in a million years I
could be where I am today and that's why
I feel like I've changed and a lot of
people try to clock me nowadays and
being like you've changed so much since
the beginning you were so much more
humble and so much more real and blah
blah blah like say whatever the fuck
they want to say
it's fine but it's actually funny cuz
back then I was a lot more sheltered and
not real and I was putting on a facade
for so long because I was scared of
showing who I really was and now I'm not
well sorry so it just it's cool to see
um my journey and see where I came the
embarrassing watching in first video
guys that's just embarrassing I don't
think I did too bad for my first ever
video on YouTube and I was a little
scared I was a little shy but I was
still cracking some fucking stupid ass
jokes bitch got jokes is there one I
cannot wait to see what we have in store
for the next three years and to see what
YouTube and what any other social media
platform takes us I always tell you guys
it's not just my journey it's our
journey and you guys allowed me to do
what I love and I know I say it all the
time and I'm cheesie's fuck like I get
it
but I chose a thank you and I just feel
like sometimes thank you isn't enough
it's not a strong enough word before I
go though I just wanna say one thing
always believe in yourself do not let
anyone else's opinions deter you from
the journey you want to take you know
what I mean I was gonna be a plastic
surgeon that was the glue I wanted to be
I went to college you know I got my
Bachelors of Science degree in health
science and I was in the process of
going to med school and applying to med
schools when I was working at Sephora
and iMac you know but that wasn't the
dream I wanted to do I loved it I
thought I thought I did you know but
when I fell into makeup that was my real
passion and what I really wanted to
follow so I wanna let you guys know that
anything is really possible you know I
never thought it was gonna happen to me
are you fucking kidding me like my life
now what our never knew two million
years I didn't start it for that I
started it because this is my passion
and I thought it would be fun to share
my creativity online with other people
and I would have never known it Katie
got this far so thank you and I want you
guys to remember to follow your fucking
dreams because it's important and your
dreams are important and they're valid
buck man I want people to follow what
they want to do stop listening to other
people stop listen to your siblings stop
listen to your parents stop listen to
your friends don't let the peer pressure
you into doing things you don't want to
do you don't fucking have to you know
what I mean do what you want to do and
that's fucking joining the circus if
that's being a lawyer that's what it is
do it I promise you when you do what you
love it doesn't feel like work okay but
yeah guys I love you I'm sorry for the
end spiel I just gave but I want you
guys to always be happy
