is up I'm not filmed in show fucking now
and I feel a little bit like out of it
to an on vacation with my family and to
Hawaii and it was amazing it went too
kawaii it was like literally like so
wonderful my parents worked so fucking
hard so they really really deserved a
really cool family vacation so we did
that and next week I actually go to
Japan for eight days and so I'm like
bitch I need to get some shit going the
tattoo is healing beautifully by the way
she is healing and she is feeling
herself the other day actually posted my
first Instagram photo and a little
collage of a photo of me recently this
is the photo right here and I actually
saw a couple comments saying recreate
your first Instagram look in a video and
I'm like that's a great idea so Mariah
thank you for that idea Olivia as well
I'm gonna show you guys I'm show a
little screen recording right here I've
like the comments showing and I was like
wait should I do that actually sounds
like a really really really fun idea
recreating your first Instagram look or
your first Instagram post I only know
I'm gonna tell this I also saw it Mikey
did a video similar to this as well so
shout out to Mike you for doing a video
like this as well that photo oh my god
let's move on let's take a look at it
how long ago that photo of me was me so
I'm gonna have to squirt out on my
fucking Instagram you gotta be kidding
me you've gotta be kidding okay I'm
scrolling they're going yeah damn she's
looking rough okay we are scrolling
still scrolling bitch still oh when I
came out with serenity Kylie Jenner wore
serenity that was everything look at me
like I was doing some weird-ass shit I
was doing some weird shit yo and I live
nothing was more creative back then
nothing was more creative back then but
I feel like I had more time to play with
makeup I did things back then I think if
I can recreate my whole shit they're my
first post on my Instagram it is posted
March 19 2014 which was over four years
ago it's four years in two months is
when I started my Instagram four years
and two months and that's what I look
like that's my first post so yeah you
guys ought not be really really fun to
just do a recreating of it this looks
specifically I have my base on already
because I just I would be like redundant
to like do my base how I normally do my
base because I want to recreate this
look basically I'm taking a more modern
take on it so yeah you guys have to say
this video is going to be I'm gonna be
reading my first Instagram post and
let's see I'm a little necklace and the
pose to go cute okay anyway guys as
always realized I like this
guys do not like me please don't fucking
watch it you know the drill with that
y'all know the fucking team
don't watch me if you don't like me but
if you guys do you like this video
please go ahead and click like and
subscribe to my channel if you're not
already and if you knew what's up I'm an
emu and welcome to my channel thank you
so much for being here and honestly to
think you guys in general for being here
and watching my videos and just being a
supporter of mine you guys are so
fucking wonderful and I honestly can't
imagine my life without you guys so
thank you thank you thank you from the
bottom of my heart like I'm really
really really lucky to do what you do so
thank you guys for allowing me to do it
anyway that's going to get into today's
video he's the first things first guys I
left my brows on my lips and my eyes not
done because those are the things that
sent out to me the most it's not like I
can pull my hair line forward do I see
this photo look how little I was I was
such a skinny little ride people are
like oh my god you've had so much
surgery in this but I've actually had
not any surgery I don't I've had filler
and I've had Botox but that's all I've
got and it's cuz I'm doing this like
weird thing you guys see my brows I was
this forward because I was punching
forward and I was posing like trying to
be on mask and shit with my fucking
lashes so don't think that I got a lot
of surgery because I really did it on
the face I wish it did
but nothing's changed other than my
hairline and my teeth and my skin and
the fat on my face and my seal so it's
gonna get right into this video as you
can see my brows are way too fucking
dark in that photo so we are going to do
the brow how I normally do brows now
which is taking on associate taupe dip
brow and we were going to carve out our
brows and do one on camera so you can
see what I'm doing I take a little more
fee and one five eight just like a
little brow brush great for powder or
for could I need that like this I'm
using the back of the cap to do this to
find it out it looks like what I like to
do random me my come on brow tutorial
we're going to go ahead and fill in the
brow I took go from the front of my brow
underneath my brow and just sweep up I'm
sweeping
I'm sweeping this is where I like to
like make my line or where I want to
like create the Browns that makes any
sense at all right there anything above
this line I want it to look a little bit
more filled and thicker you see that
boom look at that thickness bitch that's
bigger than a snicker bigger than my ass
now I'm just getting that thing's
fucking thickest fuck bitch my ass has
its own orbit I'm not gonna lie it has a
moon circle thing okay I'm gonna go
ahead and use the same dipper I'm just
gonna kind of feather the front softly
with my hand in that picture my brow is
so harsh because
use lip pencils from wet-and-wild back
in the day because I didn't really have
any money so I was using brown lip
pencils that's also why he doesn't match
my hair and it's so warm an intensely
dark brown it's actually kind of funny
doing this video and almost like
reminiscing on my past cuz that's
literally what it was I was using a lip
pencil from Wet n Wild that was
literally $1.00 to practice and do my
brows because I didn't have the Monte
and also it was such a secret like my
family didn't know I was doing makeup so
song I could ask them for money to use
for makeup you know or I couldn't like
ask my mom for her makeup I would like
have to go in and my take her makeup use
it and put it back in the mornings and a
really weird tumultuously y'all I'm
gonna get my parents on my channel one
day I don't know when and I want to get
my mom and I want to get my dad on my
channel in separately or together
doesn't matter just to talk about like
things with them from a parent's
perspective you know as like coming out
and being gay growing up religious
growing up Mormon and things like that
and I feel like it would be really cool
and really helpful for other parents out
there or other kids struggling because I
get it I struggled for so long and I
know it might seem like I have like all
my shit together
and I'm like bad bitch but I hadn't
worked for it so don't everything that
you see someone online and like oh my
god though life looks so perfect so
wonderful I wish I had that life you
guys don't know what like that struggles
like they had to deal with before that
if it seems like your life isn't as
glamorous or as fun as theirs it will
get there as long as you believe in
yourself and you want it for yourself
this is the brow by the way right here
just a quick clean up with someone
sealer but this is the new brow this is
what I like to do with my brows now
something bold but something my color
okay I'm finish the brow off the camera
I'll be right back okay cool so we got
the brows on and this is what they look
like now this is how I do my brows now
you know it's a little more dramatic
it's a little more intense I just enjoy
it a lot more
sometimes I go to less traumatic than
this sometimes like a more dramatic and
it just kinda depends on my mood you
know I feel like brows change every
single day it's like an outfit that's a
bra fit so Baisley as you guys can see
in this photo it is March so I don't
know why I'm doing a Christmas color
story no idea why I did a Christmas
color story it's like a red green and
gold eye you know what it's like a color
story at work kind of day I know we did
that so far away it was like it was like
oh here's the theme for today and come
in with this theme maybe it was like a
Christmas theme this day even though
we're in March I have no fucking idea
basically we're just gonna recreate this
exact look with the red on top green on
the lower lashline and golden in a
corner and gold on the eyeliner area now
we're gonna be taking a red shadow guys
take any red eyeshadow that you guys
want to I'm gonna be taking
shadow myself any rent shadow works for
this we're gonna go on oh fuck that's
pigmented uh-huh we're going with the
fluffy brush this is anna morphe m535i
stick brush I'm just kind of working
your way up so it doesn't like go to
intense and doesn't go to pink on you
Reds just naturally like to go pink when
they're blended out as you can see it
looks a little bit pink but advance
water I take a big fluffy brush with no
product on it its blend those edges and
as we get a little bit lower into the
eye we're gonna go ahead and pack on
with a more dense shadow now the color
is more red because we're actually
packing on with a denser brush is that
more if you are 39 so now you guys so
now we're taking that red shadow we're
gonna go and pack it on into the corner
and like lightly press let it blends
into the transition you read because the
transition you read looks different than
the packing read it just does read is
just so fucking okay now we're since
we're getting lower and lower I'm gonna
go with even more dense and more packing
brushes this is a morphe M 210 I'm
taking that same red shadow and I'm
packing on the lady I see that does it
get lower to the lash line I'm packing
on color and it looks more and more red
in the morning packet brought in that
bitch Shana you could always of course
go in with a red base that's totally
fine too I just decided to just go right
in with the red eyeshadow I'm like why
not well any blending to make sure that
the edges are clean as clean as we can
really get it honestly buttoning out red
can be tricky little trickster guys
blown out fuck oh so this is the eye
right now this is the read on if you
want to make the red a little bit deeper
going with a little bit of black on the
actual lash line like done here that
just deepens a little bit of everything
so keeps the red looking as you can see
it makes it a little bit deeper I just
want to be slightly deeper I have no
idea what I used back in the day like
that was four years ago I don't even
know what the fuck was in it what
shadows was I using I've no idea like
none none at all so for the bottom
lashline it is green as we can see it's
fucking green as hell but it's smoky
green it's not just green so I'm gonna
go in with the Marc Jacobs blacker
eyeliner and I'm gonna go and smoke that
out on my lower lash line right here
we're gonna blend that oh we're gonna do
a good hefty amount because it is smoky
scrolling down your Instagram is
literally the craziest thing because
it's such a memory lane that's why I try
not to delete any of my old photos or
anything I thought even when Mike the
looks were a little more rough or like
things were just looking
as cute as I'm taking a Murphy 18 it's a
memory for me that's like where I was in
that moment of my life so I try not to
erase anything on my pages like at all
just I feel like it's so like that was
my life you know that 4-year old me all
the different time honey that was a
different time in this game it was so
different you know back then it was like
share for share like shout outs for
shout out and the people would do
collabs on Instagram like they would do
like a look and it would be inspired by
someone else something do do like looks
together and things like that by the way
I'm taking this stunning green shade
from Pat McGrath this is gonna be a
modern twist on my whole look really
good glittery green I'm ready to clap I
did with Jordan Hans she is a really
badass a body painter I did some with
Mikey just like so crazy how things have
gotten pretty fucking nuts like it's
gotten crazy
I think it's been crazy I'm taking the
shade of Midori from sugarpill there's
blending that oh fuck basically I'm
trying to say is that it was a very
different time back then and I
appreciate getting to be here now
you know what I mean anyway you guys
we're gonna go and take the dew drops
from colour-pop these are the loose
simmer simmer powders I love these so
much I put a bunch onto this cap I wanna
take a little bit of mixing medium this
one is from a run it's called mixing
liquid I'm gonna add a little bit of a
drop into it just cuz I want to make a
gold eyeliner normally have any gold
liner on hand right now I don't know
where any of them fucking way honestly
this is the eyes of one what do we think
what do we literally like concocting
right now I love this shake it's like a
really really really intense deeper gold
can I use this to highlight my face
not really but as a gold liner I
literally just thought of this Rhino me
I'm like will this work I have no idea
we're gonna try it custom gold liner and
it's working
that's totally working fuck yeah fuck
yeah man you for the win bit fun
creativity and stunning this where were
you guys four years ago that's all I
know where the fuck were y'all did you
think that your life would be taking the
turn that it's at right now like that's
what I'm curious about like cuz for me I
never thought four years ago that I
would be at the vision I am now like
never in my wildest dreams I started
back in the day when people weren't
starting to make money and to do that
kind of thing like to make a career at
social media people started back then
because they thought it would be great
to share their art and like their love
for the craft of makeup and things like
that and I know it's definitely gotten
to the point now where it's about like
people joining they want to make money
like that's what it is do your things
make your coin I guess I feel like a big
reason that people aren't as successful
nowadays as I was starting back them one
saturation there's a lot of people
trying to do it and two people are not
being in it for the right reasons you
know what I mean I feel like when I
started back in the day I started
because I just feel like that was not a
lot of boys a beauty back in the day and
I was like man this sucks like there's
no representation for the men it was
hard like it was super super hard for me
back then it was like Patrick of course
it was the vanity Diaries Henry
so I just feel like I came in at a very
intense time where it's like I was
starting for the sake of wanting to be
represented in the boy world because I
really thought make it was so fun and my
bio on my Instagram says I think boys
deserve more cosmetic recognition and I
started my Instagram with that and it's
never changed I'm never taking it off
because I still think that there's such
a fight for men and makeup and I mean
I'd do my fucking best it's still
predominantly a female ran industry of
course we'll just totally find mostly
women wearing makeup there's no denying
that that doesn't mean that we don't
wear it too you know what the boys don't
worry cuz we do take this gold chain
right here just a pad a little bit on
top just make it a little bit more puffy
no no that's gonna work but this shadow
is too flaky to stick but hey okay so
this is what we have so far on the eye
and on the inner corner I had a really
really bold golden thing I don't know
exactly what it was I have no idea still
to this day what the fuck was on my
inner corner but we're gonna go and do a
concoction you know I love cock
concoctions I mean of course we're gonna
take heavy metal glitter liner in gold
yes bitch
oh yes bitch oh hunting we really put a
lot on there my photo has a lock on
there too so I'm trying to like really
you know live the fantasy for the sake
of the photo okay cool
so that is that she looks like a
Christmas special a fucking Christmas
special okay if we happen to go do my
other eye off of camera and I'll be
right back okay we had the lashes on now
back then I have no fucking idea well as
I was wearing I know I probably got them
at a dollar store stacked a bunch of
them that's all I could really afford at
that time I'm wearing the glasses Miami
right now just to kind of get us goin
that's going also I did a quick outfit
change because I was wearing a colored
shirt that was like my uniform at
Sephora back in the day wasn't this
exact one of course but something like
it okay guys so what was I wearing on
the
Laros they'll AAP nothing a hard nothin
I made looks like I'm wearing just gloss
it's definitely a glass of some type I
have no idea what color of glass so
we're gonna go ahead and vamp her on the
fuck up by the way guys if you guys are
ever wondering why I keep looking over
to my left cuz my viewfinder and I try
to stay in focus as you can see right
now I'm out of focus and I know I'm not
because I might not hit my little square
so that's why if you guys are always
wondering Manny why do you keep looking
over to the left looking at your
viewfinder is gonna have to go back into
focus we're gonna take a little bit of
the Urban Decay stark-naked lip liner
just a little bit doesn't define the
lips a hair I haven't gotten a lip
filler ever so my lips should be the
same
let's back into the day we're gonna go
and take moonchild eye color pop in miss
Kathleen
okay nude gloss definitely go look at
more of a sheer layer something wasn't
anything full coverage okay guys so this
is the final look this is my first
Instagram post re-envisioned let's go
and take a photo bitch I wish I could go
to my car I'm gonna take a photo in the
carb it's 9:10 at nighttime and my car
interior is black and my car interior
back in the day was white so just looks
stupid
oh that's how much I do it maybe I can
have my editor impose my face I'll let
me just recreate this and impose my face
on to my face so basically I look very
brooding very brooding very mask for
