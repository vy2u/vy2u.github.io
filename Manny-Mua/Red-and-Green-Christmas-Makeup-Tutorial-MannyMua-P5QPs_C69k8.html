today and starting off different gym
starting off with no makeup doing my
intro with no makeup on I think this is
Miro weird cuz I'm a-gonna hot mess so
let's just jump right into it so many
people requested for me to do that like
green and red smokey eye so I thought I
would film it right now I'm kind of 6 I
don't know if you hear it in my voice
but I have like the sniffles and so I'm
gonna try to edit as much as I can like
around it like you know I mean some
let's just get right into them yeah I
don't know hopefully you guys like it
and let's just jump right in yeah
everything's first let's go ahead we're
going to deal with the whole face today
hoping today we're going to go in with
the YSL fusion ink foundation in the
color warm ivory this is a gift from one
of my friends I'm gonna just use it in
this tutorial I have like a some facial
hair beard this thing going on right now
so I figured I might as well do it more
sheer to medium coverage foundation so
it doesn't really interfere with the
beard area I love the smell this
foundation so it sounds like roses and
I'm just I put on the back of my head
and just smear it on and then we're
going to go in with the morphe M 439 I
haven't used this brush yet I keep
hearing about great things about it says
huge huge like debuffing brush and so
I'm really excited a transfer out I'm
just gonna press it into my face the
foundation in um yeah I did it Patrick
Starr uses this one all the time and he
always tells me that it's such a great
or you brush for like that your brushed
finish and the foundations I feel like a
little bit light for me I know I'm
already like ghostly pale but I know
this foundation is a little bit light
but for me I to go on with foundations
they're a little bit lighter than me
because I always I can always bronze up
after you know and I try to avoid the
under eye area and much as much as I can
being somewhere I can go to concealer
under that mm-hmm
so now I'm gonna go in with Mac Pro
Longwear concealer in nw20 nuts and go
bahar I like to go pretty hammer the
concealer and on the eyelids to prime
for our eye shadow and then I'm gonna go
in with the morphe m35 which is
basically the mini baby concealer
version of them I'm obsessed with Raja
and using it quite a lot actually and I
love this because it really picks up
anything I don't need like it because of
all the excess product I don't need on
the brush you know see that does
what freaked the hey I was running
the brush anywhere that might need a
little more coverage I usually have a
little bit more breakouts my forehead a
little bit makeover with a little bit
more foundation on that area I do love
this on nation I really do the only
thing I mean I've said it before the
only thing I don't like about it is that
if I have any dry patches it tends to
pick up all my dry patches a little bit
and I don't like that at all
it's like bitch I need you to cover not
to show that's wrong with you
 caspere I'm use le GoPro powder
I've never used this powder on myself so
I'm here to see how this looks
I'm all curious about this piece
my roomie you know so I'm gonna grab a
morphe M 401 which is this large natural
hair fluffy brush that's extremely soft
go right into that she didn't just dab
all my things
okay I think too bad it's not so bad I'm
not gonna line so give me that nice HD
silica layer you know let's go ahead and
bronze real quick because I feel like I
look like hot-ass mess okay we're gonna
go in with the Sophie cosmetics 101
which is just like tapered petal fluffy
brush and the morphe contour palette and
we're gonna grab the mill shade I'm just
going to run it in my areas that I like
to call them sole okay
I'm wearing a beanie because my head I
woke up looking like a real hot mess to
be like real terrible so that's why I'm
more than maybe looking a goodness aster
mm-hmm because you know you know it
isn't your second you're just like I
don't care how I look right now I'm just
gonna do it anyway that's what I feel
that's why I was like I'm gonna keep the
facial hair I'm not gonna shave I'm not
gonna get my tit that's why I'm gonna
grab my morphe m4 38 I've talked about
this in my favorites video it's amazing
and Mac Pro highlighting powder in a
facade let's and go underneath her eye
was lit up those cheekbones bitch come
on bones for years now I'm contour
cutting those cheeks the shade
once is enough and my maken-ki crown
blush brush hmm such a different man
just a little bit of that color off to
the temples of one loan I'm starting to
look alive
not so cath burnish how do I did that
throat okay look I'm rockin let's go on
some blush I'm thinking for blush we're
gonna do spellbound I make a geek which
I think Dean's are named morphe g8 brush
which we run on our blush area nothing
too crazy don't I just look so chipper
for the highlight we're going to go in
with artists coat or powder made with
macdaddy
mermaid fantasy which is basically like
this reflect heal blue highlighter and I
figured you know what I'm doing a
greener right smokey why not go ham with
the highlight it's different I don't
give a I'm doing it come on Joris
putting that on the morphe brush that we
used to highlight right area with I'm
just gonna dust it on are highlighted
plans and I felt just use me this really
cool very different kind of highlight
you know like it literally looks like
it's highlighted but it gives you that
nice greenish tone to it can't explain
but I think it looks super freakin cool
I mean of course you guys all have to go
in with a greenish highlight like that's
not normally but you know what I was
thinking when I woke up this morning the
first thought in my head was thug life
don't like what I'm gonna do
yes bitch yeah so now that we have that
nice intense as how they going within
that that fluffy brush really can I just
blend the two together the blush in the
highlight just to kind of really marry
it much better it's very different and I
get I don't give a so I would say
that my face is pretty much time happy
we got into a face thing um let's go
ahead and do one eye now actually now
we're gonna do the brows I'm gonna go to
the brows real quick off-camera because
I think forever and a ton so I'm just
gonna do my brows off-camera and I'll be
back so we have our brows done I'm I was
really trying to go for more of a
natural brow but then start to turn more
and more fleek as we continued so we're
just gonna go with it I'm not going to
come off and do it again oh just go
right into it so let's do the eyes I'm
gonna try to zoom you guys in for the
eyes more because you guys are they're
requesting me to do that so really try
to zoom the shimin I just get nervous
because my face is not perfect okay then
we'll resumed into the eye area I hope
you guys are happy we're gonna go in
with makeup geek beaches and cream on a
sigma e40 that's not go right into our
crease here missing our transition shade
as you guys already saw we had already
primed with um with a concealer from
method which you can go in with that
beaches in crime i should go right into
our crease area don't even be neat put
that bitch in there as are trying what
is that little here I'm going to grab
Manila bean I make it geek as well it's
this little light yeah honey Sigma e30 -
this is the white one from there
ethereal there ethereal lunch
I just want our brow bone it's a matte
light bone white highlight now we're
going to go in with a Sophie 3:45 you
guys know about the brush coming on
would make a geek bitten este akka
that's going to go into our crease area
just really just go right in start
carving the crease and I'm gonna go
right above our crease just a little bit
above it see that then when going with
ie 40 again and really just buff out
that bit in color we don't want it to be
too harsh condition this is why it's so
crucial to have a transition color down
first see how much easier it's blending
out now because we have that transition
okay
and really bring it outwards as well oh
my god my crown I'm cramping
I hope so now that we've done color nice
and blended we're going to go in with
the NYX jumbo pencil in black bean
that's gonna go right on top of our lid
so I'll put like a good amount on the
center and I'll use my finger to really
buff out the rest of it right up to the
crease with this and the farther you go
out the lighter you want to go on the
pressure okay so we have that nice black
sticky base down we're going to go in
with B sugarpill love+ which is this
really dark deep red color and that one
we're gonna grab onto more Fiji 15 this
NEX just flat brush and really just
press onto the black okay and having a
black base down first is going to really
make that blot that red color pops so
much more cute packing it on right up to
bitten okay now that we have that nice
red base down and go in a morphe and
four four three now we're going to
really start to buff out the edges of
the black liner base with bitten okay so
go right into there I'm really focus on
buffing out those corners and edges it's
gonna be a little bit tough to buff out
but we really need to focus on having no
hard lines
keep just keep going and keep working
with the color keep really focusing that
left plus and buffing it outwards now
just go back with the e for teams really
buff out the edges even more and it will
pack on more color if I notice that it's
missing some going a little bit past
that black piece so starting with
something like that
again the key with this look is really
taking that time to buff out those edges
make it look like it's not too harsh so
now we're actually just to give it more
dimension to the eye we're going to go
in with Anasazi eyeshadow called beauty
mark which is like this deep plumbing
purple Brown that's what's go on the
outer corner just kind of really marry
that black with that red go right mm-hmm
really just press it in with little
pencil brush and after you continue to
blend and blend and blend and blend and
blend you should get something like this
I was grabbing a clean brush really
blending out those edges I don't want to
do any harsh lines awesome so let's go
into the bottom part now we're gonna
grab that same NYX black jumbo paint
Clemmie Ling nee we're gonna run that
underneath the eye you don't need to be
view with this out
and then we're gonna grab that same a32
and really just buff out that black
blended out was now I'm going will shoot
another sugarpill shadow in the color
Midori which is this nice green pastel
green color pack that e32 I'm gonna run
that right on top of the black right on
top of them black grab up any clean
brush and dust underneath that to give
you a nice diffuse transition we don't
any hard lines let's just start to look
something like that and then for not a
little cute extra adding we're going to
grab make a geek utopia pigment on the
Sigma T 21 as our inner corner highlight
grab a little bit more if you think it's
necessary yeah okay I'm gonna go finish
other eye off camera real quick and I'll
be right back
both eyes done now think they came up
pretty good yeah I think so everything
looks pretty diffused doesn't it yeah
it's about as blend ease I'm gonna get
it so you only Bend out red so
much okay let's go in Carlisle Ash's
going to use the matte eyelash curler
there give it those extra little bit
mm-hmm we're gonna go in with the better
than sex mascara
that's for the table ryl baby doll
messenger or the bottom okay goes really
tiny and I'd really good again those
little that I can't get
usually oh my god
both of my batteries are little on my
camera and on my laptop trying to speed
through this bitch okay for the lashes
really go in with house of lashes and
nor ferry I've never do so selectors
work on my clients gave me these because
she never used them and she's out there
too dramatic for her so I was like
nothing's too dramatic for a move so
thank you
the lash band of these are thicker than
 turkey legs I don't even know
okay um go ahead and put that little
layer of a duo lash room imagine oh my
god
these ones okay I feel like they're very
thick sore you have to like really moldy
size cuz they ain't gonna be easy to put
on like just feeling I can just feel
that I can oh my god like with my
breath that's how I seem get these
 on by yeah yeah I like these
lashes okay but these lashes are not for
the weak of heart they entail let's do
the other ah the bitch is already
popping up did I not tell you okay stay
down okay let's go ahead and do the
other side I thought I suppose I have
the lashes on I turn like right here I'm
gonna be thin I feel like I turn like
you know I know what that was but that's
why I feel as though I've you my battery
is about add I swear tonight day right
now
no really visit you know hundred boys
are actually my lashes in the air I feel
like my arm tickles within night remote
controls our fan
I feel like House of lashes lectures are
just not for beginners you let them dry
on your face when camera dine I knew I
was gonna die any dead so annoying well
might finish my eyes and the glue is dry
so let me zoom in get in for the eyes
pull it out we have the eyes done and
we're complete with the ice let's do the
lips so we're gonna go in with Mack
boldly bare lip liner and it looks
different right that's different for me
because I is really bold I want to just
go really more natural it c1 playing I'm
gonna fill the whole lip in with a lip
liner
we were lip lined it looks real nice I
wasn't going with buttercup on top and I
feel like I've been using Buttercup a
lot lately it just because it's so
perfect so many one with another lip
color color pop was kind enough to send
me like a bunch of a little lippy sticky
thing so I'm thinking we want to do
something with that let's go ahead
that's so pretty
yeah okay we're gonna go in with button
by color pop their lip be sticky I love
the formulation of Lisa I really do
that lip is giving it to me right now or
