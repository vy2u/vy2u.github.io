favorite products for the month has been
it's just it's just my favorite kind of
video and I love them I love watching
people's favorites videos and I love it
when you guys tell me your guys's
favorites for the month it just makes me
so happy and I feel like we're just like
sharing each other's like little secrets
you know secret little products that
we've been loving so I really like that
as always do like to like this video if
you guys don't like me please don't
 watching don't watch the
face listen if you guys do like this
video anyways do like me please like
this video and subscribe to my channel
if you aren't already I would really
appreciate that click a like there's a
little like button right there just
click it if you liked it yeah without
further ado let's go and get into this
September favorites
cool so as always I always like to start
with skincare if I have any skincare
items - for my favorites I always like
to start with skincare first hmm this
 mask of so good mass per mask
I'm just kidding this is the cup of
coffee or cup of coffee from lush this
is a face and body mask it is such a
gorgeous mask we need to show you guys
what it looks like
it looks like this it's like really ugly
looking like baby diarrhea
basically but it smells like exactly the
coffee has coffee grounds in and so what
it does it's a excited date with a
stimulating a blend of fresh and ground
coffee Kaylin and agave syrup if they
mask that you put on your face for only
five to ten minutes you just leave it on
and when you take it off your entire
like first layer it feels so much better
you just feel so invigorated when you do
it and you just feel like I think it's
cuz like the coffee's and it has like
that caffeine like feeling I mean even
when I just smell coffee beans or coffee
grounds I'm like I'm Kevin Kevin ated
you know what I mean maybe that's just
me but when I smell the caffeine I just
get more like awake and that's what this
mask does not drying on the skin
whatsoever my brother Aaron is actually
obsessed with my mask as well that's why
I don't have a lot of it I won't leave
done it like three times this month so
far and we both are like absolutely
obsessed and I love it it's kind of a
bitch to take off because it kind of
dries on your face kind of weird and
you're like taking it off with the
grounds but it makes your skin feel so
amazing and if you guys can definitely
try out the cup of coffee face and body
mask from lush it is so good I mean all
lush products like I'm obsessed with
lush in general but this one is just
really taking my cakes right now like
and you know taking the cake and my cake
I mean my half yeah next skincare item
and my last concur and I only have two
this month is the fresh sugar advanced
therapy it's the white one you guys
already know that I love the fresh lip
treatment it's the one that's on the
brown tube it's the original it's so
good it's extremely hydrating I
absolutely love that it's moisturizing
it's so smooth on two lips it feels like
butter when it goes on but when I tried
this one oh this just mmm
did me good this is the sugar advanced
therapy so it's gonna be a little bit
more hydrating than the previous lip
treatment literally when it goes on it
feels like water I like to use it once a
day
I have a really weird obsession with lip
treatments unlike lip balm and any kind
of lip stuff like I absolutely love lip
products in general even if they're not
lipsticks or gloss it's like a lip
treatment of any kind I'm like let me
try it
cuz I need to know if it's good or not
and this one really is
surely amazing it's kind of pricey like
not gonna lie I mean and I kind of I
mean it's expensive as but
it really is worth it fresh is honestly
one of my favorite brands like avarice
skincare I think it's so good so
definitely try out the fresh advanced
therapy lip balm if you can I mean it's
too expensive totally I totally
understand like it's expensive
as hell but if you can get it I would
totally try now it's so good my next
item is the Maybelline master conceal
hmm so I first use this in my full face
fall tutorial that's all drugstore so
that was the first time I ever tried
this concealer and ever since then I've
been using this concealer non-stop I
think it's seriously one of the best
concealers for the drugstore ever and
not only is it like okay zhing drugstore
concealer I think it's an amazing
concealer in general it's full coverage
its brightening however the one thing
about it I don't like is that you have
to set it right away or it will crease
on you because it is more of a thick
consistency but it covers up all your
bags covers up all the darkness
underneath your eyes its brightening it
just it's such a good concealer
Maybelline did so well with this and
it's like what like 6 bucks I don't know
how much this is but I like to use this
underneath my eyes as well as like a
little bit on my face if I have any like
imperfections that day which happens all
the time lately if you guys want to get
a good concealer that's at the drugstore
that's not too pricey I would definitely
try out the Maybelline master conceal I
was actually watching Kathleen's videos
and she was the one that used this and
she loved it so I was like I may go try
it out and it is all good thing you can
sleep in for your recommendations there
balm okay cool so let's go and move on
to brushes I have a couple of brushes
that I want to talk about this month you
guys know every single month I talked
about at least one but this time I have
three hmm first I brush I really want to
talk about is the morphe 13 it is this
really cool tapered fluffy brush
basically okay so think of the body of
it as a Mac 217 it has the body of the
Mac 217 it has a pinched ferrule the
same exact length of the 217 it's great
but it's a lot more blendable and it's a
lot more dense so this is more of a
precision blending for me I don't like
to pick up color with this but what I
like to do is place my color down first
and then use this after clean and blend
out the shadows I have on my eyes it is
so good it's so soft it's very
controlled to that's what I like about
it is that it's pinched it's controlled
it's so easy to button up product I've
been loving it for this month I've
actually only ever started using it this
month in general and then once I started
using it like I can't put it down
because it really does blend out
everything for you but it's not product
so nicely it's synthetic it's just so
so good morphe you guys kill it every
single time obviously i have a code with
morphe I'm a morphe affiliate I'm have
more fees Mike one of my favorite Philly
rents to be part of they're absolutely
amazing they take care of the customers
they have high quality products they are
just they're good people they're good my
code is Manny anyway if you guys want to
save 10% on your order online or
in-store if you guys want to I mean it's
it's all good if you guys don't want to
it's all good if you guys are not an
affiliate thing I totally understand but
I mean I truly do love these brushes so
much and if you guys have bought morphe
brushes with my recommendations you know
how much I love them and you know how
good they are so definitely try out the
ether teen and then my other morphe
brush I want talk about is the M 508 I
use this brush religiously I just I just
wanted to talk about it like separately
when I'm doing a tutorial I really talk
about the brushes as much but I want to
break this bad boy down for you guys
what it is it's a very very small
smudging brush so this is great smudging
out gel that's great as somebody got
shadows it's just a great smudgy brush
it's very very tiny it's Dennis but it's
not too dense you know what I mean like
you can definitely blend out with this
bad boy not blend out like like a smoky
eye or anything like doing like
in your crease and this is just
like a small precision about thinking
brushing is just really good at getting
like that like smoked out lashline or if
we run to a smoked out bottom liner it's
just great because it is so tiny and it
can get real up in like by your lash
line just like we like to carve it out
you know this is my favorite brush of
the whole entire month the makeup geek
chiseled cheek brush I talked about it
before on my channel it is seriously the
best contouring brush I've tried of all
the contouring brushes I've ever tried
this one's my favorite it is so so
little soft like it just like look how
easy that glides like it's so
ridiculously soft picks up product
really nicely it's synthetic as well
cruelty free you can go and carve out
what you can even blend out with this
that's what's cool about it is because
it is so soft you can also blend out a
contour with this as well it's just
really cool that it has that ability to
really carve out the cheek not only can
you carve it out but you can blend with
it so I really like that this is
everything that I wanted the NARS needed
to be the NARS either didn't really ever
work for me that's another really
popular contouring brush I definitely
like the NARS either personally but this
one is everything that I wanted from the
eita and more this is funny because like
the bristle link of this brush and the
eda is like almost identical so I'm like
but this one's better though
the next product I talk about are lip
pencils they're called lippy pencils by
color pop I am absolutely obsessed with
the colour-pop lippie pencil I think
they are so good they're so creamy they
glide on like literally like butter
there might need like the urban decay
pencils the way that they glide on so
effortlessly but like they're five
dollars I can't even handle how good
they are I'm gonna one swatch two of
them next to me I'm gonna see like I
like the pencils in general I think
they're absolutely amazing but these two
are the ones that stood out to me this
month specifically right now I'm wearing
poison it's my lip liner that I have
going on right now gorgina and then I
also really really really really like oh
snap which is like a more muted pinky
nude this one meaning about if you guys
are looking for really great inexpensive
lip liners I would definitely try out
the color pop ones I really want to use
some more color pop stuff I want to do
like a more like an affordable tutorial
coming up color pop definitely falls
into the affordable range so let me know
if you guys want to see anything from
colour-pop specifically and I'll try to
make that happen okay
perhaps talk about this because they are
absolutely obscenely good it's the new
Auto saucy bubbly hose illuminators they
are so amazing I'm so beyond impressed
with the these illuminators I've been
using this is the one like this is my
favorite one it's called so Hollywood
it's like a beautiful like golden a
golden gold it's a very beautiful pale
gold shade has like a little bit
champagne to it so cliquish champagne
gold they came out with four of them to
match every skin tone I don't see when I
live Anasazi Bobby Hill's products is
that they really cater to every skin
tone and I think that is such an
important thing when it's a when it
comes to a brand and on a sausage
Beverly Hills knows what they're doing
and they kill it with these different
tones and things like that you know so I
really I really appreciate that with
this Brandon if you're lighting a
function try out starlight and so
Hollywood if you're deeper you can try
Riviera and there's another one that's I
think it's called like peach nectar I
think it's called peach nectar I'm not
quite sure but they're absolutely
amazing and I think there's such a high
quality I'm the only 28 bucks it's just
like it's really they're good they're
really really good and I think should EE
try them out because they have been
killing it I've been using these for the
past couple months but they weren't out
yet so I didn't want to talk about them
you know what it means I felt kind of
guilty but now that they're out I'm like
no screaming from the rooftops bitch
last but not least and maybe my favorite
of the entire month
hmm are the new makeup geek duochrome
line Oh Marlena you have slated me
hardest every day I don't know why I
went to like olden days mode I just want
to talk about the new shadows and the
new pigments from makeup dig the new
duochrome line I want to talk about a
couple shadows that I think are
absolutely amazing and they should be
staples in your collection because I
think they're just great I picked four
of them out of the ones that they
launched these are probably my favorite
for like these are disgustingly good and
my disgustingly good I mean
bombs bug
I'm peach 'less backlight Secret Garden
Karma
those are the four I chose I'm not gonna
swatch them on the back of this hand I
am peach this is this beautiful golden
peach shade it reflects gold and it
reflects peach I am in backlight is
actually really really cool because it
reflects I've already actually used this
in this tutorial purple and teal and
it's just such a cool different like
duochrome shade haven't seen a shade
like that in a while
karma is a really really cool one
because it kind of reflect green as well
as gold it's just like it's just super
cool secret guardian is that really is
my favorite one I think so your
Guardians my favorite of all them it's a
blackened green it's like black and
green combined it was I'm peach list so
if you guys don't see in camera but it's
like a really cool golden peach black
light karma secret garden not only did
they launch amazing shadows but they
launched amazing pigments as well the
pigments are like timez5 they're like
the shadows on crack so what
happens is when you press a pigment into
a shadow it kind of makes everything
mush together and it doesn't give you as
much cool like intense duo chrome effect
so when you have a pigment by itself it
gives you that dome effect so my two
favorite pigments from the lion is
kaleidoscope which is a super amazing
intense it has a lot of different colors
in it so it has purple pink teal and
silver I'm gonna do zoom in for you guys
right now and then my other favorite
sugar rush
oh my god I'm obsessed with sugar rush
like I think it's so pretty good sugar
rush which is this one it's a really
cool intense white that reflect steel
and pink and then there's kaleidoscope
which is more of a silver that reflects
crazy amounts of shades can you even see
that and honestly I just think that
these makeup geek duochrome fake mincer
absolutely I mean you think I think
Marlena did a killer job
with these she just slayed the whole
entire game with these dual Chrome's she
really understands product very very
very well and she's tests products for
so long and she really like gives her
heart and soul into a product and that's
what I love making Peaks so much not
only are the products so amazing but
she's an amazing person and I think that
makeup geek is just one of the best
friends I've ever ever ever ever got to
work with and I just think they're so
freaking cool and I love them so much it
deserves more recognition I feel like
they definitely deserve so much more
recognition even though they have a lot
they have a lot of recognition but I
want them to have more because they're
just so good and yeah that's it that's
it for my entire September favorites I
