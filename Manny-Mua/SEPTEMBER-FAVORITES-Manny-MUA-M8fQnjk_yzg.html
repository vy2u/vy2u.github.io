Selleck today's video is going to be my
September beauty favorites or just
favorites in general because I have
other things that are not just solely
beauty in this video so to me like
September favorites um you guys know
this I love love filming a favorites
video so I'm gonna go ahead and just
jump right into it rather than having a
long-ass intro because I feel like my
intros are always really know this is
what it is
they're always laughing it's crazy
because when this goes up I'll probably
be in LA at the time I'm pre filming
right now because I'm going out of town
when in Texas for the Mac Selena
collection launched Corpus Christi I'm
so excited I'm sure about time this goes
up I'll already be gone from Texas but
if I saw you in Texas I am so happy I
saw you and thank you so much for coming
to see the collection and things like
that I don't really know what's gonna go
on yet but I'm just kind of try to
predict the future here I'm trying to
predict for the future Niner Niner so
let's go ahead and move on to the
September favorites as always if you
guys like this video if you guys don't
like me please don't watch it
you know the drill with that but if you
guys like this video please subscribe to
my channel if you want already and if
you're new what's up um anyway welcome
to my channel thank you so much for
being here
it's going to bond to this favorites
video
okay cool so let's go and start with
these favorite items I'm excited so
let's go ahead start off with the things
that are not beauty related or not as
beauty related as makeup is so first
things first I must start with is this
really pretty diffuser so I have been if
you guys follow me on snapchat you guys
know I've been trying out essential oils
because I do have an anxiety problem
every society issue really trying to
find different more natural ways to cope
with it rather than having to take xanax
and medicine and stuff like that so I'm
trying my best
and Jacqueline recommended to use
essential oils because she uses them and
loves them so I was with her and another
friend and we just like bought a whole
slew of essential oils and so of course
I bought a diffuser with that order and
so this is from Young Living this is the
essential oils a lot Young Living little
diffuser it's like a little egg it
diffuses oils when I whenever I want to
and it's literally just like three
little parts it's so easy to use and it
just basically creates steam and puts
it's not even steam though because it's
not hot so it literally just creates
like smoke it puts into the air and it
just like diffuses the scent I just want
to talk about my favorite oil that's
been helping me a lot it's been lavender
I don't know if you guys like the scent
lavender lavender for me is very very
very calming and soothing and helps me
sleep so what I do is I'll just views
lavender oil and nighttime it helps me
sleep through the night oh being she a
mother bugger check it out I think oh
the next thing is going to be a
foundation I've been really loving this
month I've been really loving it but I'm
also like also having like a love-hate
relationship with this foundation so
it's kind of like a conundrum that I'm
in right now the hourglass vanish
foundation I'm in the shade ivory this
is such a beautiful foundation guys
because it looks so nice on the skin
it's fullfil full coverage gives you a
nice finish to the skin it's not matte
but it's not glowy either it's just a
nice just natural looking foundation but
it's so very very very full coverage so
you can use a small amount of it to give
you a minimum coverage or you can use a
lot of it like a couple more like
strokes with the foundation to give you
a maximum full coverage I'm talking
about full coverage like war it'll cover
up like any discoloration my face any
pimples anything anything going on at
all it will cover it up it's just such a
good foundation but the reason I'm not
loving it at the same time is because it
doesn't have a lot of product in here
it's kind of actually really really
really really annoying it's like a
little stick form as you can see so let
me go and just read off how much it
actually came here so you guys
understand a normal foundation
usually has about one ounce like fluids
usually or like a cream or whatever it
is that usual has a 1 ounce um as a
foundation but this one only has point
to 5 ounces that's literally like
nothing that's no thing
that's why I'm having a love hate with
it because it's expensive as but
it's so beautiful
and it's just like but why is it so like
why is there such a little amount of
product in here why you guys want to try
it a foundation that's really beautiful
on the skin but it's kind of expensive
it doesn't a lot of product
check out the hourglass because let's go
to move on to highlighters now you guys
knew some highlighters we're gonna be in
this video because I have been glowing
this month like right on the first Tyler
you guys know if you guys follow me on
snapchat
if you guys don't man anyway snapchat
right here it's floating in the air
blowing the air many anyway snapchat you
guys know I went to Paris recently with
zoo a the branch away and they did a
really cool launch of a fall products
and one of their products that they
launched were highlighters and they came
out with 3mm rose quartz citrine citrine
so trying Times Citroen am I say
 I miss a Citroen I have been loving
the shade Citroen so much as you can see
it's gotten a lot of love it's like
super janky looking right now it's just
so stunning look at this guys look look
look Oh child let's go and swatch it
this is the type of highlighter that's
like actually blinding as so if you
guys are into the highlighters that are
really intense really glowy and bear
just like pow in your face then you guys
will love the G way highlighters I love
the shade topaz and I love a sage
Citroen Citroen is my favorite one downs
beautiful it's great on a lighter
complexion skin tones topaz is more for
medium skin tones and rose quartz as a
pinkier tone I'm actually wearing topaz
on my cheeks right now but doesn't
suggest if you guys can
oh the consistency it's so weird it's
like the most different consistency is
almost emollient it almost feels wet
it's a powder but it feels wet in a way
it's very hard to explain as a caution
though I have heard from different
people that if you are extremely
extremely dry in my pick up on your dry
patches on the cheeks or on texture or
whatever but hey I have texture I'm a
dude I've never hide the fact that I
have texture so if you guys don't mind
that and if you guys are more on the
normal combination skin side with oily
skin you guys will really really really
love the new joy highlighters used to
code man anyway to save you guys 15% off
from z-wave products if you
down I'm just so you guys know also from
Joey I'm wearing snap dragon lip cream
if you guys are wondering what lipstick
I'm wearing snap dragon by Joey not this
one it's really pretty
chroming purple hi another highlight
that I've been living for is the artist
couture Coco bling highlighter this one
is lighter than Citroen it's a little
bit almost like snow it's insane it's
like a snowy white highlighter it looks
like this as you can see it's like it's
a loose powder and it's a very light I'm
going to show you another extremely
blinding so block like this one's
blinding is both are absolutely
stunning I literally think they're
beautiful has highlighters both of them
I'm like dang like I'm really impressed
I've been highlighting for the guys this
month and what I've been doing it for me
are Citroen and cocoa bling
I'll put Citroen as a base and I put
cocoa bling at the most top tibias
tibias point of my cheeks and it kills
it it literally like breaks mirrors it's
insane it's good let me not
literally brings me here but it's close
so if you guys like beaming ass
highlighters I'll check out Coco bling
and Citroen artis Couture and issue a
toe nice things I have are some lipstick
so I'll talk about one that's more of a
drugstore one and one is more of a
middle ground lipstick not high end but
not drugstore either so first one is a
drugstore one this is the rimmel london
kate lipstick in the shade of 45 you
guys I love these lipsticks I
love them I think they're so beautiful I
wear them all the time I wear them all
the time so this is the shade 45
I wear like half the month
it's a beautiful it's a it's a really
pretty cream finish it but it lasts
pretty well on the lips and they smell
so good I can't even it's like a fruity
scent it's so good it's so good
it's just oh I think it's a couple bucks
it's like what like maybe eight bucks
and that goes with me like when I travel
and next I want to talk about is really
good me because it's so exciting so this
is the Mac Salina lipstick crazy it's
writing crazy that they did this so for
those who don't know Selena is a Latina
artist or she was a Latina artist in the
past and she was murdered
she passed away tragically and she had
created such a beat like amazing songs
and she was really on the rise you know
such a tragedy and not only was she
talented she was beautiful and
kind her legacy still lives on so strong
I'm sure love you guys do know this but
they have a movie of Selena and JLo
played Selena in it and it was just so
amazing I just let a movie but just so
happy that Mac created this collection
with the family of Selena and I want to
talk about this color because it's
beautiful and it's so of my alley
this is in the shade I'm would prohibit
oh and it's just a beautiful new chick
I'm gonna swatch it right next to the
Kate one more brownish warm nude shade
it's so beautiful oh my goodness take a
terracotta nude if you guys like those
colors then this would definitely be up
your alley I'm sure if you're latina or
Latino and you're watching this video
I'm sure you guys are excited about the
Mac Selena collection because it is such
a cool monumental thing that's happening
and congrats to Mac and - congrats to
Selena for making this happen even so
long after she passed so that's amazing
and if you guys can check out some of
the Mac collection that's coming out
soon I'm so excited for them it send me
great I think it's gonna sell out
extremely extremely fast like so fast
but hope that you guys can snag
something just a couple more items on
doing more left so I want talk about
brush really quickly because I do talk
about brushes every single month and I'm
a brush fanatic I want to talk about
this one by morphe this is the are for
teen it's been so good it's just I don't
even I can't even say it's literally the
perfect around a contouring brush that
buffs out at the same time if you guys
want a nice contour brush that's very
tapered and really nice and blends out
very easily and if your face is a little
bit bigger like mine you will really
really like this brush it really fits in
perfectly buffs out perfectly and it's
just a nice little just tapered little
round edge it's like a little nugget I
take a little ball I just want to kiss

so let's cool but I'll definitely check
out the r14 it's really really good like
really good I love it two more items one
is a brow product so my brow session for
this month not what I have on today
because this was the finger
make up challenge and I did want to
touch up the browser to shove everything
else but not the brows I have been using
all month long the benefit precisely at
my brow pencil I you guys know that I
love goof proof I love that pencil it's
a really cool like tapered it's almost
like the Nastasia definer it's like that
cool tapered look but this one I've been
using more oh its cup is done it's
 out them out of it green bow
just absolute amazing because it is so
small and it's so pigmented and it gives
you a really pretty precise lines what I
like to do is I'll use it to create a
bottom shape for my brow and then flick
upwards and just create these nice
natural brow strokes and it's just it's
so good benefit precisely brow pencil
I'm in the shade 6 because I have dark
dark dark black hair Oh definite force
Eisley it's so
goochy goochy good literally I have not
used the goof proof since I started
using precisely because it just been so
easy to create and shape and map out
everything I don't know I just been
loving it so much yeah and last but not
least last but not least this is the
ardency and monster liner in the shade
black this is my favorite eyeliner of
all time of all time it's so
good oh you you Oh Oh Connie good pick
me to this it's just absolutely
amazing Jackie knows not introduces me
to this eyeliner back when I visit her
Wow back
I don't always bring it up but I want to
give credit where credit is due
it's absolutely an amazing eyeliner
because it is very creamy but it lasts
very long but what I like to do is put
it in my waterline and blend it out into
my lashes and blend it with a cab rush
to kind of give me a nice diffused look
and then I will put some shadow table
and make it smoky and it just works so
well but it stays put it doesn't like
bleed into my inner corner bleed out at
the end of my eye and since my eyes are
very watery my liner in my waterline
usually runs and I like clumps up and
it's always just a disaster
it's always such a mess honestly this is
the one that has been the best for me
that has not made my eyes run on the
inner corner and that's a big deal you
know what I'm excited that I hate when
eyeliners run especially they're like it
drives me crazy I just notice
that with me this one lasts the longest
in my waterline and that's what
Jacqueline
Tony and I was like okay let me try it
out sure and really did so identity
suggest this Islander if you guys are
looking for a nice black eyeliner that
will not really transfer and hope or
hopefully wouldn't for you because it
doesn't for me so I can only speak off
of my experience but it doesn't do that
for me
I would doesn't suggest using the
ardency in black super charge liner it's
 amazing it's unreal it's unreal
and that's it guys that is it for my
entire September favorites video if you
