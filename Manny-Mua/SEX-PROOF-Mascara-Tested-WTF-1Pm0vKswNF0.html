it says video is going to be a review
and demo on the new Urban Decay
troublemaker super fat super long sex
proof mascara holy shit
I was dying as soon as I saw this I was
in Bora Bora and I saw this launch and I
was screaming I got so many freaking
tweets asking you guys to review the
mascara like it just in general I just
think it's genius and I live for the
fact that they're like super long super
fat I'm like bitch you're talking about
a fucking it is what it is by the way my
lashes are curled and right now
in case you guys are wondering like why
they look a little more open in a way I
curled them coz they need a fucking real
curl that's we're gonna be doing today
we're going to review it the better than
sex mascara so I just downloaded a
grinder and if I can hit up within the
next five minutes to do a hookup maybe
I'll go hook up with a mascara hon we
shall see okay I don't think I could
really do that but I think I'm gonna do
in order to test the sex proof Ness of
it I'm gonna go like for a run I'm gonna
go up and down my backyard which has
like a trillion fucking steps I'm gonna
start sweating and I'm basically gonna
do like a cardio workout and see how the
mascara holds up and I'll of course I'll
take my phone out there with me and kind
of vlog I thought it'd be kind of fun to
do so because right now I currently
cannot really hook up with anyone I
don't have a boyfriend but I can
definitely that's fine girl I can
fucking do it myself as always if you
guys want this video if you guys do not
like me please don't fuckin watch it you
know the Joey thing but you guys do you
like this video please subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and if
you're new what's up I'm Manning anyway
and welcome to my channel thank ya guys
it's going into this view on this Urban
Decay troublemaker I'm going to read off
what this this mascara is so good it
should be illegal troublemaker mascara
delivers thirteen point seven times the
lash volume and a sexy fluttery
intensely at black fringe ok volumizes
and lengthens as it separates so this
guy is going to be at $24 and it
launches in September and will be
available Sephora Ulta select Macy's
it's for calm and I'm gonna Kate of
course this is what we go right here
super fat super long sex proof mascara
if that's not fuckin talking about some
fucking cock play I don't know what I
I really don't ok that guy you guys the
back of the box ciao maker lashes are
super fat super long and sex proof holds
up in hot and heavy situations we tested
it ourselves it literally says we tested
it ourselves
yaar nasty and everything gay that's
team our wouldn't mind joining honestly
so we're going to test this mascara out
and see what we think I absolutely love
this I love the duochrome to this I love
the fact that it like the plastic itself
is kind of divided and it's like a
different type of plastic it's not
smooth all the way around you guys see
that has like little divots and I like
to dip into that you guys when we're
doing mascara you don't want to pump you
don't want to do this we don't want to
do mm no no no we just go in swirl pull
it out it is what it is pull it out oh
my god this videos full of sexual
tension we're going to test out the
mascara and see what we think we're
gonna do from the bottom
okay I got half of it right there half
of the code have to lashes code right
there okay let's do the rest
so how gonna lie it's kind of scary
using this because some of the bristles
are extremely extremely long and some
are shorter but the long length I'm like
super scared of poking myself in the eye
way so did you cautious and careful with
that so we have one lash on can you see
so this is what it looks like right
there
sadly it's kind of dropping my curl a
little bit I think them formula must be
a little bit heavy but we'll see how it
acts when it's on our eyes for a little
while I'm gonna be fucking we're gonna
add it's on for a minute just let me
know
just letting on though this really
really really does separate your lashes
it does not make them look clumpy
whatsoever this is definitely type of
brush that separates them hardcore look
at the shit separates them very nicely
oh my god I'm living it's a little bit
harder to do on the bottom because of
how long the bristles on the brush are
kind of hard to use okay we have one
layer of mascara on right now this is
what it looks like
one layers on I can definitely let my
lashes look a lot longer they're coated
and they are nicely separated they're
not clumpy whatsoever to me at least so
let's go ahead and apply second layer
and we are gonna test this mascara so
far I actually really really like it I
think the brush is a little bit hard to
use I think it's a little like intense
but other than that I think that they
make my lashes look pretty good I will
say though I feel like my lashes are
dropping the formula must be a little
bit heavier my lashes are starting to
like go downwards again like you can see
I'm looking straight into the camera and
my lashes are basically straight and not
curled whatsoever even though they were
fucking curl this shit okay we're gonna
do one more coat with this Venus flytrap
of a fucking applicator and we're going
to see what it looks like with one more
coat
so as I'm applying the second layer it's
definitely getting clumpy err of course
because it is a second layer getting a
little clumpy err okay so we have two
coats on right now and I definitely
agree with the claims of it is super fat
and they are super long I definitely
agree I think that they definitely mean
my lashes look so so much longer holy
fuck
but for me I just like this not giving
me any lift and volume I need them to
stay curled honestly though I wear
falsies all the fucking time like
literally I don't like normally just
wear mascara and call it a day I wear
falsies all the time but it's really
affecting me too much and I actually
like how it looks it's very very long
and they're very very intense but he
does have a person that really want
to have a nice curl keep it curled like
all day I don't really think this is
gonna be the mascara for you I'm gonna
go do a little bit of cardio right now
and we'll be back soon to see how the
mascara held that what is up you guys
it's Manny anyway back at it again no
just kidding uh this is so so right now
we're gonna go outside and we're gonna
hang out outside we're gonna fucking
sweat we're gonna do some fucking cardio
and we're going to see if this mascara
is sexy time to prove you're not you
know like sexy Titan so we're out here
we out here and we're gonna be doing
these guys this was a doing right there
we're gonna be doing that many times
until I start sweating in here we're
starting with number one come on Zia
let's go up the stairs okay we're gonna
do it and I'm wearing sandals right now
because it's like fuck it I already went
to the gym earlier today I don't know
why I'm doing this day was the wrong day
already when to the gym party did cardio
fuck it's sunny I'll be back soon okay
I'm sweaty officially we're sweating
right now I made it happen
bucks Wes Louie I want are dripping in
my eye
okay guys we are back and I am so
wedding and can you guys tell I'm
sweating this is not highlighter this is
actual real sweat I just did my little
stairs for like like 20 times up and
down here's mascara it's on do that you
see that hmm
I don't know it depends I guess it
depends on house what do you get when
you're having sex I'm full I'm full
sweat look at my chest I'm full fucking
sweating and so maybe if you don't sweat
that much during sex it won't affect you
but I feel like that right there is a
sign that it's not as like it's not as
waterproof as I thought it was gonna be
I thought there's gonna be much more of
a waterproof mascara even though it
doesn't claim waterproof on here who
knows man maybe I need to really have
sex to try it out usually when I'm
having sex I do get sweaty so this is
like a good toast see if I do this okay
okay guys so sorry excuse the sweatiness
excuse a mess that I am right now I'm
gonna take another fucking shower
already showered today but it's another
one so what I think I think that is
definitely lengthening I think it
definitely separates your lashes very
well I do not think that holds a curl
very nicely my lashes were definitely
tilted down the great now there
tilting downwards right now my lashes
they're not like up and fluffy looking
as soon as I blinked with sweat around
my eyes I definitely lost some mascara
on to my face and I will like this and I
white and boom it was mascara so I don't
really know I guess it just depends if
you're super super sweaty person what I
suggest this no I wouldn't or if you're
really really oily I wouldn't suggest it
but it was a nice mascara nonetheless
you know when the eggplants so good that
you're just like so excited that you're
like choking it's so exciting and your
dick tears are coming down your face I'm
not really sure if it's going to be good
for that part you know what I mean so I
don't know guys this is one of those
products ad this is all this is on you
what do you guys think technically will
I wear this again probably not actually
I have other mascaras I like a lot more
it gave me a lot more of a curl but I am
a curl mascara kind of person personally
it's more of a Miss but I think that oh
this will be a hit for a lot of people
for sure so definitely that Urban Decay
did a really cool mascara and I love the
packaging I love the fucking marketing
of it being sex proof I think it's
hilarious and yeah you guys that's ever
taste a video hope you guys enjoyed it
hope you guys enjoyed this uh debauchery
you guys like the little vlog section
that I put in kind of to kind of like a
vlog section I guess if you guys like
that kind of thing where I'm like
testing the product throughout the day
let me know and I can definitely make
that happen more like if I'm testing a
foundation if you guys want to see me
doing like a late night check-in things
like that let me know and I will
definitely make that happen
yeah that's it you guys I'm gonna go
take a shower I feel this guy's thing
