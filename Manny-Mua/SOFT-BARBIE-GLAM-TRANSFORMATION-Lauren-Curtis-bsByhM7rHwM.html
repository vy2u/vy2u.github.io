guest all the way from Down Under
Rojas Fez this is Lauren Curtis and she
is an amazing Australian you jerk if you
don't know she is you should
she's absolutely amazing and she's
visiting in town and like dude let's
glam up let's glam up so I just did her
face I beat her to the ground as
you can see in a makeup way not in a
violent way Reese anyway I'm just
kidding I swear to God but we did her
glad today it's very fresh and not too
intense for those who don't want that
much makeup this is gonna be a great
look I mean it's full coverage as hell
but you know what I'm saying
the no lashes which is a really pretty
dainty look and that's what we did today
on her and I hope you guys like it as
always if you guys don't like this video
you guys don't like me please don't
 watching that's my show every
video you're like what the she's
like gaining followers or brigand chill
I'm like I know but yeah and if you guys
do please like it and subscribe and
subscribe to Lauren's obviously we're
gonna be doing another video on her
channel so check it out and I'll leave
you linked it down below let's get into
this video
hey guys so first things first what
we're gonna do is when we taking the
Urban Decay v6 setting spray as our
primer just a very nice light wash of
hydration just to kind of help with the
next foundation of going in with because
it is a little bit more on the
mattifying side so now I'm going with
the Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation
it's a beautiful full coverage
foundation this is hers personally so
that's why I'm dotting it on directly so
I'm like it's okay this is her face she
uses all the time this is how she does
it and I'm taking one of her brushes as
well this is a buffing brush from Real
Techniques just to kind of help and buff
out this foundation it's a very full
coverage foundation and what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna take a damp Beauty
Blender and I'm going to Pat over the
foundation to really help absorb the
excess that we don't need there because
it is already so full coverage so that's
kind of what we're doing with the Beauty
Blender and giving it more of an
airbrushed flawless finish and also
taking a little bit of a darker shade
down the neck and buffing it out because
I want to make sure that everything
matches with face and neck please God so
now I'm taking a tart shape tape
concealer and it's a really beautiful
full coverage concealer you guys know I
love this so much and I'm taking the
shade light and I'm putting underneath
her eyes and this is great because it's
not too drying at all and it's going to
be nice and crease proof and very
resistant to coming off the face so I
really really love this concealer I'm
just kind of using a Beauty Blender and
patting that in not swiping I'm just
patting to make sure that the coverage
is still there with a damp Beauty
Blender next one you taking the RCM a no
color powder and she loves this powder
so much for a skin type this is great
for people that are more on the normal
to dry side and we're just going to use
it to set underneath the eyes with a
damp Beauty Blender as well as these
smile lines I just noticed that when you
cook the smile lines it helps with
creasing and there's less creasing got
the day when you cook it and let it sit
there for a while and we're just taking
a large brush and lightly pressing it
everywhere else all over the face as
well as the neck to set everything and
then I'm wiping away the excess baked
egde underneath her eyes because it's
been there for a good 5 minutes and
we're pretty good we're set now taking
the Marc Jacobs tantric bronzer and this
morphe r7 brush just to bronze up her
skin is among my favorite bronzers ever
and she has such beautiful cheekbones
already wanted to really help accentuate
them without contouring so I'm just
putting it on the hollows of your cheeks
the hairline as well as underneath the
chin to really just help bronzer
the entire space as a whole so now I'm
going in with the kathleenlights
highlighter palette with makeup geek
this is absolutely amazing and I'm
taking that championship and the pinkish
shade and we're going to be going in
with the morphe fan brush and really
highlighting the face this palette is
absolutely stunning get such a beautiful
pop of highlight as you can see Lauren
is living for it and it's just
absolutely stunning and I'm just putting
it basically everywhere all over her
face on some of our under forehead her
nose and a little bit on the Cupid's bow
and now for the blush I'm taking
Jacqueline Hills champagne pop split and
this is the shade a flower child and I'm
using that to mix in between the
highlight and the bronzer just to really
give a nice beautiful flush of a pinky
glow I'm actually gonna bake underneath
her bronzer to help give us more of a
sharper cleaned appearance because when
you kind of use bronzer it can look a
little bit muddy sometimes so that's
what we're doing we're just kind of
wiping it away after a couple of minutes
and then right when we're done with the
face we're gonna spray it one more time
with the b6 setting spray to help
everything melt in and now we're gonna
be using the anasazi eyebrow definer for
the brows is an amazing brow pencil it's
not too waxy it's not too pigmented it's
just the perfect amount of color and
we're gonna be putting that all over the
brow this is in the shade taupe really
feather that in as well as spoolie it
out when I feel like there's a lot of
product on and just really blend the
product in with the brows and don't mind
if it's messy at all right not because
we're going to be using some concealer
to define it and give it more of a
sharper appearance underneath of the
brow and that's kind of what I'm doing
right now and just making sure
everything looks sharp and defined and
stunning and freaking slaying the
out of it now taking the makeup store
brow gel just gonna lightly set that bad
bitch over the brows because you know we
need to have our brow set or they will
move all over the place and that's not
the goal for this look now for the eyes
I'm taking the Smashbox 24-hour primer
my favorite primer of all time so
amazing for people to have more oily
lids it does not move anywhere
so the first time I'm doing is actually
taking the Marc Jacobs tantric bronzer
one more time and I'm gonna be putting
that into the crease within 150 27 to
have a nice base color it's a very
lightweight bronzy effect and that's
kind of what I was going for and now I'm
gonna go in with the lorac unzipped
palette this beautiful rosy shade and
put that right over the tantric bronzer
to give me a really nice Rose flush she
has blue eyes I really wanted to
accentuate them with a beautiful golden
rose look and I just that would be so
stunning on her so I'm taking that on a
more fatty 27 as well and blending it
right over the tantric bronzer now I'm
taking this darker Mabi tone on a
morpheme 433 and really accentuating the
outer corner it's the same color family
this palette is absolutely amazing very
blendable shadows and that's kind of
what we're doing on the outer corner
right now just really defining the outer
corner without it being too dark just a
nice lightweight definition and then of
course I'm going in with a more 5027
just to blend out all the edges now
taking this really pretty white satin
shade and I'm gonna highlight the brow
bone with it she doesn't really need to
because just amazing amazing brow space
but we decided to highlight the brow
bone anyway and then now for the
beautiful star of the show this is a
really pretty gold lid color it's such a
pretty reflective gold shade it's like
almost like a champagne gold not too
gold but not too champagne either just a
perfect mix of gold oh it looks
nice and now I'm gonna define her lash
line with this really pretty darker
blackened maroon shade and I'm just
gonna take on a little angled brush
she was really filling the liner so I
was like dude that's perfect let's just
go in with some shadow and call it a day
and it just looks really really pretty
and now I'm doing this really cool trick
that Jacqueline taught me this is taking
translucent powder underneath these
shadows to really help clean up b-line
it works very very well I'm just putting
a little bit translucent powder
underneath where the shadow is where I
want to be a little bit more sharp you
just kind of wipe away everything and
you literally have a more sharp defined
line it's actually really really cool
and even know that was a thing until
Jacqueline do down one of her videos and
I was like thank you God so now I'm
taking the same tones I put into the
crease underneath the lower lash line
just of course mix everything together
to make sure everything looks really
beautifully blended and coherent with
the look and then I'm also highlighting
the inner corner with that same white
and satin shade just to really help give
it a pop
and now taking the benefit eyebright
pencil to really help awaken the eye a
little bit more I'm just kind of using
the be Bunner to help put on this pencil
so I'm not using my finger to like pull
her lid down that's not cute at all so
that's what we're doing so now I'm
taking the Clinique chubby lash mascara
and I'm gonna be putting like a generous
coat of mascara on her lashes she does
not need falsies at all she has amazing
amazing lashes so I decided to not go
with falsies on this look because her
lashes you'll see right now are
absolutely amazing she doesn't need them
so I might do good let's forget it look
at that that's amazing so now for the
bottom lash line I'm taking the model
kill mascara this is one of her favorite
mascaras for the bottom lash line from
Australia and then same thing with the
bottom lashes they're absolutely amazing
and I'm like I'm so jealous of your
lashes they're so good and we're just
gonna put some mascara on the bottom
lash line look at her eyes stunning with
no falsies that's crazy so now if it
lives I'm so excited to be using the
Geoffrey start lip ammunition in the
shade X supermodel one of Jeffrey's new
products coming out it's so beautiful
such a creamy satin finish with so much
pigmentation it's beautiful
so so so excited for him to come out
with these they're stunning as you can
see and now just top it all off with
some gloss I'm using the Anastacio gloss
and undressed to really just give a nice
pretty shimmer to the lips and this is
the final look doesn't she look stunning
besides the
and that is it for the entire video guys
