okay so let's go and start on with the
story okay so this is about five years
ago and this is what I was working in
Hillcrest which is the gay area of San
Diego with his gay clubs and there's
things like that that was going on so I
was about 20 years old five years ago
and I was a waiter and one of these
nights one of my friends were like let's
go out let's go to the club and I was
like okay whatever cuz I was 20 and I
really give a fuck and no I was 21
because I wasn't I wasn't going into the
club when I was 20 else 21 so I was 21
sorry 21 years old and my friends are
like Lego let's go out to the club let's
just go hang out it's like you're you
just got off work let's go pop over to
Rich's which is like a gay club here and
so I hopped on over any I friends are
just having a fantastic time I just
super super chill very relaxing we're
just like dancing hanging out went out
to the porch chillin perching doing
whatever the fuck we were doing I was
drinking diet coke and water back then
and I had a P often so in that room so I
was on way to the bathroom at the club
and at this club they have a men's at
number women's but anyone can use any of
the bathrooms it's not like you have to
wait in either of line you can wait for
the girls bathroom or you can wait for
the boys bathroom it doesn't really
matter at this club you can just pee
wherever the fuck you want and the boys
or the girls bathroom so I am waiting
currently in the girls bathroom to have
to go pee I'm waiting and waiting and
the line is pretty fucking long and I'm
like fuck like it's like a bitch like
this line is such a bitch I'm like you
know what it's fine imma do doesn't take
long for me to pee it's fine so then I
was like just waiting and waiting
waiting and then one of my old friends
from work had came out of the stall as
I'm like literally like two away from
the front of the line so I'm like I'm
about to go pee like there's like three
stalls I'm about to go in there's like
only two people in front of me yes it's
fine but a friend walks out and I'm like
oh my god how are you it's been so long
cuz she used to work on my work she came
up to me and she hugged me and I hugged
her back and also coming out it's so
nice to see you we're just hugging but I
heard like chirping in the back like I
heard some people talking back here like
a girl specifically a couple girls
talking behind like maybe like 10 feet
ten people back and I heard this girl
she was like hey stop doing that don't
do that
that's my glittery what she said I was
like there's no exercise me cuz I'm
literally just hugging my friend like
there's literally zero way in fucking
hell she's talking to me saying to stop
hugging my friend so I'm like whatever I
just ignored it and I kept hugging her
and I was talking to her chit-chatting
with her like 101 because I'd seen her
in so long and I was still two people
away so I'm like you know what
to front line I'm not causing a fucking
scene or anything I'm just talking to
her then I hear the girls again
one girl specifically she was like yo
stop chit-chatting stop hugging
duh-de-duh
by nature around so I'm like she's
clearly talking to me at Tehran I'm like
at Tirana Confucians I'm like this
literally no way in hell she's talking
to me no there's no way I'm not doing
anything to her the turn around she
literally goes like this to me she's
like stop hugging your friend and claps
like in my direction and I was like I'm
gonna go here like 21-year old me like
so innocent like a little angel I was
like what the fuck like I've never like
this is never happens before like I've
never been like approached like this or
someone like has never disrespected me

whole life and I was like this is really
weird she does clap to my fans - she was
like ten feet away from you but she's

her and talk to her and I was like in my
mind like fuck are you bitch who the

friend
- like whatever it's fine I just ignore
it I ignored it I turn around and I was
like I was look at my friend and I'm
like do you know her like is this the
joke and she's like no I don't know her
also this is not a joke at this point I
thought it was a joke because I'm like
no like you know her obviously she's
jealous I'm you it's mine she's like no
I don't know who that is
and I'm like I don't know that is either
this is not a joke she's being serious

oh okay got it okay mm-hmm got it now
that I know it's on the joke I'm kind of
like annoyed I'm kind of pissed so then
I mind I'm like you know what I'm gonna
stay by her and I'm gonna hug her and
she's gonna leave and I'm gonna be fine
by the time like this is all done like
I'm at the front of the line now and I
go in to pee and my friends still out

girl from the fucking back row over here
is like you don't stop doing that like
da da da like we have places to be like
saying all these like random fucking
shit that I literally had no idea what
she's talking about and then five
minutes around I was like what the fuck
and I literally say what the fuck and
she's like stop hugging your friend and
this is like literally she's like maybe
five to seven feet away from me now at
this point it's like stop hug your
friend and I'm like and I give like this
weird ass
like okay what the fuck are you kind of
face somebody you know what it's fine
and rocking the concertina like I'm not
gonna cause a scene because I'm fucking
a little angel and never been invited
before and it's a female I'm not gonna
do anything I'm not gonna do anything so
I'm like walking out of the club my
friends behind me I'm like it's fine to
whatever I'm walking out so all of a
sudden the little lesbian girl all of a
sudden she's like yeah you better walk
out of here as I'm like literally like
two feet from her like walking out
because I'm done with the bathroom she's
like yeah you better walk away and you
guys I'll almost lost my fucking mind I
really did so then I'm walking out and
I'm like are you happy and I start
copying back at her because I'm fucking
pissed and I'm like you know what you

I'm a clap but your ass back she's like
two feet if I remind you she's also five

inches tall hold her and I'm looking
down at her like come at me come at me
somebody know what's fine she's talking
to anything she's obviously I can do
anything she's tiny she's five six I can
take her I joined a group so then things
take a turn for the worse forgot I got
fucked on but decides to take it to
another level she I guess so annoying
thing about right now because back then
I was so much nicer than I am now and
that this happened to me now it would
have not had been such a pretty sight
you know
so she lunges upwards grabs my glasses
cuz I I wore prescription glasses back
then I just barely got LASIK maybe like
months like maybe like half a year ago
and I used to have to wear glasses so
she grabs my glasses off my face she
literally grabs my glasses off my face
so then she look like yeah not so tough
now huh with the with my glasses in her
hand and I'm like fuck she breaks him
it's my only pair I'm screwed
I can't drive at nighttime with on the
glasses so I'm just like thinking man II
get your glasses back do not cause a
scene all you need to do is just get
your glasses back be very very calm just
explain to her why you need them back
it's cool you're fine so she cause he's
off my god and I was like gain my fuckin
glasses and I was just very very calm to
be like game my fuckin glasses and then
so she was like are you gonna do now
what do you do now about it I have your
glasses ooh and she's like taunting me
this little five six lesbian is looking
up at me taunting me with my glasses in
her hand and I'm all here just I
supposed to take it and I was like okay
so this is fucking happening right now
in my mind I'm like this is happening so
now I'm like much more in our face I'm
maybe like three inches from her and I'm
like giving my fucking glasses
now and I'm literally looking down her
like piss at this point like my eyes
were just turning red like it was right
on the outsides and I was going in and I
was just going red and I had no idea I
was even going on I was like um like the
devil took control of me for the devil
took control wasn't my body and that's
what was that finally she gives back my
glasses but the way she does it is so
disrespectful I wanted to so all of a
sudden she goes like this to my shirt
she grabs my shirt pulls it taut like
this and she gets my glasses stuffs my
glasses down my shirt and I was like
here you go it's on because I'm so nice
and she's like Pat's my like chest Carla
she was like this like hey go with my
glasses like in my shirt you know when I
was like fuck she might have broke my
glasses cuz she just like hit my chest
my fucking eyes go red you guys my eyes
went fucking red I was live I was livid
you have no idea I was so pissed luckily
one of my friends had saw this
altercation solid girl take off they do
that to my shirt and he came and grabbed
me he was like many the two let's go oh
my god like let's go
I like was moving me the lesson was like
yeah you better walk away after she had
already done to me because my friend was
grab me to go and I look back at her and
I was like you're so fucking lucky here
girls how to beat your fucking ass
straight in her like strain her face she
was like I like looked away it was like
super like hmm like I didn't fuckin do
anything and I was so dead serious guys
like I wanted to literally slap her in
the fucking face and rip off her fucking
fake extensions that she had in her hair
cuz I knew I can see that fuckin track
in her head I wanted to rip it off so
badly but I'm like you know what I'm a
child of God and I'm not gonna do it I
was still seeing black like I didn't
know what I was doing so I'm just like
oh my god this fucking bitch this
fucking crazy bitch and I was like so
upset and I was like no I'm going home
like I don't want to deal with any of
this because I don't drink so like this
is happening to me mind you I don't have
any alcohol in my system and I'm like
just having to deal with this I'm like
you see this shit happens to people that
are drunk and they like get in fights
cuz they're drugged and they're crazy
maybe lesbian was just fucking crazy and
she was drunk who knows but I was sober
handling this and I'm like imagine if I
did drink alcohol she's at the fucking
Newark to drive me like that what I
literally didn't do anything to her
which is why it's so mind-boggling and
even to this day four years later I'm
like you fucking little whore so yeah
guys that was my entire experience with
this crazy-ass fucking lesbian who is
really trying it at the club what would
you have done honestly I'm super curious
would you guys have punched her would
you guys have
out-out would you guys need a friend to
save you what would you guys have done
in my exact situation if you were moved
like would you guys have slapped her
would you guys if I can push it to the
ground what would you have done
looking back at it now I think I did the
right decision by not doing anything
just because she was again she's a five
six woman I was raised to not hit a
woman ever societal norms say you can't
hit women if you're a guy because guys
can be stronger than women sometimes I
didn't do anything at the time but I
feel like you know guys nowadays if
someone disrespects me like that like to
my face and puts their hands on me
because she did put her hands on me you
know what I mean like she put her she
grabbed it off my face stuck my glasses
down my shirt hit my chest like she
definitely touched me and I am in my
full right to hit her back a hundred
percent I could've just slapped her
right across the face if I wanted to and
nowadays would I
oh I don't know it still might be a
little like confidence of like no I'm a
dude but it's like it's not fair you
know what I mean like you're female
a five six female wasn't really bulkier
stronger I think that and you're doing
this to me
thinking and hoping and praying that in
my mind I'm not gonna hit a woman you
know what I mean and the thing is like
this chick she got lucky that was me
what has a different gay boy and he
could have just gone off on her beat her
ass ripped off her hair like because
some gays just they don't give a fuck
they don't give a fuck if you're a woman
they don't care you know I mean because
you're disrespecting them you're hitting
them whatever it is
yeah I'm just curious like what do you
guys think about this like okay it's
like this isn't an intense topic I feel
if you guys are in my shoes won't you
have done male or female in my
experience I didn't do anything my
friend grabbed me before anything could
have really happened she was pushing my
button so hard and she was so
disrespectful and evil to my face and
laughing on my face and hitting me and
I'm like you're so like to this woman
like you're so lucky that I am
respectful of females and if I wasn't
you would have been in trouble because
I'm so much bigger than you I weigh like
a 180 and you were like what hundred ten
like girl it was not smart don't pick a
fight with someone that's literally
twice your size you know but yeah that
was my entire story I know it's fucking
crazy I hope you guys like this video

I've totally done really weird random
shit like I have definitely some stories
up my sleeve if you guys do like these
