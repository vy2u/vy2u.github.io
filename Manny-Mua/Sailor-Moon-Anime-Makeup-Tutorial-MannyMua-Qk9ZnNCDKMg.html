today is going to be a tutorial on this
look I have going on right now I'm so
excited to be doing this video it is a
makeup look inspired by Sailor Moon or
Princess serenity or soggy Sarina
however you want to say it it is
inspired by Sailor Moon I'm not the most
creative person when it comes to doing
Halloween stuff I don't know hundra
special effects I don't have to do body
painting I'm not Mikey I'm not Jordan
Hans I don't know how to do any of that
stuff they are so talented and what they
do and I commend them so much to be able
to do the things that they do but I
can't do that so I can't really promise
like really cool extravagant Halloween
tutorials because I just am not very
good at it and I'm just being honest you
know like I try to do things like that
and it takes it takes me hours and hours
and hours and hours and I'm sure other
people can finish it in like in power
but me it takes me like so long because
I'm such a perfectionist so these are
the things that I can bring you I can
bring you a makeup and tutorial inspired
by Sailor Moon if you're gonna be Sailor
Moon for this Halloween this is such a
perfect look for you guys
Serena aka Sailor Moon she has a lot of
pinks and blues and reds and yellows
going on in her color palette for Sailor
Moon and so that's why I really wanted
to incorporate in this look this look at
me so Taylor that's the best part about
it is that you can do any of this either
Scouts if you want to be Sailor Jupiter
for example do green liner and do
everything else the same like I just
wanted to do a said the mode tutorial on
Sailor Moon is such a close thing to me
but yeah I hope you guys enjoy this look
at so much fun creating this look
honestly it was really great if you guys
have any suggestions to do anything for
Halloween down below leave them of
course I would love to see them yeah if
you guys all liked this kind of it if
you guys don't like me please don't
watch me but you guys do like this video
and you guys do let me please like this
video and subscribe to my channel if you
aren't already and let's go ahead and
get into this Sailor Moon inspired
makeup tutorial I'll punch you okay
great so let's go and start this Sailor
Moon tutorial full face nothing on my
face right now nothing how do you have
primer on that's what's gonna do me now
I actually asked on snapchat if you guys
wanted me to do more full face stuff
because I feel like I've been doing a
lot of it recently and I don't want to
like bore you guys but I love you guys
are like yes like do more full face
stuff Saul's like okay of the whole
thing so I'm gonna go and take V
hangover RX by Too Faced it's a little
primer and I'm gonna put that all over
the face I really like this primer
ourselves like coconut or like pina
colada pool so now for foundation I'm
actually mixing two foundations it's as
such an excessive step you do not need
to do this you can
like whatever foundation is your
favorite your favor foundation use that
one instead but because I'm doing an
anime character that they're like faces
absolutely flawless obviously so I'm
going to be doing like a more full
coverage routine I'm gonna take the Marc
Jacobs one your phone call remarkable
foundation not single in the t-zone and
then take another foundation for the
outside of my face I'm just going to
take shake the mesh first shake it up so
this is like a really cool foundation
because it's a matte finish it's a very
liquidy texture has like a little like
dropper thing I don't know I'm sure you
put it on the back of my hand
a little bit goes a very very very long
way you do not need a lot of this I
promise you
and I recommend using this with a Beauty
Blender not like a buffing brush because
it is really intense I was gonna start
that on the t-zone my face like look at
that like are you kidding and this
foundation stone actually go just all
over the t-zone the areas I get more
oily is where I'm gonna be putting this
look how much this like travels it's so
crazy and it's full coverage like why
good I'm gonna go and take my Dior care
flash foundation isn't my favorite
foundation this isn't going on the rest
of my face honestly this is such an
expensive routine you do not need to do
this but I have them so it's like why
would I not use them you know what I
mean so just go and put that all over
the face I'm putting that on a morphe 6y
I'm doing this because I love the finish
of the DRF lush gives it gives me make a
beautiful like luminous finish I want to
look like flawless for this look Sailor
Moon is a follows bitch so I have to be
close to this bitch I'm avoiding the
t-zone area like I'm wetting my nose and
like this part here because I get oily
with this foundation and I don't want to
accentuate it so I'm just going to avoid
that part now that your face looks
 porcelain because I'm going fast
the thing with full coverage alone so
I'm gonna go take the Urban Decay Naked
skin concealer is my favorite concealer
of the moment and then for like Ohio I'm
obsessed with it I'm in the shade light
neutral I like this one because it's
like a liquidy formula but it's full ass
coverage like it is bomb ID like bomb
diggity I don't know why it's gonna
be hit it's not really working isn't it
blend it up
go ahead and set it real quick I'm
taking the laura mercier secret
brightening powder and a morphe m4 3/8
just to set it I love this brightening
powder it's like a white translucent
powder but it sets my under eyes so
nicely and I don't get like Creasy with
this on whatsoever I mean I do a little
bit because I'm just like I'm a crazy
bitch I just I crease a lot like all so
before I set my foundation I'm gonna go
ahead and highlight a little bit I mean
say the moon anime characters they don't
really have a lot of highlight and
dimension going on on their faces like
just they have like blush and that's
about it because they blush a lot so I'm
gonna go and take the benefit what's up
it's like very gorgeous gorgeous like
golden champagne highlighter and I'm
gonna take that on a more feet 8th place
that on the cheekbones I'm not gonna be
playing a lot I'm gonna be very subtle
with this so I'm just gonna kind of
build it as I go because I want it to be
a nice like glow from within look and I
think it looks so nice huh I love -
what's up I forgot how much I'm like
yeah so now we are done with that part
I'm gonna go ahead and take the
alarmists a translucent powder she's a
little when I got it like as a sample
from Sephora because like when I travel
I don't like to take the big ass one
because it's a hugest hmm you
know I'm so I'm taking this smaller one
put a little bit the cap I'm taking
powder puffs any powder puffs works I'm
just gonna kind of press that over the
skin kind of avoiding the highlight that
I placed out I don't want it to like
didn't initially highlight you know I'm
gonna powder everywhere else the Laura
Mercier translucent powder you guys I've
never used it hard I like more I'm not
kidding it is like the most beautiful
powder
I'm obsessed what this should be called
it a full color change yeah what pours
and what are you have left on the puffs
just kind of barely go over the
highlight face is set good to go I'm
gonna take the makeup forever
pearl finish powder looks like that I'm
gonna take it in the shade 118 on a more
Fiji zero that's going to go on my neck
I'm just gonna go ahead and i kind of
blend my face color in with my neck
because i don't ever like to take the
liquids down my neck i know i talk about
that i talk about it all the time i
don't like taking a good foundation w
neck but powder foundation works i don't
know I just don't like any liquids down
my neck whatever powder foundation you
want to take or whatever liquid
foundation I mean it really doesn't
matter it's just kind of like the method
I like to do and it works for merely
nicely so now my neck matches a little
bit better I don't like to be like my
natural skin color I like to be a little
bit too Hawke
and my character Sailor Moon she does
not do a lot of bronzer like they have a
very flat face other than like blush
since it's more like a modern take like
my take on Sailor Moon makeup I'm gonna
go and take a new brush that I'm
literally obsessed with this is the
morphe and 5 to 7 it looks like this it
kind of reminds me of that Mac one that
just came out that's like really really
popular right now I think it's a do for
it it's like a flat paddle brush you
don't I mean I know like nikkietutorials
and desi Perkins I get rave about the
brush like this from Mac which I totally
understand why like I really wanted to
get that brush but morphe sent me this
one and I'm like the macro and I'm
gonna take this one you know what I mean
and then I'm gonna take a little bit of
hoola bronzer by benefit need i say more
hula it's just like my favorite bronzer
of life and then we're gonna run that on
the temples of my face just kind of like
shrink my face a little bit because I
have a man face so again I'm gonna be
very light with this because I don't
want to put too much product I just want
a very little amount of definition and
who let will get that to me very little
bit on the cheeks not a lot just like
very like like witness I love this
 morphe brush oh my god of the
code with morpheme an emu a all calf
you're gonna save tempers sling it I
mean if you guys want to yeah in case
you guys want to try anything for more
if you have a code with them they're
literally one of my favorite philia to
be part of they're just a good good
brand and I back them 1,000% so now I'm
gonna take a little bit of blush Sarina
blushes all the time she always gets
embarrassed and it's hilarious and it's
amazing and I love anime characters for
that reason like for that blushing
reason I think they're so full so funny
the Too Faced blush in how deep is your
love how fitting is that for me
like really how deep is your love and
I'm going to take a more 53 and this is
like a very pinky blush but again anime
characters have like pink blush like
going on I'm just gonna make a little
apple with my face you know I don't have
a lot of cheekbone whatever on the
apples and kind of keeping it centered
actually keeping the blush definitely
more on the centered side not taking it
so far back like I usually do I usually
take my blush farther back because of
how my face is shaped but I'm going to
keep the blush centered and there we go
for the face we have a nice blush and
just kind of like hmm I'm gonna keep it
as I don't want to do anything more I
want the face to be very just full
coverage blushy not too much to mention
because a lot of inner characters don't
have that much dimension not gonna lie
so let's go ahead and focus on the eyes
now I'm gonna go and fill my brows
off-camera ups and do a little bit of
brow gel just to kind of give me more
fullness to my brow
okay so I'll be right back so for the
eye I'm gonna go ahead and do um the NYX
jumbo pencil in milk I'm just gonna kind
of run that lower the lid and that's
gonna kind of be like my primer good
like a good amount down and then just
take my finger and blend that out so I'm
going to blend that all the way up to
the crease
okay so animaker just have big ass eyes
so what we want to do is you really want
to open the eyes like as much as we
possibly can so that's why I have like a
white on my lid down first because I
wanted to really be open and awakened
white is very opening in awakening you
know I mean likes like highlighting
contouring so what I'm do now is I'm
gonna take a morphe M 520 which is again
on one of their newest brushes from
their new like white-haired line I don't
know what it's called and I'm gonna take
taco by sugarpill which looks like this
it's this color right here and I'm
trying to set the milk jumbo pencil down
I would say the jumbo pencil is like a
very greasy like paint basically I'm
concentrating the most of taco on the
lid and then I'm kind of going upwards
towards my crease but not being as
heavy-handed like I'm just kind of
lightly pressing with that one because I
want to go in with another color
I'm morphe 27 and beaches and cream by
makeup geek of Kohl's and that's when I
kind of go into my lid I don't I want to
have a little bit of dimension going on
right now and I know I have a lot of
light down but I want to blend out the
edges because I feel like it's a little
harsh but the lid is nice and white and
intense and then I'll kind of brush a
little bit of taco on the brow bone as
well just to give me some highlight and
lift to the brow so I'm going to go
ahead and take Barcelona Beach from
makeup geek and that's like a very just
grayish Brown is a very cool tone Brown
on a morphe g29 take a little little
baby like angled brush and I'm gonna
build out my own crease let me just
explain so anime characters they don't
have like you can't see a lid you know
to me you can see the fold of the lid so
we're gonna do is we gonna kind of cheat
the fact that our lid fold is a lot
higher to give us more openness and a
weakness to our lid if that makes any
sense I hope it make sense to you guys
that's kind of weird you're kind of
build our own crease so we're gonna
slightly just kind of build our own
crease
and if it's not as clean as you want it
to be right now it's not for me I'm
gonna take a little bit more of taco on
a more defined brush this is the morphe
be 30 - and I'm kind of carve out at the
bottom of that just kind of giving some
more clean edges with the white can you
see how it's like almost like erasing it
it's kind of cool when you have a really
opaque color like this like it's like
erasing it and now I'm gonna take a
little bit of corrupted by makeup geek
which is a black shadow and I'm take the
same little tiny pencil brush it's a
very little bit amount like I mean I'm
even gonna like I just dotted it and I'm
gonna take a little bit more of
Barcelona
I just want to deepen it slightly I
don't want to deepen it too too much
because I don't want it to be like black
but I want to be definitely deep I'm
starting in the middle feathering
downwards and outwards but now you can
see that I have like this nice like
false upper crease area you know what I
mean um obviously it's not like
natural-looking by any means it's not
it's an enemy character I just wanted to
make a fake that I have like bigger eyes
you know so now what we're gonna do is
go and do the bottom of the eye part
right now I'm gonna take the color pop
cream gel liner they just launched these
very recently I don't know that oh you
have to then shape exit it's a white um
you could totally use that milk pencil
that we use the next one totally fine
guys wanted to be a little more
concentrated with the color and be more
like it's like more delicate this
pencils so much smaller so a little more
delicate and it's a lot easier to
control you know so I'm gonna do is I'm
going to go ahead and put white on the
bottom inner rim of my eye and then I'm
actually going to take that a little bit
farther down I'm really impressed with
these cloud pop like pencils the gel
liners they're pretty good too in the
pot but the the liner is like the actual
like pencils so much and with this set
you can take it as far down as you want
it doesn't matter you can take it super
far down not far down at all really
doesn't matter this is like all up to
you
totally and I'm gonna go ahead and set
it with taco again just to keep
everything in place and make it a little
bit more white as well so now we're
going to go ahead and do the eyeliner
part take the DTLA
color pop gel liner in the pot these
liners are actually kind of drier than I
wanted them to be they're a little more
like drying hard not hard to use they're
not hard to use but they're a little
more drier on the formula side and I
notice like that's kind of Skippy when I
don't want it to be Skippy so so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and take
the dura line by Inglot and kind of mix
it inside with this just to give me a
little bit more creaminess I swear you
guys like the dura line will save
anything
kind of mixing on the back of the cat
with a sigma yo six that's how I used
for my liner threes I'm using DTLA is
because it's a really deep deep deep
dark blue almost black but it's blue and
I really wanted to keep with the theme
of Sailor Moon inspired she does look
there's a lot of white and red in pink
and blue and so I really want to keep it
like inspired by that taking it out
pretty far if you can take it out as far
as you want but it's just as much as I
want to go and then just bringing a ride
back in and I'm going about halfway into
the lid not farther than that just
halfway because I want to use a
different color in the beginning of my
eye here so now that we have like the
outer part of my liner kind of filled in
I'm gonna go and take that same DTLA
color like or whatever deep royal blue
that you have and I'm gonna run that on
the lower part of my lashes just kind of
give me a false lower lash line if that
makes any sense and it's really wrapping
it around the white you mess up or you
feel like you don't it's like the line
is not as clean as you want you can
always go back in with concealer I
probably do that a little bit later but
for now this is totally fine I'm gonna
go and take a different liner I'm going
to be taking beasting by color Papa's
well this is a bright ass like neon II
blue it's really really cool and they
totally reminded me of say the moment I
saw and I was like that's all I'll be
using so I'm gonna take that CTO six
brush same grab the duraline trust me
it's gonna save your life we're
gonna kind of make an ombre liner with
this
okay great so I went ahead and I did the
other eye off of camera so now she looks
something like this you have a nice
big-ass eye going on the look will
really start to come together and show
you put the lashes on lashes on the top
and lashes like on the lash line down
here your fake lash line so I'm gonna go
into the lashes narrow I'm gonna take
the new bouncing style lashes in
Serengeti I've used these in my last
like one of my last tutorials I
absolutely love them I think they're so
beautiful and I think they're great for
this kind of anime doll like look flare
out so nicely in the center and they
just go like right okay I forgot my
tweezers and I'm not gonna get up again
so let's go ahead and pray for the best
putting it on with my fingers I swear
I'm not getting up again I really am not
perfect so we have the top lashes on I
think they look so cool they're like so
spidery and so like full airy I think
they look great with this look so I'm
gonna do now is I'm going to add some
bottom lashes as well I went and I took
some more feet 217 lashes and cut them
in half they're kind of a wispy pair you
can see they're kind of cut in half here
what I do is I'm to put them on the
outer corner of my eye to give me more
like depth and dimension to make it look
like my eyes a lot bigger so I'm gonna
put it on the outer corner of my eyes
directly on to the blue liner part like
so anime I actually put a coat of
mascara on them too just because I want
it to be a little bit darker just to
show up more on like camera or in person
or whatever so now we have the eyes done
I'm gonna go and finish the other parts
of the face we need two more like iconic
e-type things I wanted to do a little
crescent moon on my forehead I went
ahead and I got a piece of paper and
like folded it in half and created like
a little like crescent moon so I'm gonna
do is I'm just going to cut that out and
then like you'll have like a little fold
out like put on your forehead you'll see
right now just just do that okay great
so I went ahead and I cut out my little
moon shape honestly like I don't know
what it is but cutting out a
moon was so much harder than I thought
was gonna be I thought wasn't be easy
like draw a little moon cut it out I'd
be like a crescent no no no no no it was
so much harder than I thought it was
gonna be hopefully you're better at than
me but I kind of suck at cutting out
crescent moons apparently and we're
gonna fill it in with a gold cream okay
gold cream liner I think that Center
than the one that'd be so awkward if it
wasn't centered and I like just failed
it completely and I would like probably
cry or something I don't know I can't
see cuz my fingers are so fat
we're gonna pray hope that's a good okay
and we're just gonna pray because I'm
gonna take the colour-pop cream lie
all right it's the sill that's a gold
one not really no it's called the stick
came off of it what the I'll put it
down below of course but I'm gonna take
that cream liner it's like a very golden
metallic cream liner take a little small
painting type brush like a concealer
brush the morphe m4 to one and I'm gonna
go ahead and paint on that gold hmm okay
so the moon is here it's not just cute I
want it to be so I'm just going to take
the liner and just start doing it myself
 it I'm gonna try to pull Jordan
Hans right now so what I went ahead and
did is I put the cream liner down I
kinda had it freehand it a little bit
could not do it on camera for my life
I'll it had to be too like this close to
the mirror I was like trying to like
outline it just kind of free end it
honestly it's not perfect whatsoever but
it's not that big of a deal I kind of
went over it with like foundation like
around the edges so whatever man you're
just gonna do what you can do and that's
all anyone could ever ask you know doing
your best so last but not least I'm
going to the lips now um I have to use
this for districts were like I mean like
I wanna see like how could I not I'm
gonna be taking draw cosmetics serenity
lipstick which is my collaboration color
it is a beautiful like dusty pink color
it's stunning and it's like so perfect
for this look I mean I named it after
serenity from Sailor Moon so I thought
I'd be so fitting for this you can use a
red lip so you can use a bright pink lip
so you can use any lipstick you want in
that color family because it goes really
well with Sailor moons look but for me
I'm gonna be taking serenity lipsticks
so yeah let's go ahead and fill in the
lips I'm gonna take NYX peekaboo neutral
lip liner and lip line my lips so now
I'm live line in there I need to go so
now I'm gonna take serenity liquid
lipstick by joy husband icing myself I
love this lipstick but I could be a
little bit biased on it and that is the
final look
and that is it that is it for my entire
Sailor Moon inspired makeup tutorial I
