backgrounds a little bit different in
this video because well I just set this
whole shit up it's really brown yeah I
just did like a little DIY thing and I
think I'm pretty pretty cool I really
love me I did like DIY me or manatee
thing I just like search on youtube I
was like okay di vanity with mirrors
first one and I've got so I did and
these are Alex drawers with a linman
linen table thing and if you guys want
me to do like a little bit more in
detail video on Mia that's what we'll do
but this videos not about that
this video is about the tag that I was
tagged in by nikkietutorials oh my doing
me may find it first time yeah so this
is this video is the secrets of a
youtuber tag video when I was tagged by
nikkietutorials who I'm obsessed with
obviously you guys know this already so
shouldn't become a shocker did you guys
thought I want recess with her she's
perfect and yeah so she tagged me in it
and I was like dude I wanna do this shit
let's just tuck the sit down with
chitchat let's Kiki
so let's do the first question how long
have you been on YouTube first question
well I've been on YouTube for a total of
3 months and so I just started I just
started YouTube and I had my Instagram
first though I have a beauty Instagram
if you guys don't know about it it's
many have you a 73 I'll leave it down in
the description if he wasn't using it
but that's how he started it all and I
just had only had it for 3 months that's
about it
at what point do you think you will stop
girl I just fucking started um I have no
idea
we'll see how YouTube goes I don't plan
on stopping yet though so I really want
to get it so far the next question is
the best thing well then this is tough
man the best thing about YouTube we just
get real real with 2 pants right now
obviously a really real um I think the
best thing about YouTube I'll probably
have to say the influence of YouTube
that has had on my life that's probably
one of the best things the influence I'm
giving to others I get a lot of emails
and a lot of comments things like that
sing like how I have helped other people
in some sort of way and I think that's
probably my favorite part about YouTube
is that not only are you helping other
people being who they are and helping
them like just do their own thing but I
also what I love about is that you can
make a career off of youtube now um I'm
working so hard to make my channel like
something better than a lot of ale and
it's it's tough though it's really tough
and yeah that's why I think the best
thing is is that you can influence
others and your life is influenced as
well influence is a huge thing with
YouTube so I really like that um the
worst thing mmm the worst thing I'll
have to say is editing
I'm such a bad editor you guys you guys
have seen my videos it's like like cut
kakaka cook like barely barely adding a
transition stuff like that I'm just not
good at editing that's why the worst
part and then the next worst part is
growing a channel growing your channel
is really hard like man I don't know how
to get peeps to like freakin view your
shit that is dumb that's the hardest
thing I would say is probably mmm
editing is the worst but then the second
worst is getting people to watch
I was really honored email again um how
many thumbnail options do you usually
take um I usually take like 10 honestly
a lot of people are like oh my god I
take so many pictures for my thumbnails
I take like 50 I take a like a hundred
but I'm like dude like I've the
viewfinder reviewing me so I know
exactly what I want to look like like
right then and there so I'm just like
you shall go to my poses first I'll do
the money I'll do mine hmmm that one and
I'll do like the link hand the hand the
hand thing so I just I go to a bunch
alone but maybe doing 10 10 on average
well okay emails I'm guessing emails a
lot on my youtube crush I would say boy
Joey Graceffa because me and him need
huh maybe um and a lot of people are
like dude he's straight
dude he's gay I honestly honest to god I
think he's gay
um I've seen his most recent videos he's
quicker than me and that owl and I'm
sitting cross-legged on like I have a Q
I would say girl there's too many
there's too many girl crushes I have so
many like straight girl crushes on
people right now I have like crispy of
course I have Jacqueline Hill I have
desi makeup I have Shannon ik so
nikkietutorials is one of my crushes
tool like I just I love a lot of these
females who's on your collab list well
being that I haven't really come around
I had maybe one collab on my channel
everyone is not my collab list because I
don't have anyone to kill have one but
um yeah I would say I'm like collab list
people that are really good editing like
I would love to collab with like Nicki
she didn't have summers in a club with
clay no she turned her fucking editing
shit out and I'm a good idea all the big
I mean I don't see like all the bigger
youtuber like Beauty people would be
amazing like Wayne goth obviously I
would love to collab with him because
he's he's fine so
um yeah any of the bigger Beauty people
I would love to collab with them Alex
faction Patrick Starr
yeah those people you know what are you
wearing on your bottom half I'm wearing
black pants which is I mean I knew I was
doing this tag and I was running here
and today so I'm wearing black pants but
you guys sometimes I'm wearing just
underwear like I don't even fucking care
excited have a shirt on the top and I'll
be wearing like gym shorts or I'll be
wearing like literally like tiny ass
fucking little brief underwear because
you're working you're not going to see
the bottom hat you know what it means to
want to play and have any pants on I'm
just thinking how long until you
actually click recording today took me a
while because I was trying to figure out
like some angles like so you can see my
little soft box right here one of them
like that part is really hard like you
have to do a whole double set up shit so
it something like 15 minutes today and I
had to put like makeup on so I'm wearing
like foundation and like lipstick and
song but um usually like you ju-jee like
what I was doing money setup before okay
so my setup before you guys I was
sitting on the floor like the whole time
I'm sitting I was literally sitting
before like my ass was to the carpet and
I which is recording against my wall
that was my setup I don't know I wasn't
even sitting in the chair or anything
like I was on the floor the entire time
so this is a lot better but um yeah I
takes about 15 15 or 20 minutes bro
yeah how do you feel about the YouTube
community and culture um well I just
started I love it so far I really I
really do love it it's so it's great the
YouTube community is amazing and people
are so so so amazing don't get me wrong
I've encountered my drama and I've
encountered my like bullshit with
YouTube community or like the YouTube
people which I'm not going to get into
at all but um for the most part like 90%
of time it is amazing and everyone is so
supportive each other and that's what
all I want like I want everyone to be
supportive of one another and if I'm
succeeding I want you to be succeeding
and if you're succeeding what you'd want
me to succeed let me fuck with him well
yeah I loved it for the most part
community is amazing I just started it
so I'm still learning a lot about the
YouTube world in general but for the
most part I
they like it what's your secret to a
successful channel I'll let you know
when I get damaged because I'm not
successful yet um no honestly I don't
really know I don't have a successful
channel yet I don't have that many
subscribers yet I have maybe I think I
have like by the hundreds we'll go about
how we have like 15,000 subscribers so
I'm like I'd mine for three months and I
have to think thousand subscribers so
what I'm going to say I know I don't
have a successful channel yet but what
I'm gonna say and this is what I think
that you guys need to really like just
listen to is just beat yourself this is
like one of my biggest like things and
like I know it sounds weird the YouTube
like the viewers you guys will see
through the bullshit you'll know if I'm
being serious or I'm not you know what I
mean like and people will just
automatically they will know if your
ebook oh well more people will
automatically know if you're
bullshitting them so that's like one of
the biggest things is just to make sure
that you you're just being yourself
you're coming across genuine and you're
not faking it like I watched so many
videos and you can just tell they're
faking their personality just to get by
and just to be kind of funny and just
like dude it's not that serious wrong
and it just it's fake you don't mean
it's fake you can tell that they're
being fucking like weird and stuff like
that and all I'm saying if you're even
if you're not growing a channel and even
if you don't have YouTube and you're
just watching this just with your real
life world just be yourself
yeah so I think that that's what I think
is important is that you're being
yourself with your channel you're not
faking it you're not faking it just so
try to get more like subscribers like
it's not about that it's just about
being yourself people see through people
will see through your being fake so do
yourself that's like Matt's my secret to
a successful life is just being yourself
I don't have a successful channel to get
I do believe in myself and do believe
that my channel will grow because I'm
not I'm not faking this shit with you
guys I'm just like this random dude
doing makeup like how fake can I be with
fucking putting on lashes the things I
do the mannerisms I have the things like
that I would live like this with my
friends so I would hope that that is
translated through you know what I mean
so yeah a lot of people can see through
the bullshit so don't bullshit the
viewers and your guys's channel will
crown another great thing to would be
nice lighting
nice background and nice audio I don't
have a
we know what the audio thing I don't
really know what I'm doing yet I'm
talking into the camera the camera has a
little audio thing plugged in I don't
have like a fucking audio jack or things
like that so I'm just like hopefully the
vid the audio isn't too bad because how
have shit yet
wish me luck on the audio part you can
have beautiful videos you got beautiful
audio you're not beautiful everything
but if you're a dumbass and you can't
fucking relate to the audience that
what's the point what's the point
we're gonna watch you and then turn it
off they're not going to comment they're
not gonna like they're just gonna beat
your shit just to get knowledge but like
what you want to have a viewing that is
engaged with you and followers that
really care about you and love you like
that's what I want want you guys to
relate with me or what you guys to like
just shit around with me on with you
guys just like have fun while watching
my channel cuz I'm having fun making
these videos for you guys and I want you
