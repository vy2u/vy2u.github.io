today's video is going to be a fun one
I'm actually very very excited about
doing this so what I decided to do is go
to Sephora and I went and I checked out
literally every single brand and I went
through every single nook and cranny of
the store to check out which holiday
deals were the best ones best for the
money and best products I think that
would actually be really really really
great for you guys to invest your money
in or give for a gift and when I talked
about this idea a lot of you guys were
like fuck yeah hell yeah I do this is
such a great idea so I'm really really
excited this video does go over well can
definitely do one for Ulta as well how'd
you guys did ask me to do one for ol
tuck I did drop like literally like five
to six hundred bucks on these items I
want to make sure that you guys are
actually enjoying the video before I do
it again PS I don't know if you guys
have noticed boom she's got a tattoo
she's a little shaky she's got a tattoo
think you haven't tattoo again for this
tattoo definitely I don't know which
videos are we going up first this one or
the one I just found before this so
tattoo is right here just in case you
guys that just gazes and goes at first
don't know yet so that's what today's
video is going to be you guys I'm going
to be doing this really cool holiday
gift kind I think or I don't know what
exactly I'm gonna call it many more so
like holiday deals that are actually
worth the money I really know exactly
I'm gonna title this video yet but it's
going to be something involving of
course all these items that's it I think
that's all we have to say it's going to
film I miss a motherfucker so I went
into the store and I bought a lot of
shit and I think these are actually
really really cool items I think you
guys would actually really really really
enjoy as always if you guys like this
video if you guys do not like me please
no fucking watch it you know the drill
with that you know the fucking joke that
don't watching fucking like it what if
you guys that do like the video please
go ahead and give it a thumbs up and
subscribe to my channel if you're not
already and if we knew what's up at man
um you a and welcome to my channel thank
you so much for being here I really
appreciate it thank you for uh joining
the maniac fam thank you
and like yeah love you guys I'm
literally getting stronger cuz I go to
the gym more I'm sorry when I'm hotter
and when I'm skinnier I'm more cunt then
I'll do some fucking service let's just
go and get into this video right now
okay guys so let's go ahead and start on
the first item of holiday stuff that I
think is actually really really cool and
worth being Monte so first things first
we have this this is the Sephora
favorites
give me more lip this guy retails for
$68 I bought this for $68 the value is
two hundred and fifty four dollars so
every single year Sephora does things
like this they come out with these
little lip kits or it's like a
highlighter kit or an eye liner kit her
mascara kit things like that I only
bought one because I just wanted to talk
about the fact that they do have kits
and all of them are a great deal but the
one that I noticed this year that was
the best deal is the lip product kit the
difference between this one fuck you
actually save a lot of money on this one
so the difference is 186 dollars I
actually did the math for all of them in
the store and this one was the best deal
for the entire Sephora favorites you get
five full-size lip products and then you
get one two three four five six seven
eight nine nine mini so definitely
getting 14 lip products here you get an
honest hacia gloss bubbly brown lip
lacquer dior hourglass huda beauty Marc
Jacobs Tarte Laura Mercier smashbox
Sephora collection you get tons of
different things this is it right here
you guys get a ton and if you guys are
more of a beginner into the makeup realm
and you guys wanted to try some multiple
things i would suggest getting something
like this if you guys wanted to dabble
in wearing makeup and wearing some
lipsticks and just trying out different
lip products that you might like
yourselves i would definitely suggest
the lip kit of all the kids that i saw
this was the best deal so a second
little guy that i picked up were these
guys right here these are from Stila i'm
a huge fan of the glitter and glow
shadows the glitter eyeshadows that they
came out with and these are a pack of a
six of them this retails for $45 and the
value is $72 I really just wanted to
talk about this really quickly because I
just feel like this is a really really
good deal when it comes to using the
glitter at magnificent shadows so it
comes with three glitter and glow
shadows which I'm actually wearing right
now I'm wearing one of the glittering
glow shadows right now and the other
side are the shimmer and glow this is
absolutely nude I had no idea first of
all this is something I got home I
realized I said new shimmer and glow I
thought there were all the glitter and
glow shadow so that was kind of
intriguing to me I was like wait I
thought these were all the glitter
shades so each of these you guys get
2.25 milliliters and honestly for an
eyeshadow like it you don't need
that much so I'm actually going to go in
swatch the shade kitten which is a
shimmer and glow shadow I don't know
what this is I did not know they came
out with these this is something that's
new to me but as you can see right there
this is a shimmering glow it's gonna be
a shimmery base for that show wow that's
fucking nice whoo child and it's going
to swatch a glitter one as well just I
guess let's see let's go on swatch these
right here this is in the shade
smoldering satin right there so we get a
shimmer and you get a glitter so if you
guys are the type of people that really
enjoy glittery shades or something
really bright and luminous onto the
eyelid I think you guys would really
really enjoy this set also you guys have
been wanting to try out the Stila
glitters but they're actually kind of
expensive for one of them alone for one
normal sized one like this it's $24 so I
thought had value of you get six minis
for 45 so I thought that was a really
really good deal personally and I really
do enjoy these shadows a lot so I would
definitely suggest checking out the
Stila eye for elegance kit of course the
armies of course but hey let's go and
talk about another item we got these
this is the Tarte high-performance
Naturals
blush Bazaar Amazon clay blush palette
so this guy I bought it for $44 and it
retails for one hundred and fifty
dollars so you are saving 806 bucks when
you buy this this is the last one I was
so happy I bought a house shook I was
like please please let there be one more
and this was the last one it was like
thank you Jesus so this is what this guy
looks like right here
this is an entire blush palette it's a
blush palette so the reason I wanted to
include this in the best buys of the
holiday season is because one it's only
$44 which of course is a lot of money
don't get me wrong it's a lot of money
but with the value of being 150 I think
I was like whoa the value of that was
absolutely amazing and guys tarts
blushes are some of my favorite blushes
of the entire beauty industry I think
they're absolutely amazing I'm actually
wearing one right now they just last so
long on the face it's ridiculous and
they're so smooth and they're so creamy
animaux just like I just honestly really
truly love them and I really do enjoy
that they have a nice variety of colors
in here they have some that are a little
bit deeper and complained so a little
bit deeper ones here which would be
great on darker complexions they have
some lighter ones they have some corals
there's some pinks they have some mods
they actually have this highlighter I
think
we got a highlighter we got two
highlighters I'm actually not the
biggest biggest fan of tar highlighters
it's not something that like tart like
my first thought is not highlighters my
first thought is like blushes and
complexion products so I really really
really do enjoy this I think this is an
amazing amazing value in an amazing
amazing kit you get ten it's a big
fuckin thing look at my face look at my
man face fucking Pac Man up in this
bitch so next item guys that I thought
was a really really good value for what
it was is this by Kat Von D these are
the everlasting liquid lipsticks this is
the mini liquid lipsticks set it comes
with one two three four five six seven
eight eight lipsticks and it retails for
$49 I think that that was a really
really good deal I'm not exactly sure if
this is for holiday or not because it
does not say what the retail of value
itself is but I thought you know what
this is actually a really really good
deal Kat Von D has some really nice
liquid lipsticks and it comes with a
great variety of shades as you can see
here that comes with like the black one
a brown some nice cool toned Jade some
nude some warmer shades you get some
like cranberries some Mahdi's up in here
let's go ahead and swatch a couple of
them this isn't the shade of sanctuary I
think these are just shades that are
really really popular from Kat Von D
each one of these guys is point 10 fluid
ounces I'm gonna go and swatch sanctuary
who's kind of swatching a little streaky
but hey it is what it is it's right
there like every other thing too worried
it's going to swatch this one Hawkwind
woo Hawkwind I like that beautiful shade
that one's less tricky then sanctuary
was right there beautiful shades I
honestly think that Chi Bundy has such a
nice variety of shades in her cult in
her makeup line so that's why I wanted
to talk about this really quickly and of
course it is just a good deal 49 bucks
you get a liquid lipsticks they are mini
but it's just a good deal if you guys
wanted to get into liquid lipsticks or
using capital D liquid lipsticks or just
liquid lipsticks in general for a nine
bucks eight liquid lipsticks that's the
win for me that's a fuckin win so next I
wanna talk about really quickly is
another thing that they do every single
year and I don't know if you guys know
about this but the four does this every
goddamn year which is a great fucking
deal this is the Sephora favorites
perfume sampler so I guess I technically
did have to Sephora favorites so I
bought this for $65 and a retails for
119 that's the retail value of it
basically what it is you
sample all these different types of
scents and the scent that you like the
most I think you go back and you return
like your little slip that's inside of
it and they will give you the
medium-sized of this fragrance for free
because you technically bought this so
this is a really really good gift or
just a good I don't figure self you want
to just try out different sands and
you're like oh I don't know what kind of
something I want to try it have some
really really nice cents in here that
was sold it very very well when I worked
at Sephora 17 samples 17 yeah this has
been going on since I worked at Sephora
so it's been going on for years and
years and years and it does well every
single year and they have another one
for men as well
I've seen this is a great gift to give
someone so I really want to bring it up
to you guys in Baguio this sampler is
absolutely amazing these items I bought
here are when I went into the store in
Sephora and bought them I'm sure they
have so many more different gift sets
online but I didn't buy these online I
bought these in the source of your way
into a Sephora store you should probably
see all these items there and this is
where I thought like wow
these are really really cool sets good
cool gift ideas that people would
actually really enjoy okay guys we're
down to the last one we're down to the
last one we got this guy right here so
the last item here is by touch insole
these are the metallic liquid foil
glitters another glitter eye product
that I absolutely love comes with six
okay guys so this retails for $40 and it
is a $60 value so it is a little bit
less of a value than the Stila one you
guys only save twenty bucks on this guy
but again it is a savings we're saving
money and so guys how these work it's
kind of like hard to explain so how
these work you guys use the little
liquid that it comes with first and then
you apply be like glitter flaky part on
top of it to give you a really really
intense foiled metallic ass shit that's
absolutely beautiful I'm actually gonna
do it on my arm right now let's do this
really pretty golden so we have the
liquid right here use the liquid side
and you go in and apply the liquid on
your hand or on your I what the fuck on
your hand
I mean I'm applying on me and fucking
blinding fall okay play that let it kind
of like soak up so once it's starting to
get a little more dry I like to kind of
smooth it out with my hand it's gonna be
easier on the eye if you smooth out with
your finger I just feel like it's easier
and then I'm gonna go ahead and apply
the more flaky part and this guy it
comes out like a weird little paddle I'm
not the biggest fan of the panel but
what you want to do is you want to apply
it
on the shimmer and just pack it on oh
definitely again with this one I would
actually suggest putting it on to like a
on your hand the back of your hand and
then like packing it with that because
this is kind of a bitch to apply in this
little area right there you see a little
more of a white it's so blinding it's
hard to see right there so you can see
right there this is the one that has the
more glittery intense flakes this side
is the one that does knock the camera
can't even figure it out with that
blinding okay guys so basically it's
very similar to the Stila eyeshadows but
it is a two in one type of process and
it really intensifies the shades so much
and it sets the cream underneath it so
they last a really really nice amount of
time on the eye and you just get a
really really fucking cool ass effect
and it's just sickening and in hits so I
thought this would be really cold you I
had no idea that they had this for
holiday and I think it's really smart
for touching soul to do this I feel like
this is like one of their best parties
ever created was the metallic liquid
foil glitter product that they came out
with so coming up with one that comes
with six okay guys and that is it for my
entire little gift guide for this season
I just saw a bunch of these random items
something you know what that looks like
a really good set and I've these a lot
of the items I have tried myself
personally so I'm like you know what
this would be a really great value for
someone that has more of a beginner or
someone that's wanting to find really
good gifts to give someone that just
didn't really know like the way around
the gift set or something like that I
hope you guys enjoyed it have a lot of
fun of filming this video if you guys if
you guys want to see me do one of these
for all tuks I can tell you make that
happen I'm not really sure exactly what
type of gift sets that they haven't also
if they have ones that are similar or
the same then maybe I won't I can
definitely do if you guys want to see it
if you guys like this video I can tell
you make it happen for you guys other
than that that's it I'm gonna go off and
play with zaiah and just go hang out and
get some food I'm kind of fuckin hangry
