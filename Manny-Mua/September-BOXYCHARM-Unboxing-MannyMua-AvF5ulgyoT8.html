wait let's get into this unboxing I feel
like that intro is gonna be so
long holy
comes along and I can feel it in my
bones
come on little box and I got my little
scissors it's a little crane it's
 cute so let's go into some
bosses bitch I are having a box again
Rinku unbox it open the thing okay sir
as you can see if that's right yeah yeah
okay so this is runway why can I see
runway runway runway runway
so it says runway ret runway ready
I cannot say runway we're ready in the
same sentence that quickly run me ready
runway ready hmm and this is the
September 2015 collection of the charm
we're so cute and so it has like
all the things on the back of it I think
I'll read them off but I'm gonna just
get things fast first thing I looked at
in the boxes beneath this is a smolder
eyes by Tarte it's an Amazonian clay
waterproof liner it looks like that the
only thing it's like a little just gel
liner thing I think oh that's pretty
it's like a little gold and bronze it
looks like a bronze and gold but I
actually have a couple of these I'd
never actually tried them though
yeah I should probably using them cool
great I'll try it next one is the
provides skin type one through six
hydration with potent antioxidant
botanicals hydro milk contains both
knowledge and again hydration with
potent antioxidant botanicals Hydra milk
contains active levels of natural
ingredients to help improve skin
hydration and fight free radicals when
are you you bitch Hydra milk
what is that anyway I think it's a
moisturizer
I think the moisturizer provide skin
type I'm just gonna squeeze a little bit
on the back of my hand looks like that
two fluid ounces that's a fuckton okay
so the consistency is very watery it's a
very watery feels very nice smells like
a spa
it smells fun good I like that I
like that I'm gonna now protect some
free radicals that I'm already like game
game like game over yes I'm all about
free radical protection next we got the
cella eyebrow defining gel a little
wrapping of it and this is a clear brown
daub I tried to brothels before and I
really liked the chilla brow pencils so
I'm hoping that these are gonna be just
as good I'm all about clear brow gels I
think brow gel is super important I used
to do the whole like fleek brow and
filling him in with like brow pomade
then stuff like that but now I just do
brow gel usually I use colored but clear
brow gel on things they don't wear
makeup is like essential for me
so brow gel it is okay so we have a
Vasanti brush of a Santi face brush the
average foundation powder brush it's
just the bristles aren't my favor
there's a liver but you know what it's
still a brush that's a face brush you
can use moisturizer primer or anything
with a face brush I mean it's a flat
paddle brush the ferrule and the body
feels is really really really nice
actually though like it feels very well
made I just don't like the bristle type
I just feel like the bristles aren't
soft enough maybe if I wash it it'll be
softer I just like the way the bristles
feel that's just personal preference
that's just not my style I'm really used
to the morphe brushes and I really like
their material a lot more like it's very
very soft and synthetic so I really like
the way those feel but you know what it
is a face brush and like a $22 little
box like that is bomb as like
really it's good okay so this is last
thing these are scratch limited edition
and nail what the are you nail
wraps I don't know what to nail or
appease so I'm assuming what this is
it's like a little like press on the old
thing they're like little stickers for
your nails which is really cool oh my
god that's differently zoom it's is it
focusing I'm assuming it's like lower
Neal tattoos like you like it and press
on to the nail and it's good to go I
honestly like for me for a boy being a
boy and I don't paint my nails or
anything like that this would be such a
cool thing to do like if I wanted to
just get a little something someone on
these nails on these cracked as nasty as
 nails cuz I have nasty nails
honestly I know sup look at the awesome
 awesome this is actually the
last thing oh my god so this is from
Kardashian beauty the Kardashians like
Kim Kardashian uh-huh so this is the
Kardashian beauty blackseed dry oil
apply small amount into your hands and
distribute evenly into hair is just like
a dry oil for the hair like you just put
it in your hair you can style it things
like that just an oil I'm not really
sure exactly I don't really use oils in
my hair yeah I just don't do always my
hair so I'm not really sure about this
thing but I'll definitely try it out at
least once I want to try it I mean it's
from Kardashian so I'm kind of curious
because I never actually tried any of
the Kardashian's stuff so I'm like fine
just about yeah so let me just go ahead
and read off the prices of everything
because that's obviously a huge
important part like how much does
everything work so the first thing is
the provides skin care hydro milk
hydrating lotion its full-size and it is
$48 for this bitch it's 48:48 what the
 you think you are provides so it's
$48 this is super super super expensive
excited to try that out like hell yes
okay so that's that Asante professional
foundation brush this is full-size and
it retails for $32 you are not there
were 32 you or you're not
ordering - I like the shape of it don't
get me wrong I like the shape of it I
like the Pharaoh I like the body it
feels very well managed don't like the
bristle
type of bristle you know what I mean
it's just personal preference you guys
could be loving and living for the
bristle but it's just not my thing so
mine it's the only thing that does these
tarts Mulder eyes Amazonian clay
waterproof liner full size 22 I knew it
I knew it
so the boxycharm box is 22 bucks and
this alone is 22 so that's pretty like
gnarls barkley that's really crazy oh my
god I'm like really really it's
pleasantly surprised honestly like I'm
obsessed with tart I left our I think
tart is so freakin good next Chella
eyebrow defining gel full size of Kools
and it is $18 of full-sized cello brown
gel for 18 bucks that is expensive it's
freaking hail next one is the scratch
nail wraps full-size of course and it's
$12 for the scratch nail wraps this is
12 bucks which I could totally expect
I'm assuming like most things like this
like nail like press-on type things are
expensive it's for convenience too and
they're really cute so totally like
totally worth it the Kardashian beauty
drive sea oil is a travel size that's
not just a bonus item it's not um in
here for like price-wise it's just a
little bonus they're all like travel
sized dry oil you know what is this
worth total oh my god I'm really curious
let me just add up everything on my
phone because I can't do the math in my
head too lazy I'm too lazy
a hundred and thirty to eat old hers so
the total price of this entire box like
retail wise is one hundred thirty-two
dollars and you only spend $20 the
reason I'm even doing this Bucky charm
unboxing video is because boxy charm is
my favorite box service of every box
service I've ever seen or received
I think boxy charm is the best the fact
that you're getting full-size items most
of the time you're getting full size I
don't know man I just think it's really
really really really good and I think
that boxy charm really takes so much
time to make the best box that can
possibly make especially like fur the
price you're paying $22 and the value
was 132 for example in just September's
box so I think that's really crazy
honestly I think that's really great and
that's why I wanted to do this and yeah
that's it for the entire box that's my
September boxycharm box I just did an
unboxing for it I hope you guys liked it
let me know if you guys liked this kind
of video if you guys want me to do
monthly inbox scenes I can totally do
monthly unboxings or if you guys want to
see me do specific things with the
products in it let me know that as well
you know I can try to do like some more
swatches or I can do some stuff on my
face if you guys want to see that you
know what I mean so let me know you guys
started this video if you--if I did ok
and my first boxycharm unboxing I don't
use like I would really love your
feedback especially if I'm gonna be
doing this more if you guys like me
doing a box of Charminar box things let
me know like this video and I will do
more every month I'll do one might as
