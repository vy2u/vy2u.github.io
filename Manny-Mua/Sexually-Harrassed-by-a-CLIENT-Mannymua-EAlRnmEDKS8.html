gonna kind of take a long time I can
just feel like it's gonna take a long
time for this video this is when I was
working in Sephora and this was about
like a couple months ago and so let's
just start to story I'm at work it's
like three of us there and there's this
guy that comes in and he's like six four

crying that's already a fucking crime if
you're wearing Crocs and shorts he was
running Schwartz like above his knee
shorts I'm like you're Cooper mm-hmm no
he said you need help with anything he
comes in he has like this little
pamphlet that you can get during Holi
season Safari usually comes out with
this like little like holiday scent set
so you can come in and pick you like a
fragrance of your choice it's that's
what you did you came in and he's like
oh yeah I got this certificate I want to
pick a fragrance and I'm like cool so I
show them the figment of something these
are the ones that you can choose from
like let me know if you need help
smelling them not cup smelling them let
me know if you need like a little like a
fucking strip to like spray and smell
