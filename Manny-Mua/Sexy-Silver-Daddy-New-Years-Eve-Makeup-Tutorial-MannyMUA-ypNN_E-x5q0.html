really pretty purpley grungy glam look
okay cool so let's go get started on
today's video guys have an idea in my
head what I want to do with this look
today so let's just pray that turns out
is what we hope make forever smoothing
primer on the t-zone because I have
large porous pores you guys know this
like little craters of death mm-hm
and I'm gonna go ahead take this Too
Faced hangover RX prep oh my god that's
just dusting
I mean you doing so huh okay that's so
gross remember that on the rest of the
face oh well so good Oh have you guys
seen Moana I've seen a three fucking
times yeah I wanna see three times no
I'm not saying I want to see three times
but I went on three different occasions
I went the first one I went on was a
date
and it was really fun he was a cool guy
um he lives in San Diego something
anything it's gonna come from him but
he's really really cool and second time
I went with my mom and my dad because my
mom really wanted to see and so did my
dad he really wanted to see it too which
I loved that he wanted to see that and
then the third time with my mom my aunt
my grandma my aunt's family it was
basically a party for uh the second time
I went it was really funny it's actually
perfect I'm do my makeup on camera
because I have to go to an event after
this for the face I'm doing my go-to
event glam basically is what I'm doing
guys
you guys know I did a video on this
recently not recently back I did a video
on this already so you guys want to
check that out I'll leave it linked down
below if you guys are interested in that
if not all good but that's what I'm
doing
sure shaved more of my my mustache but
I'm sick let me fucking live my life
honestly though for real Moana was
amazing it's such a cool story I love it
so much and aesthetically the movie is
so beautiful it's such a beautiful movie
it's so insane like I don't know how the
fuck they make cartoons look that good
like please explain to me Disney how
that's possible
awesome I don't want to run or anything
but I love the I love the fact that in
this movie it's not like about love it's
not about finding a man or finding your
prince charming it's about like saving
your family you know I really like that
I like that Disney made a princess that
isn't about finding Prince Charming it's
about finding out who you are as a
person and saving your family's life or
whatever it is I'm not gonna spoil the
story or anything but I just I was
really really cool and I enjoyed it so
much I loved seeing strong female leads
and and strong female characters I love
it it's like when I was little you know
it is like I don't know me me just me
growing up gay I would always like wanna
play with the girl characters like the
strong girl characters instead of the
boy characters cuz they're just so much
more fun to me for some reason there's
some odd reason I'll just relate to the
girl character a lot more and I was like
why can't I wear a broader corset fuck
the fucking caveman but my mom cried
both times we saw it I was like mother
you are seriously PMS you ain't no and
she was haha she was actually PMSing
she's like I'm PMSing so don't fuck with
me I'm like nobody and then I take the
Laura Mercier powder and use that all
over the rest of the face and put that
on the t-zone with this little powder
puff Studio Fix powder Mac down the neck
so I just recently got this super cool
package from unicorn lashes I believe
it's called unicorn lashes and they have
the unicorn brushes they literally look
like a unicorn horn and they're brushes
they look like this and I thought they
were so fucking cool so I decided I
wanted to use a couple of them and take
a look at this freaking thing that is so
cool it's so cute and look at their like
multicolored remain fantastic
no you guys want to see a full-blown
review on them let me know and I can
definitely film one for you guys I'm
just going to be using this big powder
fluffy brush for some bronzer hmm
because it's tapered kind of funny today
is let's say Thursday I go out of town
tomorrow I fly to San Francisco because
I'm doing a mean greet with Macy's in
San Francisco and Union Square which I'm
so excited to be doing the fact I'm
doing it with Macy's it's like a I don't
know Macy's it just like seems like
really really cool you know like a big
brand Macy's is like Macy's San
Francisco is another one my favorite
places do me in greets because you guys
are so so fucking sweet they're like I
cannot even begin to explain how nice
you guys are like I don't know what it
is about people in terms of scale
they're just so sweet and so caring and
just so calm and nice and I just love
that this town first was one of the
pieces that I really remember and so the
same with Texas Texas and remember a lot
too because there's so much love there
and it's always so crazy in Texas
everything's bigger in Texas they say
why 9 Kevin Kwan so after that on Monday

that's the day I get to meet the winner
of the benefit sweepstakes that me and
Patrick did we are flying out to San
Francisco to meet the winner to just
kind of spend the day with us you know
I'm really excited that benefit does
these kind of things it's really cool
it's very intimate which I love of
course I love meeting greets and those
are so much fun but if I can sit back
and like actually chitchat and talk with
you guys that's just so much more like a
mic ally I love to just sit back relax
I don't know cuz meeting greet to get
really stressful because I want to meet
as many of you guys as I can but there's
a time limit on these things always I
get stressed I'm like I'm gonna know
about like they waited in line I want to
meet them you guys know I'm I want you

am really really excited to be doing
this with benefit and I know Patrick
fealy excited about it too so it's gonna
be fun day on Monday heartthrob makeup
geek little little little blusher brush
this is a beautiful blush holy fuck dude
I'm like running out of this powder if
they just made this powder this one
thing and this whole thing I'd be so
golden
I'd be golden I'd be bronze that was
getting a be golden I'm going to take
the white number one from Burberry white
number one
I'm going to be doing more of a silvery
lid look I've decided I want to do
silver with a Cameroon crease I think it
sounds super cool on a morphic why 14
and so I figure if I was doing more like
a silvery look I want to do more of an
icy highlight you know I'm saying I'm
gonna dust that on oh that's so
beautiful
okay cool so let's go ahead and do the
brows off of camera real quick and I'll
be right back
okay great so I went ahead and finished
my brows off of a camera and now I'm
gonna go ahead and do my eye look I
primed the eyes off of camera and I'm
thinking I'm gonna grab the Miss Tascha
to known a star palette cuz everyone's
been raving about this little bitch and
I'm gonna take a couple of the Maroons
from this palette and then use a silver
from something else but I'm gonna use
these first I'm gonna take this really
pretty middle shade right here uh-huh
right there on a little more feet why 16
brush just go right in it's like a
really pretty soft lilac pink shade and
I thought because we're gonna be going
with Maroons I think that's a really
good transition jaded to have down first
very soft very just pretty petal like
soft pink in the crease so now I'm going
to go in with this really pretty plum
burgundy on a more free and 4-3-3 and
I'm actually gonna mix it with this
warmer burgundy I decided in right now
and this is exactly on that I decided
I'm gonna put that into the crease of my
eye basically what the crease do I have
other than my fucking ass crack so
beautiful I'm gonna take that in to the
crease I'm going to go all the way in to
the inner part of my eye right above my
crease right there as you can see and
then everything below that will be the
silver these natascha shadows blend out
very well the mattes blend very very
very nicely Wow
click on you have to really do anything
they just did it by itself and once you
have the desired plumbness to your eye
this is what I see and this is what I
like right now I'm just blending a
little bit and now I want to go in with
the metal morph assist chef I'm gonna go
with that silver that silver is calling
my name how do I open this little
scissors please god I don't have time
for this please i want sequin everywhere
please oh hey you and you okay guys so
what I decided to do for
I'm gonna take that silver cream base
and that's going to go on to my lid as
well as kind of carve out where I want
to put the silver shadow and where I
want to keep the purple showing okay so
I'm gonna do first I'm gonna take a more
feet a 32 and I'm gonna use this cream
we're go ahead and kind of carve out
where I want the silver oh that looks so
beautiful holy crap
I love that and that's just with the
cream base imagine with the frickin
thing on top okay do the other side real
quick I'm gonna go ahead and set it with
the corresponding shadow which is this
intense mirrored silver I'm very very
excited put this on I first must have
had it on with my finger just to go over
the cream that is so fucking sick let's
go and just toss it in the inner corner
as well already going in man turn and
it's so hard to get back into a
lightweight blend I like the like
harshness of the silver against this
like really pretty burgundy matte shade
but I want to keep it kind of blended
not too too harsh just the way any
fallout if you have any just in case
from the silver very very pigmented so
it's I knew that there would be some
kind of a low for sure so let's go ahead
I'll eat the brown but I'm gonna take
the same highlighter I use on the face
for the brow bone right at the top point
of my brow you know this is our more
bold look so we're gonna fucking take it
there monster do it take a little
blending brush the morphe key 30 here oh
my god I'm so good so I'm gonna go and
take those same maroon shades from the
Natasha de Nonna palette I'm gonna blend
that underneath the lash line and blend
out that black shade to make a nice and
smoky but still very very Varun and halo
prating okay so go and smoke that lower
lash line out and you have something
like this okay great so I went ahead and
I finish the blue lash line on both eyes
off of camera as well as put mascara on
and do my eyeliner off of camera so this
is what it looks like I want to do a
nice bold wing so now we're gonna put
some lashes on these are also from
unicorn lash
is go do these magazines for lashes so Q
this is in the style Bambi hopefully
these aren't too small for my eyes so go
ahead and put some lash glue on I'm just
taking the House of lashes lash glue the
lash glue I always use it works
fantastically my lashes never have
problems the glue though is a bitch to
take off okay so the first time I'm
wearing this pair please work on me just
please just please work with me here
come on they're pretty they're actually
very very pretty they're very natural on
me I said what I feel like any lash
that's not Bella new bouncing lashes are
gonna look natural on me but this lash
is beautiful and I approve as soon as
the lashes go on I'm like instant bitch
like one time she met John Stamos on a
plane and he told her she was pretty one
time she punched me in the face it was
awesome
cool so now we have the lashes on we are
done with the eyes now you have to
finish off with the lips I just don't
want lip to do fuck okay guys so I'm
thinking ah Nastasia Heather's I'm using
Anasazi liquid lipsticks a lot recently
okay I'm gonna use the lip pencil in the
shade grunge just to kind of map out
it's not gonna be an exact color for it
or anything just gonna map out lightly
this looks so beautiful as it is
honestly it really does so you can keep
it like this it looks fantastic just
with the lip liner I think it looks
great or you can add the Heather's on
top I'm gonna go ahead and do that now
go ahead and add Heather's by Anastacio
