of calm tell take it is that bad hey
guys so welcome back to my channel so
today's video is going to be another
installment of my prom series that this
is really a series I mean I like that
one video so technically it's not really
serious and I've only done one what this
video is going to be how to do this look
on my eyes it is a much more cool toned
look it has some silver and some purples
and I got so many requests from you guys
to do much more of a cool tone look for
people that are wearing more like
purples and blues and their dresses and
things like that so I think this look
will go great with that black white
purple blue out of a green well yeah if
you guys don't like this kind of video
you guys don't like watching the boy put
on makeup I'm not forcing you
you guys are clicking the play button so
if you guys don't like it don't
watch it
though bro I do I had to go all gangster
and Shane laughs okay I did but if you
do subscribe because you know without
further ado geek that's the tutorial
this I look hopefully you guys like it
so I'll see you guys later right so
let's go ahead and get this bitch star
tin
okay first things first is obviously I
have my foundation on and have my like
base down my highlight and contour done
I'm just going to focus on the eyelid
today because I like is more on the
intricate side so I think I don't waste
any time if you guys are interested in
seeing my full face like routine I'll go
and link my last prom tutorial down
below if you guys are interested in that
 so you guys can see like what I did
on my face go so now first things first
we're gonna go ahead and prime our lids
we're gonna use the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer as our primer I use this
primer quite often I just like it
because it cancels out any darkness and
redness on my head when I said it with
some powder it just it doesn't crease on
me lsolde a I really like it and I'm
gonna go ahead and set it with a very
light just translucent powder I just
wanted to be able to be blended into a
little bit easier so I'm just using a
translucent powder i'm using the laura
mercier translucent
I'm actually pretty excited to do
today's video because I have a plan to
do a cool tone eye it's like my plan I'm
a plan to do a cool tone so I'm like yes
I can do this I know I do warm tones all
the time try to be brave and do cool
tones so this is my color palette scheme
for today I think it's very cool tone I
think it's be really pretty I think
it'll work out pretty well
wish me some luck cuz mama needs it so
first things first we're gonna go and
start with the Sigma e-40 and go in with
peaches and cream and that's um go into
our crease this is my makeup geek it's
my favorite transition shade of all time
it's just a great shape because it's
very neutral it's not too warm it's not
too cool and it gives me a nice
transition so that all my shadows can
blend into them way easier then if I
could without it if that makes sense
makeup geek shadows aren't my favorite
shadows like a fault I'm basically like
Isis so where to go there so what so
good and they're only six bucks like I
just they slay me like they slay me hard
so I'm gonna go ahead and take a more
feet and four three three and I'm gonna
take a little bit of Barcelona Beach now
that's not to go into our crease as well
I'm just gonna kind of mix it in with
that peaches and cream I wanted to be a
little more cool tone and this Barcelona
Beach is a very cool tone new show Brown
so I'm gonna go ahead just put that to
the crease and blend that into the
Korean Nigel Sun so now I'm actually
gonna go in with dusty rose but I got a
saucy Beverly Hills and that is gonna
also go into our crease with a morphe at
4:33 and this is gonna really help bring
that cool tone in we shouldn't go right
in to the crease with it
take it all the way into the front of
the crease go back in with the Sigma
e-40 and blend that out because we don't
want any hard transitions you know
blending out with an e 40 is just it's
so crucial to me I do this all the time
you guys know you guys watch my channel
you guys feel what I'm doing you feeling
it look at me being cool toned
I'm so proud though before I forget I'm
gonna go and highlight my brow bone I'm
gonna use on a saw simply i shadow on a
Sophie 315 that I'm just gonna toss onto
my highlighted area so now I'm asking
that this is be brave we're gonna go in
with Dutchess eyeshadow by make a deep
very tiny baby amount of it to fall off
and I wanted just a little bit more
purple to it I think it's gonna be
pretty with a little bit more fullness
to it it's the outer corner and then
taking it up very slightly into the
crease and blending that out with an e
40 just gonna help bring this nice cool
tone purpleness to the look and I think
it looks so sick it's like that there's
a little further in because I think it
looks sitting very like almost
non-existent pressure it feels like
you're not touching yourself you're
doing a right just blend with that u4t
again it looks something like this it's
nice little cool tone a purpley grayish
crease now I'm gonna go ahead and grab
moondust
shadow by makeup geek and it's like a
nice preach go bead taupe color whatare
in so I'm gonna take on a more fugitive
team now I'm just gonna press on to the
lid this is gonna be the big art base
shadow it's a very cool tone taupey
color then I'll go in with them four
three three and with no additional
product I'm not just really kind of
blend out the edges and then for like
the sickening part I'm gonna take on a
saucer doggy Hills eyeshadow metal on my
finger so now I'm actually gonna run on
my lid and look how freakin intense that
is that is sickening I'm gonna take
that on the lid and press that on over
moondust
it was just like shimmery intenseness
 man I want more I want more
intensity one more so I'm gonna take
fix+
on that same g15 and spray that bitch
with things get it wet with this nice
intense metallic look I mean I'm
going cool tone for the first time like
ever let me go crane I'm also gonna take
a little bit of metal in my inner corner
as well I'm gonna give me that
intense and s highlight we're gonna grab
the morphe M 507 which is like a little
tiny baby tapered brush its don't kill
and I'm gonna go in with corrupt shadow
by makeup geek and now I'm gonna run on
the outer corner very lightly nothing
too intensely make a little V I don't
want it to be too intense because I want
to keep that purple like very prominent
but I do want a little bit darker
thank goodness for this little pointed
brush because this is precise as
hell and I'll go back in with it and
four three three and just kind of blend
out that even more so you can have
something like this for the top of the
lid I know cuz I'm gonna grab a little
pencil brush and I'm gonna grab make it
geek my beach is name cream and mix it
in with dusty rose behind a saucy
Beverly Hills and I'm gonna run down
underneath my lash line so I'm really
trying to keep that nice grayish dusty
rose color going and then on a more
precise morphe M 508 which is a very
tiny little personal talked about this
before it's gray again you underneath
the lash line I'm going to take that
same depth just shadow I'm a geek and
that I'm just gonna run underneath my
lash I'm very close to my lash links I
wanted to be just a very subtle hint of
purple
so I'm gonna go ahead and do some
highlighter I'm gonna grab the Kat Von D
tattoo liner right now it's my favorite
liner like I'm obsessed okay this is how
I'm obsessed okay I'm obsessed with it
in the way of doing my wing then I fill
it in with another liner I don't have
that me sense like I do love this
because it gives me the most precise
wing and I think it's beautiful but when
it dries it's like it dries kind of
shiny ish and I don't like that I like
more more like a matte dry down so I do
like my outline of the wing with this
and then I'll fill it in with a
different liner yeah go to our wings
boom not television
so fill it in I'm gonna go ahead and
take my makeup forever ink liner that
drives max it's a little teeny did I
just
okay travesty was slightly aborted so I
think it looks okay aborted Tom he go
ahead and finish the bottom of the eye
I'm gonna use the same 508 brush with
correct a little bit of corrupt and that
something go underneath the bottom lash
line well only on the outer third though
that's just for some bonus definition so
now that we have our eye done we have
one eye done I'm gonna go and finish
other eye off-camera and it will be
right back so I have shadows on for both
of the eyes I'm actually gonna align my
waterline with the NYX pitch black Trey
Jolie liner this bitch is so dark and
like so good like I'm sure I see let's
do the other side so this way because I
wasn't actually going with the brown one
but I'm like no that's warm he's strong
and you're gonna go in with the cool
toned liner damning I'm gonna go on with
benefit roller lash mascara I've been
really loving this mascara lately so I'm
just gonna use that bitch in my lash
bitches
so we're gonna go ahead do lashes
obviously we're going to prom we want to
be Q we want to be dumb you want to be
seen from a dance fans so we're gonna do
lashes so I'm gonna go ahead with
blinking B lashes in number one style
number one it's a very beautiful wispy
pair so I think this is gonna be a
stunning shade for problem pop these
bitches on yes prom lashes though nigga
lashes are on me guys n to show you guys
what they look like up close now that we
have the heist done I'm gonna go and
just do the face or Emily's this I'm
gonna finish the face I'd have like my
base down at my foundation on I have my
concealer I got my contour she's be okay
so let's go ahead and do brushes what
the so for blush I'm gonna go ahead
and grab a sculpting blush by Makeup
Forever in the shade 10 which looks like
this it's just beautiful pinky coral
color so it's going to toss that on to
the apples of my cheeks I don't want too
much blush on because this look is so
much more intense on the eye and so I
think that's why I like this blush so
much is because it doesn't come on
intense at all it's very buildable you
can see how it's like coming it's
starting to build putting it right above
my contour with my morphe g5 did that
very soft beautiful blush oh my god I
love this blush now I'm gonna go in with
makeup forever sculpting duo highlight
in the shade one which is like it's like
the other one I was talking about in my
favorites video but this is the more
cool tone pinkier version of the other
one and that I'm gonna take on my morphe
501 and I'm gonna grab that highlight
shade and I'm just gonna put that in my
highlight area this highlight is a
beautiful silvery pink highlight oh my
god look at that bitch i am i glowing
glowing i'm so with Furio
okay focus manual it's go into the lips
now I'm gonna take Mac volibear lip
liner I know I is proud of me for not
using people who try I almost did but
this was a little bit more neutral then
peek-a-boo peek-a-boo is very warm in
tones I'm trying to be more than neutral
right you know someone just like my list
I've actually gonna line my entire lip
with bully bear by Mac sorry I don't
have either but I love bolding bear - I
forgot how much
volibear I live for boldly and now I'm
actually in a grabbed Anasazi Beverly
Hills lipgloss and undressed which is a
very nude beige gloss I'm gonna just
