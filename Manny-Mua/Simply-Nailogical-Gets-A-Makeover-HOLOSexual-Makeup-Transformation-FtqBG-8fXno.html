really really great thank you to your

I'll leave of course link down below as
well as her video bi you guys let's get
into this transformation
she has more dryer skin so we're gonna
focus on what your skin has very tanana
glowy skin oh my god you poor you guys
you got burns more dry I'm going to use
a little bit of fix plus we're take the
Too Faced hangover RX primer it's a nice
nourishing primer cuz I was drinking too
much you sure won't just tell me Manny
what you really think you sure were
isn't that for makeup yes but you need
to apply like moisturizer tons of things
so now we're going some foundation guys
wanna take the co Gendo aqua foundation
in the shade 113 I just have this might
or I don't know this is in your shade
we're going to try it I'm going to a
little pump and put a little bit on the
cheek just to see how it blends we're
gonna use it doesn't work yeah I think
it totally works look I think it's
blending into your skin so nice II can't
even tell you same color mm-hmm you do
have really nice skin so you don't want
to cover it up you know nice yes you do
no pores you just look snatched snatched
nachi so wait your makeup in my neck I'm
just taking a little bit down cuz you
are a little bit more fair on the neck
doesn't want to match it a little bit
better but I'm gonna do a very soft
layer that's why I'm blending it down
with a sponge looks really great on you
looks really natural and I look more I
look all the same color
yeah where did you never do a little bit
the Tarte shape tape oh I know that is
yeah cuz you have one I'm so proud of
you watch you guys Jeff she has some
tart shape to guys but she has the wrong
color it's true not only am i concealing
what is I'm highlighting as well
is that how you get dates to like you
just highlight I want to know cuz I'm
honey
now how you look up for me dude you have
no one rides not yet
holy shit just under eyes okay yes you
are highlighted I'm look up for me okay
and I like to bake or like set the eye
from the backwards going in so you're
using a Beauty Blender yeah he's not a
brush no because you have since you're
saying that you have drier skin I'm also
using a I'm also using the RCM a no
color powder which is a powder that's a
really really good for people that are
more dry because it doesn't pick up on
your dry patches and it doesn't like
make you feel drier the areas that are
more Creasy for example like you have
more smiling to here on the areas I do
too like to use a more excessive amount
of powder there cuz I just feel like
when you're applying without damp Beauty
Blender it just helps with
moisturization okay
guys she's still burned back here like
we're not gonna show now imma dust away
the excess powder my guys to get watery
har they do because I was laughing so
that's your father so guys I'm gonna
take a little bit of bronzer now this is
the Marc Jacobs fantastic runs err
that's expensive
mmm lightly bronze up the forehead I
don't tan it just peels same no really
yeah I don't go into the Sun are you a
vampire mm-hmm
first lightly brush their bronzer so
this isn't contour right no this is more
like just bronzing up the skin making it
look more healthy or I put it right into
the hollow of your dad I know what blush
is this we're taking wet and wild which
is a drugstore blush mmm in the shape
pearlescent pink placing on the apples
and blending it backwards I think that's
because you have to know such nice
cheekbones already we're taking my
jeffree star cosmetics x-man emu a
highlighter
oh ma look at that
oh shit oh my god can you put it like
all over maybe I can't so you put it
right up towards the eye I like to I
like to tell you like I could always
round it out here like a moon yeah like
a little crescent moon so you just dust
the entire nose for you because it's a
small petite cute nose
yes and the chin on the chin a little
bit cute chance no chin just like to
focus the glow in those centered areas
well that was pretty painless easy right
we're gonna do a little bit more of fix+
easy breezy beautiful Maybelline I'm and
this is to help melt in the foundation
everything till they look less pottery
yes or take on a saucy eyebrow is in the
shade of soft brown let's see that works
for you are you soft brown in the pod no
way yeah I know it's like a little red
for me this is medium brown I'm gonna go
with medium as well to do my actual base
so do you prefer the pencils or the pods
I'll be the pencils yeah it's just
easier to like map something out okay so
you're actually drawing on it yeah
exactly those two the painting yes ah
yeah exactly okay let's keep the brow I
guess more than natural sight I think
when I started filling my brows and I
was listening to Instagram oh God who's
the palm added and then it was like
really thick just really dark and it
just looked wrong it's intense that pump
means a really intense air pump yeah
however you say it
pommade I say call me pommade that's the
same of Jose because he speaks French
guys okay she's talented you can the one
speak French have a day job you edit
your own videos I mean I do too but
still goddamn she'd has different shaped
brows not obviously in a bad way or
anything that it's just different this
one has thicker hair here so you kind of
have to focus my product on the outer
corner what I'm doing brows on people I
like to follow like how their brow shape
looks on that one brow and then how that
brow shape looks and try to make as much
glass as possible or take the Mac
painterly paint-pot
oh that's
the Paint Pot mm-hmm I've heard that
this is yes Mac painterly paint-pot this
is what I like what I was using in the
last video membrane yeah lightly set the
primary place down so what kind of looks
we do do I don't know what do something
kind of more bold I wanna be sexy oh
okay God receive jacket he'll palette
use my coat simply for temper set ah um
you don't have a co in Morphy so you
need a back they'll shut on our 30 a
brush guys the outer portion and we're
gonna blend it into the lid so we're
gonna put it into the crease guys so she
was saying earlier she thought that this
was a crease right there
but the crease is actually like right
here but you can like see when you're
like tilting you head up in the orbital
bone I feel like that's something
regular people didn't realize no
definitely might take a or darky Brown
no focus it on the outer corner into
that little V we're gonna do like some
glitter on the lids because I feel like
okay you're known for holographic I
would love sex for you to decorate my
face lightly blend our ice keep watering
there we're not gonna really be able to
focus a lot of product there so I
grabbed them with the tissue everyone
we're going to know we're gonna make it
fucking work it's not matting a little
bit of a darker color on the outer
corner guys to give that some definition
now guys we're going to be taking the
diamond dust by Stila I wouldn't put
that all over - I have to let it dry yes
a little bit please I shouldn't open
mine not yet a little bit we don't want
it to go away yet so and you guys can
just stare at my nose instead mm-hmm
nature can and they're gonna like it and
we're likely blending the edges guys by
the way
so you blend the wet into the dry yes
mm-hmm just slightly just to give it a
little bit it's not as harsh if I wanted
to do something cut crease or something
one tense that
fine but this way I just want to have a
nice Lendl end it's a little hard to do
this stuff because Claire doesn't blend
out so you have to just kind of be
willing to finagle damn mommy you sexy
so now guys we're gonna go in with some
brown liner because you do have a green
hazel eyes your eyes actually kind of
similar to mine it looks good I never
put shit in my water really no and I'm
gonna blend out the excess here to
continue on because that's gonna be our
way kind of cheating the fact that you
keep crying off of that stuff that's
fine just look like up to the side and I
go perfect yeah that's right I just need
that like your eye to be open basically
I'm just running a low transition shade
right here transitions just basically we
did in the top we're doing in the bottom
didn't I
oh is that a highlight yeah we're gonna
highlight we're taking a highlighting
shade from the dark in that way mixing
the top two I'm gonna highlight and then
I live on the brow bone as well just to
give it a little bit of a lift at the
top most point that's nice okay so you
do it right here like at the point not
not all around it that's right not touch
I just want to focus on like opening I
enough rake right here without looking
too so you don't Cleary that up or down
no okay right there dang simply ha
logical I'm gonna do Adam have you open
your eyes look down okay like this like
that I'm gonna lightly do a super thin
soft layer now we're going to apply some
mascara
I'm actually happy you applied your own
mascara okay are you sure you trust me
I sure do please God you guys were gonna
put some lashes on these are cute little
pair from the lower lashes that are cut
to fit you specifically tiny tiny your
tiny the lashes sit down for sure darlin
okay yes what are you T Oh God
my little Cindy illogical with her
little lashes lip pencil can I go nude
on you my lips it's a game we're gonna
really try to fake that you have bigger
lips though so every night darker look
like we're gonna cheat the system here
yeah what if I like yeah no we're a
little bit okay I'm just letting y'all
know we're gonna do it just just the
hair dude we're gonna do Geoffrey start
mannequin man can you get maybe a
mannequin yep like do it correctly
taking a little bit of boss to the
center just for the center here a little
bit of shine and voluptuousness to this
pucker it kind of looks like I got
injection so now you know you look like
again injection yeah yeah that looks
insane like I didn't realize that you do
you're lying snacks good over line lips
