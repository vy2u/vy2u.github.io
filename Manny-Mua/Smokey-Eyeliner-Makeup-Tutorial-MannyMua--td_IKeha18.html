today is gonna be on how to smoke out
your eyeliner and I think this is this
is such an easy look you guys it's so
Universal it's so simple to do it just
takes a couple steps the end result is
so great and it looks good on absolutely
everyone and so I really wanted to show
you that this I love you more liking the
makeup I had in my December favorites
video we're going with the deep plum red
lip and sorry I wanted to go with this
lip because this is a little like lip I
like you know I guess why I could always
do a tutorial using that lip as well if
there's one see but this is the eye look
I had in it and I wanted to show you
guys how I did it because so many people
requested me to do it so this is the
look and so without further ado let's go
ahead and you to the tutorial become I
feel like Inc my intros are so
long and I just want to get guys to man
you know so let's start the shenanigans
that does please so first thing what
we're gonna do is we're gonna start off
with some tape to be honest I'm not the
biggest fan of using tape and makeup in
general there's only two things I use
before I use it for smoked out liner
like this and I use it for glitter and
so we're getting into peace nothing too
crazy and then we're going to cut it in
half so one piece goes on each eye and
the reason I'm cutting in habit so that
I don't get so much like of my
foundation like ripped off because I
have foundation on already usually you
want to do this makeup before you have
makeup on but I'm stupid and I'm glad
and so what I'm doing is I'm sticking
the two pieces of tape on the back of my
hand so we can take off the first layer
of like stickiness so doesn't rip off
our eye when you're placing the tape
what you want to do so we're gonna grab
the tape with both hands and we're gonna
line it right underneath be very careful
with this please go right underneath the
lashes that's core number I you see that
right there the reason we're going
underneath our lashes is because we
don't rip off our actual eyelashes
please so now you have this nice
straight line from the bottom of your
lash line going out all the way to your
brow okay which let's take that there
and the part honestly this part does not
not to be stud this part is not to be
stuck the part that really matters is
this part right here this really needs
to be against the skin so you can have
that sharp crisp line okay so first
things first we're going to go in with
our transition shape just how we go in
with transition shades we're doing
normal
look we're going to go in with the
transition for this as well for me I'm
going to be going in with makeup geek
beaches and cream I've gone it's kind of
my main room and the luck see Beauty 207
brush which came in the djinns makeup
brush collection which is really it's
beautiful Gina did a great job with her
brush collection I think they're
absolutely amazing that's what we're
going to do is literally we're gonna go
with that beaches color mi is already
primed by the way is primed I'm
gonna go in and we're going to really
just feather that forward into the eye
from our crease all the way in to about
halfway through our eye on the lid to
half the whole eye what you want to have
covered with the transition all the way
out to the tape this brush is perfect
this because it's so fluffy it's not too
intense and it's actually it's an angled
brush and you can tell but it's angled
so it's really great diffusing from the
top and it's much more dense towards the
base boom so we have a transition color
down first and then we're gonna
transition again we're going to be using
a massager Beverly Hills color and fawn
the reason I'm using this color font is
because I want it to be a very neutral
look I don't want to be too warm I don't
want to be too cool and now we're gonna
grab on a more feet m43 3 which is I've
talked about this many times one of my
favorite brushes and now we're going to
take just a little bit lower closing
your eye again taking a little bit lower
Donna Satya shadows are so amazing so
soft so pigmented and this one we're
going to just take about halfway down
the eye and into the crease as well and
outwards and we're just putting on that
a little bit lower than that Beaches
color and then I'll just go back in with
that original brush show you what that
luxu brush there's kind of blend
everything together I'm a freak about
transitions I need them to be completely
completely effortless I do not like
seeing any hard lines at all it's one
eye biggest pet peeve so I really like
having some very diffused easy
transition I'll apply a little bit more
fun towards the base like that so should
look something like this so when you're
looking down if the most pigment on the
outer corner and it transitions outwards
from here out to here you can see that
it's fading into lightness so now we're
gonna go in with makeup geek rub a
shadow which is probably the blackest
eye shadow I've ever ever ever used it's
5 dollars like are you kidding
I get so amazing and we're also going to
go in with the pencil brush prime you
could beat this well it's actually one
of the best brushes for tight lining and
for detailed work that I've ever
used and make a history ever so we're
going with that we're going to load up
that brush you don't need a lot correct
because the correct eyeshadow is
extremely extremely extremely pigmented
so just pick up a little on the brush
and now we're going to go even lower
than fun now we're going to run by our
lashes about half way in pick up a
little bit more product if you need
somewhere and that we're gonna run along
the tape about we are natural creases
about a go so that's we're going to go
up to right there and then we're going
to kind of bring it down here as well we
want to be extremely extremely black by
the lash line so really just packing it
on by the lash line and then lighter
pressure going upwards now that we have
the black down we're going to go in with
another clean blending brush I don't
want it to have any other product on it
and with the makeup geek eye blender
brush which looks like this it's a
little angled brush and now we're really
going to just buff in that black with
the into the fawn you don't need me new
this just blend your little heart away
and because you have to tape there it's
kind of foolproof this way now we're
just kind of taking it outwards it's
just one of those looks that it's kind
of laborious because I have a kind of a
lot of steps to do this but honestly
like the finished product is so worth it
look see how fast that was blended out
like this is why it's so extremely
crucial to have those transition colors
down first because it makes everything
so much faster and everything much more
smooth and so now that we have that
blended out I'm gonna go back in with a
little bit more correct because I really
really really really want to be the
darkest possible
look something like this so you can see
that my liner is very diffused and very
blended I just noticed that I took it
farther than I wanted to take it the
black I wanted to go about halfway not
really necessarily like 3/4 of the way
so I'm actually gonna fix that a little
bit so what I decided to do is I decided
to grab a big shading kind of brush and
I grabbed my mistake color so for
example if I want to kind of a race a
shadow or kind of diffuse it out even
more I would color that a night I like
to call it like my race color and for me
it's vanilla bean by makeup geek what I
mean by erase I basically mean I'm going
to load up this vanilla bean color I'm
gonna pack it onto the lid very lightly
and blend it outwards in to the shadows
and as you can see right there it's
starting to diffuse out even more and
that's kind of what I wanted to happen I
didn't want my black to be so far in so
I'll grab this vanilla bean and I'll
take it and run it over the black to
give it a nice blue eye
you're diffused look see that now
definitely not gone it's not erased like
I was saying but it's definitely a lot
less and pigmented in a lot less intense
and then I'll just kind of go back in
with that black no I'm just vanilla bean
on my browbone as well it isn't it's a
nice bone white shadow it's not too
intense it's a little slight slight
slight sheen to it it's nothing too
heavy at all and those are my kind of
items I'm not really the biggest fan of
those intense brow highlights a lot of
people are they love them I'm just not
one of those people so now that we have
everything diffused and blended I'm
going to take off the team
carefully to give me this winged out
shadow liner and the cool thing about
liner like this is that if you are like
me and you have like a hood here that
wants to fall on your lid this isn't
going to transfer at all because it's a
shadow it's not an actual liner so you
get that nice definition on the outer
corner of the eye but it's not gonna
transfer and this is why I don't like
doing the tape methods because it
removes my foundation and my concealer
so what we can do to fix that grab any
concealer brush like the concealer brush
that you used earlier like today and
I'll grab it and I'm just going to run
it over
let's spot with the tape to kind of just
diffuse out fact that there was a hard
line there this will just help me really
buff it out and this is the morphe m33 5
one of my favorite concealer brushes of
all time I talked about this in my
December favorites video it's absolutely
amazing and so what I'll do is just kind
of buff out the line and look see not
nearly as intense and that's crazy as it
was before okay so I'm gonna go to the
outside real quick and I will be right
back my little darling okay I'm going so
now we have the tops of both eyes done
they look like this honestly they're not
completely 100,000% symmetrical but it
honestly does not matter that much to
really to be honest like as long as you
get a symmetrical as you possibly can no
one can fault you for trying this is
even as I'm gonna get four right now so
yeah so just don't don't fret if you
guys don't get it
completely even for the first time it's
one of those things that just takes a
learning curve especially if you're
doing it for the first time so don't
give up on it because I need you guys to
do it don't you give up on me
I'm gonna kick your ass okay so now
we're gonna do the bottom lash line
we're not actually do really much the
bottom lash line at all when I do a
liner like this I like to keep my bottom
lash line just clean and clear as
possible
okay good you're doing a common
technique they are gonna grab that say
make a deep brush and whatever we have
left on this brush we're just gonna run
it on the lower lash line barely like
barely now I'm talking just the outer
corner only tailors a little
something-something right there
not too much though when I take that
about a 30% in I mean exact now we're
kind of blend that out I really just
don't want anything too harsh out here
and I'll just buff it out with whatever
we have left on that morphe brush to the
m4 33 so it's something like this it's
not too intense on the outer corner but
you have a little bit definition and I
want to keep the definition solely on
the outer corner so that's we really you
just want to keep it on the outer side
not okay we're just gonna put a quick
coat of mascara on this is the Too Faced
better than sex better than the same
thing my lashes are so ugly it's on you
money put a lid on the bottom tuned
carefully whoo sexy me you know what
that's enough I'm considering myself
lucky right now with the amount I have
on so that's my money so now we're going
to go in with lashes we're gonna go in
with the blinking view number 4 which
are these because we're really focusing
all the attention on the outer corner so
we're going in with these lashes because
they flare out at the ends I hope you
guys can tell me flare okay so much
anxiety taking out minks god what a
quick little coat of duo not too heavily
not too heavily oh my god so I watched
into the woods tonight with my friends
and I am like so in musical mode right
now it's I'm so much in like play mode I
just want to like second bust out and
sing and dance and be really gain you
know look down pin the lashes on look
down play some the blinking beaut lashes
go Slade I'm done momma Slade she's done
she's had her tea she ate her pot is
full I'm Slade so we have one lash on
let's go and do the lash on the other
side oh my gosh if this mirror doesn't
open I have a lash on my hand I'm
hearing that one hoping
I rule the world
yes lashes yes number fours give it to
me hard okay now we have our lashes on
let me just go ahead and zoom you guys
in to the final I look
yes so that was it for the final I like
hopefully you guys enjoyed this video
hopefully you guys learned something
from it I really enjoyed making this for
you guys I think that this look is so
easy so universal anyone can do it some
work for all different shapes of eyes
and it's just one of those things works
like do it everyone will look good in
them okay
oh and just guess people are wondering
I'm wearing the girl acted Beauty matte
lip paint in starlet that's the lip
color where I know this is actually one
my favorite clothes of the moment I had
got this at Fame Expo I really like used
it I completely fell in love with it all
over again and so I'm just like holy
crap starlet where were you in my life I
would check out the girl act equip
paints they are absolutely amazing and
they're one of the best I've ever tried
ever and liquid lipstick for and one
more thing one more thing so a company /
app hit me up and they're like hey Manny
we love your videos
we're a new app we're just starting out
we would love for you to talk about it
in your videos and I'm like you're an
app and you're hitting me have to talk
about your app on my videos I'm a beauty
channel like that makes no sense to me
so I was just I kind of blew it off and
I'll just like you won't know like
that's so weird like why would I talk
about your app on my channel like that's
up right so I just basically didn't
reply and I'm sorry I'm sorry to you
guys for not replying first time because
I just didn't see how it applied my
channel they hit me up again door like
hey we apply to beauty in the beauty
world and I was like you do how it's
basically again like an online closet
that makes sense
it's called snupps and the reason I
thought it could be applied to you guys
if you guys are interested in this kind
of thing because this just happened to
me a Mac all the time where someone
would come in and they would forget
their color they would forget what I
shows they had they would forget
literally like everything and they're
like I don't know what I have a reading
on my god I'm not in the system I don't
know basically this app kind of prevents
that the app stores it in like your
little makeup file and it's like okay
cool this is like the makeup that you
have this is the name of it just in case
you might forget anything you can make
it private you can make a public you can
show people you have we can show people
you don't have it just it doesn't matter
right up to that I'm not gonna go into
too much detail about the app
necessarily I just wanna let you guys
know about it if you guys do have
problems with remembering items while
you're out shopping and you're like I
don't know if I have this already like
what am I to do I don't know my color I
forgot it so the guys interesting
Samantha go check it out um it's called
snuffs again I understand you guys know
because snubs was kind to me and they
said all these wonderful things and I
know what it's like to start um start
fresh and starting you you know what
everyone start
somewhere like it's not fair for me to
just be able to accept makeup you know I
mean it's not fair for me to just accept
makeup and just talk about makeup all
the time at all times and not give other
brands or other companies or any other
anything a chance to talk to be talked
about you know and so everyone starts
there you know what I mean like I only
grew in my channels and they thoughts
because people talked about me and
people grew me and they helped me they
lifted me up so why what I deny that tip
app check because they're an app you
know what I mean so hopefully you guys
do great snaps um if you guys are
interested in that like that go check
them out if you aren't totally all good
this is still my makeup channel it's not
going to be for everyone it's a
smartphone app so yeah I just let you
guys know if you guys aren't shouldn't
something like that if not then please
just ignore that PDA PG a one - what's a
comm public service PSA and go on that
pan thing isn't and yeah so let me know
