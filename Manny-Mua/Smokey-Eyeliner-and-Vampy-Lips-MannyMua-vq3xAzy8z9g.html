guys been I have been really well I bet
this one this is going up as we make the
week of Halloween when this goes up I'm
like so excited for all the way I'm
gonna be a witch on Halloween Day but
then I think I'm going I'm going to a
party the day before Halloween and I'm
gonna be snow white I think yeah so I'm
really excited because I'm gonna be snow
white and I'm gonna be going with my
friends Patrick and Nikki and I don't
know if I should say what they're gonna
be I don't know if they've announced it
yet so what I'm gonna do now is I'm
gonna quite add some dimension to this
flat ass face because I feel like I'm
very highlighted and great wait mom I
said nothing Nick I'm gonna add some
dimension to this mug because that mug
is not right right now so I'm gonna take
my new favorite like bronzing brush ever
it is named Orpheum five to seven little
chocolates Elaine I'm just going to dip
the ditch in I'm just gonna bronze up
the face with this you guys I've been
like really lucky in this brush recently
this one's milk chocolate Soleil because
I'm a light s e-g away go if you are
darker complexion they have dark
chocolate Soleil just kind of bronzing
up the skin giving me some more
dimension luckily like when you have a
more intense under-eye highlight and
make sure I cheat bones puff so much
more so that's a kind of the good thing
about having an intense under-eye how
when it's like whitest bug I'm getting
at the chocolate Soleil in my
mouth as I'm talking it's so funny could
taste like chocolate and it's like so
obvious that it's of this but also love
a little chocolate I mean hello shocked
a lot so now I'm going highlight the
face I have been dying to use this I
just got this recently it is the Becca
cosmetics and Jaclyn hill Becca
Champaign glow palette what we're gonna
do is when to go ahead and highlight the
face with champagne pop and a little bit
pearl okay I'm take that same wing oh to
brush and a little bit of champagne pop
first almost brush so much okay let's go
into our highlighting Oh champagne pop I
mean like I've already used chef a pop
like so many times and I'm obsessed with
shopping pop obviously and I'm take a
very tiny little baby amount of pearl
because it is like a pearlescent white
almost and that's what I go on like the
tippy top of my eye
what on the tippy top of my eye light
like right we're like the light would
hit like the actual cheekbone right
there and that's it because I feel like
if I go overboard I will be shining
from outer space which is fine like it's
fine but I'm not trying to cause any
accidents but blushing to yous guys
a swarm soul should stick to what I know
yeah warm so it so I'm gonna take a
morphe brush and I'm going to run some
warm sole on the cheeks just I want like
a little bit of some summon but I don't
want a lot of blush on to be honest I
want to be more like on the bronzy side
and this color is great and mixing in
like your bronzer with your highlight
because I just have a little bit of
glisten to it yeah but I was saying is
I'm so excited for Halloween because I'm
gonna be Snow White and my friends
Patrick and Nikki are gonna be what
they're gonna be and it's just gonna be
so funny I'm so so so excited and what
do you ask me following what the hell

want to know it's why you guys gonna be
for Halloween because I am so excited

gonna be taking hula and my maked geek
chisel cheek brush my favorite
contouring brush just kind of contour a
little bit more with hula dance come to
Kolkata bitch the what the I
forgot I guess on her is nose contouring

process did you look so up so
that you really can okay also what color
missus is good because I am done with my
shows right now I'm like so caught up on
literally all my shows right now I'm
done with arrow caught up flash caught

give it with murder I'm caught up on all
my shows and I need a new show to watch
because I need like my nighttime routine

recommend me a good show perfect so the
face is done I'm gonna go ahead and
start on the ice now let's go and get
into these eyes authorial the faces well
covered and rodeos let's do it so
actually kind of went ahead and did an
eye off of camera because I really
didn't know what I wanted to do I was
like um so let's kind of hope for the
best and I just kind of was playing with
some colors and stuff like that so this
is a look came up with is what I'm gonna
film first things first
we're gonna go in with the beaches and
cream and by makeup geek which is my
favorite transition shade of all time
it's just absolutely perfect it's like a
very beautiful neutral like peachy nude
the peachy nude shade it's just a
neutral transition color I use it for
everything
and I'm gonna take it on a morphe 27
which is a really big fluffy brush
really great for giving me the trends
soon they won't it's great it's great
for what I want we're going to put that
into the crease put into the brow bone a
little bit it really doesn't matter
honestly look it's gonna be so like just
chill and easy don't even trip don't
even let me about it so now I'm going to
take cherry cola which is a new makeup
geek matte shadow Simon really wanted to
try the new mats so I'm using two of
them today I'm excited I'm going to take
it on a more feet 18 which is that
berries just like tiny like fluffy
pencil brush and we'll run that on the
lash line I'm just gonna kind of build
up the color and taking it out slightly
to make it like shadow we see a nice
shadow wing going on right now take a
clean brush just to kind of blend away
the edges I'm gonna take the wing Gus
0/6 I'm just gonna kind of blend out
those edges this is a great brush to
blend because it's so soft so now I'm
gonna take a Wayne Goss 0-5 brushes like
this cute little pencil root is so cool
and I'm gonna take Americano
which is a new matte as well and I'm
gonna run that close to my lash line
closer than I have the like really warm
cherry cola shade this is a very just
deep rustic brown I got I remember when
I was a waiter and oh my god I had a
what make Americanos in and it was
not cute I was actually a pretty good
waiter to be honest what I loved about
it was the money I had that money I had
that coin girl I had that point I had to
crash on me at all times what I hated
about it was like when people like
thought of me as like their servant and
like I'm your server sweetheart I'm not
your I'm not your bitch
don't make me spin your food I'm just
kidding I'll never do that oh my god
it's so disgusting but you know what I
mean like I feel like sometimes like
people don't treat waiters like they're
humans and it's ridiculous like it's
seriously ridiculous it's like bitch
like no don't even try me I'm just kind
of building up that Marikana color sorry
I'm like so distracted by talking I'm
like such a talker and blending with
that clean brushes I go so I'm gonna
take a little bit of corrupt by makeup
geek which is a black I'm gonna take it
on a wing Gus 0-7 which is a super small
tiny pencil British and that's in the go
on my lash line which is like a really
just intense black close to the lash
line closer than all the other ones
honestly guys you can totally use that
tape the tape method for this if you
want like that's totally gray it
probably turned out so much easier than
me free handing this bitch but we all
know I'm an extra match on that oh six
pressed by Wayne I'm gonna take a little
bit beaches and cream and americano and
cherry cola mix let's just mix them all
Doug life so I'm actually gonna just run
that on the outer corner just to really
in
sure like the ultimate blending let's go
take a morphe gel liner this is in the
shade slate and I'm just gonna kind of
make our wing this is gonna be like the
outline of our wing so we can start like
making a little bit deeper you know on a
sigma yo six going in with a more stiff
brush I'm taking the makeup geek pencil
brush and a little bit more of crufts a
black shadow I'm gonna kind of run that
over the morphe gel liner just kind of
blend out the gel I just kind of make it
more smoky you name the liner I made is
kind of like my guide like using the gel
it's kind of like my guide to where I
don't want to pass that's why I'm saying
like if you want to use tape be my guest
cuz it's probably gonna be a lot easier
than what I'm doing of course have to be
the extra bitch and like go do like the
hard now taking this gorgeous pale
gold intensely reflecting shade that
shall be named later on I'm gonna go
ahead and highlight the inner corner of
my eye with this just gonna be a really
cool intense like reflected shade I'm
take a little bit on the brow bone as
well a very tiny amount of it because
this is very intense kind of highlight
the browbone a little bit taking any
nude gel liner for the waterline I'm
gonna take the tart and a rim liner it
is like just clear nude one really great
one I really like this one a lot
honestly it's fantastic but that in the
waterline and then taking americano and
cherry cola mix I'm gonna take that on
the bottom lash line just gonna give me
some powder to outer corner dimension
you know the bottom lash line needs some
dimension - we can't just leave it for
the top when you do on the bottom till
and then on that same way no.5 I'm gonna
be taking beaches and cream just to kind
of blend out of the bottom lash line I
want to keep it that like harsh it's
like so intense right now let me just
kind of blend it out it's like a little
pencil brush blend out your harsh edges
because no one likes a harsh bitch you
know person that we have the shadow part
of the eye done I have nice little like
outer corner smokey eye going on facelet
and then a little bit of dimension on
the bottom half of my eyes I'm gonna go
ahead put some mascara on okay great so
I went ahead put on the other lash off
of camera and put some mascara on the
top mascara I use is roller lash by
benefit and the bottom mascara I use is
the example a giggle a Mac favorite
mascaras like this pairing like that is
perf and then for my lashes I'm using my
favorite lashes of all time the bella

will be did for the tutorial well really
get ready with me so I'm gonna take Mac

favorite lip liners for fall time it is
it is so nice I'm obsessed with this lip
liner and they're so creamy Africa how I
forget sometimes that I'm not using like
a lot of Mac lip liners how creamy they
are and I'm like oh my god I like
dealing with my line if you like to
overdraw overdraw your lips if you don't
don't
personal preference 100% I love a good
overdraw mmm gives me so much life and
if I the lipstick I'm gonna be taking
