on Instagram so there's that he did
follow your elbow
I provided I Twitter I listen to your
music just are trying to fuck my man the
question I mean that's none of them
before you use right yeah we're both
club makeup the way that we talk is like
very drag sometimes so as a drag world
we refer to people as she or like doing
someone who she's she better worrying
like yes honey it's just terminology and
we're probably confusing the whole world
but but program we're guys hi women
that's not only I'm Sheree but yes girl
that wasn't a question but the fact that
I love that yeah the fact that you found
a Nathan you better ask him out on a
date yeah Ethan that's something that
you guys do I mean you look like 12
submit but I'm scared
let's go to movies go bowling class go
bowling oh my god honestly I've always
wanted to fly just like it literally
just flying that meets up in it up I
don't know anywhere and you're gonna go
forget the airplanes I just want to go
in the air and
an island and that's it hell yeah I
would mine would be telekinesis I would
be able things with my mind then I can
justify it I want is come on with myself
my hair you anything that music right
how did you guys become such good
friends like how did you guys meet oh my
god we're lovers me second blow baby
okay so where do we first day we met at
Fame Expo yes no wasn't me so it was a
bit was it I'm s it was a makeup
convention let's make a mention because
we everybody see each other a lot we had
seen each other in passing I think once
I do I'm passing and I'll just like I
just saw him passed by me I was Jerry
start like and I knew who he was but I
didn't like we didn't connect on that
first time us yeah but the second time
you ran on a sausage booth yeah my god
yeah we all went up we went up to you
guys I was like oh my god hi and like we
yeah actually man we had a burly man
we had a moment and I knew right away I
was like I like this later that night we
69 it was that body that's a good
question I mean honestly I used to be so
shy I know that's shocking to believe
were you ever like a little boy I was I
was big we were both were like I'd sure
like we were really introverted I was
very very introverted growing up when I
was a little boy and I was like and
makeup was not like my journey in the
beginning you know any like makeup was
not something I was interested in I was
just very shy and introverted yeah I was
a child so honestly like for me it was
more like I was just growing up like
growing up really helped me you know
like I can't explain to you like oh
that's your journey like this is when it
can happen for you so that was my
everyone has a different experience
everyone you know yeah I just one day
just clicked in my head okay yeah I want
to just express myself not hear what
anyone thinks and just go to school and
I was a 9th grade black eyeliner and
everyone was like oh okay I see you girl
so I just did me and I never looked back
so just always stay strong and never
listen to anyone else to say and do you
honey
yeah do whatever you want to do honestly
that's all that matters is like doing
you hey guys you're like literally with
my Queens
oh I'm firing mic artist and youtuber
how did you guys come to where you are
today with cosmetics in YouTube okay
that's a great question the thing is
like what they asked you can't go back
and you're like okay so that's that was
the question yeah we get to where we are
right now
YouTube in our career not ever giving a
fuck being fearless letter letting no
one ever tell us know right that was a
big one actually staying true to who you
are yeah you know no matter what anyone
says I managed me the same person from
day one and so if I since I met him I
hope this is just me from day one so
named you know I think if you're
authentic people definitely will
recognize that and you just have to put
yourself out there I think that yeah if
you as long as you're doing stuff that
you like to do yourself and like you're
putting yourself out there being
authentic being who you are and not
caring what other people think people
gravitate towards that kind of thing and
they want to see like oh like they're
being authentically themselves and
they're doing what they're doing and
loving what they're doing so they're
inspired by that so that's what I would
say is just keep doing what you're doing
being yourself don't let anyone say that
who you are isn't good enough cuz you
know it always is and ps4 maker was
really cute so yeah better blend honey
would you come point Cinnabon delights
or makeup whatever I live without
Cinnabon
Oh makeup first of all even mani was
like cute together we like ask you
second of all makeup or cinema on the
lights why would you how dare you I mean
I love cinema lights I do know I would
have to go to makeup yeah obviously
makeup that's obviously I can eat makeup
I can eat a lip scrub I could eat a
lipstick yeah you're fine we're fine
yeah I mean we love him obviously love
cinema delightsome but amazing but make
your thumbs first makeup on there how do
you guys say so positive all the time
when people are just bashing you guys by
the way I love you guys another speech
oh let me guess your name
that was how yeah I say I think the
crazy thing about hey is like when you
get a hate comment or something system a
negative you it almost drowns out the
positive all the positive so we're it
how it does that it's bizarre what our
brains do but there's just so much love
on every social media platform and now
and thousands of comments every day and
you know it's like over a million people
watch us and it's just so crazy that
that's even like a thing FA I know it's
insane so it's like the good always
outweighs the bad and we really try not
to focus on that type of stuff cuz
that's not healthy and people that
aren't gonna like us they're not gonna
like us right the good will always
outweigh the bad on social media I think
personally of course we're normal we
have our moment so we're like and like
we have like well like out I go have
other outbreaks or whatever the hell but
that's just a human thing and that's
just how it is like we're both human and
we get we have bad reactions sometimes
to negative things like just human we're
just you got that yeah people forget I
like youtubers we're on camera and you
doesn't mean we don't have feelings like
everyone else yes
I wish more people would remember that
like honestly just focus on the
positivity there's so much more in the
whole world
so more positivity in the world and so
that's what I try to do and same with
Jeffrey I'm sure amen would you rather
never be able to fill in your eyebrows
again or never able to wear fake lashes
again Oh eyebrows honey don't play me
why have none I think Manny without
makeup his browser honestly already

answers oh well yeah I can't you can't
