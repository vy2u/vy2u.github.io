love should be celebrated the whole
entire year rather just like having one
specific day for it but I think it is a
cute holiday and I wanted to do a look
inspired by like a soft romantic night
out kind of thing this is like a little
it's a very just easy to do it's very
appropriate for dinner time it's just
very pretty and if you want to catch
your man or your girl like checking you
out this is the look to have own as

I'm Manny Manny MUA and what with my
channel but yeah it's going to get into
this soft romantic Valentine's Day look
bye
okay so let's go ahead and start this
tutorial of bare-faced right now nothing
on my skin mmm-hmm
valentine's Day is such a fun like
holiday it's so great from you know
obviously for couples I mean if you're
single as much as I love Valentine's Day
which I do I've never actually
celebrated Valentine's Day with a
boyfriend before it's kind of sad is
that like side of me because I've never
had like an official actual boyfriend I
love you guys know this but I like this
videos and be real sentimental because I
mean it's Valentine's Day why would it
not be filming Smashbox primer water I
don't know man life has done me unkind
in the love Department I suppose but you
do what you got to do I guess I want to
be taking the magic Lumi cushion by
L'Oreal I've been really liking this
foundation a lot lately and then I'm
going to be taking that on a e-40 for
buy more fetus tonics I think this is
kind of similar to my no mirror makeup
challenge video because this is all like
already here and setup and just kind of
buff that all over the skin it's all
good if your face doesn't match your
neck because we will deal with that
later I'm going to be taking the cabinet
quanta sensual skin enhancer in the
shade sx0 - I really wish I had sx0
one because that's like the lightest one
and I wanted to go real high lady today
but I choose you're not freaking do for
today and we shall put that into a very
very tiny amount honestly a very very
little amount goes a very long way with
the central skin enhancer like heaven
'upon I love this product it's very very
thick so you want to make sure that you
do set it because it is full ass
coverage as you can see like I'm not
getting like we give them out I'm
putting it's like ridiculous this is
like a oh my god I don't even know who
does want to be how I did as for
Valentine's I know I do if I'm not
getting your attention from across the
room there's a problem whatever I left
on the finger I'm just gonna kind of
press that bitch in and then taking a
little bit of the benefit shy beam I
love this product so much I want to be
taking a couple swipes of that bad boy
just to kind of also kind of luminate
the under eye a little bit more and make
it a little more pink I want to do more
of a pinky highlighter today because I
feel like my makeup is gonna be more
pink you know and I like to on
yourself
and as you can see it's a little bit
more about a pinkier like undereye it's
not so yellow and I just really love how
bright looks and intense but it's still
like really soft and pretty
I don't know I don't want the homes lame
I just like how it looks but we're gonna
go and set that with the laura mercier
translucent setting powder Beauty
Blender set the under eye because you
are going to have to with this concealer
I promise you you will crease I know you
don't want to be on a Valentine's Day
dinner and you're creasing
like a creaser okay you don't I just
take a huge 41 by morphe can just dip a
little bit into that Laura Mercier
translucent and we're just gonna do a
very light just wash of powder all over
the face because I am more on the oily
side this foundation that I'm wearing
the lumi it is very beautiful and very
glowy and luminous but I am loyal E so I
need to take that into account
I remember bitch you need to set that
face you need to set that mug or you
will slip and slide and then take you
some of the Urban Decay powder one I
love the HD powder run the brush in the
captious any the lightly just dust that
over the face and then taking any kind
of powder foundation Studio Fix by Mac
for me I'm just gonna run that down the
neck just to kind of match the face a
little bit more make it so it's not like
you know pale the on my neck and
click ball on the face of course now
that we have the base of the guard on a
hasting base I say base so often it's
kind of a crime taking a more fee and 4
3 8 and the Marc Jacobs are you called
Mirage filter 40 I'm gonna take that
yellow shade and put that underneath the
eyes and just kind of highlight the
under eye a little bit you know just a
little subtle thing honest you guys this
under-eye powder by Marc it's beautiful
like holy crap it is stunning and I
think with this powder they have like a
bunch of different shades for like
different skin tones just gonna put this
bitch everywhere yeah it's like a very
lightweight powder I don't know how to
explain it it's just beautiful it really
is beautiful so far bronzer today I'm
gonna be taking the chocolate Soleil by
Too Faced I know it's not freaking it's
not hoola by benefit I'm just trying to
like not be in the same routine
and like you something else you know I'm
going to take a and 5
seven by morphe and chocolate soleil
bronzer and just our bronzing up the mug
just very very I say very lightly like
it's a thing you know I go hand
with the bronzer like why don't even try
to say go very light is fine makes you
go him you go him don't lie oh my god

gravity side chocolate do you guys have
any Valentine's plans so far like that

don't have like a significant other to
share my Valentine's with like I love
hearing about other people's and how
like great theirs was because it just
gives me like hope you know like using
hope that like I can have a good a good
Valentine's Day someday you know I'm
gonna take the Kat Von D shade and light
palette with the mega peak trilogy brush
and just start to kind of go in the
middle shade just kind of do a little
bit of contouring but yeah I really do
want you guys to tell me what you guys
are gonna be doing for Valentine's Day
in my comments I really want to know I'm
really curious
it's so cute like I love Valentine's
it's funny cuz I'll have followers to
ask me like love advice and they're like
oh my god like what do I do about this
isn't that and I'm like I promise you
like I am the last bitch that will give
good advice about a relationship
because I've never been one I can just
like speak off of what I want are my
experiences it's just so funny because
like you guys will ask me like about
your love lives and be like wish I - and
I'm like I don't know I'm actually gonna
go in with an oldie but goodie I'm gonna
take backup wild honey I love this blush
and I'm just gonna put that on the
apples of the cheeks it's a very
beautiful like orange e apricot color
take a very pretty apricot oh my god
it's so pretty it's such a nice color
forgot how much I love this blush
honestly like I was soaked and well
honey like it almost put a restraining
order on me it was so bad like I'm
obsessed so I'm gonna take the art
associate glow kit in gleam which is
like the more pinky version and I'm
gonna take that on a M 510 what we can
use I don't I don't know we're gonna
take a little bit of mimosa and crushed
pearl and we're put that on the
cheekbones just to give us a nice pretty
pinky glow I honestly don't even know
why I like my Cupid's bow when I over
draw like a like why do I
do that
I don't know I don't know taking the
Laura Mercier translucent again on a
little powder brush I'm just gonna go
ahead
and do a little bit of cooking
underneath that quant well wait a couple
seconds and I'm just gonna brush it away
okay cool so now it is time for the eyes
I want to do a very pretty like subtle I
wanna do subtle what I want to
do I don't know I'm gonna go with it I'm
just gonna grab the palette I don't want
to use I'm gonna go with it I'm gonna be
taking the Naked 3 by Urban Decay band
uses palette in so freaking long
actually this one's a brand new one that
I'm gonna case that means they like
custom a did the clinic spray paint on
it I think it's super super cool to do
that thank you guys or minik' feel like
it's so easy to create a very romantic
and soft look using this palette so
that's we're gonna do throw into a
morphe 27 that I know and I'm going to
be taking the shade limit which is a
very pretty just neutral like dusty pink
essentially and that is going to go into
the crease I decided this shade is a
very beautiful just pinky base color and
I feel like that'll look so nice with
the rage of soft romantic look oh look
at it already it's so pretty and not
just gonna go all the way into the
crease all the way in using win wiper
motions just very softly just blending
that out and then I'm going to be taking
a morphe m43 3 which looks like this
it's like the 217 from Mac dupe or like
a Sigma e25 whatever you want to call it
and then I'll be taking the shade nooner
which is this color here it's a very
dusty pink but little bit deeper than
limit color was I'm gonna be taking that
into the crease of well this was gonna
be going a little bit lower right now
we're just deepening the crease a little
bit more nothing to him I just want to
give it more dimension I'm really just
keeping that on the outer corner I'm not
going in farther than that keep on the
outer corner and then we're just in case
that you 27 again and just blend out
that a little bit
isn't this look so soft and so pretty
like I just feel like it looks so
beautiful I just wanna like be
romanticized right now I want to take a
bitch on a date I wanna hey saw
something see often and it's not
something I say often I just want to be
like the daddy in a relationship you
know I'm gonna go ahead and take a em
three to six and the shade is strange
essentially it took a white color it's a
very just creamy beige color and I'm
gonna put it on the brow bone so
highlight the brow bone a little bit
with nice just a matte shade and then
taking a packing brush I'm going to be
taking the shade burnout which is the
third shade from the palette sucker
right here that very just like set neat
peach shade like a peachy pink shade and
I'm gonna put that on the lid they'll
look on the eyes I feel like I want to
go really like pretty and natural I'm
just going to take that and just lightly
run that over the lid I just look so
pretty and so like romantic it's very
soft and like dainty you know I want to
do a wing but I want to do like a shadow
I'm gonna take okay yeah I'm gonna do
that okay come and take me more feet e43
which are they very just flat defining
brush it is a great brush for anything
that kind of detail work and I'm gonna
take to shade a black heart which is the
last shade in the palette it is the
darkest one has to comply with it like
reddish reflect in it essentially I'm
going to be putting that on the lash
line to make it nice and like defined
without being too harsh which is what I
wanted to do
it's like we're tightlining with a
shadow instead of eyeliner so we're kind
of intimidated by doing eyeliner this is
a really easy way to incorporate darker
eye shadow without being too hardcore
you know and I'm gonna take that
whatever I have left on the brush and
just kind of run that out here take a
morphe thirty six and just kind of blend
out the outer corner a little bit with
no additional product just cuz I want to
keep it really soft but still define at
the same time okay so this is how what
you have so far it's a nice just easy
shadow extension I'm gonna take a little
bit of concealer and just kind of clean
that up a little bit you do not have to
do this that if you want to keep it to
start kind of smokey and like soft do it
dude like do your thing but I would
certainly make it a little bit more
clean on the edges just because I like
that kind of look and there just go
ahead and do the other eye only right so
the top so the eyes are basically done
like I am good I don't need to do
anything else with them I think they
look just fine and I curl my lashes if a
mascara on off camera as well so what
I'm thinking is I wanted to do lashes
I'm you can keep this look at just how
it is you don't need two lashes
whatsoever if you want to keep it soft
and romantic like you don't need to that
but I do need to do that because I'm a
lash girl so I'm gonna be taking the
house of lashes iconic lashes I find
this would be a really pretty lash with
this look because I do have that really
nice like shadowy wing effect going on
so I think eyelash like this which is
really nice and extended on the outer
corner will be really pretty apply those
bad boys I wish there's the one on like
as perfect as it looks but it doesn't
honestly like I don't know if I like the
way I kind of click on me I feel like on
everyone else they look freaking bomb
but on me I don't I don't know what you
think give me your honest opinion I just
feel like think my eyes look little
wonky but I don't I don't know I don't
know so let's go into the bottom
lashline really quickly I'm gonna do
something very subtle I'm gonna say me
43 brush and I'm gonna take nooner and
limit mixed that's gonna go on the lower
lash line just to give me some added
definition on the outer corner I don't
want to keep it just so completely bare
down here I still want a little some
Sutton morphe 18 I'm just gonna blend
out that a little bit I'm gonna take the
Mac NW and 20 what's this what are you
me max - yo
graphing pencil in the nude shade and
c15 nw20
I'm just go put on the lower lash line
just to kind of awaken my eyes a little
bit more Mac mascara on the bottom lash
line my favorite mascara I forgot to
mention I put a little bit of that
strange color on the inner corner of my
eye with that same morphe detail brush
okay cool so the eyes are done now I'm
gonna cleanse him you guys in to see
what the eyes look like up close and ya
cool so we're done with the eyes let's
go and move on to the lips and then
we'll be done with the tutorial I just
got this mousseline Kylie Jenner Kylie K
Kylie came with Kylie Jenner's
Kandy K lipstick actually I need to just
bring this up real quick I told her to
do a quick little shout out to Sarah for
sending this to me
you knew that I really wanted the Kylie
lip kit so I can get a hold of them I
can buy them myself and you had an extra
one of these so I just say thank you so
much for sending me this like you didn't
have to do that like as my follower like
you really did not need to do that
whatsoever I'm so appreciative in
grateful that you did so Sarah if you're
watching this thank you so much for
sending me candy cakes I really didn't
want it somebody's it tape and on our
view because I am going to more of a
soft romantic look on the face I'm gonna
go with a more soft romantic lip and I
felt like the candy cane lip by Kylie
Jenner would be a really really good
suiting lip for this loop so I'm gonna
take the lip liner first feels happy
dude you have any musi I feels very nice
heavy duty very very pigmented
like super nice glides on really easily
oh the lip liner is nice okay
cool we are lip lined and now I'm gonna
go ahead and apply the liquid lipstick
this is so pretty I'm never I've never
tried this yeah it's okay
smells like it's mostly good I don't
know
it tells like vanilla he but it's not
like the vanilla I'm used to I don't
know
it smells good though ish oh this feels
so nice and I love the formula ahh oh my
god I'm so happy what do you guys think
of it I think it's so beautiful I love
it gorgeous color it's a gorgeous color
take a deep nude if that was any kind of
similar serenity when I was like what
