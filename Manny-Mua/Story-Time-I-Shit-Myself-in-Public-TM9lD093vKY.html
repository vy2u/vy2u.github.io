today's video is going to be a Q&amp;amp;A video
I haven't done a Q&amp;amp;A video guys oh my
god I am s annoyed but I'm not done in
so fucking long and I've been wanting to
do one forever and I'm like you know
what I'm pre filming right now I'm going
to be out of town I'm not sure when this
video is going up but I'm going out of
town very soon for the two weeks and I
want to get as many videos as I can ten
so that is why this video is going to be
happening we had it's going to get into
this Q&amp;amp;A video I asked on snapchat and
on Twitter if you guys wanted to ask you
a couple questions with the hashtag ask
Manny and I got tons of questions so I
really wanted to answer them for you
guys right now I wish I could do a
snapchat Q&amp;amp;A like where you guys ask me
questions on snapchat but myself I
always freezes when I try to put it on
like public like literally it freezes
and it won't like let me load anything
so I can never really have it on public
it kind of sucks but you know what it's
a fine we're gonna resort to Twitter and
I asked you guys on snapchat so best of
both worlds
you feel me as always if you guys like
this video if you guys don't like me
please don't fucking watch you know Joel
with that but if you guys do like this
video and you guys do like me please
like this video and subscribe to my
channel through already
well yeah it's going to get into this
Q&amp;amp;A video
so why I went ahead and did I just
screenshot it a bunch of questions
someone's going to go through the
questions on my phone and we're gonna go
right into it okay first question from
Carly question is what advice would you
give to my brother who just started
wearing makeup favorite products for men
ask mani advice for wearing makeup if
you're a guy would be just if you if you
like it just keep doing it that's the
thing in society right now we're not at
the point where people are gonna look at
you in a normal way this time look you
kind of like why is he wearing makeup
that's so weird
and that can be kind of discouraging at
times so what I would say if you like to
do it if it makes you personally happy
just keep doing it honestly that's what
I say like what I say about myself like
I love wearing makeups I wear and I
don't care what anyone else things I get
hate every day about it and I just don't
give a shit about it whatsoever so I
love wearing it and that's all that
matters to me so that's the advice I
would give to your brother is if he
likes it and it makes him truly happy
just fucking do it and don't listen to
anyone else favorite products for men oh
I don't know honestly I don't really
have a favorite products for men kind of
thing because I use products for men and
women I use women products so honestly I
really don't know about favorite
products for men because I use products
for women and for men because make it
was for all genders little I'm gonna
clean that makeup is for all genders oh
yeah
Sierra Garcia asks how did your dad
react to you being gay did he always
know ask Manny I've been meaning to film
a coming out video and I feel like that
question is more for coming out video
kind of situation I will definitely
answer that if you guys still wanna see
one I've been mean to doing oh I meant
to do one in fucking January but the
whole palette thing like kind of threw
everything off video wise like I kind of
just threw it off my whole entire like
game writing up some videos but if you
guys still want to see a coming out
video I would love to do it just let me
know in the comments below if you want
to see a coming out video and I'll tell
you how my dad my mom reacted to me
coming out that would be great just let
me know the comments bar below and I'll
get that shit out for you guys or like
the video whatever just make sure just
make sure I know you want to see it like
the video comment whatever m's asked
what was the most exciting part about
creating your pilot making geek what was
the most nerve-wracking
well the most exciting part is the
creative freedom that you get with it um
creating colors and creating a story
behind the pollak I feel like my Pelt
has a story and I wanted to go with that
story and I saw just like it's like my
vision the palette is my vision and
that's what I wanted to see being able
to see
people's reactions are when they get it
and what the public thinks about it -
because I love it Marlena loves it so we
know that we love it and we love it so
much but you never really know how the
audience is gonna react to it or how
they're gonna like it so when I saw that
a lot of people did like it I was just
over the moon so excited about it and
that's what was my favorite part and the
most exciting part and the most
nerve-wracking is all the stuff that I
cannot control I can't control whether
things are being shipped late the site
crashing I can't control us getting in
the pearlized pigments late how to
postpone the palette lunch two months
all those things are the most stressful
nerve wracking so hard to deal with
things I'm not thinking about it for me
I'm thinking about if you guys as well
so it's that was the really hard part
about it I had no control over it makeup
you didn't have any control over it as
well so we're just like that's the hard
part is letting go of the control in
that aspect because you want it to be
perfect and you want the launch to be
perfect and you want everything to go
smoothly but honestly like the world
never works like that so you have to
realize that it's okay things happen and
you move on and you fucking live your
life you know it's not that big of a
deal so that was the most stressful and
nerve-wracking part but we got through
it and now it's out and it's fucking
amazing Chanel number two asks mani are
you a top or a bottom past mani you guys
are so fucking like I can't even handle
you guys like you love to be fucking all
divided business and you want to know
like the true tea the real tea fucking
starting the pot sipping it with the
pinky up tea ah I've actually answered
that question in a previous Q&amp;amp;A video
which I'll link down below I want
something along lines up if I like to
sleep on the top bunk or the bottom bunk
more I sleeping on the boat bunks
because why would I just cut off one
section of the bunk bed you know and I
can have both and I like to do both
Sarah asks any conventions coming up
soon that you'll be attending I'll be
going to fame Expo in La that's like
pretty I'm pretty sure that's gonna be
happening for sure I don't know anything
other than that I don't even know I
don't even know I loved generation
Beauty as well but I've already did one
like recently hmm so yeah for sure
Fame Expo la I'll be there and you guys
better be there too
okay asks what's the one thing that
keeps you going staying so strong
everyday that is a great question
honestly my family is what pushes me the
most
also my followers that you guys really
do push me to be a better person every
single thing make me strong like you
guys I'm not kidding like us
me such a strong person being on social
media like one day that you got from
social media is brutal all the time but
the love you get from it is so much
better and I feel like I can conquer the
world with you guys behind me it's it
sounds weird and you're like what the
fuck like that sounds really awkward but
you can ask any other youtuber that has
millions of followers or hundreds of
thousands or millions of followers or
any or 5,000 or a hundred you feel like
confident because people are watching
you appreciating you letting you know
what you're doing is OK and that it's
good and it's helping them out so it
really gives me a lot of confidence to
continue doing what I'm doing and that's
why I do what I do is because I do it
for you guys and I do it for myself and
I do for my family and my friends and
that's kind of how I keep going every
single day it's because I remember that
I'm not just doing things for me I'm
doing it for other people doing it for
you guys and that's the most important
thing I don't kind of have to explain
cuz I want to make myself sound insane
or anything but I really I do want to be
someone that you guys can look up to and
someone that you can think like hey like
he started here this dorky kid who
didn't know what he was doing very out
of it like very introverted and now I'm
on YouTube just did a collaboration with
makeup geek you know I'm much more
extroverted than I was in the past so I
just want you to know that if you set
your mind to something you can do it you
can do anything these are mine too
I hope that's what you get my channel I
really really really hope you do and yes
I get hate and yes people fucking hate
me to death but I don't give a fuck
because I love myself sorry
Evon asked would you ever consider
moving to LA actually yes and I'm gonna
be moving this year I know it's crazy
like I'm moving to LA this year it's
been like a hard decision it's been
really hard I love San Diego so much I
love it technical is like the most
beautiful place it's amazing my family's
here it's just it's perfect but it's
been really hard being a youtuber and
traveling as much as I do especially
going up to LA all the time driving LA
all the time he'll get me wrong the
drives only like what 2 and 1/2 hours
it's not that big of a deal but when
you're doing it several times a month it
gets so so hard so hard to do it's just
really frustrating and it's just easier
like everything is in LA you know San
Diego there's not a huge hub for beauty
or YouTube or whatever it is that's all
in LA and so that's why I'm gonna move
into LA this year by the end of the year
I'm gonna be up there fully
already if I get it suraÃ­h asks what
was your best and worst highschool
experience um I would say let's start
with the best friend hmm the best one I
would have to say is going to the Junior
Olympics when I was in volleyball I
played volleyball in high school all
through high school and I played Club
and we went to the Junior Olympics my
club team that was really really fun and
I felt very proud of myself because I
was like on a Junior Olympics team and I
was like bitch yes ma'am so that was
really fun I was like really big
highlight for my high school career my
worst experience I would say I think my
worstest means ever was like I shat
myself once in high school I was on the
bust we're going to a game and something
happened like something happened
internally inside me something died
inside don't know what happened I lost
all control and I just fucking shat
myself on the bus right before we got to
the school too so luckily it was right
before we got to school like right as
we're arriving to the school thank God
like it was only in the car for like
literally like three minutes and then we
were getting down and going to like play
a game and I'm like guys I hear back I
was gonna use the restroom real quick
and like I was very calm very just very
composed very just like whatever so
everyone's like cool so I went off to
the bathroom walked like very slowly
until I got to a spot with the nogitsune
bitch I ran for my life I ran to the
stall that poor stall it's probably
never the same I took on my underwear
throw them away burn them to be quite
honest it was just a really bad thinking
how to play volleyball with no boxers on
so that was really awkward because my
dick which is flailing everywhere super
awkward but um that was already the
worst experience my life shitting in the
bus yeah
no one smelled anything though it was
like I was very very composed and no one
could tell and so yay for shitting
yourself great Jazlyn asked if you could
change anything about yourself what
would you change by the way love you man
I love you - jessalyn honestly if I
could change anything about myself
it sounds so dumb but actually changed
more like physical appearance stuff like
I wanna have like a six-pack I want
fucking a nice chesticles
I want certain things like I want
thicker hair you know what I mean
there's just things like that that I
would change there's one thing that I'm
going to change very soon I have these
gaps can you see these gaps can you see
that it these guys on the side on your
teeth they are not that big of a deal
whatsoever they're fucking like they're
little gaps but they annoy the shit on
me because I've had braces for four
years to close my caps and they were
closed and then I got they've taken off
and then the
teeth like Larry just went like me
psyche
I got gaps again on the side so I'm
gonna get I don't know what they're
called they're like no prep veneers or
whatever they just like press on a tooth
like on that too so I just closes the
gaps I don't really know what it's
called but I'm gonna be doing that too
because my parents did not pay thousands
of dollars to close my gaps for me to
get fucking gaps again
well that should I can fuckin like
square water out of that fucking
squirtle up in this bitch so I'm gonna
get those gaps filled very very soon
because they're pissing me the fuck oh
fuck
ah I don't sound that big of a deal with
you guys probably get like many and
never notice your gaps before yeah
because I always talk like this and I
talk to my left side smile gap it's not
that big on the left
compared to my right that is a fucking
gal I got a quarter to that bitch
but that's something I would change
about myself I'm gonna get my fucking
gaps filled shins GN see how fucking
intense I get about the gaps piss me off
Shelby asked meting do you recognise
often when you're out and about and if
so does it bug you honestly it depends
on where I and if I'm at a mall it
happens more often if I'm at like Target
it happens it just depends on where I am
if there's like huge population of
people I will probably get recognized a
couple of times not just like how it is
with YouTube like that's just how it is
if so does it bug you it doesn't bug me
whatsoever at all not at all I love it
when people come up to me I love all my
followers come up to me like I think
it's so amazing getting to see your
guys's faces and getting to put a face
to a name or face to look like or a face
to a comment like it's just amazing to
get a see you guys in person because you
guys know me in person like you guys see
me like I'm here on YouTube you guys get
to see my life but I don't ever gonna
see your guys's so I think it's an
amazing thing and so if you guys ever
see me out in public please come out to
me I love it I'll hug you guys like
we'll talk for a little bit like I I
really do love meeting you guys and I
hope you guys know that and don't ever
be scared to come over to me because I
think it's amazing and if you guys have
the balls enough to come up to me you
know my ass is gonna fucking hug you
like come on come on
that takes some nuts that take some
fucking cojones fucking hair yes donkey
fucking nuts
yeah mate made L made Ellie Mike made
Ellie I don't know how to say anyone so
sorry if I'm butchering it asked what
would you do if it's walked into your
room face like from scandal fit don't
fuck with me like that you know I
fucking be on my knees already yeah
Melissa asks who has been the most
supportive of you
and your love for makeup since day one
um that's a hard question I would say
that I was the most supportive of myself
I know that sounds really weird like but
it wasn't it wasn't easy in the
beginning you know what I mean like it
was so not easy I had to keep going
myself you know my family didn't like
what I was doing they really understand
what I started doing the makeup I was in
college I was about to graduate with my
BS and continued on to do medical school
so my family was a what the fuck are you
doing with makeup and it makes sense in
their heads because that's not like the
journey I was going on or the ones I
wanted to plan for myself since I was
little so they're like yo like that's
like no that's that's not gonna happen I
didn't really get a lot of like
positivity in the beginning for my
family I was like fuck what do we do and
also like when I was on social media I
was trying to make friends with people
and it turns out a lot of people didn't
like me um I found out like later on a
couple months in like in or like they
were like just talking shit behind my
back so hardcore and I was like okay
like I thought you guys liked me guess I
guess I was wrong but I don't give a
fuck what they thought because bitch hi
I'm here now don't give a fuck okay I
kept going so honestly I would just say
myself I was supportive of myself since
day one
no one else was you know what I mean no
one there's no specific person that was
like my like writer died since the
beginning since I was a small youtuber
who like believed in me and wanted me to
continue to succeed there was no one I
had to support myself and that was fine
with me
you know I am a strong person and that's
totally cool but to answer a question
there was not a person in the beginning
who kept me going I had to keep myself
going and if you're starting social
media that's gonna be the case a lot of
the time 99% of time you need to keep
yourself going cuz no one's gonna try to
push you up and keep you going if you
don't want to keep yourself going so I
was my supporters and stay won and yeah
that's what it is
brillante asks about to get real
personal how old were you when you lost
your virginity love you so much daddy um
I was 19 years old when I lost my
virginity a month before my 20th
birthday excited told myself I'm not
gonna be a fucking twenty-year-old and
be a virgin that's just like what I
thought in my mind I was like I want to
be a teenager still when I lose it so I
was a month before I turned 20 I was
like bitch this is gonna be gone today
and it was yeah Oh God was like
and that's it for the questions I'm
gonna have for today I'll just do
another Q&amp;amp;A very soon I had so much time
doing these I forgot how much fun they
were to just sit down and talk to you
guys as if you guys are here with me and
I'm just literally gossiping to you
about my life if you guys have a channel

people to get to know who you are as a
person
and that's what people want people want
to get to know you it's like they want
to pull out the personality from you you
know what I mean so I love doing A's I
love Washington ace I'm just super super
fun but yeah that's it for this entire
video I hope you guys liked it other
than that nothing there's anything else
