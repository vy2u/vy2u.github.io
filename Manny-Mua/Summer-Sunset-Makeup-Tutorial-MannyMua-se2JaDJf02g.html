today's video is a video on this cool
badass sunset e-type I have going on
right now I wanted to do something
different I feel like I haven't played
with like yellows or purples in a while
and I wanted to incorporate that in
today's look I hope you guys enjoy what
you're seeing because that's what this
video is I've been getting tons of
requests to do more different dramatic
colorful looks and I know this is not
like the most dramatic look or not most
colorful look but I think it turned out
really really cool and I feel like it is
a very wearable sunset eye and because
we are getting it more into spring and
summer I wanted to go with some spring
summary type looks do you guys feel me I
think it's been so long since I filmed
it really has a bit like I'm just pre
filming right now I'm going out of town
I'm going out of town I don't know when
this is gonna be I have no idea I'm just
pre filming here for you guys to have a
video I'm going to be going to New York
LA Vegas it's just in the next two weeks
it's in me crazy Drakon I'm so excited
to be such a fun next two weeks but I am
pre filming right now for those trips
and this is what it looks like came up
with but yeah I'm gonna stop for a
blinks I feel like I rambled like a
 crazy but yeah without further
ado it's gonna get into this video as
always if you guys don't this video if
you guys don't like me please don't
 watch you know Joe with that but
it guys do you like this video and you
guys do like me and you get do with my
channel please like this video and
subscribe to my channel if you aren't
already and if you're new what's up I'm
Manny MUA and welcome to my channel and
let's go and get into this really cool
sunset e-type I
let's go and get into this video I
already did my face basically I was like
you know what I've been doing my face a
lot lately I'm gonna just switch it up a
little bit and I have one of the new
more palettes I really want to use today
so I'm like let me incorporate that
somehow in today's videos that's kind of
what I'm doing today just a reference I
already PI my lids and I have eyebrows
done already so that we're just gonna go
in with shadow solely I'm so excited to
using this palette I'm so stoked I
learned this guy today and I cannot
handle like I have to use it today it's
this bad boy um 3500 in all Matt are you
joking I'm so excited to be using this
I'm gonna go in with this shade right
here it's a nice like like a mustardy
Orange it's like a must ready orange
honey morphe 27 and we're just gonna run
that into the crease as a nice
transition shade for the rest of the
shades that we're gonna be going in with
Russia is pigmented right away oh my gun
I'm taking that all the way into the
inner corner and I'm doing windshield
wiper motions as well as circular
motions towards the end or I have a
little bit extra skin to work with out
here this is our transition color so
again you don't need B to like neat with
it whatsoever once we have that nice
mustardy orange shade down I'm gonna be
taking a new makeup geek shadow called a
Tucson's Sun it's just a nice like just
like a nice corally pink shade which i
think will go so nice with my idea of
what I want this look to be um so I'm
gonna go in with the morphe and 4-3-3
and just blend that into the crease
basically right on top of the morphe
shadow just to give it some more
dimension and setting I'm going slightly
lower than I have that orange shade but
still like basically on top of it just
to give it another added dimension to
the look and if you feel like your going
to hand with the tucks in Sun or
whatever color you're using I'll just go
back in with that burnt orange shade
from morphe on the same brush and blend
out those edges to make sure that we do
have a nice gradient in blend and you
should have something like this now the
Tucson's Sun is now a little bit lower
and you can see there's a nice like
orange e pinky gradient coming out and
I'm diggin it I don't think okay so now
I think I'm gonna go in with this really
cool darker burnt orange shade down here
and that same morphe 35o M palette that
she just looks really really nice is
like a burnt dark pinky orange
I'm judging on the same orpheum 4-3-3
brush and
we're going to put that into the crease
on the more outer corner I'm not gonna
go as far in I just want to keep it on
the outer corner mostly to make sure
there's a nice gradient with this look
but I know I want to go with the shadow
because a super nice pretty dark orange
pink shade as you can see is having a
little bit more dimension to it and it's
giving it a more of a like a Firebird
kind of feeling you know and I'm keeping
that lower than the rest of the colors
between every single step just go back
in and blend with ie 27 make sure
there's no harsh lines or edges so once
you continue to blend you should have
something like this so far so now we're
going to take this shade by makeup geek
which is a brand new one from them it's
called fashion addict which is a nice
just purple like a light will happen to
a purple shade on a morphine 36 I go on
the outer corner of my eye so we can add
some more dimension and depth to this
look I want it to be like a really cool
like sunset I like I was saying so gonna
have purple out here give it a different
look
we're actually gonna combine that with
taboo also buy me cookie because I feel
like this color it's not dark enough and
I wanted to be the darker of a purple
and I'm gonna go about 2/3 in keeping
this area completely bare because that's
a br lid shade and you have something
like this so far now go ahead and do the
other hi okay great so this always
should look like now once you have
everything blended out so now for the
lip color I decided I'm gonna go in with
a new shadow by makeup geek called Sin
City and it's just a nice just orange
e-gold that's all I can really explain
you guys it's like an orange gold shade
on a morphe M 210 I just found out about
this brush I've just been using it
non-stop so I'm just gonna load up the
brush I'm just gonna load up the shadow
with a brush and I'm gonna packed up on
all over the lid it was a really pretty
orange e-gold I thought would go so
nicely with this look I feel very
festive I feel like a toucan awesome so
you should have something like this now
once it's all blended out so now I'm
gonna go in with the bottom lash line
you see I kind of finished off at the
top but right now I'm gonna do the
bottom lash X I feel like it'll just
mesh easier together and I ready have
the shadows out so why not you know so
what I'm gonna do is go back in with the
Tuscan Sun shadow one more time on the
e36 and start taking that out here and
basically doing what I did on the top on
the bottom lashline and literally just
combining the two I'm going to take it
pretty far into the inner corner I want
to look like the blend never stop to
just kind of just all of it just go up
together you know so now I'm gonna go
back in with the fashion addict shadow
on a morphe 43 and that's just gonna go
on the outer corner and we're going to
make sure that we just bring out the
nice
purple tone back to it same thing and
then going back in with taboo again the
nice dark purple plumbing shade I'm
gonna do the exact same thing with the
e43
and make sure that the bottom of the
lash line does the exact same thing at
the top just kind of feathering it
altogether making sure that's all
seamless and blended easily that's only
going about halfway in rather than the
entire way in because I want to keep all
the drama and exaggeration out here on
the outer corner and not bring it too
far in then blend out those edges to
make sure there's no harsh lines and
then take a little matte chroma graphic
pencil I'm gonna line the waterline with
that now curl your lashes and put some
mascara on and once you get the
eyelashes on as well this is the final
eyelids and by the way the lashes I'm
weighing are Russian black buy new
bounce um they're really cool actually
cuz they're very dense on the outer
corner and fade in and go a little bit
more sparse as you're going in so it's a
really nice outer corner lash which is
what I was going for with this look and
I put a little bit of the most lightest
color from the 35o matte palette on the
inner corner it's like a matte white
highlight just I just wanted I had that
just giving more brightness so look and
that is it for today's video I hope you
guys enjoyed this I look I know I didn't
do my full face in this one because I
was trying to save some time in from
