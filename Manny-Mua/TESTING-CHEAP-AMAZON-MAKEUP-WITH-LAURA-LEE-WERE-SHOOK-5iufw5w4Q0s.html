milk blur banana it looks like a little
there we go okay like a tracker jacker
okay you're trying to know yes
absolutely not you're trained as well
honestly just Google really quick who's
gotta go in you go in search burn goat
milk primer okay okay primer so for
pores and all that jazz so you can use
it so stop bitching and use it okay so
we have it on the skin how are you
feeling I definitely feel like it's poor
blurring what does that horse look huge
and it's like an oil slick it's so funny
a little accuse from what's right and he
gives me like more about it gave me a
little more voluminous finish the gag
that's a minimizing being very slightly
like but it literally little is if
you're wearing yes yes I don't see a
little different no I see a blurring
primary Behar see no blurring and I
still see thank you we still have pores
normal it's so annoying how nice or
frustrate so I that's my monster that's
her monster we can really easily yes we
have this its skin a macaron so that
rich because it doesn't accurately
I actually have no idea what I'm doing
there's France watching this trying to
slap us silly special edition this is
the ELMO edition okay and basically
again it is I think it's like a CC BB
cream okay actually Q is like polka dots
which I don't understand I'm
polka-dotted - you know it's gonna be
too light for me you're fine you'll live
I'll live it up because I'm a light girl
yeah exactly nice it smells a little
perfume E but like not too heavy
okay this is a plane with this is dark
it's just pure torture with this I can't
this is my favorite little might be
really then four three nine you guys use
code my name you just by the way six
like everyone else no no and no I think
this is better
honestly many anyway better you're so
full crap you can't even see straight
okay I can see is your White House
fucking you know we should have tried
this sponge with it do that Oh God
this sponge came off Amazon one sides
like silly and one side I would say use
silly and then blending it with oh man
okay cuz I think you're disgusting
you're disgusting
it's get so much stuff okay so listen
did nothing for me
awesome it actually emphasizes my
texture and my course I mean you look
going a joke I look pretty bad too
though honestly did emphasize your pores
a literally like it made them big you
guys understand like how bad it actually
looks look how obviously like there's
literally his skin in the product
setting right on top of it and you can
tell you be immensely embarrassed to be
ashamed
using retinol that's how it's still bad
okay
this for me is also flop I would like
for you to try it because literally it's
just removed every bit of makeup off of
my face how much I try that one you
already use this shut up oh please
okay so I have it okay wait let me start
with like this and I was a hobby where
following my video first because I
haven't give me all the energy and now
[Laughter]
yeah yeah this does and then watch how
this literally isn't make it wavers was
that plant with that high I don't know
this actually just what's it like tap
that's what's up wipe yes
oh your skin its fuck alright and like
Lily you guys like some of the nicest
can I've ever seen him can you tell the
product really like setting on top of my
skin no it's like literally it's just
your skin probably usually sits on top
like make it look really bad the
products over here yeah okay so we have
these products athletic all in concealer
from peripera
very pink that actually really cute this
was a England concealer now it says what
and they just velvet okay okay this is
literally the Q's bar I've ever seen
ever
I think it's precious like it mines even
cuter than yours no and in what way 88
lip it's for your lips oh okay this is
literally not expecting I'm knocking
those a dropper no I'm not gonna do this
it makes it so this parts hard guys look
it's for your lips
okay that's concealer that's can see
their flesh or a concealer I'm a
concealer concealer
you know what's so crazy I've always
said it's thickest fuck you love it
you're a snicker oh no I mean so far so
we'll see yeah this is literally like
the tickets consider I never use and
it's so not my color
okay you know what you're gonna try this
on okay this is probably more usually I
don't like like like feels like oh it
it's interesting like it's nothing to
hate like fucking hating on the
concealer and it barely touched you may
say this I hate it I never word again
right like I'm not gonna cry about it
you know I could cry I could cry over
this I do live you should definitely
should do the lip are you kidding it's
fucking on you yeah it's because you're
so pale like literally my hairline oh
this is so different yeah I know that
it's a very interesting feeling this is
the most unique feeling so much it
doesn't I hate that he looks better I
mean it looks really bad on you okay
honestly I really we looked terribly
look like Psychopaths like Aziz terrible
news like it's creasing look at this the
eyes are bad well we often in the Senate
to be fair that's true well you keep
cracking that fast yeah you already like
a trash can feels heavy as fuck when
didn't give any coverage that's the guy
so is it not the guy the next gag is for
you to close your job and we're gonna
try out this it's a Highlander yes Osuna
beauty too soon arm UT oh it's gonna be
pretty though
No
okay so let's go ahead is we're gonna
try this little thing out I'm gonna see
little sponge game with this okay with
this one's actually looks kind of nice
just to torture you with it it literally
doesn't know that my skin's already so
shiny ill Laura okay look at me
using your skin like that makes me
violent stop and look at my cheek
physically look at it scraped all the
makeup off does it show you one more
thing let's try these guys you guys
we're down to our last part that we're
gonna try it we're gonna try different
splashes and spills UV mascara and UV
liner oh my god UV liner and mascara but
do it what do we do here question do we
turn the lights off to see it UV suppose
more so be just bright intense it's not
like glow-in-the-dark okay okay we do
the eyeliner first okay look at my liner
though look at this moment yeah yours
sucks guys it's like dried out okay
Wow it took was me I mean look at that
dang that's seriously is UV yeah it is
wow these are really cool this is
actually kind of sickening of nothing I
know but when you go over the same spot
like pigs off completely I'm really
doing my wing from like a mile away from
me right now so make you swear your guts
Oh glory I'm just go right in let's see
if the skillet really will take you
there okay would take you higher to his
zoos more quiet during my family I know
for once where it's not flopping our
jobs okay when I try it down it doesn't
stay you be mine didn't say you be is it
straight down oh wow one that's a way
too far and that's not a heart Laura are
you fucking kidding me
Laura no I want my might be able to say
monetize that's true so now we're gonna
do my scare site looks like the most
promising idea though this is UV think
oh yeah Oh sweetness I feel like the
Joker honestly this looks like you and
you like start
yeah no I was thinking actually looks
more like you use your channel I'm gonna
take cuz I don't think I've ever looked
better
okay this is the worst thing that's ever
touched my okay this is the worst thing
there's my face okay love that I hate it
great
Wow so this video definitely with a
little stamp of failure on it every
product we tried was a flaw okay
actually your ankle is okay okay guys so
that is it for today's video we tested
all these products literally every
single one of them turned out to be a
full lot so I would say pass on Amazon
makeup yes just keep on scrolling keep
there's no other random shit on there
and you'll want that will be fun yes and
good is that quality we look like we've
been through hell we actually kind of
did yes
