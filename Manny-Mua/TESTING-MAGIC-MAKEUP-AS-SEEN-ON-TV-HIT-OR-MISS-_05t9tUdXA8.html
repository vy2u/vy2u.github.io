today's video is going to be another
random ass testing of a some products
video I actually just really love
testing random shit
these are honestly some of my more
favorite videos to film cuz just fun to
test random ass shit out like I just
really enjoy it like Allah I was
actually in CVS and I was just kind of
like biding my time because I had an
appointment to get some I'm gonna end up
what to get some filler in my face my
boobs right there from it cuz mommy's
looking a little tired people always
like oh my god man you look so tired and
I'm like cuz I am so I got a little bit
of filler underneath mine's whatever I'm
so swollen but I was at CVS just kind of
passing time because I was early 20
point mint and I was passing by the as
seen on tv aisle and I'm like hmm those
aisles for some reason just kind of
really like pull me in to see these like
random ass little products like - they
work do they not I just really enjoy the
acid on TV shit so I was passing by I
solve this and this is magic minerals by
Jerome Alexander this is like a mineral
makeup that is supposed to be magical on
the face it's supposed to conceal and
cover blemishes age spots fine lines and
uneven skin tone it's also do a lot of
things so do a lot of things so we'll
see if this shit actually works it's
like open and see what it looks like
it's like a little thing is like these
little magical crystals inside I guess
these is the magic part I have no idea
other sizes because going to be
obviously testing out this magic
minerals product I see on TV I've never
actually seen the commercial on TV it
was just in the i/o and it says s seen
on TV at the top as always if you guys
don't like this video if you guys do not
like me please don't fucking watch it
you know the drilling yeah but if you
guys do like this video please subscribe
to my channel if you are not already and
if you're new what's up a man um you a
and welcome to my channel thank you so
much for being here I really really
appreciate it
let's go get into this testing of this
magic
so we're gonna open this babish up okay
let's just see what it cleans let's look
at the clean look at the fucking claims
helps cover conceal pimples blemishes
scars birthmark you are a fucking liar
helps cover and conceal pimples
blemishes scars and birthmarks not just
okay okay you know what no hold on Manny
get into the zone you are not going to
be skeptical of this product you are
going to review it and you're going to
be open-minded you're not going to be a
bitch you're not going to be hard on it
you're just going to be open and willing
as if this is a bare minerals powder
it's claiming to conceal and cover
pimples blemishes cars and birthmarks
very interesting micronized mineral
powder talc free comes a little brush to
apply with cool so apparently it's
unique built in color correctors height
skin imperfections instantly has pink
mint lavender and yellow which are all
color correct different things okay so
to use apply it liberally all over
entire face with included stubbly brush
after applying buff vigorously to set
the makeup for a flawless look
okay so feeling it right here feeling
the compact it feels really really
lightweight not in a good way
lightweight more like a cheap
lightweight feeling the mirror is pretty
good the mirror doesn't like it's not
bad it is a nice just classic mirror but
the compact itself feels really really
light and kind of cheap no fans no fans
we have to prime our face okay I'm gonna
be using the morphe prep and set spray
for primer I fuckin love this this is
seriously one of the best prep and set
setting sprays the fact that it comes
out like a fine miss mmm
and then I'm take a little bit of
benefits Porefessional for the poorest
areas like oh my cheeks and on my nose I
want to get this powder a fair chance I
want to do everything that I would have
normally done if I was applying any
foundation we're gonna be fuckin fair
okay so we're gonna go in with this
powder from Jerome Alexander so we are
going to apply this powder on the face I
have a lot of imperfections going on
right now which is my normal I'm gonna
go in with a little Buffy stubbly brush
which is one of those just kind of
brushes that you find out like Rite Aid
in those pack
like 20 and it just like really really
really cheaply made it's that kind of
brush so just that's all I'm like
pressing for you but it sets to use this
when you so I'm just going to dip in the
powder let's see how it looks
we're getting some powder off here we're
getting some powder as you guys can see
right there powder just fall out on the
tray as you can see so we have the
powder on that little brush we're gonna
go into our buffing in to the cheek and
see what we have here this powder also
claims that it's a one color fits all
and just kind of matches your skin
magically I feel like it's picky about
my dry patches right here that's weird
because I just don't have any dry
patches so what the fuck Jesus Christ
I'm like literally going in here like
twenty fucking thousand times okay using
that brush like I cannot like I
physically cannot keep using that brush
I'm gonna use a good one
I'm gonna use a morphe y 7 to really
give this powder a fucking go you know
okay I do notice that the powder is
definitely giving me an even skin tone
but what's the fun picking on my driver
we're not even get dry patches from
That's not me this is my entire face
with the powder on I definitely can tell
the difference between not having the
powder on and having the powder on I
definitely give me a little bit of
coverage and makes my skin look more
even for sure but the claims were that I
was gonna be able to cover and conceal
like blemishes I can still see the
bruise right here like hardcore this
gives you like a maybe a sheer to medium
coverage it's definite some like full s
coverage like it claims to be weird but
it does gonna become a blurring effect
which I kind of like okay guys so final
verdict I am done I this the powders on
me so much excess powder so guys what do
I think I do definitely think that it
evened out my skin tone I think my skin
looks pretty I think it looks so fucking
dry it's because it's a powder I can see
literally like balling up right here
makes my skin definitely look drier than
the Sahara Desert it did its job when it
comes to it gave me an even complexion
it really did but I had it literally go
in like 20 times to do it I learn how to
use like five layers to get into this
opacity I might dude do you really like
just use fucking Studio Fix for one
layer you know what I mean like it just
does
it seemed super practical to me doesn't
look terrible color-wise compared to my
neck or anything I definitely don't
think it'll match a darker complexion
but girl honestly I say save your
fucking coin I'm gonna go and give this
a Miss for me I don't think that it did
what it was going to do like full
fucking covering how's it gonna cover a
birth marks on my face this you will see
so much blue undertone and my just my
facial hair like honey you can still see
my redness popping out from my pimple
it's not it's not what it fucking said
it's not magical I'm sorry I don't prove
this I say save your fucking money go
grab Studio Fix from Mac or go grab like
the pro powder from make it forever cuz
those works so much better
no tea no shade no pink lemonade but
that's just why I donate so yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this video had fun
doing it I absolutely love doing little
reviews they're so fun for me and I just
think that they're fun to show you guys

have thought of or never even thought to
look for or try out but because I've
