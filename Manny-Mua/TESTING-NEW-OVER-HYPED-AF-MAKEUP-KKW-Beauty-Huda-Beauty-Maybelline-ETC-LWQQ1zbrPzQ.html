today's video is going to be a fun one I
feel like I've done this a couple of
times already I'm testing overhyped mega
things that you guys have been seeing in
the beauty community that have been like
really really hyped up that you're like
okay this bitch is hyped as fuck but do
you actually work or not you know saying
so I have some fancy Beauty the new 50
Beauty stuff then you should write k'kaw
lipsticks JLo Inglot Haley Maybelline
gasps oh my gosh
so I'm actually really really excited to
test a bunch of these products offer you
guys I'm just gonna be doing my regular
makeup and it's kind of just gonna be a
get ready slash testing how all this
overhyped makeup and I really like to be
able to see like my first impressions on
a product right away rather than having
to wait and whatnot so that is what we
are going to be doing today I hope you
guys are ready for him are you ready
because y'all fucking bitches should be
I'm a little hyper - hey I apologize had
some chicken I had some cauliflower and
some quinoa that's not exciting at all
I had a parola I was wondering how's it
why am i hyper had if we were Levin it
was wonderful knows our foot by foot and
it was so fucking good I literally was
salivating from the head down to the
toes well I needed shit because this
fucking basement was flooded honey
anyways you guys that's the phase it is
going to be as always if you guys don't
like this video if you guys don't like
me please don't fucking watch it you
know the drill with that you all know
the drill
you don't even watch me if you don't
like me but I appreciated when y'all
fuckers do and go ahead and click a like
on this video you guys enjoy it also
click the notification bell if you guys
would like to get notified YouTube's
been kind of changing shit up recently
and it's been really really frustrating
for a lot of other creators including
myself you've all been letting me know
that they are not getting notified when
I am uploading and that really
frustrates me so much because I do work
hard on my content and putting it out
twice a week which is still really
really hard for me to do because I do
get really really busy I still try my
hardest so it frustrates me when Yugi
doesn't notify you guys that I am
uploading twice a week still and I
continue to do so press delete YouTube
help me sweetness anyways you guys let's
go ahead and get right into today's
video testing up all this brand new
so first things first guys I'm gonna try
out this guy this is a new product I saw
recently and I completely have not been
able had to time to use this time I
really really wanted to this is the
Smashbox photo-finish so chilled coconut
primer water I have used the primer
water in general because it's so
incredible and I love it and you guys
know I love it but Nicole Concilio
actually did a collection with Smashbox
which she came out three different
shades or three different oh that's
fresh oh my god a trio with them and she
came out with different scents and I
wanted to try out a social coconut it's
a congratulations to Nicole again I mean
really have the chance to use it so I'm
really really excited oh my god it
smells so good and the mist is so fine
like means fine like wine very pretty
I'm gonna take a little bit of the
touch' bomb
there's no I fucking know this so much
it's so unfair taja decided and all
these primers in the beauty community no
really don't want playing games with
this plane ramp they're so canvas are
you guys try to get because if you
haven't
why she's primed to ready to go now I
wanted to go in with this new what in
wild I make a cushion a foundation I was
so excited to try this now I grabbed a
couple shades and this stone works I
don't know my favorite okay
it's a little cushion I love little
cushion I'm gonna take the little
applicator that comes with it's actually
kind of cute and I kind of this is a
replicator in here I'm gonna take it and
we're gonna dunk right into the cushion
and I'm taking the shade creamy ivory so
it works it works it works for me I'm
not even really intrigued by this
foundation to when wild hit me up and
they're like hey do you want to try this
out and I'm like absolutely honey they
send it to my house and it was never
delivered so I was like gotta go buy it
like it was either stolen from my front
or it was delivered to the wrong house
so you know what shit happens it's
totally totally my color 100 percentile
so this bad boy has a buildable coverage
SPF 15 and it ought to be really nice
and lightweight and so far I completely
agree it's definitely more of a sheer to
medium coverage sadly not full coverage
or anything like that but it definitely
evens out your complexion in a way
that's actually really natural and
pretty looking without being like
looking too heavy and so far that's a
win I feel like makes my skin look also
very very luminous and dewy lifelike
like it's actually still my skin
much much better than my real skin TB
fuckin age so that's not for the
foundation and I think it looks really
pretty really natural you know me I'm
not like the most natural kind of girl
I'm just not that kind of girl at all I
have to come to realization that my skin
is not that bad it's just not like it's
really not it used to mean much much
much much worse than what it is right
now and I need to be appreciative of my
skin okay so we're gonna take a little
bit of NARS concealer underneath the
eyes cuz I don't have any new concealers
other than you can see the revolution
concealer fuck I totally should have
gone the revolution could see there oh
my goodness that's so annoying I've been
really wanting to try that too I've
heard amazing things about it we're like
a drachma after this I'm here like
natural love natural coverage and I
don't like anything too heavy and too
harsh as I'm full coverage as and then
right so do you way to have you with the
concealer because we're going
lightweight with the foundation I'm
gonna just go ahead and beat that into
the skin blend it in lightly and I
really love this bright under-eye
because it just makes me look so awake
and so pretty and like I could get any
dude I fucking wine which is not the
case Sasa fucking case actually y'all
when the fuck am I gonna get our man
window fuck am I gonna get a fucking
bottle and my friends ask me that tooth
like Laura's always like mani when you
gonna start eating and I'm like I don't
know Laura don't fucking come for me
bitch you know I get insecure about that
shit
I know y'all asked me to I'm single
honestly honestly I don't know why I'm
single I truly think I'm a fucking catch
and I don't want to go is that cocky
mean to say like I don't know anything
on like I don't think so and it's
hailing so I don't have a new powder
sadly so I'm just gonna be taking my Too
Faced Born This Way powder best powder
in the goddamn world I said it and I'm
taking this on a morphe beauty sponge
favorite Beauty sponge ever I'm just
taking some of my favorites say huh
other than the new shit I'm just taking
some favorites like this just sets
everything super super nicely I still
get a really natural finish but keep
some makeup on a lot longer look even so
you can still see like the luminous of
the foundation like the luminosity of
the foundation still peeking through
that's how pretty this foundation is
like I'm actually really obsessed like
for a natural click every day and you
know that shit's not expensive either
$8.99 how do these honestly how do these
drug so ever have to get away with it
okay what's made in China but still like
that's how they're gonna hit I want to
try to connect to make things cheaper
for you all I would love that as you
guys know I have a friend
you know mediacom like the drag okay so
this what the thing looks like so far I
think actually looks super pretty news
even lugging Kutty that face is snatched
I mean not snatched yet it's more so
like it's like baby snatched like a
mini-me snatch rather than a full snatch
we can go with bronzers we can have two
we have two options we have the JLo
Inglot bronzer which I was very
intrigued about or we have the new
morphe highlight and contouring palette
as well which is brand new these both
look incredible the morphing one is
cheaper so y'all know I'm into the
cheaper y'all know I just live for
morphe because I just do they're
everything literati and dawn and debunk
and dub you don come on tape I can't
read I read I'm gonna take it on a
morphe r1 brush and just kind of I
should have known it was gonna be so
extremely pigmented I was a fool okay
we're gonna blend that into the skin
okay so far so good these are extremely
extremely pigmented as you can see like
a little bit go such a long way I'm so
impressed morphe y'all always come from
blood like I knew like I really knew I'm
just taking the more cool tone shades of
this and putting it on the perimeters of
my face and just carving I'm carving
away on this r1 and honestly this looks
super pretty so far truly I'm actually
really shook and really impressed with
these contour powders if this doesn't
get me into Gryffindor nothing will
anyway so now we're gonna go into play
some blush and I actually got this
recently which I was so excited about
let me show y'all something can I use
this once and I wanted to scream I'm
gonna go and take the Kris Jenner X
Kylie this bad boy right here this came
out recently and it was like so pretty
and I was shook and I love the
collection so I love Kris Jenner herself
I think she's like literally a wonderful
but I tried this blush palette
well technically it like a face palette
but I tried the blush in here this bit
right here
all I'm wondering is where the color is
I just feel like this is just not
pigmented enough and y'all bitches know
I live for some pigmentation and this is
like this brush art had blush on it and
that's like the blushes coming up on my
skin it's from the previous lash so that
was on this brush so I honestly just am
NOT blown away by this blush at all the
highlights in it are really really nice
but I think it's a really really pricey
palette blush should not work at all and
not to be so social sheer makes me a
little frustrated I'm like no I don't
like I just no no no I do have another
blush instead we have hmm
oh so this just fell out of my pocket so
I'm gonna but the butter bronzer by
Physicians Formula on the cheeks and see
how that looks
despite being a disaster and broken and
shudder but you already see it there's
more blush getting apply it smells so
good it smells like this like the butter
bronzer bronzer butter blush butter
bronzer how do y'all bitches get this is
smell so fucking good also again it is
another very sheer blush it's not that
pigmented and it's crush and I'm picking
up from the powder and for it to not be
that pigmented from a powder like a
pigment situation is fascinating and
it's a satin finish so that's what that
looks like I wish it was more pigmented
hmm I'm not thrilled anyway that was not
the best six layers later we've got
there oh she's just so far no loss for
me but anyway we're gonna go in high
light now and we have a new product for
highlighter we have the k'kaw Beauty
highlighter pallets these i swatched and
they looked incredible when they felt
incredible so I guess me some ho cuz I
was really blown away by the swatches
like oh like these are actually really
nice and much more intense and gleaming
compared to her other ones our inner
contour kits which I did not like like
whatsoever so I'm praying that these
highlighters are like a saving grace
it's going with these two shades right
here this real effective pink and this
one because I'm a light girl living in a
lonely world this is the story of oh oh
when Kim said that we were going
blinging with the new highlighters she
was not playing oh my goodness are you
fucking me right now Kim sweetie you're
doing amazing holy fuck I had my
reservations about these and I was like
they're gonna be the same as other ones
I didn't think I was gonna like them the
proof just literally shadowed me
was in the pudding you know but the
pudding just took a dump on my face Wow
and I'm taking the highlighter palette
number one which is definitely the more
like for softer complexions for lighter
complexion do you see me shining like a
second time and okay guys well this is
the face so far this is what we have
wins so far where the k'kaw beauty
highlighter palette
holy fuck these are incredible another
one was the morphe palette that was
amazing the foundation was super super
super pretty and natural looking and
just like Gorge the messes for me were
the blushes I'm gonna go ahead and do
the brows on camera cuz I don't have any
new brow products necessarily and then
I'll be right back with more new shit I
just wanted to do more of a fluffy Brown
nothing to him I just really just ran it
through and I primed my eyes already off
of camera so we have two motherfucking
palettes I want to play with and I don't
know what to play with I might pull it
both I'm not gonna lie so I have the
huda beauty remastered or we have the
new Maybelline limonade this is such a
cute little palette to me and I really
really really wanted to try this out
just for the transitions at least cuz I
have a lid thing that I want to try on
the lid dose of colors new age I was
like okay I'm just going to swatch a
couple of these Maybelline one's more
powdery than I was expecting like a lot
of kick back as we can see a little bit
powdery I'm not gonna lie but I think
you can still get a really really pretty
look out of this or we would have Beauty
be mastered which is this fairy here
which is gorgeous as well I loved these
they just look so we're gonna do is
we're gonna just combine a bow that's
what we're gonna fucking it down okay
I'm gonna go and take up a little bit
that lemonade oh fuck oh my gosh oh my
gosh
literally balancing a couple times do
you see this okay this is crazy there is
way too much fallout way too much
kickback
same with the white are you seeing the
snow Wow I'm disappointed
even the shimmers are pretty not that
good like they are too powdery like I
get when there's some powder kickback I
understand that absolutely my palate has
powder kickback like I understand
kickback with powder but when it's that
much there's no reason for the I
shouldn't press harder for example look
at this file right that's when you're
going with demure tapping a couple times
do you see going everywhere yet don't go
away we're gonna take this on morphe M
504 and I'm gonna buff that into the
crease
they're really pretty rose shade it's a
good really nice petal that's so pretty
oh my gosh I love a rosebud you know
they blended really easily dude look at
that again these are blending really
nice has a nice pigmentation not too
powdery I did notice with this palette
though that there are these like putty
like shades
I feel very interesting and they are
such a weird consistency and have to go
weird dent in the middle it doesn't make
any sense and they pick up kind of funny
I don't know know about those
necessarily just yet we're gonna keep on
going in with the matte shades which are
really really nice I'm taking the shade
henna on the outer corner just to deepen
up everything a bit more so far these
mats are so running and I am living for
them even though I really do technically
I already have this palette because it
is the remastered palette I mean if you
already own the palette don't buy it
again of course we're gonna go in with a
smaller brush and go a little bit deeper
and yes I said deeper need 36 I think oh
I know my brushes so good I'm gonna take
a shake corkle and that's gonna go in
the outer corner and really define this
outer corner
okay she's blown out she's blown out the
house we're gonna go and take one of
these guys and I honestly don't know if
I'm gonna take block party in the sky's
the limit and then we have wild and free
so we're gonna swatch actually both
alone they're more of a dry consistency
but it's cuz they have like a micro find
glitter in them mmm we thinking the
purple oh that is so gorge
oh my goodness the consistency of the
shadows is a little odd because it is so
dry but I think it's because it has
micro reflect in it reminds me a lot of
like a Mack pressed pigment and the gag
though is that these are $20 each that
is like a lot of kuan-yin I mean you're
gonna get a gorgeous effect and it looks
beautiful but 20 fucking bills or one
god but if you have the money to spend I
think you'll be so happy with them
because I think they look so so so
pretty let's go take some more campaign
highlighter because that's like what I
my favorite things of this all fucking
dates on the tops of the brow bone we're
gonna take that gorgeous pinky shame on
that inner corner
they don't inner oh my god they don't in
our corner you know open up in a corner
Bugsy the fucking devil so imma go back
in with those matte shades from the Hutu
palette I'm just gonna lightly
and smoky Brown lower lash line just
like I do on the top just to marry the
two marriage is legal for the gays in
all states that why not marry them so we
have a new eyeliner in our midst
it's from dose of colors and it's called
shady and I've never used this I love
when things are named shady when they're
black well it's like a mousse look over
it okay cool so we're gonna go ahead and
keep on applying the eyeliner cuz
honestly I'm a little blown away it's so
pretty it's so smooth hmm I'm not gonna
doing like with gel eyeliner wings
oh I'm livin and I like the madness of
it too it's like goin pretty darn mad if
I say so myself like it's not a shiny
eyeliner at all if you guys aren't into
eyeliners that are in a pond you like to
apply with a brush honestly I would try
this out I'm really impressed how
amazing okay I'm gonna go ahead and do
my lashes and mascara off of the camera
and I'll be right back I love it I
honestly love how this eye look turned
out honestly the mass of the hood of
beauty we master are so so so nice but
about the jelly cream ones not so sure
they just feel so weird to me
I don't know I'm have to go and try that
on my eyes itself as well just like on
the lid just to see but honestly so far
I'm not like living for the shimmer ease
you know I mean it's now we're gonna go
on with the lips and we will be
completed and honestly I just got this
in the mail message from k'kaw beauty
and this is their entire lipstick
collection or so just kind of looking to
hold a nude collection of lipsticks you
are viewing your bones that was gonna be
a living for a new lip collection so
nude one is probably gonna be my nude
because there's three different colors
that's the color of thinning right there
which is still pretty dark of a nude
shockingly so I'm gonna take new one and
nude one which are still shockingly dark
for what like I thought it was gonna be
my thousand use fnt I just realize
didn't use any of it oh my god well
swatch it
okay I already know a little consistency
of the lipliner is very colour-pop kylie
like same exact feel i mean its heavier
and more weighted than they are the
formulation wise very creamy very easy
to guy and gorgeous color I really wish
that they did for lip liners because I
feel like this one
the first lip liner should have been
lighter than this I think this is still
dark for a lip liner for one we're the
plane and then we are gonna go and take
shade number one which is very nude okay
okay okay
I take back my words because it's very
nude been like that cousin Co the
lipstick is very creamy
definitely a creamy creamy finish so I
was really nice pigmentation to it but
not matte by the slightest not sad
either but this is the color with one
very nude like very very very nude I
like that it's super super super pale
like we need to have those pale shades
you're gonna do an entire collection of
nudes like you need to have every
fucking mood in the booklet you know I'm
trying one swatch the 8th nude to show
you guys what the 8th color looks like
it's like a really deep chocolatey Brown
which would be gorgeous on a really
really deep chocolate complexions as a
nude we have mac fix+
matte will it make me matte will see
this is so me like this whole look is so
fucking me I'm sad I'm gonna use Fenty
in this I'm so annoying you know what
maybe I can do an entire video on just
venti let me know so you guys that is it
that is it for today's video that is me
testing overhyped makeup that's super
super super hyper right now in the
community is what she is I honestly
really like how the complexion turned
out oh I like I think that my complexion
like my base looks really really pretty
like I'm really really really pleasantly
surprised by that when wild foundation
and the highlighter oh my god my skin is
like everything I would say that this
video is a win these products are more
of a win there's definite parts I did
not like like that Maybelline lemonade
