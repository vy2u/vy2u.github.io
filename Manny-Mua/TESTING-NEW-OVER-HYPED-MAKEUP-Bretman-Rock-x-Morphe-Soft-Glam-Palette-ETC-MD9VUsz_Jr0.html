really really fun to kind of just sit
down and just get do it kind of get
ready with me slash testing out really
really hype to make up that's going on a
beauty can you right now we do have a
bunch of shit in here I actually asked
you guys on Twitter and a lot of these
products are from Twitter I got like two
honest nasty Beverly Hills bronzer this
off glam palette this was like the most
requested fucking thing we have the Marc
Jacobs foundation in here brett mins
highlighter collaborate with more fini
so just new things like that to do a
full video testing a lot of these new
makeup products have been coming out in
the beauty world and see what we think
are they hit so they missus are they
good do they suck what not who knows
forgive my skin right now it's obviously
like a hella red and blotchy and a
little things going on Yoli came over
the other day and she went to fuck in
and did the extractions on my skin so
I'm still a little fucked up from it but
I don't wanna wear any makeup because
that's like defeating the purpose of
this fucking video so we're just gonna
go and dive right back yeah anyway you
guys as always if you guys saw his video
if you guys do not like me please don't
fucking watch it you know the drill with
that but if you guys do like to feel C's
go ahead and give this video a thumbs up
and subscribe to my channel if you're
not already and you're for you knew what
is up I'm an emu a and welcome to my
channel join the maniac fam subscribe to
my fucking channel click the fucking
subscribe button and you will not you
won't be you won't be sorry I'm telling
you now you will not be sorry sometimes
I have a country accent that just comes
out randomly I can't help it okay let's
go ahead and get right into this video
so first things first you guys we are
going to prime the skin and wash your
hands before you do this we're gonna be
using our hands we're gonna be doing a
lot of this we're doing a lot of this a
lot of fists I seen like that girl that
like uses her nails and goes like this
all the time and she's like I love it so
we're gonna go in with the new touch'
silk canvas primer I mean literally
wasting what it is it's a primer it's a
base it's a filling base it's like
basically a nourishing base with soap in
it to be really really hydrating and
protective made in Japan so you know the
bitches looks this retails for $52 I
believe it's a really pricey primer but
Tasha has a very luxurious friend we're
gonna do is we're gonna take the little
scraper it came with and you're supposed
to scrape along the surface and once it
hits the line that's them that amount
your chose to use but I'm assuming
that's for a girls or when going a
little bit farther back that man whoa
that's the whole face you oh my god it
feels rich Oh bitch it's actually really
heavy because it is more of a intense
cream but it glides really really easily
and of course this is supposed to be
poor Billy my skin is looking very very
ready for makeup like for sure my skin's
fucked up right now but I can tell it
feels very nice very luxurious it has a
little bit doesn't stick really no
tackiness to it but I'm gonna try this
out and see how well we think so far
going on it felt incredible so I'm
actually really excited to play with
this a little bit more so now we're done
with that we're gonna go in with a
foundation of that one of these two
foundations that just launched we have
either the Marc Jacobs a shameless
youthful look 24 hour foundation or we
have the Dior forever undercover 24 hour
full coverage foundation these guys are
here so honestly the Marc Jacobs color
selection was not my favorite I was
actually really struggling with the
colors so this could obviously not be my
color and it's probably won't beat but I
promise you this was the closest match
that I had to my tone this is in the
shade
white 210 and I swear when I squirted it
out it was yellow bitch if that's not
yellow I was like Miss go I just look
like we have some liver disease it's
fine so we're gonna go and just put this
onto the skin and we're gonna see how it
works for taking a Beauty Blender also
we have a little coverage on okay so
this is actually a very lightweight
foundation much more lightweight than
like the remarkable other things like
that Marcus has come out with he's come
out with that like full coverage as
foundation that's like
Matt finish this is not that this is not
that wanna see this matches that's a man
Oh shucks at first but nothing you know
we have to go in with the brush we're
gonna be taking more feet m-43 9 we're
applying it with a brush not you guys
because I needed to get more coverage
off of it usually using a beauty sponge
you won't be getting that much coverage
but we needed more
it smells like SPF cuz it has SPF 25 in
it okay so I have it on the skin and I
definitely built it like a medium
coverage it's covered a bunch of stuff
but not everything of course you can so
see I have redness and whatnot and pull
a bit more on the forehead but the
problem with this is I feel like I'm
using so much product I've literally
done like three intense squeezes or Mike
honey there's already like not that much
product in here and on the bottle it
says reapply every two hours because has
SPF in it and I was like no I'm gonna
set the bitch and we're done I don't
think I like this you're really real it
is beautiful when it comes to like a
little bit amount of coverage and I'm
sure if you're a girl on the go and you
just want a little bit of coverage
you're gonna be just fine
I am also going to go and I don't want a
little bit of carbs I want a lot more
but see this is the thing I'm using more
again okay so what I like about this
foundation is that it looks very natural
on the skin it doesn't look very intense
doesn't look very heavy it doesn't have
that much cover so go saying earlier we
really need to build this bitch up but
it does look very beautiful I will
figure it out like it's a good everyday
foundation but the problem is that it's
not in everyday price so collectively I
don't know how I feel I'm gonna go in
with a little bit of the Dior full
coverage foundation and give me more
coverage that you want and desire I'm in
the shade 10 I'm gonna try to shave 10
like do you know just just kidding I
cannot match it to save my life
that's the coverage right there that's
what I will only believe it's been 11
minutes so I'm only done my base like
that's wild and so we have so far it's
getting a little bit this looks like
honestly I think with both the
tarnation's and mixed looks really
really pretty
Marc Jacobs by itself was very beautiful
by it I just don't think it gave me one
enough coverage and it's definitely much
more of a like everyday foundation look
when you don't want to do something like
extravagant like this is not really a go
out foundation the Marc Jacobs one that
you are forever give me much more
coverage and looks a lot better and I
think that combined they look fantastic
I would say this so far the door forever
foundation was the wind the Marc Jacobs
one it was really pretty for that price
point I wanted so I just joined the
bachelor nation I'm a fan of The
Bachelor I just started watching it this
season the wolf crystal in it and Arie
and everyone say this is like the worst
season ever so I'm gagged because I
still liked it so I
imagine how good the other seasons are
gonna be when I went after now we have
the base at what it is this is the
foundation on so that I wanted to try
some concealer fuck I don't know which
one to choose I have the new shaken bake
which is like a powder to creamy
concealer and then we have the new Laura
Mercier concealers I don't know do a
separate video on this if you guys want
to see me do a separate video on the
pure shaken bake this is like a powder
to cream under-eye concealer the three
starts as a powder turns into cream let
me know I can tell make that happen
but for now let's go and try the new
Laura masse flawless fusion ultra
longwear concealer okay it goes on night
wow this smells really strong okay I'm
not into this no whatsoever with a pink
one okay so a little bit of pink Renuzit
we are going in we are blending out this
new concealer by Laura Marcion I mean
the coverage is there it's definitely
not as like full coverage as other
concealers I've tried but it is a nice
amount of coverage for sure it's like a
nice medium to full I don't know we're
getting to work in there we're getting
the full honey oh we are getting there
now that I'm looking in the beef I know
my oh we are folded it supposed to be a
very long we're like long-lasting
concealer so we shall see what that
means okay honestly it looks really
pretty to me like it actually looks
really nice you can still see a little
bit of the blue hues in like my inner
corner right there but for the most part
the coverage is really pretty the finish
is really pretty has like a nice dewy
luminous finish almost which I wasn't
expecting for it to be a long wear
concealer I wasn't expecting at all and
what I am noticing this is the gag is
that it hasn't really creased on my
under eyes yet and you all know that I
am a Creasy creaser crease äj-- and me
are like so where they are together and
decrease okay we're gonna start under
anyway because that's something I always
do when I need a bit of fair shot so
we're gonna set our under eye I'm really
show good it's not creasing yet why the
love all right I'm just I just had a
moment because that was like that has
never happened to me where it lasted
that long
there's no creasing good I'm shook for
sure and to say I'm taking my morphe -
classic large powder brush it's amazing
and I'm taking the Too Faced Born This
Way powder it's my favorite powder like
I think of all time so
there's that ok honest and my face is
looking fucking beat like honestly I'm
shocked because I just didn't expect
everything to work as like good as on my
she's full coverage this this girl is
full coverage now the word face is set
and we're beat God we're beaten to the
ground beat to the fucking Oasis we're
gonna go ahead and bronze up this skin
I'm gonna zoom in a little bit what do
y'all think this is the skin this is
what we have it out so far I think that
we look poreless and actual perfect oh
my god it's the fucking primer I bet
okay I don't know I have to use a primer
again and see what we think about
honestly like what's up or what is what
I've never heard of a poor not in this
fucking world honey okay guys so now
were you going with some bronzer out I'm
taking the new honest I smell hills
powder bronzer in the shade rosewood is
what she looks like right here honestly
I really didn't know what shade to go in
with I just saw rosewood and I looked at
all the bronzers it looked like the
lightest one to me so that's the one I'm
just gonna be taking but honestly the
colors are really pretty
it has a very cooler undertone but it's
still not cool like where you're like
dying where you look like where you look
like your corpse II it's definitely not
a corpse II color for sure it's so has
enough warmth and in to make you look
like snatched what are you seeing if the
color I think it's very beautiful
after you think it's going on very
nicely as well it's not looking patchy
like so far so good
actually no the undertone of this is
actually much warmer because now I'm
putting on my forehead and I can see
like right in front of me Gunnar's one
of this is very warm it's not cool toned
but it's not so warm why I feel
overwhelmed I was like oh she's warm
more you're thinking that fucking cool
tone with the look hmm Who am I this is
what the bronzer looks like I feel like
it's very beautiful it's more on the mad
sign mmm actually has more of a satin
finish to sorta looks like right here
what i swatched with one swipe you can
see it's definitely I'm definitely more
on the warm side for some reason on my
skin and those areas it was looking
really cool not at all anymore very
pretty that one was a win for me I think
it looks stunning on the skin and I feel
like it's one of those bronzers that
doesn't go on to powdery it's literally
just like a beautiful like wash of color
so we don't have a new blush so I'm just
gonna take any of blush we're gonna do a
little bit of dish I'm taking my turn on
a morphe for fantastic everybody use
this don't sleep on it now I'm so
excited because our gonna be taking the
morphe x''b roetman babe in paradise
highlighting palette fuck I'm so excited
for Bremen look at this stunning this
look at this look at her I've already
swatched a bunch of as you guys can see
cuz I was so excited when I got this in
the mail so this bad boy
which is 3:13 which is really coming up
holy crap and I believe it retails for
either 27 or 29
I cannot remember and I can't ride the
bitch anymore what and actually comes
with its own fan highlighting brush
which is so cool I have no idea where I
placed the brush I'm so sorry
I took this traveling with me to Utah I
never wore makeup there so I never
actually used it but I didn't take the
brush with me because I don't really
like fan brushes for me personally I'm
more of a like hiking brush like this
this is a morphe art 36 I like brushes
like this dude tell me that morphe it's
not picking it up with this like this is
stunning
I'm sorry but I just say this is
beautiful and the whole vibe I love the
vibe I love the babe in Paradise the
drive ins from Hawaii and it's so cool
and it's like Aloha Mahalo for
supporting your favorite baby paradise
oh my god Bobby I love it it's so cute I
think it's amazing and I'm gonna go and
just go in with this guy I wanna take
the shade vacation from inherent cheeky
cunt and I love you forever bitch I love
you for it now we're gonna take a little
bit of get laid hunty
oh we're doing all that mm-hmm so like
this is just so qualm so proud of brett
man I love Bremen's so much he's always
been the sweetest to me I know so funny
cuz back in the day like so so long ago
I remember he dared me it was like me
trying at work and I was like you are
what this is like Beverly like 4,000
followers it was like the cutest thing
but anyway up to these are four more of
the shades were here they're very
beautiful they're very blinding do you
like they're really nice morphe like I
can't leave they're a whole entire
highlighter range to drop because truly
they are stunning and I'm really really
really excited for them bright mins
palette launches on the 13th Oh
congratulations Brett man I'm so excite
a few babe like this is gonna be so
great and I know it's gonna slay and I
love how it looks on the skin okay so I
don't have any new brow products or
anything like that so I'm gonna go
finish the brows off of camera and I'll
be right back so now guys what we're
gonna do we're gonna go in with some
pallets so I have to hear that I got
requested we have the soft glam - toss
this was the most requested and I also
have the new Too Faced
wife's a festival huh looks like yeah
but that would be really interesting so
I really wanted to try them both I've
actually used the soft glam before so I
don't know why somebody bore us you may
use except books you already use this
I've not used this yet i swatched a
couple shades which were so nice like I
was shocked at how nice some of these
fucking two-faced ones where I was like
oh anyway you guys this is the honestest
yep
right here beautiful shades gonna take
that and then this is the life's a
festival palette from Too Faced this is
what she looks like right here of course
more unicorns woohoo so I'm like so like
over the unicorn thing not gonna lie
this is what looks over here and
honestly some of these shades are pretty
incredible look I'm gonna swatch some of
them where I was a little shook like
they pick up a fuck ton and they go on
real nice like that's really sickening
see what kind of look we want to do you
guys what kind of look do we want to do
what kind of look do we want to do so
just so they go and we're just gonna
have fun I have used the anastacio
before it is beautiful and it is very
very very pretty
however there's never these shades y'all
are so pigmented I'm taking this shade
of orange soda by the way they're so
pigmented that it's almost like
frustrating because put a shade down and
you need a blend for fill I'm not
kidding you I'm by the way I'm taking a
more feat m535i literally like my
favorite little fluffy brush it's so
compact but so fluffy but what I was
saying is that it's super super super
intense because you really need to blend
with these shades like a lot and you
need to have a transition shades down
and the whole the whole nine because you
get so much product up on a brush and on
your finger if you're swatching with
your finger there's so much that you
need to really focus and take your time
and blend you need us you need to slow
your roll you need to go on with some
transitions because honestly you want
the shadows to be able to blend into
something yeah we do a halo eye with the
two pallets we're gonna go in with the
Too Faced in the shade fantasy and it's
a like matte purple there's a little
powdery bitch this is a little rough
come on now we're gonna take that on a
more feet r39
really great fluffy packing brush wanna
take that on the outer and inner corners
okay like it's there it's nothing like
pigmented okay we were going there we're
taking it somewhere where are we going
necessarily I don't really know but
we're gonna try how we're gonna have fun
I'll come back into the honest I skip
how it went takes shape mold berry which
is like we're really pretty like
deepened around like a red and brown are
we gonna are we gonna make a look out of
this let's see so this is what we got so
far I'm taking this on a morphe eighteen
really great dense like pencil brush
okay guys so this what we have so far
we're sleeping the middle part a little
open we're gonna be going in a little
bit later and it's okay because it looks
kind of messy right now but it's really
fine because I think
do like a fool like cutting it here
blending and doing like a fool like
weird moment and I know you guys have
noticed because you hasn't been telling
me on Twitter and Instagram on
everything I thought that you've noticed
me really branching out and playing with
color a lot more and there is a big
reason that I'm doing that too and not
just because I want to play with color
more but there is a reason behind it and
you guys will be seeing within the next
couple of months why I've been doing it
and why I've been so inspired to do so
I'm sure a lot of you guys are
speculating why band playing with color
but I'll see you bitches you'll see guys
we're gonna take a Smashbox lip brush
and I'm gonna take the target shape tape
concealer we're gonna go ahead and kind
of carve out all right here it's like
floating pop crease moments I want to do
I just decided know what to do right in
this exact moment cool with this kind of
thing you actually just really take it
slow okay so we're gonna go really slow
and be really really patient we got some
time are you guys wanna experiment and
play with makeup I would suggest trying
this out why not all you need to really
do is take a light concealer and takes
it over the shadow that you already
placed down go lightly above decreases
I'm doing right now me so this is what
we got so thing we're just working with
that purple actually what we knew we're
going with that purple are just gonna
lightly go over that conceal it area
just kind of keep the whole thing
cohesive like right in this area right
here and we're leaving really only the
middle part open okay and now we're
gonna take the shade mystic rain we're
gonna put that in the center that's from
the Too Faced palette what set into the
center of the eye so that'd be really
really cool it's like this really
intense like purple blue reflect I
thought it was so pretty I'm currently
taking a more feet e 39 fantastic for
doing detail work like this things I
need to be a little bit more precise
because it's so tiny like that and then
we're take a little bit of Beaman which
was a golden version it's like a very
very pretty yellow gold really really
really emphasize a pop in the center of
the lid we should have something along
the lines of this you guys right here we
have like really pretty golden blue and
tense ass center what is happening in
this eye I don't know but I'm here for
it so I just finished aside this is kind
of what I want it to be at I think looks
really really pretty feels really cool
but yeah I'm gonna finish the other eye
off of camera and I'll be right okay so
this is what we have on the eyes so far
where I ended up doing was taking the
purple on the lower lash line and adding
a little bit of black and then I did a
little bit of that same on the lid color
right there and it turned out to be like
this I think it looks really really fun
oh I also highlighted the brow bone and
inner corner with Beaman from
the Too Faced palette but I do have a
new mascara to try out bitch we have the
new superfan Smashbox fan POW mascara I
have no idea this is a collab with Lilly
sings but she was on the box when the
Smashbox package arrives when I was like
bitch what the fuck Lilly superwoman you
guys don't know she is and she's
honestly like one of the sweetest people
like I love her like I fucking love her
and if this is a club with her
congratulations to Lilly if she's the
face of it congratulations to Lilly
anything that it is with Smashbox
congratulations cuz I fuckin with it for
you bitch you know I do we need to film
again sometime do you know I just
realized a hole my god my eye bitch this
matches my backdrop pretty fucking
closely ok new mascara a superfan like a
fan but super fan like Fanning of the
lashes so that's really cool it's going
try 200 I like this one like a lot like
it's the bristle part I like that it
really grabbed on to my lashes a lot
problem with this is that I don't feel
like it's like doing anything for the
lift of my lashes like it's not curling
in any way like I don't it's not lifted
I don't you guys can not even see it did
a great job at coating them but it
didn't really do anything for my lift of
my lashes so as I was saying it
definitely fans out the lashes like
first Shore delving does a really good
job at separating the lashes and making
it look a little bit more voluminous but
it's not really doing anything for my
curl and that frustrates me because like
my lashes are so shitty like they're
just shitty and they go straight down
and it annoys me
I need a mascara to be a little bit
lighter for me because I need to keep
the curl as best as I can
that was good on the lower lashes fuck
me well that looks nice cuz your it
doesn't matter with the lower lashes cuz
they all need have to look like curled
obviously but this looks fucking good
I'm gonna put some lashes off the camera
cuz I was like my new thing I wanted try
for the mascara all in all great for the
lower lashes for me not the best for the
top for me because it is a heavier
formula and it doesn't really give my
lash a curl like I needed even though I
curled them before anyway let's go ahead
and do some lashes on the eyes that'll
be ok guys so now we are officially done
with the eye look this is what we have
so far I really like it I love how it
turned out actually I think it's
beautiful anyway now we're gonna go and
move on to a lip and this was really
really popular this whole entire
collection this was the Wet n Wild
gothic collection I really really wanted
to try this out this is in the shade
wicked pink it's like a metallic
lipstick it's a metallic pink so
really want to try it out let us see how
the cubital eggs golden a it's a such a
cute little idea for a collection oh
honey
where'd it go wow that looks good I'm
wearing kids makeup on that on the lip
honestly that's really terrible no no no
I'm gonna go and try these guys I've not
tried any Me's yet these are the new
Maybelline lip metallic lip I thought I
don't really know exactly what this like
what they are this is the nude one sort
a the new one cuz the eye look is pretty
fucking intense oh I want to keep the
eye look to be the center of this look
it's so funny because I feel like I
never really do like bold lip looks I do
a lot more bold eye looks and I keep the
lip pretty neutral and like fun and
pretty
that's just my mean let's helic lip kit
so basically it's to make a metallic
lipstick so we have this side the cream
set right here which is the cream
lipstick and then we have a shadow to go
over it you have a really nice
pigmentation on these lipsticks though
this is a Smashbox lip brush I mean
there's nothing much to it it's
literally just filling in like a
lipstick it's the lipstick of Simonton
fine it's not like anything like crazy
spectacular but it's fine
the lipstick formula itself is actually
really comfortable like I'm not mad at
it whatsoever I can clean up this
fucking lip gosh shit it's actually so
funny how about a I'm with this kind of
thing like I'm so like a lip liner
person I'm not gonna be too hard myself
I never did this method like even
working at Mac working at Sephora I
never used a lip brush I always use
lipsticks and lip liner so now it's
going to apply a little bit of the metal
one whoa the shadow feels insane make it
super super creamy but then it
disappears into nothing so lose that
okay it's definitely giving me like a
sheen for sure
I don't like it the lipstick by itself
was really pretty I thought the lipstick
itself was great but with the combined
whole aspect of this like powdery thing
and just disappeared
flop the lipstick by itself is beautiful
I'm just gonna keep it at this I'm not
gonna try to fucking make it work it's
just a no it's the pink one oh honey we
need to work on this paint okay layer 3
coming up right here three layers later
I mean we definitely built it up there
and with the gold on top
I'm not a fan okay guys and that is it
for today's video we are officially done
with this look oh my god you want a bit
of a gloss the BH Cosmetics X it's my
ray ray lip gloss oh so cute
I just wanna get a little more of
pinkness to it took a rose it's actually
a cool tone rosy color I kind of live
you can still see the cult went
underneath it but it gives it a really
intense dimension I really like the BH
Cosmetics glosses likho lipsticks and
the lipstick that they got they sent me
with the it's my red collection are
incredible like I was so blown away when
I was watching on my hand like holy fuck
where do they come from you know I mean
anyways you guys if that is it for
today's video this is the final look
using all these new products that came
out in the beauty industry I had so much
fun filming this it's been so long since
I know but hope you guys enjoyed today's
video I really really enjoyed filming
videos like this where I'm testing a
bunch of new products I want just to see
what kind of run we get in when it comes
to like these kind of different products
take you guys for requesting it and
thank you guys for tweeting me products
that you wanted me to use in today's
video I used literally so many of the
ones that you guys tweeted me there were
a lot of good products it was a bunch of
flops for me the one that was the most
confusing actually was the Too Faced one
because the shimmers and the like these
guys right here have such a beautiful
effect like they look really really
really pretty
but the mattes like the purple matte was
so dry it literally felt like a fucking
desert in the shadow and I was like this
is not that good it's a look at a hit or
miss or be technically say went on a
saucier palette I love that palette I
think it's really really beautiful it is
very very very pigmented so just use a
light hand with it because it can ruin
you look really really fast but anyway
most of the products here were wonderful
and I was really really really happy
with it
my biggest win was probably Brett mins
anyways you guys I love you so much I'll
leave everything that talked about
today's video linked down below if you
guys are interested checking them out
