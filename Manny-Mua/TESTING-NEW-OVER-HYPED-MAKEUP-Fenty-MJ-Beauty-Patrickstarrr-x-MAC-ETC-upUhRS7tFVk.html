torch at first this is the touch' silk
canvas I need it I saw some weights in
the vent like that's not even funny
like we need to look sickening it gives
me the prettiest finish I think I used
Koch out of my last video I did like
this like testing over hide to make up I
think I'd use torture and not video
table and I was like you're sickening
I would like to try this this is the
petal primer from the new Vlada and
Smashbox collection I I'm a big fan of
combining primers I don't think there's
anything wrong with that sugar this is
this one's more of a glowy dewy primer
oh and I might be a little dark for
me look at that oh that's like gold and
rose gold of course whole collection is
rose gold which is stunning that
actually might be a bit dark
no amazing it honestly on the hand
though it's beautiful I just want to
change my color right now do you guys
see how it's like a different color
beautiful glow to the skin and it feels
incredible if I owe you some other Vlada
stuff - it's all good there haven't
really been any releases I have seen
that a really hyped up complexion
products wise I'm gonna use my normal
complexion products today I got my
 hourglass right here and I got
my NARS ring here I'm gonna take my
ivory shade one swipe down the face
swipe mini swipes - on the nose a little
bit on the beard cuz bitch has a beer
honey honestly our glass goes a long way
it goes a long way take three pumps of
the NARS for now we'll see how fast did
we get with the coverage I want to go
and take it on a morphe and for three
night a quick little pouts
damn I got too much my beard already
there anyway how are you guys doing
today this is a little bit dark for me
of course this is a little bit dark
random so I know how did you guys enjoy
my Moana video the Moana edit I have an
editor buy and cuz you guys didn't oh
I've had an editor for almost for a
couple months now actually and I've been
needing him because I've been traveling
a lot recently like not like in the past
couple months but I was traveling so
much that I could not physically produce
two videos a week and still travel as
much as I did like I couldn't do it
physically I was like I can do this so I
got an editor and he's been helping me
out so much he's wonderful I wanted him
to like trying to do more of a fun edit
form i'ma wanna video no my bitch just
something fun
and I think he really did I thought it
was so so cute let me know what you guys
think I thought I was super cute and I
hope he edits this one in that same way
Anthony you're gonna edit it in the same
way because I thought it was super super
fun and I really enjoyed it and I think
that that makes a video more fun to
watch I'm more enticed to watch a video
that's fun in an edit like something
that's really really really cute I
already think I'm fun
not gonna lie I think I'm one of them
more fun Beauty people on YouTube not to
chill my own but sometimes I watch some
of these other Beauty people and I'm
like no comment sweetie we're gonna take
some tart shaped ape concealer I don't
see any other new concealers to me I'm
sorry it's gonna highlight the t-zone
good.you I also do have that I'm gonna
totally try is the new fix plus bold
like these are like the new fix pluses
that have like some shimmer and reflect
to it very intrigued about that honey
well you guys the first things first
that is new that I've been dying dying
to try is the Marc Jacobs finish line
perfecting a coconut setting powder
eight grams of product in this bad boy
you look at this it looks like a little
macaroon and I want to eat it but I
would choke before I even get into that
can you talk about the fact that it's
all new at limited-edition rose gold
packaging all the accents are rose gold
and white beauty and grace sweetie do
you want that's called it's called
luxury I'm literally gonna read off of
what the claims are of this bad boy
because it's so pretty and I want to
give it justice this is a seamless
setting powder it's a lightweight
formula layer seamlessly for a smooth
soft matte finish that perfects and
blurs skin and in stand this powder
supposed to really help with keeping
your skin looking healthy and hydrated
and not chalky in any way shape or form
because it does have five different
forms of coconut and cocoa butter so I'm
like you know what that is something
that I want I don't want my skin looking
chalky and I want pretty the color of
this I would say is more like a
yellowish tone to powder so I'm gonna
take it on my little Beauty Blender
we're gonna shut the under eyes okay
that literally looks so pretty
hmm why is that actually burning my skin
though he literally smells so incredible
and this bad boy also retails for 44th
dollars like it actually feels what the
claims say it is it feels very silky and
lightweight and I feel like it's gonna
be a really nice product to layer and
really set the face I like it dude I
like it a lot we have a new good-ass
powder on the block because I think we
do I'm sorry bright as skin is the thing
snaps straight now like I actually feel
like it looks blurred and they my
pores don't look as prominent and I'm
going lighter weight with the powder on
it the cheekbones because I wouldn't go
in with the dewdrops as well that's
another new product that I have I really
from now on we have more newer things so
I feel like that's more exciting you
cannot tell me I don't look snatched
with this powder I'm sorry you can't
what pores where are they I'm looking
for him even on the nose bitch that's
when I know my nose pores have seen
things bitch they have seen some things
and right now they're like taking him
they're on a break they're on a quick 15
minute or and I'm like bitch yes now
let's go ahead and go in with the dew
drop we have the new Marc Jacobs dew
drops coconut gel highlighter limited
edition because it has that rose gold
packaging like I said earlier and this
is in the shade of fantasy look how
beautiful this is do a pump on the back
of my hand oh this is so pretty I'm
gonna blend it out a little bit I'm
gonna use my Beauty Blender to apply it
a little bit goes a very very long way
it's like a gel formula so it's really
really well I could be like really
blinding when you build it up but it has
that ability to be really
natural and like lightweight looking so
that's kind of what I'm gonna go for
right now cuz she's a dainty girl people
thing about this one this is like a
continuation of it they're like
bestseller which was the golden one cute
little it's literally the same exact
formula it's so beautiful it's taking it
on the Beautyblender on the sponge like
it just a quick little stunning moment
you know it's a little it's a little bit
dark on me
I'm not gonna lie it's a little bit dark
so I bet if you have a deeper complexion
than I do probably gonna enjoyed this a
bit more I mean I love it still looks
beautiful I can tell that's a little bit
darker because it has that rose gold
Sheen to it what I really liked about
the last one the gold one was that you
can mix it in with like your body
moisturizer I thought it looked so
freakin beautiful when I did that I was
like oh my god I'm a goddess so I would
go with some blush and I want to take
the Mac X Patrick Starr I'm not blushing
powder duo and has it this really
beautiful peachy blush in here and I
really wanted to take dude cuz it looked
so pretty and I'm like I need this
awesome blush why am i doing blush
before bronzer I never do that that's
like a beautiful like peachy
stunning color I really really like it
oh also with the blush you can't even
tell that the dew drops are a little bit
too dark for me for the cheekbone
because I'm just I'm a pale girl I'm up
hey all got the gold do jobs were a
little bit lighter but down this blush
is nice go Patrick and Mac bitch like
this is a nice as the lush the bronzer
we don't even need an introduction we
have fantastic the fact that tantastic
is even back right now I want to scream
it's literally made me run the whole
time like I oh it's so beautiful oh this
smells like coconut - I love the scent
of this and I feel like this color is
super universal like it's not one of
those clothes that are like gonna be
pretty on just like lighter complexions
I feel like it has a really nice range
because it does have that really pretty
warmer undertone but it's not too warm
it's not gonna look like right on the
skin either it just looks beautiful
I'm turning rosy yes this bronzer
retails for $49 you get so much product
and you get my 25 grams of product that
some dewdrops retailed for 44 in case
you guys were wondering about those as
well I just forgot to say it during but
they launched tomorrow online on the
23rd for 23 all these new Marc Jacobs
products the new coconut collection so
the online retailers are gonna be
during all these goodies the coconut
collection from Marc Jacobs are gonna be
sephora.com of course Marc Jacobs
beauty.com net-a-porter calm even Markus
calm and Bergdorf Goodman dot-com as
well and in store they launched on May
4th at Sephora Bergdorf Goodman and
Neiman Marcus those are gonna be in
store that's where they're launching and
so if you guys want to go in and play
with them I would highly highly highly
recommend it the setting powder already
the bronzer like if you guys don't know
how much other brands are come on and
the dew drops are beautiful this is the
new palette we'll talk about this later
but I'm just really curious Oh oh this
is perfect and Wynton event shine this
is great color scheme oh I live so to go
ahead and make our highlights pop a bit
more we're gonna be taking the Vlada X
Smashbox highlighter look I mean
honestly like you don't even need to cuz
this looks so beautiful by itself it's
stunning but I want to do a little more
pop just cuz I am that girl in that girl
are you kidding me with how stunning
this packaging is I couldn't even
believe it truly flattered this is a big
formula I can tell it's like one of
those for me they're a little bit more
on the dry side but it looks so
beautiful it almost as a pink shift to
it oh my god I don't know what that is
it doesn't say what color it is but it's
the gold one actually did a little
unboxing of this on my insta stories and
Vlada respondent features like yo he
recommended using it wet because it
would give you such an intense blinding
shine more like more so water not really
setting spray so basically I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna take a little bit of fix
plus the new fix plus Oh bug the new and
I have to say that this color is
stunning like this is a beautiful shade
that's stunning flat a good job girl
like this is so pretty
does the camera light I don't think so
boy doesn't right now we're gonna take
the same spray to the next fix plus gold
light basically has little gold
micro-fine pigments and it has a little
bit lower than you
it smells exactly like fix+ like
literally identical which makes me how
because fix+ the scent is iconic me
up okay so now I wanted to take our
Beauty Blender we're just gonna pounce
over it just make sure it goes into the
skin but doesn't look like any remember
how I did it with like my last video I
blot it over just I don't want it to
have any like harsh lines
but luckily fix+ always has such a great
like spritz like it sprays up very
nicely so that's everything okay so this
is the face so far and honestly so far
so good
the only thing I didn't really like love
right away was the Vlada primer because
it was just a little bit too dark for me
but everything else has been looking so
beautiful and it looks so nice on the
skin okay I'm gonna go and do my brows
on the camera I don't have any new brow
products see specifically and I'll be
back okay you guys so now we're gonna
move on to eyes my brows are done my
eyes are primed and I'm looking
sickening I'm gonna be taking the new
Marc Jacobs iconic multi finished eye
palette in the shade fanta scene I love
that you're clever America so this bad
boy of course comes in at the
limited-edition white and rose gold
packaging so this bad boy has seven
colors in it we have three shimmers and
formats which I think that'll be perfect
for an eye look to make that gold is we
need to me this copper color is really
grabbing my attention I think these are
really really good on the go palette
like if you're into like mobs and like
gold shades you're gonna I think really
really like this one and Marc Jacobs
shadows are known to be stunning and
beautiful anywhere do like a peachy gold
and I I feel like I've done this so much
recently but it's hard to avoid it
because I actually think I look so
pretty in a peachy golden eye copper eye
nude lip honey copper eye nude lip a lot
of people look like make fun before it
like the fact that you do copper I knew
that but I honestly think that it's such
a pretty complimentary look and bitch I
built my career on a copper I knew live
like it's actually so pretty our tickets
Beauty shadows are really really nice
like they just blend effortlessly they
have some kick up of course but like you
can only notice it on this because it's
white I like about this plastic
packaging though is I feel like it
actually like you can clean off the dirt
or any like excess powder real easily
I like this color scheme a lot and it's
super pretty come on pink eye and the
best way possible of course oh this is
romantic bitch I'm gonna fall in love
tonight okay now we're gonna go on with
this like deeper chocolatey shade really
just lightly or if you start light and
then we build put it right in that
socket I feel like I need to be romanced
you know it's been a minute I've been
romanced dude I haven't how are you guys
in the love department why don't you
guys let me know let's have this
conversation in the comments bar below

all the hot gossip you just think of me
as your cool mom for me personally I'm
not dating anyone right now

Department not well but I guess secondly
it's not that it's not well just that
I'm not like really like a focus on it I
did it again recently like we were
talking for a bit and and I'm just like
not being exactly like what I wanted it
to be and I was so
bummed cuz he was so cute distance is a
killer y'all anyway yeah so for me I'm
not really dating anyone right now and
I'm not even getting either I didn't

cuz this is too nice bitch this is Tunis
oh this is everything copper I and you
guys know i'ma doing new live you
already know like I'm a little hyper
today I apologize for my manic behavior
I'm just gonna do what I did on the top
on the bottom lashes no crowd a bit okay
guys I'm gonna go ahead and finish the
other eye off of camera I put some
lashes and mascara on because I actually
don't have anything new for that look at
that so fresh that the glue ain't even
dry yet I don't want to do a wing today
I wasn't in the mood oh you fix my
ladies there we go
how's my lash already lifting bitch I
have even started yet looking I'm so
excited because I'm doing a little bit
of a I want to call it a giveaway but
it's not technically a giveaway
basically I want to do one my followers
make it for prom hmm we chose shy did
you live in Southern California how are
you put it on Instagram like I literally
just put on right now so I'm like so
hype on it cuz I'm so stoked to be able
to do just to get back in a way you know
if you're in high school and you wanted
to put a prom you don't have a date or
anything not only am I gonna glam you I
can be your prom date if you would like
that I mean it just kind of depends if
you want that or not if you don't all
good you there's no pressure
and me being your prom date but it would
be kind of cool we would both go glam of
course that would cover the cost of
everything so it would be just a really
really fun experience we can just go to
prom together and just shake the whole
school damn it would shake the
school down problems like an intense
time and I always want everyone to be
able to at least experience prom people
feel like you know lonely sometimes they
don't have dates and things like that so
it kind of sucks I thought it would be
kind of fun to be able to kind of get
back to when you guys if you guys are
going to prominence in the California we
could do our own little thing you know
and make you look sickening and not only
that we could go to prom together and
literally make everyone scream I'm also
bring this to school lets me go cuz I'm
older but I'm also gay and it's not a
creepy thing in vehicle way to get back
to you guys you know but I'm gonna go

it's such a pretty product a little bit
of body glitter real quickly see you at
all no that's fine Samson actually
didn't really love the body love it
personally I think it just felt like a
little bit too greasy and sticky on the
skin because I want people wearing a
Coachella and I tried it as well and I
was like it's just like not my thing

I personally think that the little this
guy is a lot more fun and more cute and
