today's video is going to be a review
video I'm actually really really excited
to be doing this because I haven't
actually filmed a one I've not done the
video in a while it's actually been like
two weeks since I filmed the video oh my
god my teeth really different if you
guys watched my last video and you watch
this video this is the first video I'm
filming with my new veneers on my teeth
but I tell you guys is going to be
testing out overhyped makeup I've seen a
bunch of makeup on Instagram on YouTube
just different types of brands and
products that have been hyped so
intensely that I'm like okay are these
actually worth the hype like are these
overhyped
for a reason like are they fucking bum
and amazing and like actually worth the
hype or are they kind of shitty and not
really work and not worth the hype at
all so I thought I would do a whole
entire video dedicated to testing out
overhyped makeup in the beauty industry
because there's tons
I got like for example I got the unicorn
tears liquid latex I have the Forrest's
Ollie
jelly beam highlighter iconic London
highlighter drops without huda beauty
foundation all these products have been
so hyped all over Twitter all over
Facebook so that sometimes video is
going to be you guys as always if you
guys do not like this video if you guys
do not like me please don't fucking
watch it you know the drill with that
but if you guys do like this video
please subscribe to my channel if you're
not already and if you're new what's up
a man MUA and welcome to my channel
thank you for being here I really really
really appreciate it but yeah guys let's
all get started on today's video we're
gonna go in guys first product we're
gonna go in with the foundation we're
gonna be using the faux filter huda
beauty foundation
I bought this guy at Sephora today
actually cuz I really wanted to try it
out as the first impressions this high
coverage cream foundation effortless
application camouflages in perfections
so let's go and see I grabbed the shade
cashew it's like a lighter golden
undertone shade I wasn't like the
biggest hand of the shade arrangement
because I was like swatch it on the back
of my hand I think the back of my arm
like right here and I wasn't like seeing
a good variety of shades to me my
opinion and like the shades very much
and it wasn't that wasn't a good variety
cuz there was a lot of shades I was
undertones of the shades I just like
weren't vibing with me personally like I
just undertone wasn't that great so I'm
like yeah whatever so this guy retails
for $40 and it has about 3 and 3/4 so
star full coverage it says skin type 4
combination or normal dry oily for all
skin types has a satin matte radiant and
natural finish that's right I'm just
going to
I'm gonna go in I grabbed the shade of
course like I said earlier cashew 140g
sorry randoms I know it comes with a
pump I like that kind of fade into the
bottle I like that this is a plastic
component for 40 bucks the components
pretty cheap actually let's see how the
foundation inside the back so that's
honestly what really matters it's not
really the packaging that matters it's
the foundation look how light this is I
don't even know if it's gonna match me
holy shit and usually like you guys know
I'm actually like really pale but like
that pale bitch this is what I'm saying
like cashew is like one shade 140 it
might be too late they come on okay
we're playing with the Real Techniques
Beauty Blender sponge I mean it matches
my neck whatever fuck it I can't believe
I'm actually this light like isn't that
so sad look I'm actually this pale not
that it's like bad to be pale there's so
many fucking beautiful people that are
pale it's just me a personal thing for
me like I like to be a little bit more
can you know
okay the fragrance of this holy shit
whew that is strong is a strong scent
guys Wow it's just perfumed it's not
like an actual like specific scent it's
just like perfumed smell okay I think
this is the actually even too light for
me and I am a light bitch I'm a light
bitch man and I think this is actually
too light will bronze up what bronze up
okay this is fucking white is my shirt
not as pale like that is a fucking ghost
you know what other than the shade let's
not talk about the shade let's go ahead
and talk about the finish and the
product and how it feels on the skin yes
I did pry my skin with my normal priming
routine like the benefit Porefessional
and the Smashbox primer water okay
definitely you have to really get into
the pores because it will stay on top of
the pores make sure you're really
blending in on the sides the lighting
might be a little bit too much but I
don't you guys can see there's little
dots all over my pores right here like
it's not going into the pores it's
actually sitting on top of it only on
the nose which is kind of odd other than
the fact I think I got the wrong shade I
do think that the coverage is really
pretty I think the finish is actually
really pretty it's not a matte finish
it's more of a satin finish the coverage
is a nice of medium to full it's
buildable
I can tell already it did go on very
very nice I will say that I went on very
very very nice like obviously I'm kind
of living other than the fact is the
pores on the side that's a weird fuck so
far I like this one oh boy it looks
really pretty on the skin I really do I
get that's the shitty part is that I
actually liked it and I dawn my shade
let me go ahead and
finish up some more of the routine and
we'll go on to the next product
I'll so just turn my brightness down a
little bit hopefully you guys can see a
little bit more clear on the skin I feel
like it was a little bit too bright
those are the skin right now honestly
guys this the foundation looks so
fucking pretty like I'm really happy
with how the foundation is looking I
think it's so so beautiful and now I
need to go back to supporting it my
fucking right shade like this is too
light like I just don't like how it
looks I know a lot of guys would be like
mani romantic you great I don't like a
looks so I'm a darker one now I'm gonna
go ahead and go in with the highlighters
that have been like so hyped like crazy
one the farce oli jelly bean this is the
first jelly highlighter ever and the
shade glazed like literally if you open
it like this shit is literally yeah
it reminds me of flubber this retails
for $40 so let's see if it's worth the
hype man cuz that shit is high I'm also
gonna be using another product I wanted
to use in today's work the hype video
these are the Sailor Moon brushes say
the moon guys hold a special place in my
heart it's actually like what I've
revolved my entire brand and entity off
of is Sailor Moon like the moon I was
inspired so much by her cartoon in the
past so when they came out with like
brushes let's see the moon did it it was
like a random brand that did this I was
so disappointed when I got them in the
mail because it is so poorly made I just
wanted to talk about it in that YouTube
video I don't even see but like
literally this thing is like unhinged I
don't know what's keeping us honest
literally if this is like a little like
just one random press here can hear that
jiggling yeah it's not good at all I
don't know I just wanted to try to test
it out and apply the jelly beam with it
on the right side of my face I'm sure
like it was still applying makeup but
it's just like these are bad like I
really like if you wanted to have them
as a collector's item cuz they're cute
and honestly they really are they're the
cutest brushes I've ever seen but for
practicality and usage they don't work
so let's go ahead and play holy shit
jelly bean is not playing around why is
that literally so stunned
wait now we're gonna blend it in we
can't play with our finger you guys this
is so beautiful you need a very tiny
amount like this is like already too
much you need like that's such a tiny
amount of this bitch I am gooped I am
GAD and I am shook how pretty and
actually blends out what the finger
remind you letting out into the powdered
skin which has already have been
powdered really really nicely like it
doesn't look so harsh and intense like
it's like a hard line between the
highlight and the blush it's B
to fall keep applying it and it builds
beautifully it doesn't build like super
heavy looking you guys jelly beam I love
you well I like about this one too a lot
is that you can blend it out where it
doesn't look too intense but you can
like keep it not as blended and it looks
fucking blinding like bitch this brush
sucks jelly beam is a
win-win-win-win-win I love that so then
I also wanted to try it on this side I
want to try the iconic London drops
these are also all over Instagram dude
these are literally everywhere this is
the iconic London illuminator these have
13.5 milliliters and these are $43 holy
fuck that's expensive we're gonna do the
same thing we're actually into on the
finger this time I'm gonna play it with
the finger oh my guy's randomly shade
this is in the shade original sweet Dee
sweet Dee a don't know the shade I will
put it down below but take the middle
shade oh my god this is so pretty this
one is less intense iconic London drops
is a little bit less in like when you
apply it it's intense right but when you
blend it out one it blends out so
effortlessly you don't see that like it
blends out beautifully like it really
really does feels very nice
not as blinding as the jellybean one for
me like noticing it like on my skin it
doesn't look as blending but it is
beautiful nonetheless there's nothing
harsh about it it just looks beautifully
blended out I feel like it makes my skin
look a little bit wet like I don't know
if like the color actually matches me
that well you can see some of
highlighter right there but honestly
this is another win like this is a win
for me Oh jelly bean I like jelly be
more though I would go with jelly beam I
just like this one a little bit more
excited dries down like into almost a
powder finish does that make sense it's
not like a powder powder but it dries
down where it's not doesn't feel like a
jelly on your skin like it's really
really nice forty bucks though that's a
lot of coin but I would personally buy
it myself because I really like it
that's a win that's over eye product
that's worth the hype so far the only
thing that's like not worth the hype
right now are the Sailor Moon brushes
okay she needs it fucking made look how
bad they are why are these made so
poorly like I literally don't understand
okay guys so I think I just have one a
product left and we are done with this
video
this overhype video so we have a Sailor
Moon brushes honestly I would use more
of them I really would like I would love
to but
I promise you when I say they're not
well made like the only one that is even
like decent is this one cuz it's a brow
spoolie it's a possibly like how hard
can it possibly be this is gonna easily
just pop like you don't okay you don't
understand so someone just decided that
one drop of hot glue would be enough for
this it wasn't you stupid bitch those
look she feels like not too bad and
reapply somehow they don't come to me
it's a little bit of Uranus by me and
jeffree star cosmetics just a little
that's a fan brush it's a fucking fan
brush like it's not I don't think
they're too hard to fuck up you know I
mean it's not a good fan brush it's not
a high quality final brush by any means
but the fan brush like it will work like
I found brush will so that I guess was a
go so you guys as a whole the Sailor
Moon brushes as a whole or a flop do not
buy them I think they're terrible and I
so sad saying that because I'm such a
huge fan of Sailor Moon everything else
so far the foundation the two
highlighters have been great so now
let's go and dry on the lip product that
I grabbed that I really wanted to try
out and see if this worked hi this is
the Too Faced unicorn tears melted latex
lipstick so this is like super hyped up
it looks like this it's actually
beautiful like this is a beautiful
component I think it looks stunning
so the liquid latex are like a liquefied
liquid lipsticks that do not dry down
matte so these are more of a high shine
lipstick this is it looks like a blue a
blue purple let's go and see holy shit
holy shit okay guys so I'm applying
right now formula itself is a little
sticky like it's definitely something
you can feel this is not one of those
lightweight formula it's like I came as
I'm talking like it sticks my lip stick
together the shine is sickening like it
looks fucking cool
definitely it makes my teeth look a
little yellow though which is kind of
annoying classic got purple undertone
with that white reflect so it's gonna
make your teeth look a little bit yellow
white and purple already make your teeth
look pretty bad so then combine like
this I'm not like a great fan and I have
fucking veneers on the top and they
don't look very good if you guys like
high shine liquid lipsticks that are
really intense on the mouth that look
crazy great I think you'll love this so
this guy retails for 21 dollars and has
three and a half stars on Sephora's
website honestly I'm just not a fan of a
color and the formula is a little bit
too sticky as well like this for me is
not a go like I would never wear this
again like honestly unless it was like
for Halloween or an event like that's
like for something like this that's like
more of a holographic
purple lip unless it's for something
like that like this is not being worn
and good if you are a huge fan of
holographic liquid lipsticks then I
think you'd fucking love it thank you
and live and gag and breathe and die for
it I'm just personally not that's a
no-go don't really like it and I think
that 21 bucks is a little bit expensive
for this for what the what I got you
know and that's it you guys that's it
for the entire video of these products
that are in the beauty industry that are
very very very overhyped to see if they
are actually worth the price or not I do
think three of them here are worth the
hype we have the huda beauty foundation
I think it looks beautiful on the skin
really I do I can't wait to like try it
out more and actually go get my right
shade and then of course I really really
really really like the two highlighters
as well they're beautiful the things
that work flat for me are the Sailor
Moon brushes and the liquid latex
unicorn tears I just don't like the
color I think it's too sticky and that's
it for me so that's kind of like not my
cup of tea okay guys that's it for
today's video I hope you guys enjoyed
watching it of course I leave everything
I talked about in today's video linked
it down below if you guys are interested
in checking them out wherever I find it
I will leave them linked down below yeah
and I'm gonna go film another video and
be protecting a little bitch today I
love you guys so much and I'll catch you
guys in my next video bye guys
I love you black I love you I love you
you know I even love you not love
because that is too strong but la hey
guys it's only get in start
Ziya you fucking jingles man not the
cake and bake I'm gonna go ahead and so
for app no shut the fuck up bitch I'm
scared it's like a little ocean blinding
ass bitch right now like it makes me
truly upset that someone could do this
to say their fucking move just sarena
move to something off
I get one more come on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
