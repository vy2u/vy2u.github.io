in today's video is going to be a fun
testing products video you guys know I
live live and breathe and die for these
kind of testing products videos I've
just gotten into them recently within
the past couple months and they're so
fun to try especially cuz I can do a
couple of them in one day and I can get
so much done it just it's great the
whole thing about it is great and I
absolutely love it so today's video is
going to be testing paper makeup I
literally have a plethora of paper
makeup that I bought I've seen this
floating around on Twitter and I was
people like testing out paper makeup and
putting it on their faces and seeing
like literally foundation like that was
in paper bronzer that was in paper blush
and highlighter in paper form and you
put it on and you apply it and I was
just like like that sounds really really
cool to me you know I just wanna test
out paper makeup for myself I want to
see if it's bomb does it work does it
not work and I just kind of wanted to
see what it was these are all from my
Couture my Couture as always if you guys
all like this view if you guys do not
like me please don't fucking watch it
you know that you're with that but if
you guys do like this video please
subscribe to my channel if you're not
already and if you knew what's up and
man um you and welcome to my channel
thank you so much for being here I
really really appreciate it yeah it's
going to get into testing of paper
makeup okay so let's read about the
product I learn just pulled it up on
liner right now we have different kinds
I got foundation paper bronzer paper
blush paper and highlight paper
foundation paper is $18 highlight paper
is $18 a blush paper is $15 and the
bronzing paper is $18 as well so the
reason I'm actually wearing makeup right
now is I wanted to take out half of my
face apply the paper makeup on the side
with nothing on and I also wanted apply
on the side with a full base on already
because they are promoted and they're
talking about as blotting papers they're
on-the-go blotting papers are not
specifically like a full coverage
foundation on bare skin you know what I
mean but I want to try it out on both
ways they are blotting papers that are
on the go that you apply when you're
like getting oily and it deposits color
as well that's what the site looks like
and that's what the site says to me so
I'm gonna test it today on my face on
half with makeup on and half with my
makeup on so I grabbed a little white
beam that oh why be take
my right side because it's easier to see
what I'm implying it so I'll take off
this side goddamn whoa and there we have
it we have half the beat on well I'm
gonna keep the eye makeup on because I
know that I make it was a knife
honestly it's very pretty so I'm gonna
keep that shit on I mean there's
literally no point taking off my makeup
because there's no eye makeup that's
paper okay you know what we're gonna use
this to prep the skin be fair be fair
and prom your fucking skin do not cheat
Matt be fair in this review isn't this
such a trip like this to me this is a
fucking trip like we literally have
pages of paper foundation that's weird
so this is the nude glow flawless to go
foundation powder paper how to glow to
go step one tear one sheet from the
booklet use one sheet for entire face
step 2 press and sweep sheet all over
face step 3 use sheet to buff and smooth
out powder right thing so let's go ahead
and rip our page first we're gonna play
on the bare skin face nice whoa so my
fingers I press and sweep sheet all over
face and you shoot above him so press
and sweep press ensue
you guys are really trying this work you
guys understand here that's what she
done like that's all I could use for a
sheet it because I have a man faith I'm
not mirror it's writing to the page try
another page dear God dear God no no no
in settling in my bugging pores you can
see like right there where it's at you
can see how it falls into your pores
like a mother fucker okay guys so we're
gonna use it on the other side as well
let's be fair ensues on the other side
as if it's a blotting paper okay
Oh God
can see right there I talk to make my
pores look so fucking gnarly I mean it
looks way better on this side than it
does on this side clearly look at those
pores look at the unevenness this side
is definitely not much better it's still
falling into my pores in this area right
here makes them super super emphasized
and intense so far the foundation powder
is kind of busting for me that's
definitely not a it's not a go it's not
a go let's go and take the bronzing
paper now yeah so we have the bronzer
papers right here okay
so let's use this this is the most cool
toned bronzer I've ever ever seen it
literally is making me look like I have
a hollow cheek rub it and pat rub and
Pat okay but why is it making my cheek
look so cut though not gonna lie it's
cool for contour for bronzer I'll put it
on the bronzer areas okay also I've
noticed at the bronzer this is where I
put the bronzer it almost looks shiny
ah-ah that is shiny and the shadows it
looks cool but as when you hit the light
it's shiny it's like a shiny bronzer
doesn't ring since it's shiny
okay let's see the sign
so the sidewith foundation is definitely
me luckily have a contoured cheek not
gonna lie I'm kind of living for this
contour don't you but it's so fucking
harsh and intense like you can't really
pat it out or else is gonna just deposit
more and more color it just keeps going
higher and higher definitely better on
the side with the foundation and the
side without but still bronzer not ago
okay so let's go ahead and try out B
highlighter now I got a little sample of
so we have the highlighter now we are
using the highlighting paper in the
shade who don't belong in the shade at
Crystal Cove so let's go ahead and apply
some Hank paper where is that read that
oh I feel like I'm doing the fucking
full face using highlighter challenge
all over again
this is so fucked definitely is giving a
highlight though you cannot there's no
denying that's highlighting my face it
just looks so blotchy and you really
cannot work with this whatsoever let's
try it the rest of the highlighting
people on this side with the actual star
T lightly oh wait the highlighter that
worked that fucking worked on the side
with foundation and stuff already on it
whoa whoa whoa go light handed with it
that definitely definitely made it so
much more blinding intense don't put it
don't on you for I don't know I just
tried that but on the highlight spot
that fucking worked oh girl god no no ya
know if that piece the highlighter
huh one side was atrocious and the other
side actually was fucking sick nasty so
that one is a that one's a little
conundrum right there
we have blush paper right here and this
is the last one guys the last paper
thing hmm we're gonna take the shade
Studio City I'm going to rip out a page
of blush I'm going to put it on the
blushy area
hey it's definitely depositing some
color that one is definitely depositing
some color which is cool
there's so much here so much here and
like literally nothing right here where
I actually started to apply it so that's
really weird on the side with the base
it definitely is looking so much better
than the one with out why is it actually
looking really fucking pretty taking off
my makeup that's annoying like I
literally am getting like I'm getting
foundation here that's fucking annoying
as fuck but at least a color that
deposited was actually pretty and it
looks pretty sweet on this side and that
was the blush so we have this side which
is with no foundation on with literally
nothing on just it's just prepped and
yeah that one's rough and then we have
this side which is the side that already
had foundation on had a full face of
makeup on already don't look that bad at
all to me don't look that bad at all to
me okay guys so final verdict on these
products what I think about it I'm gonna
talk about side with no makeup on inside
with makeup on so foundation paper sided
with nothing on it was fucked the
foundation paper did not work at all it
was so so patchy so just gross looking
and the side with makeup already on I
also didn't like it I thought it did not
work very very well the color that was
deposited was falling to the pores
really really badly and I just don't
think it looks good for sulfur
foundation paper that's a Miss for me I
talked about the bronzing paper so we
have the bronzing paper on the side with
no makeup on the bronzing paper is
probably the worst on the side with no
makeup on it is literally shiny I don't
have words I'm out of words to talk
about it just doesn't work the same
things I said about the foundation paper
same thing applies for the bronzer paper
the reason I also don't like it on the
side with the base already on is because
it's such a cool toned color usually
bronzers are supposed to be a little bit
more warm in tone but this is extremely
extremely cool tone and it has that
shiny finish which I don't like I think
if you were in the Sun it would look
really off like shiny from literally
here to here like that just looks really
weird to me that doesn't give you any
kind of depth it doesn't give you any
kind of like illusion to having higher
cheekbones nothing so I think that the
bronzing paper was a complete flaw on
both sides
well let's talk about the highlighting
paper I think the highlighting paper uh
here I don't know what happened to it it
got literally taken off by the blush
there's literally nothing left a little
bit right here Leia bar here and that's
about it so that was a complete flop on
this side it definitely gets a shine
don't get me wrong it gives you a shine
but it's still a flop the side with the
base already on the highly paper totally
worked so on this side it was a complete
miss for me but on the side with that
base already done the highlight paper
was a total success so putting on top of
a highlighter it definitely made it more
intense more blinding more enhanced so I
don't know that one makes you a little
confused that one did work it definitely
got the job done it made it look more
bright and more intense and so last but
not least we have blush the blush on
this side there's blush down there's
definitely Bush on my face I can see
some type of pink color it's so heavy
right here even though I applied more of
it right here I don't understand how
that happened
it just looks a little weird to me in my
opinion no no no but on this side it
totally deposited the color really
nicely and it was blended out really
really well on the side with the base
already on with blush Rt Hon like I was
kind of shocked at how I see that one
blended and it came off as really
pigmented as well I was like whoa so
same thing applies like I said the
highlighter on the side with the face
already done blush and highlight they
worked pretty well foundation and
bronzer paper on both sides to me were
not good at all
and yet guys that's it for the today's
video because I have fun watching I hope
this helped in any way shape or form a
lot of people have been asking me what I
thought about the paper makeup and this
is my final verdict I think that it's a
fun product thing is really fun and kind
of edgy and very very different I just
don't think it's the most practical
product $18 for 50 pieces of paper I
don't know man it just doesn't really
make sense in the wallet sense for
example you can like put a highlighter
in your purse or you can put a blush in
your purse and it's gonna be more
practical because you can actually get
more uses you get a lot more out of it
bang for your buck but if you're so on
the go where you can't fit those kind of
things in there you need to just toss in
a paper the blush and the highlight I
totally would like I think it would
actually be pretty practical if you guys
are so on-the-go have no space in your
bags for anything toss in a piece of
paper and put some blush on later on on
top of set foundation please God because
this is not this is not happening
besides not it's not that it's not the
business so I don't know you guys this
is one of those products you have to use
at your own discretion whether you guys
want to spend the money or not I just
wanted to talk about it I put it on my
face I gave you guys the demo this is
something that you guys definitely try
out for yourselves I don't know man I
don't know this is one of the things
words like I personally will not buy
this again I personally will literally
probably never use this again but if you
guys are someone that's on-the-go that
needs just blotting papers in the purse
just a quick little touch-up just like
kind of blot then I think it could be
more practical for you guys but other
than that I don't see it really working
out in any way shape or form
yeah I got some because I found out
watching this video I'll leave where you
can buy these bad boys down below if you
guys are interested in checking them out
but as always have a great so the night
or day where you guys are and I will
