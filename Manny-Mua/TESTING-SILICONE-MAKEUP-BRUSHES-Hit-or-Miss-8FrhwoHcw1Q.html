so today's video is going to be a fun
review of a this weird-ass product at
least couple products I wanted to try
how I have been getting tagged to do a
video on this on these actually the
silicone brushes is what they look like
before literally like months I've been
getting tagged and has to do this and I
finally bought them on Amazon I've just
been putting it off I have no idea why
and I finally bought them and I'm Leo
gives me fucking review these they look
very I'm very intrigued by them they are
silicone brushes I don't know it like
the whole thing just seems very weird
very gimmicky and I'm kind of like I
don't think I'm gonna like it but I
don't want to speculate I don't want to
think that I like it I'm gonna go in
open-minded yeah that's a zero is going
to be I'm going to be reviewing at least
silicone brushes today which is so
awkward there's one just drop it right
into it I'm gonna film a couple videos
today and decider as always if you guys
do not like this video if you guys do
not like me please don't fucking watch
it you know the joy back but if you guys
do like this video please go ahead and
subscribe to my channel if you're not
already and if you're new what's up a
man um you a and welcome to my channel I
really appreciate you being here anyway
yeah let's go ahead and get into this
review on these silicone brushes I'm so
excited it's like there's six of them
okay cool
all righty then let's go ahead and
fucking go right in with these silicone
rings I'm gonna be going in with the
natural radiant long wear foundation
from NARS I've been really really really
liking this foundation nah we're just
talking about these really quick fees
the little package came with six of them
and they retailed for I think it was
like 15 to 20 bucks on Amazon not
including shipping or tax so technically
like altogether it wasn't too expensive
it really I mean like that's not too too
pricey three four six brushes you know I
mean these probably know what the thing
I really don't so I'm gonna go in right
away to pubs on the little paddle or
Guarini
it feels like hard like when you're
applying it it feels like mean something
plastic like this it feels hella weird
okay and it feels kind of Tuggy but when
you go like this like when you spank it
in there's no Street but when you're
like moving it like a normal brush you
would there's hella streaks usually when
I'm applying it with a brush or with a
Beauty Blender the facial hair doesn't
like matter like it doesn't like fuck
with my facial hair at all but going in
with this where it doesn't like finesse
the product into my skin my facial hair
definitely looks cakey and gross and it
never looks like that
so in this area right here it's
beautiful it's fucking beautiful
and I didn't even like I literally use
like one two pumps let's see we can do
so I don't know if it's the foundation
that's looking beautiful or it's the
application I already know the
foundations stunning what I will say
about this that a little bit goes a very
long way like this bitch carries I did
one pump the whole forehead was caught
her honey and for me that's like a big
deal because I have a big ass fucking
man thing is like a big fucking man
gotta eat that so it makes a difference
okay looking close up at my skin the
problem is that it's not like blending
into anything okay on the nose I can't
do it okay pat pat pat spanking like you
would an ass you know like a good ass
just like so on the areas that are flat
I like have no texture no hair no
nothing if you're patting it in like
this it looks pretty nice actually like
I feel like the coverage was really nice
like the finish is really nice ball
around the nose you see or on that
fucking nose a lot of character and so
when you try to put it in there it makes
the streaks on the side over here and
it's like go back see this let's read it
let's give it a rating on a scale of one
to ten ten being on my thigh and one
being not am i selling I would say this
is a whopping three it is okay now let's
go ahead and go with some concealer
because it's a little product was a long
way I'm taking a little bit of the Tarte
shape tape like a little and we're gonna
go ahead and use this brush which is
like a weirdly hoot it's a weird I'm
saying well it looks like it's like goes
like that it has it go weird for
Oh like pokes me it's hard I mean the
coverage is there because this doesn't
take away any coverage it like keeps
everything in place but literally it's
so hard he honestly that another thing
till I noticed even when I'm patting it
drags my skin so intensely like what is
a premature wrinkles you know what I
mean like hardcore like it's so draggy
on the look at that and that's just me
like softly like doing this it's like
almost sticky I mean the under eye looks
nice I'm not gonna lie down really needs
to be really real the look like
underneath the eye is there like it
looks fucking kunti what are gonna make
this hold on I would say a three again
another three that's the whole wha none
of these things I would apply with
powder to be really real we're gonna set
my under eye really quickly okay you
have all these other types of brushes I
kind of wanted to use two let's use this
one this looks like it would be a light
contour it's shaped like a blush contour
brush would so like a little contour a
platoon let me get a cream contour
product Oh how's like fucking got guy
let's see
I mean it cuts it
it sure does it's actually not as bad as
I thought it was gonna be to be really
real like I thought I was gonna be so
much worse that's going this so she goes
didn't see little bit more clear like we
really like this shit cuts take some
mini like this definitely takes much
much much longer than using a beauty
blender or brush like way too long
oh you blend it on the other side just
fine and you want to be a bitch on this
side okay it's fine no it's cool okay
this brush I would give it a 4 a little
bit better than other ones but still
floppy my face so he grabs - I see
dipbrow already going with the silicon
this brush which looks like a little
angled brush I'm gonna use just right
brow cuz I feel like it's thick as fuck
I'm not gonna use it as an eyeliner and
it came with an eyeliner brush came with
this guy so I feel like that would be
for eyeliner specifically you know go in
people why I'm I'm not hitting it for
the brow oh hold on the bottom part of
the brow it's a little more rough not
calling because we have a brow on this
is using in the dark brunette dip brow -
Nasia because of the fact that this does
not absorb any product you pick up so
much product like I know for a fact like
you don't understand how much dip brow
is in my brow right now like it is
flooded with dip brow it's ridiculous
like this is the most intense eyebrow
I've had enough fucking minute also you
can't really finesse it into the hair
this is like bitches going down and
that's what it is it's not like gonna be
blended into anything well at the end of
its like the look is there and it puts
down product really nicely so I would
say this one out of 10 I'll give it a 5
it's better than the 3 and the 4 let's
go in with Vance wine so I'm gonna take
my Paint Pot from Mac and ply it on my
eyeball my linh played pretty good
little streaky shit is so hard to pick
up any product on like it's so hard so
applying an eyeshadow base with this no
no no I want to use this again I'm gonna
flip it over and I'm gonna use a glitter
eyeshadow and see how the glitter
eyeshadow
reiax don't take the Stila glimmer and
glow shadow and see how he applies a
liquid or cream shadow I'm just very
curious because I mean like this is what
it would be used for his applying creams
but I didn't like the way applied my
primer so I'm like okay let's know what
applies this okay yeah see this is like
so much nicer for a cream shadow
okay so does it apply it nicely it does
and it leaves like no streaks and it
does go on nice but the problem still is
the tugging and there's so much tugging
going on with this silicone brush that
it literally drives me fucking crazy
like it tugs my entire I ain't but it
looks beautiful I'm not gonna light
looks like in the sickening and it did
apply on the lid very nicely so maybe
like this one would work really good for
like a spotlight like a little like DVD
or like if you want it instead of
wanting to use your finger it might work
well for that but it's so Tuggy it makes
me want to scream looks good
okay guys rating I will have to say
though it applied that shadow
beautifully it looks so good no streaks
went on full coverage I brought how to
use any product looks really nice I want
to give this one a 6 hour most highest
rated brush good job 6 in a world of
success beer 10 so now I'm ready I'm
gonna take the dipbrow and I'm gonna use
it as my eyeliner because the dark brown
so I'm gonna take my little silicone
eyeliner brush I'm gonna do eyeliner
over oh this is so win let's see let's
see
okay I get it tugs but it's fine
honestly it's going on pretty good what
the issue is here with this one is
because it doesn't have a brush or just
have a bristle to make the top line you
see the line right here usually like
people like to have that like be very
very crisp and sharp and clean with this
is actually very hard to get that to be
crisp and clean because you basically
mean like the tip of the brush to do
that not the side of it so you have to
like really make sure you finesse that
doesn't look bad at all I'm actually
kind of shook because that does not look
bad at all I think looks actually pretty
nice I'm not going to I do a wing with
it this is what we're getting floppy
this is what we're getting
okay eyeliner is on I cannot do a fine
point with this due to the fact that it
is a silicon tip it does not go into a
fine little tiny line so I have to keep
it like this but it totally worked
it did it's kind of it was kind of
floppy in the beginning it's not like my
favorite or anything that I probably
want to either forever use it again
that's that's the team would we rate
this I'll write this guy a seven
actually this is probably my highest
rated one because it totally worked and
like made my line smooth you had to
really finesse it in but you can do it
you can make this work okay okay you
know and no I can give it to seven I'm
gonna give it a six I'm gonna give her a
six because I'm trying to rego over it
and it's like tugging too much and it's
picking up the product underneath it's
not the business it's not we're gonna
have to go with the six I'm sorry had to
demote you baby you got to go from a C
to Adi you're officially failing my
class sorry guys I think I my verdict I
didn't want to do a full face using this
because I mean technically already did I
just wanted to use these brushes to put
in the spots like I would think that you
would use it for okay guys so what do we
think of these brushes collectively what
do we think as a total I think they were
a yeah they were a total fail for me
like they did not work very well I think
that my turn out like okay the brow is
honestly I didn't live and I really
wanted to live but I didn't live a
thousand lines no collectively I would
say save your money do not buy silicone
brushes I don't think that they worked
very very well the one that will say
that like I feel is the most practical
are these two right here but I know I'm
not gonna ever use them I might use this
one actually this one I might use to
apply like glitter or something like
that cuz it's a good packing situation
but if you see like the face ones don't
buy any of the face ones if you want to
buy it I want just to try it out as I
can pack
go right ahead that won't I wouldn't say
he's like terrible or anything he died
so give it a 6 out of 10
the face is just so bad like Wow
so yeah you guys I'm kind of shook about
this I will leave these link down below
if you guys are interested in checking
them out I would say for me they are a
flop I would say not to buy them they
are pretty look at I like the other teal
like they're adorable but they just
didn't work anyway you guys that is it
for today's video I love you guys so
much okay so the night or day wherever
you guys are and I will catch you guys
in my next video
hey guys are we recording can you hear
me can you hear me hey guys
I would a oh I'm sorry but geez I need a
haircut
fuck I do okay oh my gosh okay so with
this okay next brush will be with next
five right here she gets the fucking
fine she gets the fucking fuck it's so
Tuggy it makes me want to scream like
actually you like fucking George in the
jungle fucking hmm scream my life that
you can clean these off so easily
but I'm not gonna use we can't stop like
my mind's rationalizing for me you like
for these so the King bad oh I'm an
