today 0 is going to be another review
video I am currently pre filming right
now because I'm going to be going out of
town for a while like 2
weeks basically so I'm presuming doing a
lot of random ass things so today as you
can see from the title I'm going to be
reviewing these little mermaid tail
brushes these are going viral online a
lot of you guys have been asking me to
review them I'm assuming these are like
more like for contouring brushes cuz
they're so thin and tiny and they're
literally shaped like a little fishtail
or a mermaid tail whatever you want to
say so I just thought I would try them
out for you guys you guys my notice to
have a little a little tan going on
right now because I just did a photo
shoot recently would benefit and I was
really really really really really
bronzy actually I'll be matching my face
to my neck for reals today oh she's
exciting like really intense and sharp
and we'll see if they actually work or
not or is it just a gimmick who knows
well find out but yeah guys as always if
you guys don't like this video if you
guys don't like me please don't
watch it you know the drill with that I
say it everything the video if you guys
don't like me please don't watch this
video
but if you like this video please go
ahead and subscribe to my channel if you
aren't already and if you're new what's
up my name you a and welcome to my
channel thank you so much for being here
I really appreciate it yeah let's go
ahead and get into this review on these
mermaid tail brushes and whether or not
they were okay so I went ahead I did my
base off of camera just the foundation
and concealer part and I set underneath
my eyes I want to use this with some
cream contouring or basically liquid
contouring basically anything to do with
contouring that's what I kind of figured
in my mind what this brush would be used
for is contouring because it gives you
that like the intense sleekness let me
tell you exactly where I got this up
though let's just really quickly I got
this from flawless lighting calm and
this is the mermaid foundation brush oh
it's a foundation brush I had no idea
this was a foundation brush and this is
$14 that is what the price of these
these I would never use this kind of
brush as foundation though which is kind
of funny I don't know what hey this
isn't sat on my for idea so I'm making
use a little bit let's just try it let's
just try it
this isn't set on my forehead yet oh
yeah I mean it's definitely adding some
coverage that means because the bristles
are actually pretty calm
and dense and it's allowing me to really
set everything in place that totally
worked
holy I'm okay so now many
is it for the contour which is what I
was really a planning on using it for
anyway I'm he's the same exact little
brush on the point to end I'm gonna take
this ultra HD concealer from makeup
forever this is the y49 shade I don't
know if his all this is look so dark I'm
take a little might take a little hair
I'll take a little hair except about an
event later on today and I really can't
 up although this is so dark I
really should not risk the hats I really
sit and do this my hula stick is
broken
okay guys okay so I found something that
can definitely definitely use this is
the Tarte TARDIS pro glow and they have
a cream contour in this so I'm totally
gonna use it with that I'm gonna taking
a little bit the shade shade clever I'm
just gonna literally just press it in so
let's try this little mermaid mother
freaking Hecker some parents gonna blend
upwards
hmm
hey this is not blending for him
take this brush I'm gonna take the
morphe y6 and just press that over the
actual contour and blend that out for
real okay so we have some color down I
was a little that was a little rough
okay that's right on this side not
dipping back in we're just go straight
into the okay that should don't
blend for nothing actually don't
blend for nothing
oh that will not blend with that brush
by itself no we're gonna do a
smidgen down the nose and do I think
this is a good idea no I don't because
honestly I shouldn't actually and I
really shouldn't be doing this I don't
know what the I'm thinking I'm
gonna take a little bit down the center
of the nose to contour my nose and they
don't have a final product after that
okay so actually I mean it puts down the
product it does but it also just like
swipes it away I know this my
nose is so okay guys so I think
I'm actually done uh I think I have my
verdict on the brushes and whether or
not I think they are worth the money
whether I would think they're worth
fifteen bucks or not I personally think
that this product is much more of a
gimmicky product a little area of
foundation that you get for it it just
it's just not enough you know what I
mean like you're gonna be hitting your
head on the actual metal part like it's
just funky like it's just weird
I don't know I guess just to me it just
feels really uncomfortable I might not
even hold this thing like do I do it
like this like a flipper
when applying the foundation did it work
yes it did it did apply the coverage yes
it did do I think it's worth the 14 or
15 bucks that it's priced at no I don't
I think it's fun I don't think it's a
cool little collector's item for sure
and if you want to get it for that
reason
 yeah but you guys want to get it to
actually like really like use it for
your foundation and be like sick nasty
and looking sick and beat to the ground
I just don't think it's that practical
I'm much much much rather use like this
brush this flat top kabuki brush to
blend out my foundation or do something
with that over this technically I just
think it's much more of a gimmicky
product and I don't really think that's
worth the money but it's fun it's
definitely a fun little collector's item
to have it's your your money you spend
it the way you want to I'm just kind of
giving my two cents in my review on what
I think of it personally and my personal
dots I'm just not the biggest biggest
fan I was a little confused using it and
I feel like my face looks a little
 and actually have to go in an
event after this so I really need to
actually get my together because I
need to go but yeah guys thank you guys
so much for watching hope you guys
enjoyed this video I'll leave where I
got this down below of course if you
guys are interested in it I thought it's
a really fun idea and the concept is
really fun as well so thank you to
everyone that sent me this product to
try out
I personally not a fan but who gives a
 I just want an opinion out of mini
okay so if you want to get it do your
thing and get it if not I'll get two bad
guys I love you guys so much who gave
you the night or day where you guys are
and I'll catch you guys in my next video
bye you guys
okay you guys I went ahead and I did my
bum bum Duty bum tip
