gonna be a first time for everything
okay so light dude no actually it looks
pretty okay yeah a little bit pink on
you probably it's in the shade I would
pick out the group but it's doable for
sure the brush I like a lot more why is
this look pretty on me
no it looks really actually looks really
pretty on you yeah I'm actually as I'm
putting on with the brush I'm liking a
lot more yeah it's really pretty
actually this definitely is like I would
say like a soft everyday moment for
people not so much like a clubbing go
out okay this is about my fourth pump
but actually really think the finish is
really nice
okay guys so now I don't really have a
new concealable denars NYX and shade
stage so bye guys
honesty times right now in the beauty
community a rough a little rough I'm
really tired of seeing other people's
fathers bash each other and like I'm
just started at the hate man not even
for me I'm just
seen in general like so so much
aggression and the beauty community
supposed to be like a happy place where
we talk about really ugly but luckily
there is of course of so much of love
and positive area but there's no denying
that there's been so much more hate you
recently yeah I don't know what it is
what do you what what change I'm even
getting each of a lot longer than I oh
yes and it definitely wasn't also
YouTube's just changed so much it used
to be like even the videos like the
content used to be only tutorials but I
get it like even myself I got gonna burn
out on doing makeup tutorials every day
only men is this thing right can we move
on you know yeah I got tired with it too
that's why don't do it like now I'm like
I never like even do tutorials I just do
like more like it raises me and I like
show you know how I do a makeup I'm not
ever relieved and I like to put a spin
on it too late a full face of this and
so just like a plain ol makeup squirrel
again and again and again Oh peach
perfect powder I know I know okay let's
try it okay yeah
peach powder
okay not for me
taste it taste it just let me do a
little it's just like yes it tastes so
good with the candy yeah we're fun dip
yeah oh here we go I think you're being
like fucking ratty and I mean disgusting
fucking here we go
you have to go there here we have you
here again laurleen it's not getting a
different color cuz I'm very yellow
undertone more so and this is more pinky
but yeah it doesn't really give me color
same so what do you think I like it
continue I like it mm-hmm it's a little
like drawing looking on you yeah yeah
okay so we're basically done on the base
portion now we're gonna do some bronzer
and it's not have any bronzer but I'm
excited to talk about this drones or
this is the limited edition hoola
bronzer
it's so cute we both partnered with
benefit and we did this really cool
Desert Island campaign and it was such a
fun experience I will have shared
together like a mouth uh-huh and blow
with my first bronzer I ever owned so
it's like a really warrior so organized
yeah like 360 for me it just like nuts
like when I was working in Sephora this
is the first bronzer I ever got as a
gratis yeah and so being I'm like the
face of it for in Sephora it's like
really nice and everything blows my
fucking mind look pre-snap talking life
so cute
I chose a hoola bronzer specifically
because I love the color I think it's
such a beautiful like natural neutral
color sure it's not too orange it's not
too cool it's not too anything it just
gives you a nice bronzy effect this is
what makes it right here head a little
brush so this is actually limited
edition packaging so this is gonna be in
Sephora for the next couple months I
believe yeah it's a with you or is your
precisely brow pencil has her face on it
yep you guys go into Sephora and you see
it just snap a pic and tag as we want to
see have you been in support to see it
yet No
oh my god I'm so fucking we're going
after this so I would say my favorite
way to apply it is with a big fluffy
brush so just getting it all over bronze
and then of course you guys can use its
little brush and if you guys want to
just do a quick little precise
application for example it has like more
of a tapered brush you can do a little
one to give it a quick I know I know
okay guys so we also have the new peach
peach FRA it's as happy fun this is a
new highlighter they came out they came
out with Rogers and blushes that are
cream as well oh I didn't know that
those you have to tell me what looks
like yeah specially in person like the
lights are so soft in here it kind of
gives me something personal in person to
see nothing so I really like the V in
primary and the foundation a lot yeah
but this one I'm not the biggest fan of
unless it's like a real real natural
yeah this is peach broth but you know
what no it's not
yeah yes please look good build it
honestly yeah you don't even see them at
shimmer do can you see it on me and I'm
a lighter complexion so like a little
bit like I see a little bit but it's not
a blush I would do like we're all so I
don't remit many of our deeper skin
tones this one is called peach blur
peach blur translucent smoothing
finishing powder what you're kidding oh
look what I did look what I did
I couched it so you're telling me this
is translucent powder
trés is it smoothing finishing powder
and peat infused with peach and sweet
big cream I would never put this all
over my face is shimmery but it
definitely gives you a soft peach tone I
would definitely not use that Peter I'm
just
so confused by this probably just being
honest same okay I want to use as I late
oh yes
I have not tried this out yet i've
swatched a load on my hand and i wasn't
like not like blown away no do you know
the color pop highlighting kids I
suppose I'll do the darker one okay I'll
do this Goldie what are you thinking um
maybe this way you do that one
let's do this this was really known
looks really nice this isn't it's shiny
as fuck but it's a really powdery oh
it's thick I bet this is why me
okay I'm gonna do the light gold try it
that's pretty that's nice that's more
like it like I like a blinding my light
yeah it's pretty
like that's blinding this gives off such
an intense
that's like golden sheen oh and I chose
yeah that's like a white gold shit oh my
god
so nice on you gold would not look that
good on me like more like you chose okay
that's a hit for me yes I like it
approved okay guys we have the new to
face of peach mist mattifying a setting
spray yes more matte but no spray you
can smell other spray when you smell a
lot of peach a to peachy oh it smells
good it's almost fucking good nothing
lying I'll mix a little bit with a touch
of any because it is more mattifying I
can't like other than the blush yeah
it's pretty nice
oh the highlight too but the rest of the
products I love including the foundation
that was great me too okay guys so next
is brows in yukking he's that one but I
have the new market brow pencil a brand
new shit happens I'm so stoked actually
love love love the component of it nine
seconds really it looks really good I
get the pencil side we need this please
I'm like living doesn't my color let me
see good oh yeah yeah that's better
okay guys we're using ljubka okay so
this color is a little still too light
for me he's pretty much black huh
okay guys so I'm thinking the color just
doesn't really imagine me very much what
do you think about the pencil is not bad
at all
I can't wait to try those like it is
really like crits creamy yeah it's like
small precise it's Miami I wanted like
the NYX micro brow pencil no they're
cheaper they're half the price of the
NYX one Nixon 980 fucking dollars wow
I'm so good I mean I definitely like my
Anastasia brow Wiz over this one okay I
just figure because I just feel like it
applies a little bit better okay but for
five bucks guys no I really don't think
you can be that like it definitely gives
you a nice yeah like brow age for sure
look at that like that's pretty good so
we have the brows on yes actually I'm
really really liking the broad way I
tried it out too on the end of this brow
and it worked out very well
girl that's how we end so what are you

to take V just peachy Matt damn

recent you think they cannot was oh my
geez we're here for it so this is what
Kandi's palette looks like Lance is much

cheesy to put the Sistine Chapel on the
eyes no pretty really nice man
like they're not excessively peppery
uh-huh which is cool wow they're much
more people did on the I ain't then I
thought like I thought there's gonna be
so much lighter you know I mean you do
make a different I go in heavy-handed

way I blend better than you
