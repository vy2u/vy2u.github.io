so today's video is going to be a review
video I love doing random review videos
for you guys you guys always send me
random ass things to try out I get a lot
of tweets from you guys saying to try
random products out and you go to me
little products and links and things
like that and I will totally go out and
buy them at Rhys Matthew guys and I got
so many tweets about this little sponge
and I was like it's a lot of buns like
wheats on this so that was super super
random but I went out and bought it at
Sephora this is the little cake in baked
sponge this is from Vera moan or die by
you from this is yeah so this is from
Baramulla
this is a cake and baked sponge I bought
this on some fours website so I saw this
and I'm like a square beauty but it's
actually really this is like it's like a
really weird shape what shape is this
chapter so laters on the type of shit I
was really bad at geometry so if you
guys know what kind of shape this is let
me know when contour below is it like a
rhombus or trapezoid of some type or a
five
I know sign octagon so I decide I want
to review this much I was hearing so
many different about its and just like
the best Beauty Blender type sponge dupe
so I'm like is this really the world's
best Beauty sponge of all time we will
see we'll check it out right now this is
the size of it when I open it right out
of the box so as always if you guys like
this video if you guys don't like me
please don't fucking watch it you know
that your with that but if you guys do
like this video please subscribe to my
channel if you are not already and if
you knew what's up and many M you ain't
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here
and yeah let's going to get to this
review on this quote-unquote best Beauty
sponge ever we'll see again so first
part we're gonna go ahead and soak this
in water let's see what it says maybe we
only need to how to use wet cake and
bake with water until completely
saturated squeezing out excess liquid
pick up liquid or powdered makeup
products with a top and bottom flat edge
and apply to conceal and or bake okay
we're back so I went and I soaked the
bad bitch up and I squeezed out all the
excess water and this is what it looks
like now it actually really did so much
why is this remind me of a fucking cock
hmm I don't know I clean definitely got
a lot bigger those holy shake ups so
much bigger so what we're gonna do is
we're going to try this bad bitch out
and see if it works like a Beauty
Blender or not or if it's even better
than a Beauty Blender who knows no see
so we're gonna do our normal routine
though guys we are going to do primer
and it's at Porefessional we're going to
do is all the same routine as usual so
I'm going to go in with the wet wild
photos focus Foundation actually bought
a new color because I thought the other
clubs a little bit too dark for me this
is in the shade shell ivory again not
the best color selection it's like the
one that was closest possibly to me so I
don't know if it's gonna work out or not
we'll see I just really like this
foundation I've been wanting to give it
more try so I thought the other ones
just look so much fuch ah oh my god this
is so white oh my god okay mr. cake in
big sponge assessees on the tip Justin
tip pick up the liquid or powder makeup
products with the top or bottom flat
edge and apply conceal or bake so I'm
going to using the flat edge this part
here where that says to use I'm going to
press it in so playing it really really
nicely actually holy fuck I'm sorry but
this can't be my color I will not
fucking allow it so this is my face
looks like so far with just using
foundation this is what the sponge looks
like I will say that it did apply my
foundation pretty fucking nice like I
didn't take away any of my coverage it's
looking pretty fucking snatch I'm
actually really impressed so far and I
do like the fact that you can hold it
exist like I don't know if this makes
sense but I can I kind of grasp it with
my finger and press exactly where I want
it to be it's definitely more dense than
a Beauty Blender though because it is a
thicker sponge for we're sure it's
definitely thicker and more intense but
it is very very soft when it's soaked
and I'm not mad just whatsoever let's do
some concealer I don't even my classic
heart-shaped tape let's see a little bit
I'm running on a concealer agency go
underneath to be honest I thought the
under eye concealer probably the worst
because of the way to shake them like
there's no way it's gonna get underneath
there but it's actually going underneath
quite nicely I get going right to my
bottom lash line and the coverage is
still there it's not just fuck it's
blending out perfectly oh my god it's a
little hard to get to the inner inner
corner right here this part I feel is a
little tough to get into
also nothing I really like about this is
that because it is slanted on the edges
you can go like this and like kind of
really go up there and clean up the
contour on the nose because I like kind
of highlight the sides of the nose a
little bit as well that's really fucking
cool I will definitely say that okay so
I'm pleasantly surprised I'm not gonna
lie I feel like I'm usually pretty hard
on products and I do full reviews on
them this is actually impressing me so
go there a moment so now I'm take the
other side I'm gonna put powder on it
I'm going to go ahead and cook I'm just
gonna go ahead and apply powder and see
how the powder applies with a sponge and
it applied beautifully on my guys oh my
god it goes right up to the lash line
which means it goes right up to the
wrinkle increases which is really really
nice and then what you might think power
I'm gonna put it everywhere else that I
use the RCM a underneath the eyes
and I'm taking the cover effects for the
rest of the face and this is my face
completely set and bitch that shit is
fucking set to the ground I'm sorry I
can run out in the rain and be good you
guys gonna go finish the rest of my
makeup and I'll be back soon to tell you
guys what my final verdict is on this
one okay guys so I finished off my face
off of camera really quickly and I just
want to show you guys one more thing
before I give you the final review of
what I think about this I want to show
you guys how easy it is to bake with
this I mean this is called the cake and
bake for a good reason watch this
so my powder onto this and I'm going
with these sides I use the powder on and
do my normal baking like I would do like
underneath my chin and all my nose watch
this
if that isn't the easiest thing I've
ever done where I've done straight-line
easily okay easy is fuck okay guys the
final verdict on this a very Moana
kicking big sponge what I think about it
I honestly think that I love it I'm
honestly really shocked I like this
because I really didn't think I was
going to originally I was I saw it and I
was like what a gimmick man like that is
a gimmick I'm not gonna like it I don't
think I was like at all but I really
really do I love that it's like angular
I love that I can bake with it super
easily I love that it actually packs on
all my foundation perfectly I thought my
face looks really really nice and full
coverage and just the way I want it to
be and I'm like oh my god this bunch
actually worked and I love the fact that
it is soft but it's dead when you put it
onto the skin and pies really easily and
applies the full coverage really nicely
and it builds up coverage beautifully I
honestly don't really have too many bad
notes about this I wish it was a smidge
softer buzzer than that it's like great
I really think it's fucking fantastic it
really does work and if you guys want to
try it out I would definitely suggest
trying it out it's cheaper than the
beauty blender as well so it's like hey

video because had fun watching let me
