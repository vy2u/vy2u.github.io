what's up Manny anyway and welcome to my
channel thank you so much for being here
I really appreciate be honest going into
this 3 second brow eyebrow stamp
okay so it comes in this big-ass box of
course I don't have scissors me right
now like why would I
oh I've nail cutters it's get all bad
and Waring's okay so let's quickly read
up on this three-second eyebrow stamp
let's see how much it is and what it
does hmm these before and after Baker's
though sure okay so the three-second
brow eyebrow stamp is twenty dollars and
it comes in two shades it comes with a
dark and I like to medium and it comes
with two set of stamps it comes with a
arched brow any soft brow I'm more of an
arched brow kinda bitch music you guys
in to see what these brows look like and
what the fan looks like get into this
game okay steps we're reading the
instruction hand you want kids my knees
manual rub the step into the powder
until the sponge is sufficiently coated
with brow powder while looking in the
mirror align no stamp with your brow and
press firmly in the impression for three
seconds use the included spoolie brush
to grid of any excess powder around your
brow is this me or here my brows are
literally like too big for this so let's
see how this works out so we're gonna
using the darkest of the powder it's
right here I have black hairs so so
we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead
and get this damn and we're gonna Winkle
it said wiggle sufficiently coated that
bitch if that's not coated we're gonna
go in huh
ganya okay let's try I'm scared a little
okay okay
three seconds
hmm let me try the brush hold on it's
not unsavable so tied I'll decide first
shits and giggles I feel like we should
why don't we do the other shape on the
other side yeah I'm not really 100% sold
on it yet so let's see what we think on
this side what am I even trying to do
here cuz try it let's brush it out after
you spoolie it out there's definitely
some product in my brow but I don't know
about this guy's I don't know about this
I think that if you have less brow hair
than I have it might be easier to do
this and then fill in after just to have
a base shape that's why I could see it
working as honestly that's that's about
it this is my brows done like this is
then filled in with the product yeah I
didn't do much huh let me just do one
more stamp for health wealth and
happiness and let's see if it gives me a
shape like I want or not okay guys so I
have my opinion that on the lid do I
think that this is worth 20 bucks I
think it's actually kind of fun I think
it's fun to try out I think that if you
have less brow hair than I have and you
need a real good like stencil I think
that's actually pretty practical if you
guys want to try that hell I think
that's not practical that only has two
colors you see the black look / charcoal
or I'm light/medium but I do think that
if you have like no brow hair and you
need a stencil that I think it could
actually work I mean I definitely saw a
product being put down I see a shape
here like it definitely I'm sure I can
do something like it's not completely
 for me practically am I gonna use
this ever again no I do think it's fun
but I do not think it's the most
practical product for me personally but
if you have a really thin hair I'm it's
worth a try might as well try it out I
don't know what to think about this
does it work for me not really but could
it work for someone else they really
good totally good but yeah guys I love
you guys so much how grace of the night
or day where you guys are and I will
catch you guys in my next video bye you
