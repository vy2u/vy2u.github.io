today's video is going to be the rider
dye makeup tag this tag was created by
Jacqueline Hill and she's one of my best
friends on YouTube and she's all my best
friends in real life
I talked to her so so so Austin and
she's honestly just an amazing person I
love her so much
so when she tagged me in this tag I was
like dude of course I'm going to do this
I've just been out of town for so long
and I was like I need to film this when
I get back and I'm finally back home for
a little bit so let's go and film this
rider die tag I the reason I have no
makeup on is I thought it would be fun
to do my makeup with using my favorite
writer dye products I saw casting lights
do this on her channel she liked to get
ready using the writer guy favorite
product so I was like dude that's a
great idea I would love to show how the
products I love work so if you guys are
ready to watch that you guys want to see
what my ride-or-die products are my
riders eye makeup everything that I use
I cannot live without per likes lot of
item they keep on watching as always you
guys like this video if you guys don't
like me please don't watch you
know the drill with that but you guys do
like this video please give it a like
and a thumbs up and a comment or
whatever you guys would like to leave I
would really really appreciate it and if
you're new what's up I'm an emu a and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here I really preciate you
guys seriously you guys are freaking
awesome and if you're a returning maniac
see you so let's get into this rider
diet makeup tag slash get ready with me
okay let's start this mother okay
so first category what is my ride-or-die
primer it's the benefit Porefessional
guys honestly this is the one I've gone
through the most this is like og this
one
see this little rusev or thing this is
from when I worked at Sephora this is
like two years two and a half years old
like I'm not gonna use this money
because it's good enough Lee if I were
to use this to a girl one but this is
completely empty and it's just cool to
see like og history that I've been using
this for so long and it's
honestly still one of my favorite
primers ever I will not ever get over
that I just think it's amazing protein
for the primer in the t-zone this is one
of your premise because it is so poor
feeling you guys I am porous I got a lot
of porn I got a to work with you so
the reason I like it so much is because
it is so good at concealing pores and
giving me matte throughout the day and
it just feels absolutely amazing it has
that silicone slippery feeling and it's
great for people that are more on the
oily to normal side and of course if
your combination - so as you can see I'm
using it if I can living you know so
next is going to be my favorite
foundation of all time I think you guys
know what it is honestly I can't stop
Dior air flash foundation this
foundation is so good it's just so good
to me I just love it so much this is my
what is this maybe fourth bottle I've
gone through it's just such a good
foundation oh I feel like a like
I'm tagging but okay
okay so now that we have the entire base
on and this is what it looks like I just
think it looks so beautiful like it just
looks stunning man I can't I can't stop
this is such a pretty foundation it
leaves me nice and dewy and luminous and
just looks like really just good it's
good you know so now I'm not going with
my favorite and number one a ride-or-die
concealer I'm sure you guys have guessed
it or we're really really close to
guessing it this is the tart shaped aid
concealer I can tell you honestly even
though it's been more of a recent thing
this is definitely my ride-or-die this
is the one when I'm like the most scared
I'm gonna run out of because I have been
using it non-stop and I know any day now
it's gonna be gone and I'm gonna be like
it sold out everywhere I can't buy it
I'm gonna freak out so I was gonna take
a little bit of that underneath the eyes
a little bit of that hulago we doing
yeah right this is a full-coverage
beautiful ass concealer and I can't stop
using it honestly a really really close
race between this one and the Urban
Decay Naked weightless honestly it was
really really close but this one just
took it just a little bit farther
because I've never had to conceal like
this and I just think it works the best
that's really good and I'm gonna take
that same damp Beauty Blender and really
just kind of pounce this bad boy in this
is in the shade light by the way blends
out like a dream doesn't dry out it
really is so crease resistant I can't
even I can't even stop I kind of thought
okay if that make anything you know I'm
just pouncing to make sure I keep the
coverage there and I'm not swiping or
anything like that so for my rider diet
powder again you guys know this I think
is like the ultimate favorites I'm using
the laura mercier translucent powder you
guys it just honestly the best powder
I've ever found it just works so so so
well Kacie Mac all day long gives me a
beautiful almost like an extra little
amount of coverage I'm using is
underneath the eyes just to set
everything in place to make sure
everything is set with the Beauty
Blender it just works so good at baking
giving everything in place cook in total
it's good at Togo's I'm just go ahead
and press that translucent everywhere
with whatever brush you wanna use I'm
just gonna using this artiste brush to
really pounce
this bitch in to make sure that nothing
leaves us can't find a powder puff in
this room to save my life man so I have
to use a little more teeth and press
it and hang makes a nose red huh no no
the next little area of the writer dye
tag section was under I powder my
favorite ooh said honestly I use the
face powder to set my under eyes too I
use like the Laura Mercier translucent
or like the LA Perry so I don't really
have one for that but I do have an under
eye powder that is my favorite that I
always use and it is the instant Marc by
Marc Jacobs I use this underneath my
eyes all time not to really set but to
brighten everything up it's just my
favorite under-eye powder this is in the
shade 40 and I just like to put it
underneath my eyes because I feel like
it really does brighten up my eyes so
much without actually looking too yellow
you know ii mean i don't like it when
yellow powers actually look yellow I'm
like um can you Boyd that please so I'll
use this just to really help brighten up
the under eyes and it just looks so
pretty
yeah and I'll just take this on a morphe
M for 3/8 really just great under eye
powder brush powder it really will never
get old
honestly writer died for real I don't
you guys can tell on camera but in
person I can see that it is a lot
brighter underneath my eyes and it just
looks really smooth and airbrushed I
really love this be out here insta mark
you got a mirage filter allow ya man
can't a mucho so next what is my
favorite bronzer this was tough because
I was choosing between two but honestly
how to go with my gut and just go with
what I know
man this is the rider die hoola bronzer
by benefit you can't knock this bad boy
honestly it's been through so much with
me and it just it's been to all the
tears and with you all the heartbreak no
tears or heartbreak hmm I'm signals back
so I'm just using this on a more feet
are seven really nice fluffy bronzing
brush I'm gonna bronze up the skin I
just love this color so much it's very
very pigmented it blends out seamlessly
these are really really pretty a bronzed
effect and it's matte so it's not going
to be like a shimmery intense bronzer or
anything like that the cool thing about
this one too is that it's not too orange
and it's not too cool toned so it's
really nice neutral bronzer if you guys
see any patchiness on my forehead right
now it's because I'm actually sweating
and the sweat is causing my forehead to
be batchi it's not the products I
promise you you you just want sure I'm
really impressed with right now bitten
it's on Netflix it's such a hot
man I love about werewolves and
vampires and stuff
mmm there's some hot-ass characters in
it too I'm like oh I'm watching this too
late go ahead and take that instrument
one more time gonna clean up at the
bottom underneath the bronzer so it
looks a little bit sharper and cleaner
and not so blotchy and as you guys can
see the area that does not take pigment
okay right there
strikes again strikes again y'all I
can't can't avoid it guys that area just
does not love me and does not take
bigger it's my face and it's not the
product kind of sad next let's go in
with our favorite highlighting products
and I'll do blush last for like the face
ones for likes products I go on I think
I'm gonna go in with honestly this has
been like my favorite for a couple
months now I just work so absolutely
amazingly my ride-or-die for highlight
is these solstice sleek palette it just
works so good I'm so happy jock
introduced the whole entire YouTube
world to it because it honestly is so
 poppin and so bobbing right now
I'm in such a high lighting phase where
I love to be really blinding so I'll
take this shade right here just like
really pretty peach one on a more feet
art 12 like a little fan brush and I'll
just pack that bitch
all over this mug just really
just really start to put it on right
here as you can see amazing Hanna for
highlighters I was torn the most of all
the products I was like I can't just
pick one I can't pick one but I went
with a good choice
keep it low to not is just so freakin
pretty yeah boom glow today I'm
little oh thanks we have the highlight
of on with the bronzer on now my
ride-or-die blush if you guys are old
school manniac you guys know this is OG
like favorite blush of all time Becca
wild honey Becca wild mother pumpkin
honey bear I don't see this much just
honestly my favorite it's a beautiful
matte satin finish just works so well
it's a nice apricot bronze color this
hair is driving me crazy
just a nice really pretty apricot bronzy
color and it just looks so good on so
many different skin tones the line is so
complex you can use it as even bronzer
and like the deeper complexion can
definitely still wear this it looks so
beautiful
like just a flush of orange on cheeks
stunning blush stunning morphe for Becca
wild honey oh this looks so pretty this
little mirror so little gives
you okay that's right
oh this blush and it blends like a
 dream
I love apricot II orange blushes I just
really do I don't know what it is I just
think they're so beautiful
so time for the writer die setting spray
ultimate number one favorites I spray of
all time
Urban Decay all nighter this really does
actually help keep my makeup on a lot
longer when I use this it just works so
well and it really keeps you makeup on
like it has some alcohol in it I know
it's kind of annoying but hey the bitch
works so let's do a couple spritzes now
strong and that's it for the face look
and that is it for the entire face
that's going to move on to the next
products in this rider tag okay I am
back in my brows are filled and my eyes
are primed tag doesn't really have your
favorite brow products but I love the
anasazi eyebrow definer that's my number
one writer dye the brow definer is so
good that's why I use today and my
probably just looked pretty good when I
use it you know I mean so I'm gonna keep
using it but let's go ahead into what is
next
so we're number one a writer diet
favorite palette ever is honestly mine I
can't I can't stop I really honestly the
man um you a makeup geek palette is my
number one rider dye and I know it can
be impartial because the fact that I did
collaborate for this palette but I still
use it basically every single day and
you know what if you don't like it you
don't like this is my ride-or-die tub
mother titties because honestly
this is my number one rider dye palette
so I'm using this today on the eyes but
it's time to make normal everyday makeup
which basically would be using this I'm
gonna incorporate Geoffrey stars a
mint-condition on the lid cos it's
really wanted to try using that out on
the lid it's this shade right here it's
a really pretty mint shade so I think
I'm just gonna use that on the lid and
this guy everywhere else so let's go
ahead and do a really soft little cream
oh okay amazing so first things first
I'm gonna take beaches and cream
just this shader on her beautiful
transition shade very very chill nothing
too crazy gonna pop that into the crease
and just really start to create a Mike
snow transition for the shadows I'm
gonna be going in with next you guys
know me I'm a transition whore like I
need everything to be seamlessly blended
and I want it to be looking airbrushed I
want flawless and I want perfection and
luckily using a transition shade like a
beaches and cream is going to give that
to me so that's we're putting into the
crease higher up into the crease also
I'm not really being me with it
whatsoever because this shade is pretty
light so you can really get away with
just murder at this point yeah and I'm
just using the palette mirror for this
I'm happy out my pal has a mirror
honestly
so next I'm gonna go in with a frappe
which is this shade right here it's
really pretty just maple brown it's not
too too too warm it's not too cool it's
just a really nice neutral warmish Brown
put a put that into the crease with a
morphic M 4-3-3 this just going to add
some nice definition I'm going to put it
mostly on the outer corner and lightly a
blend in with the brush not putting a
lot of pressure on it whatsoever
odd makeup geek shadows man they blend
like a dream not all the way and keep my
eye open so I can see exactly where I
want to put the shades depositing less
pressure when I go farther in and then
between steps I'll blend without you 27
really pretty really easy I'm gonna be
so sad when my palettes out of
stock and it's gone me Mom I want
to looks really cute and blended and
just really prayer for me I'm gonna take
Jeffrey stars mint-condition
that's going to go all over my lid I
decided because it just looks like a
really pretty color and I haven't played
with a really pretty bright mint like
this in a very very long time let's go
up with this bad boy on
ooh I'm just pressing on yes
god I was thinking on my finger because
I just feel like if you guys just work
really great sometimes especially with a
formula like this where it's very foiled
and intense so your eye should look
something like this it's a nice really
just pretty mint on the lid nice warm
transition I don't think it looks so
cute oh this mitt looks pretty ok go I'm
gonna do a little bit of eyeliner really
really quickly and I will be right back
ok cool so we have the eyeliner on now
which is a nice just cute little wing
nothing too intense nothing to him just
really pretty thing hmmmm so because I
wanted to focus mainly on the mint
shadow on the lid I want to keep it very
very pretty and soft I'm taking morphe
36 y 36 and I'm gonna take the shape
frappe again I'm gonna blend out
underneath the lash line and keep it
very very lightweight nothing to him I
want to keep this very lightweight
underneath here because the focus again
is on the mint and I don't want to stay
on the mint taking that same brush i'ma
take the shade Artemis and pop that on
the inner corner of my eye just to kind
of help awaken everything up a little
bit more a little bit on the brow bone
to you Gorge not that to my own horn but
 that's nice now take any
nude liner I'm going to be taking the
Tarte inner rim liner in the shade nude
like I think it and I put that in the
waterline just kind of help open up the
eyes a nice nude cream color liner will
help awaken of the eyes see so for my
ride-or-die mascara I had to go with my
Bennett roller lash man this is the
mascara try to ensure I've gone through
three or four tubes of these it just
works so beautifully I really curling
and lifting the latches and keeping the
curl up and I really just like that you
know what I mean so that's what we're
gonna use today this is a new tube to
feel so happy I'm gonna curl my lashes
I'm gonna be putting falsies on anyway
so I'm curling for the of it
a little bit on the bottom - and now for
the writer dye pair of lashes you guys
knew you guys knew this was gonna happen
new bouncing Bella new bouncing Bella's
guys these are my oh gee like original
badass obsessed with lashes and they're
very flirty very intense they're more of
a dramatic pair for sure so it's gonna
apply some of the New Belgium Bella's
real quick and this is what the lashes
look like on the eyes again they're very
dramatic very flaring break wispy but
they're so freakin stunning no man I
can't stop with these ones these are
just too good to me so I know this is
really not part of the tag but my
favorite lip liner of all time number
one mitered eye lip liner NYX peekaboo
neutral you guys knew that was correctly
if you're an original manniac like a
couple hundred thousand subs like 100 to
200 thousand you guys will know that
peekaboo neutral by NYX is like my
favorite lip liner of all time it's so
beautiful and perfect like the perfect
pinky nude shade that works with so many
things so it's going lip line with these
this is what the lip liner looks like
it's just such a beautiful color man
come on oh that's oh gee that is og
write or die lipstick number one writer
die the home was actually this is really
hard to pick a number one writer dye
lipstick by how'd it go with lover of my
life it is Mac myth Mac myth and I go
way way back this is my second tube and
I'm about to be done with my second tube
- so yeah Mac myth dude it's too good
it's too good to me it's like the most
nude lipstick I own honestly it's just
so pretty man honestly I can't stop with
Mac myth what I usually do is I would
just literally wear Mac myth by itself
all the time or what I do is put kind of
sexy and then Mac myth on top of it just
to really mix my own really pretty nude
shade and it'll just be so perfect and I
loved it but honestly number one is Mac
man a favorite gloss ever ride-or-die
gloss is Marc Jacobs French tickler this
one and sugar sugar on my number two
favorite ever but I do like the fact
that this adds a little bit of a peachy
tint to it and I just like a good peach
on the lips it just really flatters a
lot of people so let's add on top of
this a little bit of that
I don't talk about a little bit Eddie
okay
mannequin by Jeffrey star number one
liquid lipstick ever it's so mannequin

my skin tone it just looks like honestly
perfection I've worn it so many times

look like in it last but not least I
want to do a favorite scent because
Jacqueline did a favorite perfume but I
don't really have I mean I do wear
perfume too sometimes I like to mix
cologne and perfume and I create like
more of a custom like manly / feminine
scent because I feel like I'm a very
manly / feminine kind of guy my favorite
cologne ever is Gucci Guilty I wear this
all the time I wear this all the time
like whatever I'm doing mean greets or
any look at that how much left is in
there a little nugget so my third bottle
