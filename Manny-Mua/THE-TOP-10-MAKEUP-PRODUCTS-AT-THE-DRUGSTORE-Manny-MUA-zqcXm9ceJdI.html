today's video is going to be my top 10
favorite drugstore beauty products I
have been recently really getting into
drugstore makeup I have been trying my
hardest really dive in and start using
drugstore products more I love you guys
know this but a lot of guys don't when I
started in makeup I started working at
Sephora right away I didn't get a really
experience with any other makeup other
than the brands at Sephora and then
right at just before I started working
at Mac so I really never gave drugstore
products a chance I never bought
drugstore products I wasn't the person
that would use makeup when I was 10
years old and was buying L'Oreal and
Maybelline that wasn't me that was in my
journey so I had to really experiment
with drugstore makeup after going from
like Sephora and Mac to drugstore so it
has been a journey going from high-end
products to drugstore products and
that's why a lot of time people will
kind of give me shit for being bitchy
the drugstore makeup or for being
surprised when they work and it's not
even that it's literally just me being
shocked at the fact that this product
that is five dollars works better than a
product that's fifty dollars and that
really does shock me and I'm like whoa
dude how the fuck do they make this
happen and I just honestly my genuine
reaction when I'm shocked and surprised
I'm sorry if it comes across as me being
a fucking bitch or whatever it may be if
you guys think I'm a bitch then hey
that's your call but I don't think I am
so I'm just gonna continue to do what
the fuck I keep doing this is actually
really hard to accumulate I was shocked
at how many products I really actually
loved from the drugstore it was hard to
just make this ten and I'm like what the
fuck I'm thinking maybe I should do a
series on my channel like top 5
drugstore concealers top 5 drugstore
foundations I'm thinking about doing
something like that because this was
really hard for me to pull and that was
a good sign and I'm like yo that means I
like a lot of drugstore products I want
to talk about more ducts or products
with you guys so yeah guys that's a zero
is going to be as always if you guys
don't this view if you guys do not like
me please don't fucking watch it you
know the drill with that but you guys
like this video please subscribe to my
channel if you are not already and if
you're new what's up a mani Mui and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here I really appreciate it
from the bottom I heart con todo mi
corazon me encanta mucho
I guess exerted the vagary let's get
into this top 10 drugstore products
video
so let's quickly talk about base
products first these are my top three of
base products on here so by the way guys
I'm not gonna be going in full depth
intense crazy talking about every single
product like three minutes each I don't
want this video to be so fucking long
I'm gonna talk about them quickly and
you guys have definitely seen these
products on my channel before so to me a
quick movement keep it going keep it
flowing kind of thing so first product
is going to be the Loreal Pro matte and
fallible foundation I'm in the shade of
103 I love this foundation because it
stays on all day keeps me matte
throughout the day I put it in my t-zone
mostly and just kind of let it set into
the face and it just looks so beautiful
it is a matte finish but it's not like
Superman where I look like littering no
moisture on my skin left the coverage is
amazing the finish is amazing the
longevity is amazing I really don't
think you can go wrong with the Loreal
Pro matte infallible foundation it's
fucking sick nasty like thick nasty
second product is another foundation it
is by wet and wild
hmm this is the wet wild photo focus
foundation you guys okay I just recently
started using this I'm actually wearing
this on my face today I really really
really really like this foundation I
think that the finish is really pretty
it's like a satin matte finish more so
on the matte side on my face it looks a
little bit more matte than into satin
but it does look beautiful on the skin
the coverage is a nice medium to full
it's buildable I was so shook when I
first tried this out I honestly was
shocked the first time I ever tried this
was in my wet and wild one brand
tutorial and I used it so many times
since because I really wanted to give it
more of a chance and enter being one my
favorite drugstore foundations ever like
I absolutely love it the little paddle
thing kind of weirds me out
it's I get a little paddle and I wish I
was like in a squeezy tuber and a pump
but I think for five bucks usually I
really don't think you can go wrong the
one thing I don't like about this is a
smell I think it smells like straight-up
fucking paint as if I literally just
dripped paint from a scaffolding onto my
face it literally smells like that and I
hate the smell so much I mean it goes
away and the finish is beautiful and
it's really well worth it for six bucks
come on
I can end a little can a little bit of
paint okay number three is this by
Maybelline this is the Maybelline fit me
concealer this is it was actually the
concealer part was the hardest I
actually like a lot of concedes from the
drugstore but you can see that was so
hard but I have to say that this one is
my favorite one this works so nicely
it's a nice medium coverage you can
build it up to be more full coverage the
Finn
is beautiful on the skin it blends out
so nicely and it doesn't crease crazy on
me once I said it quickly it just looks
like a beautiful ass concealer reminds
me like the NARS radiant creamy
concealer and in a way in a way it's not
the same it doesn't have as much
coverage as an arse one does but it does
remind me a lot of that so if you guys
are a huge fan and they NARS one how
doesn't just check this out to see it is
a very very similar similar type of
concealer and I just absolutely love it
so much the one thing I will say about
these those I wish that the shade range
was was more vast I'm like dude this is
such a popular ass concealer at the
drugstore how they not have like twenty
shades I don't understand but I hope
Maybelline does come out with more
colors with this and it will rule the
fucking world item number four is this
this is the Physicians Formula butter
bronzer this has gotten some love I love
this bronzer so much it smells like a
fucking tropical oasis oh my god it
smells like my fucking like my taint but
honestly it's absolutely amazing I think
that the color is beautiful the
pigmentation itself is beautiful the
finish is really nice too it's not
completely matte again it's another
satin like glowy finish I had seen this
floating around so many places all over
YouTube and people were like dude this
is the best problems ever from the
drugstore I'm like okay let me try it I
actually really love it and I haven't
found a bronzer at the drugstore that I
like as much as this one if you guys
like bronzer if you guys like a nice
glowy bronzy finish if you guys just
like to look a little more pan and not
so pale then out of Li suggests B
Physicians Formula butter bronzer it's
fucking bomb so I was like coconut it
smells like literally smells like pina
colada mmm so like my fucking childhood
fool product number five is this this is
the Milani make it last setting spray I
talked about this before on my channel
and I think it's absolutely fucking bomb
so this drugstore setting spray works as
if it's urban decay I'm not kidding you
it works so fantastically it does have a
lot of alcohol in it though it's a
second ingredient which means it's the
second highest ingredient in the
ingredient deck but I will say that this
really does keep your makeup on so much
longer I'm wearing it on my face today
it's Pritz out so nicely as well I do
think it's weird that it's perfumed it
literally smells like perfume I think
that's kind of odd that it smells like
perfume but honestly like as you can see
I've gone through a good hefty amount
about use it so often I wish it was more
product in here it only has 2.3 fluid
ounces but I can travel with it in the
tsa won't get mad at me so if you guys
are looking for a good setting spray
from the drugstore Milani make it last
setting spray balm
okay guys the product number six is this
little bad bitch right here this is from
L'Oreal this is the L'Oreal infallible
24-hour eyeshadows I talked about these
before guys oh this is what they look
like they're like this these are some of
the most beautiful drugstore shadows in
1949 for drugstore they're just amazing
eyeshadows in general let me just saw
and swatch I every time I swatch these I
can't get over how nice they are
these are my favorite drugstore shadows
of all time they're absolutely amazing
this is in the shade amber rush it's a
beautiful rose gold you guys these
shadows last so long on the eyes they
don't crease the crease resistant they
give you a metallic intense finish and
they have such a great color range as
well I left all my fellow shadows at
home in San Diego and try to go out and
buy another one this is an amber rush
but I just want to show you guys that
this is such a good fucking shadow
they're a little pricey for a drugstore
shadow but it is drugstore and it's
worth it and the quality is so there man
item number 7 are these guys these are
from Maybelline these are the color
sensational lipsticks I'm not gonna go
into too much detail about these because
I talked about them so so many times in
my channel I had to put these in here
these are some of the best lipsticks at
the drugstore i've ever came across
they're so shockingly pigmented they
feel so comfortable on the skin this is
in the shade beige gray this is my
favorite color
that they've ever done yeah oh yeah the
bath / but it's hard to swatch like this
this is actually the shade I'm wearing
right now babe with a little bit of
gloss on top it's just such a perfect
color honestly guys these are better
than some of the high-end lipsticks that
I own the Maybelline Color sensational
line are absolutely amazing lipsticks
check them out at the drugstore like six
or seven bucks you cannot go wrong item
number eight is by wet n wild again they
have been killing it for me when Wilde
has highlighters and they're
highlighters are probably the best
highlighters from the drugstore I've
ever ever experienced they're so nice
this is in the shade crowded my canopy I
don't know why that shade is makes me
laugh
so that's a shade right here crying on
my canopy I'm not saying that this shade
is my favorite it's definitely not high
like other shades that they have more
but when wild really
did that with fucking highlighters they
really did that I don't know what is in
here what kind of crack witchcraft is in
these products but they're so nice and
they're so pigmented and they give you
such a beautiful intense shine to the
skin you guys are looking for good
drugstore highlighters are not gonna
break the bank that will look beautiful
on the skin and sit beautifully on the
skin check out the wet-and-wild
illuminating powders you will not be
disappointed at all product number nine
is this bad bitch right here this is
from Maybelline this is the colossal Big
Shot mascara I just want to talk about
this really quickly because not only did
I do the campaign with Maybelline on
this being the ambassador for this
mascara but this truly is the best
drugstore mascara I've ever personally
tried it makes my lashes look so full so
intense so fluffy honestly the whole
experience with Maybelline becoming one
of their ambassadors and repping this
mascara has been such a great experience
for me and I can't thank them enough and
honestly I couldn't be more proud to
wrap a product that actually works so
well and that I'm really actually really
proud of and last but not least is
another wet and wild product after I do
that one brand wet-and-wild product
video like my world was turned upside
down like that one pokemon in Super
Smash that makes your fucking thing like
this worst I want to talk about this
really quickly because I absolutely live
for it's the blush I mean right now this
is the color icon blush in the shade
pearlescent pink I'm wearing it on my
cheeks right now you guys this blush for
some reason has been like the blush I've
been wearing the last two weeks in a row
I don't know why it's so good but it is
it just feels so nice on the skin it's
like better than some of the high-end
blushes I've tried I'm like how how the
way that this applies is so beautiful it
blends out to literally perfection I
don't know how they do it I don't know
what I'll does editing this shade is
like an apricot pink shade that has a
little bit of golden reflect in it kinda
reminds me like NARS orgasm but a much
more subdued version of it it's much
more apricot and not as glittery but
this is what it looks like right here
it's just a beautiful ass shade and that
is it you guys that's it for the entire
video of my top 10 drugstore beauty
products these ten products I literally
stand behind so strongly I think they're
absolutely amazing they work great on my
skin if they don't work on your skin I'm
sorry the fucking sucks you know
everyone's skin is kind of different but
these products work
me fantastically and I really don't
think you can go wrong if you guys went
out and bought any of these ten I'm like
