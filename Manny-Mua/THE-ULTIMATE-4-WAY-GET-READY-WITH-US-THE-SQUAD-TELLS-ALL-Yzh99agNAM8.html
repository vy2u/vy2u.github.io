for each other but don't come from I did
someone coming in our group in like
trying to like comfort no you can't make
fun of Laura you can't make fun of Manas
textured skin can't make fun of Gaby's
rolling contact I don't ever really
covered the try I'm excited for you in a
way I'm excited to see last of you our
wig was very interesting that was one of
my rougher moment it's fine you came
from it's generous okay look how I'm
still soul mani mani
okay what are you saying
that's right he was like you have to
have your text message okay I would say
that Oh
Daniel Daniel okay yeah actually
Oh looking
my spill the beans
ooh that I went to was that one night
okay that was a spur-of-the-moment
situation okay when I came out in the
beginning when I first time I when I was
younger I had to go to like anti-gay
counseling how old Reid I was like 17
maybe 16 because I parents like didn't
really know what to do they were really
confused and they're like do you want to
go to counseling for and I was such a
people-pleaser like and they're so like
confusing they don't really know what to
do and I'm like I'll do whatever it
takes for them like cuz they're like oh
like obviously even back then too like
what like almost 10 years ago it was so
much harder like even gates to be in the
screams yeah like let alone like they're
really just scared for like yeah they
didn't want that for me so over six
month every Monday after school I would
go I started like kind of changing in a
weird way like I got it I went to like a
depression and my parents like kind of
like approach me they're like what it's
like going on like what's wrong like why
are you like why aren't you like acting
yourself like why aren't you being like
the man you we know like I was very like
carefree loving like how I've always
come a bit I was like in this like weird
funk where I like didn't really want to
talk to anyone or like I was just like
in my own head you know and so basically
I told my was like honesty I think it's
take the counseling I feel like I'm
letting you guys down cuz it's not
changing I still feel the exact same way
I've been doing it for six months and
you were actually trying and I was
trying like my heart is and I really
couldn't like I didn't know what to do I
was like I don't know how to change like
it was just such a hard thing for me to
comprehend my parents are like what we
want like our old son back don't say
they're like just don't go to come to me
more like we'll just like figure it out
his family and so we did and luckily
like now where we at now my parents both
work with me and so I'm like so lucky
and like so blessed that I meet guys
like works at now but it wasn't so hard
it's not even like they're like we don't
want you to know we don't know what to
do girl because seeing them now how much
they love you and support you I don't
feel like that kind of love and support
can come from someone who hated that
part no I think they were just confused
so we were getting past the me being a
thing right it was like basically a
Don't Ask Don't Tell in my house I'm
like my parents knew what the situation
was but they were like still very unsure
and they really know what was going on
so I don't really ever talk about
because I wanted anyone feel comfortable
so I just like kind of like hid my life
a little bit from them I just like I hid
like my Instagram like all that stuff I
do remember the day that my parents
found out I had a Manny employ Instagram
one of the worst days ever heard of my
chart life oh where were you at
career-wise oh I just started like at
ten dozen folders and I had my photos
like posted in drag it on like I like
not only was like not only was I like
doing many anyway like I was in drag too
cuz I'd probably see you guys know that
like started in drag so my pants like a
poach me they're like what is this like
I was so shocked because I was actually
going out like I was would be going out
to the club I was gonna show cuz they're
like what is this under like delete it
no they didn't know that all my family
blog they already like I don't want
anybody to see you there my church
Mormon family yeah exactly they don't
like their church people to know like
they don't want them to like have to
deal with all of that and like obviously
didn't want them to have to deal with it
either
yeah and that's gonna always and that's
why I didn't come out to like my other
extended family for so long I didn't
come out to my brothers my mom told my
brothers and honestly like I am more v
buoyant now so imagine like me being in
like high school I wasn't even me even
now I'm like I would even say I'm the
most flamboyant like dude so it's like
imagine me even being less and less and
less me I had a full panic attack I had
like breathing to a paper bag almost
fainted like the whole thing when I
asked you are you trying to be a girl
like what suppose what's going on the
first thing when it went like one for
parents
no like you're like okay you wanna puke
garlic yeah like wanna be the football
players in about your identity and I'm
like you're so you know I'm still
getting to know who I am I was I was I
fell in love with it and honestly I
didn't get to experience really gay
people anymore time at the California
yeah yeah so that's why I think it's so
funny when people try to be like oh
you're like little squad is like girl
all just kind of join together we've
been with each other for so many years
it's like one of those things where like
we recognize we have real people maybe
we don't have a hundred thousand friends
maybe always hanging our buddies with
each other but it's like it's really put
it you almost like we have too many
friends and you're not not like
connected to any well you're not really
Freddie took off almost like too many I
feel so lucky like I was like all like
knowing each other we're at all okay I'm
like all getting a motel
and my mom was gonna get our tubes tied
Oh dirty wait the appointment to do it
can you imagine going into the
appointment of course yeah yeah I wonder
if the universe put us together and that
way because we really yeah okay Megan
here we go gonna be and they obviously
would listen to me like all the time I
would be like okay guys let's play a
game okay let's play game and they're
like okay cool let's do and I'm like
whoever gonna pick up all the stuff off
my floor first wins like in my room
what were they were bragging rights of
winning yeah Aaron was like four because
eight I was 12 that's like the timing
like it probably was and I'd be like oh
my go okay who's gonna race and do it
I'll just make it to a race in to get
fun so we saw how much this day be like
we're so that I don't like you
guys we had to pay somehow and then
happen and now it's the fun story I
didn't really speak English until like
third grade
yeah so like it was like obvi yeah like
I was like the guy was in ESL so I was
learning it both of my parents are
immigrants so they immigrated here from
Mexico oh yeah the first generation John
first generation Mexican I drew up with
parents who didn't know English so of
course I didn't know English I love my
voice deep in so when I speak Spanish
dude mine too like it hella deep and I
don't know what it is but my my happens
as well effect hi everyone I'm give us
more and that's like one of those coma
sensory or whatever like depends for
some reason I feel like people always
like I'm gonna do speaking Spanish cause
it's like so sexy you know like I don't
know a lot of people say that I wasn't
really speaking English right I was like
learning it that's like farther along
yeah so like in third grade was the
first year
my think that many people probably
wouldn't know is that I was like really
rough when I was younger to the point
where I was like constantly getting like
stitches like oh like a rough house yeah
but not rough housing but like I just
would always get in like really bad
situations when I was yeah I was really
rough cuz I think I'll so luckily having
the brothers to those yeah that's how
the brother and my two older sisters
were very like crazy defenders to so
much older your sisters my oldest my
brothers close as an agent spiders what
role did you were really be God the
youngest and they were really Mulder and
I think that's why I've always had like
an older mentality because I grew up
with them yeah I grew up with them and
they were always you know like for me
like my first accident or whatever that
happened was I was a gone like this like
chair thing and I was like waving bye to
my dad through the window and it went
from under me and I like full of garlic
and I smacked my face down and I bit
through my oh my whole bottom lip
completely was my teeth were like stop
no I do I do want a scar like it took
away my dirt you can't like yeah it's a
super super under there yours are both
like clumsy I collect weird I'm like I'm
not I'm very aware of that
me too never in your life like I've
never broken a bone
my mom is legitimately cool Mexican
mushy and mom is crazy party girl from
LA and then she moved off to Oklahoma to
start basic training because my parents
were from the military it's really
that's where they met and my dad fresh
immigrant from Vietnam to Oklahoma
that's where his whole family grew up
Europe from 12 children which is a crazy
like my mom being like this crazy like
I'm party girl kind of like me and like
you know just coming to like middle of
nowhere Oklahoma
then you know obviously she's so pretty
so like I'll be like aviation people all
they're like people are already living
so tan like from LA dad is just like so
foreign that like him dorka li like kind
of hitting on her and like being like
and these cookies we got is really like
four oh yeah yeah like she totally end
up getting bitch
you want to have like then have the best
life possible we're going to focus on
them as much as you can but when you
can't focus on lose your focus on
something you pay the most attention to
detail and other and I also feel like
it's been like a big journey like the
Nikita when like you can obtain that
back like like like Manny I'm never seen
in my life in a true okay I've seen you
in pretty much every always in a good
mood
to review light in the whole room like
