are you guys doing I feel like I've not
filmed in a fucking while it's been a
fucking minute I miss you guys have you
guys been I hope you guys have been
doing fantastic it is what are we in
right now we're in March now fuck you
guys this month is passing by literally
in two days I'm having my first branch
shoot like my first actual branch it for
my own first product I'm coming out with
I'm so excited like hmm I'm so anxious
I'm so nervous but I think it's gonna go
really really well and I cannot wait
like it's just so crazy to see like
things coming together finally and just
like how life is just like fucking crazy
and time is just like so precious and
last week I was out of commission the
entire week because I've been I was
working on a project that's gonna be
coming out soon as well so I'll keep you
guys posted on that which is a super
super cool project yeah anyway and we
stop rambling I wanted to do it this
video today I bought this lash kit on
lash safai and I bought it for like a
hundred and thirty dollars and I'm not
kidding this definitely has to be the
most expensive lash I've ever bought in
my entire life $130 for a little lash
kit I was floored I was blown away I was
like bitch world's most expensive
watches right here yeah I was shocked to
the core and I'm like okay this better
be something sickening it's like a very
very weird innovative type of lash
situation going on so I thought I'd be
really fun to try it out for the first
time here on my channel and let's see
how it works see how it looks
I'm very intrigued by it Berrien chewing
kind of like waited out but more so in
Jenin as always if you guys don't like
this video if you guys do not like me
please don't fucking watch it you know
let your what but you guys do like this
video please go ahead and give this
video a thumbs up and subscribe to my
channel if you're not already you will
not regret it I have my fucking guy's
bitch like I'm cool promise you I
promise anyway let's go and try out this
lash defy control kit and see what the
why the fuck is this bitch one hundred
and twenty seven hundred thirty seven
dollars
these guys so I bought the control kit
which retails for 125 dollars basically
it is a do it yourself at home
eyelash extension kit some very very
very intrigued it to say the least
look at this case took a whole case that
comes with it okey it's a moment like
it's an actual moment in here holy shit
left right that's fine we have a little
lash tool this is cool I like I thought
it comes with like a bunch of shit with
it okay well anyway you guys we're just
gonna kind of take it willy-nilly and
see how we use this cuz I'm not gonna
like look up how to use it exactly just
cuz I want to see how user-friendly this
actually is it includes a lash fi fuse
control one to gossamer lash sets which
is like the actual lashes whisper light
flexible bond and steel and finish clear
coat let's see what we do here so it's a
start with cleaning dry lashes I don't
have clean like I have dry lashes
they're dry right now but they're not
technically clean except mascara on not
knowing that they were going to not want
me have mascara on that's super weird
but I'm gonna keep the mascara on and
apply whisper light flexible bond
underneath the base of your natural lash
underneath the base of my lashes okay do
not brush all the way through the lash
ends just stab the brush across your
lash man it will have about two minutes
working time before you must add more
light bond coating is one of three days
of lash wear whoa whoa whoa so as it's
gonna be like really intense and hard to
take off okay we have sealant finished
clear coat and we have whisper light
flexible bond okay let's just do a
little a little bit at the base fucking
years ago pick up my mascara I'm scared
okay hold on I'm a mascara okay so I
took off as much mascara as I could
without taking off my makeup at the top
I mean I to go some makeup it's fine
it's totally good we're gonna try this
out I'm very curious at this point now
I'm like very like okay this looks like
the right one to me so we're gonna put
that the base of our lash band okay
base of our lash band I have about two
minutes to make it work so I have that
down now let's take our little weird
applicator right here I want to take our
right side lash safai lash side you just
you just yank him off you doesn't yank
on oh my god I'm so intrigued okay so
put them underneath our lashes
oh my god I got one on my guys is so
sticky though fuck me okay hold on okay
another one on okay you need be real
fucking careful because these things
break so easily like be very careful I
mean it's definitely working technically
it's definitely working
but fuck this is like a like this is a
process like this takes a minute I mean
I can definitely tell there's lashes
there that's up me how long five minutes
for one and it's like delicate and
honestly I had a lot of trouble trouble
doing it and I don't oh honey
yeah this is gonna be a no a hard no and
now it's like my lashes are so fucking
sticky from that little weird glue okay
so I don't know how much getting lash
extensions are but this is $125 for this
whole kit and you have to do it yourself
and it's actually so fucking hard so if
you guys know places are not as
expensive and you don't have to do it
yourself and you they probably last way
way way way longer than 1 or 4 days you
know Dudley's are just just going and
getting it done cuz this oh my god my
eyelash is so sticky like oh just do it
seal and finish clear coat no I don't
want to seal it in absolutely not I'm
not gonna seal it because I need to take
this ugly shit off it just doesn't like
it's just not my thing
you know maybe if you guys are like into
this kind of thing like this natural
like wispy look maybe you would be down
but for me I wanted to look bold and
dramatic and having 125 bucks yeah I
want them to look like contine I mean
he's just a plastic Ian like not cute
they look kind of cool from the top not
gonna lie but they just a plasticy in
there that plastic you shine and they're
not even lifted yeah no this is just not
gonna work for me okay guys for me this
was more of a flop situation because I
don't like a look
it was actually really hard to do and
it's too expensive for what it is I
think that's the gag is that it's 125
bucks I personally think it's very very
expensive for the whole entire little
kit for you to only basically get like
two sets of lashes 125 bucks with some
clear gel and shit I just don't think
that's really worth it so I'm gonna go
and say that this was more of a miss you
guys enjoy getting lash extensions I
want to do it yourselves then maybe you
guys might want to try it out and see
how it works sure some people will
definitely definitely like it but for me
personally it just was more of a flop I
wouldn't I can't suggest you guys to buy
it so that's just my personal opinion I
hope you guys enjoyed today's video I
had so much fun creating it I really
just can't just take them off like this
what I really have to soak them well did
want to like yeah that would be such a
fun innovative thing that's why I even
bought it just to try it out and see
what I thought about it it's not the
most user friendly thing ever and I
think you guys can just go get your
lashes done getting like lash extensions
yourself I bet would be like the same
price but way less work and way less of
a struggle so how is it just going to
get lash extension yourself and don't
buy them online trying to make them
fucking happen coz god damn that's not
don't work that's you guys later I love
you guys okay so the night or day
whatever you guys are and I'll catch you
in my next video bye MA hey guys welcome
back to my channel
hmm oh yeah all that huh oh my god got
one on yeah I want to scream I want to
scream I want to scream I can't do it
for me personally if you guys are
enjoyed getting lash extensions I wanted
to and um oh my god like I literally
want to scream you guys understand how
am I gonna take this off hmm no no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
