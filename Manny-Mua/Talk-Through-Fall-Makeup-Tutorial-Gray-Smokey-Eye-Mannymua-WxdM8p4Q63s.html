this very gray tone like cool tone blue
blue tone very cool tone like kind of
cool in the eyes a little bit of warmth
in lip creams and I have like this Rose
lip color thing on and they come out
really cool
you don't really awesome and I think
this is a really cool cool fall look
still because that's not like warm tone
to it a little bit of warmth but it
sounds like that depth and that gray and
then when it's gonna be firing on a lot
of people because gray is just like a
universal neutral color and as long as
you've had some brown some warm Browns
in there to kind of blend it out it'll
be beautiful
um I'm sadly gonna have a lot of
bloopers in this cuz I'm pretty sure
that I fucked up a lot I'm sorry but um
yeah probably guys like it I just always
have a fucking brush with me at all
times I'm talking I'm just like I need
to be animate stay watching you guys
want to see how I got this done if you
guys don't like it don't fucking watch
it you know the journal don't wash that
you feel like it cool but uh yeah other
than that probably like subscribe do
your thing I love reading the comments
so keep doing bashing and I'll talk to
you later bye you guys
do you find her I love you I love you
guys too but I love the viewfinder a lot
too
oh my god you guys seriously if you can
see this pimple right now it's not even
funny it's like it's so painful I mean I
have full coverage on and I have Studio
Fix powder on top and it's still there
don't look at it if you look at it it'll
grow so don't okay
drop your lid peach we're gonna prime
our lids with the pro longwear Mac
concealer let's go all of our islands
you know the drill
I always use this bad boy so I'm not
gonna really explain why I'm using it
damn we're using me because it is a
great great base for our shadows takes
away any redness from our lids and it
leaves us just as bling canvas to work
with
and it's creature die just fuck on my
brow beat she fucking brow oh my god
Manuel you it's not funny
I'm I have to edit that shit out
cool prime lens I'm thinking we're gonna
do like a gray smokey eye like a cool
tone gray smokey do these ooh we're
gonna go in with peaches and cream by
makeup geek my favorite favorite
transition shade of all time it's
peaches and cream by Omega P I swear to
you if you're like an NC and W 15 to 40
you can use this as your transition it
is literally like just look it has like
a very like beige aeon peachy undertone
to it so any color that you want to
blend out this is the color to do it
uh-huh it's a little bit lighter than
peach smooth that's another really
popular transition shade from makeup
geek this was just a little bit lighter
than that and going in with a 224 style
rebel and putting that in our crease
very lightly as you can see that you
don't like have a lot of color there
that's kind of what I want I want it to
just be a transition color especially me
doing a smoky eye
we need a transition or get done fucked
up now let's see we're going with frappe
I make a V cauliflower and a 2:17 style
brush nothing go in our outer corner and
our green
in the close fantastic it's not too warm
it's not too too cool
I just a great neutral Brown that's
gonna be great to lend in some other
colors into what's that called again
frappe you're doing it for me oh you're
doing it pack that bad boy in outer
corner blend into that beaches and cream
I'm sorry if you guys can't hear me that
well my fans going because it's hot as
fuck in this d now as you can see it's
not very blended get that 224 by port
224 right now is fucked up because I
like sad army I'm sorry for
mmm now let's blend now we're gonna go
in with away
we're to go in with Coco bear I'm a kivi
another one of my all-time faves on
clack into 24 I am just having bloom and
the to type 217 brush we're gonna pack
that bad boy in the outer corner and put
it lower into our crease then the fret
pick a lot and this okay you can go all
the way into it and recorder with this
one well kind of into the inner corner
look I'm not going to go too too far in
we're going to go pretty far because
we're going to still have that gray
color down and this is going to bring
some warmth back into it some more back
into that Sheen and then blame it as
cool 24 outwards blend outwards that
kind of gives you like that lifted out
for its thing
yeah oh wow welcome pretty good now
we're going to go in with mocha I make a
beak looks lie lean and I know it seems
like I'm using a lot of colors but
honestly when it comes to smokey eyes
like I've as I've said before it's all
about the transition that's like the
most important part in my opinion making
it look like it's very really faded and
hidden in it really for heavy it's all
about that transition okay pack that
mocha from the outer corner into our
lashes a little bit huh this is mostly
gonna go on the far corner swept in a
little bit
you can take it out if you want to as
well I don't try that crispy trick let
me see
Rosie this works okay probably works but
I can doing it the first time crispy I
believe you I'm just not gonna try it
right now but I believe you if that it
works can I love you get that 224 blend
it all out a little bit now we're gonna
go in with a little flat brush and
stealth if I make a big it just like
this color is really badass because it's
like a it's like a gray silver that's
what my blueness to it I don't even know
if the camera can tell but it's fucking
sick this is the first time I'm using it
on my lid so we'll see how it goes I'm
pretty sure it's something go for any
wall I'll do this one so I'm gonna got
that bad boy on here just it up to extra
cuz I really think I'm tan and pack that
on are Lynn you know ooh stop it I like
this a lot pack that bad boy all the way
up to the Browns of you I'm going on oh
my mom 18mm
when I ask my god you guys whenever you
have full face on you have to itch are
you just like please I don't want to
edge on one fuck up my makeup
why is this color so badass I don't
understand gray cool that you're some
team go back in with Coco a bear and
we're going to blend that stealth color
with the rest of the spills go now go go
away cool
okay so with that we put that bad boy
there and now the important part is
being a popcorns blend the cocoa bear
into the rest of the clothes that we
have down first to give you that
gradient move oh my god this looks so
cool that's a good gray brown smokey I
got got warm I got that cool hmm love it
okay so now I want to make even more
smoking and as you guys have seen I do
this literally all the time
get the LA Colors jumbo pencil in black
it's bland
we put down the bottom one waterline you
don't need to be very neat with this at
all
we're just gonna smoke the bitch out
anyway isn't this still that isn't this
beautiful
give that little Real Techniques acting
Bruns and will and the black crane
shuttle very lightly open your head big
so you can see 19 oh hi
okay now get that little pencil brush
I'm gonna go in with that frappe color
that we have that we did originally
that's the one that goes out right on
top of the black I want this to be
mostly a cool tone eye and front pays
into such a neutral Brown I really
really wanted that to happen
and that's why I'm using that inside
Coco bear I saw the warmth up here but I
still want to be very cool tone now if
that beaches and cream again underneath
the front pay to give you a really
pretty pretty gradient okay I think we
need to do a weenie I do hold on let me
