were not gonna be doing I just got the
1995 Gerard cosmetics lipstick the one
that it's formulated with Jaclyn you

beautiful job at the formula with
everything it's absolutely stunning and
I'm obsessed with it then we're wearing
it all the time so if you guys were
interested anything from Gerard or
anything like that have a code Manning
anyway it's gonna be it's everything to
me link down there I decided I'm going
to be linking like all my that I
used in the bottom bar below because you

Liz mac prolongwear concealer all over
the lid the brow don't even talk about
