this coppery smokey eye with this dark
nude lip and I think about really really
cool it's super fall appropriate sounds
like that warm orange e coppery tones in
the eyes and the dark nude lid so I
think it's me agreed the combo for fall
so you guys want to see how I got in it
keep watching and if you guys don't like
it don't watch it you know the
drill that you know don't watch it if
you like it cool I'll talk to you guys
all later and I hope you guys have a
great rest of the night or day wherever
you are
bye they don't further video I'll beat
your ass well can you then let's get
this the star tab I really don't wanna
do yet so we're just in no way thing I
already I know want to do something
Capri first first things first Mac Pro
Longwear all over the lid I'm using it
as my primer super awesome primer crease
resistant pixel any redness you know let
drop
awesome crying what's funny is I always
do like one eye on camera and the other
I do off but so you guys are basically
like walking through what I'm doing
first hand they know a lot of other
youtubers they'll have one my already
done it and they do the other one on
camera but I'm opposite I'm like let's
just let's see if we up or not you
guys were doing it with me I mean look
at my eye shadows okay we're gonna go in
with makeup geek beaches and cream what
that do a pony more all over the crease
area we're gonna blend that bad boy into
our crease this is my new favorite
favorite transition color of all time it
used to be like Peach Smoothie from
makeup geek but this one just became my
new my newest favorite because it's a
little bit lighter the future movie is
and has less of a beige undertone to it
than each movie so I really really like
this one
uh-huh it's my favorite and it's matte
as well put that bad boy into our crease
yeah I'll show you to know this is gonna
be an experiment for all of us
now we're gonna go in with Coco bear
another favorite of mine nothing's going
the other corner with a 217 style brush
or someone Peck that in the outer corner
a little bit lower than that beaches
color then not me just color
to Taylor Blaine
what's a good angle for me I'm trying to
find my hand already now there's nothing
 fine just too heavy now we're
gonna go in with Mika bleak mocha I
believe it's called
elos lie that they're going to outer
corner hit the well you see they're so
pigmented I love them
outer corner pad thai bad boy in mostly
just on the other corner though I'm not
gonna take it very far in get that -
it's one boy in M'Lynn and mocha color
out mocha now we're gonna go in with a
Pigman blitz by makeup geek it's just
really pretty oh my god big feeling
really really really really nicely when
you're something I can show you but it
looks like that up man
uh-huh boom I just have to have it in
the lid I'm just in it you go off the
lid because I don't need a lot if I get
fall out I swear to God
he's Dorner oh that's gorgeous
oh my we're packing that onto our lid
with a little flat brush playing right
into our inner corner not going past our
crease just going right up to our crease
with it okay
that is a sick copper smokey I'm gonna
go in with Mango Tango I make it the
essence go into our crease area it's
gonna go a little bit higher than the
cocoa we're a little ahead and
now me going with a 224 and we will
unlock
the eyes twitching it's really
annoyed as you blend you guys will
notice this as you guys blend and blend
and blend when you're using a pigment a
lot of time the pigment will move
because you just keep blending your life
away so don't fret about it just kind of
go in with that same brush and a little
bit more of the pigment
I'm just pack right on top of it it's
really like one dark spot on my eyeball
it's like a spot that's like repelling
pigment what are you doing I don't be
stupid
run check foiling it real quick get that
fix plus on that brush spray it one yeah
there we go
you know ya know get that to some team
blend any edges that might be too harsh
and so for every bottom the lash line
you make it smoky let's do a smoky I'm
going with the Le colors and jumbo
pencil lash line
Oh out of homes though hmm grab a tiny
little brush like I'm finding the brush
goes techniques explain of course one of
my favorites
come on you guys and see how twitchy am
right now it's the word there do move
now I mean Coco bear I'll stop with the
luck again blend it right on top of it
go and win be snail cream
underneath that oh I love peaches and
cream it's mine you pick one me destroy
me lose not one maybe oh it is one my
favorites but I don't know it's my
favorite mega peach shadow it's
definitely up there though for me it is
definitely up there for me now
it just is it's a perfect perfect
transition shade it has no fun let me go
back in with mocha yeah we need just a
little bit more Brown like that I'm
gonna go in I'm not I don't want to do
light now no I'm not gonna do wonderful
I don't feel like it it's not that day
further lightness go in with that axe

blush on I decided that I'm gonna put on
the makeup geek romance blush because
this is a very coppery copper REI and
the cool thing about this blush that I'm
obsessed with first of all is that a
reflex kind of goal to take a peachy
gold color the camera totally not gonna
think that good stuff but we're gonna
put it on cause a mommy it just goes so
so well with this look stop I should
probably not be using a blush that's
like really shiny like this one because
