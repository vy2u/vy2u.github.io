little look this little fall vamp blunt
lid what this like purple smokey eye was
simile you know hold on my lips it's a
whitening lightening lip gloss and it's
popping Iranian like literally like this
 is so pigmented I didn't realize
how good they work I'm also gonna at the
end of the video
show you guys a different lip look with
this eye look I know a lot of people
will be like oh my god it's too much
like it's bold lip old I like no no but
I was going for a fancy look and that's
kind of what I was wanting to do so at
the end of the video I'm gonna show you
guys to do a nude a little nude look
with this just in case you guys a little
freaking out about it so yeah stay tuned
oh out the intima and you guys like
a comment subscribe like do your thing I
love you in the comments so keep doing
that if you guys don't like it don't
 washing you know the drill Hey
bye first things first we're gonna prime
our layup mac prolongwear concealer dab
a little bit on your hand and just don't
handle it they buff lids I love this
concealer but gives you a really
beautiful base for eyeshadow and it
takes away any redness that you might
have on the eyelid so it just gives you
really really pretty clean canvas base
thing you know and it actually has
technology in it to not crease and it
dries waterproof for those shadows
aren't going anywhere if as long as you
want that to be the King actually no
idea what I'm doing it so I'm going to
be patting myself all up to it because
my fan is which I just turn it on would
you guys be able to hear me if it's on
maybe I put it on this lowest setting
okay home at now we're going to go clean
with this to 24 and Peach Smoothie by
makeup geek that's gonna go all of our
crease area we don't have to meet me at
all just put it in your crease go
there's just going to be really great
transition shape for us because it's
very very similar to your own skin tone
color well to my sniffle it I might even
see 2025
there's going to be great when you have
a shadow down first be able to
transition to all other shadows in to
put that every water now we're going to
go in with Coco bear with the 217 style
brush this is the Sigma 180 plenty funny
and we're going to pack that bad boy on
the outer corner of our eye packing
mostly on the outer corner very densely
I'm rubbing it into our lower crease see
that get that 224 blend that all out
what are we gonna do next door I
know okay we go with the chocolate bar
palette this is really pretty maroon
color right there and that's sitting on
the same spot that we've just put the
cocoa bear for make a geek with a
Tuesday balloon we're going to put that
 into that shame yeah pack the
on and blend it
of course next we get the 224 and you
buy machine and what do you win you're
always in my videos me alone
right
you understand when you walk for me now
that I dealt with that disaster now
we're going to go in sugar pill poison
plum with a flat little brush doesn't go
all over our entire lid
oh it's beautiful
I can't off that's one layer let's do
another one now we're gonna go in with
corrupt from makeup geek which is their
black eye shadow that's it one the outer
corner just make it a little bit deeper
just a little bit deeper not a lot
deeper okay
very lightly press that bitch in there
you guys getting darker blend it into
the purple and into that around that
chocolate brown that we had this one I'm
going to go right into our lower crease
area very slow motions nah
now we go with that 224 blend the whole
moon I've decided I'm a lot more warm I
got that blonde one thing in here never
actually go back in with Coco bears I
kind of lost some of the warmth I still
wanted it to be really warm and tough
see that top of the eye I think looks
pretty good go back in with some more
just use the brush
roxeanne add any more product to it just
whatever we have left on the brush and
we're going to pack on top of the center
any way that we might have lost any I
don't want to add more color I just want
to just send a blend the whole thing
bottom lash line that we can do anything
cool yeah mm-hmm we're gonna smoke it
out on the bottom lash line we're gonna
grab any black jumbo pencil or honestly
can use any like gel liner
anything doesn't really matter
I'm gonna use the Le colors my pencil
and back ain't black and we're gonna run
down the bottom of our lash line
oh my god I'm not really that good at
this I'm not how good because like I
wasn't like trained as a truck as a
child girl growing up like this I'm
gonna do in the water line I'm over here
like barely a year and a half in and I'm
like like that
I did it okay now we're going to go a
little bit lower like before eyelashes
are open your eye bag you don't need to
be very neat honestly you don't grab a
tiny s little brush this one is the Real
Techniques accent brush and just blend
the little the black gel liner
everywhere it doesn't look that good yet
don't judge me yet Britain gram
tiny little pencil brush and that cocoa
bear eyeshadow if I make a geek I'm not
going to run that on top of the black
thing again we're going with that Peach
Smoothie below the cocoa bear we're
going to want to add a transition when
doing a smoky eye the the trick of it is
to have a fade like a faded transition
from dark to light black pencil on the
lash line but brown underneath it and
there we go with it you and softer beige
you Brown underneath that cool that's
one give it that smokey that it's like
smoke like like smoke okay feed I'm
actually gonna go in with sketch by Mac
has a little bit of purple to it and I
just want a little bit more purple
between the light purple and the black
I'm that sketch to really help with that
transition
Oh dial should I do
line it will do a little mean I'm not
gonna get crazy and do a baby black gel
liner or just black eye or whatever
I'm going to the other eye and now we'll
be right back
all right cool so we got both eyes done
they're pretty symmetrical I mean
there's much less I'm gonna get right
now not gonna fret they're pretty good
cool
so last chance the time call your lashes
peeps curl them I'll pitch a lot of
shiny from the curlers I mean my
shiny what the go to mascara
benefit they're real that you know throw
my highlight right now is everything I'm
just not a good mascara put it on myself
on clients I can do mascara like boom
boom boom
done oh so easy by myself I'm like Neil
don't up Beach we're gonna use
level of lashes lashes my favorite item
in the style Bambi they were in my
favorites video I posted a little while
back so if you don't know what I'm
talking about
go watching it go right now I've been
watching too much Miranda sings like I
thought as it happen like she's starting
to rub off on me do some duel on named
flume
this is my right okay so my right height
almost gone right so basically my camera
died so now we're going to do lips and
why excited do I want to do a dark lip
because it's gonna be a very vampy fall
look
I grabbed the NYX lip liner in the plum
line your whole lips however you like to
do it
now I'm going with Gerard cosmetics lip
gloss in seduction that's the one with a
little light in the mirror that is so
 cute
I love it so first I'm applying a lip
