brows so I know this video is going to
be basically about how I do my brows and
how I do the tapering the lightening the
shaping as you can see right here as you
can tell like really tell but my brows
aren't really even my right brow on this
side is really dense and thick on the
outer corner but my left one is not I
really focus on giving the brow getting
that brow to be the best Braille that
that brow can be instead of having to
try to make it as symmetrical as
possible I mean I do try to get as
symmetrical as possible
but I'm not gonna like like fret about
it so much I rather the one brow look
amazing and the other brow look amazing
by itself this brow look amazing Rodgers
with me sisters not twins so that's just
what I live off of so I just want to see
how I got my brows to be pretty and
really sharp and really like
cholita then keep watching and yeah I
hope you guys like it subscribe and
share that shape like everything I'll
see you guys donate I'll keep watching
can my little babies what we're gonna do
first and go in with a really dark
shadow that like matches your hair color
maybe like a shade lighter than your
color mine for example I have black hair
so I need fun with really deep dark
brown color I'm gonna go in with embark
by Mac and then I'm going in with a
little like flat top brush I got at
Michael's 23 bucks if you can get a
brush that's like cheapest and not
have to spend like $30 on a brush I say
go for it and this one really it's
really good to be going with the dark
brown I'm just gonna pack that on
and a start and then underneath the
front part of my brow just kind of
combing through
on the bottom first I'm just gonna let
you feather that through the entire hair
area anywhere that I have like
sparseness I'm gonna fill in with the
shadow but I'll make frowny faces I'm a
foreigner when I do deeper eyebrow lifts
I always found I don't know why keep
filling it in
and you don't have to be me honestly
right now like with me I'm not neat when
I'm doing this because I'm going to
carve out my brow anyway so just be
messy bitch now I'm going to watch words
the top I'm gonna lightly fill the top
very lightly
so want to be on the more natural side I
mean as natural as a carpet a grout can
be obviously get back up in a natural
but I still wanted to be decent natural
light strokes and light pressure
basically I have filled in my sparseness
quote we have the bass part done sort
out the bass cave now what we're gonna
do is we're gonna go in with uh Nastasia
 the good I'm going with dark
brown and then we go in with a super
super super tiny precise brush like it's
probably I think it's a nail brush but I
use it for my I look for like if I'm
doing detailed work something like a
pack of navel brushes is perfection when
they're like so so cheap I mean not get
me wrong used like the good stuff to is
running is mac brushes use my precious
but if I can get something cheap I'm
going to do that because I'm a poor I've
made a tiny a bunch a machine and
autonomy so I'm gonna go in dark brown
I'm gonna carve out the bottom of my
brow first we're gonna go underneath
where your hair is if you have brows
that have a perfectly clean line you
don't have to do this you're just
blessed but if you're like me and don't
then this is what you want to do you're
going with this dark brown color really
catch foul underneath this part wanna
say you do not have to be me at all I've
never made with this I've never
neat because I double meet Kobe
I'm just feather it out and you guys see
what I'm know so now what you can see is
that there's this line that I'm
basically faking or my hair ends but
obviously I'm going past it and I'm just
cheating it just cheating my hairline on
my brow to make it look like I have this
really straight perfect line when I
don't we're gonna go and conceal after
anyway so they really you're okay right
now now because we did the bottom
working bow on the top and what I like
to do personally I like to just do the
top end of my brow just make a sharp I
don't like to do like sharpness all the
way on the top just as I just it's just
not the look I like to do so if you like
to do that do you do you I'll do
mean do you so goes on top and I'm gonna
go in on where I want my arch to be
using your eye shape to where you want
your brow the front of my tear duct is
is usually where I want my brow to start
looking forward the end of my iris is
where my arch and the end of my eye is
where I want my brow to end
ok we're going to go in so I'm just go
up the nation' in whenever I have that
on my brush I'm just going to feather it
towards the front see there I went too
high it's all good honestly I'm going to
go in with concealer or foundation
afterward we just want a good base cause
we have our brow like basically filled
like the filling that part is completely
done now I'm going to go in with a super
super tiny brush this one is from ELF
it's like a dollar it's so good and then
for the top this is what I'm gonna do my
little secret I'll go in with the
concealer that's lighter than my skin
tone on the bottom and then on the top
what I'll carve out with is the
foundation that used for my whole entire
face so that's gonna be a lot easier for
it to blend in to my face cause that
really works for me
so I'm gonna go in with the studio fix
foundation it's nap time
I'm going to go in with Studio Fix
concealer and NC and NW 25 and that's
for that a lot of them and this part is
like the more intense part this is the
part where I like really like pay
attention like gnarly I just like to
start at the front I just do and I'll
rest my hand on my face
as you can see it's re starting get
cleaned up in here mm-hmm
I told you it looked better already when
you're actually on your brow you really
want to go in with a full coverage
concealer you don't want any of that
darker color to show towards the end I
like to go with really light strokes so
I'm pretty good I'll blend the rest I
concealer down I'm just kind of went out
with my finger that's the base form at
the bottom on my back the top is not
what I want right now so I'm going to
change that up with some foundation
after I text my holes I've got some text
from my holes now I'm go in my
foundation I'm using today same brush
that same little concealer brush that we
used and then I'm going to go on the top
and edge up from the top I like to be on
top if you know what I mean I'm just
eating
the same you adjust it on the bottom
I've gotten a lot better I dig my brows
do to my friends sometimes eyebrows will
be hey sometimes they want so I'm just
kind of working with what I got for now
so for now this'll do and this is how
they do my brow what do you think for
the most part I'll enjoy my bro
hey arch tapered at the end really full
I'm doing everything or every time I do
look I mean yeah so this what I got it's
what it's not I'm working with so you
know just have fun guys how good they hi
oh oh lord give me the strength because
it is too hot in here I'm gonna get sick
I might get sick it's so high huh high
