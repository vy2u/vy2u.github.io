without further ado let's get this
 bitch started and yeah if you
guys want to see how I did it stay
watching and enjoy the insults
alright clean face let's get this bitch
started man I'm so inspired by Kathleen
to do like things that aren't like super
expensive in this video so I'm gonna be
using a lot of things that are like much
more on the like cost-effective side of
things okay foundation wise we're gonna
use Mac sup that cheap uh-huh
we're gonna use that mac sculpt
foundation oh it's not the foundation I
use all the time or intenta and I
actually have a little sample of it from
work cuz I wanted to try it I'm
good a lot of people talk about it I
look so like I got chickenpox
Pat that bitch over there and I don't
you guys notice these I went a little
ham with the snapchats I'm a little cray
cray
you guys and see that I just I think
they're really cute we're gonna buff in
this foundation with a sigma f80 flat
top kabuki and i'm using the color NC 20
so happy got an external hard drive
because that means I can do my full
foundation routine
and like everything else you know I look
so pale fun okay but I swear like this
is my color like like a light I
am it's ridiculous then I'm gonna go in
with the LA girl Pro conceal HD
concealer and that shade natural and
this concealer is like cheap as
hell is like 30 bucks
I just got it when I was in LA this past
weekend so I'm like methyl try it out
Patrick swears by this so I'm gonna use
it if you tuck the bowel today let me
get a brush I'm just going to blend out
my concealer with then war Fiji - this
concealers a little bit pinky for me but
I think that's a good thing for me
because I have like more dark circles
she'll get you okay for me you know it
really does give you a lot of
convergence concealer it's very very
very liquidy though like much more
liquidy than I'm used to but I like it
so far
give me that coverage looking pretty huh
this bitching I love this but you have
to say this bitch you're gonna share
you're gonna be a cracked-out
miss you're not on the crack kind of way
I'm talking the concealer pennilyn try
keep this channel PC I'm just kidding
I'm gonna cover the whole thing with the
Mac Studio Fix I mean you guys know I do
not see 25 you guys know and a morphine
MV 3 which is like their big fluffy
black brush I wish my let me pack it on
nothing too heavy take it down the neck
a little bit
and then this is I'm so excited the
morphine contour palette you guys I can
so I'm gonna go in I'm going to use this
color I'm just going to press that
underneath my eye to highlight like look
up even to that is
and this palette is so so so so much
cheaper than the other sauce zero one
and you guys know if I'm using another
palette that's not Anasazi one like
there's like or something going on I
love that other songs he wants to of
course I took my ultimate but this is
such a good palette because it's so
cost-efficient so then I'm going to go
in with this middle one and the mb5
which Jaclyn uses all the time by
morphine you guys might be wondering why
I have so many more free stuff it's cuz
I visited in LA the morphe store and I'm
just going in and bronzing we have the
owner of morphine she invited me over to
go see the store her name's Linda she's
absolutely amazing Linda if you're
watching this what's up homie she's
absolutely amazing I love her to death
she was so kind to me
look at this bronzer like are you
 kidding you still pigment and
running on the temples as well
mm-hmm I know mmm in this palette oh my
god it's like so so freakin
cost-efficient you guys are gonna die
and I tell you how much I know they're
going by then I go in with this one the
grayish brown with the NARS the NARS EDA
and this one is the car to carve out a
 cheek I look up a Winton
we're just going and carving like that
I'm still not really good at using this
brush yet I'm trying but it's
hard I don't know maybe I'm just like
not I'm not gonna using this brush yet
I'll learn learn like look at
that contour are you joking tell me
that's not bomb though for the
frame that is so good like look at that
 contour and highlight I know
let's go in highlight I'm going to use
the Mac pigment in life one of their
holiday pigments and if you guys have
the chance to get it I would I swear
this color it makes me fake hair
load using an m4 38 brush by morphe as
well
and
girl's cheekbones bitch look at
them
 Maleficent right now watch what
cheekbones like Chrissy I don't know if
I went a little crazy with the font for
though it's fine I'm a bully I need to
cut my cheeks in why don't I have her
I'm gonna do the blush and after
because I don't know what kind of color
blush want to do with the item dull so
I'm gonna finish the brows and I'm gonna
pry my eyelids off camera and I'll be
right back
and now that we got our brows and we got
our eyelid primer run you know we're
gonna go in with beaches and queen by
makeup geek which is my favorite
transition shade of all time you guys I
mean this is nothing new but knowing you
this olive oil game Tony okay we're just
going right into the crease with this
guy with a sigma e40 tapered blending
probably my favorite blending brush of
all time ain't way now I had no idea
that Sigma offered a 10% discount every
single month on the products so I'll go
ahead link that sub down there - I know
I do if any this well um yeah I'll
go ahead and link the Sigma discount for
10% off and the link to the brushes down
below as well just get together in just
that I mean why don't I huh then let it
go in because I'm thinking I'm gonna do
with a cranberry smokey eye because you
know what line is lying
it's Thanksgiving uh we're
gonna go in with bitten by negatvie oh
you guys you know the drill oh yeah and
that's gonna go on a morphe m4 33 we're
going and this just reminds me of a 217
for Mac and that's gonna go into our
crease bitten but mostly art out or like
our outer corner though not so I like
this brush what the pretty sure
this pressures only like 5 bucks - damn
that bitch put down some product though
I'm gonna go back home with a 40 blend I
hope that bitch in in to the beaches and
Koreans we already have laid down first
that's why it's myself a transition
color laid down first let the other
colors blend into something so much
easier some cheesy I shall put it down
like that she put it down hard like
 Nicki Minaj like putting it down
on awful okay then I'm gonna go in with
the LA Colors jumbo pencil in black just
a black jumbo pencil use whatever one
you have or a gel liner it doesn't
matter this doesn't go all of our into
our eyelid like that so you leave it
nice and dark going on now I'm
gonna use my finger just kind of buff it
out a little bit or just kind of blend
it out a little bit more right up to the
bit in color the black it's just our
base for another eye shadow but because
I want it to be smoky that's all we have
the black down first because I wanted to
be a smoky eye cuz I mean we're going up
for a bold Thanksgiving I make this
should bold this mug and now I'll just
go back in with that like the morpheme
4:33 and they're just gonna go over it
no additional product just kind of blend
that black and with bitten a little bit
