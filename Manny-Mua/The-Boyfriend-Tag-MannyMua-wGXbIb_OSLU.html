today's video is gonna be one of my most
requested videos of all time it is
concerning my boyfriend yes I know

said our love is too strong and you know
he's just the one he is he really aunts
he's the one better like he's really no
one you know I just he's so masculine so
strongly so tall just this big the
biggest beef cake of my life and I got
so lucky to be with him and he just
swept me off my feet literally that
bitch picked me up when I met him and I
was fine I think that me I need to
introduce you
Hey so this is him come on boo yo what's
up YouTube mmm hey guys so we are back
to answer the questions so I just have
an intro I thought I would be fun to
include Patrick and my boyfriend tag
he's not actually my boyfriend we're not
boyfriends were the best friends and I
thought I'd be fun to include a minute
because we've never read the questions
so I think you should be fun to try
absolutely we're sorry if we crushed any
dreams but unfortunately the question
mr. Brent :
Oh gain so where did we meet we met Fame
Expo 2014 right how's first time I met
you
I was walking with my friend and I saw
Patrick with his friends and I saw him
in across the street and I was like oh
my god Patrick and I talked to him
before on Instagram and on like social
media and I literally like yelled so
loud it was like
he I am I had followed him he was like
oh my god am I could see you there blah
blah blah and I was like no I had like
seriously had like seven or eight K my
famous public eye - what yeah he had no
idea who I was running at that and so I
had screamed his name I ride some I said
give a big hug didn't have his turban on
oh nothing down recognising you like
magic and then I think like at the end
of Fame like we didn't really like
hanging out and then like we were just
about to leave and then all of a sudden
meaning like swings his camera from
behind me like hey oh this is the
picture of where we first met our first
meeting uh what was our first date first
date that was technically I was I first
day that was a turkey deer first oh no
about how we have a mutual friend Jamie
yeah Thank You Jen Jenny so man was was
around the area and he was like oh what
are you guys doing and I just invited
him over to my roommates place in
Hollywood so then he ended up coming
over and then we went to dinner at this
diner
and I was like at first like I guess
group thing yeah it was running a Jenny
Ronny room and Jenny was our mutual
friend so it was like me Jimmy Ronnie
and Minnie and then you know at this
point I'm still like okay cute so
anyways I have massive weight on it he's
right there so this is what I was
wearing I was wearing this kind of like
old times old memories yes our first
actual like hanging out yeah so I wore
this like overcoat layin have this bails
thickening way and we had a photo shoot
apps she was like oh I want to do like
my outfit of the day jus lookin real
cute you so let me do some pictures like
like next thing you know my shirt is
blowing up and his was my first
time knee like actually hanging out with
him and Here I am trying to be like oh
my god I'm gonna do an outfit of the day
for Instagram and he's laughing at me
because everything is spamming like the
lighting bookbag welcome he is really
tall
I had my heels on so we need I mean
we're adding yeah he met me dead and
then he was like oh you're really short
so this time I had a wig and no heels so
that's extra short like a class and he
was like oh my god it like you look a
lot give me a favor bring the camera
higher this bitch I have
I was like oh my god Latino tree-trunk
[Laughter]
uestion I'm required did you know that I
was the one that's funny I asked him
earlier right
earlier today weird I was talking to him
and I was like it's cool like it's
amazing how like a best friend like
Patrick because it's like he really
understands like the things that I go
through and I understand a lot of things
that he goes through and it's like it's
great together I can fight each other
and Singapore boy doing the beauty thing
and it's just a works like we're a great
friend and it just really works
oh yeah that's gonna use like just like
how'd you know like how did you know
right away that week this is literally
today like lyrics like he's hot you
don't want him to be like close friends
and I was like honestly like I just feel
like we were gonna be close because I
just felt like that vibe from you you
know and I took him a while to get
around like to come around and be like
man and I'm very open with like
everything I'm an Aries like I'm very
much like another out there like going
crazy but he's not so I told him right
away that I knew and I were gonna be
best friends in the house and ginger
arts house first impression like damn is
sure yeah like I'm for me I always I'm
saying like wow another boy so yeah the
thing with me though is because I had
followed Patrick when I was in still
doing my normal Instagram like my manual
73 Instagram where it was like about
like my life not the beauty one so I
already know who Patrick was and I was
already like influenced by him a lot in
my old Instagram you can see a little
things where it's like oh like it's
fired at Patrick start to do this look I
thought it was line but then we were
facetiming one time and he was 200 weeks
ago like gets pregnant Patrick Starr
like no brows no line they're just like
a shadow mm-hmm and I was like see ya I
told her that I had looked up to you
that was back then and so um my
impression was like he's so brave like
he's so great Juiz does and I think it's
really great to be able to he was one of
the first influencers for me like for
guys
yes sir who said I love you first and
where were we I probably said I'll be
first if I probably I mean I
won't release it I'll have to love you I
love you you're so amazing like this
it's so funny it's because like he lives
all the way to San Diego and I live all
the way in Orlando and we were like
FaceTime often men oh I love you so cool
I love you I love you I love you I do it
I L
Astrid like a star star star you you
yeah and then you would be like um cause
I've read this together Patrick we got
that same going down and factor so
you're like what do you argue about the
most we argue when we are are on a stone
he's not me today I don't really hurt
myself when it comes to like my social
movie ending the things I do and I work
really hard now just like not stop until
something's done and I like it the way I
like it and see what Patrick and I'll
have like a self pity party about
something and you know telling me is
that you need to stop like you're doing
great it uh and the same thing with him
like that's why the only thing we ever
really hard about yeah yeah exactly
because Patrick actually gets it we're
just going to random questions what
happened to all what when I eat every
day if I could
well after this for both of us Mandy
went on the phone or on FaceTime it's
always diet coke you want to kiss ass to
Mandy when you see him in person I think
yours would be either white rice in love
yes yes he loves it so can you
that's my eye color brown as what
am i : um don't look at my listen he's
all yeah yes those have what about that
backpack who wears the pants in the
relationship I'll probably say Patrick
wears the pants in the relationship
because you're just a lot more poised
and he's older than me so I comes in for
a lot of advice he's only the one I go
to for my advice and things like that so
bitch he was like I need it for a lot of
things like what if something that I do
that you don't like give it
I hate that you snoring what
this whole time I told him I told him
that I was like this and I snore I'm
trying to be real cute it was like 4:00
in the morning I'm trying to edit and do
like much try to do my YouTube
thing and this bitch is like Thomas kubs
right here it was a bit yeah that's okay
that's a doctor I was editing it so
here's office a help with you told me I
couldn't talk didn't nothing I'm for
sure so he was talking to me and he was
talking in literally eight seconds later
the bitch was out and snoring and I look
at him I'm like you're lying I
mean he's not now not out hard and
here's an eye twitch I'm like man I'm
like it's like the bed is huge so it's
not like we like we're touching her in a
way at night felt that shaking did you
kick me in the face
I'm just kidding I wish
what what I mean I don't like that you
do men always use the word hot and it's
always hear it from that scary thing
I've always said this because I'm from
the East Coast so he always says like
that's crazy harm people stay bad it was
a cow lots of talent people stay hot
it's like air in Canada but if a cow
