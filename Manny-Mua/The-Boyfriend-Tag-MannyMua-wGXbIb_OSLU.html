every Tina's video did the question of
required did you know that I was the one
that's funny I asses earlier right
earlier today weird I was talking to him
and I was like it's cool like it's
amazing how like a best friend like
patchy because it's like he really
understands like the things that I go
through and I understand a lot of things
that he goes through and it's like it's
great because I can find each other and
Singapore boys doing the beauty thing
and it's just a works like we're a great
friend and it just really works told me
yet asking to use like just like how'd
you know like how did you know right
away that we're this is literally -
they're like lyrics like he's had you
know - be like close friends and I was
like honestly like I just feel like we
were gonna be close because I just felt
like that vibe from you you know and I
took him a while to get around like to
come around and be like man and I'm very
open with like everything I'm an Aries
like I'm very much like an eye mask loud
they're like going crazy but he's not so
I told him right away that you and I
were gonna be best friends in look at
how
at gender arts house first impression
I like damn is Mitch's sure I just came
for this convention I'm free smells like
cuz I ever had on mystical I was like
yeah like I'm for me I always say like
wow another boy so yeah who in the void
so the thing with me though is because I
had followed Patrick when I was in still
doing my normal Instagram like my manual
73 Instagram where I was like about like
my life not the beauty one so I'd
already known Patrick was and I was
already like influenced by him a lot in
my old Instagram you can see like little
things where it's like oh like inspired
at Patrick started do this look I
thought it was lying but then we were
facetiming one time and he and he what
200 weeks ago like it's private Patrick
Starr like no brows no line they're just
like a shadow mm-hmm and I was like see
I told you out that I had looked up to
Mel's back then and so um my impression
was like he's so brave like he's so
brave to do what he does and I think is
really great to be able to he was one of
the first influencers for me like for
guys I love you yes nice person who said
I love you first and where were we I
probably said I'll be first if I
probably I mean I overly said
I've had you love I love you you're so
amazing like the bit this it's so funny
it's because like GE lives all the way
in San Diego and I live while waiting on
Lando and we were like FaceTime often
men cubed I love you so cool I love you
I love you I love you I love you I was
like I like I do our check I feel like I
L
Astrid at little star star star you you
yeah I like he's like yeah you love me
too yeah and then he would be like um
toes I read this together Patrick we got
that same going down and better so
you're like I just mentioned
what do you argue about the most we
argue when we are are on a stone
exactly I'm really hard myself when it
comes to like my social media and the
things I do and I work really hard now
just like not stop until something's
done and I like it the way I like it and
same apatriquen so I'll have like a self
pity party about something and all
telling me is that you need to stop like
you're doing great at it and the same
thing with him like that's why the only
thing we ever really hard you both yeah
and I'll probably Fran that I'm yeah
exactly because project actually gets it
we're just going to random clashes what
happens you all because it's gonna be
really lovely and I'm really not
thinking on me our bomb what when I eat
every day if I could will answer this
for both of us
Manny went on the phone or on FaceTime
it's always dive come on kids ask too
many when you see him in person bring my
dad but I think yours would be either
white rice Olivia yes I love my Filipino
food he loves you talking to move you -
it wets my eye color
bro that's hahaha
it isn't like my dad yeah what am i
cackling um don't look at my listen he's
oh yeah yesterday's --all nice to have
those have one savvy live last year when
I had out that pack wears the pants in
the relationship I'll probably say
Patrick wears the pants in the
relationship because he's just a lot
more poised and he's older than me so
it's like a worse since I ever saw that
I comes in for a lot of advice he's only
the one I go to for my advice and things
like that so bitch
he was I needed for a lot of things like
emails but what is something that I do
that you don't like give it to me
I hear that you snore what
byxis doors looking look I told time I
told him I told him that I was like this
and I snore I was trying to be real cute
it was at 4:00 in the morning I'm trying
to edit and do like much try to do
my YouTube thing and this bitch is like
toddy stuck right here
there was a girl yeah so careless but I
went this side doctor that's all right
like I was editing and so he was also
help with you totally like a doing talk
didn't nothing a for sure so you're
talking to me and you're talking in
literally eight seconds later the bitch
was out and snoring and I look at him
I'm like you're lying he's not a
rock out hard and here's an eye twitch
- I'm like then I'm like it's like the
bed is huge so it's not like we like her
touching her hand like at night felt
that shaking I'll shake it also I
believe did you kick me in the face
I'm just kidding I wish um
what sweat what is something I don't
like that you do me though men always
use the word hot and it's all I always
hear it from that I love it scary thing
I've always said this cuz I'm from the
East Coast so he always says like that's
crazy huh it's a lot of people say that
it was a cow
lots of Cali people say ha it's like air
and Canada but if a cow a pig visiting
Hall time right huh oh it's not just a
bomb huh like what yeah these letters

like a confirmation thing and also
