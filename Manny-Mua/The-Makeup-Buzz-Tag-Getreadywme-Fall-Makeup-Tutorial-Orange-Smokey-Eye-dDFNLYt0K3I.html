think that should be well-known more on
YouTube sorry I have no makeup on right

it's the Sarah McNamara miracle skin
transforming faith looks like this you

a good primer I worked at Sephora I
worked at I work at Mac this has been
the best one I promise you trying it I'm
just gonna put this everywhere I
have pimples totally put that everywhere
like your finger I love this primer it's
basically just like up what is yeah five
in one tinted skin enhancer with UVA UVB
protection
let's ball Tony
okay next how'd you get over there let's
see some cult favorites let's do some
cult favorites we're going to do NARS
sheer glow in Fiji and a sigma f80 flat
top kabuki wow I can't say that one
little pump on the back of my hand I'm
just gonna toss that bitch on mmm and I
avoid the under-eye Eric someone who can
see there anyway why waste found a shame
when I have concealer why I pet it and I
love this brush it's so worth it's so
worth that height it is so worth
it
and just literally like if you like an
airbrushed flawless
Wow
love love love this foundation I've been
using it for a while hey I know now
we're going to do concealer we're going
to be using the NARS radiant creamy
concealer in the color honey is a little
bit of pink in it
I'm do the under eye area Oh bitch this
isn't loud my cut out so I don't
use man this is not my color
doing what it's fine because I have a
solution to that we're gonna mix it with
nw20 prolong consider my Mac another
cult favorite toss that bitch on mm-hmm
this is gonna fix anything then I'm
going to use a brush that not many
people talk about but I'm literally in
love with it but this is the more Fiji -
so cute it isn't something Oh patient
that your brush you're kidding I
love this brush for concealer or
anything like that signal and that
everyone is like obsessed with buffed
out to perfection mmm now let's say
everything let's sit that we're
going to use a brush that I don't hear
anything about which you guys should be
using kailani antennas really pretty
it's the luck see Beauty 502 large
powder brush it's just pink handle and
used it before and I just think it's
really cute and girly and I think that's
why I like it so much everything I'm
going to be using is going to be linked
in the bottom bar some things have codes
something don't these have codes and
we're going with Studio Fix powder
foundation by Mac another cult favorite
on your tooth just set everything I'd
like to be too glowy
let's be real of an oily mess of this
brush because it's I'm synthetic so it's
cruelty free and it's just the right
amount of fluffiness but it's still just
like the right amount of denseness sit
with my lip still egg wash down like
we're now we're gonna use another cult
favorite uh Nastasia contour palette
we're gonna use the banana color in this
night with my Real Techniques setting
brush now for bronzer I'm going to use
that same luck see beauty brush and I'm
going to go on with the favorite of mind
that not is not really talking about too
much but I'm obsessed with it this is
the dark care blend powder I've hit pan
so you're not
really do like this and this is
gonna be for our bronzer which they put
on here
I just gives you a really nice just like
warm glow to the skin because it's not
too too too matte I just love that like
warmth it gives me though I think it
looks so beautiful
especially when I'm at work and people
are like down for what do you have
contoured with and I'm like it's the
care blend ooh see you look it's coming
along okay now okay this brush I'm so
excited to even talk about this brush
because I'm it's like basically revamped
my entire contouring life it's honestly
this is a sick aspect okay so it's the
morphe g3 looks like this ready for it
it's a little like sideways buffing
brush are you kidding okay go back in
I'm gonna go in with a cool tone right
here it's just so like compacted per but
just let it let them talk do the talkin
let me do it
buffed to perfection I don't even need
another buffing brush like that this
help honest brushes right now cheekbones
to kill that's what this little bitch
will give you it'll give you cheekbones
to kill cutting diamonds with these
bitches we're going with warm soul by
Mac another cult favorite drinking that
kool-aid and then we go in with a
global glow by Mac as well just give me
a little bit of warm now the global glow
which I'm also grab on a mmm I love this
brush as well I like to go hand with a
highlighter Allen gibbeh
those pimples are still with me
how how my face is done glowy
gorgeous okay yeah let's do the eyes now
this is a fun tag I'm really liking it
oh but actually I'm gonna do the brows
off camera because then they'll take
for-fucking-ever
but I'm also going more of the buzzing
products tag I'm going to go in with the
gerard cosmetics brow bar to go which
looks like this and we go on with on
associate dip brow in Ebony I can't find
I can't find her in here but that's
we're going in with give me a quick
second and I'll put that on hold
I'm thinking that I want to do a really
brown warm smoky eye if you first
written go in we're gonna prime our
eyelids with Mac painterly paint-pot
um you just need to be really light
headed with the painterly paint-pot
because you use too much it will settle
in the fine lines he'll try to be very
very light handed with it and it'll give
you really nice base I really like
actually the shadows I decide to do one
like the buzz this buzz tag are the
makeup geek shadows which was really
hard for me because I use them all the
 time and we're going to use
Sigma brushes I mean nah so first we're
going to go in with a sigma e40 and
makeup geeks beaches and cream which I
mean shouldn't come to a shocker to you
guys because I wear that all the time I
want to put that in our crease with that
Sigma e-40 blend it everywhere don't
need to be neat they're just gonna be
our transition color I'm also just going
to quickly highlight real quick I'm
going to use vanilla bean as I dunno
bean what the vanilla bean oh my
god I'm so good at though I'm just a
flat brush is a luck see Beauty one and
I'm just going to apply that on the brow
bone just to really seamlessly blend
everything on whether to look like
there's any like hard transition so yeah
iam will boogie hmm
I cannot wait to make a freakin um
favorites video I think I make one in an
October like the end of October because
I I got this brush you guys it has
revamp my whole life I mean I
need to see more of it on YouTube like I
have to like I just have to it's the
Sigma
ether t8 which is basically smaller
denser version of the d40 e38 v40 stop
we're going to pick up chickadee by make
a peak it's this very orangey yellow
right here when I put that in our cream
very lightly put that in there I like to
keep my eyes open for this so I can see
exactly where I'm applying the shadows
so that when my eyes are open you can
actually see them it's a problem with me
is I have hooded lids so I really need
to kind of cooperate they need to
cooperate with me and I need to figure
out I want to put that shadow we're
gonna go in now with makeup geek Mango
Tango which is this orange e dome that's
gonna go a little bit lower
that's scene III a brush
and then just blend it outwards so you
get that orange e tone oh sorry
now we're gonna go in with Coco bear
which is this really warm brown with a
lot of red undertone in it which is
gonna be great for old brown smokey eye
anything that's in got an outer corner
look at our glow Oh bitch a tiger only
lower than we have the Mingo tangu
it's kind of blend it outwards now I
want to go back in with the e-40 brush
which is the FET what are they we're
going with E for T and buff out that
cocoa bear
it's coming along it's coming along is
coming along now I'm going to go in with
a black jumbo pencil company's LA Colors
1 and put that by our lower lashline use
my finger to buff the the eye to buff
downwards towards my lashes because I'm
just kind of picking up whatever I have
left on my finger and putting that
upwards now this is the fun part we're
going to grab our Sigma e30 2 which is
just like basically this little flat
buffing brush thing and sugarpill butter
cupcake it's a bit of cooking bench
no it's flame point and going with the
orange one and now we're going to pack
right on top of the black on the inner
part of our eye right up to the cocoa
bear color so I go halfway in patting
and then we're going to go in with
makeup geek mocha just this dark dark
dark brown and that's going to go right
on top the black on the outer corner
like this
and then just blend the colors together
inner corner I'm using clothes like this
that are so so strong just go back in
the butter cupcake so don't lose I mean
the pigmentation okay now that we have
the top of the eye part done I think
looks pretty cool and smoky and smoke
down yeah we're going to do the same
steps that we did on the top on the
bottom we're going to go in with Peach
Smoothie on a makeup geek pointed crease
brush on the bottom this is an act as
our transition color like we do with the
top and actually want a lot more orange
in this part I'm going to go right in
with a sugar pill plane point again

that everywhere okay I went a
little crazy with the orange hold gonna
buff it out make a geek tote bear on the
outer corner only now for a fun little
pop color I mean might as well we're
gonna grab make it be a cosmopolitan

going to pop that on inner corner for a
little bit of shimmer and golden
shimmery

shadow part is done it's pretty
symmetrical a cement rose I'm gonna get
