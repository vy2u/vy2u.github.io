but if you guys do like this video and
you guys do let me please like this
video and subscribe to my channel if you
want already and if you're new what's up
I'm an emu a and this is my palette
okay first things first this is that
palette this is her right here this is
what she looks like
can I see the hologram holographic miss
- it is a matte black and this is the
back it is a crescent moon of a photo of
me in the moon so dorky look a little
bit it's just so so me the night sky the
falling stars the moon it's just it's me
you know I am such a night owl like I'm
created by my I'm filming it's at 9:20
at night I'm just that's just how I am
and I've always been like that and so
this is kind of like an ode to you guys
who are night owls as well our feel more
creative during the nighttime feel like
you're waterbenders at night so a little
bit of back stuff about the palette
first before I go into the colors and
the swatches the palette will retail for
$45 45 US dollars I believe price of
this palette a lot of people are asking
you about it and a lot of people have
like complained about it a little bit
which I understand I totally understand
I'm not trying to like bash you for
complaining no not at all the reason
that the palette is $45 is because
that's as low as we can go to still be
able to make a profit for the company
like I'm not even kidding
so make a geek shadows normally are six
dollars a pan right there six dollars
and the foil shadows are ten this
palette is nine colors and it's $45 so
that makes it five dollars a pan and two
of them are foiled so you are
technically saving a good amount of
money when you are buying it in the
palette the thing too is that makeup
geek manufacturers in the United States
so their stuff is made in the US so I
mean in China it doesn't have like extra
filler and it doesn't have talc in it it
doesn't have all these extra things that
a lot of other companies do have it
which makes it a lot cheaper to make
because they are making in China for a
lot less money and they do have filler
in it not as high ingredient but maybe
doesn't and so you have to remember that
the formulas that make it because are
more expensive because they are made in
the US and they are paraben free so just
remember that I know it kind of sucks
because the price is just higher but
when you're wanting good quality stuff
that's kind of what you have to do you
get to forfeit the price you know you
want good quality stuff but you don't
wanna pay the price I know it just it's
just it's hard it's it's tough it's
frustrating and I know if you don't have
the put money I'm so sorry we couldn't
make it any lower and forty five is the
lowest we could do and I'm so sorry
that's still too high but that's just
like what is realistic I suppose yeah
that's why the price is what it is
sorry guys and it said on makeup geek
site there's no other site that's in
carrying it I believe it's like not in
Sephora ultra anything like that it's
gonna be on nikidik site so there's nine
shadows inside this palette five of them
are custom created by me selected by me
and just everything by me but there's
four that are part of the geeks
collection already four shades one is a
pigment that had pressed but still
there's four shades that's already part
of making Peaks lines which one let you
guys know that right now it's not all
custom shadows I wish it was but they
just couldn't them when they approached
me about the palette it was going to be
a favorite and custom palette so five
customs and four favorites so kids
people are wondering like why don't you
all do custom ones that wasn't really an
option for us to be able to do so that
is why it's custom and it's favorites
I'm forgetting anything else just ask me
in the comments bar because I will be
going through my comments all day when
this goes up so don't you worry about it
but I'm just gonna go ahead and start
getting into the actual palette down
okay so once you open the bad boy oh
this is what she looks like
black packaging embossed right here just
it just feels so good it feels so
 gun and it's what the back of
the palette looks like it has a bunch of
crescent moons the names of the shadows
and Manny anyway at the top this is what
the palette looks like oh so good
there's a mirror attached to it thank
goodness we needed a mirror you know
that like we need a mirror we need a
mirror so we have a mirror attached to
the palette as well so I'm just go one
by one to talk about every shade of the
pallet okay great so first row first
shade let's go and get into this the
first one is called Artemis it is a
custom shade is one I created with
makeup geek and it is a white gold with
like a champagne reflection to it it is
stunning it's very very pigmented it is
a more frosty shimmery shade great for
the brow bone and great for the inner
corner it's like a highlight actually
said you can use it on your freaking as
your cheek bone highlight it is such an
intense frosty golden white shade it's
beautiful it is named Artemis after the
white cat in saying the moon I love the
cats in Sailor Moon I mean the Hello
Sailor Moon Sailor Moon was my entire
 childhood and literally
everything and so I wanted to name it
after the white cat which I just I loved
I loved Artemis and it is a white gold I
thought was super super fitting and a
perfect thing for it
the second shade is beaches and cream
you guys know about peaches and cream is
seriously like one of my favorite shades
to makeup geek by far it is the perfect
transition shade for someone who is more
fair to medium skin tone if your dark
in complexion it's gonna be a really
great highlight like Matt highlight
color like if you're putting like a
matte highlight on the brow bone it's
gonna be great for that but you guys
know I could not leave peaches and cream
out of this palette like that is my life
it is a beautiful matte transition shade
it's not too warm it's not too cool it's
a great transitioning like beige color
it's like a very soft shell color I love
it I'm wearing it today holds our eyes
is my palette but let's not get into
that
yeah so that's peaches and cream the
third shade on the top row is called
Luna and that is named after the black
hat in the Sailor Moon I love this shade
it is a foiled metallic eyeshadow it is
a topi pink shade and when I was
explaining to Maggie peek what I wanted
I told them how I wanted a foiled shave
that is a hybrid between in the
spotlight and grandstand I wanted that
really really pretty bronzy effect both
with more of a pinky tone so that's
exactly what they gave me they gave me
the hybrid brush me in the spotlight in
grandstand in Luna and it's just so
beautiful this is the shadow that was
taking so long to be sent to us because
of the pearls because it is such a high
shine needs like a lot of pearlized
pigment that s'what was taking so long
to get to us to make this pellet but now
that it's here it is worth it I'm so
happy with the color I'm so happy I
turned out so I could not be I can be up
here I could not be happier so that was
the first row let's go to the second row
now so the first color on the second row
is cosmopolitan which is a shade that
McGee already has that is one of the
ones I chose to have with my palette it
is a beautiful rose gold shade it's
literally like gold and rose mixed
together it is a shimmery finish so
you're gonna be put on the lid you can
put in the inner corner it doesn't
really matter you can put it anywhere
you want but it is a very shimmery
shadow that is gold and pink and
reflection so yeah that's cosmopolitan
the middle shade of the entire palette
is named Sora and that is a custom shade
of mine it is a burnt orange transition
shade that's matte and it's just
absolutely perfection it is like my
ultimate transition shade it's a burnt
orange transition who doesn't who
doesn't want a burnt orange transition
that is like what I do as what I do this
everything I want in a transition
burnt orange transition I actually named
this shade after Sora from Kingdom
Hearts Kingdom Hearts was a another
childhood biggy for me I play Kingdom
Hearts literally when I got it like
every single day I remember like when I
beat it I cried I had a plate again it
was a mess it was a mess I was a
mess I was a child a mess but Sora is
named after
the main character Sora and his hair is
like a burnt orange shade so I thought
would be super cool to pay an ode to
Sora the game because it was such a big
part of my life in my palette instead of
getting a tattoo I was gonna get a
tattoo of Kingdom Hearts but I'm like
you know what let me just calm the
down buddy calm down
next one is frappe this is not a consume
say this is from make you puke already
it's described as a maple brown not to
warm up to cool it definitely pulls more
on the warm side because especially like
paired with Sora it is like nice and
warm and beautiful this I swear to you
with beaches and cream Sora and frappe
you will have your crease down like your
crease is done like your Govan you don't
need any other crease shade like
you are good to go I could not be
happier with wrapping it is such a
beautiful shade I know once you guys
apply fret pave your eyes it's done it's
then now moving on to last row there's
no more there's literally only three
left on my own game when I'm rich so the
first shade in the bottom row is
insomnia this is a bluish Brown reflect
II duochrome shade to do a chrome
pigment that mega peak already has and
it is it's so stunning it's absolutely
amazing reminds me of Mac blue brown
pigment but more blue which is what I
wanted like I love Mac blue brown mica
don't get me wrong I do love it it's
such a beautiful shade but I wanted that
effect but to be more blue you cannot
get insomnia pressed unless you're
getting my palette which is a cool cool
way to keep it more custom I mean I've
got insomnia what really really well
with my palette because it is such a
cool different shade it's not like to
everyday shade you're gonna see in the
palette so insomnia love it to death the
second shade on the bottom row is called
Mars and that is a custom shade that is
what I built with makeup geek it's a
very red and maroon color it is a very
it's a very just true red color it's
stunning it's a very pigmented Mars is
actually named after Sailor Mars from
the Sailor Scouts I thought would just
be a perfect name Mars like Mars like
the planet it's right it's a red planet
Mars Sailor Mars was such a badass bitch
and this palettes a badass bitch so Mars
I just it just had to be it just cut it
just came to me Mars a little side note
about this color it is very very very
pigmented so when you swatch it it feels
kind of like gritty and kind of like
drier but because it has so much pigment
in it that's just gonna not just how
it's going to feel don't get too
discouraged of your feels that kind of
dry to you that's totally normal for
like this it is very very hard to get a
red shadow of this nature in a palette
so don't worry about it it is very
pigmented it's very blendable you're
gonna die soon as you swatch it and put
on your eyes it is so beautiful
Mars is probably like my favorite number
one favorite shadow on this palette
because I mean look at it come on it's
perfection and last but not least is
Aphrodite which is a Flemish Brown it is
a very beautiful deep brown shade but
has a hint of Plum to it which makes it
a little more different I wanted a color
that was really really dark and I can
make it really work for any look to make
everything a little bit more darker and
give me more dimension so I chose this
shade Aphrodite just because I wanted to
keep it different and not just not just
that black or a normal map Brown I want
it to be like a cool like brown with
plum undertone you know what I mean I
wanted to make it really cool and
different and I absolutely love this
brown shade I'm wearing it on my outer
corners today and I think it looks
absolutely stunning you can add a little
bit of black to it to make it a little
bit darker you can do so many things
with this shade which is why I wanted to
be my palette I am a huge fan of Greek
mythology which is why I wanted to name
this shape Aphrodite it just felt so
fitting to me every day to use a Greek
god of like love and beauty and
sexuality and I'm like that is this
color it is love and beauty and
sexuality right here so Aphrodite just
seems so perfect as a name to me so
that's why I named the shade Aphrodite
