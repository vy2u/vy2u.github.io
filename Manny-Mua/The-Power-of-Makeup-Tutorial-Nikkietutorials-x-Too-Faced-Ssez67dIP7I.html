using the power of makeup palette by
nikkietutorials
and Too Faced II
so let's going on today's video I just
really wanted to start with the base
done the bases on already I'm good to go
I just need you to eyes today and I
really just wanted to focus on the
nikkietutorials palette with Too Faced
that's really like that's all I wanted
to do so that's kind of what we're just
gonna be focusing on today we're gonna
do the eyes on camera today so this is
the palette I am so so proud of you
Nicki I cannot wait for this to come out
it comes out on August 15th I believe
and it's the power of makeup
collaboration with Too Faced and
nikkietutorials I'm so proud of you babe
okay cool so it's going just get started
on this tutorial
okay I'm gonna mix that shade ivy and
the shade painkiller and Ivy's a nice
just cream white shade and painkillers a
really nice neutral brown and we're
gonna run that into the crease I've
already primed by the way zoom either
then zoom in bitches so we're gonna take
that morphe 27 brush and I'm so excited
that morphe came out with their new
elite 2 collection thank goodness huh
thank goodness because I was so nervous
and so like I didn't even know what was
coming out after the leaked collection
so I'm so happy for them and I'm so
excited about this new launch because
obviously the brushes are so freaking
nice and they're the same like number
scheme as really one collection think
goodness I love morphe I think they did
an absolutely amazing job with this
collection and obviously guys know you
can easily code man um you like to want
to save some money on morphe eye morphe
affiliate I was like you guys know and
of course I'm never trying to push you
guys ever to use my coat ever ever ever
but if you guys do I really do
appreciate it that's just really that's
right sweet you guys thank you this is a
really really really nice neutral Brown
you guys like this is seriously one of
those really good neutrals that you
cannot go wrong with whatsoever it's not
too warm and it's not too cool which is
why I really really really really like
it I'm gonna take a bit of Ivy on the
brow bone just to highlight a little bit
boy a little bit more okay great so we
have the crease down it's just like a
very nice neutral brown shade it's not
too warm it's not too cool it's very
just a true neutral Brown which I love
so now I'm gonna go in with a more
precise brush this is the morphe 17a
part of their new elite collection is
just a nice cute little pointed fluffy
brush and I'm going to take the shade
makeup and show which I love this like
Netflix and Shobha the makeup version
fun I'm gonna put that into the crease a
little bit less pigmented as hell you
see that you see that put that a little
bit lower then we have the previous
shade so we're going to go all the way
in
to the beginning part of our crease with
a very very very light pressure that
we're talking to a heavy pressure
whatsoever it's gonna really focus on
the outer corner and blend very lightly
going in like this would not be a mani
any weight tutorial without my phone
going off
I should really put out my brain huh
beautiful chocolate warm Brown oh I'm
sweating out with the e27 just to make
sure you have no harsh edges or lines
very easy to blend shadows I mean it's
two-faced I literally expected nothing
less super nice shadows to blend with
and I like it a lot so now that we have
the crease completely done it looks nice
just very blended dark on the outer
corner of every blended now we're gonna
go ahead and go in with the fun the fun
colors I've been wanting to go in with
this whole entire time I'm gonna go be
going in with a mystic hour which is a
really cool intense just like a tea like
blueish teal and just super stunning
color it's absolutely beautiful I'm
actually taking on my finger because
usually these kind of shades seem to go
on best with a finger I just I mean
that's just my personal preference with
all with my finger and just go right
over the lid right over oh you guys do
you see that gorgeous happen to
this bout - I'm done I'm dead I'm
 dead I'm dead right on the outer
corner right up to the crease just
patting it in with my finger it's so
 pretty oh I tie dude if
I can dyed it if I can Andy
so I don't go back on with ie a teen and
just blend out those edges make sure
everything's blended really really
nicely between that mystic our shade and
the brown transitions just to make sure
everything's blended pretty looking good
so this is what the top of that I should
look like I think it looks so freakin
pretty it's so bright and just intense
and so aqua and I love it so I'm gonna
go in with a morphe 36 and I'm gonna go
in with the purple just like might as
well we're gonna go colorful let's go
real chlorophyll you know I'm gonna go
in with that shade wham-bam to give very
vibrant purple and I'll run that
underneath the lash line to incorporate
some purple up in this bitch I'm really
just I'm not even being me with you what
so I'm just running this bad boy
underneath the lash line this shade has
like a very pretty sheen to it it's not
like a purple it's like a pinkish
reflected purple it's very very very
wearable and it's so pretty
I'm bringing the purple pretty low
because I just really really want to
make sure that the purple
showing and it's not going to be covered
when I put on mascara you know what I
mean Sarge you want to make sure that
the purple is brought pretty pretty low
taking the same brush and taking a
little bit of wanted which is the black
shade you really just can't go wrong
with black I'm gonna add the on the
outer corner of my eye just give me some
more extra definition and I just blend
that out with an morphe m43 3 just to
make sure we have no harsh and just
again so now I'm gonna grab a morphe 43
and not just gonna go like tight lined
underneath my lash line with a little
bit of the black just to give me a
little bit of more of a papasan theme
you know just a look like very very
little bit basically on the outer corner
mostly only just to give me some added
definition and it's not just all purple
you're having you're adding a little bit
of like let's do it you know go ahead
and line your waterline with a pencil
I'm just gonna grab a blue one because I
wanted to keep kind of on with the theme
of blue I'm gonna take the shade
beasting by clip op it's like their
little clip op gel liners pencils I'm a
living for this waterline I'm uh sorry
I'm seriously living for this waterline
oh I know stop like stop so I think I'm
into a winged liner with this cuz it's
looking just really pretty and I think I
want to add an extra oomph with a little
bit of a wing nut so crazy hopefully
we'll see how it goes
you never know the wing I'm gonna take
the two-faced sketch marker clothing
about this up this actually comes with
the Nicki and Too Faced collaboration
it's a full-size eyeliner marker pen
which is just so freakin cool that the
fact that even comes with that as well
so we're just gonna do a little bit of
eyeliner doing you want
I'm just fill it in so now we have the
liner on and we have lashes on as well I
just wanted to add the lashes on wazoo
and the linings it's just so much easier
that way I'm wearing the lashes at
Serengeti buying New Balance um you guys
know I love the new bouncing lashes
they're just so good use these so many
so many times
and I've seen there's such a really
pretty fun wispy flare epared but before
I assume you guys have to see what they
look like up close
I'm gonna go and add a little bit of the
shade sugar-coated from Nicky's palette
on my inner corner of my eyes just to
give me a little bit of pop of something
a little pop of something in inner
corner cause it's really really dark
right now going on so we're going to add
a little bit of a pink highlight to
emphasize the inner corner oh that color
is so pretty
Oh Mikey okay great so the eyes are done
I'm gonna go ahead and zoom you guys in
to see what they look like up close
I'll be great so we are done with the
eyes now I think they turned out super
super super cool and very just different
and unique and I love this look I'm
gonna go and move on to the lips now I'm
gonna go in with another collaborators
lip product kathleenlights my baby girl
love yeah I'm gonna be going in with the
shade at point zero this is more of a
cool tone brown shade and I thought it
would go really really nice with this
eye look because it's more of a neutral
and I mean I feel like I feel very like
grungy 90s right now so might as well go
in with a lip that's kind of grungy 90s
you'd feel me so we're going with this
look this is the colour-pop ultra satin
lip in the shade point-0 clad with again
kathleenlights absolutely amazing these
are not that liquid lipsticks these are
like a honey and how would you describe
these these are like lip sticks in the
liquid form but they're not matte
they're not hazmat you know I'm saying
they last a long time with lips but
they're not ultra matte so I like that
I'm very pigmented as you can see love
maybe I should have lip line huh and
this is a with the shade a point zero I
never do colors like this I don't know
why I always shy away from doing really
cool tone lip shades but this color is
absolutely stunning and I think it's so
so pretty and I think in compliments
this look very very well because it is
very much more of a neutral shade but I
think it turned out so so nicely and
yeah this is the final look hope you
guys enjoy it
