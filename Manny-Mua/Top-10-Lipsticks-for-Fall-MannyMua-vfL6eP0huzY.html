today is going to be a top 10 fall
lipstick favorites you know I asked on
snapchat what you guys wanted to see if
coming up for this Friday and I got a
couple requests to do like a top 10
favorites for fall kind of lipsticks
like my favorite lipsticks for fall and
I thought this would be such a fun video
to do and I'm like I don't thing I've
ever done anything like this where it's
like I'm picking a top favorites of
something for season like I've never
done that half of the lipsticks I have
are more on the like higher-end price
like $20 and above and then I have five
that are like not so expensive so I'm
really excited to this video because I
know I get a lot of flack for not using
a lot of like drugstore products or more
like cost-efficient products or like an
expensive products you don't I mean so
hopefully this will help you guys out if
you guys have a budget from low to high
this should be a video for you guys you
as always if you guys don't this video
you guys like me please don't
watch it that's like the missable hair
that I don't have the I feel like I
don't want your hair like let me just
catch you on this side I think I do like
this video you can join me please like
this video and subscribe to my channel
if you aren't already and if you're new
hello welcome to my channel my name is
Manny anyway and I am a crazy bitch wait
let's go and get into this video top ten
lipsticks full hole I'm ready like the
higher in lipsticks first and like the
lower end lipsticks second of the video
so order to do is where to start with
like the more muted colors so first ones
first about this so many times on my
channel like not so many times like
three times count how many like the
other by now so this is the shade
Veronica Vienna sausage Beverly Hills it
is a gorgeous like ma be dusty brownish
purple what the we just watch a few
guys so I don't like sound like an idiot
so basically this shade is a stunning
like mauve brownish purple shade looks
like this as with some gray tones too
and some more purple tones to it it has
some brown tones to it is absolutely
stunning I think it's the perfect fall
shade for someone who is really like
wanting to go out and be daring and do
like a lip like mine they want to do
like more of a muted toned down look but
still be very fall appropriate Veronica
is your bed I love this shade to death
the next one is by Urban Decay it is the
shade 1993 it is a stunning like sepia
type brown color let me show you what it
looks like it looks like this it's like
a very brownish happy economy one swatch
it SMR
Thank You Emily they do look similar in
tone they definitely are but this one
has a lot more brown and gray to it so
it's a lot more like muted down for
example like it is definitely more of a
true sepia type of color than this one
this was a lot more pinkish for me
personally I like to wear this one more
because I'm just like more into like the
more pink tones like I just like I just
like pains you know if you're more into
like the more like sepia tones and more
Browns the more like Kylie Jenner desk
type 1993 will be an obsession for you I
love this color this is such like a
perfect like 90s grunge look and if
you're into that kind of look for fall
1993 by urban decay you will be living
and breathing in it trust a bitch so the
last of my more muted tone down fall
colors is by Justin colors this is in
the shade truffle I am obsessed not only
am i obsessed with the dose of colors
like lipsticks because I think they're
one of the best in the whole entire
Beauty game I kid you not if you guys
have had the doesn't colors liquid
lipsticks you know they're one of the
best ever but this color though you
swatch it
let me just wash the bench mmm so gentle
is a very muted down peachy pink color
it is more peach than pink though so you
actually see right here if you are
someone that likes to do more nudes
during the fall and are really into just
like oh my nudist shades and not really
into like the bold intense fall colors
totally cool nothing against it like
that's just personal preference but if
you are into that kind of stuff
I would definitely check out Chapel
honestly I kind of want to take off this
up and put on truffle like I'm kind of
obsessed with it like I'm not even
kidding it is that vomity sorry good
so the fourth higher-end shade color is
actually Kat Von D Vampira or Vampira
Matic vampiress on so much better like
them by really so this is a sheen of
pirate it is a gorgeous oxblood color
without soon I love Kat Von D the
lipsticks you guys know this I love them
they're so beautiful so vampire is
definitely more of like a deep blackened
berry color it is so so so deep in dark
as you can see obviously but it does
have a lot of like Baroness to it with
you or to like thin it out it looks like
kind of like more on the berry sides and
just beautiful and I just I need to do
tutorial with that because it's a good
next and last of the higher end ones is
a Geoffrey start unicorn blood again
I've totally mentioned this before and I
think it's
stat Ning so this is Jeffrey star
unicorn blood it is definitely more of a
oxblood
warm tone than Vampira beffre as you can
see it's lot more bearing this not like
more purple and this one is a lot more
reddish and more like maroon and deep
like Alex bloody so I actually love the
Geoffrey start liquid lipsticks I've
done a whole entire video on Jeffrey
stars liquid lipsticks I think they're
amazing some of the liquid lipsticks are
better than others that's not like
that's the truth I'm not like
transaction about the lipsticks at all I
think some of them are better than other
ones univer blood is one of my favorite
colors by him because I think it is such
a universal like gorgeous shade looks
good on literally literally every single
person ever Jeffrey I you're a liquid
lip thanks boy I really do and unicorn
blood is definitely not an exception I
think it's stunning check that one out
if you could if you can I mean take a
hint so those are my top 5 for more
higher-end lipstick products that these
right here
so now dwindling down in price these are
the top five that are in a more
reasonable price range and that
reasonable just like in a lower price
range you know to me let's go and start
off with my three favorite Mac ones I
have three for Mac for fall I think
these are fall in a Dobby in a little is
fallen aloof let's go and start off with
studded kiss so I would say studded kiss
is definitely a deep maroon but a little
bit more warmth in it than the average
moon color it is so stunning it can be
sheared out to be like more pinkish it's
just absolutely gorgeous I think this is
actually one of the newer ellipses that
they did like recently I know they just
came out with more mats but I think
steady kiss is one of them and I saw it
and I literally had to buy cuz it's such
a gorgeous like berry ish maroon shade
for fall stunning studded kiss get it
get it get it next one is my all-time
favorite lipstick from Mac for fall ever
see my number one it is sin
it is stunning I'm gonna swatch it next
to it oh so good it makes it look like a
deeper version of studded kiss just a
little bit more purple so it's just this
is what it looks like I used to wear
this at Mac when I worked at Mac all the
time you guys how it works in all the
time with burgundy lip liner sin and
Burgundy together I would sell that
like a like it was my job to
sell it which it was but like I could
sell a like done like so easily
it's just such a beautiful fall shade
and then last but not least I have a Mac
one antique velvet which is a very deep
brownish shade
at his antique velvet it is just very
true warm brown I feel like a lot of
like warmer lipsticks look good on with
so much more people than like cool tone
ones that's just my personal opinion so
I think antique velvet is absolutely
stunning I'm actually wearing sin and
antique velvet on my lips right now I
have sin as my Basin antique velvet on
top and I think it looks so so so cool I
think such a cool like brownish maroon
shade I think it looks absolutely
stunning and like I'm so into this lip
right now cannot get over it died so
those are all three front back which is
more of an easily accessible brand and
it's not as expensive like fifteen or
sixteen bucks so check those out from
Mac they're stunning you will not be
disappointed at any of those or you I
don't think unless you know like brown
lipstick or like deep lipsticks then
like you might be this morning last two
of my more inexpensive ones one is by
color pop this is the colour-pop lippie
stick in moshpit is a matte shade and
the last one is the Maybelline Color
sensational lipstick in burgundy blush
I'd use this in my full face drugstore
tutorial
it is stunning this is like one my
favorite lipstick see it is so nice and
the formulas amazing and I'm obsessed
with burgundy blush living breathing
dying in burgundy so it's going to
swatch this lighter one first so I'm
gonna go and swatch moshpit by color by
first gonna open it this one smells good
honestly Claire pumpkin chooses to share
me because I'll smell a lipstick I think
it smells like so bad it smells like so
weird they all smell another one it
smells like good in like vanilla and
pretty and I'm like what what the
what the what's going on here so
this one's not a bad one whatsoever
thank God so this one is in the shade
mosh pit I think this shade oh my god is
so stupid bomb this is what it looks
like it kind of reminds me like of like
a shade like Veronica by a massage about
the hills the cutter whines Eve that has
like that like purplish that brownish
that grayish tone to it it is very
similar to like Mac like twig this lippy
stick is so stunning if you guys can get
a color probably be sick they're only
five dollars
it's such an affordable price cells are
so amazing and this one is absolutely
bomb moshpit dude and then last but not
least the Maybelline Color sensational
lipstick in burgundy blush oh my god
like how are they honestly like how are
they so pigmented and so bomb honestly
honestly it is a very beautiful deep
darkened maroon shade it is very similar
to like Mac's in but I even like this
color sensational formula a little bit
better it is just so friggin nice I
cannot get enough of Burgundy blush and
I can't get enough of the color
sensational by Maybelline they're bomb I
think they're like well
- seventy bucks but that's so so good
for the quality that you're getting
that's like so amazing I was so shocked
when I first tried that but I was like
what oh how good they were so Maybelline
they killed it with the formula so yeah
hope you guys liked this video I had so
much fun doing this one this is just a
different video for me when I got that
request I was like dude that sound like
such a fun idea to do like a favorite
fall lipstick video like that sounds so
cool I didn't feel like a Lafayette a
lot of good use out of it even if you
have a higher budget or a lower budget
doesn't even matter like you're gonna be
able to get good quality lipsticks and I
think all these lipsticks are great
quality and I would not suggest
something that I don't love for you guys
