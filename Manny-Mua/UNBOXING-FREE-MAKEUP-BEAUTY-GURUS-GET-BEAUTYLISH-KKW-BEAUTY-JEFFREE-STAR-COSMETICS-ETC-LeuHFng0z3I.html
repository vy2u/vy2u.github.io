are you guys doing I feel like it's been
so long since I films I've been out of
town recently you know I've been doing
so many I went to VidCon I want
Ohio for a wedding today's video is
going to be a full PR unboxing I did one
of these videos about a month and half
ago almost two months ago I went over so
when you guys loved it so I was like
okay cool I'm gonna do another one of
these I believe I asked you guys in this
video if you guys wanted to see me do a
series of unboxings and using the PR I
literally just got in the next video and
a lot of you guys did say yes and
combine those two videos have over 2.5
million views so I'm like you know what
I think they like them yeah so yeah it
says video is going to be a PR unboxing
just so you guys can see some of the
random things that beauty influencers
get online sometimes it's makeup
sometimes it's not like this random
things you never really know online
before I can start on this video I try
to say a huge huge thank you to Beauty
lish because we are partnering up in
this video this video is sponsored with
Beauty lish and I'm just so excited
because I've worked with beuliss before
and I think they're a wonderful
wonderful company and I wanna say thank
you guys so much for wanting to sponsor
me you know I don't really get a lot of
it I've talked about this before but I
don't get a lot of sponsorships you know
and the ones I do get are from brands I
don't want to use so when I do a
sponsorship is really special to me
because I don't really get to do them
very often and it just means a lot when
a brand believes in me and doesn't want
to change my opinions or want to make me
seem like I'm someone that I'm not
because that's never gonna happen
so thank you to be delicious for
believing in me as a man emu a and not
trying to change me but we'll get more
into their brand later on in the video
as always if you guys don't in this
video if you guys do not like me please
don't watch it you know the
drill with that but if you guys do like
this video please subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and if
you're new what's up I'm an emu and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here I really genuinely
appreciate it from the bottom of my
heart
Breanna is going into this PR unboxing
so in case you guys are not aware of
what I'm doing technically what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna do a PR unboxing
and I'm gonna be using the makeup I use
in this PR boxing in a tutorial like
literally right after I'm done unboxing
it and that will be going up in the next
few days let start the first box and of
course is going to be a beauty lish
package so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna start off with butyl ish and we
have some products from the beauty list
hm-hm-hm first thing I want to talk
about really quickly is the ordinary I
talked about before in different videos
a favorites videos I talked about on
snapchat the ordinary is a skincare
brand that I sold on Beauty lish and
they are a really really inexpensive
skincare brand these are the things I
use the most I use the retinol one
percent and I use the advanced retinoid
2% I interchange them when depending on
how much I want to slough off my skin a
reason I'm not wearing makeup right now
is I kinda wanted to show like I'm not
wearing any makeup at all right now and
I feel like the texture of my skin has
really improved don't get me wrong I
have texture I have gnarly pores I'm a
dude that's just what it is but I feel
like it's really definitely improved and
I do genuinely believe that it's from
the ordinary using these two products
and six and eight dollars like you
really cannot beat those prices and the
ordinary has tons tons of stuff like for
example natural moisturizing factors
plus H a Azalea acid suspension 10% aah
eight thirty plus either how to read
they have such a wide variety of
products that it would fit any skin type
you can find a product for you from the
ordinary and I honestly would highly
suggest checking some other stuff out on
Beauty - what awesome beauty - we got
the Cicely Black Rose skin infusion
cream plumping and radiance masks okay
honestly Jeffrey is like a freaking huge
fanatic of Cicely and he's one that
always tells me you have to use this new
product somebody skincare talk to you
also loves them too so I'm excited so I
got a couple shadows from sugarpill
which is a really cool indie brand that
has really bright intense ass shadows I
absolutely love them for like bright
intention we got this Charlotte Tilbury
instant look into pallets five-minute
face on the go let's open this girl I
love I love Charlotte Tilbury and also
with that we got a matte revolution
luminous modern and matte long-lasting
lipstick in the shade below talked she
got this little cheek on the go pal
which is actually really cool we have
the face highlight face bronzed
cheek cheek pop cheeks wish I smoked i
enhance and I brighten we have the beca
x chrissy teigen face palette and this
is what she looks like i have not tried
this out yet and we have a plethora of
the new england a quest ik a qu AST I
see acrostic acrostic equesticle a cur
cream eyeshadow bitin glut let's open
one of these up and see what they look
like whoo so liquid shadow let's see a
swatch oh oh I'm sorry I didn't realize
you guys weren't planning on so that's
it for it be a beauty list products I
just wanted to say one thing about you
dish that I absolutely love about them
in case you guys didn't know they are an
online retailer that has sells so many
different brands they have Jeffrey's
brand they have so many different brands
on them I absolutely love butyl ish and
what's really really cool about their
brand is that they have flexible payment
which means you can make payments on
your actual payment for example so if
you bought something that one hundred
dollars total you can have three months
to pay it out rather than just pay it in
one total and you have to pay for the
first like one third of the payment
right than in there IG that's really
awesome you know like you don't have the
money to pay for the whole thing but you
still want that product you can make
monthly payments on it and I've never
heard of online like makeup company
being able to do that so huge huge kudos
to you a beauty list you're doing
something so badass and different and
that's it for beauty list products let's
move on to some more of these of these
be out of magazines what do we have here
next week
is that stain it so we have this package
from Kim kardashian-west Beauty Kim kW
Judy I went to her event recently where
I met Kim Kardashian she was so sweet so
professional just actually look just a
nice genuinely sweet person and I really
really enjoyed that but of course at the
event we got the k'kaw Beauty contour
and highlighting sticks which look like
this I have not tried them yet so I'm
thinking in the next video I have to try
them I feel like there's been there's
been a lot of reviews has been a lot of
controversy on how these work I'm very
very brutal and upfront and honest with
the reviews that I do so I'm going to
trying these out in the next video and
we will see how they work on me where
they work on me who knows I'm hoping I
really genuinely hope they
because I always want products to work I
mean your people are spending money on
it I want them to work but we
will see if the products actually work
or not but we will definitely be using
the contour and highlighting six in the
next video next is this really exciting
