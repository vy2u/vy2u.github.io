no giggle today cuz my friends make fun
of mine giggle in real life just kidding
what's up you guys so I decided that I
wanted to do a little intense
PR unboxing out of the boxes right
behind him to me grabbing behind me I
was gonna do one on snapchat and I'm
like wait I kind of orange do one on
YouTube and just open up a bunch of
things just because recently I saw a
video from Tati here on YouTube I'm sure
you guys are well aware of her she's
absolutely amazing she's like the queen
of everything really I guess but I'm
she's super super cool and I saw her do
some unboxings recently and I was
actually really really intrigued and I
was watching them so intensely and I'm
like what are you getting so since I
always do snapchat unboxings I thought I
would take it to youtube and do a big PR
unboxing just show you guys some of the
random ass stuff that beauty influencers
get or Beauty youtubers get it's pretty
funny and sooo a random there's a lot of
boxes there's a lot of papers a lot of
noodles a lot of ribbon there's a lot of
things going on so I thought we really
fun to do this as always if you guys
like this video if you guys don't like
me please don't fucking watch it you
know Joel thing and if you're new what's
up a Manny MUA and welcome to my channel
thank you so much for being here random
side note I'm not wearing any makeup
right now I'm not wearing primer no
concealer and literally no nothing
because I thought it would really really
fun to turn this video it's gonna be a
two-parter so I'm gonna do the unboxing
right now unboxing a bunch of random
boxes and then using those products I
unboxed in my next video so basically
I'm gonna try to upload tomorrow when
you're watching this which I put
tomorrow the next day and I'm gonna do
the tutorial using all the products I
literally just unboxed and see if
they're good or not it's literally give
me a first impressions of this unboxing
that I just did so right after I'm done
filming this unboxing I'm going to put
the makeup on and film that as well I
just I would be kind of fun to turn this
into a little like two-parter make it a
little different for you guys to see if
you guys wanted to see that heaven whoo
so now let's go ahead and get into this
pyaare unboxing madness
okay guys let's go and start this
unboxing with this first box this was
actually the biggest actual box that I
had so I unboxed it downstairs because
it was honestly too big
I couldn't ring it upstairs I couldn't
even fit it back here I was like this is
crazy there better be some massive
esting in here for there to be such a
massive box and there wasn't so that
kind of gets on your nerves right upside
no I'm sure this also happens to other
Beauty people in the industry when you
get like this massive massive massive
box with all this massive paper in it
and you got a good product that's like
that big and it's like dude you are
seriously fucking with the environment
so hard when you do that brands we ever
watch this try to be more conscious of
the environment and paper and usage of
cardboard it sucks to see that much
paper and stuff like that being used
when the product is like this big and I
only say that because I want to be more
conscious of our ecological footprint
and wanting it to be just lessened not
using too much paper and things like
that so I know that's random I know I
never really talked about that but I try
to be more conscious of using excessive
amounts of paper cardboard and things
like that when you don't have to so
random sign out sorry tangent just try
to save the world here so what I got is
the Mac next to nothing foundation so
what it looks like this is the cool
packaging only have DNA and we have the
little foundations oh I've heard about
this that this is a very very very
lightweight almost non-existent formula
of foundation smells like Studio Fix
things like to actually just watch the
Laura's video on it recently and I'm
like hmm this is not really what I'm
gonna like because I'm a full-coverage
kind of girl but we will see in the next
video what I think about it so I'm gonna
try this on and also came with the
little powder so the next product
actually unbox on my snapchat I asked
you guys if you guys want to see a video
and you guys did say yes but I thought I
would just kind of include it in this
letter won't do a whole full dedicated
video on the Kylie cosmetics blushes and
highlighters I've heard variant mix
things about them I've heard that they
suck I heard that they're great I've
heard so many different things so I'm
like I'm very very intrigued by them I
really don't want to try the blushes out
as well haven't tried any of them yet at
all so Mac let's do this first
impressions in the next video I'm very
excited okay I shouldn't I shouldn't say
shit I should not shake shit so we have
the next package right here from the
este edit so what we have in here yeah
bee sting hmm

cardboard cut between the web of my
fingers I would fucking scream are you

have in here we have the flash
illuminator well we have the flash
illuminator light flash illuminator and
morning light poor vanishing moisturizer
which sounds great that's probably uses
in the next video we have the flash
illuminator fluid liquid and the flash
illuminator and spotlight
I think I just haven't tried enough
products from the este edit to really to
save the brand's great or not um it's my
personal opinion I just haven't used
enough of their products yet but so far
the things I have use I'm not like blown
away with but the eyeliners are fucking
amazing I want to try the pour vanishing
moisturizer which is a matte hydrator
and primer in one so that's a that's a
bold claim support okay next we have a
box from colour-pop oh let me take out
these noodles these make me want to
scream Zia loves them and that's why
because she gets them all over the house

I get with you guys because a lot of
times I'm just really doing it for you
guys you know a lot of times

talk about them for you so it makes me
excited when you brands come out with
new product to see if they're good or if
they're not good
I don't I don't like being mean you know
like I feel bad I don't like to be mean
to brands but you got to be honest and

look like I'm bragging in any way shape
or form this is what I do full-time this
is my career I am a beauty youtuber full
time so part of being a beauty youtuber
is receiving a PR to talk about it for
promotional purposes and I just want
this video to look like I'm bragging in
any way shape or form because I'm not
this is just what I do for a living and
I know sometimes it can look like really
annoying like really he's getting warm

the makeup to and I totally understand
that so I hope you understand this is
coming from a loving place and it's
coming from like a knowledgeable place

wanted to test them out or not it's like
when you work at a plastic surgeon's
office and you get free Botox
