channel as you can see today no beat on
the face I'm gonna be testing out a new
foundation shade theme the Urban Decay
all nighter waterproof long wear liquid
foundation I've actually been getting so
many requests to review this foundation
I'll be what I'm asking what my thoughts
have been on it and I haven't ever tried
to get so I figured Mike will do a first
impressions demo and kind of come back
in a couple hours and see what we
thought of it the Urban Decay foundation
so I'm starting off with a blank face I
have nothing on my face other than
moisturizer so I'm gonna go and do my
normal average routine that I would do
if I was doing a face so I'm gonna start
with primer I'm gonna take the Make Up
For Ever smoothing primer I put way too
much oh sorry about that
you're gonna feel that one this is a
great primer for me because I am more on
the oily side and this really does help
smooth out my pores makes him look
smaller as well as Kimya less oily just
kind of pressing it in my face feels
like a dolphin's vagina now I'm gonna go
on straight away with the foundation I
might go half of the face I'm gonna put
on with a Beauty Blender and the other
half I'm gonna go on with a stippling
brush I just thing that's gonna help
differentiate between people that use
Beauty butters and you'll use brushes
I'm gonna take a pump of this can you
see that I can see already that it is a
thicker consistency it's not moosie but
it is definitely thick it's not runny
whatsoever it's like there and it ain't
going nowhere so it's a thicker
consistency is what I'm saying this is
in the shade I have to shade at 3.0 I
know they have a different like
numbering system I think the point fives
are like pink the point two fives are
neutral and V like point o's are yellow
more of a yellow tone I wish I had two
0.25 because I don't think this is
actually going to match my color of my
face but we're gonna kind of go with it
just so I can review this foundation so
I just don't have the other color so I'm
gonna use a Beauty Blender for half the
face Oh with DES okay let you see how
applies i developing this color is a
little bit too light for me but the
coverage is there it is definitely a
more fuller coverage for sure
not patchy whatsoever it looks really
really really really nice actually we're
gonna Pat that in about half of my face
I'm gonna look so pale after this I'm
have to bronze up for days whoa
this is probably a color that would
actually match my neck but you guys know
I like to be more to him it just looks
like it's not my color because in my
eyes it's not Oran continue to put it on
over the ears
okay so right away I noticed that it
goes on very lightweight it's definitely
not heavy feeling I don't feel like it's
heavy on the face whatsoever which is
pretty nice I don't like it when it
feels too heavy on the face let me look
closely to see what it looks like up
close the finish I would say is
definitely more of a natural matte
finish I would not say it's luminous
whatsoever it's
more than Matt tight but it's not
completely flat I've had much more
mattifying foundations in the past so
this is definitely at not as Matt as I'm
used to let's go and put a little bit
more on top of my cheeks just to see how
it built and see how it looks then they
have to be careful with the layering
because I feel if you layer another
layer on top it will definitely look
pretty heavy and pretty cakey one layer
looks pretty good but - it's looking
pretty masky if you tell me okay
cool
so I have one side of the face done the
coverage is beautiful it's nice and
medium to full coverage I would
definitely say it's more on the neat
full side and let's see is it picking up
on my dry patches I would say if you are
more on the dry side this might pick up
on your dry patches a little bit because
the finish is more so on the mattifying
side go and try it on with a brush on
the opposite side so going on I'm pretty
happy with it
first off looks really beautiful it's
nice full coverage but now I'm going to
take this foundation on a morphe six and
just kind of put it on my face and buff
in the coverage with a brush so there oh
my sweet lord so with the brush you will
get a lot more product down it
definitely will be more of a fuller
coverage and you use less product if
you're using it with a brush doesn't
soak up nearly as much so I am noticing
a little bit on my nose I feel like the
foundation is kind of bunching up in my
pores and it's me it's kind of
emphasizing the pores on my nose which
kind of annoys me I don't really like
that I think that looks you know this is
not a cute thing whatsoever so I'm just
in take the Beauty Blender with nothing
else on and I'm trying to kind of press
over it to kind of flatten it out
whenever I go in with a brush I always
go over it with a beauty but anyway just
cuz I want to give it more of a
airbrushed finish and that's kinda what
we're doing so right now I'll do that
and going on with the brush gives you
more coverage but it also gives you more
of a texture appearance which is kind of
annoying so that is it with the
application the application is nice it's
nice and full coverage okay so first
impression the coverage is very much
there it's a nice full coverage
appearance especially when using it with
a brush the coverage is freaking fair
it's really really nice if you are more
on the dry side I think it will pick up
on your dry
patches because it is definitely more of
a mattifying foundation for sure I think
it just kind of pick up on my little
pores on my notes but I think I can kind
of use a powder puff and powder will
kind of help conceal it a little bit so
what we're gonna do now is I'm gonna go
and do the rest of my face I'm gonna do
some concealer and whatnot and I'm gonna
come back in a couple hours and I'm
going to conceal now taking my go-to
right now my Tarte shape tape I'll put
that underneath the eyes just to see how
everything how it blends together with
the foundation and see if it works
nicely on the t-zone blending out over
the foundation seamlessly there's no
it's not hard to blend out over the Sun
nation whatsoever it's not making it
weird at all which is really really nice
now let's see how this foundation looks
after you set it with some powder so I'm
gonna take the alarm RCA translucent
powder and a more 40:41 I'm going to
press this all over the face to see how
it sets see how it picks up how does it
look when you set it with some powder
cool so now that said let's go and see
what we think of clothes I think it
honestly looks pretty flawless
and I think that's actually the powder
though the powder is making it look
amazing but slightly I do think that it
is emphasizing my texture in my drier
areas which kind of annoys me especially
around the perimeters my face which I am
more dry on I'm oiling the t-zone
okay so first impressions I like it I
don't love it I'm not obsessed but I do
think that it is really really really
nice there's a couple hiccups in the
foundation I don't really like
personally but I think it could be my
skin type so if you are definitely more
on the oily side I think you guys will
really really like it so now we have the
powder down let's go ahead and see how
it looks with bronzer and my blush and
things like that so let's see how it
takes other products and see if it works
out in our favor or not first let's
powder up this neck because Mama's
looking a little person now let's see
how the foundation takes some bronze I'm
take the Marc Jacobs tantric bronzer my
favorite bronzer on a morphe tube and
see how this looks let's see how it's
taken it nice there's no patchiness it's
taking it pretty pretty well doesn't
look odd picks up really really nicely
there's no patchiness foundation is not
making you look patchy it whatsoever
which is really really good LT lets up
here we're a little more sweaty that's
my fault not the foundation for it's
funny how much darker the bronzer looks
on me when I use a very much lighter
foundation it's pretty funny on
for me but the bronzer is going on very
very nicely very seamlessly the
foundation isn't picking up on the
bronzer whatsoever which is really nice
and so I'm making a look patchy at all
which I approve of many anyway brood
right now we're looking snatched
we sure are
okay so now that's going with some blush
so for blush I'm going with a peachy
blush I'm gonna take these you a blush
in a peach bouquet these blushes are so
nice they're very very pigmented and so
pretty oh stop
I just became a Jew affiliate so I'm
kind of excited because I I only really
start affiliating myself with brands if
I really do love the brand and I think
the brand is really nice and I think
they deserve more recognition so jouer
is a brand I think definitely deserves
more recognition I think they're so
awesome and the products are absolutely
beautiful stunning like the products are
stunning packaging the packaging that's
the only thing that I'm like not gung-ho
on with the brand but everything else
they slay dude they
Soleil you use my code man you're way on
joy products and you can save 15% off 15
a lot whose bouquet is literally looking
stunning on me yeah we do a little bit
cooking underneath the bronzer just a
little bit just a little bitty Crocker
mommy Baba mm-hmm okay
everything's looking snatched I like it
so far I wish we highlight with hmm I
want to go in with definitely more of a
golden once I I thought my look I'm
gonna do I look and I look later on and
I went to more yellow so I want to keep
it on the yellow theme so for highly I'm
gonna go in with the sleek Solstice
palette
I'm so excited because sleek just posted
on Twitter recently bad they are
available in u.s. now so that's really
really exciting so I'm gonna go on with
a morphe m2m 510
I'm just highlight using that nice a
really pretty peach shade amazing so the
face is basically done I'm gonna go and
wait a couple hours now and I will come
back very very soon till you guys know
how it's looking after a couple hours
right now it's looking really nice it's
setting into the skin very nicely
so for the person that was kind of like
go ahead and know how I felt about it in
the beginning but it's definitely
getting a little bit better as my face
is starting to like accept the product
so I'll be right back
let you know how everything goes ok guys
so it has been a good five hours since I
first applied the foundation usually if
I'm way out to an event I'll be wearing
it for a good like five hours unless I'm
like starting in the beginning of the
day at like 10 a.m. and I'm not going
back till 2 that's an exception but I
must say that this foundation is really
really holding up quite well there's no
like feigning in the foundation
whatsoever there's no like parts of the
face that's showing like just my skin
and my bronzer and blush are still
showing my highlighter so showing it
didn't eat it up so I definitely think
that this foundation is pretty freaking
sweet man
it's definitely approved by me so far
sadly I can't wear it for any longer
except ago I would definitely say that
this foundation is definitely a hit I'm
not going to say it's a Miss there's
parts of the foundation I wish that were
a little bit better like parts like
picking up on my dryer patches I don't
like that that kind of gets on my nerves
but the foundation does look absolutely
beautiful especially now that it's like
set into my face and settled in I feel
like it looks absolutely beautiful it's
porcelain on camera and it's porcelain
in person as well so I think it looks
really really nice as my face oils and
face like just starts to mesh with
the foundation you know I am so I don't
think that the foundation is absolutely
beautiful so if you guys are interested
especially if you are more on the oily
normal combo side I would definitely
check out the Urban Decay all nighter ok
this video is not sponsored by the way
let me just say that this video is not
sponsored I wish it was from decay if
you ever want to I'm here homie I am
 here but definitely I would say
that this foundation has its major perks
has a couple minuses but perks more I
definitely will check out the Urban
Decay all nighter waterproof foundation
it freaking is staying on quite well 5
to 6 hours later it has a bunch of
 at all and it still is looking
quite flawless so I would definitely say
that this is a manually approved is
working pretty darn well if you are dry
well you like this I honestly don't know
I'm not dry but I think it does pick up
on the dry patches quite a bit and that
kind of annoys me so if that annoys me
and I don't have that much dry skin can
imagine someone who is trying to pick it
up but yeah this foundation I think it's
gonna really work for me I'm excited to
try it out some more so yeah I hope you
