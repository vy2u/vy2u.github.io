a whirlwind of a month um October was so
so crazy for me and I just want to sit
down and talk to you guys about it just

intense and a lot of like just
realization and just a lot of opening up
about things and so I just wanted to
kind of make this video and just to kind
of sit chitchat talk with you guys I
feel like I'm done so long and I know I
have snapchat and stuff and I get to do
that on snapchat but on my youtube

be I'm just going to sit down to chat

filming some videos after this so might
as well just do that right now as always
if you guys don't like this video you
guys to like me please don't
watch it you literally know the Jo with
that I say it in every single video do
not subject yourself to watch me if you
guys do not like me I get it I'm not
everyone's cup of tea people either love
me or they hate me there's usually no
in-between for me so if you don't like
me just don't watch the video please if
there's no point but if you guys do like
this video please give it a thumbs up
and subscribe to my channel if you

I mean anyway and welcome to my channel
and thank you so much for being here
first things first promotional by
benefit of course when people just get
raising these chitchat get ready to even
like talk about the product that they're
using imma go on so long I don't even
know what the I'm doing okay
beginning of the month what I do knocked
over was such a whirlwind you guys it
was a whirlwind to end all whirlwind I
went to Bora Bora this month and it was
freaking gnarly as it was so much
fun honestly we wit with tart and I'm
such an amazing amazing fun s trip I
still can't even believe that we went it
was so crazy they launched a couple new
products while we were there and some of
the stuff I was obsessed with the
highlighting palette
I love the eyeshadow palette I'm so
beyond obsessed with it was so so nice
they had some really good stuff and I'm
just so happy that that Bryan is doing
so well because they have been so so so
good to me and they've done so many
amazing things for so many other
different people as well honestly I was
a little nervous going on the trip
because like when brands do these trips
and they talk about like they launch new
products like they have to be good you
know what I mean like I'm not gonna snap
about their products if they're not good
like not to be a bitch or anything but
that's not honest and I don't that's not
like what I do whatever I go on the
trips I'm always so anxious
 if I don't like these like I'm so
sorry to the brand but I'm not gonna
talk about it I'm not gonna be dishonest
with you guys did you guys I'm on a
freaking trip I'm on a trip whenever you
know like it just it's just cool that I
got lucky enough to go on a trip with
the brand that I really like and the
products are really great so I'm so so
so happy you have no idea so funny how
now with like the new lighting like the
foundation looks like it matches me a
lot more I haven't really changed my
routine a lot people are saying in my
last video like oh my god wow man he
actually looks like his colour for once
like holy crap man II actually found a
foundation that matches him you guys
have been using the same
foundation for so long it's been the
same routine for so so so long and just
funny because a lot people are trying to
clock me and trying to like read me and
being like oh my god man he's not Orange
Wow like he set the oompa-loompa free
like it was like ridiculous and I was
like guys like I literally like don't
give a single solitary the lighting
is just a lot better now it's like more
true to lighting this is like what it
looks like in real life it's like my
other lighting which I had like color
correct like a just to get
it to look even like a little normal but
whole lighting was not good so hopefully
you guys are enjoying this kind of
lighting this is a lot better for me
this is a much better setup it's much
more true color and it just it's just so
much better
yeah back to bora-bora so honestly it
was the most amazing trip I've ever been
on
I was lucky enough to go twice this year
to Bora Bora I went with Jeffery who was
like one my best friend's obviously you
guys know this and I went with Tarte for
their brand trip which is so much fun I
feel like I've been really really
blessed this year to be able to go on
two brand trips get to go in to more
aboard ships it's been a really really
really amazing year and I'm so grateful
you know and I know it's just like it's
a trip like oh my god like mani really
like a grateful for your purchase but
it's like you guys don't understand like
my life was so different you know it was
a lot more rough in the past so so any
opportunity that I've been given it's
like I'm so grateful for it you know
it's like it's crazy it actually makes
me laugh cuz a lot of people try to bag
on me for being ungrateful or um like
not being humble anymore or things like
that because I have more expensive
things how in the no honestly
chilli tell me how in the actual is
someone not humble anymore just because
they have more they have nicer things
now I don't understand that like how is
like because you have nice things
doesn't mean that as a person you're not
humble you know what I mean like I
literally do not get it like if you can
explain that to me please do in the
comments I just been a lot more blessed
recently you know and I don't get it
when people are like oh my god you're so
you've changed you're all about money
now and dadadada done
like no I'm actually not and nothing's
changed other than the fact that I have
a little bit more money than used to and
my I liked a lot better and I'm happier
now it's been accessorizing of
Jacqueline's snapchat she did the other
day it was like talking about how a lot
of people were trying to tell her
I missed old Jacqueline ones old
Jacqueline coming back and I hate this
new Jacqueline and all this
basically was and Jacqueline
put one on snapchat was like you know
what like that old Jacqueline was
suicidal and depressed and I know you
guys maybe you guys miss her maybe you
guys don't but I'm so happy she's gone
and that's exactly how I feel - I wasn't
suicidal necessarily I was definitely
depressed you know coming out growing up
Mormon it was really hard for me you
know now I've just come into my own and
I'm so much happier with my life right
now I don't know I'll never let anyone
take that away from me you know I'll
never let anyone take that away from me
I don't care what anyone says I don't
care if you hate me I don't care if you
think I'm the worst person in the entire
world you think I'm an evil vindictive
bitch or do you think I'm what you
whatever you may think like if you're a
hater that's watching this whatever you
may think about me like I literally
don't give a single because I'm so
happy with my life you know I'm so happy
with how things are going I'm so happy
with differentials I have I'm so happy
with like my followers I'm so happy my
family and I don't care what anyone says
you know because what people say doesn't
matter how you feel is what matters if
you guys don't take anything for my
channel what everyone says like
 what everyone says dude you know
what I mean like a lot of people always
ask me like about advice and they're
like so what kind of advice you'd give
me if I'm starting out YouTube or I'm in
high school right now and I'm struggling
you know and it's so hard because I was
there you know I was so there it was
rough me too you know like I didn't have
it easy growing up a lot people try to
make it seem like oh my god my life I'm
a youtuber now so I like automatically
successful it's like no you don't
understand like I worked so hard to get
where I am right now I'm emotionally
much more stable than I was mentally I'm
much more stable you know I have
problems I have so many problems I get
asked a lot like Manny how do you say
strong with big on social media because
it's such an ugly place for being a
beauty world it's such an ugly vile
place and I'll have to ask you like how
do you stay strong and how do you
continue to do it and it's like you know
what I'm so okay with myself
I'm so happy where with where my life is
right now that really no one and nothing
can bring me down yeah I get upset
sometimes in the I cop back and that's
just cause like I'm a human and I have
human feelings and I will get mad and
pissed off sometimes but it really
doesn't matter you know what I mean like
I said earlier like when I watched that
one movie miracles
man if you guys ever want to watch a
movie that simple I can just into
perspective try watching miracles from
Atman it was just such a sick ass movie
and it was so nice to watch and I was
like you know what like my life's
fantastic yeah I might get pissed online
and I might get hate every single day
but the amount of love I get is so much
more powerful and my family's healthy
I'm healthy yeah I have problems but I'm
healthy you know what I mean and the
people I care about are healthy and
that's why barriers like all these
gossip channels and all these people
talking about me and they're just
so much like nastiness in the world that
I literally like whatever like I
literally don't even care anymore I used
to care a lot more and I just learned to
like you know what people are gonna do
what people want to do and you can't
change that you know if people so if
someone doesn't like you they don't like
you and that's just what it is I'm not
gonna try my hardest to change their
mind cuz it's not my problem anymore
it's theirs so if you're in high school
or something and you're having problems
and someone doesn't like you or
someone's treating you a bad way it's on
them it is on them do not even worry
about it
because you're gonna get past high
school you're gonna get past your
struggles whatever you're dealing with
at this time and it's gonna get so much
better on to a much more pleasant topic
other than going to Bora Bora and
everything was so freaking phenomenal I
went to London London was so amazing
guys like I can't even explain it I
cannot wait to go back I'm going back
next year I'm going back you guys it was
so lit ah this is called lit and
I was actually really lucky enough to
take my mom with me oh my gosh it's so
much fun I went with beautybay which is

go with Jeffery Patrick it was such a
cool just fun a strip and being the in
London like is so crazy like it was so

cool it was everything about it is so
awesome and everyone was so nice I
decided to browse off-camera I wasn't

kind of just tossed on tell me like a
minute it's one of those days it's one
of those days okay eyes are prime that's

prayer and what I am so yeah guys so
after I went to London we took straight
from London

Mac me and Patrick den and it was so
much fun to all the New Yorkers out
there that came out to meet me Patrick

start to work with influencers a lot
more I went to Corpus Christi with Mac
for the Selena event and it was so much
fun it was crazy it was so crazy the
people incorporate us you guys they are
diehard like I don't think I've ever
seen love like I've seen it in Texas

in Texas they just love so hard and so
much and it's just so cool to see
chocolate-brown right there yeah so it
was super super fun and it was so nice
and I'm so happy like that Mac even
chose me and Patrick to do am angry with
it was so crazy you know it's full
circle for me I worked at Mac I was a
freelancer I was trying to become
permanent and I didn't become permanent
so then I started to really throw myself
into social media and doing social media
full-time and I just decided that that
was gonna be a better route for me you
know because I wasn't becoming permanent
I interview twice didn't get the spots
and I was like man I'm so over this
you know I'm a firm believer in things
happen for a reason and I was not meant
to get permanent iMac you know I was
meant to like do other things more vx
kathleenlights taking some of this
palette up in this bitch too because I
have too many damn onion pretty I'm so
proud of you Kathleen if you see this
was so proud of you this palette is so
beautiful I haven't got to really play
with it yet but this emerald green is
calling to me I kind of want to put on
me Lynn oh it feels great you Don the
brush oh holy
Kathleen you are not playing any games
up
holy I love and I'm pleasantly surprised
like this where it's like holy shiny to
blend eyes blinding own without my
cheeks I'm put that right over my
cheekbone I think right now hold on got
it okay cool it's like that oh it's like
some glitter glue from two-faced and put
some glitter on my lids too might as
well we're gonna take it there Mac
reflex transparent teal on the lid with
Kathleen shadow has a base it's so like
how gnarly that is that's epic
that is blinding whoa whoa whoa I really
hope this pallet comes back because
this is good it was really funny another
randoms I know I the other day nothing
day it was like maybe weeks it was
couple weeks ago made a joke on one of
my videos the full-face affordable
tutorial that's the video was and I made
a joke about morphe how I was like oh
maybe if you didn't talk so much in like
learned how to do makeup kind of thing
of some it was something along those
lines I was poking fun at the
talking youtubers who should talk about
morphe who don't know how to makeup I
got blown like way way way out of
proportion like you were like oh my god
that was so so rude I can't believe you
said that like that's not even funny I
don't want to do makeup like that's
really offensive and I'm like so the
entire video I you watched me joking
about specifically about talking
youtubers who make videos against morphe
you're taking offense to that cutting
out of the entire video you want to take
that one thing and take offense okay
god no I was making sure that that's
what it was you know I want to make sure
the thing about people taking offense to
things is that they choose to take
offense to it if you want to be the type
of person that wants to take offense to
every little thing that people say
that's fine that's a shitty ass way to
live I'm just saying that sucks for you
to like consoling just be listening to
things to get offended about that
 sucks man I can't even imagine
living my life like that like wanting to
be offended by things brother
uh-huh there's so many worse things in
the world so many more things to be said
if you really want take offense to that
that's fine that's that's fine but
what's the point like why are you taking
offense to it I don't know it's just so
funny to me
makeup is makeup it comes off at the end
of the day it's not supposed to be
taking that seriously it's fun it's so
fun why you taking it so
like offensive what the what but hey I
don't know I'm not a freakin
talking youtuber I don't make videos
again bashing brands I don't know I can
answer for them guys I just I'm just
going to continue to do me and if you
like me amazing I'm so happy and I'm so
happy that we can make this connection
with each other and if you don't then I
really don't care what can I be calm
eyelashes real quick and put some
mascara on and put some lashes on right
okay guys I just tossed on some lashes
really quickly iPod some Bellas buy new
bounce some you guys already know
Bella's are like my absolute obsession
another lash that's very similar is Lily
lashes Mykonos they're basically the
exact same style
I know it's another popular pair from me
Lily but yeah either way Bella is out of
stock go to Lily
if vice versa they're both amazing IVA
code with both of them mani Mui will
save you some money if you want to save
do not it's all good this is the last
pair I like to wear I'm thinking of
taking Jeffery stars leo lipstick I
haven't worn I have once oh my god I
feel like this is gonna go really pretty
with this look mmm that's really nice oh
yeah
and the last thing I just did guys was
generation Beauty San Francisco another
