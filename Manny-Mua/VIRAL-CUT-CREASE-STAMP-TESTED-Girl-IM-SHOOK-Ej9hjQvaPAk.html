today's video I am so excited about
today's video because I feel like it has
been some time coming I have been
wanting to film with this for so freakin
long so basically all over the place
there has been this viral cut crease dam
that is just like so cute looks like a
little like has a little puff ball to
end of it's a very very very unique
looking I'm actually gonna show you guys
it looks like right here look at this
it's magic so basically what it is will
be eight a perfect cut crease and you
just cut your crease with this
bitch so basically this was a super
viral product a little while ago and I'd
try to get my hands on it and I could
not find it literally anywhere and I
believe the owner of this or the creator
of this I believe his name is Jack and
Noguera yeah nowhere nowhere yet I can't
speak say me Jack Noguera makeup on
Instagram and he has about 70,000
followers and he's super super cool he's
very very amazing and I think that he's
basically the one that created this cut
crease stamp I actually had no ideas
what's called ah I just came to the
realization and I might have bought a
fake one it's supposed to look like this
like in that case a mine came in this
why the are these face getting so
 good is what I would like to
know
they look pretty similar and the
thing is I could not find this literally
anywhere because he I think lives in
like in Brazil or something so I had no
idea how to get ahold of this at all and
I had tried to buy it couldn't buy it
was sold out didn't you know what site
to go to to buy it to get it sent to the
US had no idea and I finally had
searched crease that virally and I found
this site that had it and I thought this
is it I thought this is correct you're
gonna fake one I think the premise of
the whole thing still it's like the same
thing it's the same shape the same build
the same size about it's basically the
same thing but a fake cheaper version of
it because it says that this thing is a
hundred something dollars and no my was
like ten dollars
- from who I D Beauty when I was like
trying to be like Hooda Beauty look I
bought a baked I'm still gonna try it
out cuz that they wanted to try this
 for a long time and at least we
can take it from the grain of salt that
it's not the original product so if it
doesn't work as good we know that it's a
fake this time that is great to know
because all the videos from like the
real one look absolutely amazing so I
wanted to try it so much so we're gonna
try it out anyway even though it is I
guess a fake product that's suck so I'm
really
anyway that's what it was going to be as
always your guys talking this video you
guys do not like me please don't
watch it you know the drill with that
you don't need watch my videos if you
don't like me why I watch a bitch you
don't like but there is that the
concept of hate watching which is which
can be fun too and so if your hate
watching me
once a bitch anyway by do you guys do
like this video please go and click like
and subscribe to our channel if you're
not already in for new what's up in many
anyway and welcome to my channel thank
you so much for being here
I really appreciate it yeah I'm gonna
going to get right into this testing
this viral video
I feel so funny like a pear basically
first of course we have to have some
eyeshadow on and so with today I'm gonna
be using the Laura Lee Los Angeles nudie
patootie palette as my eye shadows only
this one on sale this week so
excited for or maybe last week I don't
know when this video is actually
technically going up but I'm going to
her event tonight so I thought I'd be
perfect to film with this and use miss
nudie patootie this is the most
beautiful ass neutral palette girl if
you're into neutrals which many of you
are many of you are this is the one
we're gonna do a normal casual crease
we're gonna take which we take in here
undressed and this is gonna be going on
a morphine m50 for large crease brush
with into the crease I'm gonna start to
build up our crease colors because we're
gonna do like a half-cup crease like
that like the little videos suggest or
like I've seen this color I would say
take a heart it's like a khaki this
color is a good khaki shade it's a kind
of hard to describe to be on it has like
a little bit of yellow undertone and a
slit almost good green undertone as well
super super pretty
more of an unique shade for sure don't
take strip we're gonna put a couple into
the crease just I can sort of build up
some intensity so we can actually really
cut it out and see the contrast between
the crease and the stamp oh why am i
nervous I think it's because I know it's
a fake I'm nervous I really shouldn't be
filming this video because it's fake I
really shouldn't be giving in to that
bitch no cool right Alex you
know the original is and I'll be linking
original they do to bitch they
really got me I had no idea was faking
to I just looked it up right now and
researched it I just bought it thinking
look I finally found it cuz I've been
trying to find it for so long I think
that if the fake works we're gonna know
that the real one works I think it's
still for research purposes it's just
still for the research purposes
or take the shade button akin to a
chocolatey beautiful brown so to build
up that color
this makeup has to turn out pretty you
guys because I'm watching today after
this so if it doesn't work PSD shadows
are amazing as we're all aware Laura Lee
did that Laura Lee did a
that levers the match okay now we're
getting we're getting somewhere we're
getting somewhere was trying to build up
the color so we built it up we have some
good deepness into the grease we're
actually going on they look mmm
okay guys so basically wanna do now is
I'm gonna do our local crews oh I'm
nervous I'm excited I'm gonna be taking
tart shape tape that's what he
recommends I saw on his Instagram he
uses that means my doing it left first
I'm gonna take this side and I'm gonna
paint her like one of my French cows no
I'm gonna take half tart shape tape on
the side of here half of it but really
saturate the brush or applicator
it's adorable it's uh bearable the
moment of truth the moment of truth zoom
in the camera a little bit for you guys
to see a little bit better tart shape
davis on that i daunting
I'm daunted I'm scared don't up I
was gonna tell him I head back against
I'm gonna hold it there oh my goodness
hey I'm like I totally would have worked
if I wipe the sides off idiot
huh what the bug dude if I had the real
one that probably would have happened
okay but holy that work holy
okay now we're just gonna take my little
concealer brush I usually use for like
my brow and I'm gonna blend the edges of
it do our little half cut crease and
just to make sure everything looks clean
but that totally work oh my god
also the real one I noticed that comes
with more sizes so that's already a
reason to use the real one given
the fake one word why am I so shook at
this I don't know I just made it so much
easier
like actually living a Thousand Eyes
right now the crease go up a little high
it did a little high oh good and now
let's go ahead and up
why some like glitter or something you
know it's so annoying that I like got a
fake one because it keeps popping off I
need to see we glue it I'll be mine
we're gonna take actually we take one of
the board's little glitters we're take
j-bird we're gonna rub that all over I'm
just packing on the shadow j-bird oh
 wait too exciting I don't know why
I look so excited about this I apologize
look up he went to lure shadows all
right what the go Laura Lee go
Laura Lee that's my man hanging
around here and if it doesn't work with
the shadows we can just use an actual
glitter and we should be okay so let's
go and try it with this we did a half
I'm gonna take a shadow
yeah work bro no whether not
whether I'm actually more excited about
this I thought I was gonna be going
again like are you serious of fill it in
a little bit with my own like finger
I'll do that well you're on the side
what girl just a little tap tap tap I
love it
now we do the other side with this
happened see how this dam works and
let's see honest you guys this could be
a really cool thing for a lot of you
guys who are I do a cut crease we don't
really know how to achieve it this could
be like a really cool thing
no I'm Shane it's a little bit messy I'm
not gonna lie other side next the right
side this would be so much easier if you
did on someone else by the way this
would be a ten times easy if you did on
someone else but it's only me in this
house right now and if Nicholas here I
had make him do it but we don't got Nick
right now
eating see she would make mom I
was napping okay that one was a little
more floppy I'm not gonna lie honestly
you don't have to press it that hard I
think I was pressing it too hard still
worked pretty good like honestly
if I might have used too much concealer
very possible I'm still gagged that this
even worked like honestly I'm gagged
it's not like perfect perfect it wasn't
as good as I did on this side but it
looks pretty good at meeting my little
conceited but if I can clean this on up
I will say that this made it a lot
faster is it having to go H by H and
like kind of touch it out like that
looks pretty good I'm not even
 do to me hey you got the deep
voice coming out because I'm excited
glitter time okay next one we have
j-bird on this right here we have j-bird
on oh that's a beautiful Cudi
it just it just works wrong you
do it again I'm doing it again look at
that look at that and now I just take
the rest of j-bird I just put it
basically with my finger in the areas I
don't really need to be as like
concentrated in like just more freely
like this work and honestly not
to sound like a bitch by expected not to
work because I know I tend to be pretty
skeptical about these things yeah Oh
like I'm always kind of like no you're
gonna work or no but this totally works
you guys so what do we think of Ty's
video do we think that this work do we
think of the product of things that it
was a yes or no honestly I'm gonna say
this was like yes I really wish I had
bought the real one or 100% I really
wish I did I'd know I did I didn't even
bought the fake one like these fakes out
here are getting too real like they look
too good buuuut is me it's not fair
honestly I thought it worked
fantastically I'm sure the original one
would have worked even better than this
did but it looks so cool I think it
actually was so much easier to use it I
thought it was gonna be it takes a
little bit more time when it comes to
like actually like applying stuff onto
it putting onto your eye and like making
sure that you like put it onto the right
spot it's a little bit harder to do on
yourself I've been on someone else would
be so much easier but honestly it turned
out so cool and I would
recommend it anyways guys that's it for
today's video and I'm honestly blown
away I want to get the real one that I
was like adjustable sizes and things
like that
huge shout out to Jack or even creating
this product honestly it's so innovative
and it's so unique and so different and
honestly I really really really liked it
I think you did an amazing job and I
think that people would be so happy to
use this it's actually so practical and
it works fantastically and go.you that's
amazing you already have people like
trying to dupe you that's saying
something I mean I got duped I
had no idea that this wasn't yours thank
you guys so much for watching I had an
amazing time doing this I'm gonna leave
the original creator of this thing down
below in his sights to see if you guys
