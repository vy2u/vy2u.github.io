what is up you guys I am man your way if
you guys are not familiar what is up
there was like this viral video going
around on Facebook and on Twitter and I
got tagged so much to try these quick
cats eyeliner strips literally it's
basically eyeliner tape but that was the
vibe I was getting from the little
videos of that it's literally like
eyeliner on tape and you like put it
down and you like peel it off and it's
like so I really really really haven't
really wanted to try it out and finally
got them in an email and I'm so stoked
are they a hit or miss like what is the
T about these quick cat eyeliner strips
so we're going to do that today we're
going to do a review and demo on this
product so if you guys want to see that
video keep on watching as always for
guys do not like this video if you guys
do not like me please don't
watch it you know Joe is that but if you
guys do like the video please go ahead
and subscribe to my channel if you're
not already subscribed and thank you so
much for being here if you are a
subscriber of mine but yeah let's go
ahead get started on today's review on
these quick cat eyeliner strips tapes I
mean honestly this can make our eyeliner
game easier I'm game
so okay so went ahead and went on the
page right now for the quick eyeliner
strips so I just wanted to talk about
really quickly this is what it looks
like it comes with 32 strips 16 for the
left 16 for the right and it comes with
an eye liner in it any retails for 995
which i think is a really great price
point even for just like the eyeliner
alone 995 is like really good currently
it's on pre-order how things are
available just yet you guys can go ahead
like the one I just read was the refill
pack and then I found the other one
that's eyeliners chest pack 32 pen
included free shipping for 1195 so
there's like two different ones on the
site but they contain the same thing
let's just with the let's just read the
instructions on how to doing our
tank but before I even start honestly
when I first saw a video going viral I
100,000% thought it was literally tape
that has eyeliner on it like already
eyeliner like free on it I don't know
how I was literally think I'm like how
the did they do this
it's literally like eyeliner tape that
you like just stick on and you're like
Remy remove and it's like eyeliner I was
like gum as I'm reading this right now
that's not the case I totally thought
that was let's just open this
bitch okay if you have like an you have
an instructions we have instructions
right here so we have a this is this is
the gagra here this is what
I mean this is without Mischa you apply
the quick hat liquid eyeliner liberally
to Zone two on sticky side distribute
ink evenly so basically you're using an
eyeliner on a spot on the tape and then
the tape is like the transfer you're
putting eyeliner on a piece of tape and
eye but they make it easier for you
because it's like outlined perfectly I
don't know we're gonna go ahead and dive
right in what I decided to do I wanted
to do half me like not have my face but
like this area I want to put like a
foundation on cuz I know a lot of people
do their eye makeup after their base I'm
one included so I wanted to do a little
bit of my base here one one out just to
see like that makes a difference or if
like using it with the base down first
if I'm peeling if I'm like putting this
tape down will it take off all my
 makeup I'm like that's not the
look that we're going for you know I'm
saying we're gonna go ahead and try to
put some foundation on really quickly on
this face this face is rough too
that you guys she's really going through
something
flem's gonna put a little bit of my NARS
radiant long wearing foundation anyways
because either on what I will we're
going set this area okay cool
so we have half the face with foundation
on with concealer foundation it's set in
place so we're gonna go ahead and see
how the eyeliner sticks onto something
that's primed and ready to go with
foundation on and another side we're
gonna do on completely bare skin and see
how it goes on maybe goes on better
maybe goes on worse so we're going to go
ahead and go right in this is actually
what a strip looks like right here
sorry that's taking me so long to even
show you guys this is what the strip
looks like right here so literally it's
just like a little tiny strip of tape
and there's different sections there's
like a one two three and four section
the back of it so what it says the rear
read instructions realtor Lee this is
for the left wing so this is for this
side slowly move remove backing shade in
Zone two on sticky side so it's
basically saying to remove like this and
we're gonna remove the tape boom now
peel zone three apart from clear
transfer layer okay okay I'm seeing
right here peel the second strip stick
bottom edge of strip alongside our edge
of a book we know I did it wrong because
I feel like this is supposed to be
filled in like this is not supposed to
be here okay guys I think I did this
completely
wrong and we're gonna have to start over
with the city I think what I
suppose I suppose I'll leave this on
like this and then filled in because
look I'm like see then you remove this
little part right there so we're gonna
this one more time you ever tried a
couple more times we actually if I can
get you like I'm not stopping until get
this correctly let's try the right wing
ha maybe my left is being gay I
feel like this is like the back part
here remove wax backing from check
remove wax this is the wax back hand
could be late its waxy place strip
sticky side up on the scratch pad below
apply it
okay okay okay maybe you like I I think
I went too quick I think I always too
crazy I'm saying so I think what I do is
I apply the eyeliner to this little part
right here
just see okay I'm he doesn't see but
there's like that little black part of
that little indent right there you play
there so we're gonna take our little
eyeliner we're gonna apply it to the
back of this liberally they say
liberally taking a little highly know
that I came with I really saturated it
like hardcore did a time now we
remove again okay now I think I'm
getting oh my gosh I think I'm getting
it okay the eyeliner itself when we
swatching it is sickening that is black
is the night sky no I think I up
again but I'm not gonna stick this to my
eye
are you kidding this is a almost a joke
at this point I messed up twice in
different ways okay I know removed the
wax that or I know I know like the back
of my hand you remove the wax and put a
pop of I'm loving it you know okay we
got here wax strip removed so I'm gonna
do now I'm gonna do the same thing I'm
gonna cover it in black damn I think I'm
wasting a lot of eyeliner with this now
that I separated the back I'm gonna
remove the white strip right here go
more I see
okay okay okay okay
oh my gosh oh my gosh okay huh we have
something we have something here Eileen
here okay we finally got somewhere you
guys okay I'm so excited
holy it took me a minute but we got
there I moved the mirror closer so I'm
scared I want to up the authority
but the back yeah okay we have our right
Eileen there dick to the base it's hey
dick to the base of the eye really make
sure it's saturated we have it on Oh
feels weird it feels halo and carefully
peel away from eyelid awake my lid from
center outwards to reveal the perfect
cat eye Wayne
fill in areas lacking saturation okay
I'm not giving up on this yet okay we
have a flick at least we're gonna do the
left with makeup on
honestly the right was kind of a flop so
far so we're gonna try the left so we're
gonna do it correctly this time like I
now I know the zones okay so now
we're gonna do we remove the wax strip
first this takes a long time for someone
that wants to do a quick eyeliner yeah
so now I'm gonna take the eyeliner and
this Islander guys like I said earlier
what i'm swatching it it is so
pigmented like it's a very very intense
this time I'm really over saturating it
because it didn't come off that much in
the first one on my right side and this
bit just flooded if it doesn't transfer
with this it will not transfer and I'm
gonna be upset we're gonna go ahead and
try it and putting it on with foundation
and everything
uh-huh press it in also a lot of fun you
can come off with this one it worked
better on that side I'm doing everything
correct I don't know what's going on
like I really don't we're gonna try the
right side one more time I've literally
wasted already like I think six strips
trying to figure this bitch out oh my
god I'm gonna use a different eyeliner
I'm not gonna use a quick high one I'm
gonna use the Kat Von D yeah maybe that
will make a difference I'm gonna use the
Kat Von D eyeliner the one I use like
literally all the time I'm gonna try one
more time and honestly this is a flop
and I have my verdict I know what I feel
about this and that's final and that's
 final look at my eye wax removed
boom I'm getting so much better at this
tattoo liner by Kat Von D and we're
gonna see if that makes a difference
because the first one is not my favorite
okay
annoying thing about this is I feel like
you're wasting a lot of eyeliner when
doing this that's nothing something you
have to note let's go ahead and do it
the right way you will really member now
we're really pressing with him
I mean that was better than the clique
at one what is this look what I can
just like this boom boom boom boom boom
boom that's so much easier okay guys
that is ever today's video what do I
think about these quick eyeliner strips
honestly I guess technically for me like
the proof is in the pudding I literally
tried doing it several times we got to a
point that I just couldn't do it anymore
the one with foundation and primed came
off better the one without just wanted
to note that out this I just did myself
a quick little one - it just did not
work for me and I really wanted it to
because the videos look so promising and
so good maybe for using a different form
of eyeliner maybe using a gel eyeliner
maybe using something else to fill it in
but it does not work with what it came
with which is the whole point of this
video I wanted to show using the actual
quick cat eyeliner itself also when
looking at it or here feel so shiny this
black eyeliner is it is shiny means
really black but it looks silver with
the cops running it is it did not work
with that one it just wouldn't work on
me I don't know maybe my eyes repelled
it I don't know anyway I guess all in
all I would say for me this was a Miss
sadly I really really wanted at work I
had like high hopes for it you know I've
tried to go into these videos with like
a open mind I try not to be too negative
about them even though I feel like
sometimes they're gonna be gimmicky I'm
like you know what it's gonna be cool
it'll work but sometimes it doesn't work
out like that and this is one of the
products for me it just did not work out
they're not too expensive which is great
like twelve bucks or nine bucks to the
refills and like ten bucks for the
eyeliner itself which is really really
cool but I think that for me I would
pass I wouldn't buy it myself only
because I just there's no significant
thing that it didn't work for me enough
where I was like you're doing too much
work for not enough payoff just from my
 frame of mind please just let me
have this I'm going to do a gel eyeliner
on my hand let's not get crazy I'm gonna
do it on my hand and see how the
transfer on the hand is but gel eyeliner
on this now we're gonna go ahead and see
this one I know it's gonna work like I
just feel it in my bones jaw liner it
takes forever to dry I just feel it's
gonna work on this one okay over here
we're applying it pressure pressure what
is going to happen I don't know
ah so much better I told you
guys I felt at my bone we're
gonna do it on the left I'm taking the
Inglot gel liner by the way guess you
all right
okay run try the left side again guys
we're tight left side one more time and
of course it's already a diner there but
now we're at the point where we already
know it's gonna be more pigmented so
let's just try it thank you guys for
bearing with me I want to do a real good
review the problem with the gel liner is
like when you're pressing it in it gets
everywhere because it's a gel so any
little movement is going to move it a
lot I mean it's definitely better it's
not good enough that's my problem is
that's not good enough yeah you guys got
the verdict still doesn't really work I
would say definitely works a lot more
with gel liner it definitely did great
on my hand and it's a lot easier to fill
this in but the problem is that it is
not the most user-friendly thing I would
say just a stick to do it I normally if
you guys can if you can't then this
might be a great thing for you to like
as a resource to help guide you when
doing a winged liner using gel liner of
course I wouldn't really recommend doing
a liquid liner because it did not work
and never transfer like literally ever
barely transferred like a dot so
yeah that's my opinion that's my
thoughts on this product hope you guys
enjoyed it and as always have a great
show tonight or date wherever you guys
heart and I will catch you guys in my
next video bye guys I love you what so
what's up you guys welcome back to my
channel today is wait anything remove
the wax backing from the strip place
ship side oh there's like a lot of
things gonna run it okay I walked up and
I'm like oh hi I need powder I'm oily
yep are they going to leave it that's
when he gets to know them I cannot
believe that math of like waste that
comes from this that you get three
strips from one strip</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
