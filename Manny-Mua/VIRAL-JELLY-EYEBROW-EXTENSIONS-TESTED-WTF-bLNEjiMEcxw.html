so it tastes video I am so fucking
excited to be filming with this because
I have been looking for this fucking
product for so long actually ever since
I saw it on vogue Korea's Instagram I
was like a viral video of this guy this
is the really brow extensions like gel
ting of gel brow extension I've been
looking for it non-stop and finally
finally by the grace of all that is good
and holy in the second world I found it
on this one website that sells like
Korean makeup and things like that so I
will link that website down below if you
guys aren't interested in trying it out
for yourselves I think I bought it for
$25 u.s. but my shipping was like $25 as
well so I was like oh fuck a brow jelly
that's an eyebrow extension to have
little hairs in it which is fucking
weird I don't really have the thinnest
eyebrows don't get me wrong I do not
have thin eyebrows but they're
definitely there's definitely sparseness
I like this weird things on my brows
were like the edges right here like
there's like a weird divot weird divot I
don't know like why it's like that like
I said earlier there was a viral clip
going around Oliver Twitter I had so
many people asking me on Twitter and on
Instagram to try out the brow extension
brow gel it was a bitch to find it
really truly truly was but I'm like you
know what fuck it I found it I'm very
excited to try it out I'm gonna step one
step two and literally laying and
Cantigny I can't read that but anyway
let's go ahead and get into today's
video as always if you guys do not like
this video because do not like me please
don't fucking watch it you know under
what bank but if you guys that do like
this video please subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and if
you're new what's up I'm an emu a and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here I really really
appreciate it
um but anyway let's go and get in to
this testing this jelly eyebrow
extension jelly it's so fucking weird
I'm very excited about this how many
guys understand I'm here
we 3d fiber I browse okay so I'm
assuming it's actually made out of fiber
I would love to read the instructions to
you guys or like what it's about like
the details on this but there's nowhere
in here that says anything in English so
hey use at your own discretion all it
says is easy to wash off with warm water
long lasting water was easy wash off
with warm water right next to it water
resistant so this is a package right
here guys this is what it comes in this
is what it looks like so when we take
the bad bitch out and we have this guy
it looks so we're gonna do we're gonna
pop the little back bitch off and it
comes with a little brow like little
brush spoolie it's a really shitty brush
I'm not gonna lie just feeling it right
now it's not very good I wish it was
angled now to meet obviously a lot more
sense
but whatever yeah so this is what it
looks like on the inside it literally is
like little fucking hairs I turn down
the brightness a little bit so you can
see what I'm talking about there's
literal like eyebrow hairs in the cap
you can you see that shit
that's mad nasty looking so let's go
ahead and I just want to put a little
bit on my hand so we can see exactly
what it looks like going on to the hand
and the consistency so dipping into it
right here or dipping in it's basically
feels like glue so have someone picked
up on here I want to see what it
deposits like you're here Oh tell me
that does not look like a fucking chunk
of cat hair where's my hand so I think
you're here we literally put on and it
distributes micro pieces of hair on the
brow on the skin so technically the gel
inside is completely clear and the brows
is what's making it look very very black
because the brow hairs are black so that
black jelly the jelly itself is
completely clear it's the black hairs
that make it look dark if you guys so
we're gonna go and try this honestly I
don't know why I'm like really weirded
out to try this like I don't I don't
know like I
want to try it I really don't it just
look so host we're going to go right the
fuck in whoo
we're going in yeah I want to go ahead
and start applying this gel to the brows
to make them thicker okay so as we are
putting it on it's like very very
intensely wet
okay um so far it's going on I mean it's
going on but it's so fucking wet like
that it looks like it's painting down my
eyebrows do I see that I'm trying to
attach the actual little hairs to my
real hair so we are brushing them
through mm mm okay so I mean obviously
it's depositing the little hairs but it
is so goopy and gooey that I'm like
bitch is it even gonna like dry down
like the fuck oh my gosh it dry it off
my hand away it dried bitch so as you
can see I placed a bunch of little hairs
down honestly the problem with this is
that it is looking so fucking wet and
when it dries it's more dry down like a
fucking intense ass glue looking bitch
and I'm like do we want that do we want
that you know I mean it works there's
definitely little hair fibers getting
put down but I like my other brow more
like it looks it's better it looks
fucking fuller which is weird something
I don't know I don't know I'm gonna go
do my other brow off-camera and let the
side dry and then we'll see what we
think okay guys so I let this dry down
for about 10 minutes
we are officially like it's dry
completely on my brow honestly we have
the verdicts we are done we have the
verdict done I know what I think about
this I know whether or not to hit or
miss I know whether or not how we'll use
it again I think that this bad bitch
hear me and my brows look thinner is
anything where before so the problem
with this product here is that the gel
is so strong it's literally like glue
it's like gluing down your brows with
fucking gel I'm not even kidding you
like it's flat to my fucking skin that
shit is wild so that happens right so
that makes your brow look wet and the
mixture of brow your actual real brow
hairs combined together to be like a
thing so they become like a one little
unit instead of like being multiple
fluffy brow hairs you can see that there
is hairs of course deposited there's
like little random hairs out there over
here over here little random hairs out
here peeking through there's
my hairs that get put down but do the
fact that the glue is so fucking strong
and there's no point like it literally
makes it looked in all over again if not
thinner than the brow looked before so
for me this was a full dam I honestly
had like high hopes for I'm not gonna
lie I had high hopes but I know I'll
never use it again like look hope watch
she and patchy my brows look there's
literally like rock-hard
the whole thing's a mess it's a mess it
really ain't so yeah you guys have done
it for today's video
all in all what do I think about the
really eyebrow brow extensions
hit-or-miss
i would say that this is more of a Miss
for me due to the fact that the glue is
a way too strong it's way too prominent
it literally makes my browser glue down
like a fucking glue stick like a drag
fucking stick down so I would say save
your money that was a $50 spend I really
did not need to spend I could not spend
that money and imperfectly fine but all
in all this is not worth the money is
not what the prices is a complete miss
for me I'm bummed this I really really
wanted to work and it does look really
really cool on the hand like if you were
to make like a little brow thing it
looks fucking cool as fuck but literally
when it's that strong of the glue like
what's the point of it
what's the point but I do have 2 min to
like I don't have no brows like there's
definitely brows down so if you have no
brow hair and you just want to look like
little random hairs all over your skin
maybe that would work better I really
have no idea I technically do have brows
so I have no fucking clue like not a
clue in the world so anyway that is
different video guys hope you guys had
fun watching had so much fun creating it
for you guys now I need to fix these
fucking brows I can film another video
after huh but anyway I love you guys so
much and I'll see you guys in my next
