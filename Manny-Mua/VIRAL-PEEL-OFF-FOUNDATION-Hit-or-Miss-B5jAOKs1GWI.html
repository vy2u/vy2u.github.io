it's been a fucking minute since I had
filmed a video I've been gone I was in
Bora Bora and right now when this is
uploading I'm probably gonna be in Fiji
I've been traveling so much in the month
of August I'm basically home for a week
and then in September I'm also traveling
a lot because I'm doing drag con with
Jeffery and Laura we're doing a meeting
view together and a panel together and
then I'm there for a week for Fashion
Week I believe so it's gonna be a hectic
ass month so today's video is going to
be a review of video I do apologize if
I'm doing a lot of review because
recently
I'm only here in LA for two days between
my Bora Bora and VG trip and it's
basically all I can really really really
accomplish in the time frame that I have
I can't really do full get writers with
me like full-day videos right now so I
need to be able to pre film like two to
three in one day to be able to still be
able to have content for you guys two
times a week it's really really really
really hard and I hope you guys do
appreciate the fact that I kill myself
to get these videos up for you guys but
I really you know act like I want to you
guys you know I feel like I owe the
content to you guys I am a youtuber I am
a youtuber first and I'm so grateful for
them but it doesn't mean I can't put up
content for you guys so uh that's why I
do it
so today's video what are we doing what
is what is the review today guys we are
going to be testing the farmer maker
Dyer sk's di re si s il dire Sol
faceshield
we'll figure that out as we go along
with the video but yeah you guys that
today's video is going to be we're gonna
be testing out this peel-off foundation
is also put it as your base then you pay
foundation on top and it becomes like a
sealant I don't know how it works really
but yeah you guys have you guys enjoyed
today's video as always if you guys
don't like this video if you guys do not
like me please don't fucking watch it
you know the drill with that but you
guys do like this video please subscribe
to my channel if you're not already and
if you knew what's up a man um your way
and welcome back to my channel let's get
into this face shield peel-off
foundation
okay so let's go ahead and start on
today's video so let's going to read
what this bad bitch is is what it looks
like and took a little box
it's very Korean I was gonna call it
face shield instead of Darcelle aware of
the fuck facial can help reduce the
amount of casual sebum produced by your
skin and refresh your tired skin made in
Korea okay and if it looks like right
here it's like a cool little cute to be
it has ten milliliters or 0.33 fluid
ounces and it's basically a shield patch
that soft skin problems we're gonna this
big job so I bought this product on
Amazon for $15 and it was free shipping
so I got for 15 bucks
so basically it says once the patch is
firm you can apply makeup on top of it
it's supposed to be a protective film
over the face put it over all the areas
that are porous areas that are more oily
things like that so that's what we're
gonna do guys hmmm smells like nothing
we're safe too clear viscous fluid right
there yeah this much and we're gonna put
it on the skin oh this feels fucking
weird Oh ciao woah cha ha it's cold all
over this skin we're gonna put a pretty
thin relatively thin layer nothing too
intense oh my god guys if you're so
fucking weird I'm gonna put on the areas
I have the most intense pores and all my
smile lines because we need to be able
to see if it's gonna crack and you guys
I have acne going on right now because
uh I have been in Bora Bora and I've
been using sunscreen every single day
all day and it just been clogging my
pores up and there no RAF okay looks
like an oil slick I'm not really sure I
don't really like the way it feels it's
a very very very heavy feeling liquid
it's not a lightweight thing by any
means it feels like a mask so we're
gonna let this dry down and see we're
gonna put some foundation on top of it
and see how it looks and see if it looks
good is it gonna make our skin look more
pretty it's gonna look more poreless it
smells weird
definitely so I'm like chatting with
this dude on Instagram and like just
casually just chatting on DM like hey
dude what's up how are you kind of thing
he's a really handsome guy and right now
he's like I'm trying to get into YouTube
would you if I post a tweet will you
retweet it
just feel like people trying to hit me
up or right like they only talk to me
because they think they can get
something from me
and it really really gets on my nerves
nah man no no I don't play and see what
I'm gonna say back that's see I'm not I
don't know you like that okay guys we're
almost drying we are almost dry even
though we're so he's looking suck that
doesn't look like a little bit drier I
think we look fucking good fucking donut
okay guys we are now dry on the face
everything is dry I'm gonna take some of
my fears foundation this is the coat
Gendo foundation aqua foundation and a
trusty ramona sponge we're gonna go on
top I got more tan in bora-bora guys um
which is shocking like you would never
think I would get more tan so this is
actually like a little life for me
shocking love you can see like my
vitiligo is much more prominent right
now hey if you're new I'm an emu a I
have vitiligo
just random sign no but you can see much
more intensely because I'm darker okay
we're gonna put it on the skin okay so
I'm lightly patting on the skin I can
normally would and I see areas like on
the like the corners of my face or here
they are starting to lift already and
the foundation is not even fucking dry
yet another one I would close and
personal look at the pores right here do
you see this bullshit right there right
here hella fucking broken up intense as
fuck pores again okay so that's a flop
so far when I wrinkle my forehead you
can see this like weird little like film
of like almost like a plastic bag ah
fuck me look how ugly that looks do and
honestly us fucking fucked we're
starting to pull off now what I will say
okay what I will say about it though as
I'm pulling this off I can definitely
tell that in the areas I have the face
shield it's a little bit more smooth
than the my skin so it definitely is
smoother oh my god ah that's getting my
baby ears okay so as you can see here
foundation is completely gone it is just
so weird I'm not taking this you know
okay we're gonna keep we're gonna keep
beside chillin we're gonna go ahead and
apply a layer of powder on the right
side and see how it acts with the layer
of powder if it's more matte or not
because I feel like it's very very very
shiny even underneath the foundation
it's so shiny I still look like a
fucking donut man okay guys honestly it
looks a lot worse with the powder on I'm
not gonna lie it looks much cake here it
much heavier oh my god please no ah when
I was 18 did I think I was gonna be
peeling off foundation off my face
no sure didn't sure did now I'm just
thinking about getting some dick just
kidding that was straight back then
right okay so what are my final thoughts
on this a face shield of products I
think that you guys should definitely
save your fucking money I do think that
when you put it over your poorest areas
or over your pimples it doesn't gives
you a flatter layer to place foundation
on but the problem with this is that it
cracks and it feels way too fast any
kind of movement that you do on the face
no matter where you put it I can tell
even on the police's on my forehead I
know it's super super shiny underneath
and it's like you know that there's
something there's like a type of a weird
masky film underneath it so I just don't
think that it's the most practical thing
ever out of me say for me this is a Miss
I really don't like how it looks and
it's such a bitch to take off look at me
I'm a fucking I will leave this link
down below just in case you guys do you
want to check it out you guys want to
buy it I would not really suggest but
maybe if you guys have a pimple on one
area like a very very small pimple just
like and that could work I guess just
fine but I would definitely just fuck I
just let the pimple live let it breathe
let the bitch breathe and go away okay
as always guys so grace for the night or
day whoever you guys are and I will
catch you guys in my next video bye you
guys
we're done we're good--we're Gucci
Malcolm is gonna fucking take Hey look
at my good eatin
look at that shit it's fucking nasty I'm
gonna go wash it off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
