so today there's going to be a smoky eye
valentine's day kind of inspired look
basically this look says don't leave
your man in a room with me cuz I'm gonna
steal him if you do that's what this
book says so and it's true so yeah so
today's videos gonna be actually a
collab with what would Lizzie do aka
Lizzie aka whoa whoa I'm so excited to
be climbing with her she's so amazing I
met her at the Anasazi end of the hills
Halloween party last year
and mean her hid off like like fucking
like what I don't know what this is but
I was that's what we hit it off we hit
it off so well she was so fucking funny
like right away meet her cracking up so
hard and I really I swear every event
like I go to now is like she's there and
I'm like bitch you fucking bitch so when
we decided to do a classic a that I was
just like Hama yes yes it was funny
because I when I first met her at the
Anasazi party the first thing she said
to me she's like I saw a video of yours
you're gonna be big and it was so
amazing to hear that from her I was
watching her videos and I saw videos of
her previously to that night and she was
like you're a bitch to watch out for and
I was like me so I was so excited hear
from her honestly she's so amazing you
actually go check out her channel she's
gonna be doing a soft curly romantic he
kind of look and I'm gonna do more of a
bold smoky eye like pornstar kind of
look so if you guys are into that like
DP smoky eye kind of going out at
nighttime to the club look stay watching
for mine if you guys are more into the
fun flirty romantic kind of look go out
to Lizzie's I'm so happy to be clapping
with her she's fucking sick as hell I
don't know what else to say besides if
you don't like it don't fucking watch it
you know the drill if you don't want to
see it what putting on makeup then don't
watch it without further ado I'll get
you guys to the tutorial hopefully you
guys like it I'll see you guys soon
peace so today we're gonna start off
with our base completely done already
already have my bronzer have my contour
i got my highlight going you know I'll
do blush a thin but today we're gonna be
doing a bold smoky eye so I figured why
waste time doing like the face and the
base first so so we're just going to the
eyes on camera instead okay so first
things first we're gonna go in with our
Sigma e-40 be choosing cream by making
peak of course because you know that's
my life and they're actually gonna mix
it in with when it called dusty rose by
Anasazi Beverly Hills it's gonna be our
transition shade just enough and just
take that into the crease if you feel
like you've gone a little heavy-handed
with the dusty rose go back in with
beaches only and then just kind of put
that above what we just did because I
really wanted to still have that nice
rosy tone don't need to be neat it's
just our transition see that shit mm-hmm
I like it
next we're gonna so see bumpy Hills
bling eyeshadow and that's gonna be our
highlight it's just basically like a
satin white eyeshadow right here on our
highest plans we're gonna go in with the
Sophie three one side now we're just
gonna kind of bring down and buff it in
to our transition shades because it's
gonna kinda help ask any hard lines
because obviously we want no hard lines
whatsoever and just go back in with that
forty and just blend okay then we're
gonna go in with makeup geek bit in
which of course you guys know is another
one of my all-time favorite colors of
life I fuckin love memes on a more feet
em 4-3-3 and now we're just gonna run
into our lower crease area
please don't want that warmth and that
purpley like maroon tone to it now we're
just gonna take right into the crease be
very light handed with this because the
makeup geek shuttle or just a extremely
pigmented like they're they're bomb you
guys know this you guys know how I feel
about them and now we're just gonna run
into our crease right into that dusty
rose and beaches and cream color this is
why we have them down first they kind of
help blend them out
now we're going with that same Sigma
e-40 and blend out that color so there's
no hard lines maybe Beach a doze blend
out extremely extremely well they don't
have filler in them like other shadows
do so they're gonna blend out really
nicely and really like prettily you know
like really fuckin burly like Halo
fuckin priority you know so then we're
gonna go in with that same Smurf eat em
for three three and non accessibility
Hills beauty marked a shadow which is a
deep deep deep plum and we're gonna get
in very little bit on our brush break
tiny amount and that we're gonna kind of
press on onto the outside of our eye
even lower than bitten right into the
crease and then this we're gonna
actually take all the way in because
we're doing this nice deep smoky eye and
I want that
Marone plummy tones to come through I
don't want to just be completely covered
so we're gonna kind of take that all the
way in keep your eyes open fit so you
can see how much color you're gonna be
depositing and now that we have that
nice deep dark plum color down we're
gonna go back in with that same Sigma
e-40 this is like a constant constant
that you guys need to keep consistently
blending out with this Sigma e-40 I
swear when morphe creates a brush that's
like this Sigma e-40 like they're gonna
rule the world officially because I love
the morphe brushes and they're so cost
efficient but I cannot live without a
sigma e40 you know I mean so now we have
this nice gradient that's very plumb and
like maroon see that so now we're gonna
grab the NYX jumbo pencil in black bean
and a makeup geek our V brush which is a
very dense brush any dense brush will
work we're gonna take that black bean
and we're gonna run that on our lid very
lightly mostly by the last night we're
just positing that black bean by the
lash line and then with that outer V
brush we're gonna kind of buff it
outwards or buff it upwards you know I'm
saying you know
if you notice it's not enough just go
back in on that next black bean and just
grab a little more color on yeah I'm
just gonna place a little bit more where
you feel like it's seen because I want
to take that black bean all the way up
to our colors so it's a nice smokey
gradient and then I'll just go back in
with that brush that's a matte morphe
m-43 3 blend around the edges of that
black bean and my colors with no
additional colors at all and the reason
I went with black bean you're gonna see
right now is you're actually going in
with glitter we're going with the
glitter and it's from OCC obsessive
compulsive cosmetics you can find inside
Sephora the glitter is called slate I
wanted a cream base because I wanted to
be a little bit sticky so at the glitter
would stick to it so we're gonna grab a
morphe g15 basically a flat brush and
I'm gonna grab Slate glitter oh my god
doesn't ah be messy please oh we're just
gonna pack the glitter on top of our
smoky eye and basically
Oh bitch yes I'll go ahead of you guys
in a little bit more see this we're
really just packing on the glitter so
that there's no fallout as you can see
on my cheeks there's like literally not
a single glare that's falling down so
that's pretty cool using that cream base
from NYX I love it going right up to our
colors that we had down first so now I'm
gonna back in with the clean em for
three three four more feet and then back
in with beauty mark from Anastasia and I
just really want to blend out those
edges I'm really weird about those edges
being completely blended out as much
possibly and much as possibly as much as
possible so the right up to those edges
and then go back in with that ye forty
and blend out a deep plum tone
to the bottom left now so we can go back
in with that NYX jumbo pencil this is
crucial to our look clearly and we're
gonna take that I run it in our lower
lash line looks like a choppy mess
that's okay we're gonna go back in and
grab a clean Sigma e30 - and we're just
gonna blend out that black cream now
what this look to be extremely smoky and
I want like people to be like oh my god
he can steal my man like that's how I
want this book to be you know I didn't
go back in with that dusty rose and
beaches and cream again just dip into
them we're gonna blend that over our
black I'm actually gonna combined bin
and beauty mark as well we might have
taken it a little too fucking far now
shit I look like a panda I'm just gonna
go back in with beaches and cream and
just go underneath the entire entire
thing to buff out my edges a little bit
more that's better
how these morphe brushes see in my life
I swear don't forget you guys have a
code for morphe mani MUA in all caps not
only can use on the line but you can use
it inside the stores too if you're in
Burbank California and you're at the
morphe store and be like hey you know I

10% it's an affiliate code just letting
you guys know cuz I'd like to tell you
guys these things if you guys want to
use my code you guys told you can I get
a small Commission off of it but if not
you guys aren't into that thing the
brushes are so cost efficient anyway you
guys don't even need my code but if you
guys want to save 10% more do you mmm
okay so now I'm gonna go back into the
anasazi same bling eyeshadow I'm gonna
put that in our inner corner to
highlight our inner corner Oh bitch
we're gonna steal your man we're gonna
steal a man tonight bitch yeah now that
we have our eyes curled we're gonna go
in with that with the Tarte lights
camera flashes mascara which I've been
really liking lately and then on the
bottom as well this is some separating
aft mascara like this shit separates now
for lashes I'm gonna go in with one of
my favorite styles I've been loving
right now which are the blinking beaut
in number fours I've already talked
about these like several times oh my
and I'm so excited because I just became
an affiliate with blinking view I'm so
excited like these lashes you guys I kid
you not like they are my favorite lashes

probably ever used of all the mink
brands I've ever tried like they're so
amazing the band is so perfect they are
fucking everything these lashes are and
I'm gonna fill you with them now so if
you've typed in my code m-g ten I
believe I'll leave a link down below M G
ten use get 10% off the lashes okay so
you guys know that mink lashes are
pretty expensive they're usually from
like 35 to 40 bucks
these ones are 29 and then you also get
a 10% off so you're gonna get of like 25
bucks like that's so good for a mink
lashes like you guys know you know that
if you're getting lashes like mink
lashes for 25 bucks that's a steal I'm
just using a little lash applicator my
friend I'm Jamal Buster gave me
he has like his own lash line so I was
pretty cool makes it a little bit easier
to place them on that's what they look
like like are you kidding me these
lashes give it to me hard okay so I'm
gonna quickly go to the other side off
camera I will be right back okay cool so
