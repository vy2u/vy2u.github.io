today's video is going to be a fun
testing of a product video you guys know
I absolutely love doing these videos you
guys send me the weirdest craziest most
random ass shit and today is no
different whatsoever I got so many
tweets and dm's about this brand this is
the brand pop luxe I believe it's called
pop luxe and this is a glow-in-the-dark
highlighter I've never seen a
glow-in-the-dark highlighter before so
I'm actually really fucking excited so
as always if you guys don't like this
video if you guys do not like me please
don't fucking watch it you know the
drill with that yeah but if you guys do
like this video please subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and
therefore you knew what's up a man
anyway and welcome to my channel thank
you so much for being here I really
really appreciate it
yeah you guys let's go ahead and get
into this review on this
glow-in-the-dark so this is in the shade
nightlife nightlife this looks delicious
eight grams of product twenty two point
twenty eight ounces we got actual
highlighter here there's a mirror which
is awesome and this has a really really
cool intense greenish hue green the
bitch go fuck at work honestly this
could really fuckin work so let's talk
about the product and their brand really
quickly so a little bit about pop luxe I
believe he's also a youtuber this is I
think the brand owner I'm not quite
quite sure I'm looking up the actual
product the shop section here we go
we have nightlife glow-in-the-dark
highlighter $23 so it says here for the
best results start a minimally and build
up no glow baby this highlighter is
cruelty-free vegan tuck free gluten and
paraben free so we're just gonna go in
kind of fuckin excited okay guys so this
one looks like I guess again I showed
you guys this what it looks like it has
like a really intense greenish undertone
it's crazy I kind of want to put it
against my light and then go like this
and see if it closes you know I'm saying
so now we're gonna turn off the lights
and see how it looked in the dark okay
I'm putting it directly in front of the
camera can you guys see a glow huh I
don't really see a glow in person not
too much I'm gonna shine my light okay
we're gonna do this this is what we're
gonna do here we're gonna feed this
motherfucker some light honey yeah you
can call me some lab buddy it's glowing
more oh my god I can no 100% see it oh
one of you guys can tell in the light
but I promise you in person it's totally
fucking working
Oh No okay guys the lights are back on
and it 100% got brighter when the lights
were off I was like shocked that it was
absorbing light because I feel like one
of the this is one of those things where
it's like is this gonna work is it gonna
work I'm gonna go ahead and dunk my
little brush my little more feet and
five ten you guys know it's not too
powdery whatsoever which is nice we're
gonna go ahead and highlight oh my god
this is fucking beautiful I'm sorry I'm
shaken to the fucking core the color
itself though is really pretty and it's
very very reflective but I'm very happy
about because I mean it's working
because of the fact that it does have
that greenish blue undertone it's
definitely going to make you look a
little bit more pale a little bit more
dad it's not one of those highlights
doesn't make you look so healthy and
alive this is gonna make you look like
higher cheekbones and much more like
intense and contoured but I'm actually
really living for it so far and I'm
gonna shine my motherfucking flashlight
on my face and he's got it done and
we're gonna see how it looks in the dark
bug I'm excited so as you guys can see
I'm right here in the center I'm gonna
see if this highlighter actually does
glow in the dark or not so let's go
ahead showing the light onto my cheek
and start absorbing that fucking
highlight buddy I don't know you guys to
me this is not glowing in the dark this
is like a really fun reflective intense
green blue highlighter for sure
I don't see how it's not glowing for me
okay cool so the lights are now on and
this is where the height looks like of
course with the lights on it does it's
extremely beaming it's a fucking intense
it's very very blinding and actually
quite beautiful but when I turn the
lights off it didn't glow in the dark it
didn't like I didn't see a difference
maybe you felt I was out I like the
middle of the night at like midnight I
don't I don't think I did I mean my room
was fucking pitch-black and I saw
absolutely no glow Klink off from my
face but in the pan it does glow I don't
know this is one of those products works
like a conundrum really the park is all
have you bought this you wouldn't be so
disappointed because the park is fucking
stunning on the face it really truly is
but I don't know if it really goes in
the dark so what are my final thoughts
on this highlighter do I like it do I
not like it what do I think does
actually glow-in-the-dark I always
expect to go full fucking glowing streak
on my face but I think I was having a
little bit of a high expectation when it
comes to this yeah technically it did
not work but the product still was a hit
for me I actually really enjoy it I
think it's really pretty and I'll
definitely wear it again I'm not
disappointed look at what the flash how
blinding that fucking bitches come on
look at that
mm-hmm it's so intense let's watch on
the hand it feels great look at this
shit guys what the fuck dude like that
she's that is wrong with how blinding
that shit is it's wrong it is 100 sound
proof for me hell yes potlucks I just I
still feel like I'm using it a little
bit wrong and it could have glowed in
the dark for me but who knows let me
know in the comments if you guys have
tried to if it does glow in the dark for
you what I did wrong hey guys thank you
