today's video is going to be a fun ass
reviewable because reviews are always so
much fun and I love doing these so much
and today's video is going to be a
review on the derma coal film studio
waterproof SPF 30 hypoallergenic full
coverage foundation god that's a
mouthful
I've been getting tagged so much on
Twitter to try out this foundation and I
bought it on Amazon I think it was like
15 bucks on Amazon and it won prime so I
got it within literally like today so it
was really really cool to get it so yeah
guys that's today's video is going to be
I'm going to be doing a review on this
derma Col full coverage ass foundation
you guys always find the most random as
things for me to try out so I'm like oh
hey cool you guys have not led me astray
yet Oh have you
maybe a little as always if you guys
don't like this video guys do not like
me please don't watch it you
know the Jo with that okay but you guys
like this video please subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and if
you're new what's up and man you a and
welcome to my channel thank you so much
for being here yeah guys it's going to
get into this full coverage foundation
review on the derma Cole found nation is
this the most pigmented foundation in
the world who knows that's what
everyone's been saying so let's test it
out so let's go ahead and get started on
today's video I'm just moisturizer on my
face I have nothing else on I'm gonna go
ahead and prime it as well I'm just into
my normal face routine like I normally
would so I'm taking benefit
Porefessional or any kind of pore
minimizing primer those ones are like
the most because God knows that he'd
help you guys I'm seriously starting to
graze on the sides here into my hair but
I'm not mad because I'm so into dudes I
have like salt-and-pepper hair so like
that's so daddy goes oh bug
uh-huh there's the okay let's read up on
this bad boy
so benefits of this foundation it is
waterproof hypoallergenic for all skin
types SPF 30 preservative free and the
coverage is full / extreme was created
as the first of its kind in Europe and
one of the first in the world boo that
just gave me my title world's
first full coverage foundation the
license first foundation was eventually
sold to Hollywood it contains 50%
pigment which makes it a weapon against
skin imperfections
economy covers acne lots of imitation
vitiligo was a post
bruising tattoos etc you guys I bought
three shades because the color selection
online was so shitty and I had googled
like swatches of the colors who knows
maybe none of them match me because I
thought it was a really really tough
color selection but so it comes like
this in this golden little tube it has
like that little sharp point so I'm
assuming it's one of those that you like
pop yep a little popper don't do poppers
we literally just to do ad okay guys so
I grabbed a couple shades of foundation
this is in the shade 221 guys honestly
the color selection was really really
rough so I grabbed this shade right here
I mix these two together 210 and 221 I
mixed the two light shades out so we're
gonna do so I'm going to take a little
bit on my finger that's we're going with
so oh yeah that feels very very viscous
but also at the same time it does feel
kind of lightweight shockingly so on my
hand like when I'm feeling on my finger
I'm like oh it feels pretty like wait
I'm gonna dot it with my hand on the
right side face I mean use a brush with
other side I'm gonna use a sponge on
this side so let's test if this really
is the world's most full coverage as
foundation let's see you guys live you
guys need to let me know oh I think we
are definitely getting somewhere with it
okay artists you guys this is probably
the most full color tension I've ever
tried not gonna lie
do you see that this is some drag
honey this is some drag makeup okay
honestly claims I am yeah I'm Chuck
because this is honestly one of the most
full coverage foundations I've ever
tried and this is with using with a
sponge I literally took the smallest
little like pea not even a pea I'm sorry
I took like a small ass amount and I
just mix them together and that's what
we got so now we're gonna take on a more
feat m43 9 and I'm gonna try putting it
on with this brush and not with a sponge
and see how this one applies is apply
more full coverage is a bite less who's
know oh it looks so intense I'm actually
taking a little bit down my neck as well
I usually don't like to do liquids on my
neck but I do have discoloration on my
neck like it's like a ring I will I will
get that checked out soon I really
should get that checked dogs I don't
know what the that is
I'm soon
honey this is some cake oh my gosh okay
honestly I neck feels disgusting like
yeah this is basically a full face of
concealer my face has never looked so
porcelain ever it's like insane how full
coverage this is I couldn't even I
can't even believe it really it's insane
and the part that's tripping me out is
that this is a more of a dewy finish as
you guys can see like it's almost like a
has a glowy finish it's not matte and I
would think they have a more really
intensely full coverage foundation we
have more of a matte finish I don't know
why my mind I just see it as being more
matte it's a very dewy finish and I'm
shaking
to the core I'm just gonna set it
real quick has it set I want it to
crease I was gonna lightly set the rest
of my face with our CMA no color powder
and I have my verdict for this
foundation and there we have it you guys
this is the face completely set as you
guys can see it has covered up literally
everything god I can't even I can barely
even see that mole barely my
discoloration is gone I don't really see
it in the camera on if you guys can but
I can't see in the mirror I'm looking at
I cannot see my discoloration on my neck
uh this is really intense this is
definitely the most intense foundation
I've ever ever tried or ever worn it's
literally as if I did a full face of
full coverage concealer that is like the
level of what this is right now it's so
intense it feels pretty heavy on the
skin doesn't feel very lightweight um
even though it is a lighter weight
consistency I was kind of shocked it
wasn't as thick and intense as I thought
it was it's a little bit more
lightweight than I was expecting but it
is like honestly like I think it looks
really pretty and I think it's full
coverage as and I think if you want
a lot of coverage it's super super nice
and for those of you guys who do have
automatic skin or texturize skin or
things like that like I do you know I
get pimples all the time and I have
textured skin I think this will really
work for you guys
and it's only 15 to 20 bucks I don't
think that's very bad but the color
selection sucks it really does I'm
really bummed at about the color
selection 220 which is like two shades
away from the darkest color is like
barely darker than my own face and I'm
light so I think that's kind of annoying
and I don't think that's very fair and I
definitely think there should be more
shades made for different skin tones but
other than that I think that the
foundation worked I think it's
definitely the most full coverage
foundation I've ever ever worn and if
I'm sure if I had a tattoo that she
would cover it up on the face
I want to tend to but yeah you guys I
hope you guys enjoyed this review and
demo of this derma coal foundation it's
very intense very full coverage very
in-your-face
but honestly I end up really really
liking it and I think it's definitely
definitely man MUA approved it's full
coverage is awesome
looking on the skin I look like a
 porcelain mannequin and I live
yeah guys anyway I'll leave it where to
buy this linked down below I love you
guys so much of grace tonight or day
where you guys are and I'll catch you

backgrounds holographic cuz I don't you
