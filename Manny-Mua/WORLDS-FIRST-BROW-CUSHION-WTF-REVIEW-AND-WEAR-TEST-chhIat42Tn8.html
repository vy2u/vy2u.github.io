what's up you guys today's video is
going to be a review video and I'm so
excited I'm so so excited to film this
video because it is the world's first
brow cushion I'm sure a lot of you guys
have seen there have been so many
different products that come out that
are like cushion products so it's like
foundation that's like in a cushion or
it's a primer that's Ana cushion or
bronzer or blush or highlighter and like
a little cushion that you like hold it
you press down and it literally feels
like a little sponge and so this is no
different iconic London came out with a
Moroccan and I'm so curious about this
because I've never seen anything like
this eyebrow cushion I'm like what the
fuck
like bitch that's like little use a
little sponge do you see the shit oh
delivery guys as you can see it's
literally a little sponge so fucking
weird and I'm like you know what this
looks like really really fun and I
really wanted to try it out I've been
very very intrigued by it iconic lemon
have such a beautiful products they had
like that really really nice illuminator
that I used in a couple videos back and
it was so nice I was like do I need to
give them a try so I left my brows
completely empty so we were going to
fill in the brow and see how we like
this a brow cushion I'm very intrigued
by this guy so that's what's a zero is
going to be as always if you guys do not
this video if you guys do not like me
please don't fucking watch it you know
the drill with that but you guys that do
like this video please go ahead and give
it a thumbs up and subscribe to my
channel if you're not already and yeah
guys let's go ahead and get in to this
brow cushion demo video review thank
okay guys so let's read on the product
really quickly before we start getting
in to it we have the a'course iconic
London limited edition sculpt and boosts
eyebrow cushion it retails for $39 which
is a higher price point actually that's
a pretty high price point not gonna lie
so I believe it comes in three different
types of shades it comes with a medium a
fair and a deep shade so this guy comes
with six grams of product which actually
is a great amount that's great what you
do is you use a little brush that it
comes with which looks like this which
is really cool that it comes with a
little brush comes with a spoolie and it
comes with a brush you use this
applicator use the brush end of the
applicator to brush your natural
eyebrows into place so balance the
angled brush and okay great I'm so
excited just try it
so you guys we're gonna go in we have
this logo right here it looks like a
cushion it's a cushion I'm gonna go in
with the brush just gonna dip in and
we're just gonna start to lightly
feather this this is it's a very quick
drying formula so you can layer if you
guys want to so this is well looks like
so far I'm starting to build on and pile
on the color where the pressure is going
on a very smooth it's literally like
going on like water if that makes any
sense I'm like this is the most liquidy
thing I've ever gone in on my brows with
ever and the brush it comes with it's
actually pretty good it really does
angle it quite nicely it's very very
small I'm kind of living and I'm using
it the medium don't even thought you
have to be careful though because this
can go awry real but look at that look
at that it can go awry it's gonna move
around until it dries fully so be
careful with that the part that is kind
of annoying is right here it starts to
get a little bit streaky so I'm sorry
there so right there
it's streaky right there it's tricky
like this product doesn't go on full
pick it gives you like a little bit of
leeway so this is one of those things
where I would actually prefer to go on a
little bit more intense and a little bit
more full coverage and not as like
streaky because it does leave you
streaks in your brow which of course is
not the luck just knots not the look
tiny it's not the look okay let me
quickly go ahead and clean up this brow
because I feel like she's getting a
little messy okay guys so this is the
brow so far I don't know man I'm not
like living in truly I'm really not I
think it's kinda hard to use but what
we're gonna do is I'm gonna go in with
the deep one and see if that makes a
difference because I do think because I
am using the
the medium maybe that has something to
do with it like maybe that's why it's
making it a little harder for me let's
go and try to go in with the deeper one
and use that to outline and do like the
darker moments I thought I like this
brush I think that I need something a
little bit longer for me yeah it works
but I think that view to get optimal
usage out of the product itself I would
use a different brush bitch that she got
Nast which means that it would last a
long time on the face which is good I'm
over here kind of filling in a
patchiness with the darker shade which
is working though it's kind of fixing
the problem right there this needs to be
longer and less fat that's another thing
too I just noticed this needs to be much
longer okay guys so this is the brow so
far this is all we got
I think we finally got it there it was
not the easiest thing to achieve doesn't
just see like it the more like if you go
over it trying to pile on more color it
takes off the color underneath which is
frustrating me that's the part that's
getting me pissed because I feel like it
didn't do that I would actually be
liking it a lot more but the brow on
camera it looks sickening there's no
denying it I actually really do like all
the brow Lux but I don't know it's
frustrating me okay I'm gonna finish
other brows off of camera and I'll be
right back okay guys so she just got
this brow on right now we're here the
left one I put on off of camera so I
used the Anastasio number twelve brush
and it went on so much better than using
the brush that it came with so that is
something I wanted to note in for us
right now that it went on so much easier
so much better so much smoother using a
different type of brush one that is like
a little bit thicker a little bit more
dense and a longer spoolie like I was
saying earlier I don't think they're
very even I feel that this is a little
bit hard to manipulate I think it's not
very user friendly so for example if you
are a beginner or someone that doesn't
do the brows that often I think this is
gonna be actually really really hard for
you because the formula itself is so
lightweight any little movement can
really fuck you up truly and I'll just
go all over the place and when you're
blending out the brow continuously the
product underneath it will lift off and
it becomes like really really patchy and
streaky that it's kind of an annoying
thing that I am noticing I have to kind
of read go over it with a smaller detail
brush it gets out to like lay down the
product at the ends so it doesn't become
streaky the side has gotten a little bit
streaky as I have continued on but girl
dust I feel like it's kind of
unavoidable at this point I feel like
it's a little bit unavoidable so
the cons to me with the pro wise I
really do think that the color turned
out really nicely and it feels like it's
very dry on the brow I bet this shit
would last you like oh three days on
your skin like it just feels very very
like it's not going anywhere I mean look
I try to wipe off the fucking gun from
my finger and that shit's still there
like it's not gonna come off easily I
can't have you fucking tell even on the
box is said to use oil to remove so I'm
like oh so those are the pros I think
it's gonna last a really long time on
the brow finally on nice and I do with
like how it looks now kind of it's not
like my favorite brow product so I
decided to do guys is I'm actually gonna
go out I have plans later on tonight I'm
gonna go eat dinner with some friends
and then go to the movies and I'm gonna
come back later on tonight and I'm gonna
keep the makeup on I'm gonna keep my
brows on at least the brows and I tell
you guys how they lasted throughout the
next couple hours and see if they faded
how they look you guys aren't able to
tell me on camera I see how they look on
camera and we'll do a check-in
to see what we think of the brows and
how they turned out I don't know Matt I
feel like this is like the old school
brow I used to do like it's so fucking
sharp and so like intense I always see
you guys very shortly
prepare yourself or make it double just
kidding I saw you guys we were doing a
quick check-in on the browser now they
are still on and what do you think of
them it was it was difficult to apply
but it still looks good we went to
dinner we watched a movie everything's
still on like exactly how I left it just
so oily it looks like your skin we have
sister James Charles Brody and we have
Tyler anyway guys the brows are looking
pretty good they're not like touch it no
okay anything cool we'll see like that
was like trying really really hard
that's a good sign
that's pretty good
yeah whoa
so guys I'll check in a couple of next
what is up you guys so I'm finally back
I know it's been like a two seconds for
you and it's for me it's been about
seven hours since I have applied at this
product it is currently 112 in the
morning I can see that it's literally 1
12 in the morning pretty late I actually
filmed that like around 7 the bitch is
going fucking strong here ok so this is
a moment I know you guys saw on the clip
but here there's a little spot that's
missing edges here and that wasn't it
with Nikita using her nail to kind of
like go like this and see what happened
and of course a little part of it did
come off because it is like a dried
product on your skin you're gonna
scratch away at it it will come off
hopefully other than that you guys it
stayed on so absolutely well I feel like
it looks completely the same and you can
see there's still so much product left
in the brow even if you did wipe it hard
I really do think that this product
stayed on my face very very very well
that looks pretty good like it looks
pretty good for six hours of wear bitch
I'm not mad like I'm not mad like you
can be like this and nothing's going
anywhere like it really is truly dried
down very nicely and there's no product
on my fingers either yeah you guys I
think we have the final verdict ok guys
so all in all what did I think of the
iconic London brow cushion so this are
my price point it's $39 so ok like 40
bucks plus tax like plus tax plus
shipping it'll probably end up being
around 50 bucks I already I'm sorry is
too high of a price point that is not
what I'm jamming with on associate dip
brow is like 20 bucks so that already is
like mmm absolutely not I just come with
2 colors so it's kind of like so I would
say the price point is already way too
high product itself going on it's
actually really really hard to use it's
not the most user-friendly I think it's
because it's so liquidy it gets all over
the place it's not like something you
can put down and like manipulate while
it's down it's like you have to know and
be sure why are you putting it down
because it's going to get there it's
liquidy it's going to move all over the
place so you need to be very sure of it
the actual applicator itself it's too
short to actually get a good grasp on it
and it's a little bit too long
weird like it applies to long and saw
thick and dense enough I do think that
it looked beautiful on the brows my
friends were all complimenting me saying
how good my brows looked on like the
brows Holly
on like the product itself in the brow
looked amazing the way dry down it
looked absolutely great everyone was
saying that and it lasted a very very
very long time and I that packaging is
cute it does come with a mirror it comes
with little compartment for the brush
you get your little thing which is
covered with a little plastic container
which is great it really I'm happy they
did that and this is made in China and
PRC whenever something says made in PRC
by the way it's made in China
the mirror is fantastic by the way I
mean it's great oh my god I'm such an
oil slick and disastrous mess I haven't
touched on my foundation one time all in
all I think the product worked really
really well but is it worth the price
from all I don't think it's worth the
price I think it's too expensive at 50
bucks it's just a little bit too far out
there but the product worked so well so
this is something for you guys like I'm
not gonna say it was hit or miss cuz it
really for me it was a hit it worked but
there's so many different things that
play into it like the price point
usability on it when you're actually
applying it on the brow how easy it is
how it lasts on your brow how it looks
when it's on there's a lot of moving
parts guys to me it was a hit but for
you guys it could totally be a Miss
because of the price point being is so
high and I totally understand it's very
very very expensive and I really don't
think that it is worth $50 I would pay
25 bucks this is a cushion fucking brow
park it's so unique in so weird but I
really like that about it I wanted to
review it and if you guys aren't into
like weird quirky products like that I
think you guys would enjoy it a lot but
yeah you guys that's it for today's
video hope you guys enjoyed it and had
fun watching you guys know I love doing
reviews cuz there's such a fun intricate
process of being a beauty youtuber is
like getting to do reviews on weird-ass
shit that you're like is this gonna work
or there's gonna be a flop some I
actually really did enjoy the product
but I think it is too expansive that
shit breaks the bank anyway guys ever
