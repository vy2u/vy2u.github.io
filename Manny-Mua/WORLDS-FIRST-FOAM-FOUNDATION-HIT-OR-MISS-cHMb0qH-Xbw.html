today's video is going to be a testing
of a new foundation that I saw online as
a couple people were tweeting me about
this foundation saying hey man you
should try this out it looks a little
funky it's a little weird and I'm like
okay I'm totally down to try out and
test out some products for you guys as
long as you guys are requesting it and I
did see a bunch of you guys requested me
to review this foundation and so I
bought a couple shades this is the
foundation right here Elizabeth Arden
flawless finish mousse makeup so it's a
mousse makeup but it looks like a foam
it's like the weirdest I saw it online
they look like the weirdest weirdest
consistency about a couple shades cuz I
know Claire I am I hate shopping for
foundations and can see those online
that's like the worst thing to me I need
to go into a store and get match like I
cannot like I can't so I bought a couple
shades and we're gonna be testing out
this foundation today I'm gonna wait for
a couple hours and see how it lasts on
the skin looks funky and I really want
to do a person sessions with you guys to
try it out on camera so yeah guys that's
today's video I hope you guys enjoy it
as always if you guys like this video if
you guys don't like me please don't
fucking watch it you know chill with
that but if you guys you like this video
please give it a thumbs up and subscribe
to my channel if you weren't already and
if you're new what's up a man named you
a and welcome to my channel thank you so
much for being here I really really
appreciate it and yeah let's go and get
into this first impressions of this foam
foundation so let's me about this little
thing real quick in the back what it
says this is for normal skin natural
coverage translucent finish makeup so
flawless so natural it looks like your
own skin it's like a light airy cloud of
color
well okay then we'll see if that is the
truth or not this is 1.4 ounces 40 grams
of product which is actually more than
normal foundations it's usually one
ounce of products that's pretty cool can
you hear that sounds a little weird it
sounds like a no each time so we have
base 40 I don't think I'm gonna be based
for the honest on your iPod a fucking
shame an idiot so it's cuz I like to go
on a tan
um let's do buff 26 so we're gonna
testicle and see how it comes out so it
sounds like an or aerosol
oh my god this feels so funky that is
darkest hits are you kidding that's not
that's not gonna work I can't use that
we have a bisque 25 okay they're
oxidizing like really dark like really
dark and I like to go dark with my
foundation I do don't get me wrong bad
at all this is like hail a dark and
these are like the lighter shades with
the fuck
okay I'm gonna find one hold on even if
it doesn't matter okay
this one how is it that beige forty is
the closest to me other than che 25 so
the foundation itself is $35 which is
really not a bad price point cuz
Elizabeth Arden is a higher-end brand
comes in this really funny funky like
almost like an aerosol like hairspray
finish can so we're gonna go ahead and
ply it with a brush and with the Beauty
Blender half and half already I'm
already priding by the way after days
I'm gonna use with a kabuki brush okay
let's look it on okay
the finish is very pretty it's very
natural like they were saying very very
natural pretty lightly finish the color
is not that bad this is not the amount
of coverage that I usually go for like I
need more coverage in this so we're
gonna try to build another layer on top
of it but for now we're going to apply
one let it dry this is what half the
face looks like with it on and half
without it and it looks really really
pretty its oxidizing darker that I can
tell in the camera it's getting a little
darker as it's like playing with my skin
who looks like a little worm Sohrab you
blend I just notice that you need a lot
more product for the Beauty Blender side
so much foundation for the side holy
crap with a Beauty Blender I would
definitely just not using this with a
Beauty Blender definitely use it with a
brush I definitely think it did a great
job at evening out my skin tone it looks
very very pretty very natural and very
light weight I'm looking to be firing on
so I can explain it to guys umm looks
pretty nice you guys I'm not I'm really
not mad at this I'm mad at the fact that
if you're using what the be learning
needs so much fucking product that's
what I'm annoyed about but other than
that use it with a brush use it with a
fucking mesh
we're gonna apply another layer with my
trust
why six amazing flat top kabuki you guys
just saying see how this bitch builds
such I like to build especially on the
cheek area in the t-zone because I have
the most problematic areas right here
and the center of my face this is like
such a wet luminous finish though like
it's like really really hell away from
my oily skin girl I don't know about
this it feels like a serum hey guys so
this is with two layers on my skin as
you can see very very very natural so
I'm gonna apply some concealer now and
see how it reacts with some concealer
and just also just to give me some
coverage because shit okay so that's
under eyes real quick okay once the
under eyes are set you're gonna go and
set the rest of the face I always always
set my foundation so I have to really
give this Foundation a fair shot and set
the entire face with it because I
wouldn't actually set my entire face
with any other foundation so I'm going
to take the cover effects perfect
setting powder the claims are true news
Melbourne VIC the powder pressing it in
okay guys so this is the base of the
face is how it looks right now I think
looks absolutely beautiful actually like
I really do like I'm not disappointed
with how pretty it looks it looks really
really nice but we will see how this
will how long this lasts I'm gonna keep
it on for a couple hours and I'll be
checking back in with you guys to see
how this makeup lasted I'm not gonna
really do anything too shy add bronzer
and stuff to it okay I'm gonna add a
little bit of bronzer to it to see how
it would like handle a bronzer grab any
bronzer I'm taking the Physicians
Formula butter bronzer bronze up the
skin this was so good
okay now that I'm actually bronzy this
is what the bronzer looks like on it
wrapped it like any of my other
foundations would it wasn't patch it
wasn't crazy a little bit patchiness on
the forehead over here what are you
doing but other than that it turned out
really really pretty and I'm really
really impressed so I'll be back in a
couple of hours to see how the
foundation lasted throughout the next
couple hours
hey guys I'm back so it has been about
five hours since I first put on the
foundation I was watching a movie with
zaiah I filmed a tutorial on this eye
look I have right now what should be
going up very very soon if you guys want
to see that let me know I finally have
my opinion on this Elizabeth Arden
foundation so in about five hours and as
you can see my skin is actually really
really greasy and oily so
this is literally the third time in the
day that I've had a Pat powder over my
face to get the oil off to make a little
bit more flat I'm gonna screw up a
little more so you guys can see what it
looks like after five hours so my skin
my nose on of you guys in Tollin Cameron
but it's really really broken up right
here it's a broken up hardcore there's a
patch here missing a foundation from
putting the hat on and off but that's
like such a subtle movement like it
obviously can be taken off easily yeah
oh yeah that was annoying um and that's
set to so the final verdict on the
foundation is it worth it is it worth
the thirty five dollars what I ever wear
it again
what do I think about it all in all I
don't like it I feel so bad because
whenever I do videos like this like
dedicated videos to testing something
out they always end up like feeling for
me I end up not liking it and I'm like
fuck man I mean like find something that
I review that actually end up liking but
this so far I don't really like it and
these are the reasons I think the
coverage was nice it was really pretty
the finish in the beginning was really
really nice I thought the foundation
looked beautiful and even right now
looking at my skin it looks pretty it's
glowy
it's like looks like fucking patch it
looks like really ethereal and it looks
really really pretty and like skin like
right but that's with two layers of this
foundation on and I got so oily drop the
entire day I had a blob three fucking
times and the fucking foundation is
coming off so easily the nose is
completely broken up in the center out
of you guys should actually tell but I
can see in person how literally like
this whole part right here is like
little spots and it's literally broken
up and also you have to use a brush with
this foundation you can't really use a
Beauty Blender because it soaks up too
much product or it just disperses it
really really weird I don't know why
like you have to use a brush with this
foundation or else it's gonna look like
literally there's nothing there which is
fine that's looking for now for 35 bucks
that's just a no-go for me so all in all
do I think this whole nation is worth
days they're worth thirty five dollars
no I do not am I ever gonna wear this
again no I'm not if you guys are normal
and dry maybe we'll work for you I mean
even the box said for normal skin so
that's a claim saying for a normal skin
if I had an almost kin maybe I would
like it more but I don't right now
because I don't have normal skin
I'm oily so therefore I do not like it
as much as someone with normal skin or
dry skin might but thank you guys for
sending me the requests to check out
this foundation it was so fun to do it's
such a
weird foundation it's a foam foundation
