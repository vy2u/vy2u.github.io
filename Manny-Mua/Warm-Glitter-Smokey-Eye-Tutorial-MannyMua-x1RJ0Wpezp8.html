the skies hold on just let us escape
Iowa tonight
hey guys welcome back to my channel it
feels so good to be back I'm gonna be
back for a little while I just got back
from LA maybe your froat no not even
little well damn
I'm gonna be going back to LA next week
of beautycon but I'm just glad to be
back I really wanted to film tutorial
for you guys while I was here because a
lot of you guys requested me to do a
look using boom boom Rhone shadow by Mac
you guys follow me on snapchat you guys
know I was like if you guys can before
it sells out go by boom boom boom shadow
which is the one on my lid right now it
is the most different multi-dimensional
glittery shadow I've ever tried and it's
so freakin sickening and so you guys go
buy it or don't talk to me everyday but
it's seriously so beautiful and I
absolutely love it so I wanted to
recreate the look that I was wearing
when I wore it for the first time during
Fame Expo so I kind of did it as best as
I could
and this is what I came up with just a
more wearable not so red version of it
and I think she no bomb so you
guys want to see how I did this look
please continue to watch if you guys
don't like me like so like this video
don't watch it you can tell the
drill with that but if you like this
video and you guys do like me please
like this video and subscribe to my
channel if you aren't already so yeah
I'm just going to get right into the
video okay who's ready for this tutorial
I've belted so long I'm weird
random weird I'm weird Hank oh I'm ready
to go so I'm asking to go and start this
tutorial with the face already done have
my base on I use the Born This Way
Foundation it's the new one that they
just launched by Too Faced
I am trying for the first time right now
on my face and I think it looks really
really nice and the reason I decided to
my face already is because this tutorial
is more on the like intricate side like
there's more steps to doing this look
then my mama looks but I'm gonna go
ahead and just have my face already done
don't give me no lip sore let's go and
stop this Beach okay cool so first
things first I'm gonna go ahead and
start in with beaches and cream and
Peach Smoothie by makeup geek I'm just
gonna go and mix those on my brush
because I kind of want to be a little
bit more warm than usual I thought I'm
having a little bit of peach smoothie
because I usually go in with my peaches
and cream you guys know peaches and
cream is like my favorite transition
shade of all time but I want it to be
slightly more warm than usual so that's
why I'm heading to Peach Smoothie into
it oh and I'm already primed on the lids
and my brows are kind of filled in with
some brow gel so just get anyone's
wondering like is this bitch really
going in with nothing no i'm marga
primed with this
27 this is like my favorite I'm blending
brush right now it's a very similar
similar do to the e-40 by Sigma and Mac
224 just a really great fluffy blending
brush so it looks something like this
likes just easy transition very very
low-key can even you can see on it so
I'm gonna go and take a more feet and
4-3-3 which is very similar to to the
Mac 217 and then I'm gonna mix cocoa
bear by making peak with secretive by
morphe I just discovered the shadow
recently I haven't actually used it in a
tutorial but it looks so effing pretty
that I literally like how to use it
sometimes it's on the outer corner and
I'm mixing the two cocoa bear and
secretive secretive is a very very very
warm deep maroon color it's so nice it's
so freakin nice I'd never even like own
any of the morphe single shadows I got
them when I was at fame Expo so I was
like Hello what the hell I'm doing we're
not owning any of the single shadows way
more feet okay so I'm gonna go and take
that in for three three and those two
colors and put it into my crease a
little bit lower then I put the
transition colors right up into the
inner corner because this is more of a
smokey eye I'm having my eyes open for
this so I can see exactly where the
shadow will be when my eyes are open the
secretive shadow it reminds me a lot of
bitten but it is more red than bitten so
now I have the shadows down there
they're just placed down there's no
blending going on
I'm sticky 27 and really just blend out
those shadows in to the transition
shades that we had down first it's just
gonna really help keep everything a lot
more blended and a lot more diffuse this
is why I have the shadows down first and
just go in circular motions without you
27 I love this blending brush to death
you are using extremely extremely warm
tones so like you're gonna have to
continue to blend and blend and blend
and just when you think that you're done
blending blend a little bit more and
then you're good I swear and it should
look something like this
nice and blended out very warm cranberry
Brown you know this is my kind
of colors you know now I'm gonna
go in with that same 43 we got a wipe a
little bit off on my pants and then I'm
gonna go in with on a saucy Beverly
Hills beauty mark eyes shadow which is
one of my favorite shadows of all time
it's a beautiful warm plum and took a
plum Brown it's so pretty I use
it all the time you guys don't use the
whole time and I'm gonna concentrate
that on the outer corner because this is
gonna be more of a smoky look and
there's kind of blending it forward into
the crease okay now that you have this
bad boy blend it out nice little warm
and
hence crease going on right now it's
pretty smoky we're gonna go ahead and
grab the Too Faced glitter glue the two
basically looks like this I saw
Jacqueline using this and so obviously I
was like I saw Jacqueline losing that
and we're gonna put that all over the
lid I'm gonna go ahead and use an a
synthetic brush I'm gonna use the morphe
320 so I'm gonna go up with the whole of
the lid all the way up to the crease and
then now for the star of the show that
everyone was asking me to talk about it
is boom-boom room shadow by Mac that's a
dazzle shadow it's one of the newest
shades it's one of the most beautiful
shadows that ever even come across ever
and I'm going to talk on my finger I'm
gonna put that onto the lid and press it
on oh my god I love using this with a
glitter glue down first because it
really makes the shadow pop underneath
it as well as it's gonna stay there all
freakin day
trust me I wear this to an event and net
bitch stayed on now it's gonna take that
n 4-3-3 and just kind of go in to the
crease with it just slightly blend out
any hard lines usually when using
glitter glue and glitter like there will
be hard lines just a little baby amount
of blending will really help and this is
what the top of the lid should look like
I'm gonna go ahead and finish the other
eye off the cameras when we come back
we'll do the bottom of the eyes and
we'll be doing okay well bye so
I have both of the eyes done on the top
they don't even you don't even if it
doesn't toggles you know like thug life
but like the cuter version called
toggles okay right okay since the tops
of eyes are done it's going to focus on
the bottom now we're gonna go and take
Peach Smoothie on my morphe 36 my
favorite pencil brush of all-time
you guys already know by now that it's
like my obsession a bitch can't stop a
bitch can stop for reals
am I going to take my secretive and Coco
bear mixed again on the same brush and
then put that starting on the outer
corner and then I'm gonna go ahead and
work it forward work a good like that
and then we're going to take my morphe
and 508 which is a really tiny baby
lining brush and I'm gonna take that
beauty mark shadow again and put that
close to the lash line I can barely
speak when I do this
to really help darken the outer corner
I'm gonna take the NYX trays ulead black
liner it's like a little gel liner and
I've actually been really liking this
for my waterline I work all famous the
weekend so I really like it
really black and like really creamy
mm-hmm I'm gonna go in tight line my
eyes too so I'm not gonna do liner for
this look I just don't feel like doing
liner so I'm just gonna use this same
Trey Jolie liner and line the inner rim
of my butt I hate doing this okay
so we're now rimmed on the bottom and
rimmed on the top I love rimming I mean
so this is what it should look like the
eye I'm gonna go finish this side real
quick and I'll be right back okay cool
so the tops in the bottom of the eyes
are done so now I'm gonna go buy some
false lashes already put like mascara on
I have my benefit roller lash on top and
my Mac giggle ash on bottom these two
bitches you know these are my
that's I'm like even is know the drill
of the lashes mascara you know so I'm
going to apply my new bouncing Bella
lashes cuz they're in stock right now so
obviously I have no plan mmm okay so
this is what it looks like with the
Bella minks on I'm gonna go ahead zoom
you guys in to see what the final height
looks like really up close so you guys
can see what it looks like what that
looks like what it looks come on man
you're just to zoom in
that was what the eye looks like you
guys are definitely definitely
definitely do eyeliner with this look
you guys didn't do that more subtle lash
I like really dramatic three lashes for
me lashes like this
Bella minks and photos look super super
super great because they're so flared
out and crazy oh yeah if you guys wanna
change up the look a bit do you guys do
you a headliner and lashes whatever you
want to do do it okay I'm gonna finish
the face on camera you might lower here
or queenless doing let's go ahead with
some blush on my face I'm already kind
of bronze I don't if you guys on top
because this exposure is kind of high
because the lighting is kind of crazy in
the room but there is bronzer on my face
I'm gonna go and take one of the new
blushes from Too Faced the I will always
love you blush of all the blushes that
they came out with that I will always
love you is my favorite one it is so
 good I die I'm gonna go and take
down on a more Fiji eight this little I
got a blush brush I like to use it for
blush I would use it on a morphe elite
three brush but they're sold that elites
are sold out I really want you guys to
see another option from morphe which is
another great option which is the g8 for
blush it's so good it picks up product
really nicely and deposits really nice
too and it's embedded this blush is like
a golden peach it's so damn good you
guys get the chance go try it out and
store it does give you a soft glimmering
shimmer to the cheeks so if you guys
have a lot of texture just be weary of
that I mean I don't give a
I love the blushes that I've seen anyway
but if you guys are weary and you guys
don't like that then just be prepared
for the fact that it does have a little
bit of Sheen I love this freaking blush
now look at the blush on I'm gonna go
ahead and take my highlighter now I'm so
excited to be using the Tyler it's
champagne pot by Becca which was in
collaboration with Jaclyn hill I am so
 proud of Jaclyn for being able
to do this with Becca like imagine being
in Sephora like your face is Sephora and
collaborating with a brand that's so
well known has Becca like not only do
you see the progression of Jack and
he'll be you get to see the progression
of Becca cosmetics we feel like it's
such a fitting thing for Becca and
Jacqueline to collaborate so I'm so
proud of her for doing this I'm so happy
for her you know the champagne pop is a
beautiful peachy gold champagne color
I'm not going to take this on my Wayne
Goss 0/2 brush I just got winged glasses
brushes like recently so I'm gonna try
it out I know tried it before champagne
pop on Wayne Goss number two let's do
this
take one Jaclyn hill you little bitch I
love you to death
look at the wind gust brush is what why
are you so good what do they feel so
nice that they feel so good so so what
the heck looks like champagne pop on the
cheeks
absolutely beautiful Jaclyn and Becca
you guys did the most with this in the
best way that's good that is some
good okay time for the EDP this
look is definitely all concentrated on
the eyes I do not want anything too
crazy on the lips because the eyes are
definitely not like the show the eyes
are the like intenseness of the show you
know I don't know I'm saying but I want
the eyes to be the most intense part of
the look so I'm gonna go and take my
next peekaboo neutral lip liner which is
my favorite lip liner of all time it's a
beautiful beautiful like dusty rose warm
pink kind of color works really great
with my lips because it's very somewhere
in color perfect okay cool so for the
lipstick I'm gonna go ahead and take the
melt cosmetics lipstick in the shade
nude it is one of their new lipsticks
after launching it is the most beautiful
freaking pale ass nude but I love a
blocked out lip I think it looks so
freakin cool I love it when it looks
like there's like nothing on the lips
like I'm really weird waiting like let
me alone like this bitch is nude getting
this nude it's like an OD I think I love
it the melt lipsticks smell like
play-doh it's the weirdest thing
oh this looks so cool it's like so
blocked out I love it I don't care what
anyone says I love a blocked out lip and
I don't give a and yeah this is
what the final eye and lip looks like in
the face you guys definitely is a
different kind of lip for this look if
you want to add a little bit more color
and not so block down nude that's
totally cool I wanted to go really nude
with it I really wanted to focus on the
eyes and kind of the cheeks tubes I feel
like the cheeks are very intense I know
I talked really fast I'm sorry I just
noticed it right now that was talking
super super fast I was like what the
 I understand myself perfectly I
hope you guys can too slightly I'm sorry
we talk too fast for you guys but I
really don't even know how to change the
fact that I talk fast cuz I feel like
what I'm talking fast I can get out more
words and I know what I'm saying better

about the words I'm saying and like what
