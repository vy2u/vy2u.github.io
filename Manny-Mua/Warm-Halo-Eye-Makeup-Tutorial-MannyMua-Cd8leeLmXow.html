like trip to go to Dallas but we entered
it and we both won so we're both gonna
be going to Dallas together in like two
weeks so you guys are in the Dallas area
and are interested and saying hi or
whatnot are going to beautycon like I
would love to meet you guys there same
with Patrick I know he's gonna be really
really really excited to meet you guys
and so you should come by if you live in
Texas and you are in the Dallas area I'm
playing oh yeah have you guys so like
this video don't watch it you
know the Jo with that and yes I'm sassy
sometime get alright yes I'll get you
guys to the Toronto sorry for the long
intro but I just had to introduce that
I'm really really really excited to go
to beautycon Dallas clearly in like two
weeks like it's so freakin fast and
random but I'm just like let's pack some
packs and let's go so I don't tell you
guys I'm so excited to see you guys
there
okay I'll get your tutorial I'm sorry
bye guys
okay so we're basically starting with
our base completely done already I have
like my contour on my hand like going I
was bronzed she's Bronson ready to go um
I do not remember exactly what I did for
the tutorial like I don't remember
exactly the colors I use but I basically
grabbed a bunch of clothes I think I use
so we're gonna try to still do it wish
me luck
first we're going to do is run go ahead
and take beaches and cream by makeup
geek which is this color right here and
that's
our transition shake it on an e 40 we're
going to go ahead just toss that into
our crease the reason I'm having it down
first because I want to have a colored
own to be able to blend all my other
colors into first whether it's already
primed by the way it's one I favor
making big shadows of all time I still
need to make a flavor makeup geek shadow
video so let me know if you guys still
want that we're go ahead and mix bitten
by makeup geek and Coco bear by making
geek as well we're to mix them together
we're going to toss that into our outer
corner on a more feet and 4-3-3 which is
brush ladies very often it's very
similar to Mac 217 and we're just gonna
toss it on the outer corner very lightly
very softly the mckeavy shadows are so
freakin pigmented like you guys know
maybe because my favorite brand of all
life and we're also going to toss it
into our inner corner as well right into
our crease so now we get the close down
in the outer and inner corner or eye
we're going to do is we're gonna kind of
make a halo that brush with no
additional color we're going to very
lightly etch out where a crease is very
light motion like that so you can see I
have this nice little ring around my eye
and we're gonna leave the center
completely open cut for our shimmery
colors and ago so we're just leading
that right here so now I'll just go back
in with that same eight forty by Sigma
and I'll just kind of blend the edges
this is why also crucial to have that
beaches and cream color down first so we
could have a base that the colors blend
into nicely see how nicely that's
running out just because we had that
base down it makes such a huge
difference to me now that we have that
nice warm halo we look going down now
I'm actually going to go ahead and grab
a massage Beverly Hills Beauty marked
eye shadow which is basically a very
very very deep dark plum put it right
between the maroon and the inner corner
so we're going to right here this is
going to give us the definition in the
dead we're just going to lightly feather
it and that we're doing that on a like a
little pencil brush like that I got a
little bit more room to that's the outer
corner as well so then I'll go back in
with that same and 4-3-3 and just kind
of blend out those edges again no
additional product I'm just letting it
blend out very softly so it looks
something like this it's a nice dark
halo e effect this is optional but I'm
going to just go back in with a little
bit of black from making V gets called
corrupt had a very tiny amount in the
inner most corner just for that little
bit of extra depth and dimension this
part is optional you definitely don't
need to do this but I figured what the
 why not you know
this buck is very pigmented so you don't
need a lot trust me making like a little
outer V so now we can go in with a clean
brush it's a morphe m4 for one it's just
a clean fluffy brush and that we're just
gonna kind of blend the whole thing this
brush is clean so I just really wanted
to have it there for blending purposes
only not for depositing color and now
I'll go back in with ie 40 and just
blend out those edges even more with no
additional product at all I swear this
look is so easy you guys I swear it's so
freaking easy it's not even funny how
easy this is but it looks a little
bit intimidating when you first like see
it but honestly if you have the tools
you get the colors you're good to go and
of course i have a code with morphe
brushes
it's mani anyway in all caps and you get
10% off I mean it's a little it's a
little code to little Commission code
you guys don't even use that code if you
guys don't watch it the morphe brushes
already so cost efficient or not like
expensive at all so if you guys are
wanting to save another 10% then go
right ahead and use it and if not it's
all good but edge one leg is know got
the option is there cool so now we're
going to do is we're going to go ahead
and grab a flat brush I'm going to use
the exact blend you 32 by Sigma and then
I'm gonna grab a makeup geek shimma
shimma which is like a very shimmery
champagne
tone and then we're going to toss onto
lid right into the center and this is
what's gonna bring a lot of focus to the
eye and then I'll go in with that same
morphe brush set in four three three and
just kind of blend out those edges a
little bit with no additional product
yeah yeah okay so I went ahead and I
grabbed an eyeliner I'm just grabbing
the one by the balm it's the mr. right
now Dean eyeliner pencil everything that
they do is so cute
I'm just gonna run that in the waterline
as well as underneath the lash line very
lightly I'm gonna go and blend it out
we're going to go in and grab the same
bit and Coco back shadow on the little
pencil brush and we're going to run over
that black with the shadows and then
we're gonna blend out those even more
okay so basically that's it for the eye
let me go and finish the other eye real
quick and I'll be right back
okay cool not only am i both eyes done
is what they look like both eyes done
real now clock me you can't I know can't
clock this bitch I'm gonna use the Too
Faced better than sex mascara old you
look good oh my god Oh thoughtfully got
my scared me it is 7 o'clock and I need
to be at a dinner at 8 and I still have
makeup on help me please
oh I love this mascara I forgot how much
I really liked it really gives you
volume and extension ok cool now we're
for the bottom one we're gonna use the
NYX skinny mascara which is cute little
tiny one and I think it's literally
perfect for the bottom lashes those of
you who are looking forward to me
booking my high think again bitch think
oh good so I'm going to go in with some
falsies of course the falsies I was
wearing in that video where the bleep
you pair number two which give a really
pretty like lifted flare especially in
the center I think that's gonna be great
for this look because we already have a
lot of focus towards the center of the
lid to make it look a little bit more
round and pretty
see all these lashes just really give
you so much extension because they lift
up naturally blinking beyou lashes
honestly you guys like they are the best
mink lashes I've ever used and I've
tried a lot I've been sent a lot of new
clashes and blinking is definitely
definitely definitely my favorite and I
don't know what it is like their styles
are a little bit different than other
pairs their band is super super super
comfortable and they just they just last
a long time I already use this pair like
10 times they look as if I just barely
opened them but they look amazing
I love them and I have a code is
blinking of um g10 and you save 10% I
mean it's cool if you don't use it you
don't have to
anything's out but it's an option there
if you want to save some money on minks
mean pairs are usually like 35 bucks
like mink lashes because they last you a
long time but these ones are 30 and then
you get to save 3 bucks if you use a
code so you get for 27 bucks I've never
I've never seen me glasses sold for $27
ever ever ever ever ever ever I know the
best ones I've ever used so leaky mute
you guys are so good to me honestly you
guys like slay me this is what the
lashes look like holy crap it looks so
ok musical you guys in for a final look
awesome so that way that I look done
let's go ahead just finish the face off
because like I feel like a little bit
weird only having like contour and how
they done so weird so it's going to take
my favorite highlighter of like life
right now d Becca opal highlight by
Becca customary plum and then we're
gonna go and just take a morphe fan
brush we're just gonna dust that into
our highlight areas I love this
highlight because it gives you a really
really pretty golden reflect to it but
it's not my just gold it gives you like
a champagne gold it's not like just like
yellow gold it's like a really beautiful
champagne gold and I feel like it goes
with so many different skin tones
honestly like this is one of my favorite
highlights of life because I feel like
any single person can wear it and its
own beautiful on everyone yes like yes
bitch like yes now that we're
highlighted we're going to go ahead and
do blush and we're going to go ahead and
go in with the Tarte blushing bride
blush which goes like this isn't that
cute named blushing bride like that's so
adorable I want to be a blushing bride
but I'm single it's fun take that on a
morphe g8 brushes this blush is so
pretty
does it give you just a nice glow from
within kind of blush look it's not it's
not lifes I stopped now we're gonna go
ahead and go in with my NYX can you
guess it can you guess what NYX lip
liner it is it's the NYX peekaboo
neutral lip liner
if I ever find a lipliner that's this
good for this much money like I'll
 follow her and I perfect and
then we're gonna go ahead and go in with
some lipstick obviously we're gonna use
an old combo like one of my favorite
combos I used to do this one all the
time but I just forgot about it and I'm
gonna do for this look because I think
it's perfect
we're going with Gerard cosmetics nude
lipstick which we see like a matte
peachy nude I don't want to keep it this
like peach I'm gonna go in with
buttercup by Gerard as well on top of it
to give it more of a pinky satin lip
this is like a babydoll pink color I kid
you not when I worked on Mac I saw this
combo all the time it would always ask
me what are you wearing oh my god like
that lipstick is so beautiful on you and
I'm always like bully bear with kind of
sexy hmm I think this lip color is the
name I also have some really amazing
Cody Gerard cosmetics right now I have
like a three lipstick bundle you get
