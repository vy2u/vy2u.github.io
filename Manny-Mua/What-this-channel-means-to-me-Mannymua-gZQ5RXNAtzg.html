let's get into it
yeah okay basically what I'm going to do
is talk about what my channel is gonna
be about you know what I mean
actually first of all we're gonna do is
run with some powder on because I know
if I could probably live Halen growth
the whole the vodka I'm back I'm back
you guys yes some powder
I guess not powder so I see what this
channels gonna be basically my whole
life experience I'm not going to be
purely like YouTube tutorial e
walkthrough videos I'm gonna do that a
lot
and I really wanted to do that because I
wanted to teach people how to do makeups
I do on my Instagram because that's
where I get most of my following from
but I also wanted to be informative like
my life and vlogs and fucking rants that
I do you know what I mean because I
don't want it just to be about makeup I
want it to be like I want you guys to
get to know me once you get to know who
I am
cetera et cetera think Maya right now my
background don't fucking pay attention
to that shit I'm moving soon so
everything is just like Baron Margo I'm
surviving my romance about it I can
start my time not comfortable but I
compromise you know I split with me
matters I think things are driving I
hope I can be informative to you guys
what I wanted this channel to be is
basically like a beacon for other gay
men who are in the cosmetic industry
that are like fighting tooth and nail to
be who they are but not being judged and
getting ridiculed and things like that
because I got that I got that a lot you
know I got like that ridiculous accept
etc and growing up was hard for me
because I grew up religious and now I'm
into makeup it was even harder and so I
wanted to be like a beacon a beacon of
hope beacon of hope you know not that
I'm saying that I'm fucking I deserve to
be a beacon of hope I'm not saying that
I figure if I can help someone with my
experience to get through theirs
why not you know I mean so basically the
chitchat ones though I'm talking to
they're gonna be more funny I mean I
mean straight up they're gonna be more
funny than the ones I'm teaching how to
do a smoky eye you know it'll be like
they're just gonna naturally be my board
gear right now not gonna be as funny
because I'm just not gonna be as funny
when I'm going right there I'm trying to
concentrate on that blending in that
cream it's just not you know what I mean
so be picturing me I'll be patient on my
channel um I'm still learning about
everything learning how to editing odd
stuff so I don't really know what I want
to get into yet
with how I'm editing and how I'm doing
my videos so just be patient with me I'm
sorry I keep looking to the viewfinder
that is the hardest part of the whole
thing notes that voiceovers hardest
battle everything else looking into the
camera lands and not to be fattening
it's hard hope that you guys enjoy my
channel I know I'm fucking crazy like I
know I'm a crazy-ass bitch but I think
that if you find yourself and you don't
give a fuck like this is how I'm with my
friends like I'm just like like a rowdy
ass bitch
people think I'm drunk all the time and
I'm not I don't even drink I don't need
me a drink alcohol but people think I'm
crazy and I think it makes you you be
confident in who you are as a person so
that other people can learn from that
confidence and I'm 23 years old now and
it's been hard it's been hard I've had a
lot of hard experiences growing up
Mormon and finding out my parents when I
was gay and things like that and so it
was tough at first for me and finding
myself was such a huge just aha moment
like of course I'm gonna be this this is
how I'm gonna be like I was gonna be me
you know what I mean and so I think it's
been been great a great experience and I
wouldn't change it for the world and now
that I'm getting into social media I
wanted to share that with people who
needed something I need I wish I had
someone that was there for me but I
learned all my and I was the first child
of three I wanted to be that it's gonna
be okay story you know I mean not that I
had a really tough hard experience I
wasn't kicked out or anything like that
but every person has their own
experience you know what I mean and so
it just depends on what yours is and
whether yours is going to be so I think
it's great if you have so much look up
to you know to me not saying that you I
deserve it
I'm not saying that you know what I mean
but I am saying that if you guys needed
someone there like that's what I'm here
for
that's why I try my hardest to reply to
everyone because it is so refreshing
when someone bigger like then I was on
my Instagram or bigger than me I had
like 100 K would reply to me and I would
just feel like wow this person like took
the time out to reply to me I look up in
first and then they reply to me I just
think it's great when you can reply to
someone and you they know you're being
genuine and I really genuinely wanted to
be there for you guys
and I love you guys so thank you so much
for all the support
can't wait to continue to make videos
this channel is just going to be
basically my life experiences and the
tutorials I go through
and what I want you guys to know about
me hope you guys like it and I hope you
guys are ready for this journey cuz it's
not gonna stop
so yeah I'm ready for cuz it's armed oh
my god
for I almost went in with my brother
Mike Carolyn bronzer I was about AG like
this man in this fucking she does HD
understand my imperfection is thoughtful
you're gonna see lashing they're gonna
see Nagi you're not naughty naughty like
I'm not gonna be purely to to to to bit
yeah
so it's gonna be about that shit you
guys don't know everything
mm-hmm I get all grid it's hard to look
into the camera
I rather look at myself in the
viewfinder you know I'm lost involved
and I lied to another blinding because
it's nighttime now I go to my soft boxes
and those fucking in pain don't anything
I'm sweating I'm sweating Leroy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
