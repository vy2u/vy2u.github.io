today's video is going to be a testing
of a product video I have seen this
product floating around with so much
fucking hype and intensity behind it and
that product is the new Pat McGrath
lipsticks the honeycomb though these are
the new matte trans lipsticks I have the
entire collection here with me and I
really wanted to check them out I've
been seeing so much hype around these
like I was saying earlier and I feel
like everyone's been saying it's like
the world's best lipstick and whenever I
hear things like that or whenever I see
things that are just like so positive
all the time only I'm very just like hmm
I'm very intrigued I'm very fucking
intrigued by that especially like on
social media like you have to take
things with a grain of salt and I just
feel like sure we'll see if these are
really the world's best lipsticks you
know so I wanted to try them out see if
they are something that I really enjoy
or not I have not tried them out yet
they're also in their little gold
packaging so yeah guys that's a sales
video is going to be it's going to be a
review on the Pat McGrath lipsticks as
always if you guys do like this video if
you guys do not like me please don't
fucking watch it you know the Jo with
dang key but if you guys do like this
video please subscribe to my channel if
you're not already and if you're new
what's up I'm Manny anyway and welcome
to my channel
thank you so much for being here I
really appreciate it ok so let's just
jump right in let's see these really are
the best lipsticks in the world we'll
see let's see they're not so these guys
are sold on the sephora website and they
retail for a pack of 3 for $95 which i
think is a pretty buggin empty as Benny
uh-huh one lipstick retails for $38 so
let's read what it is specifically it
says a richly pigmented lipstick that
adorns lips in a lightweight veil of
opaque color for a modern matte finish
fashion was essentially surrealist
golden let the destined to be the cult
status basically it's mostly be a
high-end lipstick for a high-end price
point so we're gonna go ahead and take
the skin show lust Metron so this is
like the nude collection basically we're
gonna open now I think it's cute I may
be wrong I think it's like a very
different unique way of packaging but
it's such
a mess and makes me really hit noise
actually like I don't like to open
except getting nervous it's gonna spill
buck see a couple went down a couple
down so you know three lipsticks right
here they come in their own little
individual baggie we have ami oh me oh
my flesh 3 and 1995 each of them have a
little sticker that shows what exact
shape so let's go ahead open these bad
boys up oh okay this is fucking
sickening this is a beautiful ass
component oh my god it's like a medal
with a really pretty gold lips we're
gonna take the shade a 19 and 95 okay
are you the world's most overhyped
lipstick I hope not but if you are okay
so this is the park pushed up all the
way each of the lipsticks come with 0.2
14 ounces they are made in Italy Maine
Italy it makes it fucking sound rich I'm
very intrigued let's see okay
okay I'm impressed so far so this is one
layer of a 1995 right here as you can
see it is definitely full coverage full
pigness as it was going on if felt very
nice it felt very lightweight on my lips
right now it does feel very very very
light it's not like a heavy feeling
lipstick I definitely would not say that
this is a matte lipstick kate matte
lipstick by any means the way that this
looks in the tube I'm like wow that's so
mad holy fuck that's some bad as fuck
but on the lips it's not as mad as I
thought was gonna be it's actually a
little more of a satin finish it gives
you a budge it's very very comfortable
let's try the shade
ami these are so pretty like the way
they just they have a very just unique
look like no shine whatsoever is coming
off of these okay so that was literally
a one two full fucking coverage god damn
this is the shade o me or om I Tommy
same exact consistency as the other
shade it is a very very lightweight full
fucking coverage so I was thinking that
it was gonna be so Matt like I thought
it was gonna look like this
on the lips I really did it does not
look this matte on the lips whatsoever
but I'm sure let me see yeah so this is
definitely the type of matte lipstick
that will 100% transfer if you're gonna
kiss someone if you're gonna eat
something if you're gonna eat someone
hey I don't know your fucking life it's
definitely going to transfer a little
bit so just be cautious of that and last
but not least of the entire nude said we
have the shade flesh 3 wears actually
the darkest of the three oh shit
it feels identical to other shades like
literally exactly the same feels nice
and lightweight I have no complaints
whatsoever so far so good on the nude
shades so now let's go ahead move on to
the brights and now for the bright
collection oh that was a good fucking
ribbed you see that Wow that's all
fucking good we're gonna take the shade
Elson e LS o n our first bright okay L
so let's see what you got buddy it
almost feels better than the last ones
so we have Elson right here this one
actually felt a little bit different
than the other shades did this one felt
a lot more creamy and then the other
ones it I felt like this one actually
looks a little bit more shiny than the
other a flesh tone shades did I think
the color itself a stunning it's like a
beautiful blue toned red it looks
beautiful however this is definitely
much more of a satin creamy finish than
it is matte for sure did you see how
that fucking applied how creamy that was
God that she almost made me sick with
how nice that was perfect so what do we
got next we have the shade obsessed
excavation point so we have obsessed
right here which is a really intense
bright orange coral let's go ahead and
swatch this one how are these swatching
so fucking what is in here okay so this
shade feels identical to the last bright
shade not the nude ones the last bright
one this one again has a lot more give
it's much more of a satin finish it's
not as mad as the other shades are but
it is stunning the coverage was
beautiful no streaks whatsoever the
color looks fucking great okay obsessed
I'm obsessed well it's nice it fits
Bernay we can't do any better so now
we're going with the shade full panic
ever I like Manic Panic so we have a
brightest fuck hot hot pink what it's
just so crazy how matte they look on the
tube but on the lips they have such a
satin finish I don't understand let's
see okay so this one it feels more like
the nudes and this is the shade a full
panic it's a hot intense ass fuchsia
full
ass coverage right away again just like
all the other shades were this one feels
more matte like the nude ones did than
the other previous hot intense colors
which I really like because I feel like
this actually is more true to name to
the Matt trance name I feel like this is
more of a matte a modern matte finish of
course let me see if I kiss my land
again hella I never wear the pink like
this is like really weird for me to see
and now we have one more so first one to
go in with the shade antidote which is a
beautiful like right it's like a bright
plum okay something okay okay that's
washed a little weird it could be mate
okay I'm gonna start it off I'm starting
it on my hand first
I'm sweating on my hand let's see now
and here we have antidote this is the
shade right here um is actually talking
because I feel like usually I feel like
colors like this and make my teeth look
super yellow and I'm always like I'm
alone to care about these colors but
this one doesn't make my teeth look at
that bad so this one it felt a lot more
like the nude shade so I had much more
of a tug then the bright shades did so
this one definitely gives you much more
of a matte feeling going on however it
is still pretty shiny on the lips it
definitely looks like as if it is not a
full matte lipstick but I'm not obsessed
like this one I'm just not that obsessed
with like the way it went on I'm not
obsessed with the way it looks on the
lips I'm not obsessed with let me just a
personal thing exactly love purple
lipstick so mmm personal thing now
obsessed with this one my lips are
burning only two more now I'll take the
shade who isn't stunning Micke shade
mcmenamy's mcmenamy's
mmm this was slightly more patchy than
the other ones aren't hey mom what's up
yes I am this one I would say is
slightly more streaky than the other
shades are I don't how to apply two
layers two to three layers to get it
full opacity but it could also be
because my lips are very very like raw
right now and it just like they don't
want to take any more lipstick on the
lips at all once you get the layers down
the two or three layers I feel like the
coverage is full coverage it's beautiful
it looks really really nice on the lips
but I definitely had to build this one
up to be full coverage and to make sure
there was no like up my skin peeking
through even though I still feel like
there's little spots of great they're
not in the Sun or anything but went on
very smooth very creamy okay guys so we
are now down to the last one and my lips
are so happy and ready to be gone with
this they're very excited so we're gonna
take the shade deep void that's a hot
fucking sound show you so this one looks
black we have a black lipstick okay so
this is definitely not black this is
deep dark fucking purple glides on so
good okay guys so this is the shade deep
void which I love the shade name I don't
really like shades like this these are
just not my thing I think they look a
little funky on me my whole mouth is so
red right now from like wiping off and
putting all these lipsticks on wet on
extremely creamy it has more of a satin
finish than the other mats do and I
think now we have the final verdict to
see whether or not the matte trans
lipsticks by Pat McGrath are overhyped
or not okay guys that's it for today's
video so what is my final verdict do I
think that these are overhyped so I
think that they're nice what do I think
about this lipstick formula I think that
they are actually not overhyped I think
that they are absolutely beautiful they
are definitely one of the nicest
lipsticks I've ever worn ever the price
point is definitely a little bit high
but that's just honestly how it is when
you come to high-end products you know
like why sell lipsticks Tom for
lipsticks they're expensive but they are
nice quality just like how this one is
this is $38 but the quality is so nice
they're definitely not as mad as I
thought they were going to be though
that is like one thing I was kind of
confused about I'm like this is much
more
Saten and creamy feeling then hey Matt
lipstick does like even on my lips right
now and that's with blotting on my hand
once it still looks very very satin and
does not look very matte to me not just
my personal opinion I guess honest to
god these are actually really worth it
I'm shocked like I think that they're
actually really really pretty really
nice and definitely worth the hike so if
you guys can I would definitely get your
hands on them definitely more so the
nude shades for sure the bright ones are
really nice as well the dark ones I'm
not a huge fan of they will probably
like get all over your face to be quite
honest because they are so creamy
of course I'll leave these lipsticks
down below if you guys are interested to
check them out you guys thank you guys
