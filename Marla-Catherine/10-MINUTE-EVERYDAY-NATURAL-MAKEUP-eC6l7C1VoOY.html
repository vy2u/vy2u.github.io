I wore that for three hours and there
was there anything hey guys it is Marla
and today I'm going to be showing you
how to do this look so it took about 10
minutes exactly because I tie myself I
was like really legit and everything so
this look is perfect for back to school
because we always wake up late we're all
tired but we still want presentable so
this is my 10 minute makeup look I think
you guys didn't do it and let's just get
right on into the video so on camera I'm
going to come up with a 10 minute makeup
look and I even have a timer that about
to set my phone and I'm trying to do
this you know that's a school like July
ok let's get started
oh by the way if you guys like my shirt
or this is one of two forty centimeters
down so but this little like silver
thing right that is my mirror so let me
hit the timer make sure to play
collegiate there you guys see that
there you'll find 10 minutes isn't
working out so I'm going to take some
extra of it some CC cream an apple
concealer this one's mine ours you guys
get the Maybelline fit me cuz I heard
that that works does the same putting
goodbye not next time so anyway I mixed
up the two together dang I really
scratch myself I hurt so I abandoned mix
the two together and I notice with donek
blemishes I can feel a pimple farming
right there like does anyone else have a
husband work next feel your pimple
forming okay so I'm back with and head
abandon because my hair was bugging me
and it has we always and I read your
eyes to make you look awake because
waking up for school early can do some
damage and then I'm taking my big letter
you can eat your finger if you want and
I am blending it that out getting that
pimple still still showing wear
sunscreen kids we see you see this this
looks painful
I said I'm an eclipse so the key to make
your skin look good even though you
didn't like so now much time on it is
bronzing and bronzing and bronzing like
I come to you it works I don't allow my
brushes so I just take a super fluffy
flush big brush that we can maximize
their space and I'm going to take my
school bronzer I'm almost out and I'm
really sorry
okay I'm good well it takes a buttload
of that I'm going to focus it on your
like regular places where you would
regularly broth but then I'm also going
to kind of smear all over my face
because we're salt on white and I don't
want to be white by the way it sums up
if you guys like this kind of casual
background is that I mean that's like a
clothing rack left my desk and there's a
plant and also since I concealer still
is like on the lighter side so now what
I prefer I also just like to stand out
over that smear that's a really weird
word I always film with like my windows
open so everyone can only see in and a
lot of times a box like throw up and so
people are probably like what is going
on and then my mom also got me this hat
so I think it's official you don't have
I had about it and control down your
arrows on the timer oh I have five
minutes left
okay so I spent five minutes on my
makeup and it's because I was talking
and I forgot I was into timer that is
really it for the skin and so I'm now
gonna move on to eyebrows and eyebrows I
think should be the focus of your lips
and your makeup looks complete I'm on a
time I was I doing
okay so eyebrows I think you should
focus on the most because when use your
eyebrows done it just makes the makeup
look look so much more completed and if
you actually spent a lot of time in it
so the way to make your eyebrows was
done that super fast is by filling in
the arch and extending the towel and my
just filling in sparse areas it does not
on to be an Instagram brow probably will
view it more on the natural side it
because that's what I prefer but it's
also a lot quicker but like just right
there my arrows are already almost done
and then I do it to do poof and then I
do it to the other one to stay nice good
flavors up this is like so first we need
to make it with the time two minutes and
30 seconds and now for eyeshadow I'm
just going to use the little bronzer
like I said when you love tanning or
eyebrows are done like you just look so
much better and it doesn't take too much
time I'm going to take a super fluffy
brush and put that all over it and then
put it all over my lid summary Keane
does this all the time after I got it
from and I'm telling you I love it no
good one minute okay then I'm going to
put on mascara because one minute how is
an immense will sue any so focus on the
roots that will make your eyelashes with
stickers and then brush it over the tip
and that's all you can dear maskers to
suppress oh my god what my makeup is
complete
kind of so I think I was presentable
enough to go to school it was ten
minutes and I'm done I got my eyebrows
done
so it's lumpy a little not really but
kind of wide you getting so much so this
is what you can do it when you are
running late you only have about termina
to your makeup so basically a lorry top
is only use concealer instead of doing a
full face of light foundation then
bronze yourself because when you bronze
yourself your skin looks so much better
and glowy and so that completes this
video I hope you guys liked it and it
was on the shorter side but you know I
guess that's good because no one wants
to see me too much and that's about it
Oh way to go might have been oh yeah
comment down below when you guys start
school and I love to us to your comments

that's what I taught in my next video
