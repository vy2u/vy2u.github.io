what I normally do for my school days I
always wake up like once school starts
hey guys it is Marlon today we're gonna
be doing like I'm gonna I think it's
child at ten minute that readies me for
school if you're like running late but
it's like 10-15 minutes because after
like you eat and going off it anyway but
it's about ten minutes so I'm going to
show you a five minute makeup look and
my go-to hairstyle that takes less than
five minutes and I did not say in the
video but if you need any outfit ideas
for it when you're anyway just go watch
a few my look books are pretty short and
like to the chase I'll have a few a link
down below and without further ado let's
get on into the studio do not sound good
I'm setting my timer for five minutes
cuz I'm going to be doing it five minute
makeup look today and go okay five
minutes so first up is you always
moisturize because that makes your skin
look so healthy and glowy even when it's
really not I feel like it's a lot easier
to do glowy makeup looks in a short
amount of time than it is to do mat
looks to go ahead and stick with that I
just get concealer altogether when I'm
doing when I'm in a rush because I feel
like I just end up looking cakey when I
do it too rushed so I'm just gonna skip
the bronzer and I'm watching your face I
think it's super important because it
just makes you look better and this is
one my favorite bronzer it's just a 4-1
I just saved a little bit of bronzer
everywhere and I just hoped you look a
little bit more alive and healthy now
I'm gonna go to blush and blush is my
favorite thing ever it makes your skin
look so good and I'm gonna show you a
big fluffy brush for this this is but
also one of my favorite blush pellets
I'm all out and I'm just getting those
teeth back on the apples of my cheeks
and bring it up you don't want to look
like a doll but I feel like when you do
put on blush it helps you it makes your
skin look very natural looking healthy
okay now that is all done basically skin
is done it open up tamari but have to
spray it not two minutes what
and then you're gonna go ahead and curl
your lashes put on some brown eyeliner
this on your waterline and pop more oh
and you're just gonna kind of let that
sit and then I'm gonna quickly take I
even have time for this pair up the
amount of stress this is causing me is
not even worth it and then put this onto
my eyebrows and I fill in the arch and
brush it out honestly it would just be
easier to not wear makeup so I'm then I
pull it in a little on the inner corner
and I skip brow gel then you have extra
time like me at 40 seconds an entire 40
seconds even for mascara that completes
my 5 minute makeup look I have an entire
20 seconds left you have time to go like
watch a TV show
ok so the 5 minute makeup look is done
honestly like unless there's actually
cute guys at your school but is it even
matter so for the 5 minute here I'm
gonna show you guys my literally I wear
this every single day to school it's
just my trademark
I wear always wear a low ponytail or a
low bun sometimes if I do have time I'll
call some pieces around my face I'm
going to quickly show you guys how to do
that because it makes you look somewhat
put together and it's super quick I'm
hanging up my straightening no hurry i'm
hurry I'm hanging up at my curling iron
right now and you do that first that way
while you're done doing the ponytail you
are able to curl your pieces that's it
go I'm going to use a scrunchie cuz
scrunchies are so cute and they're super
easy and you just gather her hair and
you're gonna comb I like to do the
finger comb look it just looks cuter in
my opinion and I took my bang so many
ears and then you're gonna take your
scrunchie and you just do one two and
then the third time I only do it halfway
and then you can flip it up like make it
look nicer and then DUP pull on your
hair to make it look looser oh so now
you have your like a little low bun I'm
gonna go in and you take some pieces
right up the front up here you're gonna
pull them out and then pull out a piece
like down here and though they're gonna
be the piece
that you curl great so in awesome pieces
I'm going to take my curling iron and
I'm just gonna very loosely it curl them
I don't like them to do them break tight
I'm just gonna figure calling them to
make sure they look good and then I do
have bangs and so I embody thin them to
the back of my ears that way they stay
in place and not finishes off at the
hairstyle my timer I saw my entire at
minute and 30 seconds so you've been
probably squeezing a granola bar or
something a low bun kind of ballerina
low bun ish look and a very quick makeup
look and I'm gonna now show you guys my
outfit okay so this is the outfit my
shirt is from brandy melville and then
my eye pencil thrifted if you did not
choose out your off with the night
before then you can only just do the
classic combo of a t-shirt and jeans and
maybe like a layering sweater or coat or
some what and then just some basic
commerce commerce and my favorite they
never go wrong
I wear them like every day anyway so and
then my backpack to feel all of them
clunking I love it a lot
