like English boy I gotta take those hi
guys I'm Marla yeah today I'm filming a
10 summer must-haves so today is all
about the things you need to have an
awesome summer well you obviously don't
have to have these to have an awesome
summer but they definitely help so if
you guys end up liking this video I'm
thinking of doing a summer bucket list
video and so if you guys want that I
think if this video a thumbs up and that
lets me know to float one I can't really
link very well number one on the list is
the say Tropez tanning lotion and if you
guys do not know what this is is
probably the best thing I've ever used
to when it comes to tanning because
that's a trip a tanning there I know
that they have like the mousse that you
put on and you leave on overnight and
that's awesome and all but I love this
tanning lotion because it's something
gradual and you just put it on everyday
as a lotion and over time you get tanner
and so it doesn't look as suspicious
when you go from five shades darker over
a number two is hair scars like like
it's starting to pick up a little bit
more but I'm so happy about this because
I love them so much I'm actually wearing
one right now hair scarves make your
hair look so much cuter it's ridiculous
how little effort you put into your hair
when you use them but then I make your
hair look so cute so you can just tie
them up like how I did almost like a
bandana you could put them in your
ponytails you can braid them into your
hair especially when you don't want to
put that much effort in your hair during
the summer this just helps you look so
much more put together okay the next one
I have on my list is a nice sturdy pair
of sandals and I'm not talking about
like the ones from Old Navy just the
little flip-flops like just a good pair
of sandals I have Birkenstocks and I
know that Birkenstocks are not the
cheapest things ever but they last so
long and they are so good and they're
such good quality and they look cute
they have so many different styles but
you can just at least get one pair of
good sandals where you feel like you can
go to during the summer you can just
throw them on and not really care you
know everyone needs a fanny pack whether
you want to agree we're not you need a
fanny pack like fanny packs I feel like
are so underrated they are the best
things ever I wear mine all the time I
wear it to the store I wear it when I go
like on bike rides I wear it I've worn
it to school before it's just such a
neat especially for the summer when you
don't want to get like the
backpack straps on and then you get all
sweaty you know just fanny packs are so
convenient and I know there's like
plenty of cute ones I just have a simple
black Patagonia one the next thing is a
sunscreen moisturizer and I would
recommend the hope in a jar one this one
works so well and it's just having
sunscreen during the summer is obvious
like an obvious thing that you need to
have but I feel like a lot of us forget
to put on sunscreen but make sure you
guys are putting on sunscreen in like
some sort of form or way you know the
next thing I have on my list is a
Polaroid camera and this one's kind of
optional obviously you don't need this
but like I think having like physical
physical memories are the best things
ever and just having a little cute
picture if you have a bonfire with your
friends bring your Polaroid camera take
a picture if you're just going on a hike
if you're just swimming in a pool like
bring your Polaroid camera take you
pictures and then you can look back on
that because I think it'll be so cute to
have like a summer Polaroid album so
then the summer you can look back and
see all their physical copies of
memories so okay the next one is a cute
water bottle this is something that I
always talk about but I never do I still
have yet to buy it just a cute water
wall but drinking water super-important
and during the summer since it's always
hot and you need to stay hydrated and
having a cute water ball will help you
to stay motivated to drink more water my
nose is itchy why is so itchy okay the
next one is nail polish and this is
something that I myself I I do not do
this but I need to start doing it more
paint your nails even I would recommend
getting like a nice solid gel nail
polish and then just wearing that and
since you're always wearing sandals
having your toes like look groomed it
just looks much more better the next
thing is one cute swimsuit just having a
good go to swim see where you can feel
confident in and something you can feel
like you're cute when you're swimming
cute like why it's like cute so the
memory card filled up we want to go
change it Evelyn you forgot to turn on
the microphone so we just record like
okay I'm back and better than ever I
know to say now you know definitely
finding a swimsuit you feel confident in
and you feel like you know I look soggy
when I get off the floor I'm not gonna
lie I look like a chihuahua but when I
have a cute swimsuit it helps you know
it helps you feel put together the next
one is getting a portable Bluetooth
speaker how can you live without that
thing ah my favorite brand for portable
speakers is JBL not sponsored I own a
lot of speakers from them and they are
my all-time favorite speakers ever super
good sound quality and they just they're
really reliable why do I keep on using
the example of a blog part but you can
go like to bonfire and you have a nice
speaker to play some wax music I feel
like music changes can change the entire
setting of an environment okay and then
the last one is this an extra I had
another one but I completely forgot what
I was gonna say sorry yeah if I remember
I'll put it link it down in the
description box or something that's so
annoying it's okay you know it's just
life life sometimes I see
I didn't even plug it in you're kidding
no you like you'll still hear your audio
but you're fired the microphone picked
that up and then the last but she'll
just restart the entire video I'm at it
anyway and then the last thing is just
to get out there just to be active and
to work out I feel like when you work
out you just everything is better I'm
not even gonna lie yeah you know
sometimes it sucks when you're actually
working out in the moment it sucks but
you feel so much better about yourself I
was gonna say oh bug repellant Roo make
sure you wear that - hey I'll see you
guys in my next video this was a little
crazy a little all over the place a
little ratchet but you know it's just
part of life sometimes life is a ratchet
anyway I'll see you guys my next one
make sure to follow me on Instagram and
all those fun stuff I'm gonna be having
some me ups throughout the summer so
make sure you guys go ahead and follow
me on Instagram for more details about
that and yeah I'll see you guys my next
one see you guys my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
