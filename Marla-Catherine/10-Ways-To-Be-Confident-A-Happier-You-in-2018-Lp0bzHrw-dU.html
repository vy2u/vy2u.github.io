the microphone on but then we caught
that hey guys it is Mariela
okay so it today I'm gonna be filming a
little bit of a different video from
your channel it's gonna be more advice
II I don't think that's a word but I
just made it up so but I'm gonna be
giving you guys basically ten tips on
how that's five I'm gonna be giving you
guys like ten tips on how to be more
confident and just how to feel better
about yourself and all that fun stuff
that we all struggle with whether you
guys end up following these tips are not
just know that you've been fool in your
own way and know that I struggle just as
much as you guys do so I don't know I
feel like a lot of people think that you
towards are just immune to this or
celebrities or whatever famous people
because we're not immune to
self-confidence problems and other
problems so make sure that you guys and
let me know if you guys like this by the
way I designed a t-shirt and I'll have a
link down to it down below I'll have
more information about that the end of
the video but other than that let's get
on it to it okay so when it comes to
confidence I feel like most of the time
we're talking about our physical
appearance but it can also be like your
personality you're not confident in or
just other things you know you're not
very confident just in general you're
not confident yourself and I feel like
no matter who you are or how attractive
someone may appear everyone deals with
that and I think that once you figure
that out and remember that everyone's
human things start to get better I was
talking to my friend the other day about
like confidence in this thing and or
maybe I was watching a youtuber I don't
know
everyone is so self-conscious about
themselves that all they're focused on
is themselves and they don't really have
time to really like look at other people
does that make sense so when I'm in the
halls and I'm self-conscious of my
Herricks I'm having a bad hair day I'm
not paying attention to the other girl
that's walking by that's also having a
bad hair day cuz I'm so focused on
myself tip number one is to work out so
I feel like working out is something
that a lot of people don't do because
either they're lazy they just don't have
a desire to do it or whatever but I
promise you guys once you actually start
to work out you guys will just feel so
much better about yourselves when you
work out I actually have a blog and I
lunched it so go ahead and check that
out but I wrote a blog post about
working out I basically talked about how
when I work out it's not that I
necessarily look different after
but I feel different like I feel a lot
better there's like a chemical in your
brain that when you work out it like
releases that chemical and that makes
you happier and so the more you work out
the happier we'll be and you can also
see just a healthy change in your body
my second tip is to drink water okay so
I tried doing the gallon a day challenge
and that didn't work for me at all when
you're hungry it actually means you're
thirsty most of the time so try drinking
water and then like go eat obviously if
you're still hungry when you drink more
water you also notice that your skin
clears up and that your just everything
feels healthier tip number three is to
eat healthy and this goes along with
like the working out drinking water the
quote you are what you eat is so true
because if you're eating Twinkies and
Ding Dongs you're gonna feel like you're
Twinkies anyway honestly what you what
you put into your body is what you're
gonna get out so if you're putting a lot
of a greasy and oily food into yourself
you're gonna know so your skin is
starting to get worse and your hair
doesn't feel as healthy so make sure
that you guys are trying your best to
eat healthy and not dieting but just
making it a lifestyle okay my fourth tip
is to quit talking negatively about
yourself and this is something that I
struggle with a lot if you're gonna ask
my friends at school like a lot of time
I pick I look still bad today or my
hair's not returning out or just have a
bad skin day when I say that it just
makes me feel worse about myself so I
definitely have a lot of insecurities
about myself but I noticed and when I
don't talk about them I just don't focus
on them so much for example I am
self-conscious about something I'm not
gonna say it because I don't want you
guys to like now think about that anyway
but I said when I was self-conscious of
with my friend group and then my friends
were like well now that you say that we
kind of noticed it but we didn't even
notice that before obviously you see
yourself in the mirror every day and
you're like pinpointing all this stuff
you don't like like other people aren't
noticing that anyway so just stop
talking negatively about yourself and
then you'll notice a difference in your
mood
tip number six is to not wear as much
makeup I know this can be a super touchy
subject because a lot of people say that
they put on makeup because it's fun to
do and I totally get that
I'm never probably be that good of
makeup so I just you know like
nikkietutorials and Rachel can't you
they're so good that but that's not me
so I when I say wear less makeup I mean
in a good way as like accepting your
natural beauty more than covering it up
tip number seven is to wear comfortable
clothes and what I mean by this I'm the
type of person that likes to be modest
and not only do I like to be modest
because I just that's me I'm always so
much more comfortable like I see other
girls I'm in school that wear these off
the shoulder tops crop tops jeans that
are too tight just sore things in
general are just people wearing clothes
that I can tell that they're not
comfortable in because they're
constantly going like this and like
pulling down the shirt playing up their
pants and you can tell that that's like
what they're constantly focused on like
whenever I've want something that is a
little too short for my liking or
something I'm so self-conscious of that
like I'm constantly fixing it adjusting
it and it's honestly just really
annoying I feel a lot more
self-conscious of myself but when I wear
something that I know I feel good in and
confident in and I'm comfortable in I
don't even like think about my outfit
you can it be so cute while still being
comfortable so I thought to look books
on my channels and go check those though
you can still be comfy and cute but just
focus on comfy part because that's all
that matters tip number eight is to self
tan when I'm more tan I wear less makeup
and I just feel better about myself so
if you're pale like me try out self
tanner
it works miracles if you guys are
interested in like self tanning this is
the one that I use and it's the st.
Tropez self tan classic and this is sold
at Ulta and then it's use it with this
tanning mitt and I just put it on like
before I go to bed and then I sleep with
it and then I shower in the morning and
then you're gonna go and it lasts like
about a week depends on how much your
shower
I just do that when I'm feeling super
pasty and it always helps so maybe try
that out
see if it works for you guys okay tip
number nine is to invest in your skin
care in your hair care I've tried out
lots of different skin care products and
I found that the ones that work for me
the most is the glossy a milky jelly
cleanser and then the milk matcha toner
in the scrub that always clears up my
skin and it is a little bit more
expensive but it lasts me a while and it
always clears up my skin so I think
that's totally worth it so definitely
try and invest into your skincare and
invest in your hair care too so maybe
take some hair vitamins try not to use
heat on it as much brush it just do that
stuff even focusing on your posture
something that I struggle with is like I
slouch a lot but when I stand up
straight it looks like I'm confident
myself and so it's kind of like the
quote fake it to make it so if you stand
up straight it just looks like you're
confident and then people think you're
confident and then you start to become
more confident and all that good stuff
okay so my last tip for you guys tip
number 10 is to say something good about
yourself every day even on the days that
you feel like nothing is going right say
something good or say something you're
grateful for or say something a feature
that you like about yourself so I like
my ears don't we think it can be good I
don't know try it out and do it for
about a week and see how you feel I have
a bonus tip for you guys because you
guys are awesome one of my favorite
quotes is by Elder dieter Dwarf I have a
hard time saying his name he's German so
I yeah anyway but I have my quote up in
my wall so I'm looking at it as I read
it but says as we lose ourselves in the
service of others we discover our own
lives and our own happiness and I
totally think this is a hundred percent
true when you're getting ready in the
morning let that be the time of the day
where you are focused on yourself but
after that when you leave the house and
you go to school and you go about your
day try focusing on others and same time
to make other people's days better over
time you'll just notice that by making
other people's lives better
it makes your own better I love that Co
so much I have it on my pegboard in my
room and I try to look at it a lot and
apply it into my life just quit focusing
on yourself
and start focusing on how you make other
people's lives better and in doing so
you'll find that your own life becomes a
lot better anyway I think that wraps up
