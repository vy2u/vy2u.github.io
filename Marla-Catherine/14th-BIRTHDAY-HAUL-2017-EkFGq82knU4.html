going to be a haul a not but not just
any haul it's a 14th birthday haul this
is all requested well I actually have an
Instagram like do you guys want a
birthday well and vlog and all of you
guys well a lot of you guys said yet and
so I'm so excited to share this and so
try it I'm so excited to like show you
guys the stuff that I got first off I've
had a bunch of disclaimer in there I
know there's gonna be those dumb people
are like you're bringing I'm not
bragging so please don't take it away
oh yeah is it so I'm going to start off
with some Omega products and I went to
so I'm gonna start off with Sephora so
supported it's good it's good great okay
so the first two things are going to
quickly show because they're just basic
um there are two good cards so wanted to
Taco Bell and I got this from my really
good friend Brenda Lee and she is in my
last vlog experiment oh look it and then
this one is from for JC Penney's and I
like getting JC Penney's cos gift cards
because Sephora is inside of JC Penney's
so three Sephora gift cards anyway so
thank you so much grad and Brinley I
love good cards because it gives you
like freedom to choose what you want so
it's the modern renaissance palette and
I'm so excited about this I born this
every single day since I bought in it
and I've not I am so obsessed with the
colors I found out about this from
Rachel Kent you and I know it's been
around for like a year and a half but I
just really thought out about it and
I've been loving every single color here
it's so pretty I highly highly recommend
if you guys are considering getting it
it's so awesome and then a next product
from Sephora I bought for myself will
live next to items
um so this first one is not the
full-sized version but like the half
side version of the tube a hangover
primer I think like the second time I
insist I did put it in a makeup tutorial
and that will be uploaded soon on my
channel or maybes already uploaded I
don't know when it's going up anyway so
go check it out and the last min from
Sephora was the NARS radiant creamy
concealer and Ivan so another face it's
fill pellet we're gonna blend in a
wall-like
okay I love how full coverage it is
super buildable I just I love this so
much I so nice to be able to like wear
like a BB cream and then just on my neck
like actual blemishes I'll go and put on
this concealer and loving doing that
because it feels so much more lighter on
my skin so the next makeup products are
from Lodi I am so excited I thought it
was glossy err for a long time and then
I got corrected so glossy a so I'm so
sensitive packaging and by far the
cutest company I've ever seen and they
did send this to me and I'm still kind
of them it wasn't for my birthday or
anything it just happened to come on my
birthday and the Perseid I have some
skincare products and this is very
glossy a milky a jelly cleanser and it's
a conditioning face wash vanity next
product is the glossy a priming
moisturizer and I kind of now regret
buying The Hangover one because I just
got a full-size one that's wrong hon but
I'm going to see how that you compare
and we're trying like better but I use
it once and I'm wearing it right now and
it feels very lightweight so I really
like that I they sent me to choose their
cloud paint the first color is pub this
is a pretty pink you will ever use like
I promised you
and then the last cutter from Wacha is
there boy brow and it's not the regular
boy Bob this is in the color clear
transparent and I love it because it's
so easy to like hang your eyebrows so
maybe showing you guys a few items I got
from shop lucky B and I have been
obsessed this company so this first
thing is this sparkly black jumpsuit and
it's just such a comfortable thing to
wear I'll insert some pictures of me
wearing it or you can just go check out
my Instagram it's at Milan Catherine's
and I posted with them anyway it's most
comfortable jumpsuit you will ever wear
and it's so like classy and elegant like
you can wear at night or you can wear it
during the daytime it can be styled both
ways and I love it then the next two
items wear these pins and I look and I
also succeed everywhere and I just love
cleaning them my only jeans or shirt
jean jackets backpack so the first one
is the burn book pin and I think this is
so funny and iconic from like the Mean
Girls movie and then the next one is
sriracha sauce and my parents literally
put sriracha sauce on everything and so
I gotta wash it off in it so they next
kind of read a my dog is not
Jamie and nuts they know my favorite
knives of all time and so I have 20
bucks so I don't know why people turn so
much for them
I just got them because I love them so
much and they're already almost gone and
I did not get them at too long ago 19's
is just different cost away so the next
item is right here right next to me it
is a fuel Robin clunking and backpack
and I wanted one for the longest time
and so I bought it for myself for my
birthday and I write it in the shade
yellow ocher and it is such a pretty
backpack I'm going to be using it for
this upcoming school year because I'm
going back to Bald school so be excited
to die you're putting an see that go
what's in my backpack tag in Turin July
probably anyway it's such a cute
backpack and I got mine from Urban
Outfitters I wasn't going to get on
Amazon but I hear that some people felt
sale fake ones on there and I didn't
want to risk it so chillin with urban
elders anyway I love it with totally
recommend this backpack is so sturdy and
it's like water group and all good stuff
so the next item is a ukulele
I posted a March favorites and it has
like a rad ukulele in the thumbnail and
I talked about it in my video and that
was its abilities ukulele but it's not
even mind it's my little sisters and I
would steal from her all the time
hey so my parents bought me one for my
birthday and I'm so excited I got my own
Amazon to the Amazon literally fills
everything I got mine in a good neutral
Brown because it's cute and this is just
an equally popular song I'll be Glalie
and it's like it's a really easy
insurance to play so I like it so the
last product of this haul I bought
yesterday actually and I'm no regret so
I got me a new pair I got I and entire I
got myself a new pair of Nikes and my
old ones
we're starting to get a little worn out
with us you'll find I got these more for
outfits like like styling them with
outfits because of morning that's long
time so this is what they look like
they're so light living everything I own
is why I'm so sorry um across the
maurices
um so these are white Nikes I think
which turn start learning these you know
comforts of the women's Nike Tenjin if
anyone knows what these are anyway so
they're q-tip white and I know if any
white shoes is kind of risky but I feel
like if I take care of pair of them so
these are more like running out and
about with the cute office and I
splurged not mental sighs I'm so excited
and this is your cute so I apparently
this is the Nike tan June I'm probably
how's that wrong
so that wraps up my haul and purchasing
