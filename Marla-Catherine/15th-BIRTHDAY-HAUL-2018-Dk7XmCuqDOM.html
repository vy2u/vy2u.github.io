you okay let's do this
hey guys is Marla and to dip hi guys is
Marla and today we're gonna be following
a well today I'm gonna be filming a 15th
birthday whole last year I did a 14th
birthday haul and I want to from now on
start doing that so this is my second
year doing it and I did turn 15 I'm
excited to be 15 since 1 year close to
16 and when you're 16 you can drive so I
bought some stuff for myself and I got
some presents from others and I just
want to say I'm not even gonna really
put a disclaimer because you clicked on
this video expecting to see me showing
this stuff like ah so I'm not bragging
or anything and I just think it's so
lame that people think that but I'm not
and I'm extremely grateful for
everything that I have and I love you
guys a lot and thank you for all the
birthday wishes you guys were
overwhelming and I love all of you guys
thank you so much but without further
ado let's let's get all let's go ok so
the first thing I bought from them is
their new lid start and I got it in the
shade cub and a moon this is what they
look like they are diseased lid starts
basically a liquid eyeshadow I don't
really know how to explain it but I am
obsessed this is the best thing I've
ever used it stays on all day really
liked it and I highly recommend copies
my favorite out of this year but this
one's super good for like a highlighter
and then I got the classic boy brow and
I got this in the shade brown I used to
have it in translucent I like the
translucent but I wanted to be able to
have color so I literally don't even
fill in my eyebrows anymore really I
just put on some of this boy brow and I
love you so much I just feel like it it
doesn't change up my eyebrows too much
but that small change helps so much and
I love it so much so much I love it and
then the last thing I got from them it
was glossy a birthday bond calm god the
birthday once I heard it smells good
plus it's sparkly and it's my birthday
not even know why like this is almost
edible it smells so good if you guys do
not know what starter sauces now I do
from Urban Outfitters I got these
sriracha sauce to go I put this on my
backpack
love it
the next thing I got was this I'm
debating whether or not to make my bio
and Instagram bucket hats and
Birkenstocks cuz that's all I work you
haven't done my fire bucket hat where is
it behind you guys right behind you I if
you guys do not know this bucket hats
are like my obsession and I got this one
because I feel like you can wear it with
a lot of outfits I honestly don't even
care if I look ugly and them I just love
bucket hats they are lifesavers and I
always have a special place in my heart
because they are so cute how could you
not like this America explain I
purchased this back in the Urban
Outfitters in Texas and I used it all up
as complete it says 100% natural
treatment to promote fast healthy hair
growth and I felt like it did it make my
hair a lot more healthier so I
repurchase it I would recommend it it
does smell a lot like essential oil so
if you're not into that then you're
blowing up and like this but I'm fine
with it and I really like it so ok the
next few items I got also from her
banners and the first thing was this
t-shirt I got this t-shirt from Urban
Outfitters and it's just these flowers
and I love plants as you guys know and
then the next t-shirt I got was the
Great Wave painting and if you guys do
not know this I have a painting if you
watch my room tour you know but I have a
painting of the Great Wave in my room
and I'm upset that's one of my favorite
paintings and I got it on a shirt
because why why wouldn't I and then I
purchased one more t-shirt and this one
is like this white washed out yellow and
it has a dragon on it and then the next
thing I got from urban was this is who I
got I got this like nudey pink what
colors this I've been wanting an adidas
t-shirt for like the longest time I
wrote one and I like it it's actually
really soft and it's kind of stretchy so
I got an adidas one this one's like an
emerald green and I love a color green
not much to say but it's cute
okay so the next thing I got I you guys
should expect this by now but I got a
pair of Birkenstocks but they're not the
Arizona style let's see ma re I don't
really own a good black pair of sandals
and Birkenstocks the reason why I love
them is because they actually are really
good quality and they're so comfy on me
feet I've worn them quite a few times
already and they're just a nice neutral
color to go with anything in oh I forgot
to show this with the rest of the
glossier stuff my mama got me this and
it's the glossy au perfume I've been
wanting this perfume for a while and my
mom bought it for me so that's so sweet
furry thank you so much mom I love you
you guys have not smelled this sounds
really good
the next thing you know from a birthday
was this and if you guys do not know
what this is this is a tamagotchi I used
to own one of these when I was like what
11 I was like eight or nine when I last
had two Tamagotchi
I have a very vivid memory of me you and
Sam got walking out of a grocery store
and you're all cleaner coming out to you
at the same time they were like nice
crying it's hungry so when I saw this I
was like I have to get one so I got it
and if you guys don't know what it is
it's basically a virtual pet you just
play it you have to be committed if
you're gonna get one of these you can't
let it die but you have to like feed it
and play with it so closest thing to
getting a dog next up is brandy melville
I got these pants and from there I got
some brandy model pants because I always
need new pants I feel like yeah I wear
the same pair every day and I don't I
don't wear tank tops but I like to
purchase them because then I'll layer
them I like to wear a t-shirt and then I
put a tank top over it I don't know I
think it's a cute look how many people
like it my sister roasts me all the time
for it but I actually think it's cute so
I got these two tank tops and I like to
wear them with long sleeves during the
winters or wear them during the summer I
just think it's cute and yeah those are
cool Brandi the next pieces of item I
got was this dress and I po and posting
an intern photo of this on Instagram so
if you guys want to see that then go
ahead and check our Instagram we'll
probably ventually wear this I
absolutely love a cut of this it just
goes like that now where was I sure like
this and then denim has pockets I
purchased this dress from the star place
and it's just this online boutique so
I'll have that link down below because
they're interested in it anyway it's
super cute I always feel like I also
need new dresses because at church I
wear the same two dresses and I
alternate every week hoping people
forget what I would and then and then
and then I got this to see stuff see it
needs Stussy really know how to
pronounce it I think it's dusty but it's
this hoodie and this is the softest
thing ever so stuff she's basically a
surfer and surf shop brand and they're
based out of Huntington Beach California
and my parents when my mom grew up there
and so anyway I just really love this
brand and then last but not least
oh wait that's not last okay
I'm kind of dumb this is my second
dredge Richard this is a Russian this is
my second Roger this is my second record
I've purchased but I still do not own a
record player but I bought this and it's
the melodrama by Lorde
I own the belly I wish one I still don't
want a record player so maybe one day
I'll get one and then last but certainly
not least my god this I got a Polaroid
camera I gave this one away I gave one
away on Instagram and I bought one for
myself because I've been wanting it for
a while and I have destroyed can or two
so this Polaroid takes that size
Polaroids and they're pretty small but
about this actual Polaroid camera
because it takes these huge Polaroids
and I absolutely adore these I am
swapping these up because I took them
recently but they just have like so many
cute ones they just look so vintage too
and I think that wraps up this whole
that rad that wraps it up that is a wrap
everyone found is it for today's haul
and you so much once again for all the
birthday wishes and love and fun stuff

never at 15 never looks so good mmm I
hope that by next year might when I do a
