Katherine in today's video is actually
going to be in the building I'm just
like man vs. wild take around Dorothy
bro so today's video is actually going
to be a get fit for fall video and it's
just going to be giving you some tips on
healthy snacks healthy treats
um healthy fitness tips life hacks etc
yeah I mean just keep watching if you
want to find out so my first tip is
actually to just drink more water it
keeps you hydrated it makes is you don't
have pimples and it makes it just so you
stay full and it's healthy for you guys
just do it so my little healthy snack is
it sounds unhealthy but it's cheesecake
pudding protein pudding and what you're
going to need is some cottage cheese
some jello cheesecake pudding and you're
gonna take about half a cup of cottage
cheese and put it in your blender or
whatever gonna blend it in and then
about half of the packet of the pudding
mix and then there's a squash it will I
put in a little too much but whatever
you like and like am i running to put in
more milk if you don't like good morning
you know and you're just gonna screw
that on and you're gonna put it in your
blender and I'm just using magic bullet
and you can't shake it if you want more
of that workout like you're try to get
it really fit and then you're just gonna
play pour it into your 60s
she's now what you guys are ready to eat
it
it's really heavenly I love it I mean I
I ate the whole thing
so my next tip is to simply be active
just go outside and run and you can
listen to music while doing it just use
your iPod shuffle or whatever you gonna
use
and I can clip on to your pants or
something and my headphones would not
staying with me does anybody else have
that problem and you could do some yoga
I'm not very good at it and or you could
do push-ups or not and you could do this
like makes up for your other thing so I
like so I'm between two tables and it
did not work out so what I'm wearing is
just my hair is in a braid I'm wearing
my headphones a blue really work out top
and then just simply black leggings from
forever 21 I mean I didn't really have
any stretch pants and then I love these
Nikes that I just recently got and
they're amazing so for this for my next
tip is to get this app and it's that
called a seven-minute workout and has a
ton of just like workouts just to do in
a time deal and it's just amazing and
like I was so surprised about how many
they had we know we are all guilty of
being on our phone late into the night
and then you know it makes it so we
can't really sleep and so the simple
solution to that is to simply do not be
on your phone right before you go to bed
just turn off before you go to bed and
then kind of you know sleep you'll sleep
