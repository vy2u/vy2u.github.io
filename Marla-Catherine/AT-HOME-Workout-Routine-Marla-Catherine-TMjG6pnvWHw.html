basement actually because today I'm
flowing my at home work our teen it's
basically just me showing what I
normally like to do and favorite videos
that I watch online to help me like
workout and my favorite my favorite
workout app drinking lots of water it's
just stuff like that system every day my
I wish I worked out every day this is
what I normally do when I work out at
home and so I hope you guys enjoy this
video if you guys also want to see a
what I eat in a day and you guys can
comment down below and let me know and
now I'm wearing like a super frumpy
t-shirt and stuff like that but this is
as real as it gets because this is what
I always like wear when I work out so if
you guys want to see a Y in a day then
content below and let me know so now
let's just get right - this video so to
start off my workout I like to go ahead
and stretch because I do not want to
pull any muscles by the way none of us
was professional so don't like take it
like I'm not a doctor prescribing this
this is just me doing what I do and what
works for me so I like to do these like
weird side lunges things stretch out my
back just make sure I'm all nice and
lumber it's not the word limber is it
lumber like wood also I'm doing a
fitness vlog series on my vlog channel
to go ahead and check that out I'll have
the link down below but I'm just gonna
basically but basically I'll just be
checking up with you guys on my fitness
goals you can be doing it with me
so after I stretch I like to go ahead
and run it on the treadmill for like
five minutes or something like that and
normally like to run on a speed of seven
and have the ramp up on a 10 and I just
do this to make sure like my blood is
pumping and I'm getting like super
warmed up after I finish running I like
to go ahead and go to YouTube because I
go to the YouTube channel Fitness
Blender a link down to that channel down
below this is not sponsored I'm not
clubbing with them in any way I just
really like their YouTube videos their
free workouts and they always make me
sweat so hard like it's like yeah I
probably sweat my body rate because
these work really well I like to do the
hitch workouts basically they're super
high intensity for a short amount of
time because I get super bored after
working out for like 15 minutes like I
cannot do that so I like to do the
eight-minute ones you don't even have to
do these in your basement you can do
these in your room but I like to just
work on my basement so that it's bigger
but I also died halfway through that
plank that was so hard my favorite part
of the entire workout videos is the
workout complete slide that's the best
thing ever this is my workout outfit of
the day I'm wearing these really cute
like checkered leggings from forever 21
a thrift a t-shirt and some tennis shoes
from Nike I always wear t-shirts that's
just what I wear they feel comfortable
in them
also remember to stay hydrated bottle
flip it benchpress it get swole so since
my 8 minute workouts are not long at all
I like to do something else so I'll
probably do some arm workouts I really
really need help on these like I can
barely do these 10-pound ones like I
literally have noodle arms like it's not
okay so I've been working on the next
favorite app is the 7 minute workout
this is once again not sponsored but
they they basically have these like pre
workouts for you and they're only 7
minutes long and they always make me
sweat so hard and the app is free there
are like upgrades in it but the most
part it's free and I really like this so
it highly recommend it also have a link
down to it down below by the way I'm
super sweaty because I just read oh so
that's about it for today's video I know
it's a little bit on the shorter side
but I don't know what else to include it
workout videos this is all I do make
sure you guys subscribe it give the
video a thumbs up and comment down below
whether or not you work out every day I
don't I wish I did but like I just don't
buy the way off links down to all the
videos that I showed in the video in the
description box and I'll link to my
forever 21 leggings and yeah yeah so I'm
actually designing a t-shirt and I just
finished designing it and it should be
launching pretty soon so get super
excited for that I'll let you guys know
in the future videos like what night is

you and for you guys to see it so let's
