my backpack and I wipe off the sweat off
of my face because I run home get away
from my prison as fast as I can
just kidding hashtag grateful for on
education so I then going to my phone
and I just have to check out my statuses
cuz I'm soul pop wait no and then I cry
because I smacked myself my accident
like I hit my but then I was also crying
because Conan Gracie song is about to
come on and I took some pictures to show
my distress and I took some videos about
it update everyone so after that I
always turn on some tunes that are you
know hit in the fields and really
getting me into the mood so I so this is
my new September playlist I only have
one song but that might change and then
I mostly dance most of the time instead
of actually cleaning so that's why my
rooms always messy you know fun fact and
after we stopped filling this clip like
I stopped clean my room like there was
no more progress and then I accidentally
smacked myself with a hanger again oh by
now I'm storming so I go any eat some
ice cream because what else is delicious
and this is the hilltop one this one
will creeps me out because it tasted so
much like waffles this is not a
sponsored video they just are awesome so
I thought it'd go pull out my homework
and I had so much homework is there
really like the third day school no it's
like the second week but it's so much
homework like I am learning Spanish so
comment down below guys I've been any
tips because a girl
so once I've had enough of my homework
and I got to fed up they didn't
understand it I'd go and I watch some
YouTube cuz that relaxes me and I was
watching Emma Chamberlain I think I'm
saying that wrong but she's so funny
she's so funny
hi can I get one spicy chicken sandwich
dude I'm just a sandwich oh just the
regular that's it thank you so we're
currently at Chipotle I'm currently at
chick-fil-a because our kitchen is
currently underneath of renovation and I
can't really eat there because it's like
upside down right now so I've been
eating out lately and I know that's
probably not the healthiest thing for
you but I know I had ice cream for an
after-school snack and now I'm having
chick-fil-a for dinner and but don't
don't comment any dieting tips because I
already know so I got dinner for one
because I'm one and it's dinner for me
so I got a spicy chicken sandwich
because they're delicious and I'm not
even hungry but I'm being extra for the
video and a second review bra on the
sandwich it comes with two pickles but
I'm not about eating vegetables that's
just is against my religion you know I
like asparagus so then I only eat the
bottom bun cuz honestly
pretty good now I go and wipe off all
the chick-fil-a grease off my face and I
wash it and I make sure everything is
squeaky clean and I did get a I wish
extensions if you guys want to see that
vlog on that love it linked down below
and then I'm really cringey and I look
like I'm like what do I look like I look
like a teen girl okay this face mask is
so good so I'm using the origins face
mask on my face but then this Saturn one
by Sunday Riley is also so good and this
is not sponsored pages this one's really
good and then I always moisturize my
face with the ginseng origins one and it
smells so good and then and I went I
took a bath normally I don't take baths
especially when it's hot outside because
that just is annoying but I did because
I wanted to show off this new lush bath
bomb that I got and it was so cool I
think this one's the experimenter but it
was like sparkly and I was thinking if
there was like Neverland and there was a
river in Neverland then this is what the
water would look like like it was so
cool thanks guys so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed it this is this is
pretty accurate to what I do on my daily
after school night routine I hope you
guys enjoyed it if you did give it a
thumbs up and subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
