so bad so if I start to cry in middle
Vale I'm sorry I don't know Grace's time
so today's video is April favorites 2017
and April when by so fast it was I can
feel like it's already the whole entire
years just already like gone by so fast
but I did pick up a few favorites along
the way and and so without further ado
let's just get started
so I'm going to start off with Beauty
favorites and at the top of the list we
got some good old karmic IOA you cos is
that they're cute even though they're
not that moisturizing and then so when L
videos start using Carmack's and
basically as a crimson by one they're
only $0.99 I not get the hype so
moisturizing it's like ridiculous it
feels like your lips are drinking a big
glass of water so get yourself a little
comics so if you watch any of my makeup
tutorials I show you every single time
it's the the new dude I shadow palette
by the balm cosmetics I am showing here
as I said first off it's one my favorite
palettes it's my only palette that I own
but it's like literally my favorite I'm
sure you guys the color that I literally
war almost every single day in April
whenever I felt like my makeup was ugly
I just put on a little bit of this eye
shadow and I feel like it made it look
so much better but it's called bitch
I'll do a close-up of it oh so pretty so
when I stand last duty sweet wave work
the next and last Beauty favorite of
April is this NYX face and body glitter
I bought this for a photo shoot and it
works so well but I also just like put
it on for fun the other day it's just
such a pretty silver holographic glitter
whenever I have used a glitters they get
so like stuck to my face so I then take
a shower and that's like in my hair is
all over my face good nice what about it
is that I feel like it just comes off
like it does it get everywhere so next
category favorites is music I always
have to do this together
always fun eating music by the way come
on hold up I have to buy and I post all
of my music on there you guys are always
constantly asking you so when you think
I use in my youtube videos is not
popular music I guess so a lot of you
guys are always asking about the name of
the song
or whatever and normally I put them in
the description box or I respond to
other people comments but I do have a
Spotify so go follow that because all
music is always on there and make
monthly playlists playlists I make
monthly playlists every month there's a
new one with all my favorite songs I
started my May one yesterday and already
of 12 songs so I'm very proud and
they're also good go homie at under
formerly Catherine I'll have a link in
the description but let me show you my
most played songs in equal if you watch
any of my other YouTube videos you will
probably recognize some of the songs
because I will put them in there but
look so and by the way all the songs
they notice that I listed all terms and
s an on purpose how it happened this
first one is called silver by Childish
Gambino it's just like a really like
funky it's just like a really like
popping song it's really cool and
nothing's rolling the next one is called
a sign of the times by Harry Styles and
this is probably the most recognized
song you guys suffer of sized behinds
just hang out I don't know why I thought
I was like listening to it so much I'm
normally not really into that type of
style music the next one is called
searchin by tessellated and all the
thing that right when I was listening to
it it like took us on intuition I was
not expecting it I really liked it
it's a rap song this is the next song it
is called shock for by shy love and
Jones I really like the song because if
you listen to it with headphones it's
like wrapping around your skull I love
those songs so ones were like the audio
is in different years anyway so moving
on this is like really awkward sorry
there's play other ones that I really
loved but if I change out all the songs
in the video what would be like 30
minutes to just go find spot fire to
them the next category is clothing
favorites so they're just kind of I
didn't I have many clothes II I did my
little shopping throughout the month in
April but I just noticed that I find
myself lines these type of clothes so
much zipper Jun is a t-shirt this one
stolen hanger but I learned more
t-shirts every single day of the month
of April I mean when do I not wear
t-shirts like I'm shocked and I'm
wearing a jean jacket today I picked it
up in the month of April so this word
then it's a tiger because I have a tiger
I wore I promise you I'm not joking I
wore mom jeans every single day except
for one day and I regretted today I did
not wear mom's because they were
speeding it just made me appreciate how
comfortable mom jeans are so these are
my newest ones that I picked up at the
fish store and these are Wranglers and
so they're super soft I was not
expecting that but they're so
comfortable they feel like pajama pants
and I'm not even lying it's because
they're worn already booked the next
clothing favorite were these holographic
unicorn adidas I got they got Shalini
before the school year started silly
we're in August 2016 and I did wear them
but I didn't wear them too often because
they just didn't know how to style them
I recently just started literally
wearing them with anything and I really
love them they are super comfortable I
always got a ton of compliments whenever
I wear these until good how could it
compliments the next clothing favorite
and last one is fuzzy socks because I do
on my almonds koi in the basement and
is so cold in my house and so I always
put up fuzzy socks and they just make me
so much warmer even if I'm not like
wearing a jet here whatever and tonight
you at least allotted heat in your feet
so the next one is at favorites so just
like my most CF I'm just I used spot
price so much every single month but I
was on hot rod like every single day
this month I super n that means to
occlude the term month so that was my
first most used one and then the second
most usual one with snapchat and
normally so I didn't really post on
snapchat but I was always account
turning my other friends and so thought
it's been a ton of fun and I didn't even
know what a streak was before the month
of April I just started one it was like
my friends and it's just been a lot of
fun just to wake up every morning hey
take an ugly picture and then send some
the next one is I'm PD I literally this
this absolute is life saver because I'll
be watching with me and then I'll
recognize one of the characters but I
don't know where they're from so I end
up like searching it and then I like oh
you know that's the only way when you
like remember something oh my god and
then the next one is a game and I'm not
a game player really at all Hill Climb
racing this is my stronger they didn't
ask me to do this I'm just saying I
literally played me my brother with no
competitions on this game
I guess I'm racing I think those racing
games are super fun like Mario Kart I
will say I do like a good old racing
games good the next one is my youtuber
favorites and I live to because I didn't
really go to hashtags Rachel came to
literally all her makeup tutorials are
so good they're so bomb you I want to be
safe all my I say that she is so good at
makeup and I was like gay anyway every
time I watch them I get so inspired so
shout-out to you Rachel k2

like April 29 started even though Kiki

is Jourdan Clark and she has the most
relaxing and like aesthetically pleasing
and likes fun videos to watch
she autistic unity eyes and they're just
like I recreated like five per year life
