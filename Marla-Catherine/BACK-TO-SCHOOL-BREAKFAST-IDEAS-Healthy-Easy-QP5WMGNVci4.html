to my cooking channel cook with Marla
and I burn everything no I'm pretty good
I'm pretty good hey guys it is Marla and
today we're reviewing a cooking video
I'm in my kitchen my kitchens a little
ugly we're gonna be redoing the cabinet
soon so today we're doing a food wheel
row me know today's room is going to be
a back-to-school
food video and breakfast and lunch ideas
because I don't know about you but I ate
this same exact name every single day
during the entire school year and it got
kind of boring and I hope you guys get
some good ideas for the upcoming school
year
and let's just get right into this video
so this first breakfast idea is this
fruit bowl cup thing that I just kind of
created and it tasted really good
so what you're going to need is any type
of fruit that you guys wants why this
honeydew on hand and I had some fresher
berries and you can literally mix this
up to however you want it's just what I
had on hand and then it took some about
Giovanni Greek yogurt and I would
definitely recommend using Greek yogurt
because it's more protein packed and it
will keep you full longer and you're
gonna need some granola so you just
layer your cup or whatever you want
almost like a parfait but not really and
I use strawberry Greek yogurt it tastes
better and this one is so nice you can
also eat it on the way to school if you
wanted to the next breakfast idea is a
recreation of the Nutter Butter which is
a peanut butter strawberry and granola
smoothie which tastes so good and it
what's inside of it is one cup of milk I
used almond milk because I'm kind of
lactose intolerant you guys do not know
and then it's a vanilla extract to give
it that good flavor some fresh
strawberries I would highly recommend
using frozen ones though some peanut
butter and you can add how much peanut
butter or some ice some granola and
and also I added more ice Oh and half a
banana so I put this in there and I
stirred it all up and once it was done
being started I'd also like hands
stirred in some granola and then the
reason why chunky is because there's the
granola inside of there they taste so
good and I would highly recommend making
this so this next one is more it's not
necessarily how to make this lunch it's
just more like lunch ideas so I packed a
I packed applesauce pretzels a drink
which is this kombucha I don't even like
caputure some like turkey pastrami some
vegetables and fruit so those are like
basic things that I think everyone
should be packing and also some gum
because I cannot tell you how many times
I've like I cannot express to you guys
how many times I've been able to taste
my breath after lunch which is really
gross so I always make sure I've been
packing it so montgome oh I'm mighty
Gump really thank you guys for watching
I hope you enjoyed the video if you did
thumbs up but you don't have to yeah

you so much for 225 thousand of you guys

to say thank you to you guys anyway lets

a great day bye tits it running on empty

drink coconuts in school so it says to
using a heavy knife carefully cut off
the diamond shape part of the coconut

brother will assist me
