going to be a back-to-school lookbook
and how you can take a minimal amount of
clothes and you can sell them different
ways and I really hope you guys find
some inspiration or you just find I
don't know whatever you're feeling you
want to find in this video and that you
guys enjoy it and so let's get right on
into it the first outfit is more of a
jock itch or sporty girlish type of
outfit and it has these really cute
jeans that from cotton on with a bunch
of like bold letterings and really cool
and cute words and they're the boyfriend
style and I got this really cool and
chic backpack from Aeropostale and my
shirt is also from Aeropostale and it's
more of the crop style with a letter A
the next offer is the same gene to get a
different shirt a bit more of a
tomboyish look industries from Arras and
my shoes are suggest wearing converse
but I forgot to bring mine and so I'm
just wearing these sandals from go Jane
the next outfit is taking the same shirt
but giving it more of an artistic vibe
by wearing a pair of different pants and
these pants are also from calling on and
they have like the really cool patchwork
and like dark stain patches and that is
not a pocket it's like a stain of a
pocket it's a little weird but I love it
the next outfit is for my girly girls
out there but this is a very very cute
peplum from forever 21 and then I took
the same jeans for the more that classic
and chic look and then my hair is down
and I'm wearing my glasses the next
outfit is this more of a casual yet
classy and it's these ripped jeans with
the dark stain from Aeropostale
and then my shirt is from Ross and then
the shoes you're about to see are also
from Ross and I just like to tell you
guys there are 15 bucks and I don't know
about you but these are these shoes are
so cute especially for $15 and ignore
the paint on my feet we've been painting
my house lately and links to all these
clothes will be in the downbar if you
