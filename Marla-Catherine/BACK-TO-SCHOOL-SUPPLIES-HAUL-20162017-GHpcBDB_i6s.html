week's video is going to be a what's in
why do I give them to you on to my
backpack this video is going to be a
back-to-school 2016-2017 supplies haul
and you guys are probably thinking right
now Marla is July 9 well the car were
you thinking are you on crank okay so to
start off with I'm going to show you
guys my notebooks that I purchased and I
just went to Walmart because honestly
who needs Target like Walmart I honestly
feel like Target is just like the
expensive version of Walmart you can get
the same exact things at Walmart you
find it like Target except for that I
can't okay that's when it comes to a car
parts and lunch boxes that's what you
can't find that but anyway so I went to
Walmart and it's a pretty cute stuff so
the first first off is this like really
really glittery gold notebook and is
like literally it's like every direction
there's sparkles and that is good for a
girl like me I like some good sparkles I
got the gold one because gold is just
really classy and then you guys it's
just the light paper on the inside on
the back though it's a little bit
weirder like a like watercolor rainbow I
guess it's cool anyway so for these two
notebooks they are there were only like
seventy cents at Walmart and go to
Walmart if you want some cheap notebooks
that will last you throughout the whole
year I'm going to be making these
notebooks that are kind of dull and a
little bit plain into some really fun
notebooks so stay tuned for those DIYs
in an upcoming video and then my next
joke book is more of a like a
competition book and since it's what
it's called but it's like this cute mint
green and it's very flexible so fitting
my ocker easily my backpack and then
this is my big boy it's just big five
star five subject notebook and I just
got white because white is plain and
it's classic so that's a wrap for the
notebooks and moving on to more of the
random stuff this is a breath savers
through our mint long lasting Vince and
make your brush smell good because when
you have like you boy walk up can be
like hey
happens especially when you have braces
like me and you're advised not to
achieve gum it's nice a mint and then
for my gum um I'm not supposed to chew
gum but um I got the Trident minty sweet
twist and I like this sweet mint I feel
like it tastes better than the regular
mint and therefore the next random thing
we got these really fun and neon index
cards and index cards are a must-have
especially when you get into the older
grades because there's going to be
things for test there's more serious
tests there's more notes you need to be
taking you could write down your
multiplication skills and you can test
yourself during lunch if you feel like
you need practice on that and for my
next kind of random thing it is this
what is this called stack a shelf extra
tall and it is this cute it is this cute
big green that is very very it's it's a
locker so my lock the lockers at my
schools are not full-length body they're
just like the half ones and so
maximizing space is very important and
um last year I actually couldn't
maximize any of my space because I had
to fit my violin there and that
literally I have to like smack it in
anyway if you have a locker like that
were you just like there's no room for
cute like give this video a big thumbs
up as for pens and pencils and all that
jazz we are the big pencil extra strong
break resistant legs and they are in the
cool ones everyone had these last year
and was like the one person that didn't
have the cool mechanical pencils
I'd like to cheat of one that I found in
English on the floor in the back corner
now I'm home masses abandoned so I got
to make sure that I have tons and tons
mechanical pencils because I actually
started out with this much at the
beginning of last year and by the first
week all of them were gone I don't even
get how that happens because there's so
many there's like 24 plus 3 which equals
27 for the next item of pens or whatever
these are the two highlighters that I
got they're just the big
and it's the neon green in the neon blue
okay I got the erasable colored pencils
because I'm gonna let you provide to
draw to the lines even if they don't
mean to like I'm not the best at art and
that is why I take art this year because
I just have given up
thanks wrong James subscribe this we
don't a gigantic thumbs up if you feel
like double-jointed people deserve to be
