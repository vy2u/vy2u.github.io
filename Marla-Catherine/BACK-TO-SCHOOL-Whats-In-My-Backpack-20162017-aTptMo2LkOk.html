today's video is going to be drama
please
what's my backpack 2016-2017 two-factor
school edition because aa B it's like
all school it's like July it's probably
you guys probably be watching this like
sometime later in July or whatever but
school is starting around the bend or
whatever you want to say for some people
they're shining in two weeks and people
are starting in like three months
because they just go on to summer
vacation so I'm sorry if you want to let
people that just got onto summer
vacation and you're like starting to get
sick of you back to school videos cuz
you just got up but you'll get over I
promise you just click another video if
you don't want to watch it for those
that do want to stay tuned for what is
in my backpack so to start off I my
backpack that I have from you last year
I even got my new backpack yet but this
is my backpack from last year and it
held up pretty well it's one from
Claire's so to start off with um I'm
going to show you guys kind of what's in
the pocket and what's in the pocket is
pencils because I just always like to
have just like a few on hand you know
just like two or three if I'm ever hour
bus ride ever is clogged up or whatever
you want to say it's like congested and
we're not moving that fast I'm able to
pull out my homework and do it and I
always like to have some pencils of
hands and I like how you don't have to
awkwardly get up in the middle of class
when it's like silent reading and you're
secretly doodling you're not supposed to
be doing that and your pencil it breaks
but you want to keep on doodling so you
get up and you sharpen up your pencil
trusty old mechanical pencils don't make
you do that next up inside of my pocket
is these headphones because I don't know
about you I'm not a germaphobe or
anything I just like don't like using
the school's headphones and something
about the fact that like the whole
school has one of those headphones at
one point or another kinda grosses me
out and so I like to always bring my own
headphones and these are actually not my
favorite ones I don't know are my
ones are so next step inside of my
pocket is this a OS a OS is not my
favorite Verna tragic just because it
doesn't last that long but they are very
cute and this is the in the flavor
coconut milk and I love coconut so and
that next up is this I got this for my
dentist and they always get this out I
love them they're called ice drops and
there should fresh drops and they like
hurt your mouth whenever when you put
the mix is so strong and minty this is
the cinnamon one I love cinnamon too
this just makes your breath smells so
good and it does last pretty long and
then next stuff inside of my dark crack
is a my I'm not going to show you the
front because as my orthodontist logo on
the front but this is the back it's just
this big bright orange one that I got to
choose out I don't know why orange but
anyway um so it's just my keeps all my
orthodontist up for braces I honestly I
can say I don't like braces I don't look
I don't know some people I've heard like
they like the way they look with braces
I'm not one of those people I just it
just looks like by age if if you guys
wanna see a separate video of like me
explain like how to take mirror my
braces my braces routine or that stuff
and like what's specifically inside of
here then I'll give this video a thumbs
up and comment down below that you want
that next up in my backpack is the you
guys saw this in my school supplies
video if you watch that they'll be
linked down below or you can just go
back on my channel and you'll find that
video and this I show you guys in there
and it is the gold notebook and I love
gold and I love sparkles and so but my
purpose for using this is this school
year and having it in my backpack is
because normally I keep my notebooks or
whatever inside of my locker but I'm
gonna have to take this one home because
I'm on the yearbook committee this year
and I'm in here but really writing out
all the stuff like what the projects you
need to do and then I'm going to be old
taking them home and working on them and
so this is going to be
I know look for that and then the next
item in here is the pink pink sea salt
and papaya lotion and it is the one of
the miniature versions and this first
off it smells so good enough it is
pretty moisturizing and the last but
certainly not the least are just kind of
hair products so like hair ties hair
elastics and bobby pins but just give
this video a thumbs up for
back-to-school videos and even if you
don't like school I mean the actual
process of like getting new clothes or
getting new school supplies is pretty
fun so that's why you should give it a
thumbs up and then subscribe if you guys
want to get notified of when I post new
videos that way you're not missing out
on anything and it murmured to comment
down below when your school starts
because I'd love to know thank you guys
