and today we have another video and
today is going to be about babysitting
tips and tricks and the five that taught
for what to do and what not to do Moll
be easy the first do on my list is ask
the parents if they if the kids have
allergies before the leap because
weapons if you repeat a child peanut
butter when they are allergic to peanuts
that would not be good okay and then the
first don't on my list is do not be on
your phone if you do bring a phone only
use it for calling your parents they're
calling the if you need help or calling
the parents of the children that you
witnessing if you need questions or any
but do not be on your phone and don't
let the kids plan your phone that's
taking away that some parents are strict
about technology things like that so I I
would advise you not to do that the
number two on my do list is clean up
after your messes with the kids so teach
you to the kids to be clean and tidy and
also when you come when the parents come
back they'll see that the house is clean
and that you're going to babysit your
with that the number two on my don't
list is do not snoop do not go into the
parents bedroom and look around at what
they have don't look at personal items
do you not do any of that because first
off this is not your house this is not
your this is not your stuff and you
don't have the right to do it so you not
do that the number three on my do list
is lock the doors so when the parents
leave off the doors and if so knocks on
the door like look through the window or
look that people see it is you don't
know if the mood is do not answer it the
parents can you can tell it that you can
tell the parents when they come back
that someone knocked on the door the
number three one we don't list is do not
say things you want the kids repeating
back to the
parents parents so don't tell you don't
tell any of the kids scary stories
nothing like that because then these
kids will repeat back to their parents
and then the parents will realize that
you're not that great of a babysitter
and you're not very responsible and you
don't want that so remember to do not
say things that you don't want the kids
repeating and at number four on my list
my do list is to be patient and kind if
you start with patients maybe
babysitting isn't the best thing for you
but you can work on that so and also
make kind if someone if one of the kids
are being rude to you or anything like
that rare to be kind back to em and
teach him kindness and it also if you
hear any more if you hear if you hear
any like weird noises in the background
it's because my parents are renovating
their house and so if you hear any songs
or trance lots or anything everything's
okay
okay and then my number four on my don't
list is don't leave the kids unintended
outside or anywhere of that matter do
not leave them unattended and also
always have a watchful eye on them now
here's something that I have made at
something kind of like Girl Scouts we
made this is called our babysitting
binder this is what it looks like and
you got a designer own in mind just as
babysitting one on and basically what it
is is it's full of like in the front
pocket it has like you can have notes in
there and then on the first page for
them no no on the first page like it
says safety first and it has a fair
shake it behind it and also has like how
to do the Heimlich maneuver for infants
and toddlers you can see that and
basically it's full of things like that
and also it has like tips and tricks on
what to do and what not to do while
babysitting mine also has like songs you
can see into the kids like Murphy rhymes
it
you transmit them down they won't go
also like it has coloring pages and
crayons in there like that and so this
is basically I always bring this
particular Basin I actually really love
it because the kids it keeps them
entertained in it dick research parents
that I kind of know how to do the
Heimlich maneuver and things like that
so this is really handy when I'm
babysitting another tip and just a trick
that you could do is go to your local
hospital or something like that and they
offer some classes on how to do the
Heimlich maneuver or like a child with
choking or someone's choking how you can
do that and so that is a tip to do it's
like yeah like a scenario with a kid
chunking you'll be able to do it and
that is about it for today um also if
you want any more tips on how to babysit
a watch of Jesse on Disney Channel
I just think that's about it for today
