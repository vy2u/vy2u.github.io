back-to-school clothing haul and I'm not
done shopping this is just some of the
stuff and a fun fact of the day I'm a
very picky shopper even I go shopping
with my sister she's not gets mad at me
because I never choose out anything I
don't like anything so let's get started
to start off with we have Aeropostale
and I've got one thing there and well
it's this like a plum color and it has
their local logo and like a floral color
you see that and I just liked it I love
oh I always love to throw on a t-shirt a
pair of jeans and some shoes and it's
just comfortable and it's nice okay so
next up I have from Claire's is I got a
backpack and you guys are not gonna
believe this but I got this backpack for
five dollars okay isn't that insane well
Sauternes here's the long story short my
little sister bought a backpack for 20
dollars and in the store it's everything
is buy one you get one five dollars so I
got the second backpack for five dollars
and there's another out of it so I
thought it was really cute it's leather
it'll go with a lot of things and by the
way my junior height is not a lot of
backpacks you have to put them in your
locker but just in case if I need to
bring a jacket you know I want to blank
out my locker I can always put in here
bringing school supplies um next up is
H&amp;amp;M and I just saw it I also got only
one short shirt there and this is like a
flowy shirt it's like a peach colored
and it just says like Tracy's faces and
did you just kind of have this I don't
even know what that is well you call it
tribal hello and I just it's free flowy
it's a long in the back and then short
in the front it's one of those style
tees and I just love it my next item is
from Old Navy and no I did not have
enough time to shop there so I only got
one thing and that is my lunch box
and you will again see this lunch box in
this upcoming video on Friday and my
back to school lunch ideas and so this
is what it looks like and it's a
holographic lunch box and this is going
back in this aisle guys so go get
yourself one and I got this for six
dollars so that's a steal
hey I I went to forever 21 and I am in
love with that story guys everything
there is started off with I just got to
plain T's I got I've actually been
wearing this and if you follow me on
instagram at marla cough and you've seen
that i wore this shirt with my pineapple
and so just this it's a v-neck and it
has long and longer sleeves i then i got
another one in the same style except in
like an oatmeal color so there's that
and I got waist for three dollars guys
yeah okay next up is this like army
green jacket and it sounds like the
lungs please had buttons and zippers and
it's olive green and I just absolutely
love that and I got this for $21 guys
and the sleeves are tapered on the end
and that is amazing next up from forever
21 is these jeans they're just long
jeans long skinny jeans dark wash not
really that's about it
and I got these for $8 so go to for over
two and I have a lot of cute styles for
they're really inexpensive and the last
was certainly not least I have a few
accessories so it's from forever 21
again and well I think there's my
favorite thing but guys it's lips lip
balm but it's in a macaroon type style
so it barely looks like a macaroon and
when you just unscrew it okay when you
just didn't screw it there's the lip
balm and the eye you wipe it and I got
the flavor of vanilla and I wasn't too
excited about the flavor but I loved the
color so that's why I got that and then
I sure that I got like a six pack of
earrings for six dollars so about a
dollar each so as you can see there's
like some studs and bow you're in
tortoises on there there's like some
flowers gemstones but they're just
really versatile and they're cute and I
just like them so that wraps up this
