clothespins next you're going to need
some glitter hearts or any stickers of
that matter and you're simply going to
just put the stickers on to your
clothespin this DIY is super cute and
it's easy and that great action next up

this liquid pearls that I purchased from
my local craft store you're just going
to arrange your polka dots and in any
way you would like to after that you're
going to shake it out a little just to
find them next up is watercolor
you're going to first pour some water
into a little container and then take
your blue food coloring and it dip about
and put in about 15 to 20 drops because
you really want it to be saturated next
you're going to stir that up
then you put in your clothes pin and no
it does not have to be fully submerged
because you can dip it because you can
then turn it over after about 10 minutes
after about 20 minutes of being there
just put it onto a paper towel to let it
dry out next up is DIY Polaroids that
your FASFA

Google Images and find some
inspirational quotes or photos that your

to click on the frame and then click on
Polaroid frame and there you have it
your own your very own pool rate and you
can also make your own quotes if you
would like to take a
after that you're going to click Save
and just upload it to your computer and
then print it out and cut it out and
there you have it super easy DIY and no
you do not have to purchase a Polaroid
so with the Polaroids you're just going
to hang them up on the clothespin that
we have made and attach that to some
Magnum I added in my own little mirror

I have bought in Joanne's for about $4
cutter super cubes and you can also have
a little pencil for open next up is
these magnets I have purchased from
Walmart for about $2 and they are very
cute and fun click but one out it's not
the same as when I punched it I had an
extra Polaroid so I just put that onto
