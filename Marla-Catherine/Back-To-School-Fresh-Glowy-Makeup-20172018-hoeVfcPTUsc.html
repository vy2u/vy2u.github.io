going to be a super easy glowy and fresh
makeup tutorial now let me tell you this
magnet Oriole is perfect for a birthday
cool because I think I personally think
first impressions like first day school
they matter so it's all good you want to
look super glowy super pretty and so
this week's book is super easy and you
would if you watch any of my makeup
tutorials on my channel you know that I
like to keep them a pretty natural I
like to enhance my features instead of
covering them up which is also why I
partnered with Sephora collection to
bring you guys this video
I'm so excited first off I love Sephora
and so this is such an awesome
opportunity and also all these parts
have become like my new favorites
especially the bronzer pecans are so
good this look is super easy and you
guys want to see how you can get this
then you can watching the video if you
guys end up at recreating that this look
or you just use any support collections
products make sure you guys post it to
social media in your test checks to
Flora collection and the hashtag of
beauty uncomplicated honestly this is
what support collection is all about
beauty uncomplicated because I know
beauty and makeup can get so complicated
they want to make sure it's easy and
it's fun to do and it's just you know
it's simple so to start off this makeup
look I'm going to be using my Sephora
collection at beauty amplifier afterglow
primer and Luminizer this stuff is very
cool I had kind of a weird consistency
but like it feels finding fake it just
helps prolong your face makeup and it
helps luminize and have an inner glow
and you know everything that everyone
wants and at primers derma
so the star of the show is this Sephora
collection make no mistakes foundation
and concealer stick I use number two
number four and number seven these
foundation sticks are awesome because
they're like a tuned one you can be used
as foundation sticks or and concealer
stick it's really cool because either
like sick enough to be a concealer but
they're like like lightweight enough to
be as a foundation because when you
blend it out they just feel super
lightweight and natural okay interface
so I use number four which is a little
bit lighter one I used it like in my
t-zone to kind of highlight and then I
used the number seven kind of as a
darker one just to put all over my face
I love these foundation and concealer
sticks because there's like no way you
could waste any products because I know
I am the type of person to squirt out a
ton of foundation onto the back of my
hand and then end up wasting a lot of it
so now I'm taking it for collection
brush number 202 which is a dual brush
and has like concealer and a foundation
inside I'm taking it the foundation
stick which is the number two and it's a
super light one and I'm using it as my
concealer so now I'm using a Sephora
collection brush number 208 you got to
see me do my eyebrows like so much so I
just didn't film this but now moving on
to my eyes I use a Sephora collection
tinted it including eye primer and
number five at matte to beige and I've
never used an eye primer before so super
said to use this also has a really cool
applicator but this stuff did work it
made my life so much longer and it has
like a khaki filling so your eyeshadow
stick so much better now I'm using
Sephora collection a pro pigment palette
and cool so if you guys know me I'm more
of a warm toned girl but I tried this
out and I end up loving it so much I'm
taking Sephora collection brush number
205 and I meant taking it some like a
kind of more of a cool tone Brown I just
blend those together and make sure they
look good and then I switched to the
number 206 brush from the store
collection and I just kind of like pad
that all down after I did my eye shadow
I set my face with Sephora collection at
beauty and flower set and refresh spray
I set my face with this like throughout
the entire makeup tutorial just to keep
it fresh and glowy and natural-looking
and all that good stuff I'm not rolling
my super straight eyelashes and I'm
using Sephora collection at lash crafts
big Volume Mascara in zero one and your
HS care is not waterproof let me just
get that out of the way but this still
worked great for me which I was kind of
shocked
I really loved the formula of visit
mascara it had jojoba oil in it I only
put on like two coats but just the first
coat my lashes already looks great I
would not recommend putting on five
coats of mascara but your eyelashes
would still look awesome there'd be no
flaking or smudging or any of that this
huskers like intensely black which is
awesome it has very intense pigment and
it's made my eyelashes look so Paulo -
I'm now using a Sephora collection
bronzing face powder and at Los Cabos
and medium number three and this is my
reaction when I used it because this is
my new favorite I'm also using the
Sephora collection brush number 204 and
this one is also a dual one it's a blush
and browsing which is so awesome but
like why I'm saying I think I like this
more than the hoola bronzer which is
like a shocker to me because I really
love vanilla bronzer but this one is so
good I do I know there's something about
it it's just awesome then I'm taking
Sephora collection contour blush palette
and I love lush so much I feel like it
just makes my face look alive and I'm
using the same brush which is the dual
end and I'm taking the blush side of it
I then at used the number two and three
out of blush palette and it made up my
face to look like it was alive and I
wasn't a zombie and that's what I want
to look like for school so the last step
I did for this makeup tutorial is I took
a by Sephora collection beauty amplifier
which is a set and refresh spray I set
my face and it looks super fresh super
natural looking and perfect for school I
would totally recommend the sake of
tutorial it's also perfect for the first
day like I said because first
impressions you know want to look good
so far was also kind enough to send me
their Sephora collection clay masks
which are made to address a variety of
different skin care needs for example
this yellow one revitalizes and tones
and that is exactly what I needed the
other colors in their line also
addressed different skin care needs
which is super awesome and I'd highly
recommend these these are so good thank
you guys so much for watching this video
I hope you guys enjoyed it and I just
like to say a gigantic thank you - it's
a for collection for wearing with me for
this video it's just so cool I just I
love the Goron's also so awesome if you
guys are interested in any of the pipes
that I used in this video me tell you
the bronzer was still good and these
foundation sticks you cannot waste any
product you do these so they're so
they're so awesome anyway so if you guys
