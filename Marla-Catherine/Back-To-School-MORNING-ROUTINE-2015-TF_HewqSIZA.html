welcome back today hi guys welcome back
to Marla Kathryn today we're going to be
doing a video on my back to school
morning routine and what I do so let's
get started
good morning I like to start off my day
by hitting the snooze button like seven
times because seriously guys I am a
procrastinator after finally convincing
myself to get out of bed I like to head
downstairs to start my personal hygiene
I like to use my suitable cleanser
because it removes all the excess oil
without stripping me with being dry then
I like to brush my teeth because
seriously guys you do not want to smell
my breath in North brusha brusha brusha
mall
make up so I like to start off my makeup
with using my daily moisturizer and
seriously guys I can never get out of
the tube because I use it so much
my beauty cream it follows right after
that I like to dot someone my nose and
around there because it covers up my
blemishes and all the red spots I then
curl my eyelashes because my ashes are
naturally straight and I really hate
that freaking sucks guys after that is
my mascara and it's in the shade of
black if you were wondering then I like
to brush my eyebrows
I then use my BB lips and it's the
doctor rescue kind because sometimes I
get really job looks my outfit of the
day so everything you see is from
forever 21
except for my shoes which those are from
go Jane calm next is breakfast so lately
I've been loving eating a yogurt and I'm
pairing that with a yoke with a fruit
and I've been loving this
Dannan Greek yogurt that they came out
with and it has 15 grams of protein so
that really fills me up and then today I
paired it with a mango then I grabbed my
backpack and I lay through the door
because I need to get to school thank
you guys so much for watching we are to
give this video a big thumbs up because
who doesn't like better school morning
routines I don't know anyone that
doesn't like it stay tuned for more
back-to-school video so you can hit this
big subscribe button somewhere bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
