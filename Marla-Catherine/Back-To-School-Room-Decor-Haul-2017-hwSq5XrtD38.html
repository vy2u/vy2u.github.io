going to be doing a room decor haul and
the video is sponsored by society6 and
just like to say thank you old society
to do this so basically society6 is a
company where artists are able to make
and submit designs to this website and
then society6 is able to pretty designs
onto literally anything like us to note
both bags prints canvases and it was
super cool about this is that whenever
you purchase one of these items from
societics that the artist that created
that pattern or design gets pasted it's
really often because when you're able to
support small artists and i literally
love everything that i got it's insane
and i also got kind of took you guys up
i have a discount code and it is marla
gill and so you guys when you guys use
that discount code at the checkout
you're able to get normally 10% off
which is like a big deal because
everything else up but you get free
worldwide shipping so that is like major
because a lot of things from society6
are like big or community and they so
they weigh more and then shipping to get
like like through the roof so expensive
so through the united states free
shipping live in brazil free shipping so
Marla's deals go use that so let's just
get into this haul so I have some up
here the items right here I'm just going
to start so the first item is a biga
floor cushion and urban outfitter just
like none of the slower cushions in it
they're always so trendy so I thought
would get one and I chose up and super
cute print it's like a floral orange and
yellow and I love this cuz obviously so
I just like you this one is that kind of
a bean bag you know it's really cute and
it's so it's so soft and like squishy so
the next two items are these clothes and
these are so cute
I chose its design because obviously
leaf like they're plants what did you
expect and I'm super excited for these
because these are my favorite clothes
I've ever seen and I've ever owned and
not only that but they're so amazing a
high quality they're like a canvas
pillow so they're like super thick and
it came to pillow insert so that was
awesome so the next items that are in
the bag and his actual bag I didn't even
order but they send it to me so well to
the side of them we have super high
quality and it's this really cute print
so it's like a world map fridge and it's
like this pastel blue with pastel colors
super high quality this looking perfect
for like going to the beach or go to the
pool or using for abacus cool guys you
guys want to use up that you know it's
pros your school tonight
I have three of us and I I'm so obsessed
with these patterns are so cute so this
first notebook out of the three is this
one my brother already community thought
it was so cool it's a Maxum escape and
that kind of summarizes you tall like
mountains you know it's great because
it's like white paper you can use it for
taking notes at school and they also
sent another to the same section except
different patterns this was a yellow
floral and then this is a golden marble
which is so cute and then they said be
it Cup in this floral pattern I think
they kind of took the vintage that I
like floral and that I like yellow
because they printed it on three items
so this is a last little like small item
like just coming to the item and I did
order this and it was even cuter than I
thought it's going to be but it's this
clock and it has the same world map
print it's like pencil color with this
natural wood on lining and then like a
white hand and it is so cute octopus in
my bathroom and it just is always nice
to have an y'all just have the quacks be
right there so the next three prints are
all what made by same artist and his
name is Rio
take Monta occlusive it so wrong I'm
just going off on the screen but my
brother actually chose these out and if
he really liked them so let me show you
them so this first one is like a hill
landscape with a man already good bike
down in the corner and as a lake very
big blue sky I feel like this artist
it's kind of art with minimalistic
artists and it's in Tyler's room is kind
of dark and he never opens up the blinds
this isn't really good cause it like
lightens up his room and this is
probably my favorite one out of all
three so this next canvas print is has
the sky is super red and then it has
orchestrate with the big moon this will
remind you
not exactly
Anna does is like a Wes Anderson that
type inspired canvas I don't but I this
is also super cool and then this last
teeny from the Rio to the muscles this
one is just a big blue I think he's fine
well I'm pretty sure he's flying over
the ocean but it's this like plane at
flying over the ocean with some clouds
and this one is super cool but I don't
know why that arrives me so much of the
movie I'm broken and they're like
playing over the ocean but this one's
also super good and I think this is my
brother's favorite one or maybe the
other one it's I don't know
so this next painting is backwards I
just want to quickly show you guys that
this maintains all the canvases and let
glass prints they have little wiring bag
I do hair in your nail and then he is so
super easy
this one is have the same print as one
of the notebooks and it's this super big
mountain that landscape I know I just
really like mountains and it reminded
Utah and then it may sent me another one
of their like the exact same print
except this one is a metal print I'm
always so screwed on your braces I am
pulling notices up moving yell at me in
comments but I'm pretty sure this is New
York I don't really know but it's a big
big canvas of I'm pretty sure sweetie I
agree with his New York of New York in
like a kind of a bird's eye view and
it's really pretty and it's just really
an die think it's very modern
so they said another one of those was
New York I feel like moments are a
little bit more modern than chemistry so
this next is this one is a male friend
and this is the gold marble look I
wanted to put this one on the living
room because I feel like my family has
some gold hints throughout our house and
I feel I could tie it together but it
still has like that great links to like
gray was born and so it's perfect and
they also sent this one in a big canvas
print so this is the exact imprint
except it is a canvas and this is huge
like and the reason why I just want to
stretch it to you guys again that you
guys should get fully the advantage of
this free shipping and 10% off goes
because something like this to ship out
would make it so much more expensive
because it's heavy and you don't have to
be such a thing so it's free go use the
code Marla dealto this next way is one
of my absolute favorites and it's this
what do you expect it to be oh it's
planned they remind me of seaweed I
don't know thirst which we believe this
seaweed but it's like three little
plants
there and this one is so pretty it has
it's a watercolor time I love painting
Arlo watercolors and I love plants so
this is perfect a screen Marla so the
last one is this one right here I'm
going to take it down and show you guys
but so this last one right here's my
absolute favorite out of all of them and
obviously that's looking at my room it
isn't super like a retro vintage vibe
type of a picture from what looks like
from California so I'm going to assume
like a cute like vintage car with some
palm trees I love palm trees it's so
cute and I had this one above my bed and
or I'm debating what are you hanging
above my bed or a woman's dead calm down
below of what you guys think and then
yeah this is my ultimate one you feel
cute this is
posted cute so many times so that wraps
up this halter so many paintings of our
room right now there it's kinda
ridiculous but I'm so excited to be able
