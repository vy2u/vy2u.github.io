I'm trying to say hey guys because it's
one like persimmon and edit of me saying
hey guys and it's like really annoying
it so I'm sorry that I say that much I
don't know what else to say hello
everyone I'm Marla and it's my channel
mana Kathryn because you know you can
subscribe if you don't want to okay
today's video is a back-to-school one
and I know all you guys either Hasty's
or you love them like it's a love-hate
relationship but you guys asked for it
so I'm going to be doing it also
everything so me I should request online
Instagram telling me that you guys start
school like in a week which is kind of
saying because I just asked like
building soon so I did do a
back-to-school what's in my backpack and
a lot of the items that I showed in
there are going to be shown in this
video except for a new one so I'm going
to get started with my DIY so this first
one is my favorite out of all one and it
is this collage one that I made and it's
so pretty I think it's my favorite one
it like it you need to a team because I
love it like plan to love animals I love
all these flowers and like butterflies
and it's like so pretty
and then I have three more so this next
one is a little like mermaid Ashok on
camera it's really cool and it's
definitely as is world and not very
common so this one is awesome and then
this next one that is like not too crazy
but it's so cute it's just studded star
one so it says Darwin and really pretty
it ditches for like forever to make so I
got a hobby what everything old star on
there you know how to use her thing
sometimes
this last one is more of a joke but it's
a mere like sometimes you're in class
you like like you know you need a mirror
but you can't use the hall hostel you
know this is great so much and kind of
desperate need so those are all mine DIY
notebooks now moving on so it's my next
I like my asshole's also going probably
going to end up like using the most is
is five star one or thirty so it's just
a white to five star one and last year I
have I like got my 5 star not look like
a day before school started so I know
I've have to get like me to get like
like the this hot keep one which is not
my first choice it was still cute but
it's just not my preference so it's not
this white one because I've seen I would
people have them and it just looks nice
you know white also this is a 5 subject
one and so nor my lights go away like 7
o'clock periods and so I just double up
to them
I'm good so this next item is a
checklist and checklist I actually I
found that I need like I I can't explain
to you how many times last year's I go I
should like the checklist because I'd
always use my notebooks this next item
or this next item is a planner and this
is kind of like a checklist but it's
more like a like a legit checklist I'm
probably gonna use this with more larger
events and a keep track of homework this
is from Target it's just like pre pink
marble and it's just wet
so after I think I've only owned one
other planner and then I lost it so
that's why to get that one this item
this next item is so cool I'm so excited
because I've already kind of started
using it even though it's like not
different looks cool like i just used it
for like road trips so it's a gigantic
sketchbook it's like really big and i
have already started to like draw on it
like dual so i'm mostly probably gonna
end up using this when i'm like on the
bus I feel like my bus at my school it
takes forever to leave the parking lot
and I'm just like it's also really good
for like just driving the next few items
are very basic but very needed so it's a
big part of mechanical pencils because
by the end of the second week you're
like looking for more people then the
next item is these highlighters I ended
up I didn't get highlighters next year
but I found that I like needed them a
lot by the way if you guys are looking
for like you know books I go to Target
but if you're like looking for like
school supplies like this go to
Walmart's it's so much cheaper then I
got some fine tip to create all the
murders the next item is a huge pack of
gum because Kiki breath is gross and
it's very unwanted but it still comes
and even if you brush your teeth like by
the second period like your breath
reaches so this is just my favorite
flavor experiment delicious and helpful
this next item is a stapler
I don't really know why I got this I
think it is got this just the extra
children all because I only needed a
stapler like a few times throughout like
the school year see it next item is a
pair just like number two pencils but
these are not basic number two pencils
these are like cute ones like
so these are some target and they are as
a motivational slope stencil so they
have a little coupon so every single
pencil in their different colors the
next item is climax chocolate no so I
like two items I'm just going to find
them in one but it's just a small binder
because I like last year I'm probably
going to end up only you can like my 5
star notebooks but I felt like I needed
like an extra binder to hold on my
likely these papers so this is not about
that 4 and I also inside of it I got
some dividers I'm totally going like
print out - thank you and I'm sure in
there on the inside I just have the
cutest binder dividers in there like
these it's 18 striped ones I know way of
better school supplies like you just
kind of feel better at school Yelp's
like sometimes looking a little rough so
like lean onto your school supplies hook
you out so that is about it for all my
school supplies this video is a little
bit more relaxed in the Denish and so if
you guys could always I always
appreciate when you guys comment down
below video idea so I'd be great to do
that because the video a thumbs up if
you would like it and also if you guys
want a DIY video on how to make those
notebooks that I showed at the beginning

mind that we like doubled our subscriber
