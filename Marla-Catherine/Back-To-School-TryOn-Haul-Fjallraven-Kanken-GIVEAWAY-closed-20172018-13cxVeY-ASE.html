going to be a back-to-school clothing
haul and there's also like a few make up
items in here i'm also doing another
giveaway in this video so stay tuned
until the end is so you can go into that
and hopefully win that so yeah i'm
really excited and let's just get right
on into this video so these first items
I have here are from a company called
pinch so a pinch in a cash back site
that will to save money went you
purchased from your favorite stores like
forever 21 Nordstrom's
Sephora Ulta I my own page on this
website where you guys can go purchase
items that I got and can get cash back
for doing so and so honestly I think
this is such a smart idea because
they're already online shopping why not
save money while doing it so there's
over 800 shorts to choose from when you
go onto the website and you fund store
you want to shop through if you click
through their link to the website and
then you shop on there you can earn the
cash back when you do earn cashback you
can redeem a bio through like PayPal I'm
gone and or other gift cards like
Starbucks Sephora Best Buy's to point
out I'll have links to all the parts
that I have it here and down below and
then you guys can get cash back on them
which is awesome so they first product
are these shoes these are the classic
skate hi a black and white vans and
you'll be nice just to be casual and
easily really cute with mom jeans like
welled up LV so if you do yeah these are
I'm so excited that you wanted me to
royal so that indeed next you the far my
favorite out of all of them and it's
these Deepika Diaz and gizelle shoes and
I've been wearing these so much but
they're a little squeaky but like I
don't mind us they're pretty comfortable
and I think they're just like this is
such a pretty color and these are like
you can't really like mess these up when
you're trying to sell them of anything
so then it'd be next year's July probe
those are blue shoes these are I
actually got these for my brother
because and I'm a juster really good
system you can get messed up on are too
so like I got all the shoes from PacSun
and be drawn there and I was like oh my
brother's over like oh so I got the brim
and there's the 19th
skateboarding there from the state
boring collection so the next three
parts I got through the pinch website or
from Ulta and they're the makeup
products that goes back to school line
so the first one is this your skin but
better CC cream and I've been using this
in so many makeup tutorials and I love
it like pretty lightweight on my skin
but it's all coverage so I went to the
Estee Lauder Double Wear stay in place
so in day I was like
like really good that a lot of fun I got
from them is a mix of vivid bright
yellow eyeliner and I got this and I was
so impressed by how like okay it is so
that's all I got from that pinch but now
I'm moving on is you're not I'm going to
do so I went to Paxton but I purchased
other thing I got me taxing with brandy
melville you know I feel like really
basic shopping here but honestly their
clothes are very like comfortable it's
this Newport Beach we'll just as Newport
but it's in Newport Beach in California
and it's this sweat sugar and I've been
wearing this so much I watch at CVX live
and so comfortable and not a big fan my
sister was actually born in Newport
Beach California so so then I got this
jacket I'm so excited because the thing
about burning Melville is you know I'm
not like a toothpick and I'm not like
you know like the smallest person out
there and so I don't know like what can
I sit me on burning all the website and
what's not going to so I only like to
participate in store from that but I've
been wanting this jacket and I did not
know who's going to say it or not I
thought it stores is the last one and it
fit in far so excited but it's this red
white and blue windbreaker jacket and I
love the way the space I love it so much
and then so this is still from burning
my little but I got this stuff at the
store in Montreal so I got the a classic
honey shirt and you guys have been at
commenting on this so much asking where
it's from from Barrie Melville and it
just has the word honey embroidered on
like the like aren't like over your
heart so I then I try the this necklace
I got at the regular Park Sun in America
you know I'm not a choker person I never
have been I don't think I ever will be
this was like dainty enough and like
long enough for me that I like purchased
it so and it's a very very pretty and
delicate like it has like these really
pretty gold stars and I think this will
be a very brief one I want to be like
more dressed up and on a schedule so the
next week I went to was urban outfitter
this is the first time going to one in
America and I was really excited this
was always you know like the store
itself is very like Urban Outfitters is
you know like I didn't I didn't know
what I was expecting but like the store
itself is very cool and so I just got
like a bunch of scrunchies from them
because I've been saw such as crunches
lately like I know I just think like
they are so what is smart invention
because
you can put your in a ponytail and then
you won't like it that like gross dense
so this first packet crunchies it was
like 12 bucks which I don't think is a
bad price because I purchased one
scrunchie from H&amp;amp;M it was six dollars
this will be nice especially for PE when
I put my hair up in a ponytail but I
don't want that get like that gross dent
then I got like a smaller more like
tighter pack of scrunchies if I want to
actually wear these so they'll be nice
20 they're always like I me get around
Chicago 20 so that's all I got from
Urban Outfitters sort of stay till the
end the next one I watching was H&amp;amp;M and
first I went out from there with another
scrunchie this is six bucks it was the
first country that it purchased so I
didn't know don't do the price or not
it's not so don't spend six cars and one
that scrunchie because honestly like no
so you know scrunchie and then got
t-shirts from there my sister thinks it
looks like the cat from four line hmm so
I know but it's this white t-shirt is
like 15 bucks well honestly like it
feels so clumsy that I don't know if I
would purchase it something like that
again that idea
last time from H&amp;amp;M is this green that
lightning and white striped culture it's
like a more feminine version of like a
man shirt but it was in the bonus
section and I know I just think this
will be nice do I want to be like if
it's more about dress-up day so I got
what I am some forever 21 and I kind of
regret buying them now because I wore
them in their Christmas eat so bad so I
got these shoes and there are these pink
flaps and make sure my seat so about
like it was nine more said these are
like 23 bucks which is actually not that
bad of a price and I can see why now
I noticed my I own a ton of pink shoes I
don't even do that on purpose I just
always like end up buying a pair of
repeat shoes they were so kind it makes
any of these clothes and this isn't
concert or anything but they they're
kind of have to send me these and I've
been wearing all these clothing items so
much recently and I just I love that and
they're perfect for back-to-school and
yeah let's just show you guys so the
first item is this figure out what this
is called for seconds this is an overall
dress and I person actually more
conservative at it to be more on a mana
side and conservative because that's
just how I feel more comfortable and I
just think that looks better cute so
many overall dresses I noticed are so
short like like if you bent over
everything I was so shocked to find an
overall dress that was like long and so
it comes like sits right above my knees
and it's a very pretty Aegis dinner
dress and this is so comfortable like I
didn't think it would be but it is like
a pretty stretchy denim and I love it so
much the next item I bought was I don't
you know the quality of it isn't
probably the best it could be it was a
little funny because it's clearly a
gilded teacher like the one who I had
Joanne's like it literally says building
on the time but then they like put on
their own print on it isn't it literally
a neon like construction Orange which on
the website it didn't really look like
that this is the one item that I
probably would say was a sale out of all
them then in the next item I got you
guys have seen at me where already but
it's because I love it and it's this
pink NASA t-shirt it has like the starry
night vitamin tobacco which is is a very
pretty painting and I thought it was
just so cool though they put on the NASA
logo and so itself is just like t-shirts
literally like they're so comfortable
it's next item I'm so sad because it
ordered in a size too small that's my
fault but if I didn't then I would be
winding this every day it's certainly a
yellow jump to and this reminds me so
much of Billy on thank God too big Billy
eyelash Billy like English space a
button-up yellow jumpsuit and I also
kind of look like the ones that like the
man in the yellow hat would wear from
Curious George they'e next I am I got to
wear these really pretty people kind of
in pajama pants but like I kind of like
it for that it's these like like look it
do it looks like an antique floral and
it's on this pretty green print and they
cinch at the waist and they're really
pretty pants they're super flowy and I
was for like a black turtleneck and it's
so pretty and I just felt so like will
be and I thought oh my god I've also
over one these probably are sick of
seeing them but I love them so much
under these two tones it jeans and you
guys have been asking where I got these
so they're from the so acidic shop these
are so awesome I love them so much and
I've not really seen anything like them
so the less I don't throw them at the is
so aesthetic shop already this jacket
and I wear it in my music favorites
video I think it's coast of music and I
love it for that it's like this longer
jacket a super puffy but like it's still
comfortable and it may be it's so warm
and that
yellow and that's come cold when I was
like filming that so it's perfect I
don't really know what this is on the
side like pockets like is this how I can
get the hot dog but like laying out but
I don't really know anyway so I love the
colors came on this too and it's just a
very pretty comfortable jacket so the
last store I purchased from was Graz
clubbing and I have been loving these
eyes lately so I purchased first
purchased these or these clothes
exercise leggings but they're really
cool exercise leggings because there's
like mesh cutouts on the side and they
just you know add to it and yeah I don't
think anyone could ever have enough
exercising because you know like I
always lose mine be a lot item on this
entire hallway we know that is not like
such a giveaway on the last item of this
like current haul is this I got another
jacket and it's this windbreaker like
sporty windbreaker and it's very pretty
