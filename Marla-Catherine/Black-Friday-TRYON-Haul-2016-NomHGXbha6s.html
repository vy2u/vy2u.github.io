video we are going to be doing a Black
Friday
Paul Black Friday is here and guess what
that else means to be spent on cool so
the three short time I'm shopping at is
awful
Daniel Wellington and forever 21 so if
first to top I got from forever 21 it
was this really cute turtleneck I loved
her locks so much and I think they're so
like they're so cute and this one is not
it's like cropped but it's not prop like
you don't see your stomach but it's just
like on the shorter side that makes
sense and then add to long sleeve it's
like um like strut really stretchy
fabric and so it's perfect for layering
so like no no we're and then you're like
a cute quote quote a coat okay so the
next topic for my on is the one I'm
wearing right now so you guys are gonna
do close-up but basically it is squad
all over it what's actually kind of
funny is I don't even have it really I
don't really have a squad so this is
like a shirt just to comfort me and make
me feel like so the next thing from
forever21
so mess of my space buns it's this super
cute um Sun Hat and you're probably like
Marla it's November like take a chill so
I got this super cute it's normally like
sixteen dollars and I got it for six
bucks so like yeah and then you don't
the extra one to assure you the products
that I got from it was gang a Wellington
they're kind enough to send me some
watches and I just want to show you guys
this one is from their new collection
the classic black so this is a unit
gender one and this is the unisex one so
this is a how you shadow I really really
love
gender-neutral watch from the new
classic black collection and this one is
specifically called Kwan well I actually
got this from my brother and he loved it
he thought her super comfortable and
stylish oh the last but certainly not
the least or was it from his Doppel
though I'm going to show you the first
item that I got neither inside out cuz I
already wore them they're so cute
they're in this dark wash but they have
these embroidered flowers start from the
pocket and then they slowly trail down
on to the other leg and I love them so
much that I got myself a pair except in
a light wash they're literally the same
like embroidered flowers but they're in
a light wash and I just thought these
were they're honestly so cute the next
product I got from duffel was this shirt
that I thought was so funny it's it is
um cropped style shirt that says hangry
and that has like a little angry shark
on there and it has a white collar and
then white sleeves
it's like color-block it's color blocked
and then the has like the blue the next
item I got from chocolate were these
joggers and I've already worn them even
though I got them today like I've worn
them already and I've wore the mountain
public they're literally the comfiest
things ever and they're super good
quality those is little they were inside
out too because I already own these days
look like regular navy blue but then on
the side they have this stripe and they
have these joggers have pockets and I
cannot tell you how happy I am whenever
I figure out that something has pockets
the next item I got from Zeljko I'm kind
of sad about because I ordered it in a
size too big I've seen so many bloggers
wear these and if I would have bought
this in the right size and we've been so
much cuter but it still is it's this
sweater and it's knitted great it came
in like a gray color and then a green
color looks like a regular sweater but
then you move on to the sleeves they're
like all fanned out like the ad style
which is so cute so the next item that
proves awful is this shirt that I kind
of got for not not for my brother but
like it was inspired I kind of got it
because of my brother because he always
tells me that whenever he's mad at me he
tells me to chill and it's the crop
style once again and then it has tie-dye
and then on the front set the back so
cute and then the front is set Stachel
in black lettering that like looks all
droopy yeah you know you know the next I
have for example is this my mom's worn
this because it's a one size fits all
and so like everyone in my family I was
born already but it is this really cute
brown cardigan and it has like that knit
look super sick super comfy and super
warm especially for the cold season a
next time for example is I'm so excited
about but it's these kind of things
where they called faux Doc Martens
they're so cute and the quality of them
like I was expecting them to be kind of
flimsy but they are not going day
they're like very straight and they had
like a little small keel with this
really pretty maroon color and then they
lace up the next talk I got from duffle
was this office shoulder off off the
shoulder off the shoulder papa
basically it's really stretchy and it
has like long sleeve that like kind of
taper off very flowy and it's just black
and white pinstripes kind of like the
turtleneck that I got wow Marla like way
to go to get something that looks
exactly the same
the last clothing item I got was these
high-waisted jeans that are so cute so
cute and they are high-waisted like what
can I see more and they have all the
cute buttons that go up and they're like
pumpkin normal skinny jeans
these rings are from forever 21 but they
sold them at docile for a super good
profile like this rhinestones that some
of them are many rings some of them are
just real ones
okay so that's a wrap for this hole
thank you guys for tuning in and staying
to the end and that's it so thanks guys
for tuning to my Black Friday haul

Wellington be safe on Black Friday and

born but then you see the Bishop Heelan
