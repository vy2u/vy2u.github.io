today studio is going to be a braces Q&amp;amp;A
I got my braces on back in June and it's
I got my braces I'm June 6 and it's
October 23rd
no it's not Rory here it's offered we're
28th let's check all 9 school proms a
lot of you guys have been asking
questions lately so I just like to
answer them and give it to you guys so
also if you guys hear any like we're
clunking sound or chainsaws or whatever
is because we're doing renovations on a
house and without further ado let's get
into the video the first question is
asked by angeleka Jong or are probably
the wrong she asked do you think you'd
better with braces on or before you have
them think I looked better before
because my teeth were crooked but now
it's my teeth are crooked and the braces
on them and so I think I looked better
before but obviously when I get them off
I'll look better and so yeah so I answer
your question I think I looked better
before I got the braces next question I
asked asked by Cobie ja she asked our
braces worth it I'm getting braces soon
but I don't think I want them anymore
and I think braces are worth it because
it's like if you're self-conscious about
your teeth like yeah you might not feel
like the most confident with your braces
but that's like not forever like you
know the arista we're going to get come
off sooner or later and then you want
like really nice teeth so yes I do think
braces are worth it so when asked what
color bands are your favorite getting
them changed soon I want to know what
you think person personally if I were
able to get colored bands I'd want to
get purple based bands like blues and
purples and you know because it purple
contrasts with yellow and it kind of
cancels it out makes your teeth wetter I
do not have coloured bands I just have
the bright kids and then they have
little doors on them where the wire
snaps in and a lot of you guys on the
braces video we're asking me like why
didn't they put bands on that's just
what my orthodontist do they don't
really put on bands unless you're
getting like a power shade or something
so yeah if you when you're getting your
braces when you're getting your colored
bands make sure you guys try to get more
purple base and try
avoid wide I heard that if you get wide
that like when you eat certain foods it
changes to the color and it works really
weird you just go up with braces and
answer your question yes I do if you're
a Buddhist Ali dancer as do you break
the rules when it comes to eating food
so yes I do break some rules when I've
seen food like apples I still eat them
even though I'm not supposed to but be
careful with that because I have broken
off my brackets before and I've popped
it with my wire twice and it's been kind
of scary a bit didn't hurt it was scary
though and so we were full thought um so
yes I do break the rules but I do try to
avoid like caramel and those drug stuff
cuz it's not that like I don't want to
eat them or whatever but it's just a
pain in the butt to get that out of your
braces so that's why I try to avoid them
um Ava Karen asks did you choose braces
over Invisalign and no I did not have
the option of the Invisalign I bet I
could've but I just did I didn't really
want Invisalign because I heard that be
like it's if the process ends up being
longer in the long run because like from
taking it out when you eating and like
taking out I don't so I just end up
going with the braces if you guys have
the option of getting Invisalign or
braces and you're like a teenager like
me then I would go with braces because
like everyone has braces when your
teenager and honestly like it's not that
bad and the process is faster when they
are asked do you hate them or do you
ever wish that you can take them off um
I feel like I'm I don't really hate my
braces I I've been one I've been going
to the orthodontist since I was six like
getting like every six months going to
get a check-up and so like the braces
were long awaited and so now that I have
them I like just grateful to have them
so I don't really hate them and for a
second off do you wish that I could take
them off obviously I wish I could like
have them off and just have that done
with over with but like no not really
because I think like the only time I
would consider like ripping them off is
when I've just got them tied in
didn't like hurts really bad probe Oh
hairdos I'm asked why do you get yours
off I get mine off um I don't know for
sure cuz Maya with an on says you could
get them up in as soon as like nine
months some people get them off in two
years or he says that my maximum would
probably be about two years and so um
which is I guess like average but I'm
really hoping that my teeth make speed
up the process and then in Austin I can
get them off and like marcher able not
be so awesome
but actually I went to go get I went to
my last checkup and they were talking
about like you know to get a thicker
wire to like level up on the wires and I
was in able to because I have one too in
this too often not blue like I still
have not lost one tooth and they don't
want to like upgrade my wires and then
my golet's and lose a tooth and then
have to degrade the wires if that makes
any sense but so I'm not I smell the
same wire I've had the same wire for
four months now someone asked where were
you excited or nervous to get them your
braces and did they hurt obviously they
did hurt but like if you popped in an
Advil like you'd be fine I think the
most painful is the day after you get
them because like your teeth are all
like what is going on like it hurt ee
anything but that's totally normal and
even my teeth i feel like all my teeth
really all my teeth were loose in so
like I feel like if I could take a plier
I couldn't pull them out really easily
that sounds gross but like that's
totally normal
Brendon Willy asked on a scale one to
ten how much do you hate with the inside
of your cheek weathers itself into the
corner bracket um I hate I'm going to
say lovin I hate so much when you like
because I have the books because I am
going to be getting fans but not for a
while um but I have the books and know
them heart on my
she like when I'm talking and it's so
