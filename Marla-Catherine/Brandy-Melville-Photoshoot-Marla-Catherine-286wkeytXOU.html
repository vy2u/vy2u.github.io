letting my cool set right now so I've
had rush them really but I'm not ready

it's something so much fun we are
packing up our suitcases because right
after the shoot we head to the airport
go home so we're currently here at the
car rental place to pick up our car and
then we're gonna drive over to Santa
Monica it's me so much fun I like had a
coffee tack in the uber ride so we got
our rental car and we're now in the car
obviously so we're on our way there
we're supposed to be there in like 7
minutes so that's yeah like 7 or 10
minutes it's so it's super exciting but
we're showing off like about an hour
early that we can make go shopping
around and just kind of relax at the
beach before we go and then we're gonna
head to the shoot and I'll be so much
fun I'm so excited I don't even know
what to do
yeah and then we're shooting with lily
and she's one of the photographer's and
I just stopped
Oh
we are now here but we're probably going
to go and eat some food because I ate a
lot of fruit for breakfast but fruit
isn't very filling and I'm still hungry
so we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna
go where's my camera so we're currently
at Cafe great I'm probably just gonna
order oatmeal honestly because I don't
want to be too full for this shoot like
I don't want to feel bloated oh look at
the Apple Store so we are now here at
the location it's literally like right
in there I went to look cute dog so
we're at the Santa Monica brandy
Melville and I'm super excited so let's
go ahead and so we're actually behind
the store right now they took us through
and I'm going to their studio right now
which is like right next to it
so we're currently here at the studio
and I think they're playing Billy
eyelash
so I'm really putting my bond
okay so I just did that first like to
shoot or whatever is inside the actual
studio and now we're heading outside it
and so I'm wearing this really cute
long-sleeved top so he just wrapped up
at that shoe and now I'm gonna go shop a
little in there would've been so much
fun such a good experience so I'm Carly

staff is so nice there okay
