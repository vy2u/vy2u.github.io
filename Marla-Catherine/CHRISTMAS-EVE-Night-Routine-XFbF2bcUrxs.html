the snare Shawn yeah I'm on the because
I beat those dumb enough hey guys it's
Marla and before I start into anything
let me just let you know that YouTube
has been clearing out some subscribers
randomly and I would hate for you guys
to like not be subscribed so make sure
you guys are and hit the little bell
while you're at it because WG is
notified when I post make me first and
so make sure you subscribe and so
basically today's video is going to be
at my Christmas Eve edition at night
routine I love my routines at morning
routines at you guys seem to awesome and
so so why not do my Christmas Eve night
routine and what I do to prep myself for
Santa Claus and its reindeer to come so
yeah without further ado let's get into
the video first up is making Santa Claus
sub cookies and you obviously have to
make the delicious kinds you know the
ones from Walmart those can never
disappoint and you put them inside of
the little white mixing bowl and then
when you mix them they should look like
poop because then you know you're doing
it the right way when they look like
poop so let's spray your pan actually
don't because I followed the directions
wrong then you're gonna scoop your
little cookie dough balls into the pan
and then you're gonna put them into the
oven at 375 degrees because it's
delicious and nutritious and while those
are baking I'm going to turn on my
Christmas movie which is Santa Claus and
Santa Claus and never disappoints and
Santa Claus is just reliable and then I
take out my cookies
and these turned out so bad like I
honestly they look fine but they do not
taste fine these tastes like crap
I've burned coffee now after making my
cookies I have to get into my Christmas
pajamas and these are ones ghetto ones
from Walmart
and close the pompons and then you have
to take off your makeup and I did didn't
show that because it's really boring but
then I put on this really cool face mask
I can't mom no my mom asked me to take
out the trash and I refused because of a
rubble child hashtag not a face and then
she threw them at me and I took them out
while out it hurry then I came back and
I look like an abused child my promise
I'm not and then the shark hair fell he
and then I punched my sister in the face
because it's just part of my daily
routine then I brushed my teeth because
like I said before it will taste like
vomit if I don't cuz my breath I don't
know what's wrong with it then I go to
bed and wait for Santa Claus to come
