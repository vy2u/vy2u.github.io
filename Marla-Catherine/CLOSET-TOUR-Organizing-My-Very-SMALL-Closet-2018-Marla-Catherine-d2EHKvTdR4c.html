today I'm going to be doing my closet
tour so here I have mm and then yeah I
don't know um I don't know I think this
is a scarf no I think those are pajama
pants um yeah I don't know what is
inside of that bucket mm-hmm so yeah I
hope you guys liked this video if you
liked it subscribe like today's video is
gonna be all about my closet I you guys
have been requesting the closet tour so
much it's like ridiculous I don't I
don't know why cuz I don't have like a
big closet anything it's actually quite
small I have a lot of clothes that need
to be organized this will actually
motivate me to like clean my closet so
in this video is gonna be closet tour
and my process of organization on how to
fix my closet because I probably did not
mess up this closet for this video it
literally has been like this for the
past couple months and it's getting out
of hand and I don't know where to fit
clothes anymore and yeah let's just get
started it's probably to be a little bit
longer so let's roll with the clip okay
so I don't even have any bins to
organize anything or anything right now
I'm just literally decluttering of what
I want and don't want
I was naked with you and I realized I
was me too okay so I have all of my okay
hold on I have all of the clothes that
were currently in the closet that we're
hanging up I have those sorted so these
are the ones I'm gonna be donating or
figuring out like getting rid off those
are the jeans that I'm keeping my
t-shirts and then those are some light
jackets I still need to go through this
I'm not even really close to being done
hold on let me show you yes don't you
just know I'm just in love with acne
okay so you thought that my closet was
starting to get better mm-hmm no there's
the start of it yeah I have all these
clothes down here to the need to figure
out what is going on with so hashtag
love life oh my gosh you sound like a
skunk's going in the woods for the most
part I'm pretty sure we want to keep my
city clothes down here but I gotta
figure that out so I'm gonna know do
that yes that green and purple
background it was for a video that I was
gonna film
okay so this is the pile of clubs I'm
gonna be decluttering from this pile and
then I saw this table to go through but
I'm pretty sure I'm keeping everything
on this table and stuff so for next the
next step from the next step for me
inside my closet I now need to hang up
all this and figure out what deal is
with this and then I'm going to have to
remove this shelf it's honestly more of
a burden than a help like it just takes
up space and then after I do that I'm
going to go through up here which will
be lots of fun okay so I'm here with my
friend Abbi oh my dad came home from
work and he brought home the closet
organization stuff inspired by Emma
Johansson I think it's her last name
anyway she's awesome and I saw these in
one of her closet organizing yeah it's
not a closet organizing I'm just gonna
you know what I mean anyway but I saw it
in her video and I was like I want that
I need that he's miles
actually real quick before I start the
montage I know I'm gonna be doing like a
closet tour why did I do that I'm
actually doing a closet tour I just
wanted to quickly show you guys what the
deal is I bought two of them and then I
connected them because they come with
these connector things I actually really
really like this I'm now working on
actually cleaning my room and finishing
up organizing and hanging up stuff so
that's the dealio I never even said
he'll never mind hey guys so it is the
next day well it's the next morning and
it's actually almost 12:30 and I am just
now starting to organize my closet I
didn't go to school today because it was
a field trip a school field trip and my
closet is coming along I feel like it's
kind of been a long process for me just
like I don't know what what's the deal
with cleaning but it's hard for me so
wish me luck
and that is a wrap I just finished up
doing my closet it snowing like crazy
outside mm-hmm like you can't even see
I'm now gonna do my closet tours so
let's get into it so this is what the
outside of my closet looks like I have a
little hook right there that has my
miniature y'all robbing clunking
backpack or whatever I really really
love this backpack it's like it are
basically used as a purse so once you
open up my closet doors once you open up
my closet doors here is an overview of
the closet my closet is on the smaller
side so I tried to declutter as much as
possible I'll show you guys where the
rest of my shoes are in a second but
these are just two that didn't fit and
these are my go to shoes and I really
really love these New Balance one so I
just have them down there and then I had
this box
tucked away over here that has just a
bunch of hats that I really never wear
but don't want to get rid of because
they like sentimental value or whatever
and then I have this and this is what I
got that organized and saved my closet
I'll try to find the name of what this
is actually called I know it's from Ikea
and I'll try to find the name of it and
put it like on the screen or something
wait I don't even know what you call it
like an organizer I know but this is
what those drawers are called antonius
educate anyway so this is the Antonius
shelving unit and I bought two they're
like $20 and so that's actually not that
bad at all so starting off it down here
I have all of my swimsuits because I do
have quite a few I've been working with
since when two companies lately so they
sent me a lot and I just wanted to put
them in all in one place
so that will be super nice when the
summer time actually comes and then the
next drawer is full of sweaters like
from brandy melville or thrift it or
just something about sort sweaters that
I like to wear and then the next drawer
has even more sweaters then the next
drawer is filled with pants and jeans I
wear but like not too often I take that
back I wear a lot of these super often
this one has mostly leggings and sweats
these sweats are so so soft these are
from Bernie Melville these are from blue
and gray it's not Luke I agree it's blue
and gray so it's from Raj and they slide
in and out pretty easily considering
they're only 20 bucks I feel like this
is a really sturdy unit then
next one has even more genes this is my
ugly t-shirt no never mind this is my
pajama drawer and I just have to my
favorite pajama tops to wear and then my
pajama pants and then I have this draw
right here which is on top because it
has the most stuff because it's filled
with just t-shirts that I like to wear
and then it's stronger on the entire
unit just done in the front I have these
fairy lights that are from Urban
Outfitters I believe and Wow that the
cinematography but literally I just
think it just adds to it makes the
closet look cute even though I'll cause
it really isn't really ever seen so now
onto the left side of my closet I have
these jeans are like my go-to s and I
also didn't have enough space for them
but inside of the drawer but I also
didn't want these getting wrinkly these
are more pants that I didn't want to get
wrinkly or like wrinkled easier and then
I have some overalls and then it moves
on to some sweaters I have this one from
nowadays and I literally love it so much
like that is so cute they're like pastel
primary colors another crewneck sweater
which is actually my March that was so
annoying I'm so sorry and then on the
right side of this dresser thing I have
jackets I've this one from the so stetic
shop which is so cute reminds me
stranger things and this thrifted Nike
windbreaker windbreaker
from Bernie Moe votes the classic like
red white and blue striped one my sister
has seen me wear this before and she's
not asked for it back so I guess it's
mine now and then there's a big teddy
bear coat or poopy jacket as Emma
Chamberlain would say then these are
three hoodies that I don't work too
often but I don't want to get rid of
these bands that I believe my mom caught
them for me and I think they're from
Target but they just help to organize
like my pain that's like fabric and
embroidery stuff random pens and pencils
randomness more randomness so it's I
don't know and then I have my memories
box and I got this from Ikea it's just a
green box and I got some stickers and
put the word memories on it
I literally just talked so much I don't
click a sweaty Pig that wraps up my
organizing my closets lush closet tour
why do I keep mine doing that slash the
closet tour so I hope you guys enjoyed
it there's a little motivational quote
okay I'm sorry if you didn't like this
but you guys were crushed it all the
time so I was like why not do it why not
post it and that is about it for today's
bitch you my next one subscribe if you
