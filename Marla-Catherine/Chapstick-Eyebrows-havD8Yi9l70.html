it's Marla and they took Leon's video
today's video is going to be Chesley bro
so this trend called so gross has been
going around and you need to glycerin
soap for that but I don't have that so I
was kind of experimenting and seeing
what I could use instead of using the
clear soap and I found out that
chapstick works really well so basically
today's video is due to a tutorial on
how to do with traffic growth so what
you're going to need is obviously some
chapstick and then a spoon I got mine
from Sephora just like the tester ones
they have in the boxes so you guys grab
like ten of them for free this is
optional but you can like actually use
bra product so to start off make sure
your eyebrows with no pod and then
because that's what you're supposed to
do so I'm going to be showing you guys
with brow product and chapstick and then
just traffic alone so on my left eye
roll just echo I'm going to be doing
just Trump stick so I just brush them in
with the screaming so then you can
either take roll of your chopstick and
then take your spoolie and rub it
through there if you want not too much
product and then you can brush them your
eyebrows just to like get them started
but I like to just take my chapstick and
roll them over my eyebrows
and they just get all the product on
there and then you can work your way
through it with your soui and shape it
to how you like I feel like this just
make your eyebrows feel and look so much
thicker did you save your eyebrows it
look a lot thicker and fuller and it's
also very natural so they're all about
that natural look then go ahead and do
this it's super fun to like play looks
like chapstick
my chapstick is also very buildable so
if you want a lot heavier look then
Admiral chapstick and if you just want
it a little bit than just rub it on your
Schooley and I brush it through a quote
before after ill-effects to look such as
like on the camera okay it looks darker
too if you like it's kind of like
cherrybrook some way let make your
eyebrows look like they're wet and so it
kind of makes some darker it literally
just makes you look like you have tumblr
eyebrows so this before and after we'll
do a close-up and this is just with only
chopstick no product whatsoever so now
I'm going to do and I'm going to do this
eyebrow with a brow product and traffic
so once again just start out with a
clean brow
your smoothie and after that you're
literally just filling your eyebrows how
you regularly do your oath okay so this
is what my eyebrow looks like filled in
without any chopsticks so now I'm going
to do the same thing I did on my natural
eyebrow with chopstick to the same thing
on the one at wit brow products so this
is if you just like feeling a little
crazy so I grew up a few q-tips and
extension chips
chapstick if it gets a little messy it
just wipes off that's it that's
literally it so so this eyebrow is with
no product but a little bit of chapstick
and then this eyebrow has a little bit
of product and a lot of chapstick so
this is what the final result is going
to be looking like right you play with
it thanks guys for watching I hope you
enjoyed it and please try out these just
grows like crunch tag Novogratz if you
guys see what we create them ago take a
pic and time you Twitter inside whatever
shares long time name and I'd like to
see them and at PS we're going to be
doing a video every single day this week
basically I'll see you tomorrow so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
