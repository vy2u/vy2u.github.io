back to Marla Kathryn for today's video
it is going to be a Christmas wishlist
2016 and these videos have been going
around and I thought they were great
idea because first off like I never know
what to ask my parents for Christmas
I love you guys and let's get into the
video so the first thing I want for
Christmas on my list
anyway so yeah so first thing I want for
Christmas is paint
I just preferably acrylic and because I
would love to feet with a click but
watercolours want to the nice thing I
want for Christmas is a record player
I think record players are so cute and
they also just like you know my sister
was like saying how like if you ask
someone like Oh where's the music coming
products like oh the record player
thanks tell them my Urban Outfitters and
they had like this baby p1 that was so
cute if I already get a record player I
would want to get into some vinyls and
what I would want to get is glass
animals their album is amazing and it
fits I think zabba I don't know but
that's the name of the artist and glass
animals is the name of their album
they're the people that make this song
Dewey if you guys know and then the next
time I know I'd like to get is Lorde's
pure heroin heroin and then the next one
I'd want to get is Lana Del Rey's born
to die although her voice is so like
mysterious and pretty and on a record
player that would have like you know
like that just be so pretty so the next
thing I want for Christmas is a canon
g7x my mom already has one too but it's
hard to bother when she's blogging so
you know it'd be kinda nice to have my
own canon g7x
and also I feel so bad because my watch
channel is kind of dead like the videos
are kind of boring and it's the reason
why is because I just don't know what to
blog or for a second off I have the
iPhone 5 only 16 gigabytes I like can
only have two photos and that
since I need to believe in that so
Lansing classic white Morel so the next
thing I want for Christmas is me I want
to myself eating plants and succulents
and the reason why is because first up I
think they're so cute so still cute I
want to get some artificial ones I'm in
the process of decorating my room right
now and I think that'd be so awesome to
have just like go at your plants like
bring the outdoors in you know the next
thing about be awesome to get for
Christmas is a tapestry and I plan on
just buying this myself but I'm just
giving it out there cuz that bee and I
stayed here for you guys
so anyway Urban Outfitters has this
really huge tapestry that I want to get
that I can not DIY but I want to get it
so bad it's like 40 bucks so it's not
too bad but I'll insert a picture of it
it's a stay-home and that's totally like
me is I just want to stay home and so I
thought they'd be so cute for like above
my bed or something cute yeah the next
thing I want is gift cards obviously
I'll be all these but I think gift cards
are so like if you're especially if
you're getting it for someone else and
you just don't know what to get them ask
them what their favorite stores and then
go get them like a 20-buck gift card
yeah um preferably the stores I want to
get one get a gift credit is forever 21
hmm and probably Aeropostale and the
reason why I say are possible is because
I go there jeans not really their shirts
but I love their jeez my mom I can get
back row or something yeah it's like
Everts you try cracking it oh okay the
next thing I want is a phone for more
big a bite space mom I can't even wad
mom because this is 16 gigabyte you know
but I'm so grateful I just like to say
thank you anyway so the next thing you
want for Christmas is my self tanner I'm
so why I blend dad was that modest so
the next thing I just went up disagree
like I'm so white and it's not okay I
what's funny is that like I'm gonna be
very white or into someone and also I'm
like tan during the winter like what so
but I want to get it specifically they
state trope is true it client Q in the
80s so what ad s the next thing I want
for Christmas is any optical glasses I
already have glasses and they are
prescription but they're the square
shape and sometimes I'm not in the mood
for square circle the next thing I want
for Christmas is some lush bath bombs
lush bath bombs are so like magical and
majestic and I just want them so bad so
the next thing I want for Christmas is
some lush bath bombs and um they're
majestic like all the videos on
Instagram are like lush bath bombs and
like let me take this little like
majestic thing and put it in the water
and let it like watch explode they're so
cool they even have like a black one I
wouldn't want to get that one though I'm
scared the next thing I want for
Christmas is the honest eyes Niobrara
honest Aussie oh did I just say I've
literally 96 times so the next thing I
want is some honest eyes your brow
pomade I probably just said all that
wrong and the next thing I want is some
more brushes all of my brushes I feel
like not that I'm putting down elf but
like they're all the elf brand and I
just need some better ones or at least
just more because I feel like all mine I
use the same brush for everything so the
alas but certainly not the least feed is
a macbook air rose gold but i want one
so bad i do my online school in that
back corner over there I wanted to
spanners um yeah it's yeah the whole
dream of on that school is like being in
bed during school but now I have to come
down here and thank you guys so much for
