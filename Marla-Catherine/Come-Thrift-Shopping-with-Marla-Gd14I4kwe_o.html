doing another searching blog because you
guys have been asking if we're more of
them and so I'm going to be doing them I
also this is gonna be the first like
official video where I'm showing my
series my 15 series because I want to be
taking you guys along and this will be
like the first official video because I
know I've done this um like older there
can videos anyway so I'm not now in the
parking lot to my first two are and the
Lord guide asked where I go and I go to
di it's a Utah baster store there's a
lot of locations in Utah Idaho and I
think of you in California but it's my
favorite this Shore to go to because
it's super clean and everything's pretty
much at a uniform price so a lot of guys
always ask that and so I just thought
into that out of the way but now we're
in the parking lot to there and we're
about to head in it so sorry
so today I am looking for orange
t-shirts and more mom jeans and I really
want to find another pair of overalls
because overall just feel comfortable so
let's hope that I find some so I once
again I in the jeans because I want
other people to catch because I'm
looking for high-waisted mom jeans or
juice it's like a workout to look good
another tip is for third thing is a lot
of people say to go often but if when in
reality there's not too many things like
new things being donated so I got a
really couple weeks because I've been
like almost everything's like cleared
out and if things are there who smells
apologies right now I just want to pair
an almost they're going to fit but I
just found one in the rally Eddie Bauer
and they're the authentic with denim and
they got that cute patch so I really
hope you fit so thirsty after the day I
want to wear some to easy that way when
I'm changing it's not like a big hassle
so I got is teaching on some sample a
shorts from boohoo and sandals from go
change
sometimes I find really useful on jeans
for the online site
I am in d2o next section I hate look
this is brand new seen John's they like
text on why do they look how many they
have like mass production here Paulie is
gonna be sold at brandy Melville and
like tears and to be $100 so just saying
my like a friend start the trend so
we'll have a pound and punch we're in
the more section ops everything's really
good future
hey maybe not you have to pour it it's
going cheap for it that's looking book a
monster you can't get any more plans
so I charge my t-shirts for Marla and
like any of a fourth of July sure you
like vintage things other why might that
one and you know those are like
high-dollar what's Hollister Palmer
Amish needs to find some sort that go to
her ankles so I'm going to now go try
everything on I like this but if you
guys have been a little bit I do my
house like a half till next this is only
like to the best time to do which is
hoping to during the summer because
everyone's like decluttering so I'll
just Siri but I'm going to like this
super warm and it's a nice brand and I
really like to like the white trimming
and the white discuss this is super cute
I like I don't know how I've seen it
somewhere but you can say in 10 so this
is the horse t-shirt I'm pretty sure
this is also construction brand but I
like it connects pecking like more like
a muted orange I like this one like a
burnt orange red just I really like
these but they're under your little
pricey so I don't know I can already
I really like these but they are a
little high tiers and get a little bit
girl I feel like the bell-bottoms cute
sometimes it's not stay they're playing
or spring line so I were really trying
to eat this or you lose some we're going
to get light up one item to go in what I
am bit I liked it this little bad boy
kind of so I am right now let's go to
the checkout line
