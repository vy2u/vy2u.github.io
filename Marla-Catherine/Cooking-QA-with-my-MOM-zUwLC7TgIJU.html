that she is hey guys is Marla today
we're going to be doing a QA or cookie
dinner so today's gonna be a Q&amp;amp;A
featuring at my mother so we do have a
family blogging channel and it's called
with these seven Henry's and and I'll
link down to it down below in the
description box and we're also a
partnering with a loafer - which I'm
super excited thought I saw a few other
eateries that really loved watching do
it and I was so excited when they
reached out anyway we also did ask you
guys to ask these questions to honor my
infinity and so there's a lot of them
and I'm super excited to get to them and
if not further ado let's just get on
into this video hello fresh send us some
of their meals and we're gonna be making
where we're gonna make the pork we're
not vegan
we love our meat if you guys want $30
off your first week of deliveries from
Hollow fresh go visit their hell fresh
calm and then enter in the code of Marla
30 and their doors off so we are making
the honey glazed pork no noise and I let
my mother take care of this because I'm
not very good at cooking
so the first question is who made our
usual comfort
so the bird must first review guys is to
start a YouTube channel first and we've
started in our YouTube channel it's well
Evelyn do know you're saying too much
too much
I had my channel first it actually was
called Rhonda Lynne and then I started
to family vlog Channel seven Henry's
hold it how did your mom react or how
did you so the second question is how
did your mom react to you wanting to
start a new channel since I'm already
have one she's pretty lean about you
having one was she caught you
well thanks for though she picked me up
at the pet store when she say she was on
sale I was in the clearance the bargain
bin so we just rinsed the potatoes sweet
potato and we're gonna cube them up
let's see now you are good at peeling
let's see if you're good at cutely my
favorite things about Marla she really
has no no no no first you'd the bad ones
oh well bad things well I'm actually
really dry she's so dramatic you guys
I'm not dramatic she only cries I don't
quite see first everything so she
interrupts a lot not know I don't
that is bad about her and I think we all
do it in our family so she's not alone
she not only one but she does interrupt
let's just say right there okay so good
things about Marla is what do you think
about it
oh really hope hey I'm here why would
you should be blowing on your mouth ah
let's see
good things about Marla is that she is
she's very light hearted Barla something
good about Marla is if you threatened
her she does exactly what you want her
to do I like that surrender her
yesterday I said follow your line for 24
hours if your bedroom stop clean trash
was not taken out and the dishes are put
away when I got home it was all done
it's very clear Marla is like my perfect
child
you can ever buy a pet store we love you
there's just so many good things that
it's hard to narrow it add one thing
like important notes otherwise you're
not something my husband and I met at a
service project it was actually on a
state level that means many many single
words we're supposed to come and only
three showed up me and another girl and
my husband Oliver okay we've got the
sweet potatoes all cooked we need to
toss them in a bowl with some olive oil
so we're going to toss a little
a little bit of salt no Peter okay first
of all that I couldn't come up with any
good to save up brother you're like if
I'm going to school with my mom I
probably you know most people are like
like they're like Holloway buddy it's
like you always have item in the home so
the next thing we're gonna do is just
put the sweet potatoes on one half and
we're gonna bake them at 425 for about I
know there's like 12 or 15 minutes I
think helpers it's awesome because
everything comes pre-measured so that
way there's absolutely no waste of food
which is really important because we
should all be eating our food and not
wasting it
hello pressure is also super awesome
because every single meal is super
portable so although they're cooking
actually show you guys this is a pretty
big box
he was just like insulation and this was
for free it shipped my as shift my door
super fast and everything was still cold
when I opened it up so it's not a super
awesome and I mean who doesn't like fast
free moving so Mara's putting olive oil
in the pan we're just gonna sear at the
pork tenderloin right now so what's the
sweet potatoes come out of the oven they
still like 10 minutes to cook but I'm
going to add the green beans right next
to them what are we gonna be probably I
usually don't dress up I was hearing
like some people they're just in the
literally just dressing like spider-man
I just wear like the skin-tight costume
nice so funny don't forget to use your
hot pad when you're putting your oven
that goes in for another 10 minutes
chick-fil-a cubbies
um so I personally think I you like all
night school there well I'll tell you
right now I had a hard time with her
going to all night school like doing all
night school I did not want her to in
the beginning she baked me and again I
might go for a really easy mom
kind of making it sound like
like I see I ain't know but then somehow
they'll twist my you know me to do next
you know I could say how I feel about
something that I actually really care
about my kids feel about it - I don't
work full time so it was nice having her
home and I was home and I missed that
all in I want her happy and I think
she's happy being back in so now we have
seared the pork and we're gonna go put
it like we've see if no scientific said
now we're gonna go and put it into the
oven to bake color french makes
everything self self explanatory and
their instructions come with pictures
and so it's super easy to follow and
then from genes cute well there's a
family that we knew my husband tonight
back when we were dating I like took
their daughter's name it was actually
Myrna but when she was born
Myrna didn't feel right and I thought of
the name Marla and that just stuck so
that's why I need Roberta oh I don't
want to think about that we're all
having a boyfriend i we have a role our
mom 16 enough so she's obviously like
two years from that and she's okay with
that I don't tell my traditions we
really have no tradition through coming
dish uh no we do have family choose
every one day that's not true you know
and the a piano dinner and family
tradition is once a month we get
together as my medical wing tradition
