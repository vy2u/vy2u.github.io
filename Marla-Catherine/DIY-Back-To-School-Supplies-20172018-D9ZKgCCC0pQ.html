DIY school supplies so in my last video
which was exclusive West Hall I think
maybe it was Matthew but I showed it
some Jer wife looks like that I've made
it some notebooks and you guys really
like them so I decided to make a video
on them I would also like say thank you
to the five miles apps for sponsoring
this video so it's basically an app you
can use for back-to-school and I like to
think of this app is kind of like an
online thrusting up because it has like
in the sense that you can buy you stuff
for a really cheap or a lot cheaper than
what it normally was you can buy items
like laptops cell phones backpacks which
make Becca school shopping a lot less
like yours or you can use the fun log up
for selling your own apprentice on here
to make extra cash for bus to school
shopping this app and it's different
than other like pine-sol ups because
they're legit like users like your users
like yourself that are buying and
selling stuff I think it this up it is
so cool and I think you guys should also
go download it it's free I'll have a
link in the description box to go check
it out they're also currently hosting a
giveaway on our app and so I'll have
more information about that in the outro
so an offer that you're looking on into
the COI video so this first DIY is
really a cute notebook it's my favorite
one out of all of these it's this like
butterfly collage one and all you need
is some like Brown looking paper some
like cutout of whatever you're going to
want to be on there Mod Podge and like
old sponge and a notebook but you just
take down your Mod Podge Newmont apology
to your paper down so I chose just like
brown paper one like it looks like a
brown paper bag and I got this one for
like 50 Cent's of giants and then I just
glue that down it there on that to be
notebooks and it these little like
cutouts of butterflies and flowers I
also got from Joanne's and it was like 4
bucks something like that but I these
are so cute and I did a notebook like
this last year except I actually cut out
like
cutouts from magazines and that took
forever so this took so much like less
time and I thought this one turn up here
I then cut off the excess edges and I
then Mod Podge with that down that way
nothing was up and that completes this
notebook this one is my favorite and I
think it is so pretty like it just looks
like pretty looks like a garden or
something
flowering and the reason why I'm on
topology on top two is because they make
sure like none of the corners of the
little cutouts lift up or anything so
this next DIY is this it was kind of a
fail but at the same time it wasn't
you're going to need for it is some
vinyl paper I think I'm saying I don't
know vinyl paper a notebook and like
something to cut it with so I take out
the vinyl like sticker paper and it's
just really cool holographic one that
like looks blue and then pink and
whatever and then I cut it with one of
these like actual professional clothing
because I wanted it to be straight and
then if what I done went to my notebook
and then that's literally it
I had a half off coupon code first it
was only like five bucks
this stuff was it's super cool but it's
really hard to put onto the notebook so
I'd recommend I would like start to use
scissors and then I realized I would
need a roller so I had like a bunch of
creases and it's a little sheer so you
can still see like the logo of the
notebook behind it but like who cares it
still looks super cool and you're
definitely not going to lose this
notebook this next Nick but Nick this
next in notebook is like this studded
one so I got some black paper some
sequins a hot glue gun some scissors and
Mod Podge you know in a notebook that's
what you're always going to need but I
then it glue down the paper once again
and this one it is a little bit more
time-consuming but it's super like
personal like you can make it super
customized and how do you want it but I
took these really cute a gold star
sequins I got also from Joanne's I this
is not sponsored by joins but I would I
got everything from drones and you just
arrange your stars how you want them and
hot glue them down
so this next and last one is kind of
it's a joke
so don't don't at me but but I bought
this like it was fifty cents for to
passive circle near so I just had to but
you just hot glue down your mirrors into
the notebook and then you have on your
notebook so you can check yourself out
in class make sure everything's looking
fresh and also turn I lied the last one
was not lost one this is the last one so
it's you're going to need some paper
some pencils some eyelet stickers and
acrylic paint in a paintbrush and you
just put down your eyelet stickers I got
these I I think I got these eyelets to
consult Walmart you just put onto your
pencils and then you take your acrylic
paint and you paint on the inside of the
eye Oh stickers so it basically makes a
bunch of like circles or you can be like
half moons or something this is a waste
of time don't do this one but it's still
fun to do so yeah and they didn't turn
out good but thank you guys so much for
