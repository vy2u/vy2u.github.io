guys it's Laura and today geo it is
going to be a doctor School of DIYs
hahahaha I can't dance I can't you I
can't dance like whatever they always do
the dancing like that one they were just
telling Marla Kelly so today is day two
I back to school supplies tumblr
inspired because I think that everyone
should enjoy school and it's easier to
enjoy school when you have cute boys and
they're like homemade and their special
into your tea burkhart not really
anyways let's just get right into the
video to start off you're going to need
three notebooks of any color but I
suggest all black because it's less
noticeable and you need some colorful
paper and any old magazines twine Mod
Podge and those like weird sponge foam
brushes or whatever and then I'm going
to take some tape just to hold down my
piece of paper temporarily and then I
measured it out with a piece of paper
with a piece of paper obviously with a
pen and then I cut it that cutted I'm
having a hard time speaking today sorry
cut it out and make sure it fits because
you do not want like this lopsided piece
of paper on your notebook that really
suck
make sure it's measured out correctly
and then kick your montage and it put
down doping on too much because then
I'll clump up but found the right amount
and smooth it out all in the same
direction that's my opinion it turns out
best put that down and smooth it out
with something like a ruler or just
something straight edge then if you want
more of a glossy sunshine then I would
suggest taking a little bit of Mod Podge
and just put that on the top and it
finish it off and make it super cute I
took some of this Baker's twine that's
in black and white and I took a very
very long piece and it's just done a
little bit confusing but you basically
take it half of the piece and put it on
the front and then when when you go to
the back you cross it and then you
thread it through and so it's like
facing back up again and then there
should be a cross on the back and then
when you flip it back up tiya an info
and then Mod Podge that go down that way
it sticks kind of like glue and it turns
out so cute and it looks like a little
like festive package the next notebook
is this more like a hipster like collage
from magazines and more of an
inspirational notebook so I just wanted
to took some old magazines and cut out
things that I thought were inspirational
or just looked cool and then you're
going to set it up how you want and take
a picture of that for reference later
swipe that all off and put a piece of
paper in between the actual notebook
cover and then the paper that way
doesn't stick take your Mod Podge and
put that down as like the glue and then
stick everything on using that reference
of the picture that you took earlier cut
off the excess edges or the stuff that
like just is hanging over and I suggest
using an exacto knife because it's a lot
easier but I didn't have one and make
sure you Mod Podge it but be careful and
not lifting up the edges the next
notebook is a American Apparel inspired
one and you take the text Helvetica type
out all the cities they use using a
picture as a reference and then you can
print that on you can print that out
onto some of that paper bag looking
paper and then do the same exact process
is the rest of the notebooks yes
I chose not to modpodge the type top to
make it so it's not glossy last and
final notebook is just this very simple
black and white grid and you Mod Podge
it then take your white piece of paper
and just simply draw a grid with a black
pen using a ruler you look so cute and
it's so easy
thank you guys so much for watching I
really dearly and truly hope you have
some new ideas and things that right

few more and binge watch my videos and
