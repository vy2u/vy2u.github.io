reviewing a full room tour because it's
fall
it has come a lot faster than I expected
it to but it did come and I'm so excited
because I do have to give away in this
video and I'm super excited about it I
think it's a really cute price so watch
the video if you want to find out about
that and then really quick I wanted to
tell you guys about my background or
answer some questions that you guys
always ask if this is a real brick wall
and no it is not it is wallpaper which i
think is really cool i found this
product at Target and then I reached out
to the company and they sent me some and
I'm so excited about it because I've
been loving it so this really cute
company called it divine color and they
just make like realistic looking
wallpaper and this specific one is the
white brick wall line if you guys wanted
to go purchase it yourselves they sell
them at Target
or I'll have a link down below and I
think this is a perfect way to like
spice things up without like being too
expensive and it's also all removable so
when it's painting let's get into the
video I'm so excited about this this
first DIY is a flower wall but it's fall
edition and this is my favorite I just
threw her so cute so what you're going
to need is a bunch of flowers I got mine
from the doll shortened from Walmart and
then you're gonna need a pair of
scissors and you're going to cut off the
majority of the stem but Lisa and that
way you can tape it I press my scissors
literally snapped in half I don't know
what happened they just did so I went
and got some garden light pliers and
then I cut those and this is what they
now look like and I'm gonna go take some
painters tape and I'm a normal e double
tape it that way it stays on the wall
better and I then tape them into however
I want you to the wall and I think this
is so pretty and super fall and I don't
get tired of looking at this I just
think it's so pretty
so these next ideas are not necessarily
DIYs but they are just ideas on how she
redecorated around that so this is a
plain area but I just added a gold pot
to my plan and I added some fall at
candles and like a little fall pumpkin
and this is all from the dollar store
and so it was super cheap and then fall
garland and no just like taking spaces
that are not necessarily decorated and
then adding some fall stuff to them
definitely helps with your not fall mood
and then this is a dollar store candle
and like it smelled good when I smelled
it and then when you like actually lit
it just started to smell like fire and
so I would not recommend those I also
added some fairy lights from Urban
Outfitters the I just think this is cute
and it's definitely very fall and super
cheap to do so this next idea is to take
a fall garland and then a like regular
green garden or whatever and you
intertwine them together and I put this
above my window and I'm struggling to
get it up but I finally did and above my
window I hung up this Daisy like wall
chain necklace it's from Urban
Outfitters and I just think it adds to
that look with the gold touch because I
feel like gold is super polish
and then this last one is this I took a
yellow bowl because that's all and then
I put in this foolish garland with along
with stomach candies and this is not
healthy because this is right next my
bed then I added another candle which
also just smelled like fire so not
recommend dollar store candles like
they're not good at all so this next one
is a custom photo board and print was
super kind and they sent me not only one
a per pocket for myself but a one to
also give away to you guys you don't
know what print pocket is they are the
super cute company that make these like
portable things where you can print out
photos almost immediately and so you can
upload the from your phone this is a
picture of me and a viewer that I met
and she was so nice it literally prints
out from that little device like right
then and there and it also it has a
sticky side so like if you want to make
it a sticker it can be a sticker and I
just love this device so much it's like
a Polaroid in the sense that you get the
photo instantly but you're able to
upload it from any from your phone and
so it's really any photo you want if you
guys want to win this other print pocket

Costco to and I just added those and

below cuz this is where I got all my
photos from and then I just added some
fake plants and things that I just
thought were special to me or I really
