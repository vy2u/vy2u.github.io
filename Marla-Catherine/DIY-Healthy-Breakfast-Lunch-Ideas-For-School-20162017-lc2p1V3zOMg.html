video is going to be easy DIY healthy
breakfast and lunches and this video is
extra exciting because it is a collab
with Tatiana Boyd her channel is their
words for it like honestly her channel

quality of her videos are so good she's
so pretty and she deserves all the
subscribers in the world so you guys

downbar go subscribe to her go watch her
video right after you watch it I know
that through n square I literally the
same thing I like a ham cheese stick in
an apple every day I got a little boring
so it's sometimes it's fun to mix it up
and I hope you guys enjoyed the video
and let's get right on into it our first
breakfast idea is healthy parfaits on
the go what were you're going to need is
just any jar of any size of how much you
want to eat your parfait this is
absolutely recycled lined up and it's
just an old ice cream container then
you're going to need some whatever
flavor of yogurt you want that I like
the original flavor and then some
blueberries or any fruit of your kind of
your choice like strawberries
blueberries group flag raises work great
and then Justin Bruno
you guys can make this the night before
and then chill it in the refrigerator
and it's super yummy and it's easy to
just grab and then you can eat it on the
car ride to school or school work
wherever you guys are going they next to
breakfast idea creep the next
improvement a Mexican breakfast idea is
a very yummy and healthy asset delicious
delicious delicious delicious easy
overnight oatmeal in the flavor cinnamon
roll and I cannot express to you guys
how much it actually tastes like
cinnamon roll and now I'm going to turn
the time over to my mom I feel like I'm
like in a prison presentation at school
or something wrong I'm gonna turn the
paper over to the teacher
no I'm gonna turn the time over to my
mom and she's actually gonna show you
guys how to make it
now when you blend it everything brought
the oatmeal so it should be super super
fluffy like creamy mixture you're going
to add your oatmeal in so I'll do that
and just also I want to add if you can't
have cream cheese an alternative to that
might be a vegan cream cheese it's just
a thought and so now you can just move
right in the blender okay so now that
you've got a jar ready and I just have
this it makes it cleaner if you don't
have it that's fine but I like to just
implement is called at home then I just
add your mixed oatmeal and liquid
mixture get all that goodness in there
