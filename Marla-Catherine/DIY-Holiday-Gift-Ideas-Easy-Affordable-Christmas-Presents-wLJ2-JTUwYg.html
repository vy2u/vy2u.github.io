um yeah I'm on the because the Pecos
dumb and the only speedy cuz I playing
with a son playing for the King playing
for the title I'm surprised you didn't
hear this in the Bible hey guys what's
up welcome back to mother Katherine in
today's video is going to be dia right
inexpensive chriskiss and just things
you can make at home and you might have
some of the supplies needed laying
around the house and also this video is
a collab with all you Rockville he makes
some very like fun funny cool
interesting videos and they're fun to
watch so if you guys want to go check
out his channel cuz he will actually
help be having some more ideas for DIY
things with some Christmas gifts and it
will have a link down in the downbar
let's get right into the video
first up is chalkboard clipboard what
you're going to need for this DIY is
some chalk paint some painters paint
painters tape a clipboard some scissors
and a painters brush and it is suppose a
little plate so I just taped off the
areas that I did not want the paint to
be on make sure that your area is
completely covered like with a towel I
just use an old towel because this the
paint is not washable and so be careful
with that so then you can just get on
with your painting
my clipboard only needed one coat but
that's just depending on my paint now
you are ready to take your chalk and
just design your board however you want
it to be next up is your peppermint
sugar scrub this stuff smells heavenly
so you're going to take your plain at
white sugar and you're going to pour
that into the container you will be
using this and this is just to measure
out how much sugar you will be needing
and then pour that into a larger mixing
bowl
I took some coconut oil and I put that
into a microwavable safe Bowl and then
you're going to zap that into the
microwave for about a minute and there's
no exact measurements for this so just
don't worry about it pour that into your
sugar and mix it up until you get about
the same consistency that you see
so after doing that take your peppermint
and add as much or as as little as you
want and then divide your mixture up
into two separate bowls take your frozen
strawberries and put that into the
microwave you can use I used about 4 to
5 strawberries and then make it so they
get to the consistency of like really
squishy and the dye comes on easily we
use strawberries because when you are
scrubbing this on your hands or face or
whatever it may be that way the the
color does not bleed as if you are you
to use red food coloring or something
like that put that into your bowl or
your container however you want to and
seal that up and we then took some
decorative twine and put on a chalkboard
label
and there you have it
so last but not least is chocolate
pretzel sticks take your pretzel rods
and then some white chocolate chips or
black chocolate chips whatever you want
and I took a cooling rack and then put
that on a cookie sheet that way it
didn't get all messy then I took the
chocolate chips and melted them in the
wanker wave and then stirred it up now
this is the part where you gonna be fun
and creative and do whatever you want so
I just laid down my pretzel rods
raagh excuse me rods all the next to
each other and then I poured on the
chocolate and I just drizzled it and
added some sprinkles and I was just
really doing whatever I wanted to do
with them we can build a snowman then
and don't be afraid to try them because
they taste amazing and also where to go
