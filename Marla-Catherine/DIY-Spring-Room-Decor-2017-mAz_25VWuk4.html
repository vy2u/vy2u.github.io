new video and you guys are probably like
shook because its title because y'all
another room video you're probably like
Marla do you ever just settle with what
you have no I don't sorry
so I am bringing my best sides and so I
thought why not just redo everything
again so I guess a lot of old stuff but
I also have you been I just read in my
room and these are the cutest DIYs I
have ever done in this oq in the super
intensive and the perfect for spring so
let's just get into the video
so this first DIY is the Donal Bay
collage or in otherwise noted zone
friends and it is just so cute and it's
super funny to it so you guys can figure
out any boy that you're obsessed with or
you guys can just do tumblr photos but
I'm going to be choosing it Dillon Brian
you're gonna need some scissors and some
tape and they just make how the person
however you want I'm just doing an
outline and that's it it's literally the
easy DIY ever and also if you download
it your pics to Costco and then you
could come up it literally cost 3 bucks
to get like 15 of them so I would choose
to go through dot rocks it's so much
cheaper and then I'm just using paint
face masking tape and putting them on
the back and then play them in a quash
and to fill the empty space I just put
some like fake leaf garlands that I got
from the dollar store and I just got two
of them and put them side-by-side so
this next one is my inspiration wall and
it's just full of inspirational photos
and things that I've made that I like
and a little notes that people have
written to me one you're going to need
some twine and some scissors and then
that cut the twine to your length I
decided to do three rows so that's
thought it looked cute and I made my
messy and then you're going to need some
clothes pin and then you literally spin
it the photos or whatever you did on it
to it D whoa it turned out so cute and
this also replaces a headboard so if you
don't have a bed frame like a actual bed
frame this works perfectly so this last
one is called the flower garden and what
you're going to need is lots and lots
and lots of flowers and I got mine from
the dollar store and also from Joanne's
we also need some tape and some scissors
so they can end okay so I just cut them
individually and make sure you leave the
stems that way you can tape them onto
the wall and then I just taped of mine
to the wall and I think having the tape
show is so cute and it just adds to the
look and I put some of mine upside down
as some of them facing upwards
I believe I used different color plans
and I made sure all the plants were
somehow like coordinated that way it
done was too crazy
and I just didn't even put them in a
specific order and it turned out
literally so cute this is probably my
favorite DIY it fills the LA space so
easily and it looks just so tumblr
and the best part is it cost like under
10 bucks to do all this thanks guys for
watching I hope you enjoy it and really
really really really really hope you
guys at least recreate wedding I think I
can't choose a favorite cause I think
they all mesh so well together and they
all look so cute but if you guys do
recreate what I want to see them so just
tweet me Instagram these damn means do
whatever you want so yeah comment down
below your favorite one I love you guys
and I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
