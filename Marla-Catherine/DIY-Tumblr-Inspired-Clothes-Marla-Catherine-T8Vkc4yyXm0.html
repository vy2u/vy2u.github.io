gonna be doing a DIY school clothing
video it's like school clothes i did one
of these videos back to someone you guys
really love that video so i decided to
show you guys a few more DIYs that I
thought were super cute it turned out
well so you should recreate them I also
collaborated with Google Chromebooks to
bring you guys this video so I like to
say if you'd shut up to them at for
doing that super excite about this video
so let's just get right on into it
so before I start any DIY I like to go
and open up my Chromebook and go online
to find a pictures that will get me
inspired for my DIYs and once I do find
those pictures I like to go and save
them to Google photos and then from
there it's super easy to access them and
I'm able to assure them with really
anyone so I like to share those photos
with my friends and then we can bounce
ideas off of each other for our DIY and
then turns out super cute it also starts
in seconds and it is not slowed down
over time the battery life also lasts at
least 10 hours which is also because you
can be in the middle of the last episode
of stranger things and it will not die
on you which is a great the next thing
about Chromebook is then it is a touch
screen which was mind-blowing to me
because I did not know that until about
a week after I had it but basically
you're able to like zoom in on things
which is also perfect for like Instagram
or anything really any of those more
like finger interactive apps they
literally have apps for everything on
the Google Play Store and my favorite
app is Google Chrome because it gives me
access to find inspiration and get
creative but for the do is that I'm
about to show you guys if you guys want
to learn more about Chrome but make sure
you guys go and check out the link in my
description box I saved the best for the
first cuz this is the best so I'm gonna
show you guys how to make this fin
wolfhard shirt it's basically like how
to your border what you're going to need
is some embroidery floss which is
literally like 50 Cent's adjuvants some
fabric markers a t-shirt and a needle
and specifically an embroidery needle
and one of those embroidery hoops and
the total of this entire incisors it's a
total of this entire DIY was literally
like five bucks like it's not very
expensive so basically I placed down the
first half of my embroidery hoop lay
down the fabric or if you're doing your
t-shirt like put insert inside the
t-shirt and then you put down the other
half of the embroidery who closed it
down make sure it's like drum tied that
way so what that basically means
it's like super tight and bouncy and
then tighten that and then you're going
to take your fabric marker or pencil
whatever you want to use and write out
what you're going to make and what
you're gonna want to embroider so this
is the example I'm showing you I end up
making the fin wolfhard shirt but
basically a thread at your embroidery
floss into your needle it might be a
little harder first but you can do it
and then you just embroider and if you
guys want I'll link down below my
embroidery video that taught me how to
embroider guys know who he is and props
to you he's mine don't try to even take
him this next DIY is super cute and it's
the acid-washed jacket and this was
completely inspired by a navy rose I
can't I don't know how to pronounce her
first name but I saw this DIY and just
in case you guys have not seen her video
I'll have it linked down below what
you're going to need is some bleach a
jean jacket or really any denim that you
want to bleach and then a paintbrush and
make sure you guys are doing this in a
well-ventilated area and you get your
prints permission and all that jazz and
then basically you take your paintbrush
and paint on the bleach of where you
want to get lighter so the first places
that you do with your bleach will
obviously be lighter than like blushed
area you do if that makes sense have fun
be creative with this you want you can
be more creative and like out a few rips
into your jacket like I did this is a
little bit more time-consuming and this
is not necessary I still think it is so
cute I love this jacket and I got it
this jean jacket for eight bucks at the
third store so the total of this DIY was
literally like 10 bucks so this was a
score and I think it's so cute
this last DIY is fabric pocket jeans and
I think this is just so eye-catching
like I just think it's cool but what you
guys need is some fabric some fabric
glue some scissors and some of my jeans
that you are willing to potentially get
why that make sense
but basically it's a little bit harder
than it looks but you're going to take
your fabric that you want you're going
to trace out the pocket and cut it out
and this literally took me forever till
I get it right you're going to want to
make a template and then trace it out
that way it's easier and they look more
even it does not have to be perfect if
you guys do mess up do not worry
like do not fret but basically take your
fabric glue and let it dry for about an
hour or until it's dry and then if you
messed up a little bit that is just
behind me so what I did is I took the
remaining embroidery floss that I had
and I stitched like around the pocket
that way it looks like I made it the way
it looks you know like it looks like it
was kind of messed up on purpose and
this just gives it such a unique cute
homemade look that I think it's adorable
and no one else will have this so I love
this one thank you guys so much for
watching if you did enjoy it you know
where the thumbs-up button is subscribe
I'm sick and so that's why my voice
sounds so nasally and so that's about it
for today's video and I'll see you guys
next time bye
you got a charlie you know it wrapped in
you arms is showing it's easy to
misunderstand
I spent the night for home and I thought
for sure I would hold it I thought for
sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
