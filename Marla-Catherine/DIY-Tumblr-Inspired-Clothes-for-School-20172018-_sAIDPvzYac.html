the AI DIY clothes video and wanting to
do one of these for a really long time
since I do love clothes as you guys
probably already know so I did three
DIYs and I really hope you guys enjoy
them and if you guys recreate them make
sure you tag me in social media all
links to that will be down below and
that's about it so let's just get right
on into this video so this first DIY is
this waffle t-shirt that everyone has
been freaking out over on Instagram and
I'm so after you guys like it but all
you're going to need is a plain t-shirt
iron-on letters and an iron it could not
get more simple than that so you're
going to cut out your letters on your
iron-on letters there should be
directions on to the back of the package
that whatever one you buy so I chose out
to do the word waffles you can choose
anywhere you want to do I would like to
do Eggos because you don't like stranger
things but but then I didn't so yeah I
just follow directions and put it on to
the t-shirt if you guys would recreate
this it's clearly so easy so honestly if
you don't do it no what are you
so this is it looks like on I rolled up
the sleeves and tuck it into my shirt
and it is so cute my favorite DIY you
can recreate the waffles one or you can
put on anywhere you want to the next
year why are these afraid ankle jeans
and that gives basically how you do it
you're going to need a pair of jeans
some scissors and a pair tweezers and
we're going to do is cut off the hem of
the jeans so like we're its own and then
you're going to go in and take your
scissors and it makes them longest
skinny strips so however longer strips
are is how long the fray is going to be
I started off by doing short but I end
up fixing it it's a lot easier when
they're longer so this is the more of a
close shot of what I'm doing so once you
do that you're going to take your
tweezers and then you're going to like
break the hem so basically that you want
to keep your vertical strings in the
horizontal one you want to pull it out
and if that makes them all frayed
there's a more in-depth tutorials on
youtube but this is just a quick version
so I did DIY this pair of jeans a few
days ago so this is what they look like
I know that high-end department stores
sell these but not many other stores do
so they're so unique so cute and the
fact that you guys made them yourself is
also this will be perfect for back to
school because no one else will have
these you'll be so cool so this next and
last DIY is the tie-dye t-shirt and this
is just a classic and you can put you
probably already know how to do this but
you're going to need some acrylic paint
spray bottle rubber bands and a white
t-shirt so what you're going to do is
you're going to take your t-shirt and I
chose to do this full design so you just
grab it in the center and start twisting
but there's other ways you could do it
and then you're going to rubberband that
into place so it stays that the way it
is take your spray bottle which is
filled it up with a little bit of water
and a lot of paint acrylic stain and
then you're going to spray that into
wherever you want to make sure you like
soak your t-shirt because it'll be so
much white if you don't it might look
like it's so come outside but it
probably isn't so they're going to let
your t-shirt dry for five to ten minutes
that way it's not soaking
and then when you open it up you can see
your design it's so cute mind turns out
a lot better than your clutter is going
to but basically once you let that dry
for like five to ten hours you can do
overnight or you can just let it sit
until it feels it dry and firm you're
going to do a saltwater wash which you
basically just take a bowl of a really
warm water and the salt you dip it in
there and let it soak and then you store
it in the wash and then that sets two
colors this one turned out so cute
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed the video if you did
