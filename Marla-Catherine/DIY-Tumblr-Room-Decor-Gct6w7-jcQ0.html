doing it's been a little while like four
days but today's video is going to be a
DIY Urban Outfitters room decor and I'm
so pumped for like all the reviews more
videos surgery you know because I made
my ribs packet like honestly I'm so
excited
room tour coming soon so get pumped but
these are all super easy and cheap in
there you could do all the eyes for
underneath 20 bucks and you probably
already have it most of the supplies
going on house so you know that's a
bonus and without further ado let's get
into this first DIY is the classic winky
eye pillow from Urban Outfitters
I think it's so cute but it's like so
expensive and it's so easy to make what
you're going to need to do is I just
took an old white sheet and then it lay
down your pillow filler I just use a
natural like old pillow and then I
marked it the about the size and then
and then I cut it out but when I cut it
out I need it like the size of the
pillow twice as long is that make sense
we're gonna glue to the sides you can
use fabric glue but I only add a hot
glue and it works just as well and then
you can fold over the sides to make them
look pretty or whatever and honestly if
you guys are like having Underwood
ah if you guys are having a hard time
understanding what I'm saying
then just go search up how to make a no
sew pillow and they'll probably explain
it a ton better but you know so smooth
that out and make sure all the edges the
edges are all nice and make sure that
when you are hot gluing it you do not
get any hot glue and yourself because I
didn't hurt so bad so get some parental
supervision
so you're gonna flip your pillow them
inside out and then or with the right
side out and then stuff your pillow in
there and then I take my I have a
reference photo you can just go into
urban outfitters and screenshot the
picture and take a regular pencil or you
know and just sketch out first and make
sure you do this first because it would
suck if you like start it mess up and
then you're just stuck with it then I
took these tulip fabric markers you can
get them for like five bucks at the
craft store and then I just traced over
the way I already made sketch and I kind
of changed it tweaked it a little and
that's basically it it's so cute and
it's a very good do before like half the
price not even half that's like this is
literally two dollars
this next pillow is probably my favorite
it is so cute and it looks exactly like
the one from Urban Outfitters it's this
pom-pom pillow what you're going to need
is some white pom-poms you can use
colored ones but I like the white look
better I got these from Joanne's for
like two bucks and what you're going to
do is take a dot of hot glue and put
them on the pom-pom and then glue that
onto the outside of the pillow if that
makes sense you can see it and it turned
out a lot better than I thought it would
and make sure you space all the pom-poms
too and that's it this next year why is
my like okay they're all my favorite
they're all so cute but it's this dupe
of the triangle decals that they have
Urban Outfitters and the best part about
this is that you can choose out your own
color so I got this critic Cricut vinyl
paper from Joanne's for 10 dollars and I
then cut it out and you literally just
make your shape you can either trace out
your shape but I end up just hand
cutting them out and then you have these
and you literally peel off the backing
and then put them on the wall they're so
easy and they're paint safe like you can
peel them off and the paint won't come
up and I love this even more than the
Urban Outfitters one because I was able
to choose out my color and so I chose
this pretty rose gold copper also a tip
for when you're putting them down is to
wipe the wall first that way there's no
dust
thank you guys for watching I hope you
enjoyed it remember to it smash them
