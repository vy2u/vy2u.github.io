gonna do
hey guys what's up and welcome back to
Marla Cather today's video is going to
be another because only platform unlike
two platforms on YouTube and Instagram
so it's gonna be an Instagram QA let's
get right on into the video okay first
question is from Jessie dot damn kick I
don't know if I'm pronouncing that right
and she asked favorite youtubers okay so
it's actually a boy and his name's
MattyB I know he sings I think he's good
but like nothing like who Wow like I
mean he's good but the reason was good I
think is really hot so Daniel and Hall
would you rather burn her drown um I'd
actually rather drown cause like just
getting burnt like having like the
curling iron like lightly brush against
your skin like I'm like kill me now
hairstyles bye Gaby and before I tell
you totally guys what she asked go check
out her YouTube channel on her instrum
100k on its jem and that's like a ton
and it her Instagram name is hairstyles
by Gabby and I think it's the same for
YouTube but go check her out because
she's just absolutely amazing also how
do you take such nice pictures inside
and how do you edit them so my sister if
you guys want and watch my last
Instagram Q&amp;amp;A will have a link down to
that in the description box
she actually edits my videos my photos
and I'm lame and I don't do myself with
photos um we always face the window so
right now on the windows coming on until
the light were facing the line that we
have better lighting we she actually
bought something called a reflector and
it will it looks like one of those um
when your car and like you're leaving
the card it's hot and it's summer and
you put up like a reflector this is what
the reflector is open about bowling see
like I have a swirling mean life they
see reflecting life and that was like
only 10 bucks so if you guys aren't
trying to get into photography
get one of those and then she edits I
think with is it Adobe Lightroom oh I
got that right we just kind of play
around with the photos until we like
them and we're trying to have a theme if
you guys have noticed if you scroll
through my Instagram feed it's like
bright yellow green blue
oh there's some black and white over
there like it looks like a you course
road Queen Trinity asked who's your
celebrity ever do you now if you
couldn't if you don't could you start I
don't know what you now is and I my
celebrity crush Dylan O'Brien yeah yeah
she asked if you had 1 million dollars
what would you buy I love you so much oh
I love you so much to probably put half
of it in stocks Wow learn about that in
school no I mean if someone said gives
me 20 bucks I already know what I'm
gonna spend it on someone gives me mil
and I don't know Emma underscore
Schumann asked wha how many fries can
you eat in one minute and so be like
drove around everywhere and Bernie was
only place that was open had fries
though and I'm gonna put a little ice on
it because I can only eat fries with fry
sauce and if you guys don't do not live
in Utah that you probably don't know
what fry sauce is in is just a
combination of was it mayonnaise and
ketchup and it just it tastes so pizza
okay on your mark work I'm gonna count
on America's famine
some firm okay timers off how many was
it some food okay
swallow I probably broke a world record
I mean eight seventeen brats in one
minute Elissa Dave L asked if you could
have any superpower what would it be
all the superpowers oh I don't think
that's legal Sophie oh ma toast no score
Oh Shea house never used the internet
again or never brush your hair again
this is a hard one because I don't know
I probably do never brush your hair
again
and I one's kind of weird but like you
know people have like hippies in
dreadlocks I'll just be one of them
Kimberly with two eyes dr. Alvarez asked
what TV shoot show would you recommend
um lately I've just been trying to keep
up to date with American Idol so this
one I'm not going to say any user names
because so many people are accessing
question and it was um do you have a
boyfriend if so who have you ever been
in a relationship have you ever kissed
someone the answer to all that type of
stuff is no uh Whitney I'm to score and
one to ask what is your favorite type of
food and why and my favorite food is of
all time is a spicy chicken so much so
that sandwiches from chick-fil-a go
chick now underscore a dr i am dr z
weird fact um i showed this in my 50
facts tag well show you guys again like
let go see you guys out so hey guys
what's up and welcome back to my like
happened today's video is going to be
like a double squared mm-hmm you ready
all right this one like makes like an el
viernes or playing like make them go
like that I just girl you can do it
better with this one so a lot of you
guys were asking like what would I do if
I was a Starbucks treat my religion we
already had drinking coffee and so that
is why we I just don't go to Starbucks
Oh
ays eg dfx um if you could go anywhere
and we're all good where would you go
first so many places I'd probably go to
Iceland because it's so pretty there
next question was asked by koa dot
Harmon the person I did the whisper
challenge with and he asks if you could
collab with any of you ever who would it
be
is this even a question MattyB so the
next question was Jesse and he the next
question was asked by Emma Adkins 99 and
she asks can i with my can I lick my
elbow challenge
so next question what that's why 10
people is in the caption of the photo
though he said to ask questions I said
don't ask about the short hair in my
forehead it's a long story
actually not that long ago the story I
just do want to explain it today's you
guys can probably already see you from
there do you see that right there about
the like black spot it's like they're
actually old Grouper hairs so this is
how you guys can see the hairs although
it always um so I anyway back to be
phrase kinda like bother me so I did
what they wanted to tell anyone so I
took a Perry Dell Clippers and chopped
it off so it's in the process growing
back so when you guys see that photos
don't realize okay um but I just like to
say thank you guys so much for all this
Mekons
um and I've been really sappy but no one
cares you the next very frequently asked
question was do I have siblings yes we
have five children and I'm in my family
and this is just one of them
she's the little sister and her name is
bunny cuz she is very cool
what does he know much cool and whoa
really the only thing I think she's
useful for I mean why so she can do this
reflected a little bit north I have to
make my face look flawless

hope you enjoyed the video and for if
your question did not get answered I'm
sorry there is almost 200 comments
that's a lot we don't have that much
time so if you had a question you were
really wondering what the answer was to
that I might have answered it in my
previous Instagram Q&amp;amp;A or in the 50
