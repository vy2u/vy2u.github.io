it's about 6:15 and so we got our lives
weren't so noble after like three years
just kidding it was fun um but um even
asked my sister Evelyn I was caring like
every single thing that I thought was
cool but I ended up with my getting one
thing but this thing is like amazing
so a pers when I saw it it's actually
I'll show you guys it but it's called
the Buddha board a mini I can just read
you what it says it says you paint on
the surface with water and then as your
creation will come to life in bold
design then as the water slowly
evaporates your art will magically
disappear leaving you with a clean slate
and a clear mind ready to create a whole
new masterpiece I just think that is so
cool I was like 13 bucks but I think
that's a pretty good price good price
and it's like an investment because this
will last me long time and I don't know
if you're just well me but I love art I
love doing art everything
I just think art is amazing
hey guys I just got out of the shower
and I blow-dry my hair and this is kind
of the after products it doesn't really
look that much different on film but
though basically it's just more of like
a darker ash no and that's what I
actually wanted because I didn't like
the butter blonde I'm like I love it on
other people but on me I just didn't
like it that much um but thank you guys
