random it's a vlog mixture of things
like I Drive we try to film a lookbook
and we go to Taco Bell so anyway it was
super random but it was lots of fun
finished super weird day today I just
feel like it's been very slow like I got
checked out of school at 9:30 in the
morning because my stomach hurt and then
I just sat and watched TV all day and
then like we got up and started filming
dunno a really weird day anyway so let's
just get one into the view hey guys so
today's videos gonna be like a vlog for
Allah it's gonna be blog so I normally
log my vlog channel but this one's just
more special and so I thought it'd blow
my main one I'm gonna be driving four so
it's technically my second time but it's
my first time with my sister call it my
first time cuz they didn't really drive
much that first time by the way I'm 14
almost 15 kind of we're just have to
park it out of my church so it's not a
big deal anyway so I just thought I'd
bring you guys along and I'm about to
duct-tape my teeth I'm gonna duct-tape
my camera so I'll be right back
first things first buckle in this is
weird I really don't feel comfortable
right now
buckle in and then okay so first things
first I put in d4 I'm not gonna tell you
what to do I'm just gonna do it really
hard no that's not what you do what I do
here oh my gosh your foot has to be on
the brake mile okay now pretend you have
to park in that parking spot right there
oh okay I did
okay stop and reverse until I own a lot
of you guys ask how tall I am I am
five-seven
so I'm pretty I feel like I'm about
average they're getting slightly taller
than most kids in my school like most
girls I really love truthfully I'm super
excited for Taco Bell's collaboration
with forever 21 probably to buy
everything for me
and I Drive like a pro like who even
eats drivers at Courtney as part of to
use to clear skin the matcha milk makeup
that's dropping
okay that was enough of that no never
again stop and get out of my car she
thinks I'm gonna move hey guys so it's
Carla and I'm gonna entertain you guys
well eternal
I just don't even know what this would
have come to like history morning Mumbai
you talk about anymore you can't get
skinny without working out that's like
so hot by now hey guys on my phone so
that's why the quality change so I'm
also doing like behind the scenes so I
get part of my day in the life is I fill
most of the time so today we were
filming a lookbook and these are my
favorite type of videos to film so for
the look I have the hiccups I always
have to choose out my outfit so I'm
doing right now I'm leaning it towards
more of a not what not like 80s I don't
even know every single time I do really
quick I don't even know what I'm going
for I normally choose I normally choose
out the outfits like five minutes before
we actually film it it's I feel like I
just do better that way anyway so so far
I have actually I'm not gonna show you
go and watch my lookbook video so this
is my closet what pack there's my
memories box and then stuff I'm leaning
towards wearing these but they're kind
of big around the way so I don't know
how that's gonna show up on film I don't
know if I want to wear this I feel like
I don't like my looks to be too basic
but then again I want them to be like
recreate able so hopefully I can find
something they're currently leaving for
the book right now and we normally don't
have any exact locations that we want to
go to we just kind of drive around until
we find something and
yeah let's plan some dance my sister
chose the ugliest location possible
though we just finished up the first
outfit which was the splitter in those
jeans you're gonna have to go watch it
to see oh go back to a really cute
location okay so I'm now home and this
is probably going to be the most random
video I've ever filmed so sometimes I
fill in at school and I'll post out on
my vlog Channel but Dad is why I did not
insert it into this video because you
can just go check it out my blow channel
and honestly it's school so I hope you
guys did enjoy this video it was super
random but if you do like these vlogs
