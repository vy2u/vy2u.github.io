my hair up again I just constantly
changing you know I just made a little
bit darker and now that that's out of
the way today's video is going to be a
day in the life of a youtuber I like
watching these so I'm gonna assume you
guys like watching them especially since
you clicked on the video but currently I
why no makeup I'm in my PJs and I'm just
gonna be taking you guys about my day
and what I normally do this is like what
I do normally I'm one of those
jam-packed days so yeah I hope you guys
enjoy this video and also quick shout
out to bareMinerals for sponsoring
today's video I am so thrilled to say
that because first off you guys already
know that I only take sponsorships if I
know I actually love the product I love
bare minerals and I've used their
products before and have loved them but
currently I'm about to get ready for the
day I was gonna saw that was me waking
up
I've eaten breakfast um I have to go
food shopping just run some errands
take some Instagram pictures and yeah so
I thought I would just take you guys
along for the ride and I hope you guys
enjoy it so let's get started okay every
single day I always put my hair in a
scrunchie this is actually Brooklyn and
Bailey scrunchie cuz they sent it to me
it's so cute
kind of like a boy when I do this
basically this is a loose mineral powder
foundation and it's so cool I'll be
using it lately and it's like the
fastest thing ever and it works so well
so there's literally five pure
ingredients in this and that's the
entire thing but this is one of those
products where it's super buildable but
if you want just a light weight I stop
some of the powder into the lid and then
I take my brush and I go in and then I
just smooth out my chin I don't know arm
bones I actually love this stuff it's so
fast it's a non chemical mineral SPF 15
meaning there's like no toxic chemicals
that are gonna be harsh in your face
it's super natural and I'm not concerned
when I put this on like what am I
putting on my face oh there's only five
ingredients you know you're good since
it is a powder I feel like some people
would think it doesn't last but it
definitely does I've been wearing it and
it stayed on my skin lip
flippin amazing my powder is in the
shade neutral ivory original and it's
number one pretty pale but I love it
and then
last thing about this is if you have
acne prone skin you don't have to worry
because this will not cause you to break
out and it will not clog your pores so I
feel like almost because it is a powder
it's a lot more lightweight on your skin
and a quick fun fact bare minerals is
the first company to launch a mineral
foundation meaning like a powder
foundation I just think that's so cool
because it's such a cool invention
because it is so quick and it looks so
good I feel like I've never been so dumb
school but right now I'm just really
done and then I start high school so and
I don't know there's no escape you know
Reggie Lee junior high you just go to
high school I'm excited for summer I'm
excited go swimming I'm excited to tan
kind of like I don't tan that well I get
a stay white that's just like that looks
like my skin I'm not even gonna lie I'm
not gonna stretch the truth for you guys
because this is this will probably be
inside of like my updated everyday
makeup for teens because it's so good
I'm so obsessed okay I'm not even going
to apply concealer because I don't need
it cuz it covered up my pimples pretty
dang well okay I just finished up my
makeup look out clear look look at it
look at this graph I my skin hasn't like
this clear in such a long time I look so
good by the way really quickly I wanted
to also talk about their other product
that they sent me I did not use it today
but it's so good it's their new product
called the complexion rescue it's
basically a lightweight tinted
moisturizer with sheer coverage but it
gives you that like radiant glow um so
it provides a hydrating skin care
benefits instantly but like over time it
helps to also clear up your skin which
is so cool because if you're gonna be
applying makeup anyway why not have it
like help your skin so this is what it
looks like
they're super clean at natural
ingredients inside of this but
especially dry skin this whole will be
awesome okay I'm gonna go get dressed
I'll show you guys my outfit in like one
second by the way my eyes aren't red I
have like kinky eyeshadow on and so
we're good there but my hair is straight
I just brushed it and made sure it
didn't have any kinks in it and then I'm
wearing this a black and white striped
shirt from princess Polly I'm wearing up
my denim jeans from the thrift short I
love you so much the Wranglers they are
so cute and then I have my feel all the
Konkan backpack on and then I have my
Nike Cortez's
I think they're the cutest things ever
and yeah they just kind of complete that
outfit though
there we go okay so I'm currently at
doing the scrambling outpost we just set
this up and you know so this is behind
the scenes everything else is so messy
so it's just Instagram is fake you guys
hi it'll be just a moment hi can I get
two large pink drinks with no ice okay I
don't do this everyday but sometimes we
do go to Starbucks when we are out and
about don't get I see your pink drinks
cuz they drip you so much they literally
give you like half the amount of product
when I'm ready but I say please so
there's your life hack for today
they squeeze a lot Jerry sometimes some
hunk rips those vines where they like
mispronounced the words so this would be
like current weight curve ain't bur
right Crump ray all the men do you want
some crimper I would do these look good
it smells like chocolate okay this is it
supposed to reduce your belly fat is
that bad that's suspicious
it's totally like Amanda and I just
finished eating dinner we got a hot dog
there rock concert I was gonna make
curry chicken for leftovers come on you
don't need it now I think we're gonna go
take a few industry pictures now so is

Jerry what are you Patti Annie and
Evelyn's going crazy it's not Laurel is
crazy now outside because I'm painting I
like to paint during the summer and like
spring wat because it's always good
weather okay so I'm in the car with
Evelyn
I changed my outfit and honestly when we
take photos we don't have any like
specific plan you're just going to go
and then find a key location that's
where we take your photos wherever the
wind takes us
what are you doing okay so I'm now back
in the car we finished up the photo
shoot it's so quick and honestly those
are the best hands photo shoot can you
just get the picture are you done but
there's so much fun you know we might
even better be oh yeah we actually met a
viewer we're taking photos in front of
her house like that's crazy also the
