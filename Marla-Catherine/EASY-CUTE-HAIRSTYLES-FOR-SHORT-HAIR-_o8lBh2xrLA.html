did not plan this hey guys it's Marla
until they're gonna be filming a video
but I chopped my hair so that's why this
hair cells video is a little bit
different because who'ii hairstyles for
shorter or like medium so if you guys
did not know but I cut my hair which was
like an entire week ago you know come on
that's I posted on my vlog channel and
on my Instagram so if you don't follow
those and you're little behind
ok yeah so I do have a vlog channel if
you do not know anyway it started aerial
filming why did I pick this up ok it's
so to start off I have mm what is the
last one shower
that's gross okay so I haven't washed my
hair in like two days so it's pretty
greasy and it's kind of gross it's the
end of the day they need some help so
I'm gonna be using some of my amigo
Amica compete OB cup per cup dry shampoo
so good so I'm just spraying some of
this it's not like because a body spray
this is actually a super old curling
iron it but I always like to start off
hanging up and then I go ahead and I
section off my hair so I just like to go
straight from my ears and then I do end
up divide my hair into about three
sections so now I have my hair take this
and I wrap it around like one and I'll
leave it for like 3 seconds 1 2 3 and
then I wrap it around again and then
I'll let go and then you get that and
then you kind of just tug like so I do
this hairstyle probably the most or my
short hair because it's super fast and
it looks like you actually cried so this
is what I do
I just finished up the last layer so I
know it take my hair out of the rubber
band and then I bring it to the floor
and I couldn't run my fingers through
I don't really ain't necessarily brush
so I just do that and that my hair spray
a little and then I can't cut it just so
that is how I do my everyday like wave
such curls
they're pretty natural looking and
should be easy and that took me like
what 15 minutes which is laziness yeah
okay so I did this hairstyle in one of
my super old hairstyles video but let me
show it to you guys he's probably I
think not seeing the video but this is
how to do like the classic top knot
without looking bald what I normally do
is I go and I take from like the arcs
with my eyebrows and then I go up I make
it so sure it's super loose and not slip
back to my head and my tears to me that
oh okay so then I take my meters and i
clop it down in the center of like where
I want my data's button to start and
then I hold that down and then I wrap
around the hair into a little bun
formation I'm gonna see I mess up -
people always like well sometimes
calling a hair so they're like these
never turn out for me it's like
sometimes they don't Trump for me either
and so once I have the bun to wear
something just get pull off your face
without feeling a big like right there
and kind of shake out my hair right here
I pull out some baby hairs because I
also think this but like I said this
hair so it's definitely one that could
be pulled its pulled off better when it
looks really messy and then I like to
pull it just like a few pieces like
right here so that wraps up this
hairstyle and I think this one is
definitely one of the easiest it's not
even I wouldn't even call it like a top
it's literally is a top knot because
it's not a bun it's just like this is
not looking thing super easy super quick
this one took like two minutes okay so
for this last result this one is more of
a formal looking here so you can
definitely wear it to school like it's
not like that formal you don't have to
have curled hair that like works by
anyway oh by the way conditioners are
like that I always do this like once
every day but just pull it back into a
scrunchie it's cute hey okay so for the
best hairstyle you're going to want to
hide your hair down the middle okay so
you're gonna want to first start off by
just braiding your hair and the two
braids and make sure you're motioning
the Dutch braids like towards the back
of your head not down
now look Volvos okay we're gonna fix
that so now that your curtain to
semi-tight Dutch braids I'm gonna go
ahead I'm gonna pull out some hair
deferring my face now because it'll be
easier to do it he can't get really fast
and then I pull out here near my ear
near the between like the top of my
forehead in my ear like right around
there and then I kind of just like rough
it up on the edges but now you're gonna
go ahead you're gonna pancake your
braids and how you pancake is you
literally just pull on the outside edges
and you just pull out ever so slightly
on the edges of your braid be careful
not hole out your grade like the hairs
of the braid you just want to let the
fan them out you know that like creaking
sounds it's like and it freaks awesome
you guys I'm sorry we just ordered a
microphone so that should be fixed
pretty soon
okay so I now have a great pancake but I
don't know what look like windy like
someone needs to like cast me as their
new master because by my spicy chicken
nuggets oh wait they took those away I'm
so a little bit mad because I used to
really love Bundys but then they took
away spicy chicken nuggets okay so now
that you have your two raids your what
you're gonna want to do is I feel like
this here's all that was easier to do
short hair because there's not as much
to like fight but you basically take
your braids and you're gonna wrap it
around to the other side and pin it
behind the other braid my sister always
makes me because I'll do those like ugly
milkmaid braids but no one would tell me
that they're ugly but this is a cuter
version that actually looks good right
so this one turns up really well and I
think it could turn out well for all of
you guys these guys are super talents
too so I think that wraps up today's
