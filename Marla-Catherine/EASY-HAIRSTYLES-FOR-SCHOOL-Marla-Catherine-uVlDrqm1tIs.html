hair stylist video and my last hair
stylist video almost got a million views
like YouTube wasn't playing around that
day like they were being really nice to
me and they were putting that video in
your recommendations so I'm back and
ready to attack with another one mm-hmm
I am bigger and better this time 2.0
baby no but like really I think these
hairstyles are super cute and so I'm
excited to do these obviously I have not
started the hairstyles video because my
hair looks like this right now but I
showered this morning so my hair is
freshly showered and I'm going to be
using hair extensions because I know a
lot of you guys have longer hair anyway
so I hope you guys enjoy today's video
and if you did it give it a Conda
forever just guys like these type of
videos give it a thumbs up it's a cloudy
day so if the lighting is changing I'm
sorry about that can't really change
that I like to start off my hair curled
so I'm gonna be showing you guys how I
curl my hair and honestly I feel like
the most braided hairstyles turn out
better when your hair has a little bit
more texture so I'm very pumped I'm
gonna be using some foxy break curling
irons and this video is actually
sponsored by Fox eBay so thank you so
much Fox in May make sure you guys go
ahead and check out foxy Bay I'll have a
link to their website down below and a
house of a discount code which will be
on screen basically what makes a foxy
Bay unique is the fact that they have
interchangeable calling on so this is
like one of the smaller sizes and if I
want to change it out I just pop it off
and then I put on a thicker one so like
this one's a lot bigger and I just put
it on I just pop it on and then I
tighten it they said three different
sizes and so there's definitely a wide
variety of curls you can choose from
I've been using these curling wands for
the past couple of like weeks and they
curl stained gray I love the way that
they turn out so I hope you guys enjoy
these products too like I said links in
the description box and now I'm gonna
get into the hairstyles video so these
are the three different sizes of curling
wands they have they have a super thick
one and then a medium sized one and then
a smaller one so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna plug this in there you go and
then we lock in place I'm gonna heat it
up to 400 degrees so I like to either
use this scrunchie or a clip just
whatever I have on hand and then I
section off my hair I like to work from
the back to the front I find it easiest
that way Amanda you need to be quiet and
hold it for like five seconds and then I
just let go and throw off to the back
another tip is to rotate the direction
of the curls so curl some away from your
face so I'm towards your face instead of
wrapping it from under over I'm gonna
over/under if that makes sense you know
just change up the direction of your
curls it also has the digital
temperature control which allows you to
control how hot you want it to get
they're all made out of rose gold
titanium and so it helps to create super
long-lasting curls if you guys use the
co2 foxy Marla you can get a hundred and
fifty dollars off the three-in-one
curling wand and if you guys are more
interested in checking out flux eBay all
that links to everything in the
description box down below okay so I
just finished up my curls and they're
like everyday curls I really like then
we're just kind of like loose Beach
waves
if you guys so much for watching today's
video if you guys liked it give it a
thumbs up should I bring my Haitians I
feel like that would look weird okay
thank you guys for watching today's
video if you guys enjoyed it give it a
thumbs up and subscribe I know this was
a little bit different from my other
hairstyle videos but the reason why I
had my sister do my hair is because you
can't do your hair no it's because so
you can't do these hairstyles on
yourself if you practice or just have
someone else do them on you you know
what you know what if you guys recreate
any of these hairstyles that make sure
you tag me in my social medias and
that's about it so see you guys in my
next video bye sorry I don't move like
that
don't pack you my own school crush
I really wish I knew you back before I
knew too much I got one two three four
how many times can I find it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
