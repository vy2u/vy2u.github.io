gonna be doing a hairstyles video this
video is so requested and so i'm showing
you that three of my favorite go-to
hairstyles especially for school
school you want to look cute we want to
look cute so when you want to try them
these are good hairstyles to go to
they're pretty simple and easy to do and
i think you guys will get a ton of
compliments if you wear these I do have
a family vlogging channel make sure you
guys go subscribe and let's try to get
that log home to ten thousand that would
be amazing
I'll have the link down to that channel
down in the description box so let's
just get right on into this video this
first nurse doll is these at low space
buns and I love these so much and
they're so quick and so easy to do like
it's ridiculous for all these hairstyles
I had my hair already curled and I think
coming to her already curled or having
some texture in it or like having like
not washing here for a week that helps
but you literally just take your hair
and you divide it down the middle and
then you twist them like I'm showing
here and you twist it up and put that
bun formation and then pin it into place
it's so soft and good looking or under
face and I just pulled out some pieces
to frame and I really love this one
this next year so is this one that I
came up with I don't even know how I
came up with her I just did and I wore
to school and so many people
complimented it I think it's super cute
so you're gonna start off with the
section that's more towards the back
part of your head and you're going to
French braid the like the top of it and
then braid it regularly does that make
sense you can kind of just see here and
then you're gonna go ahead and pancake
that I didn't pancake it too much today
but I think it's so cute when people
thank you a ton anyway and then you're
going to ever ban that temporarily so
don't stress about that too much
and they're gonna go and take the
remaining here in the in the front
portion and you're going to braid that
one the same as you did the previous one
and you're also gonna find cake that one
and I kind of like to braid them in a
motion where they're going back because
it helps them later and repeat the same
steps unto the other side of my head and
once again I'm pancaking them so once
this is done you're done doing out
you're gonna take them and you're gonna
lay them on the back of your head and
combine them all together into one big
ponytail loosen it up and just pull some
priestess from the face this the first
time I did it turned out a little bit
better but this you can still get that
just of how to do it I think if this
one's super pretty and it would be proof
you like took some flowers in it this
last one are these like fishtail
pigtails fishtail pick I'm gonna call
them fishtail pigtails and I always
start off by tucking my hair behind my
ears and then I pinned that and then I
rubberband them into place and I think
it would be so cute if you wrap some
hair around the Bubber band but that's a
little too technical for me so I don't
but how you fished all these you divide
your ponytail hair whatever in half and
you're gonna take one piece and you loop
it around it to the other side there's
so many tutorials on youtube about this
and so you can go search those up but I
just fished all that and then I pancake
I and I try to pancake it like a good
amount because I personally like think
it looks so much better and it looks so
much more and scramble and tumblr and
whatever I just think it's so pretty
and I do this one and I did this one to
the other side of my braid and I think
this one turned out really cute I also
pulled out some hair for my face like I
always do and this one's also very
fairly quick like it probably takes
about five minutes to do so if you have
some time in the morning and you can do
it before school that would be perfect
so this fourth hairstyle I filmed on a
different day and I forgot about it and
so I realized I should probably include
it into the video because it's so cute
and you guys asked for all the times but
it's how I do my Dutch braids and this
is literally how I do them I just do a
regular Dutch braid and I bring it down
the back of my head and I curve it I
repeat the same steps to the other side
of my head and I try to keep it up on
the tighter side because that way when I
pancake it it's not like too like crazy
you know kind of look like I just
escaped from jail but yeah so you can
leave it like this if your about that
but I'm not so I'm gonna go ahead and
pancake them and how you pancake them
and you just pull on the outer hairs of
your like strand the key to this
hairstyle is keeping the pancake like
sighs all the same and after I've done
that I pull out a few pieces from my
head and I just think this one is so
cute I did this in my Instagram Q&amp;amp;A and
most of the comments are asking me how I
did this so here we go
thanks guys so much for watching
remember to of Jeremiah vlog channel to
Family Law Channel it's a link down
below I'm basically on every social
media site Corey grant IV and that's
about it so see you guys in my next
