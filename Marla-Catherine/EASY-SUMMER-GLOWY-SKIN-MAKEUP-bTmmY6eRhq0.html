so what is up today's video is going to
be a summer do me it makes tutorial and
it's almost summer kind of not really
but kind of
so without further ado let's get started
so it's into summer I don't want to be
wearing like a ton of makeup because
we're going to Beach or you're going
swimming you know you want to look
pretty but you want to like be cake safe
so i'm going to easy to make sure being
clean and foundation today so in the BB
cream i'm using is the covergirl cg
sneers at BB cream and this is in the
shade light/medium and also sunscreen in
it so screen i've selected normally just
pump out basically like a quarter size
amount and then i add in like half a
pump of the foundation that way i get
coverage but it's not like a salt or
facial foundation how are you doing it
like have a pump of the Too Faced Born
This Way Foundation in the shade ivory
I'm so pale and then to add to the
combination of like foundation so I have
in my hand is in cream I'm going to add
like a few drops of the pixie skin at
treat overnight glow serum and this is
like I just bought it today and I've
already used it like five times and I
know it's an overnight one but you can
mix it in with your foundations to make
any more glowy so I'm just going to use
a few drops of that I just like to make
it all together with the tip of the
Beauty Blender and then I just go and I
apply out search my face so I just like
to focus on the center of my face and
then blend outwards for there because I
saw in a magazine or something but it
supposed to like look a lot more natural
people entering center of your face to
outward and then it seems it's all like
a few spots like peeking through I don't
want this to get the full coverage which
means I didn't it like I said they take
like maybe like 1/4 of a pump and then
just use that as a concealer and then I
just like to blend it out with my finger
very lightly I learned a few blend
things too hard it literally just like
mix it like if you still get no coverage
lend it lightly so basically that's it
for like the face face makeup but now
we're going to move on it to my eyebrows
I always do my face makeup in my
eyebrows so I just be doing the usual
not not an intern bro I actually never
really do an Instagram bro I just like
to do it keep them pretty natural I just
like to define them a little so I'm just
going to take this is a brown eyeliner
and so it's a little Wi-Fi it's a lot
cheaper than like the honest audio ones
and this is pretty good if you're just
one to go for a natural look then I'm
glad you got my eyebrows with just the
end of a thule auto brush and then after
you're not I'm going to apply just a
little bit of gel this is the one I
always use it's the essence make me brow
eyebrow gel mascara and this is like
literally the things acting is the
benefit gimme brow except the difference
is that this is only two dollars so too
much my eyebrows up and a little bit
over and repeat the same thing on the
other eye brows okay so now that my
eyebrows are done I'm going to move on
to blush in highlight and bronzer so
this is Ric that's exciting so I'm gonna
start off with the hoola bronzer and
this is just a good so I draw my bucket
of brushes so I just apply it just a
little bit and then I like to focus it
on the edge of my jaw line because
that's where I struggle it's trying to
act like every time of your makeup
tutorial it's for me like literally
every single time and then I apply it a
little
and then I'm going to apply a little
underneath like the cheekbone to help
define a little bit more not too much
because if I do all too much and I kind
of look like I'm trying too hard which
I'm not I promise
so I have to wait for the rain to kind
of pass because they got super intense
and really loud but not going to want to
blush and I love doing blush I feel like
it adds to the life back into your face
and I recently got this one it's a
little sample one but it's the NARS
orgasm blush and I love the color of
this it's kind of like a na highlighter
but it's like a very duly blush which is
perfect - look this is what it looks
like
super cute it's like so tiny so I'm so
excited to share this next products with
you guys no makeup sent it to me and
I've literally used it every single day
for the past like two weeks it's clearly
been the best maneuver it is they're new
so they have a holographic stick and
that's like not well known all over the
internet but they came out with a new
one and this is called be Mars
holographic stick and basically it's
more of a like a pinky peachy nude
holographic stick and it's so pretty so
it's super natural and super light
buildable and all that good stuff still
isn't going to look like and their
packaging is always so cute to click
that holographic and then you just push
it up you apply it where you put your
highlighter normally so the first time I
applied it so so like confused it's like
what the heck's like how does this even
work but yeah you just rub it on to
where you want upon your highlighter and
then you can go in with your finger and
blend it out it's so natural it looks
like your integral galactic Mars glow
it's so cool so I have an early access
code for you guys they only works today
which is April 25th go get it right now
you guys early access to it it's so
promise you you will not regret it at
all I'll go make sure to go click the
link and go check it out will be in the
description box hashtag not Blanc's just
obsessed this is like what makes it that
summer look it's so effortless and it
has such a natural glow and I love
highlighters and all but I'm not really
into powder highlighter like they make
my pores look bigger and they also I
know sometimes they just look like
so I love that it's a cream so make sure
you guys go check it out
looks like galactic that is so what I'm
going to do is I just leave my Kula
bronzer as my eye shadow because this is
always a good to go to it's also just
like a two-in-one like you can use a
bronzer and onions it for eyeshadow so
that I'm going to do a best Cara and I
have been obsessed with brown mascara
lately I showed it in my March favorites
and it's this is a black brown one so
it's not like completely black I also
think that your mascara apply so much
better when you curl your eyelashes even
if you're naturally curly eyelashes or
just kind of naturally curly just go oh
my gosh it's just a little bit more give
it a little bit more volume okay then
I'm gonna take my mask off so I thought
in the alert their latest magnetic maze
magazine and they're like playing like
all the new trends and I thought one of
them that was super weird but it was
really like really put on no top lash
mascara but you can take a lot on your
bottom lashes and I don't know I feel
like I feel like my corn lashes would
feel heavy okay so the last step of this
Megan's trial I just look at q-tip and
the ticket to go anyway foundations I do
not think foundation lists are in and
then I'm going to apply I am obsessed
with benefits they're taught chil bongs
and like their toxins since I braces I
feel like lipsticks it don't really look
good on me but I love the colors of them
a lot of times so I really have this
orange color the choctaw bomb by benefit
I know I use at home exceeds products
but I literally am just obsessed with
them so this is sixties glow mess I use
this in a lot of money machines but it's
because it works so well and I'm just
gonna stir this all over my face and
this is what makes everything glow I'm
like it already been so scared before
you spray it Holy Cross and chewy so let
that dry and it will still look super
what I literally look what I love it so
it sounds like what you want to do
really glue gluey this is what you want
to be super glowy and dewy and all that
fun stuff okay yeah boys and girls that
