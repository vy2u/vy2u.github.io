today's video is going to be the
Central's you need to bring on a road
trip this video is actually going to be
a collab with lily and her videos are
great and you guys need to go check out
her child
hey it's Lily and on my channel I did a
summer traveling guide where I just
showed lots of different like tips and
life hacks and also an outfit so if you
want to see that video then just click
the link down below go check out her
summer video that she's going to be
doing after this video and remember to
subscribe to her ok let's get right on
into the video my first essential is
just a snack and it honestly does not
need to be healthy it just has to taste
good next up is a blanket because you
just want to be cozy and comfy while
you're traveling
then you're going to want to have a
water bottle and some drink packets cuz
those drink packets make your water ball
taste so much better and there's a hair
you want some sort of reading material
like Teen Vogue or just your favorite
book and has to do with Cameron Dallas
or something
another central is Spotify or just any
music app really but and my favorite
song right now is the Maleficent by once
upon a dream by Lana Del Rey and it's
really nice to just relax and listen to
it's always nice to have one hand a
drawing pad especially if you are
creative and you just like to you get
bored and like to doodle and it's just
fun to play tic-tac-toe especially by
yourself oh well I would suggest
bringing a some sort of trash stick or
some dancing moisturise because I don't
know about you but I just feel like my
lips get chapped at the randomness times
bring a pillow because pillow and
blankets are like PB&amp;amp;J you need you
can't have one and not the other
and it went for your outfit you're going
to want to have something that's really
comfy but not embarrassing to wear in
public because you are going to be
sometimes getting out for a pit stop or
something of the sort and bring some
clothes shades that aren't crooked that
from forever 21
