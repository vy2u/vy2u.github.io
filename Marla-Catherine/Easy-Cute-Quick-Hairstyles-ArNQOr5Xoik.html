Marla Kathryn today's video is going to
be a DIY hairstyles cuz you know every
girl's gotta have a good to do so before
we get into the video I want to tell you
guys about a company that reached out to
me and study some products and the name
of this company is called Amica my first
impression was adorable
look how cute the hacking genius I mean
not only does this stuff work well but
like the packaging if this was a shirt
I'd wear and also it literally smells
like heaven with a spicy strawberry yes
it does
it was a perfume I wear it if this was
this was a boy and this was human I'm in
it now let's get right on into the video
so to start off with our first hairstyle
we are going to be doing a Dutch braid
that is pancaked a lot cozy on us
I like it so wait to start this
hairstyle you're going to put your hair
wherever you guys like to part it and go
up about two inches and then like take
your whole finger I separated and then I
go in about half an inch and then I
separate that hair off to divide your
hair section into three pieces and this
is Dutch so the only difference is you
take the middle strand you're going to
cross it over instead of plunder over
then I'm going to grab about a
normal-sized section of hair and rub it
in make sure not to make it too tight
because when talking pinky pancaking
this a wee little harder to do if it's
too tight
once I get about like about the end of
where my IRL ends and you guys see that
all right there I'm going to stop
incorporating hair from the front part
of my face the one clip scored one face
and then I'm going to just finish off
the braid with just framing out like
usually so you're going to even start
the top or the bottom whichever you guys
like I actually like to start at the
bottom and then you are going to go up
the whole section all your whole braid
and once you get about one two three
four up into your braid do the same
thing on the other side buddy close all
good I can't this opponent this flimsy I
fit dust to dust
so for this next hairstyle it's super
trending right now and to get braids
with braids what you want is that
texture and you want all the fullness
and life and so to do that I'm going to
use my nikka I'm done texture spray
that's so this is what it looks like
okay so now I'm going to spray into my
hair like I believe close to the roots
just literally pick up a section of hair
about yay day
divide it into three and that we're
going to French braid this all the way
down
Oh
now we're going to go and
so for the last hairstyle we are going
to be doing a half up half down so I am
going to you with my eyebrows just come
and make a guideline and then go up or
you can start right at your ears and
just go straight up and then grab a
section of your hair and then come back
a little and I go you twist it I'm kind
of loosely and then let it start to get
that bun form and I'm going to secure
over over at the little one we just made
okay you can go in you can just like
this little and then pull out like a
little disappea can y'all try get that
like ariana grande look here you have
your strap up cute half up half down
it's like hot cold your guess but I know
then your own team in light
