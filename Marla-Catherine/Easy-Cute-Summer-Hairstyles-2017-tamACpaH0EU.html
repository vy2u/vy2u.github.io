to be doing it summer hairstyles that
are helix because now it's to put heat
on her hair in summer and today I'm
going to show you at three of them
because I couldn't caucus anymore
I'd like to just say a big thank you to
everyone that has hit the subscribe
button because we've hadded 100,000
people hit that subscribe button and
that blows my mind and so excited it for
future hold and I am going to be doing a
giveaway to stay tuned it for that so
make sure you guys just subscribe right
now that way you're already entered to
the teacher giveaway and that's it
so let's just get into it so this first
hairstyle is just really cute milkmaid
braids and they're going to start off by
doing a Dutch braid if you don't know
how to do a Dutch braid just go search
it up honestly I'm not very good at
explaining it pancake it now because
it'll be a lot easier to do it now than
later and at pimpy 'king is just pulling
on the ends of the strength of the braid
to make it look thicker and then I just
testing it to see what is going to look
like when I pinned it so once you do
that just repeat the same steps onto the
other side so now that you have your two
braids I'm going to go and put them so
put your finger down on to the braid and
then twist it up that way the braid
behind it like stays flat that make
sense and you can kind of just see what
I'm doing and then once you do that just
a bobby pin it into place and that's
literally it so I really like this
hairstyle and it's you can dress it up
you can dress it down you can wear it to
the farmers market or be so cute I
really like how this one turned out in a
super quick and super easy
so this next hairstyle your is like a
really cute half like all of your hair
pull to one side of the fishtail you're
going to start off by doing a deep part
on wherever you want your braid to lay
and once you do that since I do our
bangs I have pinned my hair back that
way it stays secure and then you're
going to start doing a regular braid and
just a three strand of Dutch braid and
then it slowly is going to turn into a
fishtail braid which will be super cool
so I'm just braiding and now once you
like have added all the strands of hair
into your braid I'm going to be
unfolding the three pieces and then
you're going to divide into half you can
see what I'm doing it's kind of hard to
explain but you just split it into two
and then you start fishing
so cute and it's literally such a cool
hairstyle not that hard it does take a
little bit more time so if you have more
time and you want to look fancier then
it just do not and then I'm pancaking it
a ton because that's how I like mine and
then I go and loosen up the other side
that way they're pretty equal and then I
pull out a few of pieces just to frame
up my face and then that completes this
hairstyle it is probably my most
intricate and a favorite one out of all
of them and it's super cute this last
one is so basic but you guys always ask
how you my buns and so this is what I do
I just first put it onto a high ponytail
and I pull out pieces before I put it in
the phone shell
so once I put my hair into a high
ponytail
I backcomb it just a little bit and then
I twist it into the bun formation and
then I just literally mess it up I pull
out a few pieces this is I probably
shouldn't even put this hairstyle in the
video cause it's so basic but you guys
always ask so here it is the social faux
pas
thank you guys for watching we'll give
it a thumbs up and I will hope you
enjoyed it too and have a great summer
and calm down below when you guys get
school cuz I'd love to know that's what
it's all see you in my next video bye
probably just think no ilex like Oakland
Sam's life isn't here didn't I mention
my you think my hair's basic meat okay
do the simplest for everyone Oh
everything I do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
