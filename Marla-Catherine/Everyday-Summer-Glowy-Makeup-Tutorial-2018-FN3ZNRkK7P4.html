well I feel like I'm yelling at the
camera again okay so today hi I'm Marla
if you're new here what is up everyone
how is your day been No hey everyone it
is Marla and I am Marla hence the
channel name okay um my name is Marla
and today we're gonna be filming where
why do I say that I'm going to be
filming a updated every day summer
makeup routine and I love these videos
and I normally don't talk in them but
today I'm gonna be talking through it so
it's gonna get pretty exciting if you
ask me grab a juice box sit down I grab
some flags and let's do this
it is a summer makeup between so you do
have to have sunscreen because you do
not want to die you do not want to
become a raisin in the sun by the time
you're 20 i'm gonna be using the renewed
hope in a jar SPF 30 boys riser this
stuff is so good I only use it in the
morning a little goes a really long way
so I just dip my finger in and I use
that for my entire face I also put it
down onto my neck because you can't
forget about your neck I'm just ready
for summer I'm so excited that it is
finally now and I'm gonna high school
mixture and I'm a little nervy I don't
know I just don't know how I feel about
high school so moisturizer makes your
skin look so shiny we're going for that
dewy look definitely hit this up I
normally wear concealer all year round
and sometimes I don't even wear
concealer at all during the summer but
if I do I'm going to be using this one
right here it's the milk makeup flex
concealer and I have two shades because
I'm in between so I have fair and I have
light/medium and I can mix these
together to get the perfect shade I just
put onto the back of my hand and then
mix them it's like chemistry so I just
put that basically all over my face
because I have pimples everywhere I feel
like the camera does not pick up skin
very well I feel like it smooths it over
I don't sometimes my skin looks really
gonna Karen and it is not a game I like
so I'm okay so this summer I am going to
California I'm actually going to VidCon
this year I'm not invited as a guest or
anything but it's going so I'll be
walking around on Friday and Saturday so
if you guys see me definitely say hi I'm
just so excited I this will be my first
VidCon going and I've always watched the
vlogs and they always look like so much
fun that's exciting stuff sort of this
background is so boring I have
anywhere else to fill my there used to
be the ups right there but literally it
was down to like the U and the e and I
was like you know what it's time to go
so it's going now and I couldn't feel
sad you know you guys don't know if you
guys are a new viewer I used to have the
word subscribe right there and over time
the letters would fall off so it said
like up scribe and then it said ups and
then it went down to like we're gonna
know where the letters went to I'm also
going to Disneyland this year for the
second time and the second time yeah my
heart for the second time I literally
love Disneyland so much I went there
with my family back in was October this
it's a small world ride and I don't know
I thought that it's really weird thing
the next step is blush I've been using
blush lately and I've been obsessed I'm
using the glossy Claud pain I would
highly recommend this stuff it's works
so well in a little goes an extremely
long way like that might be too much but
I just put on the back of my hand
and then I take two of my fingers and I
dip it in there and I put my cheeks are
you to be having a couple meetups this
summer so make sure you guys are
following me on instrum sets we're gonna
be announcing everything and not seeing
the day in the location and all that fun
stuff so my tears are following me on
there I'm Marla Katherine self promo Moe
probably I thought this a weird word
promo and I just make sure I was
watching was it Wayne Goss the one that
likes it's to blend for three minutes
anyway he says to blend for like ever
and it makes it melts into your skin it
makes you look so much more natural so I
blend for a while if I have been out in
the Sun a lot and I'm tan then I
normally don't put on bronzer during the
summer but today it's the beginning of
summer I'm still white so I'm gonna go
ahead and play a little bit of bronzer
this is just the hoola one I use it all
the time in I sweep it underneath my jaw
and then I like to sweep it up I'm not
really big on contouring I suck at it
and I just feel like it makes your
makeup not look as natural especially if
you're not good at it like me so I just
like to go ahead and bronze
I feel so unprofessional because I'm not
very good at this this is just what
works for my face you know have you seen
those like celebrity photos and they
have a super bad flashback or something
or I don't know like nothing something
don't turn out well those poor anchor
bars probably get fired and they never
land a job again because
you know okay one my base my pieces when
people put bronzer in their forehead and
they don't blend into their hairline
like you can obviously tell this is
white and then awesome this is all tan
you're like that's a little suspicious
then now that that's done I normally use
the six dollar like airbrush powder but
I got the miniature version of the
makeup forever like it's good but it's
not anything special so I'm just putting
a little bit of this on to my t-zone I
just like to powder just a little
underneath my eyes and in my t-zone just
loksat haha okay my sister just asked me
if I had a boyfriend that made music the
music sucked would I tell him or would I
just say honey you're so good if you
guys don't know I love music so much
like I'm always listened to music I love
music I feel like I would tell him but I
would do it in a way we're like well if
he's super proud of what he does I'm
just gonna say you know keep on going
and then maybe like every now and then
I'll be like you know okay now I'm done
like puttering and blending out and make
sure everything's good I'm gonna go
ahead and move into eyebrows lately like
for literally the past couple of months
I feel like I've just been doing this
super well for me I just brushed my
eyebrows like so and then get this I
only put on brow gel this is the boy
brow by glossier in this if I can only
have one major product it would be this
right here it's so good it works so well
and I don't think I'll ever use anything
else so I have it in the shade brown
that's not very interesting so I just go
ahead and I wipe off the excess on to
the the what do you call this the later
whatever and I start off around the
middle of my eyebrow and then I brush
that out and then I work my way towards
the I don't know cuz I feel like this
it's still your eyebrow hair but just
makes it look so much thicker and so
much more excited that is that proper
grammar so much more good anyway so I
just do that and I've been doing this
for the past couple of months I feel
like and I've not had a problem with
this and I love it a lot and I even like
to brush my amber hairs down just to
coat them all evenly with product and
then brush them back up again okay does
anyone know if they're actually bringing
back fine do you think they'll actually
probably not millions of you think I
literally I feel like there's no more
actual vines to watch I've watched every
single vine compilations we're running
out of minds we need to make more but we
can't cuz there's no right now
co-founder halts development of its
replacement vine - there will be no vine
- this is May 4th why mine Tizen
postponed for an indefinite amount of
time a project for an indefinite amount
of time there are some reasons what are
they talking about I don't know what I
did without this before ok it's the
glossy a lid star and it's in the color
cub young cub and it's like this really
pretty rose gold called rose gold color
and I'm not the applicators my favorite
thing but honestly it's not that big of
a deal because I just go in with my
fingers afterwards and then I blend it
out with my fingers and it's just a
super pretty shimmery gold color by the
way this video is not sponsored by
glossier or just really all this product
you can definitely layer these with star
things so if you want a more intense
color just go ahead and add another
layer i wern't to school most every day
and so my friend what are you wearing
right what are you wearing on your
eyelids like it looks super pretty
maybe like a hole let me tell you anyway
now I'm gonna go ahead and curl my
eyelashes like I said my answers are
naturally straight and they're so
annoying and I find best I'm using this
just shadow eyelash curler it's one I've
always used while my eyes are watering
well my eyes are watering I go ahead and
I apply some chapstick or lip balm and
this is the glossy a once again well
just might as well call full face of
glass a glossy a birthday bomb calm I
bought this for my birthday and it
smells so good it's ridiculous I just
put that on because I do them pretty
chapped lips little chapped lips and
then use the better than flipping porn
stuff you don't say that I just put this
on my top lashes and I just put on like
one coat and then get this I go in with
an old forgotten it's called I go with
an old eyebrow spoolie and I blend it
out whoopsies okay so and then for my
bottom lashes I've been using the
Brooklyn and Bailey lash next door so
this is sponsored they just sent it to
me like almost two weeks ago or
something I've been using and I really
love it um I wish it was waterproof but
it's not coz my I only used waterproof
for my upper lashes but for my bottom
lashes it's works really well and it
doesn't flake and that's who I love it I
also love the wand it's like super
skinny so it's good for your bottom
lashes
Brooklyn and Bailey if you want to come
out with a waterproof one
and that guys guess what this videos or
I finish and then you shake this like a
Polaroid picture you guys then that you
