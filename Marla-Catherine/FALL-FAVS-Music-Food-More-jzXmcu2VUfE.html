if I'm gonna get fall favorites today
because you guys requested and I love
filming them I like showing buddies what
my current faves are I'm just gonna tie
all those fall favorites even though
none of the products really have to do
anything with haul it's just what I've
been happening to be loving during this
fall season let's just get right on into
this video if you cannot read what that
says it says I'd rather speak Hebrew in
the 1940s then when she bowls with no
Capri Sun which was said by Tony Hawk
Tony Hawk the skateboarder okay I'm
gonna start off with this right now so
if you guys do not know I didn't get my
braces off and I do have a video on that
so go check that out
I've been trying to wipe my teeth daily
I haven't been very good at doing it
lately but this is the toothpaste I've
been using its the crest 3d write
brilliance plus advanced protection I do
like this I've been here for about a
week now and I do feel like it helps
just maintain a white smile and next is
this toner of my makeup and this is the
probably have heard of this because it's
so hyped up and I think the hybrid is
true because it's the cooling water and
this makes my puffy eyes they're so
swollen in the morning
this helps that and so this is awesome
and I just put this on like underneath
my eyes on my cheeks and yeah so this
next product is the German the next part
of is this Dermalogica
clear start and this is just a all-over
toner so I spray is in the morning and
then at night it makes my skin it feels
super refreshed and I feel like it wears
like cleans my pores so you just feel
super good and hydrating though this is
awesome I'm loving this it's a really
good not do but like it's a really good
product just like the Mario Badescu the
next one is for my hair and this is a
Sebastian trillion professional this is
basically a heat protectant I do use
heat on my hair a quite a bit I probably
just some kid on there like three times
a week though I and I've always been so
about it using heat protectant which is
not good for your hair at all so I've
been using this one and I love the way
they smells and I feel like it's kept my
hair like my hair didn't feel a little
crispy afterwards okay so the next
product is
another scheme here project and I don't
know if you guys even like I like
watching these videos personally but I
don't know if you guys I don't know I
feel like sometimes you can be so boring
because I'm just talking about product
you guys asterisk video all the time so
I'm sorry if I'm not very like
entertaining this is the glam glow a
gravity mod and it's the one that's like
the firming treatment
I like the anti age I know I'm like
literally 14th I think it's good to
always start using anti age products
like when you're younger before you even
have wrinkles because then it like just
firms up your skin it's really cute and
it worked and it smells like pina colada
okay so the next product is I've always
used these and I feel like when I do use
them my hair grows a little bit faster
and the hairs gonna know that gummies
I like the gummies better than the post
because I'm better about taking these
than taking like three big pills but
they're by nature's bounty and the
basically are for your hair your skin
your nose and I feel like my hair grows
faster when I take these they taste good
and they're just a nice I feel like I
look for thunks they taste like fruit
snacks so the next product is also
another hair product and this I feel
like I have a few more high-end parts in
here like the glam glow that her he
projected and then these now I bleached
my hair like three times and it's not
because I wanted to necessarily but I
had to you because my hair was like a
girl's color or I don't know if you guys
are following my channel you knew that I
dyed my hair blue and then it stained it
and then I read bleach it again and then
anyway long story so basically my hair
is pretty damaged but I feel like it
does pretty well I get my hairs a lot
stronger than I thought it would be but
it always use a little bit help so I've
been using the caviar repair I've only
used it once but one time it worked so
well but it's like literally thirty
dollars and this is annoying the whole
size literally works so well I don't
even understand how how I can do it even
after one time I definitely would
recommend this if you have a bleached
hair or you just want to give your hair
a reboost though ask your hair stylist
to go purchase this for you or they can
just pin it back because it my only my
sister's a cosmetologist were able to
like go to those licensed only stores
but if you know someone it then
definitely go pick this up so the next
one is a makeup product favorite links
and it's the Bahama Mama
bronzer look this is literally ten bucks
and
works so well it's ridiculous how
pigmented this is and how it's like the
perfect shade of like that warm bronzer
but not like orange oh it's a it's
awesome this breast white people out
there and struggle I wish I was tan so
talking about being tan I've been using
I've only use this one so far but it's
the st. Tropez self-tanner classic so
this is like 40 bucks
and I think the price totally worth it
because it works so well and I did
bronze and I like went to school the
next day it's only cool or clunky on it
they're like oh my goodness where they
look so tan and they're asking me what I
used because it look they're like did
you like get a sprig chance it looks
really professional but I was just
telling them that it's this so I
probably gonna start using this more
often and it just looks really natural
so this okay so the next thing are these
these are not healthy but they're
delicious
it's the pretzel crisps and they're
white chocolate and peppermint I love Li
so much that I look forward to the
holidays because these are a loaded like
limited edition
these taste so good like only imagine
what holiday tastes like this this is
what they taste like okay so I'm gonna
share with you guys to my like her
favorite songs and you guys wanna hear
some more of them you can go follow my
Spotify playlist underscore Molly
Catherine or you can check out let's
know my older music for this videos but
I just want to give you like two of my
favorite ones right now so the first one
is useless by my young I don't even know
what they're saying
I've already known about the song for a
while but I you know when you like
rediscover songs
it's anyway so I rediscovered one of my
old favorites
and it's I don't know what to say anyway
that one is super cool like techno like
it's just it's just a really good song
to listen to when you just more like
pump it up in the car I feel like this
was a more random favorite to do because
I didn't really have any categories it
was just running but you like random
most of them for beauty products but
anyway so I hope you guys enjoyed this
