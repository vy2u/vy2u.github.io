hello everyone its Marla and for today's
video I'm so excited I'm going to be
trying British candy I'm so excited
though
I didn't really look it up because I
want to be kind of like surprise myself
but the ones I did see there lived very
exotic and exciting in British and so
let's get into the video so I'm just
gonna kind of like stick my hand it to
the bag of goodies and you don't see
what comes out so this is the millions
the tiny tasty chewy sweet bubblegum
flavor
honestly they look like little like
beets that you would put on a necklace
that color looks very artificial how
much is that in Euros and make sure you
guys comment down below if you're even
from England and if you're not comment
from which country you are from okay so
they're literally beets like I don't I
don't know what like they're like
rolling around on my hand but oh yeah
these taste rude I think it's weird it's
like it's really sticky though I can
expect my braces that's not okay that's
happens when you eat gum British so I'm
gonna stick one here in the bag seal
comes on next oh this is the blackjack
NEC that sounds like weed
any tea is black licorice so this is
like black licorice flavor choose and
okay and just let you know if you don't
like licorice licorice licorice that's
gonna come the next word you guys don't
like black licorice is already right oh
you probably not gonna like this it
looks like a black starburst so if
you're gothic and email this is the way
to go it tastes like sweet in black
licorice like in the form of a hard
starboard um so the next thing that just
pulled out is called jelly babies and
they're the mini version hey that smells
weird
don't looks like a little mini boo bag
abouna is anything that tastes good it's
like a weird texture it's like you chew
it and you're expecting it to like
bounce back bite like gum but it like
dissolves moving on to the next British
item of choice is this it's made by
Cadbury which I know is I don't know I
know they sell Cadbury eggs and like
America and stuff but I've never heard
of this and he's a whisper bar and it's
what the description is
is aerated milk chocolate bar which
sounds extremely good it's like aa
Chompy I love this video I just guys -
any candy I'm first up it boy honestly
looks like a regular like candy bar
nothing too special but whoa it comes
off like like boom not like the eye when
you eat Snickers it's like your teeth
sink in like this just like chops up oh
it's a really thick air yeah that's like
totally aerated on you smacked but it
was extremely good and I would suggest
that what was that call the whip the
whip with a whisk sorry it's not wick
not whip that wins
stay for the next one it is another whip
but it's the walnut walnuts whip huh it
says one whip equals one serving
that's one serving for me what am I
looking at Hawaii
I honestly this looks weird and then I'd
like a little ball not on top and it
looks like I can already tell us a
little bit of marshmallow action going
on in there I don't know a goodbye it is
so weird and then they go along up with
because they just glue on a walnut
I call that clickbait I don't know about
you or the next candy is is called this
your Keith and I saw this one and I was
like you know it's described as raised
it and biscuit so you know with me it's
dog food no it says man fuel perf and
stuff hold up man okay let's just rip
this baby open it kind of look if you
guys have had a Toblerone it kind of
like has that perforated like you know
like it's kind of like you break it off
okay mmm I want you I don't know where
they're giving the word biscuit from
though okay
so for our next item of business we've
got these these this cherry vit Moe
fizzy I love survivor oh there is make
sure been like this all day
honestly taste like I just drink that
like nasty cup this is disgusting maybe
because IV in like a lot of chalk like
what or something but that tastes like
cough syrup hey before the next one it
is another kind of like whip sing and
it's the called the arrow but it has
like green stuff I think this is kind of
cool like the way they package this one
I'm gonna break down awful that's good I
love mint and chocolate err but honestly
I think it tastes almost like identical
to York and for our final candy this is
called the curly wurly it is gigantic
and I think it's a four crack or
something like that
I'm kidding what ripoff I bought a
package of ten if I can
Oh what the crap but this is like paper
people and it's a chain link you want to
taste like a milk done this is so weird
that is it for today's video and thank
you guys for tuning in and for say to
that this was a Jenna fun and overall I
would say British candy it's pretty good
and there's a few odd things like that
walnut with like what was that I look
guys so much and I'll see you next
