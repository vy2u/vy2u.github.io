to be talking about three things
free and fun or if it's not great
extremely cheap uh basically free thanks
to do it during the summer when you're
bored or if you just want to do these
with your friends or you just want to do
the my shell I'm excited to share this
with you guys it's kind of like a summer
Survival Guide and not really so I'm
just going to get into it since we do
watch awesome
so my first line is having a sleepover
or sleeping on a trampoline this sounds
like so much fun I've never done this
before but I do have a trampoline so I
probably should but it hasn't gone warm
enough yet because it's not that too
much going to just sleep underneath the
stars and you can like do it with all
your friends then it the next idea is to
if you don't have a trampoline or if you
just don't want to if then you can set
up a tent in your backyard and sleep and
Dodson's likes well camping but give it
it like the luxuries of having your
house right there
and if you don't have a backyard don't
fret because you can just honestly sleep
in your sub a tent in your basement or
in your living room and that would be
fun to the next idea is to roast
marshmallows over like a stove or a
campfire
I personally don't I don't have a
campfire but we were kind of planning on
building one so just rocking it over the
stove would be so much fun and that's a
lot of these activities are things you
can use your friends and family so
that'd be super fun or by yourself which
is just one of the night snacks it
actually is making slime and this is not
free but most of the time some you guys
probably have the items around your
house it's just glue contact lens
solution waking soda and food coloring
the next one is and not free but it's
just a fun activity to go through
shopping there shopping is my favorite
thing to do ever just go with all your
friends it's loaded some headphones and
gold go hand go through shopping like
that sounds like so much fun it's there
shopping is also breaks and super cheap
like everything's very cheap the next
idea to do when you're bored is to work
out an island you're really working out
you can do the hit workouts the HIIT
workouts and they're basically like
intervals like you work out really hard
for like a minute and then you rest for
like a minute it's time so it's a lot to
find if you form like techno music and
all
good stuff with you don't activities in
your town so this might sound weird but
like my town my state you thought we get
like these magazines at least in like
where I live 50 magazines is basically
filled with all these activities are
going on during the summer like prayed
and like facilities you can go to do to
do activities and those are a lot of fun
and my family always does them during
the summer and I love the parades
they're always so much fun so make sure
you guys well and like search up on like
your community website and see what's
going on having a picnic would be such
fun just go and get a pic a blanket go
to your backyard go to a local park go
anywhere you can just go to a picnic
just make some homemade sandwiches have
your friends or family and that would
seat the rocking and it's kerchief
starting a blog or You Tube channel that
is what I did back in the summer of 2015
I was bored and so started YouTube
channel with my sister knife and it's
been so much fun so I totally recommend
that especially if you're going to be
committed that would be so awesome or
just like a fun hobby trying new recipes
would be such fun there's so many blogs
that are just have like the most
delicious like dessert or you can try
like even though there's like bean
brownies like you can't are leave exotic
new recipes to have time and then you
can share it with your friends and show
them how good at your cooking HyperX me
rearranging your room is always a good
way to like mix up things like you don't
have to go buy new decorations you just
rearrange it so even going to Dollar
Tree if you like want to get some like
Rubik or he's like a little leasing
they're a dollar and I got to them and
they're really it's a nice way to expect
with the room rearranging I always just
feels good and then on that side note
decluttering your room I know I didn't
sound like so much fun but I promise if
you like just come honking music and
then you declutter with your closet or
something I don't know I always feel so
like good whenever I clean my yard cell
I love your cellar I have so many like
good memories with yourselves oh just
going over watch shelves whatever there
are you just once you declutter your
room you're probably going to have a ton
of stuff you can either like you have to
donate to like their stores or whatever
or to charity or whatever or you guys
can't sell it if you think it's worth it
because then you could just have a big
yard tool and you can do it with your
like family or you guys could just start
a Instagram account or a Twitter account
or Facebook account whatever just start
a is rampant
two microphones work for us and then you
can just sell your old stuff on there
for like five bucks you could ship it
out and that one's also super fun to be
able to like meet new people make money
making a summer bucket list so like
getting a big like poster board from the
dollar store and then write down all of
the things that you want to do during
summer it's also a really good way if
you like it's also like one it's like a
room decor things because I can get up
on your wall make it super cute and also
like remind you of all the things we
want to do about summer and by making
new a Netflix series or Hulu series if
you guys have any good ones comment down
below because I kind of watched all of
mine like there are stranger things The
Pink Panther cartoons gum balls
fantastic weren't or Pink Panther is my
all-time favorite so if you have too
many good ones
comment down below I'd love to hear them
and then if you guys don't want to
workout inside and you want to get out
and get outdoors a really good way to
going running bring is awesome but if
you don't want to like run around in
your hood because you don't people to
see you working out then it you can let
go to your high school like a local high
school because they always like have
most sometimes they're like football
fields and then there's like a track
around it so that's what my mom and I
used to do we go and run around the
truck and this one is not free unless
you already own it but like having a
movie projector and they can project
onto your garage or like a blank wall
and that would be so much fun to take a
DIY movie theater I know that feels like
iPhone productions I want to get one of
those clova and the next one is doing a
photo shoot with your friends this is so
much fun because do this go you laugh a
lot and you go take some cool pictures
for your Instagram you shove you don't
even have to have a nice camera can see
with your phone so that wraps up this
video is a little bit different than my
other ones and I don't know comment down
below any things that you like to do in
the summer that I didn't mention it and
that way other people could see them and
if you guys like this video give it a
thumbs up and if you didn't just let me
know just just PM me and saying here
that video and I won't do one of these
again remember to knit that subscribe
button if you guys want to and that
would be great and I will see you in my
next video goodbye subscribe remember if
you also hit that subscribe button
because I don't know why you should just
sit go go probably just write it weird
if you're not doing it
okay go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
