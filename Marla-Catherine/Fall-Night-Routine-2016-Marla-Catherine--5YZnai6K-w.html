video we are going to be doing a fall
edition at night routine and I love
night routines I think they're so fun to
watch and also so fun to film and not
only that but this is a club with Lily
Ann on here on YouTube her videos are
amazing they're so good the quality is
just like unbelievable and her music

without further ado let's get into a
video my day normally ends off with me
logging off of online school and I've
been getting a few questions about like

guys right now it is awesome and I've
been loving it so much and if you guys
have been considering doing online
school honestly like do it it is awesome
so I just got back from ordering from
Starbucks and we've got to get it while
I just finished ordering what I'm
getting at Starbucks invading the
pumpkin spice latte but with no coffee
and I also got the cotton candy Prop 8
because that's my favorite one of all
them that he's so good just launched a
little so I've ever had a pumpkin spice
with me I have now a real question is I
mean give us a thumbs up if you have
braces too and you hate how food get
stuck in the back but then you have a
snack for later oh yeah what am I saying
or me just to make sure this has no
coffee no coffee house smells like
quality why is it hot I wasn't expecting
people it's a steamer what's this
don't make cold what's up why would they
do a cold fall drink what's all over you
tastes so good ask them to make sure the
last coffee therapy drink morning with
no vision a fairy church so two tested
Marlee Catherine pumpkin spice latte no
coffee
saying about that life ready set go hot
what he's so good I hate it to be orange
no no after I got my pumpkin spice latte
I am formed the world the Instagram and
snapchat world that I tried it for the
first time it was so good and then after
that I made a quick stop at Dollar Tree
and got a few like cute fall candy I'm
not the Freak on Oh
it's also just funny to have candies
laying around the house
so for what our war is very comfy and
casual my outfit is very comfy and I
think it's really cute my cardigan is
from forever 21 and so is my shirt and
my shirt is kind of iconic it's like
sushi and then my jeans are from
Aeropostale and they have a few ribs and
they're just the dark wash and then it's
just the classic converse that i got
mine from JC Penney's and then for those
of you that we're asking my headband is
from forever 21 and they're so cute
their little kitty cat years and now the
day we were filming this happened to be
my dad's birthday and so I blew up a ton
of balloons and after that I like was so
lightheaded then I went and I played
with my little dogies or they're
actually my aunt's dogs but that one's
Bodhi and then the white one is bear and
we're playing tug of war and I was
wearing my mom's pants and they were
falling down so much now after I played
with my dogs I went and I took a bath
and might these are my favorite products

products and also I love their
chopsticks they like make my lunch feel

bath I go and I head on it to watch my
