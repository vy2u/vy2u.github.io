layer of warm fat during the winter it's
gotta go buh-bye
let's go back to when I was a little tot
wait I was a little oh I got fat my mom
just told me I was cute so that's what I
believed
I'm gonna be sharing with you guys some
tips that work for me and I hope they
work for you so tip number one is an
obvious that's to more eat healthier
honestly like you've all you've all
heard this eat yo fruits and veggies and
you will be good to go it's okay next
rigueur everyone's no Idol but don't
make that your main course so step it up
step tip number two is to portion
control so instead of having a home fire
Snickers bar when we have 1/4 of it or
light and instead of having like this 10
the 20 piece chicken nuggets only have a
10 piece even though I look like a burnt
chicken nugget I have a myself know what
I love myself even though I was like a
burnt chicken nugget I startled myself
tip number three is to drink lots and
lots of water you guys should be
drinking it tons of water at least eight
cups a day a really easy tip to drink
water more often often a good tip to
drink water more often is to get really
really cute water bottle because then
you're going to be like you're gonna
want to fill up that cute water bottle
with really nice hydrating h2o and then
you're wondering tip number four is to
exercise and it's not necessarily like
go to the gym or whatever it's just
being active and getting out and playing
in the snow
or you can Australia to go swimming like
there be live in a day and an A
to order so much technology you guys can
go and search you internet so for some
super fun like games and activities to
do with your friends or your little
sister or your older sister your big
brother a little better whatever you
have or if your only child ripped and
there's also youtubers that just do
workout videos I think that's all their
content is and there's also Lexus
Victoria Secret workouts that helps so
much girl and the best thing about all
this is that it's free like oh by the
way my grandma was like Martha hide

rejuvenates that motivation that you get
