doing a cheer get ready with me and last
year when i filmed this video ayah
10,000 subscribers and we now have a
hundred and fifty thousand so thank you
guys so much for subscribing and I just
get so cool like that one year
difference so further ado let's just get
on to it this chair get ready with me
2017 2017 2017 at 2018 oh this is my
makeup and what I do when I go to a
football game and I'm gonna show you
guys with hair right makeup in my cheer
my cheerleading uniform anyway so I'm so
excited you're seizing this back in
football season and it's my favorite
time of the year just so much fun and I
left here you should swatch fun also
last year when I did chair guy raised me
you guys like do not believe that of
them the cheer team like I get I kept on
begging somebody calling so we're like I
think you're lying so today I'm gonna
start off with my primer because I want
makeup at to stay on all day and all
throughout the game so this is the to PT
/ primer and I'm just going to go and
project into my face especially since my
skin is really dry so this helps it
moisturizes guys do you know the last
video that our last year girl raised me
we had just hit 10,000 subscribers on
camera oh we're at 150,000 subscribers
like that is so cool with one year
difference I'm just so proud of you guys
I was also getting a lot of questions
about when I ever Grace's off I will let
you guys know as soon as possible of the
exact date but my orthodontist said it
could possibly be by the end of the year
but you never know because you know
orthodontist a that and then it's like
okay next time Oh next time then you
know so for today I may be using a CC
cream and that's an I'm going to be
using concealer which is pretty full
coverage and my skin isn't not bad I'm
so excited to be on the cheer squad
again I can't decide whether or not I
want to do high school cheerleading the
reason why like actually no I know for
sure I want to do it but tomorrow like a
matter of will I make it on those two
teams like I feel like I'm pretty
because I like cheering but I don't know
how to do any like back tucks or any of
that and I did tumbling for one month
and then I quit
it's like my little sister advanced
before me and now it's just embarrassing
and I'm going to go and try out a new
browser today so I had a little sample
version of this but now there's a big
one I'm going to be using this brand is
the balm cosmetics and they are right
there probably my favorite like makeup
or and all their products I can never
disappoint and I always will go okay so
today using this brush but this is this
is Alessi 514 blush brush I'm a Robles
I'm going to use it for bronzer brush
and kind of the look it's slightly
cooler toned more cooler tones than the
hoola bronzer so I feel like it could be
like good for contouring and bronzing
and I'm going to put okay I just found
my favorite pair of leggings and I just
bought foundation on them so um when I
first I this will be my third year of
cheer which is crazy cuz I feel like I
feel like I haven't been doing it like
that might even I remember like the
first time I joined the cheer it was the
cheer team lose in seventh grade and I
was so afraid that there's new so many
like Mean Girls ended up being like all
like the nicest girls in the school so
honestly like those movies and TV shows
kind of like make it like this image of
like about you mean people like a bunch
of Mean Girls like on the 13 ones in
reality like that's not really true so
if you are considering this drawing the
choose me but you're afraid of like me
people like their arms I can assure you
they're most likely will just be a bunch
of nice people because cheerleaders or
normally likes just be like peppy and
with cheering you on so I cheer team our
colors are maroon and gold so I'm going
to try to like incorporate some of that
today so I'm going to take the Venus
palette and I'm going to be using the
color assume use the colored needs at
all with the cult Vic or you're some
kind of a going to 10th maroon red I'm
just pinching my brush so it kind of is
like mimicking like a fan brush and then
I'm cleaning the product on there and
then applying it on my bottom lash line
so I just smoked out some maroon color
on my bottom lash line and then I'm
going to do some bright yellow sauce
goldish lead eyeliner and I hope it
looks good so for the winged eyeliner
I'm going to be using two of the NYX
products so the first one is the NYX
David bright halo vivid halo I'm Alicia
this is it just like a bold one
I saw the movie Wonder Woman and I was
going to get hate this but I didn't like
it I didn't like the way it ended
like I feel like there was I know it's
like action movie but I feel like
there's just so much like there was a
lot of action so my makeup is finally
done and I feel like it's not that fast
as thermal car to do so it's like it's
kind of hearts they don't want to do red
lipstick I'm gonna mix them I'm going to
do in a few with it today their
generation G lipsticks and also the
color leo and I'm going to mix them
together from a rubble actually I'm
really not but like this looks like my
grant like my grandma's lipstick now
let's do hair so I dig out a shark so
when hair slightly damp it's that should
be fine sisters all I'm going to be
doing another half up because that's my
favorite thing to do for cheer because I
feel like it is all things so I just go
with the bun and I'm just going to go
form the corner of my eyebrows and then
do that so no like that's gross and then
I'm going to go in with my cheer ball
this year a cheer bow is also spray of
gold okay but these are also like me to
your composition bows it even comes like
the right Jones I really like this so I
think this is what my uniform and my bow
and my pawns are all my favorites that
they keep ever had I'm really excited it
and hopefully I don't put this in wrong
and I don't get it which I hate like
last time but I'm just going to like
clean my shot
sorry I like you all why won't these
over and from now on Loki panicking
why are you loving this earth this is it
I can't give remembering about people
that was me being scared okay so for our
day hairstyle just watching likes it on
manipulation where are you gonna put the
bow what is it all floor is there any
look like thinking playing so when all
of solves and everything else has failed
