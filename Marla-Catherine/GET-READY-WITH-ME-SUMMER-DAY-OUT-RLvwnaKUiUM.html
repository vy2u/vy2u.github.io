get ready with me like a summer day a
logician so I am collaborating with
Gillette Venus to bring you guys this
video and I'm super stoked and this
videos awesome and let's just get on
into it I just start off my morning very
relaxed and I just wake up kind of later
in the day around 10:00 then once I get
up I could go and just head on and she's
bathroom first so once I'm in the shower
I first off use a body scrub because my
skin I'm so into dry skin everywhere I
don't know why I'm just super like I'm
like a lizard
I just keep AIDS it's locked container
so the sugar inside of the shower so I
then just wet my skin but on the sugar
and I scrub it in and it takes off all
the dead skin which is awesome so after
I have exfoliated my body I go in I wash
it so I like to use like a mango papaya
body wash but it smells super good and I
really like this one and it makes you
feel queen so that's good and after I've
done that and my body feels like all
clean now I wash my hair with horse
shampoo so I had just ran out of horse
shampoo but there away the bottle before
I filmed this video but I always wanted
here with a core shampoo and I just feel
like that makes my hair so much stronger
and thicker and it grows a little bit
faster I don't really know if there's
been a big difference from using it it
makes my hair feel so much healthier and
so I love you too messed up I also just
like to do what my face wash inside of
the shower tubes and says it's in there
they say go see a milky jelly cleanser
and this one is at my favorite and I
also will sometimes brush my teeth in
the shower that might sound gross so
honestly I just do it because it's just
quick and especially if I'm in a rush so
every toothbrush toothpaste and brush
your kink in there and so once I I'm
like all clean and fresh I like to shape
our shade last I don't know why I just
going to I love you seeing my Gillette
Venus rate just because they make me
feel so much more confident when I'm
wearing shorts and stuff like that
because I don't know wait hairy legs and
just I feel so much better
honestly like having shave legs is make
you feel good just to show how good
these ridges are Gillette Venus is the
most awarded female razor brand which is
awesome
so the exactly two razors and shaving
gel and I got to try out all of them
whether they semi would be a comfort
glide one I think this one was meant to
base my favor out of the two of them
because you don't need shaving gel
mousse research that's so nice because I
don't know how many times like I just
get too lazy to like lather on all the
shaving gel and like just doing all that
and it's so Toronto cuz on beneath and
like above the Apple razors there's some
self lathering moisture bars and it's
awesome because it helps you get a
really close shave and moisturizes your
legs without meaning to you change up
the excecute originally they sent me
with the Gillette Venus swirl so this
was awesome because the plus ball allows
you to get to areas like your knees
which exhibit age example weight I cut
my knees so many times like basic races
and this one I did not cut so that was
awesome and I now don't what he means if
you guys are interested in trying out
these razors and the shaving gel you can
go find them at your local Walgreens so
after going on shower I go and and move
on to hair and makeup scholarships cut
right on into that it's go away to the
metropolis primer this is the hangover 2
base one and it's my favorite one oh I
probably that viciously stabbed myself
experience oh I'm sorry Philip I can cry
now so I feel like priming your face is
important especially during the summer
because can get really hot don't your
makeup melting off your face it's not
good if you're a beauty guru you already
know about this or if you watch any
YouTube video this is us it's the your
skin but better CC cream and this is in
the shade medium so I just do like a
pump and a half I feel like that's
enough for me how many of you guys if
you guys know about you probably know
about Rachel can too but here is know
about her sister and I can to be still
funny I watched her videos today like
watching the entire time but it's like
funny because it's like she doesn't try
to be she is my face makeup is all
blended out now and I'm going to go in
do my eyebrows so that was doing the
face and then my eyebrows and then my
eyes so I'm so proud this is not the
same shape I don't know where my on it
so 0 climate so you know I go and get my
mom and just defined that her is empty
and just really defining the arch that's
why I always do just make them look a
little bit more thick that you think it
could be baby where's your first your
singing
Roland I just felt like it wasn't her
fruit tree - gasps Norville when I did I
was summer drink called this youtuber
and then Ivan I did business like that
so before I sold si I watched a few
interviews of Dylan O'Brien and then I
was ready to go so about the guy who
taught church oh you're doing something
else
I love boys Church like I honestly do
know I could do you know I was just
being a good person uh you show up at
church like 20 minutes early and we live
like right next to church so I was
literally just like chillin like a
villain no like a good Christian girl
but this like entire like family of like
older people like come sit down in the
row above us like in front of us and I'm
just like no okay
and then like I see this beautiful
creature I would so did the entire time
I was staring at the back of his neck
he looks exactly like Dylan O'Brien and
I was so committed with him but anyway
it's a lot of like story time give it a
thumbs up share like and subscribe if
you enjoyed that that was the person
last time I found a little my career
goal um why do I look like I'm at a crab
whenever a smile cured yet so it
embraces smell that so ever is wait
maybe they do have food so today I'm
going to be taking the color rebirth and
I'm going to be putting that all over my
create enemies as a transition color so
decent amount of Park onto my brush and
then I'm going to go and I'm going to
put that into my crease I don't
understand those people that do not make
up what my I don't understand those
people that do their makeup like using
the pallet meter like that's too small
for me so yeah so now I'm taking my
Kerbal washcloths mascara it's they have
to be using black because I didn't grab
my other one wasn't smart open so I'm
now going to go in and do it my hair so
if you like sure you hanger might this
on your heart rate just it makes it less
