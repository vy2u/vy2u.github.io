back i have surprises surprisingly I
have not gotten any questions or like
comments about my teeth but I'm actually
really self-conscious about them and I
have been going to the orthodontist
since I was six and I still have not
gotten braces so we're really over doing
for time and so this upcoming week I am
getting my braces and I just wanted to
show you guys my get ready with me cuz
sometimes I I know myself I'd wonder
about what should I wear like how do I
get my hair or whatever so this is just
what I did to be ready for this really
fun and rad experience of getting braces
so if I'll be along and just kissing
watching you gonna wake up and have
confidence girl cuz you know braces I
would suggest making your bed before you
go to the orthodontist because you don't
want to have to do all your chores
afterwards because you might be sore or
whatever and yeah I have a bunk bed
do not judge judge feet Joan I just a
Joan zone Judge Freeh so for hygiene
you're gonna want to really just brush
your teeth is all I care about right now
because you don't have stinky breath
full yo orthodontists then you can wash
your face this is optional but i really
suggest it now for makeup i would really
suggest making it light and very simple
because when your orthodontist is flying
and pulling your teeth or whatever he
his hands are gonna be touching your
face his or her hands are you touching
your face a lot and you don't want all
this foundation coming up i just like to
stick with the concealer and green stuff
and cover up your dark circles and all
that jazz I just like to bronze it's
really to add color because I'm really
as pale as adword Edward Edward why
can't I speak filmdom brows and curl
them eyelashes unless you were born with
Brooklyn and Bailey eyelashes they're
like curlier than I don't know was curly
fries seriously
and you can dance to make your day
better now for hair you really want to
keep it very simple and you want to
leave it up because when you're laying
down you don't want it to be
uncomfortable and also when the dentist
is putting stuff in your mouth you don't
want to all of a sudden this chunk of
hair just laying in your mouth and I'd
be really weird I just chose to do Dutch
boxer braids and then pancake them a
quiet a bit but you can just do it to
your liking and I promise I was not
about to cry just for some replays and
my eyes were really watery for my outfit
I chose something very comfortable for
me choose whatever you want because
you'd be laying down for about an hour
so bald bit getting the procedure done
and what I chose to wear was all from
forever 21 and it's a white t-shirt that
says scroll comment like repeat for all
my instagramers out there and then I am
wearing this pair of shorts that looks
like a skirt but they're shorts
eat you
now for breakfast eat whatever you want
to eat I'm literally telling you this
now because visit your last chance
before you have your become a metal
mouth
now walk out the door and have
confidence thanks for watching hope you

braces ah so exciting oh and yes stay
