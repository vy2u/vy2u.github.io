now we can just get ready let's go I
mean that literally was you this isn't a
meme of the day because I've cut my
bangs like for Clint and I never learned
someone needs to tell me I don't look go
to things you do look good with things I
don't know no don't say that because
I'll know I every single time I get
bangs I'm like why did I do this I
cannot multitask I do not talk and do
some I cannot multitask but I cannot god
and do something else it's hard enough
for me to talk already but to do
something else walking whatever the
camera turns on I'm like oh
I can literally cut out like three
minutes I mean just be like um so honest
I like to start off by putting on some
just like also we have two years like
literally right outside of the cameras
well I give her like really good looks
like we're like just I think there's
like a billion mirrors and they weren't
gonna care about the Zeta um I'm
starting off with okay I'm shutting off
with just a primer I really want one of
those like you know those green
primaries and like cancel all the red in
your face I really want one of those
with my skin is so naturally red like if
you would see like it looks like I'm
naturally like pale like my display but
I just like look great Avery and I both
went to public no we both went to online
school and then we joined public schools
so how's your public experience um it's
been great I have I'm actually taking
like kind of art classes yeah like I'm
taking like a marketing class it was
like really hard weather there whenever
someone asks me what classes I'm taking
I just like blank
okay give you mind allotted I'm thinking
who do like this yes I do I'm using
color correcting concealer if you're
like wondering why I'm putting green on
my face so I'm just putting on some
concealer right now I like to mix the CC
cream real friends share makeup college
your public school um it's pretty good
like okay I'm not they don't know I'm
useful why is that me that's like no
overall I took all my teachers are
pretty good except for my math teachers
and I if my Master's
my math teacher is watching this I don't
see you're about to get an F now seems
to be rude it's just you I don't think
she enjoys her job you can like you can
always tell like what a teacher just
like yeah like my history teacher you
can tell bugs like history so a really
good teacher I feel like I look so white
now it's cuz this concealers too light
for me but I'm gonna go over this movie
now that I have about
foundation layer of and fix it to me
more I'm gonna use this so little it's
my favorite thing to actually work
though like you think it's better than I
mean it is Beauty Blender like brand
looks like she's like under my eyes I'm
gonna scratch on my hand I know how that
is
do you see that yeah I have no idea oh
yeah that's probably tell me what
honestly she's probably like well I
don't like you I'm so nice to her if you
guys don't know Evie is my dog I have a
mr. Krown a human I know if he is my dog
and she is my best friend and I love her
so much

my brand-new pants and I'm so sorry
I'll try it why are you sorry you didn't
do anything and you're gonna see that
way is that where it is can you guys see
that in that oh I think it's coming out
I think
well these are my brand-new pants okay
what was the question with your song new
offers
okay I've been loving like a billion
songs but I think my favorite right now
it's called single by the neighborhood I
know just know why all summer cases you
know the girl that makes yeah that girl
is dating the lead from this band the
neighborhood isn't that true sivan know
this is all new to me I always like
whenever I have to do my makeup or
something I always like mess it up when
your favorite makeup products I'm like
I'm literally not big on makeup all like
I'm still bad yes I am I like this color
correcting concealer I use this like
every day and it's a good enough story
yeah just l'oreal but like it's really
good coverage my favorite is either this
support collection bronzer like love
that and I also really like I like their
concealer from that out recently more
they grow Gavin if you're watching this
subdued Mesilla how you do it I don't
really okay what TV show character would
you swap the bodies with swap bodies
with I kind of weird I was literally
just thinking that like the only TV show
i watch or maybe like spongebob like
dude so do i do you love it like because
I like kind of have a Loki crush on Finn
well party me too I thought he texted
like my friend this morning guys I just
want to date him apart he's like he's so
cute and he's friends with that one guy
who made like the Jared yeah I didn't
even say he just really was just like we
just knew spurt yeah oh yeah like a spur
growth growth spurt obviously not very
bright
conclusion on this video I'm Finn
wolfhard where you at we're waiting do I
put everyone to watch I think I plan on
going to college
I don't know I mean I've never like I've
thought about it but like I don't know
where I want to go or like what I want
to major in like I'm sure I will go but
like I don't know I just I know I'm not
planning on graduating early you are
like yeah I want to graduate next year
so then I'd be like yeah I'll be like
just barely turned 17 so then I'll be
like everyone I always tell everyone
that I like then like what do you want
to do like I don't know I'm just ready
to like you have to my channel
sometimes like come to Disneyland right
now I'm here oh I'm here the country
flight what's your favorite fall trend I
really like wearing I don't know are
overalls a fall trend okay how many
times have you got your hair in what
colors doesn't die me darker like
highlight meets lighter I've highlighted
my hair well yeah just like in general
this is like my natural color and like
my eyebrows alright natural color about
the night dress my hair's dog I'm
actually like not done my hair anymore I
got my eyebrows will be dark okay when I
was younger I was really blown her
really young I was really blond and then
just as I got older it just like got
darker but then I started dyeing it like
right when that started happening so
I've never really seen my hair like nice
color my gosh her color is this right
here but the ends are dying blonde so
when my hairs down it like looks like
I'm all over blonde but when I heard up
it looks like yeah saying like where do
your favorite stores to shop that
currently ASOS I bought like five
hundred dollars worth of stuff from
there but I got like almost twenty
things which is like a lot
Urban Outfitters was always good like
you get one thing it's like 500 bucks
basically how is creating a YouTube
channel affected your life I've gotten
like cool opportunities also it's also
like involved like my sister South like
I've gotten to like travel stuff because
of travel places because of like my
sister stuff but I was like I met a lot
of cool friends like you and a lot of
other people I'm super cool I feel like
creating YouTube channel definitely
gives you a ton of cool opportunities
that normally if you
and just a lot of like life skills -
yeah like you do like being independent
like meeting new people like talking new
people like working with brands and all
that kind yeah it's really good stuff to
learn especially like well cuz we're
like 14 15 and that's pretty young to
have experienced already which is super
unique I also think on the downside of
it sometimes people treat you like they
just like care about your YouTube
channel and that's about it but overall
I'd say I would say it's like affected
my life for the good but yeah I
definitely agree with that though people
just want to be friends with like your
career and not you I also feel like I've
gotten closer with my sister because we
spent so much time together creating
YouTube channel like and making the
YouTube videos which is okay so now that
I literally have done nothing I feel
like I accomplished much we don't go to
school together we live like an hour
away we vote you together and then but
we both like we live it in just
different cities um how long we known
each other like a year and a half what
came first the chicken or the egg
why do you keep your long-distance
friendships LIVESTRONG we snapped on
each other like every yeah we snapped
out a lot like we try and talk a lot but
we're not really like long-distance I
mean long-distance can like yeah they're
fine December things like some people
took this value net like it's all like
across the country across the world or
like anything that's not like a five
minute drive away but spirit breakfast
foods banana and ice cream that's good I
don't really I don't even eat that ice
cream like I make that for dessert I
like I make aw I really should be nice I
make really good acai bowls you do you
always take pictures yeah I always like
send them as my snapchat sure you like
they're like I made good what's a good
age to start YouTube channel I think
yeah that is a big part but I think when
you feel that you can be independent and
you can do things on your own and you
don't have to depend on other people to
help you like obviously having help is
like just like your sister helps you but
at the same time right now we're filming
a video of ourselves you know so I feel
like once you feel like you are
independent then that's a good age to
start or I think also like if you feel
confident enough to do
because it definitely is yeah you're out
there evidence it's such a big part of a
YouTube channel cause like if you are
too afraid to put yourself out there but
like you want to be known even though
she's kind of like an oxymoron like if
you even if you are feel like you are
independent up if you're not confident
you're not gonna be posting any videos
you know we're also just carrying water
yeah that's it I was just gonna say that
you're like you can't care about what
other people think either just because
people um just like I had an incident
the other day like I was in this pizza
place I hope the girl isn't watching oh
my gosh please don't watch like I was at
this pizza place with my friend and this
girl was like screaming she's like oh my
god I was like this girl's famous and
I'm like didn't know how to react so
like I feel like that's something that
like you just have to be good with like
people - yeah well it's funny because I
went to I think I think it was like a
singing lesson thing or something I was
like I was trying to take singing
lessons I just say I'm not going to run
out but wait why you're a good singer
no I'm minute still seeing I'm just not
gonna take lessons right now I just feel
like yeah like I just too busy right now
but she asked me like this scene
something for it and I struggling so
much with like just like seeing in front
of her but she's like how do you know
it's before you know like every big
youtube channel I was like well like
that's an run up like I can't know an
actual person so it's funny because a
lot of people think that youtubers are
super social life going oh my gosh and
it one of them are but then the other
half like like there's so many
introverted you towards it like I guess
surely you're on quick story time um one
of my teachers found out about my
channel he's been marketing teachers so
he was like obviously really interested
in it like oh like how do you market
yourself all like stuff like that so I'm
really quiet clashed it's because I'm
introverted I'm quiet I like to listen
um so here's like oh like why do you put
up like this fake quiet person act like
it's not fake it's just so different
like when you're any other good camera
either top versus when you're talking
about a teacher early in a class or like
even to like a singing whatever it's
singing
yeah so it's just like really different
I'm not necessarily I II went through
this phase where I was so sure I like I
cannot talk to anyone
now so I started on my school I don't
know why but but like I feel like I can
talk in front of people it's just a lot
of the people expect you to be this
super outgoing boy like yeah when you
we're not like that coming first
the way I am on camera is basically
going off camera but but like at home or
just like with your friends no in front
of like yeah so I definitely not like
yodeling at school suddenly I'm like it
get a little crazy
you know for her she doesn't like her
hair right now I know it looks so weird
it looks so flax like I crypt it my mom
was like you need to put like product in
it so like the crimps actually stay
together and you don't weigh that when I
was done so I was like okay thanks do
you need new pal I know I know look at
that
you know it's still that stuff on the
crusty side of the pan still works like
it's gonna still set my face I'm sure
every night we are done you I got you oh
it's so much like taller than me are you
sitting up straight yeah maybe I have a
longer torso yeah it's not much I than
