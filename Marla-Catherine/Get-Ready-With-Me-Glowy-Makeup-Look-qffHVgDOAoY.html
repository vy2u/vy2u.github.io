box that's not cute should I put my harp
in the top so it's like Tarzan right now
hey guys I'm doing a makeup tutorial
psyche it's a get ready with me hey guys
it is Marla and today I'm gonna be
filming to get ready with me Plus this
is gonna be a vlog of one of the days I
was in San Francisco which is super fun
I went out to San Francisco because I am
a beauty ambassador for Sephora
collection which is pretty cool in my
opinion
I have not heard of basically they took
me out there and we went on a super fun
trip with all the other ambassadors and
all not know so for collection is also
sponsoring today's video so I like to
say thank you to them they launched some
new products for the springtime and I'm
going to be trying them out and talking
about them and sharing them with you
guys and I know I'm not in my hotel room
but because I didn't have time to film
it out there but I'm gonna be recreating
the same exact looked I wore in the
actual vlog when I was in San Francisco
without further ado let's get out so I
start off by moisturizing my face I'm my
skin's more on the drier side but it can
get super oily it's it's it's hard it's
combination skin but I always moisturize
because I don't want my skin to look
crusty and I feel like it just makes a
good a base so for the actual skin and
like face makeup you guys know that I
don't like to like cake on foundation
they launched a skint in and it's called
a Sephora collection a bright future
skin ttan and this has SPF 25
so especially well in those sunny days
or this will be great during the summer
in the springtime because the sun's
starting to come out a lot more and
won't protect your skin this skin tone
helps to like smooth out your skin and
make it look super healthy and glowy
obviously I really like that no makeup
makeup look and so this helps me achieve
that I'm actually using two shades today
and I'm gonna be mixing them I'm using
shade it number 12 and a shade at number
20 and then I'm also gonna be just using
one of these sponges to blend it out
this doesn't necessarily like cover up
your pimples but it definitely smooth
them out and it covers up the redness so
you can like go in with a thicker
concealer if you really want like a full
coverage but this definitely helps to
just make your skin like a very even
skin tone and very natural-looking now
I'm going in with my all-time favorite
contour
Pellatt and this is support collection
contour palette and this one is way good
I literally use it on almost all my
makeup tutorials because it definitely
has a wide variety of shades that way if
you are darker or lighter you know
there's a shade for you so I'm going in
with this middle bottom shade and then
I'm mixing it with the one right next to
it to the left and then I'm gonna
contour this little round ball that I
call a face and now I'm just gonna use
the same big fluffy brush this is
literally you could use it for so many
things once again it's the fifty-ninth
powder brush and I'm gonna be using at
my Sephora collection that blush palette
this is also one of my favorite that
what we're just caring about this is one
of my favorite blush palettes I mean who
am i kidding this is my favorite blush
palette I use it all the time I'm gonna
use this bottom middle color and I'm
gonna mix it with this bronzy
highlighter up here and then I just like
to mix those two and then shake it and
then I put on the apples of my cheeks
and I bring it up I'm gonna go with
white mm-hmm I'm gonna order through my
suit Sephora collection and beauty
amplifier and this is just a setting
spray this one works really well and
then I'm just gonna let it dry I'm not
going to use my Sephora collection at
bright future radiant Luminizer and it
this is literally a highlighter in a
concealer form in the sense of like the
tube like it's in a tube I really really
like the way this is and it's super
pretty like trust me the applicator
makes it way easy to like reach those
harder areas like a Cupid's bow and
underneath your eyebrow this is a super
lightweight highlighter so you can wear
it on top of your foundation or just
alone just on your skin and it doesn't
set into fine lines and it won't look
streaky so this is literally a ten top
ten highlighter and it's super natural
looking too I'm going to be using my
Sephora collection of bright future
radiant Luminizer in the shade number
three which is cognac and it's a super
pretty broad a glowy more gold tone to
highlighter so I'm gonna go ahead and
put this just how much it bones this is
actually such a pretty highlighter and
it's very natural looking eye doesn't
look like you took a powder highlighter
and when she like it just looks like oh
well your skin is glowing you know now
I'm gonna go ahead and do my eyebrows
well I'm gonna go ahead and do my
eyebrows off-screen and so I'll be right
back
now I'm gonna go ahead and set my brows
but oh and I set my eyebrows with my
honest Josie Beverly Hills brow gel this
one it's one of my favorites so now I'm
gonna go ahead and use my Modern
Renaissance eye
I'm just gonna go ahead and keep it
super simple but I'm gonna use the burnt
orange color and the golden ochre and I
just kind of mix them together and then
put that all over my crease in lid and
then I'm gonna go ahead and do my
classic who's Jo eyeliner on my top line
and then I'm gonna go in with my shadow
eyelash curler and curl my lashes and
then I'm gonna be using Sephora
collection lash craft length and volume
mascara and this is in the shade of 0-1
north which is just block and then I'm
gonna go ahead and use my Sephora
collection the hashtag lip stories
lipstick and this is shade number six
which is tan lines and this is my
all-time favorite one this one is
personalized to me if it literally has a
picture of me on it
so hashtag will never lose this so that
is my makeup look and this is what I did
for the vlog part of this video while I
was in San Francisco now let's go ahead
back to San Francisco and see what I did
there

actually here oh yeah I don't even know
how to explain it it's just it's super
cool very pretty
you're currently here at like the
flagship store we are here at the
 Sephora so that is so
exciting it's actually before opening
hours so we have the entire story
ourselves which is insane they have so
many products I want the peach palette
so bad anyway so I'm so ok so we're here
at the store and they have like this a
booth not a booth what is this like yeah
I just like a little setup for us to try
out their new makeup and they brought us
a breakfast and so this is some pressed
Juicery and then they hide a doughnut
and the doughnut has a little heart on
it so that's so cute so yeah because
they're super blendy a Mentos they're
not okay so I just wrapped up shopping
and I got some stuff
so I've been back at the hotel for a
while now it's been a while anyway um
I'm about to go to dinner so I feel
super overdress because everyone's
wearing sweats and yeah I not me I never
know how to dress for these at times
okay so we're here at dinner
these sweats are so soft as you guys can
tell I had a super long and crazy but
fun day and so now it's time for me to
take off my makeup I was supposed to
film this actually in the hotel room but
it literally was such a crazy day that I
didn't have time to film it but these
are the products that I would use to it
take off my makeup I'm Way excited
because Sephora collection and came out
with a cleansing balm let me show you
how to use it okay so I'm gonna first
put in a headband
so this product is cruelty free which I
any think is super important this makes
your skin feel so or nourished without
it feeling dry and it feels super
moisturizing it basically just like
melts the makeup off of your face and it
feels super cool this is Sephora
collection cleansing oil in balm it's
kind of a long name but it's super fun
and I love it and it definitely takes
off my makeup well so I'm gonna go ahead
and rinse this off so I'm gonna go ahead
and wash my skin with the philosophes
renewed hope in a jar and this one works
really well if you go
interested in any of the Sephora
collection products that I mentioned in
