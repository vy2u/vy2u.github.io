like we're all the blue lips they all
look so pretty they're only eight bucks
each two which is like drugstore cheap
but like they're super high-quality and
I'm so excited that the colors are so
pretty they have all these super cool
stores that go along with the lipsticks
which is super neat because it like
gives more meaning to your lipstick like
I don't just wear on film but I wear it
as a lifestyle like I wear just going

guys go follow them Sephora collection
lip stories launched online on December
13th and then in stores on December 26
so without further ado let's get right
on into this video okay so to start my
makeup I put on my Sephora collection
and make no mistake concealer and
concealer conceals all those ugly
pimples and after that I put on BB cream
this is actually CC cream but I wrote
the wrong thing you but CC cream just
evens out my skin tone and then I blend
it all in
don't want to be a little patchy girl
then I go in with my it cosmetics
setting powder I love a setting powder
so much then I fill in my eyebrows using
the anastasia dipbrow pomade and this is
super good and it lasts all night and
then i set it with the sun brow gel and
then I go on a fun hoola bronzer and I
brought to my face because I don't want
to be white that's not cool especially
when you're in California this is the
Sephora collection blush palette I
really love this ones there's so many
shades and then I curled my super
straight eyelashes then I apply some
hoola bronzer as eye shadow I then take
my Sephora collection at retractable
waterproof eyeliner and I put this on my
upper lash line to help define my eyes a
little bit more and then I apply my
Sephora collection and lash craft a big
volume mascara and this just makes my
eyelashes look super long and now for my
favorite part okay so tonight I'm gonna
be wearing from the Spring Break state
of my collection okay so I'm gonna be
wearing shade number nine this one is
called tan lines and I'm gonna be
wearing it I think all complements my
makeup look at my eyes and my outfit so
that's what I'm wearing tonight so I
already did a lip scrub on my lips and I
have moisturize them to make sure that
they don't look crest even upon the
lipstick so I did that and I'm gonna now
put this on it's a very neutral lip
color which is good for me because I
love lipsticks but I don't like to go
too crazy with them there's 40 shades so
there's definitely there's like a green
one in here and then white black like
they literally have like very bold
colors and very neutral looking colors
and there's a very wide variety and wide
range for you guys to choose from so
don't worry there's definitely a shade
for you guys I think this looks really
pretty actually okay so I just finished
up with my makeup I'm gonna go touch up
on my curls now and then I'm gonna put
on my outfit and show it to you guys and
they'll be so exciting so I'm gonna go
ahead and do that so I went with a
romper so this romper I bought yesterday
and it's from Topshop and it's
like this very soft denim I mean I got
my white t-shirt from brandy melville so
I got a pair of Birkenstocks first off
look how cute second off with how comfy
third look how cute and then Sephora was
super kind they did a collaboration it
was Sephora collection slash Eddie
Parker they made it for all the
ambassador's but I'm so excited but it's
really cute and it just says it's white
like marble and it's super nice and it
says Marla and yellow because they know
that I love yellow now let's actually go
to the event so I'm now ready for the
event and I am just going to the top
floor right now and we're up here and
it's nighttime it was so pretty and by
the way this lip color is going strong I
only had to reapply it once and it's
been like two and a half hours and stuff

ate a ton of food in between like it was
doing well hey guys so I just I just
