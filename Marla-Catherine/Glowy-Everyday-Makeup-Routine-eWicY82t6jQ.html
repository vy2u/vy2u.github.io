going to be a updated 2017 atmega
machine and I was told to us with makeup
recently I don't know what clicked or
what happened but I've been so obsessed
and I shouldn't have but I did by a live
show but new products and I'm so excited
to share them with you guys and really
so my first finger I've been doing for
size like two days okay let me back up
so I got this on Saturday and it's a
Monday so I can't really give an honest
review of what I think of it so I only
I've only worn it for a day I've heard a
bunch of good things about it and so
it's a toothpaste hangover primer and
I've never ever worn primer all the
timers I've ever used like make my feet
facial crazy and they don't even work
but I'm excited to raise money so I just
pumped out like a dime sized that's what
it looks like not too much but not too
little and I like to focus it on my
t-zone area cuz that's where I get the
most oily but honestly I don't even
really get that oily trying to get
screwed right which is really odd
because during the winter I get super
oily oily but then during the summer I
get so dry so this is smells so good it
smells like straight-up coconut oil I
love the smell coconuts and then that
whatever exercise hollowing out I'll
just rub on my eyelids because I don't
know if that works for eyeshadow but I'm
just doing it so now that's all blended
out I'm just going to move on to a skin
makeup I know like the professionals do
their eyes first but I don't like doing
that because then I'm like a freedom to
get foundational eyeshadow and then all
through stuff so I would do skin first a
lot of these products are high-end but
don't worry I'm doing a drugstore makeup
look soon because I know it's hard being
a teenager so yeah no I mean what some
oolong I'm gonna start off with Born
This Way Foundation but since this
summer I don't want this whole full
coverage I like using this concealer for
that but I do like this and so I mix it
in with a BB cream if you guys watch my
last tutorial um I like summer glow skin
this is like what I use for skin it's
not my favorite BB cream but it works
and so I'm using it this also not only
makes a nice combination of beauty cream
and foundation but it kind of Excel 52
through there also prolongs your
foundation
especially feels like a nice one so ice
you're like half a pump of my foundation
and then a good old pump of B cream and
then I just mix it with my finger I like
to focus on key zones and blend that out
and then I'll like blend out the excess
into the rest of my cheeks because once
my acne is centered imsd
center my face instead of I do feel like
this primarily hangover Too Faced one
makes like the foundation go on smoother
so I'm now don't look like face makeup
but I'm gonna go in and add some bronzer
blush because it's summer garlic
somewhat 10 so I'm using the usual so
hoola benefit bronzer and and Azula
hoola benefit dandelion blush I love
these two together they're so pretty so
I've been obsessed with the lusty
Russians even though I live one I want
to try them all so I you use this for my
blush and bronzer I'll shop it and this
one is the lefty by 14 a blush brush and
this is just it surprised fluffy and
nice so I don't really have to contour
just under bronze and now I'm doing the
flush this dandelion one is super
natural key and get in so I just took
like you're kind of like flush is that
the right word push push I also like to
just swipe a little bit sweet swipe a
little bit of blush all over my face gel
with my color we're going on to
concealer now and consumer is awesome so
this is the new product that I bought
and I've been wanting for the longest
time and I finally just did it it is the
NARS creamy and creamy concealer and I
am loving it so much it is so white so
literally this includes the wall so I
got here a broken up on put on all my
blemishes
I just like to like a natural not a very
subtle subtle subtle so a very subtle
highlight I just like put it up the
bridge of my nose and then I just blend
it out with my finger expected like that
works best and it is it like the maximum
full coverage because if you like the
Beautyblender is awesome but I do think
it absorbs a lot of product so now it's
getting that the Facebook of is done so
I'm going to move on to eyes and I
bought a Modern Renaissance fella I know
this has been out for like a year but
I'm just now like hopping on the train
I've used it for like a week now and I
love it so much I would highly recommend
so I'm just going to go in with this
Ecotools blend and smudge brush duo and
I'm going to be any color burnt orange
in sight as a transition color and a
crease Clark this one right here burnt
orange so I'm just going on on there and
then I'm going to go on to the crease
and I've been using this color so much I
really love it I love the color orange
so now I have the orange all blended out
into my crease I'm just going to kind of
define it just a little bit more like
going in with this color called rocky
Anna it's right next to it and it's a
very it's more of a brown orange I just
like to focus on my crease just to add a
little more depth it's a super pretty
like really warm brown and then on the
lid I'm going to use a super pretty
color right next to the burnt orange
it's called prime of Europe this is such
a pretty like natural highlight for your
eyes and it's more of a warm toned
highlight which is the look I'm kind of
going for today this is when I go to
eyeshadow look and I love it so much
it's like pretty natural looking but you
control it's still there so I love it
this eyeshadow look it's been so great
I'm going to go quickly it's all my
eyebrows normally when I do my like okay
so what I may be using is some a brown
eyeliner pencil which i think is so good
for if you don't want to buy like the
brawly's from EBSCO or whatever it is
once from carb candy the label is like
completely wiped off but I'm pretty sure
that's where it was wrong and then
chapstick and a little Suey and that's
what I've been using so I first have to
go and fill them in on the patchy areas
and I do
find my heart shot and then I did take a
little bit of chapstick so Dave make my
brows look so much bigger and I rub that
onto the spoolie and then I brush got
into my brows I just want to quickly
show you guys literally the difference
is still huge just I'm at traffic and
brushing them up makes all the
difference is before and after that I
normally just said it with hairspray
that way the chapstick ceaseless mascara
okay so I asked up is I'm mascara and
this is in a black brown I love using
black Browns it's not as intense and
it's waterproof this is the covergirl is
my absolute favorite
laughs quest boy
so that wraps up my everyday routine and
I will be going to enjoyed it and I
would highly recommend the water in
Renaissance tell it and I am sponsored
they didn't send this to me I'm just so
so it's a pretty good for like it's
super good and then it hit the subscribe
button we hit 80,000 thank you guys so
much I really really really really
really really really want to have
interfaces go tell your friends tell
your friends about me okay I'll see you
guys in my next video and the 605</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
