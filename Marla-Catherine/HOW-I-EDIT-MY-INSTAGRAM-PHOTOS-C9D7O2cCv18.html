because my dates with mom I'm just a
little bored hi guys it's mortola and
today's video is going to be oh like
literally the most requested video that
I've ever been requested in the
requesting earth earth but the crime I'm
like on a high because our AC is broken
so we're just trying to keep things
optimistic our AC broke today and I'm
just sweaty and I am overheated
overworked and / underappreciated and
I'm just having a hard time dissipation
of mana so today 0 it is a highly
requested how I edit and well actually
we because my sister's on that and takes
smooth and does everything I just find
the camera I mean I'm a private camera
but this is how we edit our photos on
that we post on Instagram and you guys
ask us all the time so let's get
straight into the field so well we use
to LA art photos on Instagram is
Lightroom and the filters that we like
to use most often is the vs yo filters
not many people know about this but vseo
actually has presets and filters for
lightroom and there's the VSA OS that
many people like basically everyone uses
but that's where you can get to design
your own filters and like at just a
little to how you want but then there's
legitimate like filters where like
automatically has it all set up you can
click on it and adjust it to what you
want so that's super cool and you guys
can get that on lightroom the actual
editing system does cost money and then
that cost separate
and but it's I think it's personally is
a really good investment if you are
wanting to go further with photography
and getting into that kind of business
and it is just it's a great an easy way
to edit your produce</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
