do a lot - of it go back
hold on Charlene Charlene it's 2:00 in
the morning
I got go hello everyone welcome back to
one of the Katherine and today's video
is going to how to fall asleep very fast
right now you guys could be watching
this at midnight and trying to fall
asleep hopefully this somehow helps you
and yeah let's get right on into the
video so my first hack for you guys is
something that everyone knows and yet no
one does and which is that no phone
before bed or no electronic devices
about a half-hour before you go to bed
I believe she like married him I think
you can do a buck -7 go back
hold on Charlene Charlene it's 2:00 in
the morning I got go okay this is my
septum oh you know I'm gonna sleep why
when you open up your right screen and
you're on it for a long period of time
right before you go to bed that your
pupils get dilated and I just stop right
now speaking it's still daytime
therefore you're not gonna want to go to
bed it's gonna have a harder time
falling asleep and readjusting to the
darkness so about a half hour before
kind of just like turn off all
electronic devices and your cables will
have an easier time
so next up for hype number two is taking
melatonin I don't know if you guys know
what melatonin is already but it is an
all-natural sleep
pill I use it all the time for
especially on sleepovers when I'm having
a hard time buying a little pill and it
helps me fall asleep so easily so if you
guys want to read up more on knowledge
honey I'll have a link in the downbar
next up but for hack number three is
listening to relaxing music right before
you go to bed or while you're trying to
sleep I do this all the time on Spotify
I you guys go follow me underscore Marla
Kathryn and I have a ton of playlists
and one of the playlists about is public
is it called relax and it's just a bunch
of my favorite piano music and composers
and a bunch of relaxing music pack
number four okay so it's making sure
your room temperature or just your house
temperature in general is a little bit
cooler than normal I actually have a
ceiling fan in my bedroom
take some have always a spray bottle
white next to your bed and then you can
just squirt it on you and then it makes
world wonders it cools down your body
instantly and guys don't drench yourself
don't take a shower in this pack number
five I like to listen to books on audio
and that helps me fall asleep and so you
guys can do that audiobooks they're
great hack number six this one's I don't
even know if it works I haven't tried it
out but I just found it online it says
if you sleep on your right side it helps
you fall asleep better compared to your
left side
so I don't know if that's true leave a
comment down below if you guys try it
out and it works
and at last but certainly not the least
is if you really are having a really
really hard time sleeping like you've
tried everything I do this last because
you have to get to do it but you could
go down and you can heat up a like a cup
of tea make something that's warm and
does not have caffeine I've never tried
warm milk but I don't know how it tastes
but if you guys want to do that because
one year that warm will I couldn't help
you calm down and yeah so that's a wrap
thank you guys so much for watching and
remember to give this video a big thumbs
up they can comment down below what time
it is that you're watching this video
okay hello guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
