Kathryn today's video is going to be on
my hair care routine so this is
basically just you know how to glow up
because this is what I used to look like
so to start out with so I'm going to be
giving you as a few tips on how to make
sure your ends don't start looking
string key when you're kind of grow it
out so I would start off with by not
washing your hair everyday because I
know that it's grosses out some people I
mean you can wash your body but just
don't wash your hair because when you do
your stripping your hair of the neck its
natural oils and then I'll have a hard
time growing so tip number wanting to
make sure your hair it does not get all
stringy at those is using like a
Moroccan oil or argan oil so on this is
the nourishing argon Oertel of Morocco
and you can just put this hair either
before or after your shower I prefer to
do it after and then so so it's almost
like a leave-in and then also you can
also use some like certs moving serums
serums coming your hair look more full
and just like soft and silky for all you
blondes out there you can use this
shimmering lights shampoo blonde and
silver and it basically just cancels out
cancelled out the butteriness and
brassiness and this is just a really
good replacement instead of toning your
hair so this is just a good way to
brighten up your blonde without done
your hair the next tip is if you are
going to go longer spaces without
washing your hair and your hair tends to
get greasy or greasy or oily more fast
you can always use a problem you can
always use a dry conditioner right now
my favorite one has been the mica appear
perk up dry shampoo it smells so good
and it works well and you don't even
need to go out and buy a fancy duration
cream you can always
baking powder so the next tip is to not
use about much hair much much hair
the next tip is to not use that much
heat on your hair it's okay to use heat
but just don't do it as often so like
the straightening irons like if your
hair is naturally wavy or anything
that's the look guy if you don't have to
go and straighten your hair um and then
there's also multiple ways you can just
go search it up on YouTube on how to get
like natural curls without using heat
anyway there's guys YouTube there go
Google it or do go YouTube it and also
if you are going to use heat on your
hair and relate blow-dry your hair
there's this is the red cam at Fifth
Avenue
pillow drive blow dryer and it's um for
used for when you blow dry hair it helps
it dry posture and it's also heat
protectant so you can use it for curling
your hair so next up is to be brushing
your hair consistently consistent one
the next tip I have for you is just to
brush your hair consistently and to not
let it get so ratty to the point of
where it's like having a hard time just
growing because it's so stiff and up
there and clogged up one of the most
important tips you might have not
thought of is to just change your diet
because what you're feeding into your
body is gonna come kind of come out like
it's gonna affect you like if you're
eating a lot of sugar you might get a
lot more acne I might have a hard time
letting hair naturally grow so change
your diet to a healthier just cutting
out a lot of the processed foods and a
lot of sugars and eat things in
moderation guys and it will help your
you just everything feels healthier
especially your hair man that's it for
today's video it was on little on the
shorter side but I will leak down in the
description box so on my favorite
heatless curls not no heat curls
remember you guys that you have to be
patient with your hair it's not going to
happen to overnight and just let it grow
out you can trim your hair but I was
just not doing it as often you might
you've heard that you should trim your
hair very like every six weeks
no leg or all ties is a pinky up split
ends it's impossible different way thank
you guys so much for watching

that was like that's not
because you guys should go follow me on
instagram at marla Kathryn I post a lot
on there a little too much just kidding
