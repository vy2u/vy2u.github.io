hi I'm Marla and thanks for clicking on
my video today I'm gonna be doing kind
of it yeah like you know speed dating
except I don't date no boys are
interested in me that makes me sound
side
today we're kind of doing a speed dating
except it's kind of like that except I'm
doing an Instagram Q&amp;amp;A and I'm gonna try
to answer as many as I can get to know
me become more acquainted with me love
me love me okay that's a little weird
today's video is also sponsored by
audible and if you guys already know is
I've been sponsored by audible before I
love audible my dad literally talks
about audible all the time I'll be like
dad you're talking about audible again
he's like I know most the time I like to
read if it's a good book but I always
love to listen to books you know there's
something about just playing my
headphones my eyes don't have to work
and I get a hear story story time all
the time during school if I had a read a
book I listened to it on audible because
it helped me out so much and I'd get
through the book so much faster and I'm
the type of person that I learn better
when I'm listening instead of reading I
don't know just how I work so anyway two
books I would recommend for you guys to
read is the giver and number the stars
and they're both by Lewis Lory
I don't think I'm saying her name right
but anyway they're amazing books and
I've read them before there's so many
books you guys can read but those are
just a few of my favorites if you guys
are interested you can go to
www.calculated.com/support down below
and yeah now without further ado let's
get into the speedy Q&amp;amp;A so everybody
Nass do you miss me no just kidding
summer yes you know I miss you I'm sad
that we weren't able to on the OC trip
together my biggest fear is probably
becoming something I don't want to be so
like a chinchilla or where do I plan to
travel next California Kali Lauren yeah
do I stand Tom Holland yes but not as
much as Andrew Garfield vans are
commerce definitely commerce but you
know nothing against vans I like vans by
the lake
do I know the muffin man I don't know
what that is wait should I know what
that is is it too soon for me to have a
boyfriend tag
nope except for the fact that I don't
have a boyfriend so what type of camera
do I used to feel my videos I use the
canon eos 5d mark 4 do you ever get hate
or get made up made mine of guys
followed I'm always gonna be a few
naysayers there's always gonna be a few
haters there's always gonna be people
that just like to rain on your parade to
answer your question yes but don't do
not let it stop you from doing what you
love I've ever bought stuff wrong we
know who inspires me my sister Evelyn
I've ever been to a concert yes I have
it it was to the Bailey Island one and
now I'm going to the California one in
less than a week and I'm so excited my
favorite song my favorite song is empire
ants by Gorillaz featuring little dragon
by plastic beat from the Plastic Beach
album is so good okay not everyone likes
that song but I love it so how do I know
my photos I edit my photos with
Lightroom but sometimes I added them but
most the time
Evelyn is but like my most recent Q&amp;amp;A
one I edit that one girls that was me oh
I wish I was dating for an old hard you
guys already know the answer to that one
a favorite place to shop I've been
obsessed with ASOS lately I probably
spent way too much money on there my
favorite celebrity is Finn wolf hard how
many siblings do I have I have five why
do I do that I feel like that's hard for
me to say I have there's four siblings
and I'm the fifth one so no I'm the
fourth the fifth there's four of there's
a total of five do I miss braces I think
about them every day and I just wish I
had them again my favorite youtuber is
Chris soup Dylan O'Brien that's like the
best video ever you guys got a Dylan
O'Brien date to channel you'll know I'm
a Joe Hanson has such good videos too
I'm a fear watching this you inspire me
where can I send fan mail I don't likes
a fan I likes a viewer mail viewer mail
cuz you know we're all just here
together I have a peel box actually and
it will be down in the description box
down below do I have a hobby I love
putting the guitar I'll open the piano I
like hiking that's about it my biggest
item on my bucket list I feel like it
I'm not the type of person to have a
bucket list it's just more like you know
I'm just gonna go where the wind blows
so is it hard balancing YouTube and
school if you guys don't procrastinate
things then you can totally do it yeah I
mean obviously it's gonna be hard
sometimes but most of the time it's not
how do I find my static I think it's one
of those things it's just Charla NER
obviously if he goes if you guys gonna
look at my channel like a year ago
please don't look at my channel a year
ago but like you know it's just
something you experiment with and then
you find out what you like I've ever
gone surfing
no but I think that's it sounds like so
much fun my model heck no how do I feel
about boyfriends I wish I had on tips
for high school you know it's so funny
everyone asked me that and I've never
even been so I don't know but tips for
junior high be yourself
participate in class and be nice to
everyone you never know who's gonna grow
up you know am I going to serve an LDS
mission that's something I'm definitely
not going to say a note to but as for
now I'm just kind of playing it as
things go that's probably something I'll
decide later down the road but if you
have no idea what that is then I am a
Mormon I'm a member of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter day States and
basically when you serve a mission it's
when you go out for two years and you
kind of just teach the gospel and teach
people the gospel of Christ and so I'm
not gonna say yes or no to that question
yet but yeah I would love to serve one
if you guys do want to know more about
my religion what I believe in then I
will have a link in the description box
down below to Mormon org for the future
reference if you guys want to be able to
ask me some questions I'll be up on
Instagram and I try to respond to damns
as often as I can and I also do these
posts every once in a while where I'm
doing a Q&amp;amp;A so go ahead and follow me at
mana Kathryn but thank you guys so much
for watching if you guys do enjoy it
give it a thumbs up and subscribe and
I'll see you guys in my next one bye
