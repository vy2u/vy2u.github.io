much to it visibles will helped me make
this video and so try to show you like
all the cute stuff is by far like this

arms are so high-quality they're so cute
and they're also really affordable so so
they won't be broke today so I do have a

this is also going to be doing a summer
giveaway where you can get a $500
wardrobe but something to do and all
details Ellie to the giveaway will be
down in the description box basically
everything is always in the description
so don't let's just get started all so
I'm going to start off with this first
item I slept in these last night because
they are pajamas they're the upload
creative gems that I've ever owned and
they're like pink with no clothes on
them like how cute is that
and so I'm neither perfect readers it's
like shorts and a loose top and so
they're super breathable and I
Stephanies all night and I had no
followings with them they're awesome
so our search the lenses some stars a
little bit different but clinics I don't
oriT these mom jeans and for once my
long jeans are not from the fish stores
so I can actually hook you guys up and
you guys can get the same one does me so
these are embroidered mom jeans and I
love the way these fit on me they're not
tight at all in that's perfect and they
have the cutest and border that little
flowers on side with like stoma birds I
don't want this hummingbird or what that
is but it's cute birds they have it onto
this side back side and then they also
have it down on the leg which is so cute
have 10 with 11 out of 10 would
recommend these jeans or some line so
this next item is this or distress it's
kind of washed out on camera but we'll
do close-ups so you can actually see by
say-so it a very pretty
on the website it's called is made ax e
because it's like not a maxi dress with
some not a mini joke become a tacky a
white lace address and a head comes with
a slit which is super nice I know some
people already dresses and they're like
see-through and then it doesn't come
with a flip so then you're stuck with
fine just slip adult and so excited
calling on we're interns all the voices
and want ain't me just kidding
so the next two items in public Marla
your regular Watson suits what do you
need more but I just finished it I just
got them so this first one is my
favorite out of the two of them it is
this beautiful blue color with little
pink flamingos gonna so the best part
about this to ensue is the fact that
it's an off-the-shoulder
really love the way this look and I was
kind of concerned that it was gonna like
go up my swim but when I was doing it
stayed it's fine the entire time which
is perfect and I also like that it
doesn't go up on your butt like bring a
new wedgie knees like this doesn't do
that at all so we're like this is just
so she cute into and I would totally
recommend it if you're in the market for
a new one or you just want another one
this next one too is the huge Saturn
ever but sadly I didn't really like the
way it fit maybe v-neck honest is a lot
lower than I expected it to be a light
came down to like right here so
sometimes lot just as I couldn't even
matters but I don't know I don't really
like the way that looked but they did
just super cute print and I would
recommend it if you guys are just like
if you like that local tight so the next
item I'm currently wearing and it is be
my most favorite teacher of ever owns
know that the tiger t-shirts and sisters
is number one but this is a close second
so it is massive nafta this is a NASA
t-shirt and I would want anyone for a
long time and it came out so much more
higher quality and I like to probably
the highest quality t-shirt I own and I
love the say I love the crewneck and I
love just the way this looks if you guys
do not know I am obsessive space and
when I was a little kid I either wanted
to be an astronomer or an ocean ologist
I really going to be either those
because there's no oceans in Utah and
space too far and then the next item is
this super pretty like this like a
peasant box mm-hmm I don't know this is
device the this is a very sheer shirts
that I have to like wear an undershirt
with it's just really sheer it is so
pretty on the top half its leg around
the neck area its sheer and that heavy
really creative flowers a border
or anyway but my third part of it is not
only the flower embroider flowers for
love embroidery but the collar
I love these Pierre Pan collars it
sounds are called fit super good what
are our can people where I want to put
it so just forgive us so these next
items are my favorite bottoms that I of
these I think the different favorite
bottoms are like most like out there
type bottoms that I own and they are
these wide leg trousers that are at like
my print stripes these are so these okay
when I wanted to the website I was like
I'm getting those like no one can stop
me and for a second off I was a little
nervous that they were going to not fit
properly when I got them I tried them on
at least literally could not say it more
perfect and I think you guys wondering
I'm 5 foot 7 and I got a size 4 and the
entire like boohoo web site is a very
affordable and almost everything on
website underneath $100 so these next
items are ice more bottoms for you guys
and by the way I think on almost every
single pair of oxide got size for us
size for so you're wondering but these
are very cute and very rich fish type
Jean uh this is a little different for
me it since it's like lone off on the
side low enough on the thigh it's like
fine but it's just as a cult they have
tentacles and their wrists and I ordered
these because I just want to see how
they fit in like if I like them and I
actually do I want to be ordering more
items like this but these are very cute
and they're very high-quality are kind
of worried because I know that sometimes
of my order ripped jeans online like
they're so flimsy and it's like closing
your rip if I try them on so date is
like up so it's good these are so cute
they're a they are embroidered at
boyfriend jeans and I really love the
color scheme on this it's like a maroon
white like a dark green and then this
blue wash which is so pretty so these
next items are short and Marla wearing
shorts yeah I don't really wear shorts
that often but I'm trying something new
you know I'm trying something new every
summer
kind of so these are super glowy and
blue shorts and I really like their
enemies it's a bike not paisley print
it's not Paisley
uh whatever princess is but it's like a
kind of a navy like royal blue on white
and they're super flowy and comfortable
and so it will be perfect for just
lounging out in the summer with super
hot and I don't want fun pants because
trust me I have those days so these next
short they are on a little bit on like
the shorter side for me at least but
they are very cute they look exactly
like eight greens actually if you go
watch the 13 videos or on my channel
they like visually looks exactly the
same but they're highlighted mom jeans
shorts and I pushed an in-sample bit I
was actually wearing this shirt and then
these shorts but anyway these look I
they are super high quality and they fit
really well around my waist and they
just look like really cute you want to
get these dogs home to get them because
like there's nothing really pulling back
unless you don't like me so this next
item is probably not as summery but I
just started too cute to pass up and
although if you guys live in Australia
or on the other side of the world that's
a meat that's probably the winter or
more of a rainy season this was really
really cute it's not Emily if I thought
it feels like a waterproof coat with a
contracted or eco but it is a super huge
and warm yellow rain jacket I'm just as
water rejected by use to go to Alex well
I'm going back to public school because
did not know but last year when I went
to public school I saw a girl wearing
this on school and I thought it was so
cute and never have it seen anywhere so
she's like so cute and then I saw on the
website and so I was like oh I'm gonna
guess I and I love the way this fits
I love lol oh and yellow when they're
thin colors now on to the next portion
of this video the recipe items I'm going
to show you guys are from something
called a Stella Hudgens collection and a
busy elaborated with type of girl named
Stella Hudgens and she got create smoke
her own clothing pieces I was able to
order a few of the items from the line
and so could sure
you guys did the last time around like
the edge your side and little wrenches
out a little bit from my style but I
think they're all so cute
this collection incorporates in a lot of
like this summer trends one OK by
Kingham embellished denim and just like
stuff like that so I didn't get too many
Jenko I don't think I got anything of I
got like so this stuff is all very
trendy this first item looks like it
would be super like uncomfortable aware
but I put this on is so comfortable and
it's super warm like it like I was
stirring so when I put it on probably if
I like my I wear this and religious and
say with it in public like just like
going up and down all the beads because
these and like rose gold is that not a
trend work like what so this next item
is blows my mind on how like I don't
know it's just so adorable and so I love
like I love it it's basically like the
product of our white striped trousers I
cannot seem kind of style but it's more
stretchy and it's just plain black so
these are a lot more casual like like
wear it anywhere they're so low e so
right just a way that these are are just
perfect like they're because I wouldn't
want to be thinking about these cooking
burning the pom-poms so the next I have
the Stella dense collection is a fanny
pack I'm like you probably are shocked
by that I haven't owned a fanny pack yet
because I feel like that's like like
part of my stylish I just haven't gone
round to get anyone and I finally did
sing it right or so useful like they
just sit right there on your belly you
can just print some granola put in your
phone you're good to go
like it's like an Aztec pattern complex
pieces to you guys baton and it's
embellished it has a cool sequence
really good I'm really into sequins so I
got a pair of these tennis shoes and
these are two really nicely nice they
are lost differ like like more heavy
duty feeling that I thought they're
going to be but these are the world's
bold at tennis shoes and I love how
they're kind of like thicker I think
that's so cute and even the laces are
like real gold and if you're actually
really comfortable so this next iron
from the salvage inside is very cute and
very edgy if you guys think
say the word edgy I think of Nicki damar
so that's not like the type of edgy that
I Kissed eyelid
don't listen meet I love our be green
jackets but this one is studded and
stubs are like I remember so if such as
does back in like my sister got a
studded purse and then like she handed
it down to me when it like got broken
and I felt sided and still on it anyway
because I love studs long story I loved
us stop going to make sense at all but
what makes the jacket super cool is the
back has embroidery roses so China has
like roses a growing tiger I'm probably
going to wear my tiger shirt with this
you know like the warranty one with the
big tire everywhere I probably wear that
with this jacket and then it has like
part and we're flowers for you and last
but certainly isn't it all of the best
action so a lot of certainly not delete
item is to suck that right here so this
is a backpack and I am obsessed as
backpacks I think they're so cute and I
like them or the person because they
don't like hurt your shoulders like it
distributes the weight better but this
is like more like a mini more casual
back rack and so I love it as patches
might like this smiley face a Rob 56
fashion thing and add like a concealer
what is this it looks like a flag on
global Billy's and I also have studs so
like I'm all about that fits today I
really like it surprisingly like might
fit a ton of things in there I filmed a
lookbook and I did will fit all the
outfits inside of here which was really
good because I have to carry around the
time job by the way if you guys have not
