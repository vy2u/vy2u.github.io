I'm here going to be doing a collab with
far above rubies it's a YouTube channel
and it's two girls and they make really
cute videos and they are going to be
doing breakfast and after school lunch
ideas so if you want to see those videos
click the link below so we are going to
be doing the lunch ideas so keep on
marching if you want to find out okay to
start off with our first lunch we have a
the classic PB&amp;amp;J now this is really
yummy it's easy and it's fast and well
if you're allergic to peanut butter you
know it's not for you and as you can see
I'm just sliding it into my SIB la
baguette so for our vegetable part we
have some celery and I can you can just
cut that up into little pieces and then
you can take some jiff to go peanut
butter and you can dip your celery in
there and I think that's really yummy
and I just put it into a container and
sealed it up and there you have it
I guess you're lucky that it's time so
for our fruit we have an orange and you
can simply just cut that up and you can
put that into a ziplock bag now this is
really yummy and it's healthy now if you
don't really like orange juice you can
always do apples or plums or peaches
whatever you like
so after you have your food all prepared
you can just take your cute lunchbox you
can put that in there I added in a
yogurt because it has calcium and it's
healthy for you
and there is our first lunch idea so for
a second lunch idea I just have some
protein roll-ups OSHA's ham and I simply
rolled it up you can always add some
cheese into here because I know some
people like that but that's not my
favorite so that's why I just did plain
town after that you can add in some baby
carrots and I prefer the baby carrots
and but I prefer the baby carrots over
the large ones and after that I just
took some applesauce and it's the
squeezable kind where you don't use food
then I added a banana yogurt and a water
bottle and there you have it you're
ready to go
I'm so thirsty good thing I brought my
water that Marla Catherine told me to
bring and if you're not very big on
lunch you can always take a protein bar
or a green shake just like I have and
it's very yummy and it keeps you full
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed the video because I had
a lot of fun filming it
making your own lunches a lot healthier
and easier and so I are waiting you some
more ideas because school is about to
the Vario and healthier for you and I've
heard that they have growth hormones in
it that makes you like grow faster or
like makes you bigger and not taller but
it's another way wider that's kind of
little and you know one time with my
