going to be doing an updated skincare
routine you guys have been noticing that
skins been clearing up and so this is
what I've been doing
the first step to wash my face is
removing my makeup and I use coconut oil
and it is the best ink ever and it takes
off all waterproof makeup which is
awesome the first step is to wash your
hand oh wow okay no really wash your
hands first I forgot to but my hands are
pretty clean before now that my makeup
is like melted off I'm going to remove
that with the glossy milky jelly
cleanser and this is the best stuff ever
because I have really dry skin
tomorrow the dry side and this is a
conditioning face wash and so it's
perfect and I would highly recommend
this I've n followed that with the milk
matcha cleanser and this is so good like
all these products are holy grails and
this is just like a gentle exfoliator to
like get rid of dead skin cells and dry
patches and all eyes gross stuff and
then I follow that with the milk matcha
toner this is not a sponsored video I'm
pretty sure this much of stuff has been
what's like clearing my skin the most
and I would highly recommend this stuff
I then it follow the toner with the
milky the pixi milky missed a lot of
this stuff is like milk
lilia every single I just realized every
single product in this video has like
the word milk in it that was not planned
except for this product and then Mario
Badescu drying lotion is the honestly if
you don't have it what are you doing
this removes my acne so fast I put this
stuff on my blemishes and it get R it
and it gets rid of them overnight which
is perfect because who doesn't want that
and that wraps up my skincare routine
it's Lucy our last video and in this
video is like oh my trigger and then the
last minute like love for nice person
there's light turn off device that donor
like this where good job like it or not
when I do okay right oh my - I feel good
