turn the camera races you want every
junkie needa are always something stuck
in there
you also me that back nope try it and
print it that's an ugly backwards and
how hard you want so much hey guys hey
ok I'm overheating hi guys it is Marla
and today's video is going to be how I
edit and film my videos and before I get
into this video I'm just going to make a
disclaimer at that I do not edit my own
video my sister and I do this YouTube
channel together so she's behind the
scenes and she does it but I'm still
gonna be telling you guys how she does
it so like this is what we do and so
let's just now get started so first off
her top are one of our most asked
questions is what camera do I use and
then what is a lens so the camera is the
Canon it's immediatey osm unique and
then we went is this Sigma one point and
then it is the siga and I got connector
Fitness so then the lens is the Sigma 30
of millimeter at 1.4 length and I really
like this one since it gives you like
that where it's a crown kind of you know
and I used to go with a Canon t3i which
was a great camera but the reason why I
upgraded it is because this one has
autofocus and so it's so much easier to
mounting you don't have to worry about
your cameras being out of focus then the
lens that I just recently purchased is
the Canon at 10 to 18 millimeter lens
and this one is awesome because it gives
you that super wide angle lens which is
great for filming a videos like outside
or when you're doing a room tour and all
that good stuff it sounds like my search
tour video with this so if you guys want
to check it out and see what it looks
like I totally recommend this have you
been considering buying it and then it
sound like videos that you don't need a
tripod but we want it to be a stabilized
music on so this is called the monopod
so this is a monopod and it's super long
right now it can get super long and if
you get like super short basically units
of two moves on to your camera and then
it stabilizes it so when you're filming
like shots of stuff so I got this on
Amazon for ten dollars which is such a
great like investment or whatever
because it's so awesome
just by amazonbasics I'll have links to
literally everything in it down in the
description box so you can go check it
out I get a ton of questions on how thy
lighting always seems to be like pretty
even and precise so I use a combination
of natural lighting and box lighting so
Bob starts I use our the limo studio box
sides I often want to Amazon I'll have a
link down in the description box but
they're super awesome they've held up
super well and may or may not drop them
a few times so the light flicker behind
design but other than that they held up
pretty great I bet if I didn't drop them
that they then they would be fine I have
two votes and they're like $70 I think I
think such a great investment for your
YouTube channel because it has
consistent lighting and if you cannot
afford about that you just don't really
want to get them then just so I'm not
facing the window so I normally have a
window so to this I'm the eyes natural
lighting and I'll have a box light on
this side it that way it's even my name
coming around everywhere oh my goodness
this is why so many times I did get a
ton of inspiration from other youtubers
and seeing what they're doing and how I
can put my own spin on it and make it
more customized me so the block camera
that I film with my blog Charles kind of
banded I am blogging this Thursday it's
my birthday on Thursday get hype so that
it can be birthday vlogs
well I belong with the canon g7x which
is a basically every single blogger on
YouTube uses cameras just because it's
small and it's great and it has really
good quality while quality quality
quality so my sister like I said my
sister does edit the videos of chooses
the program that called Final Cut Pro
which a ton of people use it's super
awesome and we used to use Sony Vegas
but we switched people ask all the time
what we color great our videos with
because you just ask all the time we
collaborate with Lightroom
and we'll just let make a preset and
then put on to the video we use a ton of
the vseo visco whatever you wanna call
it we use a lot of their presets because
they're super good and we just render it
through what you're and all that good
stuff so whatever our next most
frequently asked questions is where I
find my music and what type of music do
I use so most of the time I'm trying to
get better at it but putting the music
like the name of music in the
description box because I get so many
calls about it I find all my music
either on Spotify which is mostly just
Spotify it's at underscore mod Katherine
I have multiplayer all the songs I put
on my youtube videos inside my playlist
they can just go follow me there
follow me Makena purple icy air gonna
fall off I can feel it there keep
touching I literally I was sitting on my
feet like I was kneeling down but I was
sitting on my feet and my feet I took
them out and they were purple so don't
do that kids don't try it at home um and
then see at last tips and questions that
I get asked all the time is how I make
my thumbnails so I PicMonkey to make my
channel banner and Michael Mills and so
also I just wanted to pitch it to you
guys the thumbnail is what will make
your videos go viral and it is what will
make your videos get views and all good
stuff okay what I'm trying to say is you
can make a super highly edited really
net filmed big production YouTube video
but something's not good then you most
likely you're not going to get any views
but you've never really really really
good some now and just film a YouTube
video on your phone and it cause it'll
viral so it all depends on to some now
and what you do I try to avoid cliff
Bait I don't everyone's a different
opinions on that but a little bit of
clicks a is fine every once in a while
make sure your title and your thumbnail
are coordinating and that it looks good
and it looks like you would use clip on
it yourself so that's basically it so
this was all of my tips for how I go and
edit my youtube videos and plus a few
bonus tips in there if you guys want to
start a YouTube channel thank you guys
so much for watching I have links in the
description box to everything I
mentioned and that is it so I'll see you
guys in my next
video and enjoy your day your evening
good morning but I was scary they really
black they're gonna fall off they look
fine I could feel the seams right I
think you're being dramatic oh you'll
never be my hometown there's nothing
like a bridge
I'm tired of the gate around 8:00</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
