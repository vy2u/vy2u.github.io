Vale so my room actually on trouble the
other gate expiring between Betsy for a
very long time so I thought what
happened this video so today's video is
all about cleaning your room and can do
it like adjustably and organize it and
how to do it super fast so is what I
actually do like to clean my room really
fast and so I hope to do so cool for you
guys and be productive and after you
don't want you to go clean your instead
of watching any more YouTube videos
unless they're mine and that's okay so
yeah let's just go into it so the first
thing is to make it fun so open up your
blinds some pump some really good jams
and this will just get you in the mood
to actually clean your room can also
take before photos that way you can show
how your room quota so the next step is
to make your bed because when you make
your bed making your bed is super easy
but it feels the clump like you feel
accomplished after doing it so it's a
really nice start to cleaning your room
a lot of people ask where I've gotten my
pillowcases from and they're from Urban
Outfitters next up is to make piles of
stuff and it all sounds kind of weird
but like put all your clothes into a
closed file to all your random stuff
into a random pile to all like make up
into a pile that way it's a lot easier
to put away the stuff and to clean I do
this almost every single time a clean
room and it works so well the next step
is just focusing on one area so like
take one area at a time so I chose to do
my desk and that way is a lot more
efficient because like you get that area
of the room done and then you can move
on to the next area and before you know
it you'll be done so just putting away
stuff and making sure that you're
staying on task a little tip is to just
take a clocks wipe and wipe down your
desk area because it just makes it feel
so much cleaner and I have stains on my
desk so I promise it's not like a broken
Clorox wipe or something it's like not
working just have a bunch of stains on
my desk just dude the next tip is to
just stay organized clean your room for
like ten minutes every single day and
then that way like you maintain a pretty
clean room and then it doesn't get
build-up into the shagging trick mess we
need to do all one's big headache
so just clean your room for like ten
minutes every day just a quick tidy hang
up your clothes you know put away the
socks if you run around
this makes clean your room so much
easier and also easy rims phrase when
you're done cleaning your room just
finishes it off and then you don't have
that like sweaty stench from all your
hard work and then you're all done now
look how good this looks having clean
room makes me feel so accomplished and
productive oh thanks guys for watching I
really hope you guys enjoyed it and you
have to go and clean your room
subscribe and I'll be a good mom back to
the G ahh
