my channel and if you know here
subscribe today's video is going to be
how to achieve slow freckles I think
couples are the ultimate thing in the
world
and if you guys have them while I'm
jealous I love them and this is how I
achieve at micro freckles without
further ado let's get into the video so
to start off this both freckles that you
are going to need it just a few products
prior to one seed is a water color paint
that is non-toxic and state and won't
kill you need some water
a paper plate and a toothbrush so I did
see this method already on YouTube and I
wanted to try it out will have the video
that we got inspired by it is own link
down below so to start it off you're
going to need your people play already
used it and stuff on it I'm kicking it
my water color non-toxic paint and this
is in the color burnt umber I think it
looks the most natural brown and out of
all the sheets at home then I have a new
toothbrush that I've used for this
already don't use them tooth brushing
teeth anymore refuse meanness and then
I'm going to be using this some of this
brave all of those Lauren it but you can
just use regular water so we started off
I meant taking just a very small amount
of my paint and make sure it does have
to be water color it because it if it's
too thick it won't work and I really
playing this a very small amount
anything a very small amount like it
that much not even not too much this
little does go along the way it was
water coursing afternoon we're not going
to take my toothbrush and I'm going to
sprayed like four times with my water
it's Road water but now just use regular
water just ask what and then I'm going
to go in and I eat my paint okay so like
I said a little does go a long way so
now I have all this stuff anyway so now
I'm going to take my toothbrush and I'm
going to put it into the diet and make
sure that we just made it and then
you're going to flip out onto your face
and before I get started I am going to
say this is completely just personal
preference if you just
few freckles and it don't take too much
and you want a lot and then you can do
as you want this all over your face I'm
going to focus on this area and a little
bit on my forehead and a little bit on
my god you take all my time again so you
guys can stop right now if you just want
you freckles but I'm going to go all out
and I'm going to have a walk so tied
together
so it will got a little crazy on us and
we know so I'm fully gonna go on this
teaches and uh but the most part I think
this is open opportunity one to the help
so I'm going to go in a brown mascara so
this is what the completed look look if
you guys do try to sell it obviously
will look different because they look
different so you can always add more or
add less or but basically this is how to
achieve the faux fur look I think
Purple's is still cue and it does happen
actually the nine photos I think they're
so cute I've always talked you know I
think this doesn't add to face remember
to subscribe and give this video a
thumbs up I will be guys in here too
much for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
