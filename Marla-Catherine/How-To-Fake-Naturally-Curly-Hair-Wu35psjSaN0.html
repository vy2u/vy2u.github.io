Marla Kathryn and for today's video you
are going to be learning how to get
naturally curly hair it looks like it's
too hard to tame but it wants you it's
not and I'm going to show you how to get
the look really easily and you can sleep
on it later than sleep on it yeah let's
get right on into the video okay
so discharge their naturally curly hair
you're going to want here just take a
brush that way when you braided you
don't have a hard time do order regular
part language because I try to a bunch
of different part lines and if you part
it where your hair isn't naturally my
hair naturally hurts right there or in
the middle and if you just part it like
on this opposite where it's either
anything your hair's naturally good
waterfall that way since you slept with
it on my book and that's not good is
that up on the school day all this on
your hair should be like popping my life
can't mine about a little bit awesome
you're going to start off we're going to
do a Dutch because for some reason it
makes sense look a little bit more
voluminous and natural this literally do
boxer braids except do them a lot higher
than usual so this are off the radio and
I want I pick up three geek since I
sections and you're going to watch you
take a duck the difference between a
Dutch and a regular French braid is
Dutch is rating the middle and you cross
it over instead of under so I'm grabbing
pretty much the same size pieces and
you're going to work your hair where
it's going straight back and this could
occurred and so straight down
so I'm ready now as far as possible okay
now that you've got as far down on your
grade as possible you're going to want
to secure it but this is the trick that
most people don't know when securing
your grades because if you look at
regular Chris they like have this your
hairs all creepy then it's like a
straight line and that's you can tell
where you stop reading so we're going to
do is I like to double up my rubber
bands that's why I know for sure that
they won't snap a little the night when
you're wrapping it around you like - um
like I don't want kind of I explained
this but you like go down and so it's
not all on the same place if that makes
any sense so this is kind of what it's
going to look like when you rubberband
it it's gonna look like this jumbled
mess but pro I promise you it will be
just fine and it'll work out okay so now
that you have both of your braids done
just spray your hair very lightly with
some water because that just makes it so
when it dries it's for sure it's gonna
keep its hold a lot longer and yeah
after you do not sleep on it literally
just go to bed I'll show you guys what
the after product website in just a few
seconds okay so now that I just open up
obviously wearing my matching pajamas
that mean I won't have matching any
other sister II feel like to match this
oh hi so now that you've woken up and
you sub your braids on um you get to
take them out and
very much to me okay now that you have
done that maybe all the time okay now
we're going to pull all your hedges run
and then you want to take your very
expensive brush hey Bob but also I'm
very quickly brought to your hair you
will really ballad TMI if you find that
if you have more volume or your hair
gets too it gets really flat throughout
the day with mine then you can always go
in and tease it at me
we should not do back combing or you can
take a just like a touchable hair spray
like this one by Tomica go check them
out and then you just spray it on it so
that way your hair can will still stay
back to your seat please that makes
sense
okay thanks for watching and remember to
subscribe because it's free
and you hear the speech every time you
watch a YouTube video but you should
just subscribe give this video a thumbs
up and love you guys so much and bye
now that you have taken out okay now
he's cut is go face like boyfriend me
BAE
