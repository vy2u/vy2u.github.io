channel so today's video if you could
not tell I'm gonna be doing a guy how to
be an Instagram model it's obviously I'm
super qualified not really so honestly
being an install model is basically
where you model on Instagram so there's
not really many requirements but these
are just some of my tips and tricks to
look better on Instagram and how to be
more photogenic and how to have that
Instagram Abul look I'm gonna show you
guys some of my favorite poses how I do
my hair how we do my makeup and my
outfit idea so this video is also
inspired by hailey Sandy's I think it's
how to look bomb without trying I think
that's the title of the video I'll have
a link down below
I saw her video and I was like that's
actually super cute so I want to do my
own twist on it so show it to her and
then I hope you guys enjoyed this video
if you day to give it a thumbs up you
know the drill and without further ado
let's get right on into it so my first
tip is minimal makeup and what I mean by
this is less is more when it comes to
Instagram models that they never really
have like a caked face like it's instead
of covering up your features you're just
enhancing them so I start off with like
priming my skin and I've already washed
my face and brush my teeth and all that
stuff I'm using this cooling water from
mouth makeup I love this stuff so much
it makes it like basically deep puffs
your eyes I then moisturize my lips so
basically start off with like a good
base and that will make your makeup
always look so much better so I don't
put on foundation really ever and I just
like to put on some concealer underneath
my eyes and then on my problem areas and
the less makeup you put on the more
flawless your skin's gonna look just
trust me on this so instead of putting
like an entire layer of makeup on your
face just put it where you need it and
I'll just make your skin look so much
better
so after that I like to put on a little
bit of bronzer I just feel like this
looks a lot better in photos and in real
life I just like to be a little bit more
tan what I actually am and then I put
the hoola bronzer onto my eyes and you
see as i shadow i literally love doing
this so much I found it out through
summer routine and I've never stopped
doing it since it just it works really
well and I put a little bit of blush to
to make my skin look flush and then I do
my brows and instead of making them
Instagram like blocky brows I just like
to make them that cute Tumblr feathery
and I just kind of fell in my arch to
find them a little bit more and then put
on brow gel and then I get like super
wrapped up into doing my eyebrow
and then I like take a step back from
the mirror and then I realized that
they're super intense and then I'll go
in with some wet wipes and I'll just
clean out my eyebrows and just make them
a little bit less intense and then I put
on some brow gel now after that I go
ahead and I curl my lashes and put on
mascara and I also like to put on this
brown gel eyeliner on my lash line I
normally do this only for photos but
this like makes my eyes just pop out a
little bit more and this helps in
Instagram photos this is my minimal this
is basically my everyday makeup look but
it looks super gonna photos - my next
tip is to whiten your teeth a lot of
Instagram models have super candid
photos where they're like smiling and
they're looking back and all that cute
stuff and if you have butter teeth it's
not gonna look as cute so I like to use
these crest 3d white strips this isn't
sponsored or anything I bought these
with my own money but I just use them
every other day for 30 minutes while I'm
like doing my hair or while I'm doing my
makeup my next tip is to have that like
messy textured hair in most cases having
straight hair isn't gonna look the best
so these are just day two curls of my
hair and then I add some touch-up curls
this just helps your hair to look a
little bit more textured and more
movable in photos and it just looks a
lot more photogenic
my next tip is to have outfit goals
honestly outfit goals is definitely just
whatever your style is so I like to go
for a more relaxed kind of it's a
striped long-sleeve shirt and then I'm
wearing some two-toned pants from the so
aesthetic shop that I don't think they
sell them anymore I'm super sorry
basically any outfit that kind of
contrasts and we'll look popping in your
photos will be good and by now I've
taken off my whitening strips and my
teeth look slightly whiter my next tip
is to know your angles so this is gonna
sound super weird but pose in the mirror
practice taking selfies I know you're
gonna feel it feels like super vain but
like if you want to get a good Instagram
photo you have to know what is your best
angles and what isn't so just practice
put on some fun music just do this but I
promise you guys it helps when it comes
down to actually taking a photo well did
