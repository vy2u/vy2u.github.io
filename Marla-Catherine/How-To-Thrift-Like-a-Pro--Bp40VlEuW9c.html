hey guys it is Marla and today's video
oh yeah let's acknowledge to the
elephant in the room
I don't anyone Yi I'm so excited but not
actually our pants and my intros are not
too happy about today so it's going to
be how to perfect like a pro no it's not
it's kind of coffee conan video I was
super inspired by him and so I wanted to
just take my own spin on it and what I
do personally so I don't even enjoy it
and let's just get started start off I
always history to the jeans because
jeans are like my favorite thing to look
for historic tireless team I normally
start a small and I go all the way
around even to the light extra large
because sometimes for workers but it's a
small change in US size large just mean
that sits right here so I love mom jeans
but mom jeans are kind of hard to find
this on a hangar so what you need to
look for is normally they're
high-waisted or they also have a tag
like right on them like where the tag
talk is we don't have a tag right there
if they're high-waisted I mean if
they're bumping so we just really have
to look through every single one and
hope that you find one so these kinda
look give these look like mommy love
that di also if you're not sure just try
it on because you never know I wasn't
sure I know finding a pair of like
nineteen turbo man's longings there so
she over and I wasn't sure about and I
was picking him up him and try them on
and I love that my favorite pair of
jeans ever now we're traveling into the
medium section
tomorrow there's a kid crying audience a
point we're now in the men's section
because Ben's always has like to do good
like vintage t-shirts for today
so basically a message tour that is
going to be good clothes everywhere so
don't be afraid to just look in one
section look everywhere so don't even be
afraid to look in the men's section or
because they have really good t-shirts
okay are you gonna get it the dollar
hey through the nice- a gamble by my bed
nobody got assigned to see you planters
in the garden
wow I've never found a pair of shoes at
the thrift store but you know a lot
might change
- Shh
I'm getting these you cannot taught me
this would be $60 IKEA
I bought what's my cat I know this is is
it a be $8 country this will buy a boy
I'm getting all these no Tommy
sometimes a bunch of plants and I said
where did you get those if you sit in
the yard area so guess where I found
when you plant in the yard area so you
guys didn't ask people if you see
something like maybe pay them for it
snatch it from them
the next step is to not only shop in the
cool section but shop in like the food
and fur food so I'm now that in order to
do regular bills intersection because
sometimes they're good for just like
summer top and also sportswear is great
I am on
the next step is to listen to headphones
to listen to music and like putting some
headphones to relax you and to make you
focus so that's our men do sometimes you
just have no look at the thirst or do
not I not be short sleeve knit top
because the surgeons always nice when
sometimes you can like to find a really
cute t-shirt for during the summer so
another tip is to when you holding up an
item for this example not my size okay
imagine it in like a high-end department
stores like would you buy it fit in that
high-end department store because
sometimes like where that their stores
can kind of be like Dungey or dun Jia
Xin Jie you're like run down so I'm
going to not really like the product as
much but just have an open mind like
Conan gray said and just but it's so
true like just imagine it in my urban
outfitter says something like an
oversized t-shirt probably will most
likely buy it at Urban Outfitters
compared to a short but this stories you
get them for like a buck so we're now in
the checkout line really excited and so
happy I found me Carla wants all of
those with the lady left him in our card
honestly you think the lady left I think
she did I think so
this sympathy I told you that it all fit
and the very much tip you cannot forget
is there are so many germs in there it
is ridiculous so you don't you're
washing immediately just go in from
Phantom changer thank you guys so much
for watching I hope you guys enjoyed it
and you go and you sir can you find lots
of cute stuff and take pictures with in
your tags me and all that good stuff so
in this video it thumbs up and subscribe
if you guys want to and I be awesome and
still have a good day and I'll see you
guys in the next video bye I'll mostly
just win just baloney I kind of like how
far away it is because now you can't
really see me please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
