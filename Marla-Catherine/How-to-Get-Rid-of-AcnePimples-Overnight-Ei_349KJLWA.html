guys leave a bunch of comments about how
keep my shirt is I'm just gonna let you
know where I got it um infinity alkyl
comm was kind enough to send me a few
shirts and this is probably my favorite
one out of all that because as you know
this video is going to be how to get rid
of acne overnight bonus overnight
because you know being a teenager we all
struggle with the everyday breakouts
pimples blackheads plus everything that
was gross
anyway and then disclaimer no I'm not a
medical student a doctor I know I'm not
even in the eighth grade let's get right
on into the video so this is my routine
on how I try to get rid of acne for all
you girls out there and if your boys
watching this I don't make up boys
that's know so if you are waterproof
mascara normal mascara foundation
whatever the heck it is coconut oil it
is the most natural way to remove all of
your makeup
so after I've cleared off all my makeup
with coconut oil nature's Neko remover
oh you're going to start to wash your
face so there's millions and millions of
like brands for face washes and
everything but these are just two of my
favorites and they're probably really
calming you guys probably already know
about them Johnson's baby into tosche
and this stuff is just so gentle on your
face and so it's in refreshing but I've
actually been using this one more often
and it's the Dino positively radiant
brightening cleanser and it helps even
out your skin tone so it's not as
squatching because oli like one day just
wake up about this big red spot right
there i don't we so after i have just
ruined my makeup you just put this on
over it and then you like what it sit
for about five minutes and then once
it's dried you take warm water and wash
it often diving above them something
i've been doing recently and I'm sorry
playing clean and clear but this one
works a million times better it
literally makes your face look like
you're just reborn you now I'll have a
new face that's what I'm talking about
but it's called health and beauty Aztec
secret Indian healing clay okay
this was five bucks on Amazon first you
take about a spoonful of this powder
stuff it's like a powder like I'll show
you guys in a second um you think about
a spoonful of this and then you can take
about a spoonful of either apple cider
vinegar or just plain water I prefer to
use apple cider vinegar because it works
better with this stuff even though it's
reeks and you put it into the bowl and
then you mix it together and it be and
it should have a good pace like
consistency and then your spear that on
your face with either your cleaners or
with a spoon that you used or fork and
then you just let that on for about 15
to 20 minutes and then rinse it off with
warm water and there go so after doing
all that you are going to want you
sir eyes your face I use a great unique
this is the knockoff brand of the Olli
and now you're probably all wondering
like I've heard all the stuff before how
do I actually get rid of acne overnight
this is a trick guys you take toothpaste
you know like what toothpaste no that's
for your teeth um you just take about a
pea-sized and you put onto your finger
and then you put that on all your
pimples let it dry overnight and then
wash it off in the morning and what it
does is will reduce the redness we're do
swelling dry out the temple and I'll
make it smaller so that's just amazing
and this is really the secret weapon
this one is a do not ever winners do not
don't pick at it don't pop it no no
popping it is like the worst thing you
could do for your face because learn
this from our shield beauty it literally
makes so much sense when you pop your
pimple you're like going like that don't
do it to figures any tweezers and you
just don't pop it because when you pop
it all of some pus comes out the top but
then the rest explodes underneath your
skin and then you just get more pimples
surrounding I want to know when you pop
that those get more people than that
anymore and the last and final tip
legitimately
the easiest thing drink my water
see this was filled up this is I promise
this is barf tell me that's not my usual
thank you guys so much for watching
remember to give a big thumbs up for
clearing acne dem bums and drinking just
subscribe fight you name I don't
mommy mom Missy unif named my daughter
after the Loch Ness monster
pinky oh please fresh my eyeballs don't
want to get away for this
why did I do that
when this dries in you like you can't
even move your face because I can't
Botox kicking all closer cause of like
the Lighting's better okay
