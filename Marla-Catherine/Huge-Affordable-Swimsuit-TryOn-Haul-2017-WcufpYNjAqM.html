to my channel
today's video is going to be a VA 2017
at spring try on some to haul and so
excited because I I'm collaborating away
it's docile and they sent me a tungsten
suit and I'll have a few other Rams
thrown in there and so I just want to
show you guys and let's just get started
so this first one is probably one of my
favorites it's this scalloped one piece
it's pretty like scalloped detailing
just it's just a really pretty like red
and it also has a quilted feel it feels
so good and it's super comfortable and I
probably will be wearing this so much
during summer so this next one is a
super cool white one and it has
horizontal black light stripes and this
one's so pretty and I love this big
stress people problem meatball straps
you know spaghetti straps me about
stress I love this one and it's super
comfy and this has a ray coolant gold
zipper and I can zip up and down but
keep it up yeah this is super cute and
comfy the next one is I love the print
on this one is a tsunami I love clients
and so this one I had to get it it's
like banana leaf palm leaf in far just
like drawing on the compute it is so
pretty and I just think it's adorable
this spaghetti strasser
they're like Finn's dress but they have
like this little cool blue and it just
adds to it super fun try not to say cute
because that's like the only thing that
comes to mind whenever I'm talking about
these the next one is Lois Lincoln
material ever that even though they made
some seeds out of this but I was just so
soft and like who would've thought that
a bathing suit would be soft it's so
cool and this one has just a kind of
just like a scooped v-neck and in the
back of a cross and this one has a
little hole in the box and it's very
interesting it's not your usual this is
icy it's also is really pretty burnt
orange which i think is like it's cool
it's different from like the regular
bright colors of today see the next one
is the aquatic Baywatch this one way it
was unless we had to get our so far when
they had in stock this is Baywatch
because if you guys don't get the joke
it's like when your lifeguard you're on
Baywatch be a
why watch so making sure like
johnsjourneys but there is a Bay like
boyfriend watch oh yeah so I goes on
it's a low back a high neck and it's so
comfy this one is one of the really
soccer material and it's pretty high
quality so don't even worry about that
next one is not going to but it is it's
not a towel but it's not a blanket it's
like a beach blanket it's super good for
just like when you're laying laying it
out on a sandy beach like it won't like
scale growth and the next thing too is
not some gospel this one is from Albine
fit and I love a Labine fit they have
all like their symptoms are so high
quality it's like ridiculous and so this
one I posted like what last year but I
still have it it's my probably my
favorite sub to the last one is I'm
wearing it right now but it's just like
hi this is the sixth grade but it's very
high quality
it's from justice and is a black pinky
knee and it has little cute white titles
all over it with like neon green straps
I love it and it's super comfy is our
neighbors have dogs I'll have the link
down below for all the symptoms if you
guys want to go check them out alright
it is so right and thank you guys for
watching this video I hope you all got
some info for your 2017 Spring Break

get tan but you know to the word really
