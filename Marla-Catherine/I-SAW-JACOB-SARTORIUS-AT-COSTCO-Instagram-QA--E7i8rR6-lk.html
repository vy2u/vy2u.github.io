here with another video for you guys um
so so today's video is going to be a
Instagram Q&amp;amp;A I I see you guys a little
bit ago to ask me questions for an
upcoming instrum community and so now
I'm answering your questions anyway so
thank you guys everyone that commentate
obviously I'm not gonna be able to get
time all them but you know maybe next
time stage Stuart asked where is my
dress from this one right here um Oh
like a time you guys asked all the time
like where's your where's your clothes
from work I'm going to be honest with
you
half of my feet are very closed for
footing my clothes are actually from a
thrift store and I think there's nothing
wrong with that and recycling clothes
that other people just didn't have any
for anymore so here's the shop with
their stories don't be ashamed
honestly like I think it's so cool and
kudos to you Whitney and the twelve
asked are you excited to go after school
and honestly no because I feel I could
get really excited with the first day in
the second day and after that I realized
that I got myself into even though I had
no choice to go to school my parents
forced interesting I'm very grateful for
an education errand a'queen ask if you
have any sisters with any famous
youtuber who would it be and not
including any numbers or anything actors
honestly I think Rick will be sisters
with our CEO Beauty cuz to be in her
videos like that would be so cool like
dressing up like a princess and then
like you know like princess carpool ride
like that he's so fun Annelise Walker
asked what do you think about the haters
layoffs
Ava dancer one-two-three-four asked what
is your favorite type of video to film
my favorite types of videos to film is
honestly a kid I don't really care what
the video is as long as my environment
is like light and there's a lot of
natural light and I'm just in a good
mood I always enjoy going when I'm like
that but my favorite videos to film are
probably the ones where I get to like go
to a school or something because it's
kind of fun to adventure because I don't
get out that much honestly if you guys
if you guys realize I don't take that
many photos with people because there's
no friends actually Emily greedy asked
how many times have you dyed your hair
everyone buckle up
and so total is I've dyed my hair 8
times that's a lot especially for my age
but I have a lot of time to grow it out
anyway the strength of my hair is
actually pretty good considering how
many times I bleached it and I've dyed
it and I've done all that Giles but I
use olaplex and that's like like it
protects your hair from the bleach and
my hair is actually pretty strong
considering what I've done to it its
care would asked what is your favorite
song it um and it used to be gooey but
the Gilligan monster mix by gloss
animals but I listened to that too many
times and now it's not my favorite song
a scarran would also asked what is your
dream job and it's YouTube honestly it
would be so much fun like you just gotta
have fun as your job like oh my if you
guys can make that happen
thank you so much please it's Annius
safest a state but I play coffee Pokemon
Pokemon go no I do not I mmm-hmm and
this in person assets I'm Sonya and she
adds to Jacob satorious or Dylan O'Brien
is that a question um Dylan O'Brien all
the way I follow so many fan pages for
him on my personal account Lindsay asked
what is your number one tip for people
that want to start a YouTube channel and
honestly it's to be yourself or if you
can't do that I sometimes have a hard
time doing if you can do that then at
least I'm good whining I would actually
try to like film during the day when
there's natural light and like set it up
so the windows like facing you and then
you all that natural light it just makes
the video feel a lot better
Savannah asked show us your 13th photo
on your camera roll no okay so the 13
foot on my camera roll so the story
behind that photo is so to sum up any
sort of long story I was at Costco and I
was texting my friend Oliver and I look
up and I like genuinely thought I was
Jacob satorious I just so you guys know
you probably think I'm like obsessed his
name I promise I'm not I just think it's
he's almost like funny of how much he
gets anyway so I stopped I saw him and
so I was like oh my gosh Jacob satorious
is at Costco and then
he's like take a picture and I was like
I'm not gonna like randomly like go up
to someone take a picture but he's like
do the phone trick and I remembered you
go like this pretender on the phone but
you're really on camera and then you hit
the plus button like the turnout volume
and it takes a picture so I did that and
he was literally right there and then
right when he turned around I took the
picture and so that's the only good one
I'd like even got of him but so it was
not cheap to Turia's but he looks so
close to him like oh my gosh is kind of
weird Haley's family asked where's they
Martha come from my parents they love
the older names the more of the classics
so like my sister's name is Evelyn and
my brother's name is Nathaniel my
brother's name Samuel thank you guys for
