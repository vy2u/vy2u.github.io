we're going to be doing a life update
recently a lot of big changes have been
going on in my life and I just have to
share them with you guys so first up I
got a new camera it is the canon eos 70d
and we upgraded from the canon t3i and
both of them are great cameras but
obviously that u.s. 7d is a lot better
so if you guys recognize a grandma crop
camera crawl it if you guys recognize a
camera quality difference well that's
her to say give it a thumbs up now the
second thing that's have been going on
is I'm moving so exciting I um we are
moving and so obviously life has been so
crazy so I'm very sorry for the kind of
oddest video schedule post and for
missing some weeks and but we'll get
more consistent once I've settled into
the actual house and also I'm living in
my aunt's basement and that's like why
there's like you know laundry hamper
some boxes be expecting a lot more
videos that involve a bedroom same
things you know and if you guys want a
bedroom a tour then comment that down
below and the next thing is that what
was the next thing and the next thing is
that I'm switching to online school I'm
switching from public school to online
school and yes this is so like random
but I've been wanting to do it since
like the fifth grade and it kind of just
finally worked out and like my mom like
trusted me enough to you know be self
driven and able to get things done I'm
so excited for that that is way exciting
and then the last I started you for
channel I wanted you guys to be able to
experience my my experience of moving
and just life in general and so I
started a blog channel I've been very
bad about vlogging and I'm sorry about
that but I'll get better and so we'll
have a link down to that in the downbar
