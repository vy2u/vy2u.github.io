that you guys always asked about and
it's behind the scenes my boyish crack
that's embarrassing you guys are always
asking about my Instagram photos and how
we take them when I say we my sister and
I we take a pose together
this is my Instagram account of the day
let me go to the mirror you guys seem to
love these type of videos and that's
when filming them and I honestly love
vlog style videos they're one of my
favorite videos of films Jesus for my
makeup I am just doing my accentuated
everyday makeup routine
I just like to keep my makeup and
Manuscript was pretty natural excited
what I want anyone to ever meet me in
real life and be like whoa you're not
the same person so I'm wearing this
collared shirt Amanda do you know where
this is from this was purchased
literally so long ago but it's actually
my little sister's and she didn't want
it anymore so I came up and I grabbed it
I snatched it and it's so cute it has
one of those Peter Pan collars and then
it's just some cherries and then I have
my jeans from brandy melville that I
love and wear all the time and then I
switched up I was gonna wear
Birkenstocks and I was like you know I'm
gonna switch it up so I'm wearing these
shoes you're married I'm wearing new
shoes from ASOS and they're slightly
platform
now we're on a journey we're on a quest
and we're gonna try to find it
we ended up talking to the girl that did
the sunflower field and we got an
address for that so we're gonna try and
attempt to go there but we're here at
this location it's literally just like a
corner of a house but we're gonna make
it work
so like I like it we had some talks
balding I think we got the goods I think
we got the shot and also I put on some
makeup I think I busted my wenis okay
guys look at the dog we've been hiking
for a couple of hours just came for like
five minutes but he literally could
still die okay change into the dress
that I brought can we go get an expresso
for this okay now I changed into the
dress that I'm shooting it I wore this
dress that one of my meet and greet it
looks a little muddy I'm here these
flowers and they're really pretty took
us over colder for what is up everyone
eat we finished that okay so okay so I
am not vlogging because we are no
independent the line is even back
oh are you the line is wrapping around
the story should we just go in no no
everyone we're gonna go dependent trust
even though the whiteness of wrapping
around the store I know that go I hate I
want to see people I know in public so
I'm like this is how I have good school
I don't actually photos with my face
hello everyone is actually the next day
and I am continuing this vai behind okay
I've actually continue I'm actually
continuing my behind-the-scenes photo
shoot vlog we're doing another photo
shoot today at the field that we tried
to take a photo shoot at yesterday so I
this is my outfit I've actually won this
outfit in an Instagram photo I only
posted it one time though that photo and
so like I feel like it doesn't do the
outfit justice because I really love
this dress but dress and the top are
both from princess Polly and then I'm
wearing converse because we are gonna be
doing like a small little walk through
the mountains and so I want to make sure
wearing a platform shoes like it was
yesterday
so I'm also gonna be putting in hair
extensions today just to spice things up
my hair is very long it but it is now
done and I actually think it's so cute
it's more of an Instagram hairstyle
because it does not look good from the
back okay we are now here I hope I don't
get eaten by anything and there's a baby
bees actually like they're cute they
are the ones that give us flowers but
you're scary man that's a steep hill
there you go right here
okay guys so we just finished up at the
Mart I said hey guys it's not like I
disappeared or anything we finished up
at the shoot for the Wildflower I'm
really glad I did the extensions I feel
like it just adds an extra touch to the
photos I normally don't have and now
we're gonna go get some ice cream not on
any model buy it
I actually can take my permit test in 11
days
guys it's May first I turned 15 on the
11th so I love you guys a lot and I'm
just grateful I'm sorry if this video
was extremely longer but you guys asked
for a lot and I love doing these types
of videos um so I'm not gonna answer too
many questions about the whole editing
process of the photos we also want to
make an upcoming like separate video
about that excessive hold another topic
I can get into but this was kind of just
the behind the scenes of actually taking
the photos and the struggles of not
finding the flower fields the first
couple of tries you look I love doing
Instagram photos there's definitely I'm
not gonna lie Instagram just kind of one
big lie like it makes it look like so
glamorous and easy when in reality like
we don't have fun but it is like a lot
more effort than you think goes into
that one photo I hope you guys enjoyed
this walk if you did it then give it a
thumbs up that's about it for today's
video if you guys liked it you already
know what to do you already know where
the thumbs-up button is you already know
where that subscribe button is so also

love finding an inspiration also this is
a new sweater this is well this is a new
hoodie that I bought for myself for my
birthday and may or may not have bought
a few other items too so if you guys
want to go ahead and give this video a
thumbs up and let me know that you guys
