it is Saturday today and hold on I just
it's a great day okay so this like the
only decoration we have in here and then
my brother like mm-hmm so I'm currently
getting ready for the photo shoot and my
backup is already pretty much done I
might make it a little bit more intense
right before people leave that way it
shows it better a camera but right now
I'm crimping my hair with a
straightening iron so it's lots of fun
partying up in the club and my brother's
watching Stuart do things so basically
listening to the audio right now of that
that's what I'm doing so okay I can you
apologize since we don't have an actual
crimper I just you just straighten a
yarn and it just makes your girl look
more voluminous like that has texture
anyway so what hair is it now done we're
I'm gonna go get dressed we're probably
gonna film the video before we go on the
shoot though we're probably gonna go
from the fall favorites and then we will
see you guys have a shoot so we are
currently at this like Jeremih because
they have a cute quarter so we're taking
photos there and let me quickly do my
outfit of the day so so sucks up my
shirt is their student so are my pants
and then my shoes your converse that was
really easy so how are you find our
locations you normally like just drive
around if we see something that we think
could work them try it but it's
literally just so because they normally
have these like really cool at least the
tennis courts in Utah have a a lot of
them have like the super cool green and
white kiss oh no oh you just scratched
me she just scratched me beer me no I'm
good no I'm vlogging on my phone right
now because there's almost no space on
so but a lot of you guys always ask like
how do you want your locations and
honestly it's just it's kind of just you
drive around and you try to find them
there's so many little places that no
one really knows about but when you
drive around you look for them you can
find them so I just feel like it you
honestly just don't explore so with that
being said we now finished up the shoot
so we normally like to go out to eat
after we shoot I don't like to eat
before I shoot because I always feel
bloated and then I don't like to be in
the photos even though like I look the
same we're now gonna go out to eat
because it's actually almost four
o'clock and I've only eaten breakfast
and like a banana find the perfect
outfit slash location when you're
fighting the perfect location is also
searching up like I need other
photographers are that are like kind of
here in your area and then you can like
dam them google searching locations a
lot of the time that works and then also
exploring yourself and just trying to
find like those cute undiscovered places
if you can't drive like just walk like a
lot of the time like your neighborhood
can have some cool places you don't so
it's like do you guys ever play any
music when you guys do a photo shoot
just so you can get inspired with the
music and like with dance moves and
poses of all music is playing there's
actually like a good idea no no no we
don't but we do listen to music like in
the car before the photo shoot when I
get all pumped how do you become that
confident from the camera I think it's
honestly just practice if you go watch
my first video on YouTube versus I like
this video
like my first video I looked like
someone was like holding me to the death
like if I did like yeah they might
holding me for ransom and like now the
way I'm acting on camera right now is
the way I act off camera so if
everyone's wondering why my head's a lot
bigger than my eyes I don't know why
what can I do to take Instagram close
with close the time it's our DSLR
sometimes if we're like sometimes we
have taken photos with the iPhone
let's rip model buy it talk about what
filters do you use so everyone has that
question you know we use the JC Murray
filters I'll link up a car if I take a
thousand photos I think we only get like
a total like five of them probably like
that oh we can even post and then even
out of those five we only post like one
or two so it's kind of actually the
precedent think about it
Thank You Maura call this time and like
mix one photo so how do you edit your
photos Jason green filters something I
wanted to say quickly about that is that
you can slop like any filter on any
photo but it really depends on how you
shoot the photo because like you want
your raw photo is City good I guess
that's I'm trying to say otherwise when
you go put your filter on just gonna be
a lot more work and like editing you're
gonna have to do for your sister how do
you make your models comfort about their
poses and things well I don't know
honestly it's like from the beginning
you kind of suck it kind of like the
best now but you're like better than you
were as a photographer it is hard though
to sometimes like post people because
especially if they don't know what
they're doing and then you guys are
joking no where do you get your ideas
holy cow I just like I'm dying and then
you just don't even care breathing I
need shoes all before photo shoots
that's a good question we literally just
like grab whatever I think that's why
you're like style so weird kids like we
just grab whatever gotcha to really grab
that outfit like I just try not to
overthink it grab whatever I want to
like humans before she actually happens
and then they always like with photos
like the weirder like the better your
outfit is it's gonna like show it better
on camera so shoe as much as you can
shoe as much as you can because practice
makes perfect and if you were to see the
photos I took of people all insert them
like right here if I can find any of
them like
so bad I started choking when I was
trying to tell you guys but you're off
it also depends on what look you're
going for but back to like up co-drivers
I say she as much as you can trying to
find your style you will find your style
eventually just change it up I think
buying like new equipment always is like
rien spiring
to like getting different lenses and I
go into seminars I think they sound like
they're gonna be boring and they ought
to be like super cool yeah I think I
mean if you can't physically go to one
there's so many on like on online or
just on YouTube like the tutorials just
a Coco Basie she's really good I feel
like also a lot of our go-to places or
places are close by her house so we
don't want like saying look camera would
you recommend for beginner photographer
73 t3 eyes are really good when I'm sure
it's like super cheap now because now I
think there's like a Canon - seven or t6
so super eyes good though because the
Canon 50mm it was my first lens outside
of like the kit lens they usually got
and I loved it from some of the photos
and I got from that look similar to this
and this was a $600 lens so get the
nifty 50 if you're like not sure it
started to get it really is comfortable
posing honestly sometimes you're not I
get mad sometimes because I'm like we
literally got dressed up drove all the
way here and then you're like not even
posing because it's cuz if I'm in public
some days I just cared somebody they
don't like I feel like which is not a
good thing because I like you should
always just be like cooperative I feel
like the more you so many people on
Instagram pose and like this is their
job and so when someone in public is
watching you do it if anything it's
gonna be cool it's like oh look at most
people probably just be like oh that's
cool or like most people don't
comment and if they do it's usually like
this just so people are so used to it
now
I saw someone like being like shot like
someone taking pictures and like I
thought about for two seconds and then
like you know moved on to other laughter
you to edit your photos white room on
the computer is what I use most the time
how do you get your picture ideas just
tumblr other you know oh they're like I
think my voice is sold and easily
because I just got over strep throat
what do you do when if you're trying to
good fun or super windy I'd say he's a
to advantage yeah yeah in fact we were
on top of the building shooting with
Canyon like the other day and it was
super windy and like it's not this
picture yeah he just had like Mauro move
her head around and I ended up being
really cool cousin you have like so
wizard that's not all the questions we
can answer because now we have to go get
some no we are not doing no actual
diamonds it's right over there we're
going No
the many good flavors what a ripoff you
know hey man that's like good okay got
to go
looks like it
I think that wraps up today's video so
then you guys so much for watching if
you enjoyed it give it a thumbs up hope
the answers for your questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
