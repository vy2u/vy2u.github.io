hey guys is Marla and today's video is
going to be a QA and super shy to do
this because I think you days are fun
and can I get to know what get to know
each other better kind of bill I asked
you guys on Instagram to ask you
questions and I was yesterday so I'm
having about an MPI on dolls get this
party to end so if you did not ask me
question is because you don't follow me
in its grand and Di's a crime so my
first question that is public like so
asked is are you a model and first off
do I want one point like first second
off my mom answer like I did the garage
shoot campaign or whatever and I was
like a ton of fun but your site it kind
of give you a glimpse into gave myself a
good glimpse into the modeling world but
I don't think I would like to do that
I've never thought of myself as a model
and so when you guys ask me I'm like so
no I'm not a model but I you like it's
really it's M intense so we want to be
when you're older I want to be that is
crooked
you could get it's so crooked no it's
not
so what I want to be when I grow up
is there a YouTube license oh cool okay
so obviously I do want to commit you to
work I already am youtuber because I
want to be youtuber I plan on doing it
until I you guys can think of me I don't
want to like run my own clothing store
or my own clothing company and I design
clothes because I love to do that I
think it's so much fun as I go just be
like a good thing to do so a lot of you
guys have been asking me why and going
back to public school and you can also
ask me like do like almost a letter a
public school so I think the fact I'm
going back to public school tells you
guys that I do it public school better
than online I learned that with my
attendant personality or whatever like I
just do better in like
environment where text set for learning
so join my hobby of my education and my
living all just in the same place and so
it was getting a little much for me and
I just I don't think I was also getting
the best education through monocle but
that's probably my fault because I
wasn't like putting my all into it my
Spotify playlist grew so much when I did
online tool because that's all I did
and I visually behind pool was a little
too relaxed for me and I got a little
much within so so a lot of you guys have
been asking my coaches and executives
kids that I have had a crush on since
the fourth grade and his name is so a
lot of you guys are confused to who
edits my videos and like why I don't do
it myself and quite like that whole
situation so basically my sister Evelyn
- she does the other half of the YouTube
so she's the other half but behind the
scenes the stage crew whatever you guys
wanna color she's awesome when alone
when my sister we work well together by
doing that she does what she enjoys and
I do what I enjoy it which works
together well if you guys didn't know
that she had it's them that you like all
I got what she doesn't come onto camera
with me and the reason why is because
she actually another very greatly asked
question is what grade I'm going into in
a sixty ninth grade which is low stupid
here in Utah because we don't go to we
don't go to high school when angry we
stay in the pool and angry so I'm still
talking to your high and who came up
with an idea for turning creamsicle 70
so you guys have been asking me like are
you nervous about to public school
because you're so famous is so cool on
no no anyway like I'll just get these
like waves of like okay like I don't
want to go back you know like I argue
like everyone kind of gets those
whenever they go back to school but I
feel like I know I just feel like I am
nervous and so faster you guys this
question is guys as the board so to
answer your guys is a question I am
nervous go back to school but I think
everything will turn out fine and I will
send it for myself I thought I need to
description and run what is your
religion or are you Mormon and so yes I
am Mormon I'm proud of it like no like
really like I enjoy being Mormon so
we're all guys if you guys do want to
know more about my religion and what I
believe in then you can you guys can go
visit Mormon dog board why do I enjoy
store shopping so much so this is almost
like an ironic question because I stated
through shopping like their shopping was
like it was broke
like and I think the reason why I hate
it so much was because I know just the
fact that someone else owned it before
me or the fact that it wasn't new kind
of like grossed me out which I don't
really get now because I'm like someone
owned it and had story and then now it's
your turn to have it and make your own
story in it and so cap you guys also
asked me how tall I am all the time with
this kind of money because isn't it
every single description boxes every
video but I'm five foot seven back to
school advice and you know I know just
be nice to everyone
literally especially like the boys be
nice to the boys because you never know
we could grow up you never know
I'm middle school and so I know
everything what am I getting my braces
off my orthodontist says you never know
like things could change but he says
that I could have possibly be getting
them off between a gent
like between like around December
January time which is absolutely super
soon and so it's through cara cara cara
another question that I also bought a
ton was what is one of my most
embarrassing moments I've ever happened
to be going to keep of pretty general
because I don't want anyone to figure
out this one I've done this place and I
was with one of my friends and she we
were talking about this like really cute
guy and he was like kind of like
neutrally in the same area as us so I'm
really talking about him and then she
was like you know I'm going to say hi to
him and I was like no I was like don't
do that I was like that's right - no and
she was like you know I am and so I was
like thought she was joking around and
we had walked past and we walked past
him and he's like right here where I
walking and then she says I then started
talking him and my reaction tonight my
reaction to this situation was to run
and not just run but run as fast as I
could so I bolted as fast as I could
that soon as I saw that she had said hi
and I was just like died and it was like
that and I ran as fast as I could for as
long as I could until they're out of
sight in this minute but now looking
back on like what how dumb I was I think
it would even more embarrassing that I
just didn't stand there and like wait
and let them talk and should it be
bolting at once I couldn't and my friend
was yelling after me like Laura Thielen
comeback as I was running
it was a really amazing you guys also
asked if I always liked like the way I
act on camera is like it's a way I acted
realized and I ever say I know the way I
act on camera is the way I act and
realize like I do like to keep it pretty
like the same like I don't like her out
first people watch my first youtube
videos those were a little crazy in a
little stage but like I feel like now I
just gotten comfortable in front of the
camera and so like I just act meat like
this is just me I know I not roasted
this Q&amp;amp;A it was little it was a little
weird maybe hard to be doing ask
questions I will a man's family Dubble
Oh guys my go follow it that way you can
ask a question for next time Q&amp;amp;A and
after that a I hope you got to know me a
little bit better and I'll see you guys
in the next video bye oh no don't go to
it I have to go away going on currently
