I oughta call these the Keene was the
Keene was of it so the kind of stuff
like you Nate hey guys so I actually do
a quinoa annex I stay modest this is a
literally such a short dress but it's so
cute so I just relating with it hey guys
are going to build up the blush the bill
ish hey guys Susan Orlean hey alright so
today I used to do a quinoa that's why
I'm just gonna call in QA hey guys hey
guys welcome back to my channel so today
we're doing a quinoa if you're new here
I just really decided that's what I'm
gonna call me cue neighs cuz it sounds
like quinoa Q&amp;amp;A and quinoa makes sense
so today we do quinoa and I asked you
guys on Instagram to ask me questions so
how do I handle boys and hate and stuff
I don't you know when you start a
YouTube channel you're kind of like
putting yourself out there and so you're
kind of just prone to getting hey like
hate comments are kind of like a package
with YouTube so be prepared if you were
gonna start YouTube channel my best
advice for anyone that can take homes
online is to simply delete them and
block them if I was a hater and I was
comforting hate things awesome good
persons page what I would want is for
that person respond to me and then I
would feel accomplished even though that
is not an accomplishment in any way
shape or form but by deleting them they
don't win I don't know I'm not even in
high school mmm I'm sorry but I don't
have any advice for you because I'm
going into high school myself and I'm
very nervous I die you guys can have my
youtube channel one of you it will be a
giveaway of my mom will host it a lot of
the time you guys asked about my hair it
honestly is literally just a very
overgrown balayage from like a long time
ago I think I was the cutest at 12
I've degraded it's gone downhill the
last photo on my phone is oh it's this
my sister and I were kind of roasting
those people that like do stories or
like snapchat stories or Instagram
stories but they literally have a filter
on and then you could like like I know
I've seen it so annoying like you don't
even need a filter yours talking so I
was trying to recreate it this isn't
people at school treat me differently
because of youtube um I start my youtube
channel in the 7
great and I feel like I went into
seventh grade and it like for the first
off of the year no one even knew I did
your channel it was so small and then
when it started gaining popularity I
feel like people would ask me about it
almost every single day I kind of would
get overwhelmed because I'm like what's
the big deal because everyone hits an
Instagram account everyone has a
snapchat or whatever so what why is it
any different that I post on YouTube
it's just another platform and so when
everyone was like freaking out about it
we're like just I don't know being rude
about it I just would like why I feel
like in general people now don't really
treat me differently because I'm they're
kind of used to it and they're kids that
I've gone to school with for a long time
and so it's not like I have all the
sudden like I'm all of a sudden the new
kid that has a YouTube channel is just
more like oh yeah Marlon now does how
you did you they knew me before it and
so you know they pretty much treat me
the same there's always gonna be a few
kids that are rude about it or kind of
weird about it how come why I'm
literally like five six and a half
uh-huh the next most asked question is
how do i addit my Instagram photos I
don't know that that my sister does if
you guys don't know but literally if you
guys don't know literally my this
YouTube channel and while Kathryn is me
and I'm in front of it but my sisters
the other half she was the one that had
the idea to start the channel and a lot
of you guys don't know that and it's not
because I don't have everyone on the
challenge that she doesn't want to be
she literally she's not even ugly holy
crap she's not but she edits everything
and yeah we do it too and they're like
24/7 but we will have a whatever I say
we I'm talking about my sister and I am
just basically we will have a how we add
our inscribed photos video going up soon
because you guys asked that all the time
yeah so stay tuned for that
my favorite earlobe is definitely what
my loved ones do I stand firm wall
pardon I love him I'm not allowed to
date until I'm 16 so I don't know I
don't I don't I'm not a player girl like
that you know - no I have not had my
first kiss
wait wait just like kindergarten count

kindergarten yet I think I kissed
someone for a piece of gum okay they
were like I'll give you a piece of gum
if you kiss this boy and so like this
ugly this like other weird kid in the
kindergarten class that doesn't even
count I wasn't even in current
kindergarten it was like this kid that
was in my neighborhood that doesn't
count though so no I have no I had my
first kiss some of you guys asked do I
get hate for my religion I'm a Mormon
if you guys did not know or the name
my official name of my church is the
Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day
saints but most of you guys know it's by
either LDS or Mormon because in my
Instagram bio I have like at the LDS
Church like the few times I have Vaughn
hate online about my religion is when I
will post about it like directly like I
once I mean an Instagram post kind of
talking about it and I got a few hate
comps and they're saying it's a cult or
it's a really bad religion everyone's
rude or just really like absurd things
that are so not true basically if you
guys don't know what Mormon is Lauren's
are we're just overall go to Christian
people and we're all trying our best to
get back to heaven honestly no reason to
hate on us we love everyone and we as we
believe that everyone is equal in the
sight of God and so yeah I love being
Mormon I actually do like I really love
being warm and I feel like it has made
my life so much better if you guys are
