sponsoring them today you using my
ukulele to prop up the box light I
cannot get this sticker removed I'm
really annoyed hey guys so today we're
gonna be doing Instagram Q&amp;amp;A I haven't
done one in four months and things have
changed
so today's video is brought to you guys
by Squarespace so whether you guys want
to make an online store a website or
domain make it with Squarespace FedEx
truck if you guys head on over to
Squarespace at.com slash more like a
three you guys can get 10% off your
first purchase of a website or a domain
I'll be talking about Squarespace at the
end of this video but let's get on into
his Q&amp;amp;A so first question is what made
to my channel start to grow honestly
posting a lot putting yourself out there
I would go and I would fight channels
without like a similar I'm out
subscribers and then I would see what
video went viral for them and then I
would do like my own twist on that video
some of them work some of them didn't
but it's honestly just like a trial and
error so finding what's gonna go viral
for you and then making that work so how
many siblings do I have there's five
kids in my family I am the fourth to the
youngest on this second Palast
yeah we have five people five kids my
family and my mom and dad and yeah we're
just one big happy family my new year's
resolutions to get fit yes we'll get
more into like a healthy have like a
healthy lifestyle to hit a million
subscribers yeah right five to live in
another state besides Utah I'd probably
want to live and I'd want to live where
they're somewhere warm so probably
California not like LA but more more
like south of LA cuz you get like the
warm factor but you don't have to deal
with like all like traffic and stuff you
know so I probably was in California I
think would actually be so much fun to
live in New York for like a summer or
something that would be so much fun how
many instruments do I play cuz you guys
I think I'm a musical genius what I'm
not I put the violin for two years so I
still like know how to play it but I'm
not the best I don't ask me to play a
few guys I actually played a clip of me
playing in my blog channel so that was
really funny yeah and then it's talked
about the violin i played the ukulele
which i feel like I'm pretty good at
like I feel like I've legally down um
I've been playing the piano since I was
like 6 how many years is that six
fourteen subtract six equals eight and I
also just barely got a guitar like two
days ago so I know how to play a few
songs in the guitar already but I'm not
definitely not a master am I gonna come
out with March so I'm actually currently
working on something like that right now
and I'm so I've never been more excited
to like work with a company like this
like I'm so excited
there was a sneak peak of what I'm
thinking of doing all my blog channels
so if you if you're not subscribed my
blog Sean you're missing out on so much
I'll have a link to my love channel down
below into the vlog where I talk about
my March more I don't know I really I
think there's gonna be like a sweatshirt
in there to like at one of those
crewneck sweatshirts because those I
love those so much and I think they're
really cute merch is going to be in my
near future so stay tuned for that when
am I going to upload a cover slash
sustaining video that's hard because I
feel like I want to not rush doing that
I want to like make it like something
I'm super proud of I'm going to have one
on my channel it's just marking matter
of me doing it and I don't know why but
I'm feel like I'm more afraid to post on
my youtube channel about me scene then
like I am about Instagram because I've
posted like lots of clips of me seen in
my Instagram story and you guys have
always been nice so I don't know if you
guys are just lying or what how did I
get to model for brandy melville I'm
asking myself the same question - I
don't even know how that happened okay
well I know how it happened but like I
don't know what happened anyway but I
was trying to fall asleep was like 11
o'clock at night my sister ran up the
stairs she like Sam's open to the door
and she's like Marla and I was like what
and she was like guess who deemed you
brandy melville and I like start crying
I was just I don't know I was it was
late at night I was emotional they just
basically deemed us and then we got in
contact with their email and then they
we shot with them and it was awesome it
was honestly such a good experience I
was expecting myself to be super nervous
but I wasn't that nervous it was just
super casual it was lots of fun
and every all the workers that I met
were super nice in the photographer Lily
she was so nice what's her favorite
memory from 2017 I it's not that I just
don't live a fun life I just don't like
there's no fan turns out this past year
was our first year living in a house
with a backyard which was super fun and
it's just such like I feel super blessed
but anyway so we set up a pool in the
backyard and it was like an 18 foot pool
so it was like big at least for us you
know and we I just remember like
swimming and it was just fun to like be
able to go into the backyard and go
swimming and just like be in our own
space so in July I went to Montreal
Canada Quebec Quebec I don't know if I
say that right I went on my plane for
the first time in July and honestly that
was so like so much fun like the lady in
front of us started crying because
there's some bad turbulence but I didn't
know what was going on I thought it was
just part of the plane so I was like
this is fluffy
okay some of my others
Liberty crushes besides the Dylan infant
Oh China Tatum
we watched she's the man last night and
that was like fun because Ellen I just
watched it and it was a cute chick flick

popping personality so what should I do
