into you at my channel and if you new
here go subscribe today's video is going
to be a little bit different I had done
any favourites videos and so I'm trying
them out thank you guys less than but it
is going to be my January favourites and
I am just showing you guys my favorites
of the month and I use this stuff all
the time and they became part of my
daily routine and so I wanna show you
guys and let's get into the video
Oh so start off I have this this is the
tester version because the cumin my
mom's if you guys it I don't know how to
pronounce it but I'll have like a
picture it's the O thermal Isaac if I
confront big boys thermal spring water
and it just seemed soothes your skin and
it's for sensitive skin and Grover for
your makeup or after and it may feel
silly and I loved it and I used it every
single day so it's all gone and I'm
really not about it so the next beauty
product is the agenda lines lip next
beauty product is the genuine that blush
side benefit and I loved how and
natural-looking this lips I'm going to
use this almost every day and it smells
good I'm know if it's photo swims I
think it smell good and is look $15
version the smaller version because and
I buy these first up they're cheaper
kicking off fill up see a while but if
Daniel I watch is so pretty and like it
looks really good against my skin tone
see next make a product is this Ecotools
large powder brush and this is my
favorite brush that I got for Christmas
and I use this everyday it is so soft so
fluffy and it's probably too serious my
most favorite blush I've ever had
nowhere least though the next big beauty
product is this twisted peppermint
lotion from that Bath and Body Works and
I've been using it every time I get out
of the shower and it's just there's
something about it that makes your skin
like feel Mellon minty and my fresh and
I love the smell of peppermint now in
the last bead apart is its powerful I
don't know how to categorize because
guess what this in the beauty but I have
been wearing headbands like almost every
day whenever my hair's daddy which is
most days I was just I want to hide that
my era when I thought Robert anyone's
liked my book and I loved it so much and
I actually wanted to Copco in times of
my bangs were freaking out and like a
three-year-old little girl start
pointing at I mean take a look at me for
Oh the first product is this watercolor
I'm showing you one of multiple
watercolor paints I got and I've been
loving watercolor lately more than
acrylic because I just love painting
with it more than acrylic normally
another but I think it's fun to do and
work with my favorites and at the last
art product is these Prisma colors I
think Prisma colors are awesome
so I Laura phi2 Crayola consoles and
they're just a lot smoother and they're
easier to blend and I love them and I
love coloring in those like adult
coloring books with these and is this is
the 24 pack and I got from an Oregon
somebody can get anything everywhere so
so the first shop of my January
favorites is the Urban Outfitters and I
shop there for the first time this month
and it was such an awesome experience it
was online shopping the return process
was so easy and that was awesome and
also all the products that came I love
and I thought they're excellent quality
look so my room decor that you guys
didn't see is from Urban Outfitters and
my next favorite store and last one was
a hungies oh I love getting all my
plants in there so I got my I got my
palm leaf plant from there and a lot of
the plants you guys are seeing my rent
or I just love my cheap here and I love
plants so I love lamp
oh the next category is my food favorite
is only two because so foursomes
applesauce and i ate apple sauce number
of hungry and applesauce is awesome and
the next one is I agreed to discover I
found in January and we were at Costco
and they are sampling these and after
freaking out because I ate probably the
whole dark art example as be tardy Old
Dominion at peanut company at the burnt
sugar Cooper and sugar cookie calms calm
collected
time sugar pecans I'm secure in China
these are awesome they taste so good and
if I'm just need a good sense it smells
so lit like I can maybe make a candle
out of sugar pecan because this is real
good so basically my entire month of
January where all my January favorites
and so you need to go follow me and
check out the songs and I'll call these
cakes my one favorite I just have to
share with you right so so the name of
this song is catch me outside a truck
remixed want more that followed my
Spotify underscore monitor the last
category is my random I didn't know what
to cover I sneeze out so I just put them
into like the big bowl of adamant so the
first one is my favorite youtuber this
month I get recently discovered was
common grey and his channel mmm it is
good I love fun a great he's just so
relaxing to watch and his videos are so
tumblr and they like I literally watched
all his videos I'll have a channel

so da last product in the category of
randomness is the 19th of a few hot and
basically representing all half in
general I loved wearing past and
headbands this month and this is super
soft and it's from a clown and anyway so
yeah so that wraps up all of my January
favorites and they were kind of laying
