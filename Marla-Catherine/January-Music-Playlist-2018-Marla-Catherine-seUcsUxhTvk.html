YouTube comes first right
hey guys it's Marla and today we're very
filming a music favorites video you guys
are posting to all the time and the
lighting is going down so I'm not gonna
make this long but I just I have to say
one thing I made this shirt so just
there's gonna be different colors in
this shirt anyway this year will come in
different colors and darker colors out
you can see the logo more but it's I
think it's super cute I design it myself
I literally can't drew it and then send
it over and they put on a shirt send me
a picture if you guys do order it and
you send me a picture of you wearing it
probably post on my insta story we can
be twins all that good stuff by the way
this is a pretty short campaign so you
have to either get it now or never just
saying I'll have more information about
my shirts in the description box so
let's get started
so this first song is called weight by
maroon 5 and normally I don't like very
mainstream music but this one has a
really cool were mixes with the Chromeo
remix anyway let's listen that one is
really good definitely listen to it my
next new favorite song is closer by
powers and I just think this is such
like a summery song even though it's
January like it has such summer vibes to
me I really like this one
by the way cringy disclaimer I used this
in one of my lips lips so
the only words I know in the song okay
this next one I used to my makeup store
and you guys were obsessing over the
song they literally love this one so
much so this is the part of Iceland like
this I watched my own youtube videos all
the time you guys like my new cake this
one is so good in the car like the face
on it I was on Spotify and I was just
like looking for new songs and I found
this guy on Spotify he's like six
thousand listeners listeners anyway so
he's not very big but like he has really
good music so 11 out of 10 or command
wait watch it
so I found this guy through my sister
which found this song which is this one
I listen to it all the time
where it was it
I used all the dances so I have a cousin
named gyre and he has music that sounds
exactly like like not exactly obviously
like it's his it's his own unique music
but he's like made songs before and they
sound like this and he sounds so good
actually when he comes out with a song I
think he is making a song on iTunes when
he comes out with it I've got a feature
in a playlist video and you guys are
gonna be mind blown because it's my
cousin he's really good music so this is
good first time I just got these they
were like on sale for $800 like pretty
cheap anyway they even have a nice
embroidered KP KP um it's not focusing
KP KP stands for kicking butt the song
is you know you might use a pretty boys
like at interpretive dancing if you just
feel like going like this in the morning
okay so I think that wraps up today's a
playlist video I'm guys enjoyed it these
are always so embarrassing but you guys
always ask for this video so I'm giving
them to you and I like going them
I hope you guys enjoyed them - make sure
you guys go buy my shirt and then we
could just be matching together and be
like cool and maybe buy some matching
socks you guys are also pretty concerned
that I was gonna make these super
expensive but no I I thrifted 20 bucks
so go ahead and check out the link you
guys do buy a shirt and you post a
picture of you wearing it and you tag me
I'm gonna go ahead and propose some of
you guys on my Instagram story so go
ahead and do that it'll be so cool and I
cannot forget it about like
international viewers so don't worry
there is worldwide shipping which is
awesome and that's about it for today's
video and I love you guys so much

music this was just a few my favorite
songs that I'm listening to currently
