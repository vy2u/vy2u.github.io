because you're that type of person
you're pressing the can I help you guys
can I'm subscribe me hey guys if you're
coming from vanilla she's Channel right
now
pause the video and go subscribe are you
done yet you're done okay if you guys
are not coming from any Lucy's channel
and you're here just on my channel
buddy you guys know it is a club with
mini Lucy 13 here on YouTube oh my gosh
her videos are so amazing I love the way
she edits them they're so creative and
like they just brighten your mood you
know and also I don't know why but
they've all gone viral so she must be
doing something right so at least go
subscribe to her channel and go watch
all her videos and see how great the
quality is today's video is going to be
a last minute Halloween costumes you
most likely have the product laying
around your house already and without
further ado let's get into the video
so this first costume idea is anything
zombie and basically the point of this
is that you can zombify really anything
you could do as zombie Miranda sings a
zombie princess whatever the heck it is
you want to do anyway so the state the
first thing you need to do is get some
eyelash glue and it makes the marks of
where you want your wounds to be and
then after letting that dry for like 20
seconds you're going to take a thin
piece of toilet paper and put that on at
the wounds so I'm taking in my Naked
palette and I'm taking a little bit
darker nude color and I'm putting that
on the some of the wounds then I'm
taking a bright red and I'm gonna put
that I'm trying to focus that right on
the center of where the wound is and
then I like take some gross purples and
browns and put around that put around
the room to make it look like it's
decaying so this is what you actually do
to the toilet paper and the is luhan's
dried you take some tweezers and pull it
a power and then you take your eye
shadow you just go to town with that and
also if you take some green eyeshadow
and put it on some parts of your skin it
looks like your skin's too ticket
decaying and so I thought that looks
cool and it looks really realistic and
you guys can like add some fake blood
so this next costume is kind of funny so
it's like if anyone says anything you
can just say your mom so it's you know
it's supposed to be your mom anyway
you're gonna need some pajamas and a
bathrobe but basically anything ugly
have to see something yeah
Jory amaze you dreaming every year so
that is gonna take you some clothes
stayin out there and then take some
clothes or anything around I didn't have
any balloons or anything but stuff that
up your shirt to make it look like
you're pregnant and then if you wrap the
clothes up in like some paper towels
then it makes it more round if that
makes any sense so this next one is
personally my favorite and it's Severus
Snape and what you're going to need is
anything black and flowy and very modest
and also take a twig and that can be
your wand and then preferably where no
makeup and just make yourself kind of
look a little ugly and old so yeah I
found my stick in the wilderness
watch.watch my strength this is the
scariest costume out of all of them and
it is the Slenderman um what you're
going to need for this is anything black
and you're gonna need a specifically a
black sweatshirt or a yeah black
sweatshirt I got my mannequin head from
a thrift store and most thrift stores do
sell mannequin heads if you guys did not
know that I want to make sure all your
hair is inside of the thing and you're
going to stick your head in like this
okay and then you're going to take your
and mannequin head you're going to speak
it on top of your head and then cover it
with the dish
then you're done so this is personally
like this is literally so scary like I
kind of scared myself making this it's
it's very creepy and also if you're
using an old sweatshirt you can like cut
it up cut out some eye holes in like
nose holes if that makes any sense I
didn't do that because this was like one
of my nicer sweatshirts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
