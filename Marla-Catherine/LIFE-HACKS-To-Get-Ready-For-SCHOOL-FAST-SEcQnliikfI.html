video we are going to you going to be do
but does not make sense they are going
to be doing the pageant for be late
again ever ever ever ever again because
I cannot express to you how close I was
being late to class every single day I
was turning once it was because my dad
before you guys move on into the video
let me tell you about this app hold on
but this is an app called school you
know and it helps you for like students
in school college students
kindergarteners literally anyone can use
that it's not easy and like you could
just share so much stuff and it's all
has to do with school so I actually
wrote some blog post and my one of them
was how to talk to your crush and I just
basically gave it what you're like tips
I'm kinda like naturally ease into
talking your crush and just like like
slide into those dm's like sign into
your crush be like hey I love this
because it's kind of like your own
miniature blog and you could just blog
about like what you do at school and
like how like what your problems are and
you can people can relate to you they
can answer your questions they'll be
links in the description box and you
guys can go follow me at Marla Kathryn
you know the usual and it's great just
it's also a good way to vent if you're
having a hard time school you just need
some answers with that being said let's
get right on into it you know the first
life back is kind of like a brainwashing
yourself a little bit but it's where you
take your arm alarm clock and you set it
20 minutes before you actually need to
wake up and then you get a hit snooze
twice and then you feel good like you
feel like you've slept it and when you
haven't or reality is the next life hack
is like washing your face waste the cold
water and it like shocks our nerves and
makes you awake and fresh and even just
washing your face helps and at night you
guys close your face with warm water and
that
the next tip is to put your hand braids
or like two twisty buns the night before
and then the next day we'll be able to
achieve a heatless curl and the great
part is its heatless and you won't have
to worry about taking time to curl it
the next one is picking out or a little
bit like of planning your outfit the
night before this saves a ton of time
and it's a lot less stressful especially
in the morning when you're running late
you're like what do I wear
which one the next tip I have for you
guys is to clean your room or at least
try you the floor the night before that
way for a clean freak then it's a lot
quicker and then all I have to do is
make your bed
and I don't know about you but I always
feel better when I have a clean space
and I can come home to a clean bedroom
the next tip I have your guys is the 5
minute makeup look and it's when you
take your BB cream and I used it up
mixed in the NYX illuminator with it to
make it like glowy
and then you put that on your face and
then you just take some like eyebrows
and you do mascara and not literally if
you can put you can push yourself and I
promise you you'll be able to do it in
five minutes I wish I found some better
sounds no one ever heard I wish I had a
better voice that sang some better words
I wish do the basics now on your face of
what you guys prefer I prefer my
eyebrows to be done and my mascara
that's a priority and I try to avoid any
eyeliner especially winged eyeliner cuz
I don't know about you but I suck at
that and that takes like 2 hours
that's it for today's video and thank
you guys for watching and let's
subscribe but let's get to 20,000
subscribers I know we can do it my
school starts on Tuesday and I want to
get there before school started studies
so remember to subscribe before you
leave and I've heard two youtubers say
this before but it's really true like if
you forget to subscribe you'll you'll
