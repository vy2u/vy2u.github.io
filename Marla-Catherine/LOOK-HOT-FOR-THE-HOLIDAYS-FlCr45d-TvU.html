going to be a get ready with me edition
of going to a like a holiday party so
this is probably what I would do if I
was going to take a fancy family
get-together or whatever I don't really
get invited to parties because um also
if you are freaking out for like Marla
are you okay are you abused like did you
just get out of a war zone like do you
own a wrap my face is not caught up my
face is much aggravated and I got ahold
of those face razors and I thought this
was the awesomest thing and I was going
to town a setting I cut myself so much
with the little face shavers anyway so
that's why I look like this to dry off
this makeup look I'm going to be using
my own idea I'm going to be using this
Nivea post shave balm but this is the
moat this is like the best primer for
makeup yeah right who's ringing my
doorbell oh I love taller owns now that
I put on my moisturizer I'm going to
move on to the baby skin instant pore
eraser and this is excellent for just
like making your skin all even and like
a flat surface to put on now that is all
blended out I'm going to move on to a
foundation so I'm using the Too Faced
Born This Way Foundation and then this
is in the shade light beige this stuff
is awesome for now taking my wet Beauty
Blender I know it's cut in half but
that's okay it still works
now I'm going to take my Revlon
Photoready pressed powder in the color
translucent and just put the Amin oh my
t-zone add my eyes so I have this little
trouble size addition a primer spray
from Scandinavia and I'm going to just
put that all over my face I know this is
it primer spray like I'm very where I'm
supposed to put on before but I'm doing
it after so I don't know about you but
putting on it like the setting spray or
the primary or whatever any type of
spray makes like like rejuvenate your
skin from doing you feel light so I just
got a brand new honest Asya one because
this is what my old one looked like so
basically it was dried out
crusty lumpy whatever you want close
look how like majestic that one looks
compared to that one I'm going to use my
bamboo will Ecotools
broad a finer and bro filler it's a duo
one and I really like this so I loaded
up my brush so I'm going to start in the
middle of my arch like around that area
I know that's really dark it's really
dark I was like black honey I thought
this was supposed to be light blue like
this is so bad okay don't with me so now
I need to blend out this one so now I'm
going to take my spoolie and just blend
it out trying to make it the color
spread out more evenly that way it's not
so intense
now I'm taking my essence make me bro
which is only two dollars so okay it's
out also I'm just going to set my
eyebrows with this I love this part so
much and my hair is like pulling out I
know a lot of people do the contour last
but I'm going to do right now so I'm a
little too excited this is this smashbox
step-by-step contour stick and this is
really intense so how you find your
cheekbone is white like making sure it's
like about and then you just go right
underneath and that is where you put the
contour like my nose contour is a
lopsided it is gonna swine so now I'm
taking the same brush that used to set
my powder with and just blend this all
out whoa I didn't have a jawline before
this video my nose contour so cricked
you only look what work your contour
it's so now moving on to eyes I'm going
to use this eye shadow that I got in my
Ipsy bag and so I've never really
written debris on it but it's M princess
and it's called it in the shade of
melting maple so now I'm going to use
the Venus palette and this is like the
awesome palette so on my lower lash line
men use this color right here called
muse and this is just going to add that
pop of like red like holiday color I'm
going to kind of flick it out almost as
if I have a window eyeliner on even
though I don't I literally look like a
dragon so six hours later I finally got
the individuals done this is my first
time doing them all myself and so it's
really intense but this I turned out a
lot better than this eye book okay now
I'm going to go back to the Venus
palette and I'm going to use their
lightest color with Aurra I don't know
how you say that it's that one right
there
pop it lock your polka dot add it to
finish everything off I'm going to use
it let's say so this is the one from
collar collar my lips i boy you need
some milk because my lifes take my chaps
my my lips are literally so trapped but
it's okay
I obviously never wear makeup because
I'm not good at it you're gonna want to
exaggerate you keep it so I'm gonna take
my highlighter and highlight my Cupid's
bow I'll be back BRB I don't wash off of
the liquid lip shape because obviously
I'm not like very talented at this
makeup look would probably look a lot
better if I had not put this on well do
not follow this to make routine at all
