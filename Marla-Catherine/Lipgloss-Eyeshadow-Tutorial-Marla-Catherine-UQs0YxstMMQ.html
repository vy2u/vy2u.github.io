my newest video and it is 2017 video and
I'm I'm so excited to share this makeup
look with you guys it was originally
gonna be an everyday makeup routine but
then we got a little bit of inspo so
this is going to be a glossy island
makeup tutorial and I'm so excited to
share this with you guys because I feel
it's really cute like oh and also this
is my tribute to Carrie Fisher who died
rip rip rip and also subscribe if you're
not subscribed or your star wars fan
like me okay into the video so to start
off I makeup look I have to have a
primer as setting spray or whenever you
guys want to call it and I'm using the
Mario but test the Mario Badescu facial
spray with aloe herbs in a rose water
and this stuff is the best setting spray
or what it's called primer spray you
will ever use and and it's seven dollars
like did they get better than that
no so I'm gonna spray this all over my
face so now that I primed my face I'm
going to go in with my Maybelline Dream
concealer and this isn't the color ivory
so I'm going to put this on all my
problem areas or blemishes but if you
guys want to call them there's a lot of
them just for your face and the thing I
love about that Mario Badescu primer
spray is it's like a little tacky like
it's kind of sticky so it makes your
makeup like steak a lot better and I
like to get my eyelids my eyelids are
just naturally red like I I don't know
why and I don't really do too much like
fancy Johnson whatever I put it on there
so once I have that all put on I'm going
to take my damp a Beauty Blender and
then blend that aw so I now have my web
Beauty Blender and I'm going and
okay so now that I'm my concealer all
blended out I'm going to go in with my
BB cream trusty old bean cream this is
the Maybelline Dream one and it's the
eight and one creep on skin clearing
Perfector and this is in the shade
medium sheer 10 so now I'm taking my
Ecotools slanted angle brush for brow
and then I'm taking my honest Daria
where is it and then I keep my honest
Razia in the color soft brown and I'm
going to be putting on my eyebrows you
know um I think I needed a wake-up call
but I'm never going to have waited yeah
I would be but my them watch and I
watched nut oil for my now like I have
the option of doing that okay so now I'm
done with my eyebrows I just need to set
them so you guys can use the essence
make me brow or whatever you guys are
gonna be wanting to use I don't we'll
have this link down below and if you run
out of that or if you want an extra
stronghold you guys can use a stronghold
perfume and if you guys want the extra
hole you guys can use a hairspray and
spray it on into a empty spoolie or
whatever Iligan all like a spoolie brush
I should have been in Star Wars because
I can find them okay so first I'm going
to put on it some new dude mini nude
eyeshadow by I don't know who this by so
so now I'm taking this really like fat
brush and then I'm gonna put on the
brush I look upon to 7-eleven so know um
so I just change my mind and sit around
this me and everyday making fourteen I'm
gonna it's gonna be a glossy eyelids
tutorial but this works out because
these are like the same color all right
so you want to use a pretty similar
eyeshadow base color to make it like
something to stick to and then I'm going
to spray some more Mario Badescu to make
it stick I'm using a pink lip gloss and
it's called candy baby and this is the
best smelling thing in the history of
the world so and I sometimes like to eat
it so I'm going to work a little bit
onto my finger then put that on
Krissy it's like glossy now I am a movie
on Ches Kara so you have to curl them
eyelashes and I just discovered arias
lifting and I want to get it done so
that raindrop cup I'm up which symbol
with the plum so I just finished doing
kind of like Twiggy mouska-tool again we
so to make this I'm trying to go for
like really pinky and rosy makeup look
so I'm gonna use a benefit dandelion
blush that I got recently I love it and
I love it
I'm gonna take a super fluffy brush and
put that on you know my cheeks much big
now I'm just taking a crappy Walmart I
shadow that looks like a highlighter
because I'm not rich so who needs a
Becca way you got the three dollar
maybelline you could never have too much
higher risk in a good direction normally
these children and then I'm topping it
all off with my matching people if gloss
the same things that I used on up my
eyes on my lips now
