no video hit that subscribe button smash
the like button hey guys it is Marla and
today I'm getting my braces off so I've
had my braces on for about a year and a
half so I got the mitt on in June 2016
and it's now October 2017 so it's been
about a year and a half roughly I did
not expect my braces to come off the
sooner I was expecting them gonna come
off around January late December it's
currently 9 at 10:00 in the morning and
the appointment is at 9:30 so we should
probably get going soon because we have
to drive there
you've like been of you're asking for it
now you see I wear my hair straight
I think I whiten your teeth here hope so
cuz they're kind of like butter I'll go
stick somebody I don't think you refer
to give them all look like grain like
when they shape your teeth I feel like
it gets super cool when they do it and
then I keep their sensitive and it hurts
after that I go oh drifted running ho ho
my sister's calls it their stuff slimy
oh my gosh it looks so good it's so good
we call any night we do not expect this
really satisfying
it feels so gross
all right what did you get I got I think
this is Oreo it looks really good
Orioles Armel Apple recommend this is
why I don't rent to 30 anybody come back
and I'll pick up my retainers to my
where at night and then I'm done oh and
they're also moving the bleach might
come around 2:30 and I can whiten my
teeth when you smile who it is okay I've
been like wanting this day since I was
literally six years old when I started
going to the orthodontist I can't
believe it's here look at my smile so
excited that's true that's eight years
right eight years I'm waiting for this
smile well I'm very happy and it's a
beautiful smile so thanks to my parents
so lovely mom and dad love you by the
way she's channel she will probably end
up longing about this some time soon so
go check that out it's actually a family
vlog Channel so we're probably gonna go
out to eat right now because it's about
lunchtime what the worst part of the
entire point meant was probably when
they were grinding my bottom teeth my
bottom teeth are more sensitive than my
top teeth but it hurts so bad it and
then also when she was popping off the
brackets itself that was giving me like
it didn't hurt too bad right kept on
like thinking she was cracking my teeth
when she wasn't no can't wait to go to
school tomorrow and look like a
different person
