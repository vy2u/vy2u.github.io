video it is going to be my mascara
routine I've been using babe lash for
four months now I think and it's made my
lashes a lot longer than what they were
before and so I thought I would share
with you guys my mascara team because a
lot of you guys were also requesting it
too and so these are some of the
products that I used to help my
eyelashes look longer and also naturally
curly because my lashes are naturally
straight but I do feel like the big lash
kind of helps them like keep their curl
better so I will link all that product
information down below if you guys want
to go check it out and purchase some of
it for yourself and without further ado
let's get into the video to start off my
eyelash routine I like to curl my
eyelashes with my shadow eyelash curler
and the reason why I love this eyelash
curler so much is because they make your
eyelashes look naturally curly and not
like straight you know you know what I
mean
like it's just such a good eyelash
curler and I'll have it linked it down
below because I can't I'm probably
pronouncing the name of the eyelash
curler wrong also when curling your
eyelashes remember to get the inner and
outer corners
for my mascara I like to use the
covergirl LashBlast waterproof mascara
and I use waterproof because it keeps my
ashes curly throughout the whole day the
reason why is because waterproof mascara
is made with an oil base instead of
water after we're applying my mascara
and letting it dry for like 10 seconds I
take a empty mascara bottle and take the
wand and then I like separate it through
like comb it through my eyelashes to
separate them a little bit more because
my eyelashes aren't very thick and
they're not very full and then I take a
little bit more of a dried on mascara
and then put that on my bottom lashes
now after doing that I take my cotton
swab q-tip whatever you want to call it
and I dip that in some coconut oil and
then you know obviously remove my excess
mascara and let me tell you right now we
probably already have you have probably
already heard this but I personally
think coconut oil is like Mother
Nature's magic eraser it literally take
out takes off my makeup so well and then
I just you know select the underneath my
bottom lash line
and we're before I forget remember to go
check out the babe wash it is so good
and I this isn't even a sponsored video
I just love that product so much and to
get my iOS she's got my lash line that
got extra full effect I take a
waterproof eyeliner and I put that in
the outer corners of my eyes and I just
helps also like make my eyes seem more
like that almond shape and that's all I
do for my last routine
thank you guys for watching remember to
subscribe and give it a thumbs up and
comment down below what video you guys
