gonna be doing a minimalistic fall
makeup look so I was like you know it's
fall it's literally so cold outside it's
like 60 degrees I just not fall spirit
and so I wanted to do makeup tutorial
but I feel like most of the time fall
makeup tutorials are super heavy and I
guess there's nothing wrong with that
but that's just not my preference so I'm
gonna be showing you guys a minimalistic
fall makeup look and I think this is a
really pretty everyday makeup look that
just has a fall spin on it
okay so to start off first off like who
invited this little puff to the party
Tommy but he still showed up most the
time year round it's dry so I always
have to make sure I have a good
moisturizer and this is my currently
favorite one it's the origins ginseng
energy boosting gel moisturizer and
that's a mouthful but this thing is
awesome I love it so much this thing is
literally so good and I like to put it
on in the morning and at night because
my skin so I've been back to school for
about a month now and I think public
schools like it's decent like it wasn't
as bad as I expected it to be not that I
haven't I've been to poke to my entire
life I don't know I just had expected
totally so much worse when I came back
since I'd missed that 8th grade year but
it wasn't and I'm really glad and
everyone's so super nice so that's good
so like you guys in on it insider scoop
I didn't think about doing some music on
my channel and not that I'm very good or
anything I don't know I just I feel like
I've been wanting to do that like it
that just sounds like so much fun so
leave a comment down below if you guys
would be interesting and seeing any of
that and my other idea is I want to
start a blog and
like I really want to start a blog and I
think that'd be so much fun so also let
me know if you guys want me to do some
of that so yeah let me know your
thoughts and opinions down in the
comment section down below I'm gonna
head on over to natural face makeup so I
don't like to wear a full face of makeup
but what I like to do is take the CC
cream it's it cosmetics your skin
whether it's CC cream I can mix this
with my Sephora make no mistake high
coverage concealer and I mix them to
make like like a thinner concealer and
so I'm gonna go ahead and do that so
much so then I mix it with a little bit
of this
and then I take my finger and I mix
those two together and then I walk the
excess off into my face and take my
Beauty Blender which is damp and I'm
gonna go ahead and blend that out so as
you can see this side has the coverage
like it has the face week one and then
this side doesn't it just makes it look
more like even and pretty and like you
have a perfect complexion when you don't
now I'm gonna go in with a little like
the wind Zients amount you could even
like imagine I'm gonna take a little bit
of concealer and I'm gonna put that on
this thing this mountain air this is
volcano and I'm gonna try to cover that
up and then put a little bit and
underneath my eyes I try to avoid
putting too much product underneath my
eyes because it starts to look super
cakey then and this one is the NARS
radiant creamy concealer and this one is
pretty good by the way I do have eyelash
extensions so if you guys are new to my
channel that is why it looks like I'm
wearing mascara I do have to get them
filled because I've had them for almost
four weeks now no it was three weeks
yesterday so it's Wednesday today and it
was three weeks ago
so I'm getting them a fill two on Monday
and that will be good but that is why it
looks like I'm already wearing mascara
so now I have my face makeup blended out
a minute we want your bronzer I like
looking bronzy all year long that's just
how I prefer but if you guys don't want
to you then you can just skip this step
I'm using the Bahama Mama and this is a
super good bronzer and it looks like
this it's by the balm and I love the
bomb they're so good and I'm not
contouring I'm just bronzing so it looks
smiling but this like it helps me to
find my like where my cheekbones would
be so now to use some cloud pain and
this is by glossier and I really really
love this cheek color I think it's super
pretty very pink and I think even though
it is a more following up tutorial I
think it's super important to use blush
cuz I just think it brings your face
back to life so now I'm gonna move on to
eyebrows and eyebrows are also very
honestly everything I just cracked my
neck I'm gonna go in and take my Sigma
small angle e65 brush and I really love
this brush for eyebrows it's super
defined I'm taking my ELF lock-on liner
and brow cream this is basically the
like perfect for the honest eyes here by
and then I take the spoolie and I'm
gonna go in and blend that out I'm going
to Disneyland it for the first time
super soon and I'm so excited so comment
down below your favorite rides at
Disneyland and your favorite things to
do there and the favorite your favorite
like places to go eat cuz I would it be
very appreciated and I know I'm probably
like past the age to like love Disney
but I'm so excited now my brows are
defined and I think they turned out
pretty good today
don't you just love it when you like
brush your eyebrows like three eyebrow
hairs
and that shake it so since this is a so
that's it so this is a pretty little
mystical so this is a pretty
minimalistic makeup look but I want them
to like to make it that fall I'm gonna
add some eye shadow and this is the
perfect palette for it to the modern
renaissance someone and I spilled some
blush like cream blush on it and it
landed in this Nike logo coincidence I
think not you may take this super pretty
orange color and it's called the burnt
orange right there and I'm gonna put
that into my crease and then I'm gonna
go and take this dark orange color and
it's one right here it's regal real real
guard always doing that wrong I'm gonna
go and take this super free a
highlighter but Sephora collection it's
the Golden Hour one I'd really love this
one I'm gonna go take that and put it in
my owner corners and then also highlight
and then whenever is excess on my brush
needs to be over my brow bone and then
I'm gonna take this one by Sephora
collection and it's the tool to brush
and it's a multitasker one I'm going to
take their big outside of that and I'm
gonna apply some highlighter and then
I'm gonna take this color which I think
it's perfect for fall and and it's not
like too intense but it's the glossy a
generation G their lipsticks and it's
the shade of Leo and this one is so
pretty I love it so much and it's just
very pretty like warm brown and I love
these lipsticks because they're super
buildable and that's awesome because you
just want a sheer chin but you can get a
shoot in but if you want more of an
intense lip then you can still get that
intense lip
I'm gonna go get some tissue paper and
then I'm gonna go ahead and blow my lip
and just like that that complete system
makeup lick it's not too intense but
it's still like you get those follow
vibes without freaking out and I do like
it and it's perfect for everyday wear
too and I that works with this video
