I told hi guys it's marla and welcome
back to my channel today's video is a
hug get glowy skin because we all want
to know how to do that and i hope that
you guys don't have to so I personally
struggle with some acne and not glowy
skin and just you know everyday teenage
skin problems and so I hope that that be
tips help you because we must certainly
do help me also a huge shout out to mix
nature for sponsoring this video their
products are so awesome they're
completely customizable to your skin
they're all natural it's just such an
awesome company and all have more
information as the video goes on but as
for now let's get started so the first
step to having glowy skin is washing
your face regularly so this is my
favorite cleanser it's the one by mixed
nature and mine is for my combination
skin and so it's perfectly like
moisturizing but not too oily and this
makes my skin feel so smooth it's like
ridiculous I've never used anything that
makes my skin feel so good
so my next advice or step to having glow
skin is that you think a face mask every
once in a while this one it was
primarily for moisturizing my skin and
this makes my skin feel also just very
velvety but my one complaint about it is
that it's not a peel-off mask and that's
the only thing I would change about it
but other than that it's so good and I
love it
and always just moisturizing your skin
daily before you do your makeup after
you do your makeup when you wash off
your makeup always moisturize because it
makes your skin it looks so much clearer
and feel much healthier so mixed
nature's also sent me a moisturizer but
you can always switch it up by using
other ones my other go to is this one by
Clay it's all friend of ole way but hey
it works just fine it's like the same
thing and it's so much cheaper also
using toner is a good thing to even out
your skin tone it is a little bit drying
but that's okay
and also hot spoons are the coolest
because they reduce the size of your
pimples like none other
don't burn yourself but basically just
heat up the spoon underneath hot water
it does have to be boiling and press it
onto your problem areas and by the next
morning it should help reduce your
problem areas the in size and it just
helps calm them down it works so well
for me so to make your skin look extra
dewy without even like just trying is
using like Glomus so I got these by pixi
they're so awesome
so as hydrated milky mints or like
Glomus the glow mix literally makes your
skin look like you just like dipped it
in oil but it doesn't feel like that
anyway it looks it makes it look so
glowy and I love playing this on after I
do my makeup thank you guys for staying
to the end of the video to exceed us
outro if you guys change to go and
purchase some of mix nature's products
which I highly recommend I'll have a
coupon code it down below make sure to

ok bye thanks watching let's look at
hair but is not about back with a very
modest butt
