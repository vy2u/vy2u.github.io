gonna be flowing a favorites video you
guys love these videos and I love them
too they're really useful so I had a
huge struggle with my background today
and I finally settled for this it's
really distracting I hope you guys don't
mind it yeah literally it's a blank wall
it's all I could do I haven't done this
sit-down video in quite a while and so I
thought it'd be good to do this like I
said today's video is gonna be a monthly
favorites video it's me my March
favorites and these are just some things
I've been loving and been using I
actually applied concealer today like
all right so without further ado let's
just get into the video so they say
sorry if I touch my hair so much I'm
just like kind of sweaty and I kind of
just struggling today but gotta film
okay so I'm slightly off centered
because I'm gonna be putting the
Instagram account or whatever right here
so this first online favorite is this
Instagram account and it's called Ruthie
Barone I probably am saying that so
wrong but she basically has super
editorial and super very like very very
original makeup looks and I love them so
much like she just comes up with the
coolest things ever I don't even know
how she does it she has such cool makeup
looks and she also does have a YouTube
channel
this is anyone a club or anything but
I'll link it down below I just can't
this is another Instagram account and
it's iris Patel I am also probably
saying that wrong but basically she just
says it's kind of just like her own
Instagram account and it's not anything
specific but I just love the way she
does her makeup I don't know how to
explain it
she's just like the prettiest natural
wing she's just a very pretty person
anyway I love her Instagram photos I
think they're so cool okay so this next
thing of am loving is watching the
office clips on YouTube eat it eat it
you're killing him Michael
let me see you swallow it oh your mouth
under your tongue oh there's like the
YouTube channel the office us and I just
haven't been watching you off the clips
my sister and I have one bust out that
all of them we love Dwight Schrute
Dwight sure you have my heart literally
they're so funny I don't know and I love
all the pranks that Jim pulls and I
think Kevin's dog Ruby that's intense
anyway I love the office clips I would
highly recommend oh I think I just want
a good luck okay so then at the next
thing I've been loving is
I don't know thanks videos very like
boring for you guys but if I could talk
about tumblr a lot but I just really
loved the whole app itself you got you
kind of to be careful in there because
there's some weird things but when you
find like good accounts anyway I do have
an account it's probably underscore a
million just from like the Lana Del Rey
song it's just I've been loving tumblr
and I feel like it's super inspirational
for when you just want to be inspired
and by the way it's also kind of
dangerous because I'll gone there and I
like see lots of fashion inspiration and
I bought a pair of shoes the other day I
bought these shoes the other day my next
favorite for this category is a website
called Skillshare and they're actually
sponsoring today's videos if you guys do
not know what sculpture is it's an
online learning community where they
have over 17,000 classes to choose from
Premium Membership starts at $10 a month
which is actually way affordable if
you're trying to learn something new
they have cement I repeat photography
videography they definitely have a wide
range of classes so there's definitely
one for you is to go ahead and check it
out I got a guitar back in December and
I'm still learning how to play it but
sculture actually has some classes on
how to play the guitar so it's
definitely been helping out a lot and I
love it so much because it helps me to
better my music which I am trying to
work on which don't quote me on that
go straight definitely helps you to meet
your goals in a very affordable and easy
way but instead of paying $10 a month
the first 275 people that click the link
in the description box get to you
Skillshare for two months for an only 99
cents literally a dollar like that's so
cheap those spots fill up but really
fast so make sure you guys go ahead and
check out the link and you can use it
just like I am you can learn the guitar
together you can struggle together this
website is awesome if you want to pick
up a new skill I'm basically anything
and it's very affordable and it's very
easy so go ahead and check oh sure so
for the next category I'm gonna be doing
my hair feed Birds
okay so for my hair I've been trying to
keep it healthier lately and so I picked
up a few products I've been using them
loving so okay so this first product is
from Urban Outfitters I'm sure they
probably sell at other places but it's
called the grow it girl and it basically
is a hair you spray it into your hair
after you got out of the shower it helps
my hair to feel super silky and very
healthy I'd highly recommend it I've
only been using it for about two weeks I
think but I definitely feel like it's
improved my hair quality so these next
hair favorites are accessories in their
headband
I've been I don't know I've always loved
headbands but would you subscribe I know
I love her bands I think they're way
cute these are from Urban Outfitters but
even the ones at Walmart are cute
my next hair favorite is this wet brush
if you guys don't know what a wet brush
is it's basically a brush but you use it
when your hair is wet when you use this
in a hurry when it's wet like it brushes
through your hair so pretty easily
anyway it's super gentle on your hair I
would highly recommend and this is the
wet brush Pro so so this lost hair
favorite is this one right here and it
kind of busted the cap off basically
it's this coconut milk anti breakage
serum and this makes my hair feel so
silky smooth you can buy I got this off
Walmart and I think it was like eight
bucks or something and it's really
informal cause it's from our home and
for the next category I'm doing my
random favorites okay so from a next one
it's makeup favorites and this is my
Holy Grail
I'm wearing my pajamas basically this is
the best eyebrow gel I've ever used it
makes me so excited just talking about
it on associa by Beverly Hills clear
brow gel this I don't know what it does
to your eyebrows but it works so well
and my eyebrows it's that perfect
mixture of setting your eyebrows but not
making them crusty okay so this isn't
makeup but this is a lotion and it's the
hemp fresh coconut and watermelon there
smells like summer like if somewhere was
the scent not so we're making like the
summer of the season if this is a scent
it would smell like this this smell kind
of reminds me of the sour patch kids
watermelon flavor along with senti
things these are my two favorite
perfumes currently it's the Daisy by
Marc Jacobs this has been my favorite
since like the seventh grade but then I
also got this one recently and it's a
pink sugar I probably won't be able to
wear it during the summertime folks it's
like mosquitoes would just eat me alive
and then the last three products from my
beauty favorites is this is the first
one it's the beauty by pop sugar and
it's an ice shimmer but it's basically
it's a nice shimmer
putty powder and it's in the shade out
of this world it literally is like a
putty but it's an eye shadow and it's
super glittery and I love it so much and
it has such a natural like inner glow
look and I love putting this just on top
of my eyes I'm not wearing it today but
this probably will be featured in a lot
more makeup tutorials because I love it
so much
my last category is basically random
favorites I didn't find so many pairs of
earrings lately and it's because I've
been upset but I
to some recently these are just studs
these are from forever 21 I love the
brand new mobile earrings I just have
not a big fan of hoops I'm not trying to
be hater I just really like them and I
feel like I would have a fear of
something like just ripping out or my
hair get caught and then I'd go like
that and accidentally rip my earlobe but
yeah anyway so my next random favorite
is really random like I don't think you
expected this but their calligraphy pens
I got these from this Japanese store
back in California and I don't know
they're just so satisfying like if you
guys like to watch those satisfying
compilations where it's just like them
doing calligraphy these are like the
type of pens that they use and they were
actually surprisingly really cheap and
I've just been using them in my journal
and they're really satisfying I really
love them okay and then last but
certainly not the least are these shoes
I got these probably like two weeks ago
but they're the Nike Air Force Ones low
top kind of forget how I found out about
these but I just saw them online I
thought they were cute and I've been
wearing them so much with just
everything I feel like since they are
white but I probably sell them on tumblr
or something that wraps up today's that
monthly favorites video if you guys like
this video give it a thumbs up you guys
actually commented and said that there
is a hand loose emoji and I'm really
excited about that so give this video a
thumbs up and subscribe and do all that
stuff I didn't mention any music
favorites because I normally do a
separate like music favorites video so

see a music favorites video and yeah

go ahead and check out Skillshare I'll
