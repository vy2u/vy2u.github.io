watching my video and thanks for
clicking on that k so today's video
obviously but entitles it to my March
favorites and I'm going to be sharing
them but with you guys and I've quite a
few so let's just get started so I'm
going to start off with my food saver
starting with these lemoncello
almonds and they're roasted almonds
covered in white chocolate and lemon
cream these are what's up these are so
good their bikes canta and basically
they are just almonds that are covered
in white chocolate and under different
to us lemon glaze and they look like
Steve tastes so good like I can't even
if you they sell these at Costco so do
not try these go try another silver
they're like addicting okay so next I
know the bigness is ultimate able to
flip see fat boy these are the tio2
flamin hot kind and I love this is my
favorite epic Eidos these are also
addicting lychee or like do not have
these in your pantry at the same time
because that's dangerous these are so
bad they're just basically Cheetos that
there is a spicy kinda and I love spicy
stuff and so this is it's really nice
just to have and enjoy so the next one I
don't have with me because it's in the
freezer but they're all cyi tactics I
have been obsessed with those because I
did realize how good it tastes
and also it's so easy I just got mine
from Trader Joe's and they're like the
non sweet and kind about way from
sweeten it to how I want black one is
this shake by a career PO protein it's
160 calories one grocer and three grams
of protein I know I know I know they
think they're not the healthiest for you
and you should be drinking them every
day except like fake sugar in them or
whatever but they're really good for
when you're like not in the know to eat
food but you just want to eat something
so the pixels you also just that and I
think you all know it Cheetos was what
sometimes ensure that's all for my three
favorites
next time is beauty favorites and I did
find a few products are I've become
obsessed with lately
pixie study it's not sponsored but they
just sent me some of their products
exactly alder well they sent me Oliver
smooth okay they sent me all these grace
and it's a makeup matched a hydrating
mask wake up man and as Welli list so
detailer miss miss miss miss I couldn't
miss like ten times lots of it basically
what they are is like they have
different type of sprays to like wake
you up this one makes you look so glowy
of an obsessed with using this and then
this is just there this is like the same
thing as a Mario Badescu I really love
this one it's just ridiculous and then
this one I love spraying on at night
because it hydrate and I I don't like
putting on lotion at night but I love my
song it's just hydrate ah
the next product is I've always loved
covergirl LashBlast Volume Mascara like
that in my Ulta I love the wand I love
the product I just love it so I've been
using Katie cat eye by Katy Perry de
Rutger I don't really like it but I was
just having gotten around to buying a
new one so what about myself a new
mascara and the reason why I trained
this because I already know they love it
but I I have block brown instead of very
black you said this looks more natural
and also whenever consents to expel like
I'm still tell so when I put all my
black mascara it does not look good I
don't know I just don't I like the way
look and so I got black brown and this
literally like I don't know what I was
wanting this before it doesn't look so
harsh against my skin tone and also I
just like the color of it so the next
product in my beauty favorites is this
Wet n Wild lip gloss but it's clear up
it's like two bucks at Walmart and this
is perfect for doing Wasi eyelids and
also I love wearing this I just love
wearing like clear like I know I just
don't really like colored lip glosses or
like whatever but this like makes your
lips look shiny I like it a lot it's why
while okay man you guys almost witness
high-def on camera
so the last item in my beauty favorites
is this little guard here
I don't like curling my hair because it
first off the kitchen forever second off
it is really damaging and I'm trying to
grow out my hair and so I but when I do
like to Cohen hair it's like this it
seems like I don't know what did curls
you want to color so basically I've
enough stuff it's braiding my hair at
night when it's kind of like I just wet
it down with a spray bottle and then
when I take it out in the morning I will
just section it off and put like six
curls on each layer using this and it
comes out looking like this which I
really like I like kind of like that for
whiny Grainger vibes you know like that
super silencing nationals basically I
really like this it's a one-inch curling
wand next category is clubbing favorites
so first up is this sweater that I'm
wearing it's doing more of a sort of
like wearing your hair up because it has
like cut out it's not an
off-the-shoulder cut up just like shows
like more of your collarbones it's like
a wire thing and then it's super comfy
it's from shop luckily I'll have it
linked down below and it has like
thicker kind of felt like a gradual bill
sleeve sorry looking to be lighter
so I next product or the next clothing
item I like three the next one I stole
from my sister I don't know I just kind
of look like vintage and like I've never
been to Disneyland so I'm such a fake
fans I think it's cute it is this like
distressed Disney that you're awake play
looks like this not really showing up on
camera but like the Disneyland is all
distressed and it's this navy blue with
the white and the red I think it's so
cute and it's so nice to be able to
throw on a pair of like leggings or
jeans and look so cute so adorable so
put together whether or not I do have
more clubbing favorites but I showed
them in my fifth store also go check out
that video if you want to see the rest
of the clothes that I've shown this
month home
and then my next category is lifestyle
favorites I don't have to think because
I didn't know people in this category or
the first one is this ukulele especially
my sisters I want to get one for my
birthday but an actual one purse is red
I just want to get everyone one for my
birthday but basically I was feeling
just from her all the time
and I not play like five songs I'm
really getting into it lately and it's
just I think it's such like a small and
just fun instrument to learn so the last
category you guys were requesting a like
just a full-on video just for it but I
just thought I will just put it to my
March favorites but basically it's my
music favorites in my favorite songs at
the moment so I'm going to go and play
them for you guys hold on having
technical difficulties so be my first

song and it's not even that big of a
song but I think the seniors like really
good like I can tell it's 100 songs are
pulling I can blow up this is like
really awkward I'm sorry
