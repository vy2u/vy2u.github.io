the Walters I just my cousin Jerry
showed me this one and I loved it
let's go Jason you look so nice
it's one of our songs I mean you're not
always in the mood for that type of
music but it's good for when you're just
like doing homework or you just want
kind of a more slack song interesting
song but the walters actually have such
good music I had listened to a few of
their songs on YouTube and then my
cousin showed me this one and then I was
like legit so there's that song and
you've probably heard of that one but
the one that I found from them that I'm
obsessed with currently is called candy
wrappers and I loved it so much

super like summary
that's the most country song I will
listen to I just don't understand
country music I don't need to be mean
but like I highlighted my own personal
opinions and I'm just not a fan of
country music the most country I
listened to is Johnny Cash pretty good
there's electric counts on the hill haha
I love a country farm
this is another one that is one of those
songs so if you like your way can always
be in the mood for I kid at my school

enjoyed it is it was a little bit more
relaxed and I ate some food and I talked
about music so coachable hey guys found
my channel and by the way I also read

designed you know that hands the hands
of flowers the thumbs up you know I
relaunched that shirt because you guys
were asking for it the campaign goes
into a little April 4th and then they're
gone again and I don't know if I would
