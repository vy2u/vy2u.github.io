going to be doing a makeup tutorial
obviously so I'm really excited to share
this to you guys
I do get hate a lot on how my makeup
tutorials are the same as I try to
switch it up today it's going to be a
70s inspired bronzed look I don't know
how I'm going to title this but it's
basically somebody's inspired and it's
super bronzy and highlighted and cute
all hearts cool will be linked down
below so don't worry don't spread let's
just get started what's up so I'm going
to start off by using my mile the desk
you spray this one is the green one so
like the green tea one so I'm using this
today for my primer and for setting and
all that good stuff I want my skin to
look really good but I don't want to be
wearing foundation so I'm going to be
using a high coverage concealer and then
a BB cream so this BB cream is my
all-time favorite I finally bought
myself a new one I've been using the
other one the CG smoother I did not like
someone else I really like this one
though it's the magic skin Beauty fire
deep cream and I got the shade medium
which I really have never gotten a shade
medium I've always been so pale I got
really tan the past couple of days
not really but a lot I mean tan enough
to get this shade I go in and I just do
this I kind of like to draw some designs
because it's kind of fun so now that I
look like Soul Calibur tribe I'm going
to go in and take my fingers and I'm
going to go and blend that in so now
that I'm like super streaky but it is
blended in like it's the color is now
matched I'm going to go in and take my
damper Beauty blutter and I blend it all
in and make sure there's no like streaks
or children let me use a return I'm
sorry for things like to talk to you so
now my skin neck coverage thing is all
blended out so I'm going to go into some
Stealer so for concealer today we are
using the NARS radiant creamy concealer
I bought this like in May but I've gone
like a shade darker since May because
like beginning of May because I've gone
a little bit more tanner I can tell a
difference seems public and but I just
go and I focused on all my blemishes and
I don't like to he'll put too much
concealer on because I feel like then it
starts lip Kiki and I do not going for a
sneaky look I don't think anyone is and
that's where I'd normally put my
concealer I look so crazy I'm so sorry
normally I like to go in with my finger
first and then I just dab it
then I blend it out with the beauty
blender click you like my finger has
more control instead it's baking now as
you can tell like it's super like Brian
are you mad and I don't really like that
I just like it being like an even skin
tone so I'm gonna going I'm going to
warm it up with some bronzer so let's
get into it so today and not I'm
probably not use the hoola bronzer just
a little bit but I want to switch things
up and so I'm going to be showing to my
other favorite groans there is another
super awesome and both of them are like
with samples got to do what you got to
do this one is the Too Faced Sun bunny
natural bronzer it's so pretty
it's like kind of sparkly though which I
wish it wasn't because I have more matte
bronzers but this one's super pretty
still it looks like that and then at
this one it's called the Bahama Mama
they really keep going today by the balm
cosmetics I love the balm cosmetics so
today I'm going to be using this brush
the same brushes in every single
tutorial for my bronzer it's the lucky
514 blush brush it's so fluffy and
loaded so I'm going to go to the home on
and then load it in on my brush even
know that it's such like a small like I
can't really even say my brush in there
and I'm going to squeeze my brush that
way to my like dense and then I'm going
to go in and kind of make like a full
contour it's not like contour it's just
so long as a concealer in my eyes that
was really intense I did not expect it
to be like that and then I go on with
the Sun bunny and I'm going to like
blend it to look like this and one like
that and then I'm going to blend it out
with that and any excess on your site
working on my drawn line right now I've
never done this makeup tutorial before
this is my first time not even on camera
and now I'm going to do the same steps
on this side and hope it turns out and I
don't really like to contour hang out
because I always mess that up and that
looks so gross but I had to do sweeps
and bronzer over my knowledge just like
this I'm just a little bit underneath it
and then just a little bit underneath my
lip I can't believe II it was like such
about I lines cuz I like I've been
sleeping good but I feel five eggs
okay so bronzer kind of scares me I'm
gonna vote how I'm gonna do my eyebrows
now so I'm taking my eyebrow brush this
is just the Anasazi
one and I brush my eyebrows first and
then I'll do a so much hay on my
chapstick for out than I did in my
everyday makeup 14 I said I get like so
tense when I do my makeup because like I
don't know how it's going to turn out so
not so I'm going to go in and set my
eyebrows with and my glossier
I was brackets 2x windows most of the
time I like my eyebrow shade color it's
just I just want to set them and so this
is great going this and then I take the
excess and I like kind of schooling it
over my eyebrows and then I've let it in
once poured and then once backwards and
forward again so you're going and I'm
gonna do blush and I'm going to be using
blockade cloud pain I'm so obsessed with
these they're my favorite so I'm gonna
go in put a little bit onto my fingertip
you really don't need that much because
a little does go a long way and I wrote
it between my fingers and then I smile
yeah I'm not very attractive when it's
on makeup sometimes I just go in as one
that wasn't Peters just to add a little
nice healthy glow okay so now I'm going
to do eyeshadow so I'm going to be using
this color called a burnt orange and I'm
going to go in on my lid with dot and
I'm going to take the extras I'm gonna
onto my lower lash line okay so for a
week I'm going to be using the l'oreal
paris telescopic waterproof eyeliner
looks like this i can't i drop this in
the toilet that's okay it still worked
so I first like to make the wings and
then I go and mix the lashline and then
I connect them is loaded so now let me
do the other eye and the key to it
looking like super like 70s is to make a
little bit thick and then I have like a
flick tweak
Mylene dilator is now done and they
turned out pretty good considering us
doing it like for a video because
normally when i do i winged eyeliner for
a video never turns out so I'm not going
to be curling my eyelashes with the a
shoeshine yawa eyelash curler every one
and then it using the covergirl volume
lash blast waterproof mascara and the e
shade black brown so I focus at the root
and then I shake it up and then I'm
going to go and do my lower lash line
and so I'm going to go in and kind of go
like this oh my gosh
just and then I'm going to take a little
bit of winged eyeliner and just draw on
like some stick like being very lightly
because I don't want to be too
noticeable might as well come and define
a little bit more and now I'm going to
go repeat the same steps onto my other
eye now I just kind of like to run my
brush over my eyebrows to mess them up
even more they really I don't really
like that defined look consciously now
literally there's only like two steps
left I mean easy to save their brush my
this brush I'm going to be using at
Becca's at Champaign highlighter is such
a pretty color it's very warm toned and
that's what just look it's kind of all
about going to go and just apply some
that whoa until I know who my Cupid's o
to middle my forehead and a little bit
too underneath my browbone literally
like highlighter every word so first
time it applies and traffic's I don't
want to look too chop to spoon I want to
look dry and crusty I'm just applying
like one of the chapstick duo one's this
one's mango and it smells so good and
then I apply my lipstick and just such a
pretty color
yeah I really like the generation G
lipsticks by Garcia because they're
super buildable and it like add color to
your lips but as it looks doesn't look
as intense so this complete sort of luck
I hope you guys enjoyed it and I'll see
you love you guys and I'll see you in my
next video and hit the like button if
you want so huh okay so okay on my
eyebrows so do I care no you ah
