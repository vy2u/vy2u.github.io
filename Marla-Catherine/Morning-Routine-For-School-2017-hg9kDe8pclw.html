if you're new here you know the drill is
a subscribe button this is going to be
my 2017 at school morning routine and
we're due in the morning so I hope you
guys enjoy it and look into any video to
start my morning routine I obviously
have to wake up so yo look at that face
and I get out of bed and I walk to the
bathroom - you just admire my pain and I
then take a shower so after that I go
and choose up my outfit which I don't
really know I do because there's no one
to impress really and after that I brush
my teeth because it's less about my
orthodontist hope you
now that I brush my teeth and all that
I'm going to do my makeup and I already
filled in my brows and on just on you
know concealer BB cream and off stuff if
you guys want a everyday makeup routine
it go check out the description box
because I already have that video posted
now that I've done that I'm going to
tell drawing eye here and then blow-dry
it that way it's not all wet and soft
you want to go too so now that that's
all done I put on my school outfit so my
top is from at Kara lace my jeans are
from Aeropostale and I don't show my
shoes because they're my honor so yeah I
love ugh there's just a dark wash on
this Cara Lee stop I literally wear
everyday and my backpack is from
Claire's from a Fiat my last year's back
to school video anyways been with me all
the time then I go in eeeh breakfast so
I'm normally just grab something quick
like a granola bar and banana they're
delicious nutritious and after that I
head out the door to go to the bus stop
and I don't just walk to the bus stop I
RipStik like like the coolest cat in the
home turn neighborhood so don't even
fight me on that just getting it on all
mine schoolers
which I think I do want one cool after I
realized I don't belong with the
Russell's breed I run downstairs as fast
as I can to get away from everything and
then I log on to school and I normally
like to grab the laptop in sit in at my
bed just long time thanks guys so much
for watching and yes I do do online tool
so I did some of this as if I did public
school but normally unemployed just wake
up right when school starts my run that
run as fast as I can to get the laptop
in I miss my pajamas maybe I try again

top of the subscribing you guys we did
