and today's video is a very highly
crusted video my everyday makeup routine
as you guys can see I'm already wearing
makeup but in the video I'm not so so to
start off with I'm going to be using my
pixie flawless beauty primer and this is
just to kind of even out my skin tone
and my face
then I went out my taking add my take my
Beauty Blender you can blend it out so
now that I primed my face I'm going to
move on to the actual coverage of like
myself flourishes I'm only 12 and so I
don't wanna be wearing foundation a
whole heavy face makeup and I still want
to be like and breezy yeah
so this is an anti redness cream by
L'Oreal and should beeping the and a BB
and then I like to take mix that with my
um actual 8 in one beauty balm skin
Perfector in in the Maybelline bro so
then I actually mix those and dots on my
face and I blended a lot together and we
are to always blend it out into your
drawing and into your neck though you
don't have like this weird why
I then also like to bring the excess
product onto my eyelids because my
eyelid you can see all the veins and
they get really red and that kind of
looks gross so then I'm going to flip my
beauty blender over to the pointy side
in the going like around here where it's
a little bit smaller parts and I'm going
to blend that out super good so now I'm
moving on to I normally do my eyebrows
next so I do not do this every day this
is just on days it feels very creative
and full of life so for my eyebrows I am
actually you I would say actually okay
so for my eyebrows I use the Maybelline
New York brow defined plus fill duo by
eye studio and this stuff works just as
well as the anastasiya by Beverly Hills
and this is like half the price so go
get it
so uh last but not least because it sets
your eyebrows make sure they stays they
stay in all day it is on the elf clear
brow and lash mascara I just use it for
the eyebrows I do not use it for the
eyelashes take a look ladies and
gentlemen the next trend up I'd say okay
um I got a situation with you
okay now I just got to do the next
eyebrow so next up I'm going to be doing
some eyeliner and I actually got this
eyeliner from something called the
better beauty box and and will actually
have a link down in the downbar to get
your own better beauty box in a monthly
subscription um this is in the shade or
in the color pros and bronze like pros
and cons except it's bruised and bronze
pros and broads okay nevermind let's
just move on so next up is my eyes and
if you guys have been watching my
channel for a little bit longer you guys
would know that my eyelashes are
naturally straight on top of that my
ashes aren't even that stripped by even
that long so I have to use a really good
eye lash curler to make them stay and
this is that I don't even know if I'm
pronouncing it right but it's pronounced
I don't know she she know she shade oh
she's you I think it's the shishito
eyelash curler from Sephora
act quick with waterproof so um next up
is setting my whole entire face with a
powder and this is literally the best
powder ever it's the Revlon Photoready
and it works in just as well as the Make
Up For Ever HD powder if not even better
okay thanks guys for watching to give
this video a thumbs up and leave a
comment down below whether you have a
Twitter not K by never really thought we
were making maybe think about what could
have been but we've had a record someone
cancer
