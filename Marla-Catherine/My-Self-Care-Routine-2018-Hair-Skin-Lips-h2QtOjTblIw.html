video today sorry for my absence I've
been out of town so today we would be
filming a self-care routine I was
inspired by kind of just like Vogue
videos and I wanted to skincare routine
but I kinda wanna show some new products
that I've been liking for my hair and my
lip so I was like you know what I'm just
gonna do a self-care routine I recently
even like strangely obsessed with live
care routine like Libertines I don't
know it but it kind of works so I'm
gonna show you guys those routines and
tips so let's get started into this
video the first time I have been loving
like ask your mom for this no literally
this product is like really good I don't
know how we create things like this but
I'm just grateful tier it's called the
Amika nourishing masque and this isn't
sponsored or anything they did send us
to meet up and I've been using it so
much so I guess I was like sea buckthorn
berry no clue what that is but it works
and it literally makes my hair so soft
so I just put it in like five minutes
before I go into the shower and I lather
it throughout like the ends of my hair
especially I shower like normal and then
when I get all the shower my hair is so
soft like it's silk it's butter it feels
so good I'll have a link down to the
mess down below so my next tip for you
guys is I've been only washing my hair
twice a week I know that sounds gross
you're not very hygienic but I I mean
like a full shower but I just don't
shower my hair so I used to shower like
all the time when I was younger I don't
want something so weird that I don't
shower that much now but like you can
train so my hair would cuz my hair would
get so greasy like everyday and so I
reach our but you can almost train your
hair to not get as greasy so if you like
start off by instead of showering every
day like try every other day and then
just do like three times a week and then
two times a week and I think two times a
week is perfect but you can just train
your hair there's your shampoo there's
baby powder there's stuff till I fix the
greasiness in the meantime but I
definitely recommend doing this your
hair just feel so much healthier the
next thing that I do pretty often is
take these hairy nano gummy vitamins if
I'm completely honest I don't know if
this works but I do feel like my nails
at least feel a lot stronger
my hair does feel like it grows a little
bit faster my duty fees but they taste
really good too so that's a plus you can
find these at your local Costco for
$11.99 so you know what's lost him the
last thing that I do is I try not to use
heat because I like to keep my hair nice
I have super naturally straight hair and
it's actually really annoying because
they're just like no texture at all when
I want to have like crimpy or textured
hair I just braid my hair overnight also
a bonus tip is to use scrunchies instead
of is the microphone on a real quick
bonus tip is to use scrunchies instead
of rubber bands if you're able to
because like when I'm putting my hair in
a hotel or something and you put on like
a super tight rubber band it just like
squeezes your hair and it's not very
healthy and it also can make your head
hurt but when you use a scrunchie it's a
lot more gentle on your hair since it's
like looser and yeah I just it's like a
real quick tip I was reading a blog
about it and like it actually makes
sense so does your scrunchies instead
rubber bands
okay the first time I tried this stuff I
was like this doesn't even work what a
rip and then like ten seconds later my
lip started Philippines Lee and then
they really they looked a lot better in
my opinion and they look super hydrated
because this is a hydrating plumping one
if you're gonna get any of these like
lip care products get this one like I
really like it so I just put those on
when I'm doing my makeup and then it
kind just like sits in and then my lips
look better and more hydrated and fuller
and then this one right here I also like
to use in the morning towards the end of
me doing my makeup I like to apply this
one and it's revitalizing and tinting
and so it almost like it doesn't look
like a lip gloss but it does but it just
makes your lips look like they're
naturally this color which is really
cool all the links to all the products
down below so subscribe to my youtube
channel okay so for my skin I like to
keep it fairly simple or else if I have
a super long skincare routine I'm most
likely not gonna do it at night when I'm
super tired but this is what I've been
doing lately and I feel like it works
really well I know my skin's not perfect
in any way shape or form I do not have
Hayley's any skin by the way hey like
saying if you're watching this your skin
is so good I don't understand so what I
like to first do is take some coconut
oil and then I just rub this all over my
eye area to remove all just like my eye
makeup great okay so once I've rubbed in
the coconut oil and I look like I've
been having some thick tears the man I
just take a pump of this I put on there
and then I just rub it in my skin okay
so now I'm gonna go ahead and rinse this
off and I'll be back make sure I take a
clean towel because I feel like that's
also the victim of a lot of us is that
we're like cleaning our face but then we
use a dirty towel to wipe it off and
then it like so I always just like to
set aside to tell her something to use
for my face instead of my hands have a
hand towel and then a face towel really
extra but okay so I'm now a bare face
and what I like to do after I've
cleansed my face remove my makeup is to
atone it I feel like toning actually is
really important because it just kind of
like rebalances your skin this is the
one I've been using lately
pixee sent it to me and it says Marla on
it so it's really special but I mean you
don't have to have your name on one but
this is just the glow tonic and I feel
like this one works pretty well I know
there's something called a witch hazel
which I used to use all the time and
it's really cheap and it just hold up
Walmart so I would recommend that one to
really any toner I feel like will work
but I'm just using this one today but
like I just apply it especially in my
t-zone and on my nose sweet dreams till
sunbeams I'm very aware that the title
of this video is self-care routine this
is more like an external video like just
talking about your outward appearance so
I have a separate video just talking
about more like focusing on the inside
so all that link down below and yeah so
go watch if you want to boost your
confidence this video is not sponsored
it's a hundred percent everything I said
was my own opinion
I love these products so all of
everything link down below and thank you
