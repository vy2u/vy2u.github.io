gorgeous my covergirl and it's in the
pretty cheap drugstore brand that works
so isn't that amazing and I really like
it then I'm only not on my problem areas
traditionally the reason why people like
to use my foundation and maintain is
because it's so much lighter and also I
don't know where her is it's wrong but
it was like if you only put your like
consider on your poem areas and then you
just do that and makes your skin look
more naturally slow as compared to
putting on like a whole tartar like
layer of makeup you know what I don't
know that true now I'm just gonna go and
take my finger blood that out when you
smell the product I don't like to go
when I read you lender and do all that
so I feel eager to do ever you want no
or if you'd like to use like a brush I
have this one by else and I don't know
why that it works really well also I had
clearly three pimples up here overnight
like two days ago
all it in times of horrible Idaho Church
looking like I don't know it was
horrible
now I'm like looking into the camera and
I see that it looks like my eyes are so
instructor so I'm going to apply a Louis
Taylor also onto my eyes the whole time
this look is natural out but if you di
can see they're pretty much confuse all
the like bushes so for the solicitation
to supernatural I want natural girls
want glowy without looking like a teak
face so I'm going to be using more
orangey colored products I'm accustomed
to start by using the NYX cornica low
liquid illuminator and this is like
liquid highlight I really like this
product I'm a little gust go a long way
so be careful if you do get this they
don't squirt it all the time we're super
got onto my fingers miss can I like put
three dots in light like where I want to
be highlighted
and then I just going to take my finger
absolutely not a brush I'm going to take
a really fluffy brush it's by lucky and
three five one for blush brush I really
love this one super soft and I'm just
going to go and cut that out and blend
it in and I'm different committees i
fingered all subliminal now I'm going to
go in with my veneers cosmetic mineral
blush and it is called the autumn glow
I know we're going into spring but this
is a really pretty color trust me so
this is what the packaging looks like
upside down so now I'm going to go to
take this on some blush brush once again
and then apply that to my mind up I got
to my cheeks and also this part like a
little both of really long way now I'm
just going to go over the product and
brush it all over my face because it is
so dark that it could go as like a
bronzer then I'm going to make my final
bxq which is also and I'm going to throw
all over my face to it to hydrate
everything and then I'm going to go in
and since it was like a natural look I'm
going to do my eyebrows instead of a
pomade which can go on super dark and
super heavy and Ruby using a eyebrow
pencil so to give this little bad boy
and it's actually a brown eyeliner but
it matches my hair color and so going to
crank up this and then I'm more defining
my brows and my selenium or shaping them
I'm just like kind of make them Lubert
and records that way they stand out and
that going to take these nice good where
is it struggles of being a girl cuz
you're like let me do all your makeup
brushes and there
of the same and then I decided this out
with the end of this we brush and then
I'm going in with my essence mink me bro
and I'm going to go set my eyebrows
well my eyebrows looks really dark right
now it's okay that goes on so I was like
for some really dumb reason hashtag
Marlowe logic I was going to sell my dad
so I put all my makeup into this yellow
board ring so I don't get to transfer
that back into the garage is my favorite
eyeshadow and this little cut my bad boy
I didn't say fancy like I do not want
that boy see I'm grabbing mythos L more
it's more of a dense brush I forget
what's called bitumen Zig I'm just going
to go in and only set the places where I
get super oily
now I'm taking what do you know if you
watch new videos don't know I'm use this
in every major store but it's become so
good stick in the news dude makeup
palette the eyeshadow palette and I'm
going to be doing the color bitch no I'm
going to do flirty that's I'm going to
do I'm going to take the color flirty
it's this one right weird
it's a creamy color and then I'm going
to take the colors firm and goes this
one I hear it's right next to Ascot one
right there and then I'm going to be
putting this all over my lid on top and
then now I'm going to go in with a gel
eyeliner line my top off science that
makes your eyes kind of so much more
without doing my winged eyeliner
whatever now I've got a shadow I'm going
to go in with more highlighter because I
wanted to be very dewy and
natural-looking but I'm going to go in
with my classic Maybelline champagne
next is eyeshadow by use it as a
highlighter it is so good
and then I'm going to fight a little bit
my chin and all my nose look wet and I
like it and a little bit underneath my
brow brown so basically neural interface
and now I'm right back with my gel liner
and I'm just going to line the top of
the lash line so I'm not going to make
eyeline anything but it will make my
eyes pop out more so I'm going to get
real up close and personal with my
mirror and then says oh so I'll just
take your eyes pop a little bit more and
then but you're not like wearing like
extremely dry liner why wait well I
think your mascara botan so much better
I'm almost doing the dishes always two
degrees in the middle and I'm using the
usual Kika
I like Scarah go watch my other
tutorials if you want more deets on this
cuz it talked about every time and I was
like - I like one to two coats not too
insane not during the 100 coconuts Tara
challenge so it's makeup look isn't as
natural as I want it to look to be but
it's still kind of super cute and also
doesn't look like you're to the lake
cake face with the kind of makeup on it
still looks natural think is a liquid
illuminator hope so much like with that
inner glow look actually I think the
only hannover foundation is in my videos
because I hate wearing foundation every
day so this is more of what I do totally
feel shook so this is the we make look I
will be good like it and thanks for
watching to subscribe and interesting to
the end I'll see you in my next video
