a back-to-school drugstore everyday
makeup routine
so today may be evening brushes I got
from vanity planet so I know vanity
planet is it's an online store it is not
a dress store I have a 70% off code that
makes these brushes like 30 bucks a sink
and it's a 15 piece set so if you do the
math that that's like a really good
price for each brush and so that's
awesome in their sell-by quality and I
love them and I brought actually brought
these brushes to my Canada trip because
it's like also a Travel Pack and it was
so nice because they're all just in the
same place and they fit into a suitcase
perfectly and it was really great
the in brushes are super soft they're
vegan so cruelty free they don't shed so
that's awesome and they apply it makeup
super well so this is what it looks like
and for traveling this is perfect so it
comes with a side black like faux
leather things and you open it up and
you have a huge 15 piece set brush set
it looks nice it looks professional
looks like the stuff like the makeup
artist words like as a fanny pack
honestly they're all really good so so
be handled on the brushes are very nice
and they seem sturdy and it's like I
feel like these will last me a while and
make sure you guys check out the
description box there also have a 70%
off discount code 70% and these are also
honestly jeez you're so awesome so back
to school because I think everyone could
use a new set of brushes because we all
know Hungary ours are so if you guys
want to know how to achieve this super
affordable makeup look that I'm wearing
right now then keep on watching the
video so I'm not I'm going to be in the
9th grade which is I consider high
school but where I live it's stolen
middle school but it's like considered a
freshman this is going to be a direct
Dorian control and I'm really excited to
do this because I am taking is so
expensive the total of my purchases I
went with $40 it took 40 bucks for one
eyeshadow palette like on high-end so I
think that's a really good price headed
over to Walley world and I got some
dresser makeup so I'm gonna start off
with concealer I already do concealer
first before my like face makeup because
then I just need go to my natural are
only these managing planner brushes I
have used been trying out and I want to
like be able to use them like given
survey oh I love these specifically
Maybelline New York masters concealed
camouflaging concealer I have this in
the shaded light / medium and today I'm
using this concealer brush for them yeah
okay so I'm going to like clear up some
stuff right now I have a having so many
comments on likely to your video
especially you make how are you doing to
your school to your doing online school
like what's going on are you doing like
just stuff like that so to clarify I am
NOT going back to online school I'm
going back to public and that's why I'm
able to do cheer because I said an
element's go to one let me do that but
I've not been back to regular school or
public or whatever you want but um in
over a year so I hope I don't get
bullied
oh why would you guys like this I made
it myself okay so my concealers now is
done that and I'm going to go over with
my BB cream now I'm excited just even
cream it I actually used it click before
like this is not a first question this
is my all-time favorite being kundo so
I'm going to this is machine like a
medium because of man so I'm going to
make my foundation brush with them and
I'm going to apply that to my screen you
have seven minutes
so now I'm going to skim a cup is done
but I'm going to go in with bronzer I'm
actually excited to use this so normally
if I wanted on is looks so good but this
is a huge and it's by autumn oil it's
the color icon bronzer and it has SPF 15
in and which is cool and I don't know if
she'd be Shea take ticket to Brazil and
it's just like four bucks like if it's
good
this pond is Togo so I would actually
recommend this if you want like a cheap
but like decent bronzer result very
natural-looking not nothing too crazy
are going to who is a little bit dorky
it's going to school like that
so for blush you're using the Maybelline
fit me so this is in the shade pink rose
and I think spring so so actually mimics
little key brush under these it would be
another weird word cuckoo comment down
below your favorite youtubers because I
want to watch them this is a really
pretty part I actually like this I feel
like it's not I submitted as I would
want it to be you know for like five
bucks cause I just sleep a little blush
is kind of like all over that way to
look like not great like in gold you
know I think anyone knows it cuz I'm
going to do my eyebrows I'm so excited
for this I can't remember if it was Anna
can - or Rachel can - who mentioned it
but the elf gives broad pomade is the
lock on liner and bra cream I heard that
this is they said the system's look
really good and it's like really good do
to be honest I want my honest review
about it Pramod is like completely gone
the guy I'm kid you not it looks like
the call me like it there that looks
like the on Saudi account pomade so I
hope it works perfect the exact same
consistency we're going to so big that
day and so good ones up will this is
really good like really good oh my
goodness I'm so excited
do you know how much money I've been be
stating like a lot this is like oh my
gosh I'm so I'm
well boy is this you don't know this
tastes good
now I'm going to go set them but with
this I this slice this elf gel thing
I've used this before and I know it
works so like 2 bucks it usually dollar
but they raise their prices this is
pretty good so I was going to just show
you guys like the hairspray Harper use
like hairspray honestly and it works
just a Santa flying the better but it is
not so good as for quality this I don't
think they could be like a beauty like a
legit beauty guru because I like like I
feel like I am kind of like a beauty
guru but like I mean not a little wrong
well q-tips are a must for whenever you
do makeup so I'm going to go in with the
wet and wild color icon cool eyeliner
this is in a baby salt block and it's
just basically a gel eyeliner and I'm
going to put this on my water wash line
just to say guys it look a little bit
more dirt person yet you go and
hopefully don't do anything that's an
intense blob like that works well so I
totally recommend this if you guys are
in the market for a gel I just look what
to looks or was it like me success I
actually would totally recommend it and
it's so good I love finding like
drugstore products that work well
because you know there's much cheaper
than my client was and they were
thrilled so you also got me imagine
strong I don't know about you but there
are so many people that color is cool
like or I went to cause and they would
like wear false lashes like like
Instagram brows every day and I got four
points of light foundation which there's
nothing wrong with that but like I just
feel like first off you have to wake up
like a lot earlier to do that second off
like honestly
okay okay so now you the next tip is to
curl your eyelashes now this is the
covergirl LashBlast one and this is my
favorite it is so good I will never go
back to anything but I do want to try
out that one is by L'Oreal but they just
came out with want to click this bit do
for the toothpaste one this is okay I
don't think there's like one bad product
that I bought today like it they've all
worked great so and the vanity planet
Russians are really good like I highly
recommend them
okay so I think that wraps up this
tutorial it's very natural-looking I
would apply highlighter but I don't have
any jokes for ones and honestly I think
it oh no I'm not done I'm going to be
trying out this else on that magic miss
instead they guys are going for a more
matte look today but that's okay I hope
this works well I haven't heard anything
about it I just saw there and like all
it's a business so no way so I'm just
taking the smallest bit of the Revlon
Colorstay colorburst matte balm fitted
in the shade complex number 230 I'm just
applying a little bit cuz that I'm not
really a lipstick girl but it's a very
neutral color and I just look like a
little bit of it now finishing up this
makeup look I it was very simple it's a
lot it's like every other makeover
chance of different products you guys
asked for it and also you know it's cool
so I brought all of my products at the
drugstore but the the vending planet you
can order online but I got all them at
the at Walmart so very cheap very
affordable there's hoping to make up
cost like 40 bucks and that's a really
good price
I didn't najin my hair so well I
probably will end up just one of those
school Kolya always can be in a
scrunchie so that's not it but I hope
you guys enjoyed this video I'm sorry it
was kind of boring or you guys didn't
enjoy it so there's no cash back so no
returns that wasn't funny it was lame
game make this much watching hope you

next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
