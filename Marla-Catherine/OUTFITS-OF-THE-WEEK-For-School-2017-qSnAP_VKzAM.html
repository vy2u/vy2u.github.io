channel if you're new here subscribe
today's video is going to be a outfits
of the week 2017 cool edition you know
even though I don't wear public schools
God's will get dressed and this video is
a collab with my great YouTube friends
Tatiana boy hello Dorothy and Aloha Katy
and so you guys have no turn off the
trail will be down into description box
so check them out they also did some
awesome videos so guys and it looked
good so on Monday I wore this hangry
shirt from is awful and it's mood like
literally this is me on Monday I want to
eat everything and I paired it with
these acute high-waisted jeans also from
za Phil and they kind of flare out on
the back they're a little weird but
they're super comfy and stretchy so last
night I rolled up the bottom of my pants
and then I throw on some classic white
chucks and I don't even know if anyone
calls them trucks anymore but they're
white converse
Tuesday's outfit was more like old
school you know so this is a thrift find
and this is just it's just a cute kind
of Sahar desert themed shirt and I
paired it with some ripped jeans from
Aeropostale and then these really cute
sneakers are from shop mev and my hair
is just it might be this top knot and
then I'm wearing some glasses and I took
them up onto my shirt to make it look
more feminine to kind of look cool a
little Wednesday's outfit was a little
like you know moody or just like I saw
half the week to go so yeah it's like
all black all gone so I'm wearing some a
black ripped jeans and then IV super
cute also Doc Martens it firms awful and
they're just like this maroon colored
maroon red and then it my shirt is also
from shop and maybe super soft and it's
this embroidered rose which i think is
so pretty into so classic and my
favorite part about this shirt is the
bell sleeves they're so flowy and it
makes me feel like my new pajama top
now Thursday's outfit if you like feel
like it's the day before the Friday so I
know so I'm wearing something super
comfy and it's this classical white
v-neck from forever 21 and then it'd be
super weird at jeans that are not jeans
these super weird pants from the thrift
store and they're really good cuz if you
ate a lot that day don't worry you'll
still fun into them and my hair isn't
some super cute ones now Friday we're
pumping up our cool clothes so we got
this really retro jacket from forever 21
and it's super like rustic and I love it
super comfy also which is a plus and my
shirt is also from forever 21 and it's a
squad all over it then I heard that with
the same black jeans from Wednesday's
outfit and they're just ripped at the
knees and then since we're running into
the weekend no pun intended
I'm wearing my tennis shoes and there's
the classic of black and white Nikes
