filming a heati palm makeup look and no
I'm not going to prom but I'm still
coming out with a makeup look for you
guys because dedication basically this
is a look that I would be wearing to
prom if I was going but since I'm 14 you
know I just know I'm in junior high I'm
not going this video is in partner with
Sephora collection is if you guys didn't
already know I am a Sephora collection
ambassador for 2018 which is so excited
for me so I get a partner with them
throughout the year for when they come
out with new products so they came out
with a total of 90 cream lip stains and
hold on first off this packaging it's
literally a pizza box I came in at this
morning I like fit on the screen when I
opened it I was like wow that's like a
lot of lipstick and then each of these
have three layers of lipstick I'm just
mind-blowing by how many shades are hard
well commenting there are there's
literally a color for every mood you
have throughout the day so like if
you're like feeling angry there's some
fiery riots if you're feeling pretty
neutral there's some nudes like you
literally could put on anything there is
even black like I'm not even kidding
like straight-up black like if you're
really emo for a quick second put this
on there's definitely a shade for every
single one because there's 90 not
nineteen but ninety shades you really
won't need to like reapply or touch up
the lipstick throughout the day because
they are lip stains and so they last
longer like they said they are pizza
proof which is important for a girl like
me that loves pizza like a ate pizza
last night the lip stains are also
infused with avocado oil which helps to
keep your lips moisturize and they won't
feel like dry and crusty even though
they are matte lip stains if you guys
are not a big fan of matte lip stains
that they also have a satin and metallic
which is way cool there's literally so
many things you could do with these and
they're so affordable too if you guys
are interested in any of these lip
stands all have them a link down below
and without further ado let's get right
on into this makeup tutorial so I'm
starting off by putting up my hair
because I don't
okay so I just put up my hair into a low
ponytail just to get my hair out of my
face but I'm gonna start with some
moisturizer I'm using Sephora collection
rose moisturizing cream and this one
quenches and brightens your skin so I
really like this one and it smells so
good I think out of all of our
moisturizers this one's my favorite
because it smells really good so I do
know that this is a prom get ready with
me and I just want to put that out there
I am 14 and I'm not going to prom a lot
of my viewers are and so I'm just doing
a makeup tutorial for those of you that
are going this makeup tutorial is
something that I would do if I was going
to prom probably won't be going to prom
for another two years so just putting
that out there so you guys okay so my
skin is down moisturize and quenched and
brightened this is a Holy Grail not
gonna lie this literally works so well
my face is always so puffy especially in
the morning and so I use this and it's
just basically cooling water I don't
know how this works but it does and I
just put this underneath my eyes and any
where it really gets puffy so basically
everywhere like you put it underneath my
cheekbones - just like in my area and
then down my nose on the sides so now
I'm using my Sephora collection bright
future concealer this is my favorite
concealer they've come out with it's not
like really thick but it's not too loose
it's just not perfect like natural blend
I'm trying to make this makeup tutorial
more on the natural side cuz that's
something that I would want to wear
putting this on where it's red and where
I have any pimples or anything in the
store and then just a little bit
underneath my eyes I don't like to put
too much underneath my eyes because then
I feel like it looks really cakey and
I'm just gonna go in with my 8 fingers
and blend
and then whenever access I have on my
fingers I just put on my eyelids that
way it covers up the redness a little
bit more so it's no I'll blend it out
and I'm gonna go ahead and move on to
bronzer and blush so now I'm using my
heavenly duo the benefit hoola bronzer
and then the benefit dandelion I think
these go together so well okay there you
go I'm now gonna go ahead and use the
same brush for blush and I'm just I
don't want to like look like a Barbie
doll or like a doll but I want to have
very blushed cheeks almost like that
sunburnt look cuz I feel like that ties
in with the peachy eye makeup look I'm
going to be doing so okay so I've now
done up my face makeup in stuff like
that it's just very natural looking and
very lightweight that way I feel like
when you're dancing at prom you're not
feeling like your makeups sweating off
so the look I'm going for is a thicker
but fuller and natural looking brow
which I most like I do most of the time
but a little bit more intense since it
is prom you're me taking mark walks I
mean I'm taking lots of pictures so I'm
gonna go ahead and do my eyebrows now by
the way I dunno I kinda have a unibrow
like it's a monobrow or whatever and
also I don't care so no need to comment
about it like I like it like that so and
I'm going to be using my precisely by
brow pencil by benefit in the shade
number five this shade is a little bit
too dark for me because they were out of
stock with one that I needed
okay so now I'm gonna move on to the
actual eye makeup look and today I'm
going to be using the Too Faced peach
palette I just thought since I am doing
a peachy makeup look I should probably
use the peach palette I actually got
this recently and I love the way it
smells and I really really love the
colors so so I'm going to start off by
going in with the color white peach and
peaches and cream and I'm mixing this
okay and I'm mixing those two together
just to kind of create a base for my
show look and then I'm going to go in
with a little bit of just peachy and
then summer yum mixing those two
together and I'm gonna put that into my
crease
and then I'm going to take the color
Just Peachy and I'm gonna put that down
on my lower lash line and blend the two
together that's a really cute face and
then I'm gonna go in with my peach
palette again and I'm going to take
candied peach this super pink one right
here and I'm gonna pop it straight on to
the center of my lid and then I'm gonna
be taking the color bill lien bleep
Bellini lien II know I'm gonna be taking
the color Bellini and I'm gonna be
mixing it with lucious and I'm gonna put
that on the center of where I put the
candied peach color so like in the
center of the peach color okay so now I
have the peachy eye makeup look and I'm
gonna go ahead and define my eyes a
little bit more by taking my Sephora
collection retractable waterproof
eyeliner and this is in the shade number
10 Matt Brown slash black and I'm just
gonna pop this right on my waterline and
a little bit on my lower lash line and
now I'm going to go ahead and finish off
my eye makeup look by putting on some
mascara okay so now I'm gonna go ahead
with a little bit of eyeliner this is
not eyeliner I'm gonna go ahead with a
little bit of highlighter and this is
the Sephora collection golden hour which
is in the shade at dawn and it's really
pretty Goldy looking highlighter I like
this highlighter because it looks more
like an inner glow instead of I didn't
know I'm just I like more natural
looking highlighters and so I really
love this one and I'm gonna be wrapping
everything up together by using Sephora
collection and cream lip stain and shade
number 84 this is a super pretty peachy
berry color I really love the formula of
this lip stain because it's not drying
and it lasts all night and super silky
smooth and all that good stuff they're
super affordable they're only $14 which
is pretty cheap in my opinion for a
really decent quality lip stain so I'm
gonna focus this lip stain on to the
center of my lips so I know that looks
really weird but then I'm gonna take my
finger and blend it out well this is
actually such a pretty color and I'm
using my finger and not the director
applicator even though the applicator is
great I mean to my finger cuz it just is
a little bit more natural looking and I
want this to be a glossy look and so I'm
gonna be using just a basic clear lip
gloss and putting that over my lipstick
but that is it for today's makeup look I
hope you guys enjoyed at watching
