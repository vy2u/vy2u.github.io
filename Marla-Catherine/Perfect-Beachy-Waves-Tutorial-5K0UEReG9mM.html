in today's video is going to be how I
curl my hair I got a lot of requests for
this video on my Instagram Q&amp;amp;A so let's
just get right on into the video today
star wars kid milk fortune so first
thing you're going to need is a 1 inch
hot tools um curling barrel whoa away
from 430 degrees I'm going in the oven
Papa Murphy's is baked at 430 so first
up we're going to start off with the dry
shampoo so this is my kind of everyday
part and so I just can just kind of
spray it on there and then take my
fingers and kind of rub it in and then
after maybe that you kind of brush it
out and add a bonus tip this also gives
you some volume and texture to your hair
look even more like I'm not really great
so that I'm taking the brush and this is
really old brush but it works amazing
and I'm just going to kind of brush out
my hair to make sure it really got in
there all that dry shampoo to absorb the
oils
as you guys can see it's a Hot Tools one
inch clearance but I actually don't use
a cramp the cramp the clamp I just wrap
my hair around it take about one inch
sections
sufen yourself comfortable okay q3 hold
it for a long time until it gets really
crisp so you're going for that wavy look
and I toss it off to the back take your
next one-inch section and just as soon
as that thing pick up damn wrap my orbit
there's buddy
oh yeah whole fish balz done hold it Oh
little chick great speed we
it looks like a demented worm then do it
again
gosh peas and you want to be coming away
from your face so we're going to go
ahead and darks when she faced the iron
before there and then you're up the hair
round so seriously mom why do you buy
that so right after you let your hair
I'm like kind of sit for a few minutes
to let the curls fell and you can
hairspray it so then you're a boy you're
here to the front and kind of run your
fingers loosely through the hair I like
this just just separate them and and
give them more of that like I just went
to the beach Jeanette is naturally curly
penguin and then part where you would
normally part it and pull it all to the
front so this is how I achieved the
victoria secret time hair so thank you
