hey guys it is Maya and today we're
gonna be flowing qahal this video was in
partner with princess Polly which is
super cool because I wear their clothes
I've been wearing these clothes like
non-stop and I'm obsessed with them I
really really love their company so this
is way exciting for me I also have
discount code for you guys so that's
really nice it's just Kota Marla and you
can get 20% off the entire website they
also have it free shipping to the US for
orders over $70 if you guys are
interested in Eddings the parks that I
mentioned in the video or just in
princess Polly website I'll have a link
down to it in the description box so at
school my outfits have been slacking I
just I wake up later and later each day
and it's getting pretty tough I was like
I need something that I can just throw
on but still like looks cute so jump
suits and overalls have been that's been
my obsession lately so so this first
jump sue is maroon and grey plaid if
jump suit and it's super soft and it's
all just one piece like there's no
zippers or anything it's just you
literally throw it on this looks great
with just like a white t-shirt
underneath and it kind of gives me like
clueless vibes it looks like you're like
a little businesswoman and use like I
will go play it but I still look great I
can't rip off the tag I don't really
know if this is a jumpsuit or overalls
cuz it has like the overall look but it
fits like a jumpsuit does that make
sense
but it really really I'm upset I have
not worn these outside yet I really love
the brown and white stripes uh it's not
like train conductor but kind of but I
really really like it I feel like this
would be super cute with like a white
turtleneck almost and this next item is
a pair of overalls and these are just
classic like jean overalls which I have
a lots of skinny jean overalls but I
don't have just up here kinda like
straight legged boyfriend Jean like
something you can just casually go to
and you don't have to really like you
can't really overthink a pair of
overalls
when I ordered jeans online I'm always
afraid that they won't fit right and
these fit really well and so I'm really
excited about that
they're just legit plain mom jeans and I
really like the way that these fit
around my waist and these would also be
wake you I'm gonna be saying wake you
this these would be really stellar with
a pair of with Abell when I cuff these
jeans at the bottom I think they look
even cuter this is just another item
that you
really need out of your closet because
you never know you guys are always
asking me where I get my mom jeans or
where your fine good mom jeans I
normally find mine at the thrift store
but that's really annoying for you guys
because like you want to get a pair so
this place it definitely has awesome mom
jeans and you guys can go buy them since
they're online so go be twins and get
these I wore these pair of parents to
school and I wore it with the super soft
like turtleneck in a jacket and I got so
many compliments and I felt so comfy I
like how flowy these are they have just
once again that kind of plaid pattern so
this next shirt is well this is I think
like the only actual t-shirt I got from
them but I really like this it just says
oh baby and it's reminded me of the
movie baby driver and I really like that
movie it's kind of like a pinky Brown
which is different and I like it that
way I really like the texture of this
t-shirt and it's super soft and super
wearable and it definitely goes along
with a lot of items it is just white and
then like a simple color this is another
state-wide i'm i think everyone needs
and but this is a little flirty weight
like a little something extra it's not
necessarily a turtleneck but it's kind
of like a mock neck more anyway these
gold buttons I definitely think are just
the extra that makes this staple item
like that much cuter okay these jeans I
am so excited about this it's probably
the my favorite item out of the entire
haul he's probably the best wear mom
jeans I currently own I used to have a
really good pair of long jeans and then
the zipper broke on them and so I was
super bummed about that and that was a
while ago anyway but I got these and I'm
now obsessed it doesn't have ribs
necessarily but on the back like ankle
it does have a rib these pants look worn
but they're brand new but it's not like
a gross like like these are gonna fall
apart like they feel very sturdy but
they still have that cute kind of rugged
look to them it snowed a ton and so
there's a ton of snow blowers and
flowers outside so if you hear that I'm
very sorry the sig next item is a dress
and when I'm completely honest I wore
this item and then I was listening to
the ratatouille main main theme song and
I was like dancing in my room I was like
this is such a cute dress also kind of
reminds me of the one from lala land
that Emma Stone wears it's a super
pretty like mandarin orange almost type
color it's super long it's gonna be
perfect for the summer and it kind of
like ribbed at this like it's super
stretchy like the straps they tie
together so you can like adjust how
tight you want it to be or something
those TV super here with a good eye on
Jackie or just like a long-sleeve white
shirt I don't know so this item is the
denim jacket I was excited to get this
one because it's
just basic like there's nothing on it
and it's very loose feeling but it's
like that perfect oversized without
looking too big anyway and then I left
all this leaves on this one in the back
it has that it's like an also comfy I
don't know but I think it just adds to
the jacket it makes it look more put
together and I really like this once
again it's another state violin that I
think everyone needs in their closet I
wore this to school on Valentine's Day
and I felt so cute but like I really
felt like I had to pop it out for that
day it was my first time in a while
actually trying in my outfit like I
normally wake up too late to even care
but this time I actually woke up on time
and I was like you know I'm gonna wear
something cute I wore like a white
turtleneck and then I wore that jumpsuit
I love love love stripes so much
obviously if you like go to my Instagram
most of my outfits and white stripes so
these next pair of clothing items are
shoes and these are probably the cutest
her shoes are currently own it's almost
like a lavender pinky color but they're
just super cute and a very what's the
word for it I got a classic schoolgirl
type kind of shoe but they just have
that pink color which i think is so
pretty and I wear these for school and I
wore them with a sweatshirt like an
oversized sweatshirt and a pair of mom
jeans and I just feel like these ties
outfit together these made it look cute
I really love the style of these and I
just so the last but certainly not the
least item is this jacket and I am
excited for this jacket because I've
been wearing it so much it's actually
pretty oversized but I kind of like it
that way anyway I feel like I feel super
extra when I wear this but it's probably
one of the warmest jackets I own the
Emma Chamberlain poofy jacket I almost
want to call it with a teddy bear jacket
but I just kind of jumped on the trend
because I'm like why not since it's like
a neutral color I feel like this matches
with a lot of outfits that's it for

lot more cute items on the website too
