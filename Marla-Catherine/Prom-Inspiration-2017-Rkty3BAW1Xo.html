guys it's Marla and news video is prom
and so pointing i-16 so where else would
you want to get your advice club not
even allowed to go to prom 2016 no like
literally on my way song so disclaimer
I'm not ready to combine so can you
dress like it and act like it yeah this
is just what the inspiration I'm very
sure you've experienced that look you
guys can go it reasons really I give
this video a thumbs up can subscribe
right now and then you forfeit I don't
like you baby shower
to adjust collective will hover link
down below they let me use these yeses
for the videos and basically they just
ran out dresses and then you just paid a
watching presence of paint for the dress
and I am very aware that neither I'm
looking you tie if you go to the stores
but I'm just trying to fit out there you
guys should it totally rented dress
instead of putting a lot of money on
here all I going to wear one night so to
start off at this first makeup look is
I'm you're going to be using the Born
This Way Foundation and I love this one
it's so natural so light and I'm in the
color ivory and I hope to not be that
color by the time summer comes around
and then I'm going to be taking my naked
qualit and going to be using the color
half-baked and this is a very pretty
gold color that is perfect for this look
and I'm just gonna put that all over my
eyelid and then I take my honest idea
dip brow pomade in the color medium
brown I think it's called it and then I
just fill in my eyebrows and basically
this is a regular makeup routine but
when I apply it my eyelashes it becomes
boom you know
and then I like to apply bronzer and
blush and all that good stuff okay and
then I'm going to be applying my fake
lashes and these were I think are by r
del so my dress is some dress collective
and this is their very pretty red one
and it has the jewels on the top and
it's so pretty
and as you can see when you spin around
it is so so pretty
my hair is in a braided updo and it's
Pancake and I'm wearing these really
pretty ear fibers and I'm sorry it was
so bright outside so I can barely look
at the camera and so that's why I wasn't
so this next prom look is more of a
sixties style and I do the same exact
makeup except I add winged eyeliner this
dress is so pretty and so like this
plastic it has a train kinda it's more
of a low back and my hair is in a
vintage curls and a half of it is pinned
back with an eco-park this look is super
good especially if you want to like
especially if you want to stand out at
the dam you know this last look is super
like Black Swan inspired like if you've
seen that movie so I just applied a very
dark eye shadow I forget what it's
called but it's from The Naked palette
and I just used tape to make it that
sharp line and that's literally all I
did and then I was also wearing um I
office individuals the fake lash
individuals to make it more exaggerated
and then I put on some harsh contour
harsh which creates a lot more harsher
makeup and if you guys search a Black
Swan of the movie you can see that this
is what it was inspired by I stocked my
hair into a very tight bun and then I'm
wearing this super pretty lace although
it looks like a like something from Swan
Lake it was
pretty and I love the detailing on this
on the sleeves I love the high neck I
love the tulle skirt and I just
everything about this dress is so pretty
and I'm also wearing these super like
high platform shoes this look is very
very different from what people normally
wear the problems but if you want to go
for that then go ahead it is I think
it's so cool and so cute I've enjoyed
this video remember to give it a thumbs
up subscribe and I'm Annessa Louis
