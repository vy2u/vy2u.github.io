I'm gonna cry I pick a squash so um that
is my mom and why was I dressed up what

like had actually really long her like a
little longer than this but I have right
now and then I'm like you know what I
want to get a picky cut like those cuts
little ones like a boy but my mom was
like no and so I got halfway and I
chopped my hair after my chin had grown
out little but that was like the worst
decision of my life oh how I don't know
how lies I like my little sister's ages
