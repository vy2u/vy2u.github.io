so anyway so I just finished putting
down all of the little triangle Walter
calls and it's now so plain like I
didn't realize how plain my room like
how much like just those simple
triangles can change your room the only
things on my wall right now or are those
lights and then that hat chalkboard and
my calendar which is probably going to
be changed so I didn't really show you
guys over here yet like you walk in and
this is what you see in to the left
there's this wall and I just don't like
it like I just don't like what how it
turned out when I done it and so this is
my whiteboard I don't really like the
stain in the wood it's like a little too
orange for me and then those paintings I
don't know just anyway and then some
more paintings and then up here I have
just a bunch of prints and I still love
the prints I just don't like where they
are and then this is my really messy
closet like so now I am going to move
around my room and there's a few more
triangles like over there like a long
side of my bed but I need to move my bed
in order they get there so my first move
are in my room and then I'll finish
taking all the triangles
so the Walde calls are all now off but I
need to organize this and some more
stuff before I move my bed around so we
heard it huge like boo like a big like
crack and then I was like is that until
me and my sister go and we're like sure
to investigate and we found my little
sister kind of huddled in her room she
jumped on the bed and cracked her bed in
half so my mom's been like asking her so
much like mom please please please can I
get this new bed frame it's like I'm not
expensive I want it I know I just I
really wanted a batch but she says no
your bed friends perfectly fine like
don't waste it so now that my little
sister crackers I'm going to sell her
mind and then I could get the best room
I want so I'm really happy she does
better but
so if you guys are wondering this is the
name of my bed and that's what it's
going to look like think ahead was
really cute and it's called a frost and
it's not I can't speak Swedish so oh
well anyway so this is the color of the
wood I think it's so pretty
I'm so excited okay so it is now I think
like 1:30 something like that and we did
get the bed set up almost but we don't
have these original wooden slots are too
big for it so we'll have to go back to
Ikea and get oh hey guys it is so it is
5:10 so I might just go ahead and show
you guys what I did above my desk this
is what it looks like now instead of
having not horizontal like it's supposed
to be I made it vertical and I painted
it the rim of it white and then I
painted that one that one not on and so
all the paintings are done by me except
for that one that one's just a print and
then these over here are just little
buckets that I got for a dollar at Hobby
Lobby and then I put akia fake plants in
them hey guys it's Marla and it is
January 9th and I've been waiting for my
package to come though my triangle
decals are from urban actors on
backorder so I'm actually going for a
little bit longer but I texted came
today and I was opening it I remember
that I need to show you guys don't get
my address so yeah I ribbon it or it is
also the Urban Outfitters like like
December 31st and like that I'm
sometimes this is a cactus landscape of
tapestry and it's so cute

perfect size though I'm fully tell this
is huge ok I'm going to go hang it up

it's still January 9th but I just wanted
to kind of wrap up today I did clean my
room quite a bit but I'm somewhat done I
still have yet to I still have yet to do
this wall and it's just going to have a
bunch of those triangle decals but I
bought from Urban Outfitters but don't

bed and stay on my chemistry and I think
it looks really good I will shave it
just a little bit right now it looks
really cute like I'm really testified

wearing a ton of makeup a lot more than
usual anyway so I was not expecting my

product looks like with the wall this is
what it looks like I think it turned out
really cute hi guys it's Marla it is
January 14th and I just got the last
thing for my room at that I've been
needing to get and so I my dad is
building a shelf for me and I wanted I
was planning on blogging a Tweedy both
but I forgot to bring the blog camera so
to make noises so I got this document
for Christmas and it's been sitting in
one of those like regular black clips
that you can buy them in but I wanted to
repot it so I got this New York old girl
miracle-gro and his potting mix and it
is great for succulents so I'm going to
believe that and go ahead and do it so I
just repotted that into this really cute
mug that I got from at home and just has
the monogram m and it offers three books
and so that's what makes me like it even
more and I just reported it repotted it
and I think it's so cute
