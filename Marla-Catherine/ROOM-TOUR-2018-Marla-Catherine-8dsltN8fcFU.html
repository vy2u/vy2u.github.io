and today we're gonna be filming a room
tour you guys request this all the time
and I finally feel like my room is to a
place where like I like it so I'm happy
and I did a redoing my room video back
in the beginning of 2017 I think yeah
I've redone I kind of read it recently
so let's just get right on into it
so as soon as you walk in through my
door on the right of you you're gonna
see this is it's kind of like my
charging station this is where I put my
phone at night and that way after like
get up when my alarm goes off and then
you know but I have to cork boards these
are from Ikea they're like literally 10
bucks each so they're pretty cheap I
have this was it like a great gray like
a vine vine adds that little green touch
I was Santa Monica license plate from
one of those like gift shops in Santa
Monica
and then I have just some photos some
notes from viewers that gave it to me a
me and greets
so notes from viewers that give it to me
at meet and greets and I love them so
much and then just some other random
stuff that I don't know they're just I
have it there and then on here this is
like a cubical thing almost all my
friend toys from Ikea I had this and
then I have this I'm not very fancy I
don't use these type things but this is
from Sephora collection and when they
gave it to me and I just called some
jewelry and it and fun stuff like that
and then I have but my ear pods because
I like to workout with these and just
I'm not trying to flex but I have those
and I have them right there I have a
fake plant for my Kia and then this is
something that used to be my sister's
room but I kind of stole it from her but
it's just a really cute quote it's kind
of longer but I try to read it just
because it's a really good reminder and
and then I'm my phone and then inside
here I've some bins that they're also
funny cute full of just like extra
clothes that don't fit my closet or
other random stuff and then down here I
have some books and yearbooks and
journals and so kind of boring stuff but
it's essential to my room and then I
have my miniature backpack I'm not I'm
gonna stay because you guys always give
me hate because I say it wrong it's a
Swedish and I am NOT Swedish so I don't
know how pronounce it but I hang this on
the wall because it's pretty light and
then
whenever I need it I just grab it and
that I go cuz I like to use this as a
purse yeah it's also like a small item
so if I don't have it like where I can
see it they don't forget that I have it
then this is one of my favorite prints
my room it's a Polaroid wall I've been
wanting a Polaroid wall literally
forever but I've never gone around
either like buying a Polaroid camera or
polar films literally so expensive I
don't understand I think it's worth in
the long run because it's super cute and
then you have like physical copies of
your pictures you know and then down
here I have a I'm kind of weird because
I bought myself okay I was on Urban
Outfitters and they were having a sale
on this and I literally got this record
I think for like 15 bucks I don't even
have a record player but it's Billie
Irish I don't you wish I I wish I don't
even have a record player but one day
when I do I'll have a record and then I
have my guitar from my grandpa that's
really such a mental value to me he'd
give that to he literally gave it to me
yeah
because anyway my grandpa is so cute he
plays the guitar and that's like one of
his favorites and he gave it to me he's
like when I die I want you to like play
this all the time and so I play all the
time and then this is the car my parents
got for me for my for my Christmas for
Christmas and then I have my ukulele and
then I have my Alex choice from Ikea I
this is another thing I've been wanting
for so long so if you like every single
youtuber has them especially the big
ears and this has been so nice having to
put all my like extra Sephora collection
makeup in here or just extra makeup in
general but I know I'll use but like
don't need right now so that's what it's
full of in other skincare items too and
then on the top this is knotweed lotion
literally like my brother says that
every single time comes in but it's the
best smile English and you love response
the fresh coconut and watermelon and
then right next to it I have another
fake IKEA plant I how I have a one
living plant in my room is because I
always forget to water them and I you
would think that I would like remember
them since I love plants so much but
like but this one's fake it hangs over
and I really like that up above I have
my one living pan and then I have a few
fake plants they're kind of hidden but
like I just hang them I hung them from
just like a string and then a push pin
and then I have my birdie Marvel sorry
this really means a lot to me because I
know it's like branding elbow a lot of
people think it's white girl basic
because it kind of is basically alright
I always
a dream to model for them and then the
fact that they allowed me to not once
but twice I don't know I just thought
that was so cool and so I end up getting
one of those pretty little signs and I
just have in my room kind of almost as
like a reminder like keep on going with
your dreams can you never know what's
going to happen and then I have this
pegboard I got from Hobby Lobby I think
it has a one my favorite quotes in it
but don't make fun of me because some of
the letters are missing but I'll read it
it just says as we lose ourselves in the
service of others we discover our own
lives and our own happiness and said my
older Deidre moved war literally it's
supposed to be but I didn't have any so
I put it off like one of my favorite
parts of my room it was like 15 bucks
from Target and it's a lava lamp it's
still heating up right now but you have
to see this baby in action she works
really well this is my one my favorite
things in my entire room and then I have
this really cute monk from from origins
it's a skincare company they sent it
through a PR package and it came with it
and I've had ever since and I loved it
so much for my makeup brushes and then I
have another one and it's just clear
like a little bottle from Walmart and
then I have more makeup brushes in there
and then I have my perfumes and a face
facial like sprays this is like my
favorite perfume of all time it smells
like grapes but like in a really good
way not like they're like gross
Kaufman like cough medicine grape but
like yeah taste really taste it smells
really good mom and dad got me for
Christmas and I've actually really liked
having it I just have a lot of my like
nighttime stuff that I use so like Jesus
over here you know you do anything and
then I have a fake plant once again
hanging up above and I just attached it
to like the like the bar where your
curtain thing and then they says I
didn't really show but this is my desk
and it's right next my house doors I
haven't done a makeup collection because
I feel like I don't have an ID oh I
don't feel like my makeup clock she's
very special but I did organize it
recently and my eyeshadow palette my
skincare I make up like bronzer and
blush concealer eyebrow and then like
lip so I am really proud that I
organized this because you guys watching
my vlog channel you would know that I'm
literally still messy my room is never
clean so this is like a rare occasion
and then on the other one I have a
notebook for when I'm doing like math
homework some pens some like stickers
inside of like I'm saying like so much
well just some random knickknacks the
glasses that I never wear and
I don't even know why I got glasses and
then I have hi my vanity mirror and it
turns on where I know it's not plugged
in this is what I use like at 6:00 in
the morning when it's super dark and I
it's just like a Holy Grail this is from
Costco by the way cos hit up your local
Costco they have these and then I have
my eye home that I use to tell the time
and then it's also a Bluetooth speaker
which is way nice and so that's what I
use when I'm listening to music in the
room then I have my good old scotches I
like to read these at night or in the
morning but I always just have them by
my bed oh I can see them and remember to
do that and then I have oh wait and then
up above my entire windowsill is the is
it window sill above my window and then
above my window I have these stream
lights like their bulbs and I got them
from Walmart I believe and there were 15
bucks and that's not bad at all for like
some good light and they just add a
little cute touch she'd the room then
going from my desk to my bed this is my
bed and I Evan I got my full-size bed
about a year ago and I loved it so much
I then got also like one of those $50
memory foams things about is the best 50
bucks I've ever spent on anything it
makes my bed feel so comfy my bets read
is from Ikea and then these pillow gray
covers are from Urban Outfitters and
then I have my tapestry and I end up
putting my tapestry in the corner of my
room so it's like folded and I really
really like the way that this looks I
feel like it gives more dimension to it
and the reason why is because I didn't
have space for it on the wall anymore
but I still wanted to have it up so I
just put in the clamoring room I really
like it I like the way it looks and I
kind of like how everything is kind of
mismatched I feel like it makes it more
like not generic but where are you yeah
more me so and then I have right next to
my bed is this great wave painting and
then I have this oh by the way this was
you guys asked me whenever I've shown
this in anywhere you guys always ask me
where it's from I bought this at a local
like vinyl shop is it vinyl or venule so
many grammatical questions in this video
I got it from one of those record player
stores and it was literally ten bucks
I'm not even joking and I loved it so
much but I bet you find one on Amazon
and then I got this I don't know link it
down below for you this will do that for
you too much and then I got this what
they call a wall necklace
I don't know if I'm completely honest
it's very cheap it broke but I do like
how to pin it to the walls that way it
stayed I don't know if I would buy
another one for that price but it's cute
and it just adds that kind of gold
accent to the room and then my favorite
part of my entire die just spit that's
probably my favorite part of my entire
room is this neon sign and this is from
so this is from echo neon Studios they
basically hand make custom neon signs
you can literally do your own
handwriting and then write whatever you
want and they'll make it into a neon
sign so this is not sponsored but they
did send it to me for free and I I've
just been amazed by the quality of it it
works really well my dad set it up and
wasn't even that hard to like do so I
was with him and I was helping him
because you know but thanks dad for
setting it up but I loved it so much
I chose out this one of the fonts that
was on the websites I thought I was cute
basically it's from a quote by Gordon B
Hinckley and it's just talking about
like standing tall and the shape of like
just be confident stand tall like I'm
gonna put this quote I'm gonna put the
quote up on screen so that way you guys
get it but stand tall it's just a really
good reminder for me I like to have my
room full of reminders because this is
my environment and this is where I want
to like feel like it's a good space and
it's good for me to be in and then I
have my mirror this is where I cry
because I'm like dang I'm not like I got
to use every day it's from Ikea it's
just one of those wall mirrors hey you
know that I have my closet and right
next to my closet I have my backpack
that I use literally every day I do have
some fairy lights around my closet I
think those are cute leave us out a
little basically when I was in st.
George they didn't have any other
Polaroid film inside of Walmart besides
the rainbow so I just bought it and I
really loved it I think it's just cute
adds a little bit of color into the room
and it just has Polaroids are so cute
they feel like they're just so candid
and so I don't even know how to explain
it but I really love them and then I
have a fanny pack that I use pretty
often and then a purse that's more
decorative it's not very practical but
it's very cute and then I have my this
used to say subscribe believe it or not
and over time some little elf is
literally snatching the letters out of
my wall I don't even know where they're
going but so please UPS and then above
my shelf I have random stuff it still
needs to be organized a little
but has a plan like my wallet just some
other little pants some pencils and then
it has this Ola sign I am Latino I'm a
quarter Latino I don't know if you knew
that but I am I'm very white this is
kind of like flying apart but it's just
some of my everyday shoes that I wear on
the daily Thank You slides forget socks
tennis shoes offer them some overview
shots of my entire room and that will
insert them because I think that's one
of my biggest pet peeves is when people
fill my room tour but they don't do an
overview shot because it's like I don't
even I know what that corner of your
room looks like but I don't know what
your actual room looks like so I'll try
to do that if you guys did like this
video then I give it a thumbs up and
subscribe if you want to and yeah by the
way this sweater is from UNIF I am
obsessed with it if you guys do you want
me to film a backpack tour then let me
know in the comment section down below
because I do use my backpack a lot and
so you guys maybe one tour of it so
thank you guys for watching I'll see you
guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
