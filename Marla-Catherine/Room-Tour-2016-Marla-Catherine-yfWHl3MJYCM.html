I'm so excited like so pumped so excited
to share with you guys at my room I have
not shown it to you guys that and so I'm
super excited we moved recently and so I
finally have my own room very grateful
and so I was able to decorate it the way
that I want you and now it's done and
I'm pretty sure another room tour will
be happening sometime soon so I'm always
changing things up love you guys let's
get into the video so it's our bedroom
you're going to walk in right now you
just walk into the you just walk into at
my room so up on your left so when you
walk in the first thing that you're
going to on your left is going to be
this cutest little stands that I got
from the copper life on instrument their
company is just trying out but they're
so it's so high-quality like I've
dropped this thing like so many times
when I was trying to move around my room
and it's still holding up great and it's
so cute and on hey I have just a little
plant from Ikea it's fake because I can
only keep things alive and then this
little painting that I did and unalarmed
clock I actually need a good a new one
and my paintbrushes and up above it is
this these two paintings that I did and
yeah because come look at that and then
we have my whiteboard that basically is
just like almost social media to do with
just reminders and then I have three
canvases that are like a world map from
Ikea super cute and they're only like 15
bucks for all three of them and then I
have the Sun Hat that I got from forever
21 that I actually showed it at my
forever 21 hole or not my Black Friday
haul and then I have this at sign that I
got for eight bucks at Hobby Lobby it
was on sale and I was like heck yeah
yeah moving on it we have my closet and
our
I'm gonna just it's so scary in there
and don't tell my mom that she thinks
it's clean though um this is my closet
and it's just like actually like half my
clothes the other half are downstairs in
the basement on clothing marks because a
lot of us clothes that I get from my
company's company companies I love to
wear but I can't put them in here so
these are like my basic necessity
clothes and then like the photoshoot
ones are downstairs and I need organize
these these are supposed to be like
pajamas in like random stuff but there's
a few other things up there and then
down here supposed to be shoes but I
have to time I get a little lazy and I
don't hang up the stuff so yeah and it's
actually this closet is a lot smaller
than my other one my other ones a lot
deeper and I just have more clothing
space if you know what I mean and it
also had another shelf and so me mine
sister shared that cause that we could
for everything fine but yes favoriting
now moving or don't we have at my
trashcan friends so we have my trash pan
and then my desk so in my desk
it is not organized but like it's messy
but I kind of know where everything is
this is my random drawer that is crazy
and I under here is just like more
random stuff
honestly I don't judge me because I just
move here and I've yet to organize all
that and then this is all just makeup so
I got this a desk from Ikea and is I
want especially my sister's and she
ordered it in all white but a k1 black
and white we just don't want to return
it so anyway so I thought of painting it
eventually but for now it's all have to
do and up on my desk I have just this
little antique whatever tray and has to
fake pens from Ikea a Christmas statue
and then I little um what I think is
called a candle that I'm not allowed to
light but they it's a little candle from
the copper life again and if I you can
they're so like strongly fragrance that
you can smell them without
them and that one's baked apple and it's
also good and out of my desk I have
these lights they're actually I've had a
lot of friends that convert be like whoa
like how'd you do that and honestly
they're just white Christmas lights from
Walmart then I like three bucks and I
got three of those and then if you
probably can't see them because we put
white stickers over the thumb text but
you just play the thumb tracks and hang
your lights and it's super easy to
perceive this is like ten bucks to do
and I thought it's okay so I just put it
in that is good to go moving on over
here we have just like an empty square
space that I don't - yeah I kind of want
to get a stand up body mirror but then
at the same time I kind of like it how
it's open but yeah so this is the corner
so on this wall actually if you watched
my room decor video yes I've room decor
video go check it out link below oh my I
made it these wall decals and I just put
them on at my wall as you can tell and
my brother thinks they look like neon
Brown burritos so see that we have the
super hugh shearer curtains and i blind
so i didn't really care whether the
curtains like what color they were but
my mom ordered these for me and i they
turned out so cute my mom actually has a
vlogging channel and i'll link that down
below
she loves daily so you got to see like
another perspective of my life so if you
guys want to see that go check it out
she it's called the seven Henry's and
then moving on we have at my bed so my
bed isn't like I think specially it's
from the bunk bed in my old house and we
just disassembled it but anyway so it's
just this white frame and then I video I
pillows and I am ESMA my bed I have
these DIY pills that I made and I need
to iron this without wrinkle again and
the pom pom pillow these again the room
decor video you guys can go check it out
and see how I made those now I have just
two white pillows in the back in my body
pull but I cannot sleep without good old
feel you're just kidding I met I didn't
mean I don't mean my
and then I a my lamp that I just use and
when I made that night from Ikea its
white just like me mastering and no it's
not and up above my bed is on these cute
little sayings so it's be natural leaf
and I have nothing to wear that is look
during school at least when I went to
public school like every morning I'd
open up my closet is like and nothing to
wear it started a boring like the same
outfit to school every day and then it's
be nice relieved because I don't think
notice but there's a few plates around
the room so I thought that was kind of
cute like the leaf theme like plan and
then I have this DIY calendar that we
made and it's just says December because
you're probably going to be watching
this in December or something that and
at least cute too prints the bean

have my textbooks for school and then my
random books and these are journals and
these are magazines and my Black Friday
haul in the background I had a map with
some lights strung across it that map
was actually sent to me through my the
schooling that I do it's like
state-funded and so they send us I only
supplies and they sent me two large maps
like me expect me and in fact and I also
I just wanted to quickly tell you guys a
little fun fact this is my dream journal
like not dream journal but like actually
like when I have a dream I like to wake
up and then like quickly write it down
that way you can remember it sometimes
and then on top of here by the way
copper life is so like I was only expect
that little I wasn't expecting anything
but she's really kind enough to send me
that little desk or what does that call
a stand and she also sent the candles
and also she said this little like iPad
stay on I don't have an iPad but this is
also great for if I have artwork I like
to display it here like my canvases and
then I have this cute plant fake once
again then another candle and this is
pumpkin pie scented smells great and
then this one is just a quote and it's
like just basically saying how to be a
better healthier and healthier human
being and that tells you how to so

nightlight because its motion sensored
and this thing has helped me out so much
