welcome back to my channel and this
video is going to be me recreating one
of Sabrina carpenters makeup looks
anyway so let's just get into the video
so to start off this makeup look I have
a fresh base nothing on and I'm going to
be recreating this picture will insert
it but you guys can kind of see right
here so this is the picture that we're
recreating so I've been looking at a lot
of pictures of Sabrina carpenter and I
notice that in almost all of them she
has like a high coverage foundation on
but it looks natural natural it looks
natural though so I obviously have to go
with the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation because it's very
natural-looking but it's still high
coverage so now that I have put on my
foundation and I'm done blending it out
I'm going to move on to like the she has
like a really bronzed cheekbone but it
looks like she didn't focus too much on
her drawing or forehead it's more like
the just to the cheekbone alright so I
obviously have to use the ELA bronzer
because this is my favorite one of all
time even though I haven't used that
many I'm just know it's my favorite and
she seems it looks like she doesn't have
a good defined like a really really
sharp it's really blended out in so I'm
gonna make sure I am blending it just
like shield you know and then now I'm
going to move on to doing my eyebrows
well it looks like she's a little bit on
her nose I'm gonna go in and do I know
two very very lightly but it does look
like she's a little bit of product on
her nose so I'm all my brushes are only
now and just smaller nostrils than me so
I'm gonna kind of try to like I don't
know how to I don't know how to do it so
I'm just gonna do my own thing
give me my nostrils like bigger if
anything on so now for my brows I'm just
using Anastasia in the shade and soft
brown I think that's the perfect shade
IDK so now that I've done my brows I'm
going to go and brush them up because
that's what Sabrina carpenter does now
okay so now I finished my eyebrows look
they literally
seemed like so in the photo she does not
have winged eyeliner on but she has like
that it looks like we died on her
because she put the tape anyway so I'm
going to recreate that with just some
clear tape probably from the dollar
store the easiest way to find where like
your winged eyeliner will look best on
your eye is to just follow your bottom
lash line and go dies and we'pon are
going on with this super fluffy brush
and this is the crown brush this see for
once you deluxe pleaded crease and just
a little bit of product and put that all
over like my lid and crease I don't know
what I'm talking about okay so now I
have made the red the base color and I'm
going to go in with the naked by Urban
Decay palette it looks like she is on
that I shot him on I'm gonna be using
the color book and then I'm just gonna
put that all over in the red now I'm
going to go in with a darker color so
I'm going to be using creep and I'm
going to go in a v-formation
around like right here you know I don't
know if that's called looks like your
squid Brown mess now I'm going to go and
blend it out and do the other eyes we
really know I'm not done looks which is
orange blended out so I'm going to take
go back with this like autumn blush
thing but it Bella puree and I'm gonna
just use some that now I'm gonna rip off
the tape
oh he's I turned out really good now I
gotta go do the other eye I was noticing
she has stuff on her bottom lash line so
I'm going to go in with a little bit
more of that red shadow and just put a
little bit on my bottom lash line
now right now I'm just curling my
eyelashes because my natural lashes are
straight and she has curly ones in the
bottom I'm now taking the kitty cat I
want to proof mascara by covergirl and
this is not my favorite mascara but it's
pretty good so now for I'm all done with
my face now I've seen everyone - lips
and she really doesn't have too much on
her lips it looks like she just put on
some chapstick and then like had a nude
orangish color so I'm going to go and
put on this chapstick and now just I'm
going to add some final touches so it
looks like she is a little bit not too
much still of highlighters I'm going to
use that same very very low-quality one
from Mars that I did in my glossy
eyelids tutorial and a lot of you guys
like this I'm gonna use again but I'm
just gonna put a little bit she looks
like she's like focusing right here on
it so I'm going to do that it's probably
the best hardware I have this is like a
dollar and that is it for this makeup
look and I think it turned out pretty
good
