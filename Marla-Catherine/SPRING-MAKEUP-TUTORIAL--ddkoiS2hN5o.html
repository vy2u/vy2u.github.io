and if you new here go subscribe right
now pause the video and go subscribe PS
it's free and today's video is going to
be a bring makeup look and this video is
also a club with Tatiana Boyd hello my
name is Tatiana Boyd and I see but it's
probably know already Lara and I are
doing a club I will be doing a room tour
on my channel don't forget to check out
my video right after Marla's and I will
see you guys a little bit peace
so first off I'm going to be using this
tinted moisturizer mode waist or ad it's
the mineral tinted cream and it's also
like what is it called a sunscreen so
that's good I'm just going to put that
all over my face and my strikes so it's
not bad right well I put on the wall
because I'm gonna be extra oily today
have any guys watch that thing on Ellen
okay today I was talking about Ellen
hold on before I tell you about Ellen
today I was talking about Ellen one of
the kids cyclists he said you watch
Ellen only through your woman watch
Ellen I was like lies but I'm just like
dude it's really right now where did I
watch Ellen after us rides you can cry
but I don't I don't find I literally
broke out everywhere this morning and
it's a little gross and so at school all
I know is concealer so you would only
imagine what that looks like so much I
read Crayola markers but all over my
face um so after that I like to take my
so normal but it's not normal
read wonder did you even wet it
mirlitons on my heart Beauty Blender
comment below if you wet your Beauty
Blender thank you it like what's the
point
it stays damp if you keep it in the
drawer locked up that's how girls mold
I'm gonna go fund this head now and I
like he's a stippling motion if it
didn't come sick I start talking to this
one kid she said to me buddy so I was
laughing but then I need to cough but I
tried to say something all the same time
but God didn't I thought well kind of
spit on
okay and then you can put a few dots
underneath your eyes if you have dark
circles because you stayed up potting or
reading like me until like midnight and
also if you do not have a Beautyblender
in your book you can just use your
fingers for your whole face but for
underneath your eyes you use your fourth
year anyway after blending all that
stuff out I'm going to move on to blush
and bronzer so I like to bronze Burress
and I went to Sephora and I asked them
how you're supposed to bronze this is by
the way this angle it up but it's the
pixie bronzer and it's in the shade
summertime and most of the time I'm
really honestly I'm not going to
contouring at all so I own these rods
are just to put some color in my face
because I literally look like Edward
from Twilight and so yeah so I she says
to squeeze this is an angle be lush and
beauty brush and you're just going to
kind of squeeze it and put it into your
bronzer and then she said you can either
suck in and then put it on or you can
this is your contour bone your contour
along your cheek bone and I go right
underneath it and put it there do it an
upward motion yeah I need to blend that
out and you got some color you can put
some on your jaw line the excess around
some up here
okay yeah I'm going to take my
Maybelline Dream bouncy blush and I am
going to put that on the apples of my
cheek cheeks and a little bit above
where I put the bronzer anyway I just
take that I like to put it smile and I
have cute my fingers so I this is a dupe
of the Naked palette I think I can need
more than Naked palette too so I'm
taking the Urban Decay and Eden and I'm
just in a little bit and I want to put
this on my lid so every day I literally
have the greasiest eyelids in the world
you guys peridot some peaches by the
Bell
it's really good to listen to you in the
car especially on road trips because
then you feel like you're never
anyway nobody is all blended out and we
can move on to eyeshadow to first start
off our makeup look I'm going to take
this kind of nude skin colored one right
here and I'm just going to put this all
on my lids Oh a lot done that is a lot
oh well because you're going with this
today I'm not gonna show at all does
that look good
I'm taking the on estancia dip brow
pomade in medium brown and I'm just say
I've started out the watch is gone and
then I'm going to go on to the other I
go and I have to brush it off and glam
to the other body row and she's deep and
now you've got to seal up your brows and
so they do not move throughout the day
and I know a tip for you guys you can
take this is literally the elf clear
brow mascara and then go buy a can of
the got she glued glassy pretty straight
and your brows will stay in all day
I'm taking my shishito I think I'm
saying that right shadow shishito future
self and then I'm taking my last
sensational full fan effect waterproof
and the reason why I use waterproof you
might already know this but waterproof
is NATO's oil and so it keeps your
eyelashes curlier in the water and it
last but not least is your lips I
normally don't wear anything but if I
ever went or anything is going to be a
lip stain because it doesn't look like
anything but it looks like you're
wearing something this is the benefit
Wallington I'm almost out of it and I
want to get more but it's just a pretty
color it's again like the purple color
with all that you can rub it with your
finger or do everyone that's it for this
makeup look thank you for watching
Gruber to give this video a big thumbs
up and go check out Tatiana
Boyd channel she makes amazing videos
