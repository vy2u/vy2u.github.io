and you know you know I like them I
think they're cute so anyway let's get
started so starting off I have the super
cute outfit I love this one it kind of
looks like a farmer girl but that's
alright so my denim overalls or Shore
dolls are from the thrift store and then
I have my brandy melville crop t-shirt I
like to wear the quad t-shirts like with
something and then I'm wearing some of a
yellow vans which I think are so cute
they just add a pop of color and then a
hair scarf and I am so obsessed and then
this next outfit looks like so cute for
a picnic or something the shirt I'm
wearing is from Urban Outfitters and it
has the cutest ever like there's flowers
and then I'm wearing these pants from
brandy melville and they have like I
don't know if you would call it gingka
or you'd call it checkered but it's not
and then I have this purse from princess
Polly stop very practical but it
definitely is super cute now this next
outfit is one of my favorites it's just
very I don't know how to explain it it
kind of looks like you're going to rodeo
I've never been to rodeo but it kind of
look like that H&amp;amp;M t-shirt I got for
like 6 bucks it's so cute it's just kind
of reminds me of Where's Waldo and then
I have some red converse on there a high
top I love high top converse so much
this next outfit definitely looks like
I'm running errands and I'm eating an
otter pop - so my shirt is from in and
out and you can buy it at in and out and
it's like literally 12 bucks and I love
the back of it too and then I'm wearing
some denim shorts from brandy melville I
probably over wear these but I love them
and then I'm wearing a like train
conductor hat from forever 21 I believe
and it was like 13 bucks and then I'm
wearing some Birkenstocks which isn't
that big of a shocker because they wear
them almost everywhere yeah those are my
outfits of the week I hope you guys
