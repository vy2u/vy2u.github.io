gonna be doing a school morning routine
and I'm super excited bout this video
because I found it a different way it
was more like vlog style but I liked it
and I hope you guys enjoy it too I also
want to say huge shout out to
Squarespace for sponsoring this video if

is awesome if you guys want to hear more
about that you know stated that into the
video I'll talk about it a little bit
more and there will also be more
information in the description box below
so without further ado let's get right
on into this morning routine start my
morning I am very lazy like I always
sleep in 40 minutes past I'm supposed to
but I cannot help it I don't know what's
wrong with me but I always like to
stretch take my time right as I get out
of bed I go and I turn off my alarm and
I know my phone says it's 3:17 p.m. I
did not film this in the morning I fell
in this an afternoon except the only
time I had so I'm very sorry but I go
over to the bathroom and this is what I
look like in the morning it's actually a
problem I'm trying I'm just I'm trying
guys I head on over to the bathroom and
I do all the bathroom stuff like
brushing your teeth looking at yourself
go to the bathroom what do you even do
the bathroom yeah anyway so I do my hair
basically I just brush it no I lied I
don't rush it I put my hair in a
headband and I wash my face if I do not
wash my face I feel so gross and so I
always have to do that and also kind of
just like wakes me up and I dance even
though there's literally no music
playing I just anyway so after I am done
with the bathroom normally I turn on
like an LDS talk or something or if I
took more relaxed morning I turn on
Spotify and my Spotify is underscore my
Katherine by the way you know
I then do my hair so my hair is a legit
struggle every single time I do it just
doesn't turn out if someone could help
that'd be very appreciated so I normally
put my hair either in like a low
ponytail which I didn't what am I
getting ready with me and to show you
guys how to do that
but today I straightened it all so if
you guys have had any tips on how to
like keep your hair looking silky like
throughout the day cuz my hair like
always gets stringy by the end of the
day I just don't it's a problem
so after I do my hair I go and I do my
makeup I don't really wear much makeup
to school just because I don't I touched
my face a lot during school I just don't
want to deal with it so I just do my
everyday makeup routine which is pretty
natural looking and I put on bronzer
just filling my brows a little bit and
pro mascara and that's literally it
I'll have a link down below to my
everyday makeup routine if you guys want
to go check that out
the most stressful part of the morning
is choosing out my outfit it's a legit
struggle it's it's really hard for me to
do I end up regretting what I'm wearing
halfway through the day so my outfit of
the day is a black and maroon a
turtleneck sweater and it's really cute
and it's thrifted so that's great and
then my pants were from brandy melville
which is not a shocker but they have
really cute and comfortable stuff so I
can't help it and for my shoes I can
without a doubt I always wear my
converse I just they match everything
and so they're really easy to put on so
I always wear my converse most of the
time and yeah by the way if you guys
notice me maybe you notice but the
camera quality is a little bit different
because I'm filming on my vlog camera
that I just purchased and I've been
vlogging a lot more so if you guys want
to you can go check out my vlog channel
and go check that out subscribe
and then I go and I eat breakfast and
for breakfast I normally am in such a
rush so I try to pick out things that
are normally easy to make like oatmeal
these protein shakes like the premier
protein ones they're so good and then I
head out the door and I know the screen
says walking into school I do not walk
to school but I walked to the car to go
to school and so cuz my friend gives me
a ride but anyway that's about it for
