me here's a beam so much today
oh you somewhere there's from the
music video I've been watch
let's make jess.joy together they can
destroy ya hey guys it is Maya and today

productive school night routine today's

by the way this background is for an
upcoming video thankfully this takes me
now without further ado let's get right
on into the night routine so once I get
home from school I like to I don't know
like rest for a few minutes cuz school
is tough but then I like to start to do
my homework I was gone for entire week
of school and so my grades completely
dropped to D's and F's and I was like yo
diet my mom probably would not like guys
so I'm trying to get my grades back up
currently most the time I end up online
shopping and that is not good and after
doing that I'd go ahead and do my like
Instagram and YouTube stuff so I work on
videos work on Instagram posts and stuff
like that
and then after doing that I'm really
exhausted so I like to go ahead and feed
my fuel is that a thing anyway so I like
to go ahead and try to figure out what
I'm I eat well imma eat okay I like to
go ahead and try to figure out what I'm
gonna eat that night I ate chick-fil-a
and after doing that I go ahead and I
clean my room
my room is a 24-9 messy like a 25/8
anyway i normally like to listen to
music but lately I've been loving
listening to books on audio and I've
been using audible audible has the
largest collection of audiobooks they
have a very wide range from like fiction
to comedy and everything in between it's
awesome if you want to read more books
but you don't have enough time to like
sit down and like we actually read it
but if you're listening to it on audio
you can like multitask and it's awesome
and you still get to read an awesome
book currently I'm reading The Outsiders
by se Hinton and I really really love
this book it's just it's one of the
classics I mean it's one of my favorites
anyway also he's a cute shot of my
polaroid wall after doing so I like to
go ahead and it's tend to work out when
I say attempt like I mean attempt like I
suck at working out but I try so I was
actually a fake fan I didn't even work
out this video I was pretending but most
of the time I do and I just do it to it
stay healthy okay so after I'm done it's
normally like almost 8 o'clock or
something of that sort so I go ahead and
I start to get ready for bed so I do the
basics like brushing my teeth doing my
skincare routine and stuff like that you
guys already another drill and then I
choose my pajamas I most of the time
wear legs in a shirt and I also wear
leggings and shirts to school most the
time so if I'm completely honest I'm
always wearing my pajamas I will then I
go into my phone and I do the classic
stuff and I just going to Instagram read
my scriptures and then I hit the hay
thank you guys so much watching today's
video I hope you enjoyed it if you did

that's about it I'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
