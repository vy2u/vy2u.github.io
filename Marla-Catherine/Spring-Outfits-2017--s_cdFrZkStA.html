thrifted and that tourist inspired so
make sure is from it for over 21 and it
says on vaycay and has a little palm
tree and it's very comfortable and that
my jeans are from the thirst or their
mom jeans their mom jeans and I got them
for like 10 bucks so yo my shoes are
these pointy flats and they're from
forever 21 and my hat is also from
forever 21 and the bracelet I'm wearing
I forgot to show it but bracelet I'm
wearing is for my fabfitfun
box I can't think of the neighborhood
right now this Alva is perfect for when
you're like walking in the city can you
look like the tourist even though it's
your homeland this is another way I
styled my mom jeans and so I'm wearing
another forever 21 t-shirt so let the
good times roll and it's just like
mustard color or I get with some white
high-top cumber converse converse my
jeans and these vintage sunglasses
I really like this color but I cannot
tell if it's orange or a dark yellow so
comment down below if you think it's an
orange or a dark yellow
this next outfit is like I ran away from
the farm and this is what I was wearing
and so I am wearing overalls from duffel
and I stuffed some flowers that I
wildflowers that I found on the side of
the road in the pocket and half of them
were falling out it's okay and I got my
shirt from the thrift store for like two
bucks which is awesome and then I'm
wearing some Dita's holographic
Superstars and be see-through socks
that I got from forever 21 which were
like three bucks but I think they're so
cool and they add to the look so it's
the last outfit is kind of like I want
to be my grandma so I'm wearing the same
socks I wore in the last off it with
some Jesus sandals a denim skirt from a
denim skirt from Old Navy and at this
super grandma ish top from v store and
I'm eating ice cream because what else
would you expect me to do that's insane</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
