up to my channel today's video is
interest hall I've been obsessed with
strip shopping lately
and I recently discovered a news to
restore that it's actually pretty close
to my house so it so excited and it was
so successful stay tuned for the end of
the video because I'm going to be
showing some clips of me being
photographed wearing these clothes kind
of hype specifically went to the store
and post of finding clothes for the
upcoming shoot I'm going on and so I
also may be sharing some clips from Knox
so first things first is this shirt I
bought it from the store for score
dollars that's eight four four dollars
and it is the cutest thing ever it is
just a very bohemian embroidered very
nice material the material is so thick
and so just soft and nice and it has a
bordered a little stuff on the sleeves
and it flowers on the on the chest part
really like this year and in fact it was
$4 makes it even cuter yeah next sure it
is super like 50s 60s kind of like um
what's in that movie all insert the name
of the right here to the can't remember
it but it's super like Wes Anderson
inspired which I still love of it a tank
top and I think for like after you go to
the pool and you just want to run
something super cute or just when it's
blazing hot during the summer this will
be so cute it's just a pastel yellow
with white trimming on the shoulders and
also the super cute white line up collar
this is the cutest thing ever and and
what made me like mind-blowing about the
shirt is asarco's
$2 where are you where are you find
something like this for two dollars
literally I used to hate for shopping
and so it's so funny how like obsessed
but now I you think you know other
people on it and I'm like nah I think
it's cool like it has a story before you
owned it so this next shirt I'm super
excited to share is kind of not my usual
this looks like a carnival shirt and it
is so cute it has a little color and
it's like not red but it's not pink it's
like a salmon colored striped and when I
showed my dad and my brother this they
said the exact same thing and they're
like right have served me popcorn and I
was leaving honey and this was three
bucks
so three dollars I'm silver silver I'm
super excited to wear this to like an
upcoming carnival because might be next
year so these are actually the reason
why I went to the thrift store because
the shoe is going to be like like a
vintage inspired tomboy looks like with
Commerce and stuff you know the desk in
terms of had like tomboyish
but they're super cute cute cute like
the only thing that I mind can like
handle at this moment um but it's this
red white and black striped shirt and
it's the camera it's come freaking out
that it's okay and I got this for three
dollars super awesome and I love the
look of this
just like with some high-waisted jeans
so the next shirt is very similar to a
lots of different colors this is more of
a thicker striped shirt and it's more of
a like a see vibrant blue those material
of this is literally so thick like it's
a lot more high-quality than your
average like spin t-shirt um so a lot so
the last thing is the gem of this entire
trip and folks I've it so the pressure
to quickly tell you I was on Han I can't
talk I was on the hunt for mom jeans and
when everyone there there is such a
large selection for Jean um so this is
what they look like they are high
waisted mom jeans and they are vintage
one um and I just hold up the bottom
because I can go looks cuter that way
they have gigantic pockets in this on
Anand
which I love I love pockets I hate some
companies that make jeans and they hella
like their pockets and then they're fake
like like how am I supposed to where do
I put my home like she this is the
cutest thing ever so I went I took my
dad at digs and I was a dad you
recognizes brand-new jeans where is it
like most popular thing in the 90s so so
exciting like these are literally
vintage ones and these are the stone
wash ones as I go old travel the zipper
and they're so cute I love the tiger I
love that like look at the time and so I
love this was the cutest thing pair
distances um tucked in I wore it last
night and I was like internally crying
and screaming of joy because it was so
cute and I'm really excited that I kind
of is her mommy and ethically it so now
