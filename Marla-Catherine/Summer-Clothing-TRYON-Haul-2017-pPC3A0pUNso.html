channel so today is going to be a summer
haul because it feels like summer you
toss me my CDs weird like weather ways
they go get super cool to even snow but
it's no didn't last long anyway it was
like costume cold about super hot it is
so hot outside right now and so it feels
like summer so why not film at this
summer hall so most of the clothes are
for example but a few that are from the
fish stores that I found and so I just
wanna share them with you guys while you
guys are asking example is a legitimate
company and that I think they are
definitely my package is always come
whenever they say it has and I've only
had good experiences with them there are
a few items that sometimes don't show up
as they work pictured with all online
stores you're kind of risking got but
for the most part I would say is awful
is a pretty legitimate company and I
trust them and so I wouldn't recommend
ordering from them and that's my little
opinion and all links to these awful
clothes will be linked down below so
don't worry about that
totes dress anyway let's just get into
the features are good iconic I literally
you may or might not find them super
ugly or super funny or cute or whatever
I like them obviously about them you're
literally two dollars and they're those
like for real shirts or it has an actual
animal client that look real this is a
shark of debating on whether I should
get it or not and I end up getting it
because we're are the only two dollars
but I just we did so funny I did
actually really like sharks I like the
ocean I literally watched every single
shark or ocean documentary on Netflix
like name it and I've seen it so these
shirts I got another one just like it
accepts this one is a tiger I wear this
one today and I kept forgetting a few
looks but I just aren't making their
cell phone a love them it's just like a
tiger I just love them they're so like
they're a little bit oversized and
they're so comfy by the way I also got
those from the boy section of the fish
story so all I have a drifting video up
so just go watch that and I get to tell
you guys although all that good stuff
that's over I also got one more thing
since this dork that's it
they're inside out because everyone so
these are their mom jeans but they're
kind of different like they're
high-waist is I wish they wear but
they're still super cute the reason why
I love these so much is because of how
like soft they are so this is what they
look like just like on camera
these are Wrangler premium jeans and
Witter which is a super brand I love it
the little tag on the back and then also
they have a little like cross stitching
a new close-up of it you know but I just
thought that attitudes a look and if
they're super baggy but I really like
that mom jeans you know you know what to
expect so that was all I got from the
store because sometimes it's it admits
there sometimes you get a whole lot of
stuff sometimes you only get a few items
like that last trip for finally a few
items um so example I'm going to get
started that one this is the first shirt
I'm wearing right now
it's literally my favorite thing out of
all of them and it is like this
pea-green not P like PE a green this is
one of my favorite colors I like dark
greens I love all Tucker greens and it
has like a little embroidered plants on
the front it's so cute I just am
obsessed
I feel example has upgraded it their
quality in the clothing and they've made
it like the packaging my uniform and the
times are all uniform I was a little
nervous if this material cuts it's as a
t-shirt sometimes they make it like a
weird fabric but they still look an
apple t-shirt and so I love that and
it's like super soft
the next item for example I'm so excited
about because I we didn't know we was
going to say it right I didn't know
anyway normally I don't buy t-shirts
online because you don't know how
they're going to turn out but this fits
so well it is a super flowy totally
scream summer-like peasant blouse top
and it has embroidery on the top and on
the sleeves and it's kind of a peplum
kind of a bell sleeve all a good stuff
it is a very sheer but it's okay because
you can swear like a white camisole
underneath it and they'll be super cute
super adorable super trendy I just can't
thank you anyone I'm sorry you have some
ability I did excrete more so the next
thing is the bauble are these cool on
these jeans literally so I'm not like
this like super skinny or whatever I'm
like my average size but I got these in
a size medium and I wish I got them in a
size large just because I feel like they
are a little tight around my
hit but I they say in a leg I love the
length and I love the holes they're so
pretty they're just these light wash I
love the little wrist on the back part
of the ankles that I just thought about
absolute and they are super high quality
like they feel very nice so this next
product from example is this really cute
summer dress I am a little disappointed
because on the website oops decision
wind up you'll see all I'm not gonna
bother buttons buttoning disciplines you
guys are be seen little sick so on the
website it looks like a mini dress a few
inches off my knees it would not it's a
lot shorter but other than that like it
looks exactly like the pictures and I
really love the sleeves and it has like
the red and the darker blue stripes a
next dress I ordered it inside media and
I should have ordered it and it's nice
small but other than that it is so
pretty I love it it literally looks like
you just got it from Cancun like someone
who went on a cruise and brought you
back this shirt
so it's embroidered as you guys to tell
I've been obsessed with embroidery
lately and this leaves like keeper and
it's super long and super flowy and I
really love just the colors of this it's
just super like festive and I really
love it basic next one is a denim jacket
and I'm so excited that this fit just
right
I got it any size small but it's this
embroider that once again embroiders I
didn't drag it and it feels super like
it feel this good quality like it's not
going to fall apart and it has these
little flowers above the pockets and
then it has this embroidered like birds
with the little heart and flowers in the
back this next shirt is so me like it
just screams Marla I literally could not
I suppose it then cut at my side and I
was not sold out on his pizza and doing
Oberon because that's all I want
seriously like that is not too much at
or is it okay maybe it is it's just a
simple white t-shirt and it's just like
the same material as this ship that I'm
wearing you know it's a funny sure it's
one of those shirts you just buy it's
funny and they last
I oh I'm so glad to share with you guys
eyes if you know me I like vintage stuff
like I like more than relaxed vibe
thirsted so what I got a shirt this is
some Randy's it's black and then it has
white lettering and the only my only
complaint and it it was an example it's
me do as a pop pale I am I feel I
I wear black it makes me look like a
ghost but I'm willing to live with that
because I just honestly think this is
such a cute font and it shows they're
cute shirts okay if you're a little pill
you know so this is all for my summer
edition try on haul I could be guys
enjoyed it and you remember to it give
the video a thumbs up and I always like
this

hall and that's inch so thank you guys
