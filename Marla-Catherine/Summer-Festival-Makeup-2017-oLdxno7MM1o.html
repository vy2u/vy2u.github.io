is like eyeliner and makeup look good so
this video is in partnership with
Coastal Scents and it's featuring their
new revealed of matte palette which is
super pretty it has 20 eyeshadow colors
and it's 20 bucks so it's clearly like a
dollar an eyeshadow I'll have a link in
the downbar if you guys want to go in
purchase this item so I use this policy
would create this look it's more of a
it's a cut crease with yellow eyeliner
and super pretty and it's perfect for
like summer festivals or carnivals or if
you just realize me crazy
going over set me makeup so that's about
it so let's just get right on to it to
do so first off don't mind if I like
lift up my arms there's always I shall
squatted on it so all the products that
are we using today are very affordable
and it some of them are not in drugstore
but they're still like affordable so
let's just get started I'm so sorry what
the basic I'm going to be using a BB
cream and this is the L'Oreal Paris one
of my all-time favorite ones this is the
shade medium so I'm going in and making
like lines of where my wallet being
cream to go and then I'll start put it
on I'm going to go and rub it in with my
hands and then blend out with my Beauty
Blender you guys a lot of you guys are
freaking out we're like that's the shade
medium it's literally white so this type
of BB cream it changes color when you
blend it in when you blend it into your
skin it like oxidizes make sure your
hands are clean that way you're not
gross and then I just took me three
wandering and blending that so for the
most part this day and a part of this is
tutorials like every other video except
most of the products are portable
now that I have my base makeup blended
out my skin seems pretty good lately
like I feel like I don't really deep
concealer some not to be using any tear
as you can see Larry go use concealer so
this is where like vegetable makeup but
it's like still like not too I do want
to kind of switch it up and so they you
need to so a regular pink blush I'm
going to trying out this more autumn
it's called autumn glow and it's by self
here a cosmetics and this is like more
of an orangey tone which is perfect
because that I do and have some orange
tones so just we're gonna do for a
bigger mantras oh I don't think I tried
to sell before you get turns out like
one and I just you take a fluffy brush
and to put in their folder is nice like
glowing like an auto bailout and I'm
just kind of brushing that up into my
temples and to Sin City it's kind of
like a bronze color so it's your cheeks
so I just realized my fan was on and so
I'm sorry if it was super noisy or
annoying but I did snap turned off so
hopefully it didn't bother you but so
now for bronzer I am going to be using
via Pula one but you know what makes it
affordable this is a mini version and so
it's only 15 which is still pretty
expensive for a bronzer you know but I
just don't have a drugstore one right
now and so I'm just going to go with
this this is the first hoola bronzer I
ever bought and was the mini version and
I've had it since like the beginning of
last school year so it's been like a
long time in it and I'm just now honey
Pam so honestly like didn't even need to
buy the big one and I just gonna kind of
go in bronze in a little bit I just like
suck in my cheeks and glowy love and
that now I'm going to go in and fill in
my eyebrows my eyebrows are kind of
tinted right now it's starting to wear
off and I don't want them to be the
focus of the look so I'm going to be
just using that some essence make me
brow gel eye red gel mascara this is two
dollars so it doesn't get any more
affordable than that and this is like a
really really really good dupe for the
glove a boy bra so I would totally
recommend this they sell at Ulta I'm
just going to go ahead and kind of
intensify them a little bit more and
then you just groom them and then I'm
going to go do the other echo so now I
rose are done and I'm going to go in and
cert the eyes and so excited so in
today's video I am also partnering with
it um Coastal Scents and feature a nerdy
palette which is super kind of them to
send this to me and it's the revealed
matte palette I will enter it like a
swatch of all the colors they're all on
my own
they have it's a perfect palette if you
guys want something good and pretty good
quality for a really affordable price
it's 20 bucks I shadowed and they have
beautiful nude shades and some like for
reds and oranges and then a lot of
purple tones so you really do get a ton
of stuff and I'm going to be creating a
look with this today and I'm so excited
so I'm going to go in and start off with
this orange color and on
going to go and so we saw enough over my
eyelids like in the creek so how should
I go in and start off with like a base
color so maybe using this kind of like
yellow beautiful down in this corner
right here these I chose do not have
names so I'm sorry if it get confusing
on which I'm using but you can kind of
see so I go in and just custom fit in
all of my woods to kind of create a base
color because think about these
eyeshadows that they're very buildable
which is awesome because if you don't
want that much opacity then you can just
only throw in one cut if you want a
little more than can build it up and I'm
going to go in with this orange color
there's only like one orange color in
the palette that one right there I'm
going to go take all my brush and then
squeeze out in my creases and now I'm
going to take a fluffy collage well I'm
going to go in and take a fluffy brush
and just blend that all out and then I'm
going to go in and take a dislike brick
red sauce burgundy color and it's this
one right here and I'm going to go take
a little bit of that in intensify Makris
and it adds some depth and dimension so
I wanted to be really intense that way
when I cut the crease it looks because
it cut the cheese when I cut the crease
it like actually looks like there's a
difference and so I think it's pretty
intense right now so I'm going to go in
and just with the excess amount on the
other brush that I used I had the
Orangemen to go back in and sweep now
I'm going in with a flat brush I'm going
to go in and cut the crease so I'm going
to be using the NARS concealer but you
guys can totally use the Maybelline fit
me I'm so sorry I totally was big using
that right now but I don't own it and so
this is one one I have so right now I'm
going to go in on my weed leaf on my lid
and kind of find where like I want the
outline others consider to go and then I
go and I build it up with my brush and
start to cut it so you guys can kind of
see what I'm doing here you want to go
and find your crease and then it cut it
with your concealer so cutting it means
just like colliding it so my creatures
have been cut and they're not too
intense it's more like just like an
outline of the concealer but I'm not
going to go in with the Souper I think
it's like the brightest color in the
palette it's like almost like a white
it's basically white it would go in and
pack that onto the crease and this is
where the exciting stuff happens so I'm
going to using Nyx's mixes the NYX vivid
brights eyeliner and that this is in the
color yellow this is in vivid halo so
what you're going to do so first you
want to make like a line as if you're
making a wing and make sure you do it on
both eyes first that way they're equal
this is what it should look like but
you're going to go in and you're going
to create go and follow the like where
the creases been cut and go fall and
take eyeliner and cut draw a line
connecting this little wing you just
made and the connecting the tube please
don't judge me and don't at me I'm not
very good this but I was like going to
be my third time doing it so so now that
is the like look so far I like what they
go eyeliner I'm going to go I'll repeat
the same steps on the sign hope that
they turned out pretty similar so I not
did the eyeliner and it did try bad like
it turned out average but obviously
could've been like sharper and better
but it's so nerve-wracking to do it so
hope you guys understand but now I'm
going to go in and do some stuff on my
lash line like my bottom lash line lower
last night and I'm going to go in with
that same orange that we started out
with this one right here and then I'm
going to go smoke out out onto my one
lash line so now that that is one and
I'm going to go in and take it as black
of gel gel I'm going to take this block
I'm going to go in and take this a black
gel liner by colour-pop and this is a
pretty affordable one and it's my
favorite one I'm going to go in and just
put that on my upper lash line that way
it kind of thickens up the lash line
before it's gone mascara so now I'm
going to go in and curl my eyelashes
so for mascara maybe my all-time
favorite one be the atlast blast volume
waterproof mascara by covergirl Kineton
11 out of 10 would recommend and it's in
the shade web room and I'm going to do
my bottom lash line too so I think that
completes the eyes eye
they're like really cool they're like a
colorful I don't know why but they what
remind made like a comic like a like a
comic strip bureau so make sense and
it's very cool and festive and perfect
for just if you wanna be if you feel
like you know being crazy owns those
overnights really good for festival
makeup or going to the carnival ten on
ten and to fish it all off and we just
putting on some clear lip gloss and this
one's by Wet n Wild like literally like
a dollar fifty if you guys end up
recreating this look or if you're
creating a list using this College if
you GU guys can use the hashtag Coastal
Scents or hashtag or the old matte
palette and you guys all have a chance
to be featured on cultural senses social
pages and yeah this palette is really
good considering it's only 20 bucks and
I would highly recommend if you guys
like that matte warm tone with a mix of
like this purpley news anyway and if you
guys are create this let's make sure you
also techne and I'd like to see it it's
definitely different from my other ones
and and yeah this is pretty crazy
yellow eyeliner alright that's not it
I'll see you guys in my next video and
love you guys and fine
