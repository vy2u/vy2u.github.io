morning routine and this is me just
looking rough waking up you know summer
probably didn't wake up till around 2:30
and afternoon so the first thing I have
to do is brush my teeth because I don't
want to get orange teeth by the time I
get my braces off so that's a priority
and since it's summer and gotta get in
the summer vibes I just pump some jams
so if I start awkwardly do I start
awkward really awkward okay
I'm dancing very ugly basically so
ignore that and I like to just take my
hair out of whatever it was the night
before and put it up so we can just
start to like wash my face that way gets
off all the crusties and gross stuff
so after that I like to go and apply a
face mask because face masks are awesome
especially during the summer because
skin is in and these are my absolute
favorite ones from Knotts they basically
just have a bunch of different ones like
brightening your skin soothing your skin
making you hopefully anti-aging all that
good stuff they're also from Korea and
so don't eat freak out it's not sketchy
at all it's just super cool because
Korea I feel like is always ahead of the
skin game so right now I'm sitting on
the deep water wrapping mask and this
one is to refresh and moisturize your
skin which is what I need right now I
should have been so dry lately which is
not like because normally my schedule a
coily so it looks like this when you
unfold it kind of looks like a mask you
wear in Halloween Oh two to four it was
listed I was like why I'm going to face
my skis did you do my skin because
there's another layer of plastic and I
had on the plastic side clearly mom
you're raising me wrong or something to
loosen up our news oh there you go there
you go now it's picking my skin my skin
feels so that so after I'm done
pampering myself my skin all that good
stuff I normally like to go and eat some
breakfast so summer I always make
smoothies it's just my tradition
whatever so I didn't have any orange
juice or replace it some with some
pineapple juice some coconut milk some
amigos and strawberries some stevia and
some honey and then I just put that all
into a magic bullet and blend it up
together
this literally tasted so good I was kind
of waiting it when I was baking this but
it literally probably it tastes like
Jamba Juice like I did not know the
difference
so just blend that up and then since
it's summer and the weather is always
good I like to go outside and just drink
it and I know I'm sitting alone I'm such
a loser I'm so sorry but the view was so
pretty I'm just I love you Tom mountains
are so pretty this challenge I'm not so
after I eat breakfast I like to go and
work out if it's one of those days and
I'm in the mood and so normally I just
count the trampoline as my workout after
that I'll get ready if I'm going out
what's the time I just don't even wear
makeup during the summer but if I do so
if I do wear if I am going out I will
apply a little bit of makeup like
tomorrow it's a desk you spray mascara
eyebrow albin and sealer and we're good
to go
hi ladies and then I dance to some more
awkward music okay
after that I if I am going out which I
never do I will probably not do my hair
but for this video I was forced to do
this so I like to curl my hair because
it's just that summer beachy wait like
summer beachy waves I have a video on
this you guys don't watch it you don't
have to you just a suggestion and then I
put it up into that half up to keep my
bangs on her face because it's humid and
I don't want to get all sweaty and gross
watching okay hey I'm selling my own
youtube videos so I normally just stay
in the pajamas shot top that are
sleeping in because I normally sleep in
good like do these t-shirts and then I'm
just gnawing on some shorts because it's
kind of hot outside so these are just
like you actually need used to be jeans
and I'm not a lot of wear those short
short ones because I'm a Mormon
so my pairs and half of I'm not very
good at following these things I'm sorry
to do stance have a side gap there you
go this is leg up and then probably you
can throw on some Jesus sandals my hose
and a half's up and it's curled I was
literally almost no makeup on and that's
it normally my summer retain
yes I will be searched on Johansson
