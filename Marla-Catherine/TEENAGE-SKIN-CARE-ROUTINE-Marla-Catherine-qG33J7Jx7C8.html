don't look like my 8 like honestly what
am I supposed to do give me a solution
so yes I'm a teenager in 13 my name is
Marlo subscribe if you have it you'll
you'll enjoy hey guys what's up it's
Marla and welcome back to my channel we
have a another video and it is going to
be a teenage skincare routine and a lot
of cars that dude I literally use every
day like an auntie day so to start off
my whenever I am undoing the day like
just taking out me or whatever I have to
use coconut oils so coconut oil is super
awesome and this is just a big bottle
from a Costco and it's actually really
cheap if you think about it because if
you Gigi know why she like 12 bucks per
pack this is like low books and this
last you an entire year coconut oil is
super awesome freaking up waterproof
makeup mascara it like makes it just off
like butter but it comes off real good
and now that I added have that like
massaged into my face and all the makeup
is like now not removed yet but like all
about my Johnson's a baby head-to-toe
wash and just walk off the coconut oil
and this is really good for just keeping
your based moisturizer it's gentle on
the skin and a lot I actually got a lot
of questions on why I use this and not
ready there are free swatch and it's
because I mean it's variable to uses on
baby the preacher to your face and also
I know a lot of people are worried about
letting day wash the face was like a
face wash that it hurts our eyes but
this is a no tears so yeah this is even
hurt when it gets in your eyes so
business day eyes like a clay mask and
it's super awesome and I use this into
my overnight acne routine hey it's my
all-time favorite one it doesn't make
your skin red for like 10 minutes after
this I ripped out all the dirty stuff
like it is good and we've had this like
a year and barely even use like an eight
with itself the best part about this if
you get a huge container for five
dollars let's just have a women of
appreciation so if I don't do a face
mask I like to exfoliate and my favor
exfoliator
it's poppy and pop coffee and see orange
and natural by scrub this is the best
smelling thing ever I'm not allowed to
drink coffee but doesn't mean I love the
smell of it
so this Mel's awesome it is really so
good at just taking out all the dead
skin and making you feel like you're a
snake but you peel off all your desk in
your good so I do not do a napkin that I
thought it is that's a little too much
on skin by either Julie one of the two
now if I do not wish right I'm gonna
spray so though I are super weird right
there so I couldn't really film but it
took we bought selfies actually I did I
can't take a selfie for terrorist wifey
okay so this then then if I don't want
to request this if I don't my started
with my face moisturizer then I'm going
to be spraying myself like spraying my
face with it rosanell hydrating
tournament and there's the Mario Badescu
which is like seven bucks was just
awesome it's probably going to be the
next one I buy but this one is also
really good too it's the coffee and how
it grows and aloe hydrating tourists and
literally the ingredients are just like
rosewater grapefruit waters like a load
