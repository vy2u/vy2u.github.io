and for this to it and for this week
back to this episode marley happened so
it's gonna be a collective back to
school hall and 3/16 to a 1700 e towards
370 sounds so weird
so we're 2017 so i'm gonna only have one
pair of shoes to show you guys cuz i'm
pretty stocked up on shoes right now so
i get more if you guys watched my
whistle back-to-school outfits alfred
ideas you guys would have sewn these but
if you didn't let me catch you up but
what's going on so these are from drops
and oh my gosh they're so cute and the
best part is i only got these for 15
bucks going on with Aeropostale this is
a very lightweight sweatshirt that I got
for 12 bucks from Aeropostale and I
think having a lightweight sweater is a
must-have because like there's those
days when you're just randomly chilly
but you don't want to get on like a huge
winter coat and it is a very pretty open
your own color which will match a ton of
things and they just have their logo in
the corner next up from Aeropostale is
the this shirt that you saw in my a lot
of these things will be seen from my
previous video which was a
back-to-school lookbook this is just a
crop top but it's like oh I like to call
them like lock tops because they're long
the crop tops
and next up from Aeropostale is the the
jeans that I got in there the dark wash
and they have just a few ribs and I've
been obsessed with them there's a
straight leg and normally I got the
skinny but hurt leg I just feeling it I
have these t-shirt and it was a really
good deal it was by one t-shirt for full
price which they're like normally 20
bucks but then you get two for free this
one is just an army green and I just
love the yellow I love the co and
mustard and it's in the lettering and
then this one the same exact style t
except this one is I love this color
it's the mustard yellow and then it has
their logo in the just white lettering
so then it last but not least from
Aeropostale is these jean leggings and
they're just called the jeggings and
it's in the lightest wash they have and
I've been wanting it for like these
forever in they're on sale for 20 bucks
and so back-to-school shopping
yay so this is from route 21 I went
there and route 21 I don't truck there
often but today he went there and this
is like a speckled white shirt is kind
of like marbling any I love the fit I
tried it on and I was just like oh my
gosh I love the fit of this and then I
got this bodycon dress from her 21 and
it was only three bucks like honestly
and that's all I got from route 21 now
now from forever 21
um I surprisingly didn't get too much
there because I love that I love that
store but at some times I don't love it
but it doesn't love me but so I went
there and I was looking at their graphic
tees I saw this one I just thought it
was so like funny for some reason that I
got it
eight bucks and it has sushi on it I
don't even like sushi but just I'm so
funny
Khushi sushi then from forever 21 I got
this what color is this I'm just gonna
call it burnt sienna I got this burnt
sienna jacket from forever 21 and last
year I got one those kind of similar
style to it
so here's and then last but not least
from from the F 21 is this peplum very
pretty peplum in this rose color I've
been obsessed with the rose and mustard
color and from I went to cotton on for
the first time ever and I found some
pretty good deals there and these are
pants and they this little size a little
big for me but it gives it like that
boyfriend effect look and I just thought
it was so you guys saw these in my
lookbook and it has just the lettering
on the sides and I love the wash I love
the ends and how they're kind of like
war and last but not least from cotton
is these jeans and I love you so much
they're very skinny they're very tight
but that's what apparently and on the on
the jeans it's different washes and
there's patchwork and if on the back
also like that's a pocket but that's
just like a stain of a pocket a little
weird but I love it um but then I went
to Asian Evan got this black and white
striped and I it's just the classic
black and white stripe I don't even know
if the cameras picking it up but I
didn't have one and I kind of need one I
love them so that's a rack for the
clothes and I just interested thank you
