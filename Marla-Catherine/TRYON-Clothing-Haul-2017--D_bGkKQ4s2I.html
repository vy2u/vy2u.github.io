gonna get roasted in section hey guys it
is Mara and today we're going to be
doing a California Hall
I think that's what I meant I like
because I purchased most of these items
in California so I'm just gonna call it
California Hall so let's get right on
into it okay I'm gonna start off with
forever 21 so the first item of this is
this jean jacket I'm wearing right here
I got it from forever 21 and I think it
was about
2995 so it's like 30 bucks which I do
not think that it's about price after
all for a jean jacket and this one it
feels it very high quality and I love
the ribs and it's kind of that oversized
look and this will be a perfect layering
a sensual for fall especially that it's
like 30 degrees here you thought it's so
cold
every time I gotta from Tron I always
get a pair of these because they're only
like 99 cents no I like these are 390
these are for know they're like
literally four dollars and I always wear
it black leggings they're always a must
for me and so I just picked up a pair of
those too
I've and I got this I'm really excited
about this because I've been wanting a
beret and I went to Urban Outfitters and
I saw their berets there and they had
like a cute color selection but there
were $30 for one beret and I just think
that that's kind of ridiculous and it's
not that it's ridiculous it's just I
wanted to see if I could find a cheaper
dupe somewhere else and I really like it
I think it's very festive I am still
trying to figure out how to style okay
I'm still trying to figure out how to
style it so don't make fun of me but
when I do figure it out I think it'll be
super cute and I really love this color
and tops to forever21 for having
literally the exact same thing as Urban
Outfitters for a whole lot cheaper and I
think this was like $13 so the last
thing I got from forever 21 was this I
think this is like a dark blush but it's
a bodysuit and I think this was I wore
it too in my Meetup and I always tuck in
my shirt into my overalls and so this
was super nice to just have it was
literally five dollars and it was in the
sell section my sister actually found
this and I really liked it so I
purchased it it's obviously not the
highest quality but you don't really
need to have like you know
your t-shirt so the next items were from
the first door and I went 13 inside of
California I'm kind of mad at myself now
looking back on it but we were also kind
of rushed in the situation but I did not
film a 13 video there we went to the
goodwill in California and their
goodwill was so good maybe they're just
something like a really good day or I
don't know but we went there and I found
more items which I feel like is a lot
for its thrift store cuz normally don't
even find any stuff so this first item
is I was kind of on the fence my side
and then I tried it on and I thought you
know I was like this could be cute so I
purchased it so this is a gigantic like
when I say gigantic this is a I don't
know it's like this is this is huge and
it's a big green sweater and it's super
flowy and I think it'll be really pretty
with a pair of leggings especially
during the fall or winter when it's
super cold it and for Thanksgiving
especially when you have a food baby you
want to hide it this is the sweater when
are we going to my mom picked this up
for me and I end up actually liking it
so I purchased it it was $5.99 and it is
this shimmery gold shirt and it's like a
subtle shimmer like it's not very
intense which I like and this was super
pretty and I think this is also just
another festive fall thing I like
purchased so many fall items even though
it was like really hot in California but
since I live in Utah it's cold so it's
fine
the next item I'm super excited about
this is like when I picked it up I
almost picked it up as a joke and then I
look at this notes like wait I kind of
like that so I went and tried it on and
I loved it so much the more when I tried
it on it made me think of like clueless
kind of that preppy schoolgirl look and
I think that is so cute I love it the
more I looked at this I realized this is
like what camp war and the Napoleon
Dynamite movie when he started like
turned a gangster you know like when
he's dating laFonda
this is like the shirt he wore if I got
a gold eagle necklace like I would be
him probably the last item I'm so stoked
about because I like to be modest and
normally overall shorts they're shorter
so like they're like but shorts and I
just not about that and so when I found
these are so excited because they are
overall Schwartz but they're like
mid-thigh I wore these to a meet-up and
they were so comfortable they were super
cute and I got lots of compliments on
them and they're from Old Navy and I got
these for $9.99 so this next item is
from a brand email hold up this next
item is I purchased it inside of PacSun
but it's brandy melville it's this I
wore this to California guys saw this in
an instant post if you follow me there
at Monica's room and it says natives of
the golden coast and I just really like
it it has palm trees in an ocean and I
thought it was perfect for California
it's always cold here in Utah during the
winter and this will be super nice to
just throw on especially during school
and I'm really excited about this the
next two items I'm very I can't take
said anyway I'm very happy that I
purchased we went to a brandy melville
like an actual brandy melville store and
I they don't have one of those in Utah
and we were in it
I literally land five minutes to shop in
there so I just grabbed what I thought
was cute I tried it on super quick and
then I ended up purchasing these two
items
so they're both pants and I've been
wanting these for so long but they're
the brand-new Melville like denim white
striped pants and I think these are so
comfortable and they're so pretty they
just look like a class a like a classy I
don't know how to explain it but I
really love the look of them and you
know just the brandy melville ask look
and that I got another pair of the same
style pants but these are black and grey
striped and these will be so nice to
just wear when I'm sick of them and I
just want to wear something comfortable
but I don't wanna wear leggings these
are gonna be what I go to and I really
really like these and at the last but
certainly not the least item is this
lifeguard jacket and a lot of you guys
are asking what this was from it and
it's just shops that are like the
outdoor strip malls so I went into one
of those souvenir shops and I found this
jacket it was half off the entire store
was half off so this jacket is normally
40 bucks but I got 420 which i think is
a super good price for a sweatshirt I
really love it I am it's just a bright
red lifeguard Huntington Beach
sweatshirt and I push it in picture of
me wearing this on Instagram and you
guys are freaking out about it because
you
love the sweatshirt so yeah I got this
for 20 bucks at one of those huh need to
be souvenir shops so if you guys are
interested in purchasing in one of these
then just go check out so when you're
shopping you could probably find one
just like it
make sure you guys give this video a
thumbs up you can subscribe thank the to
do is super boring but you guys were
requesting it and so I wanted to show
you guys what I got in California I hope
you enjoyed it if you did give it thumbs
up I'll see you guys in my next video
bye I get my braces off in one week
pretend you're like going to see like
auditioning for the bye fine and they're
