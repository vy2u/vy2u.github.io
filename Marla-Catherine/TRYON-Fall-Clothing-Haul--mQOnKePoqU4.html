it is Marla and today we're gonna be
doing a fall haul I really love hauls
and it always means more clothes and I
love more clothes and I'm so excited
about this I'm collaborating with via
who to bring you guys this video I'm so
excited about it because if you watched
any of my other holds up collaborated
with them a few times and I absolutely
love them I think their clothes are so
cute and the pretty good quality and
they're pretty cheap and so if you guys
like any of these clothes or you just
want to check out the website I have a
50% off a discount code and I'll have
that in the description box which makes
a huge difference that is half off so
definitely go take advantage of that all
the links to all the items that I show
in this video will be in the description
box so if you guys wanna go check any of
those out if you guys want to win a baby
wardrobe that is worth the $500 just go
check out the information in the
description box below and I mean why not
enter that's $500 with the clothes and
that is a lot of clothes now that this
intro is going on for a while I'm gonna
now get into the veil so first things
first is a sweater because fall sweater
weather
so this first winner is this really
pretty lavender but it's a more of a
purple toned and that this is I think my
first item that I've owned that is
purple it's like a half turtleneck so
it's kind of more like a mock neck so
this sweater if it's super well it
reminds me of a brandy melville quality
so just to give you guys an idea so the
next item is what if I up favorites from
the entire haul and I didn't know if
this was gonna fit me well cuz normally
jean jackets don't this fit really well
and I'm so excited about that what makes
it really Hugh's first off it's the
color pink but also it has this
removable which is super nice but it's a
removable like first strip and it has
that really cool like it's not the most
high-quality denim but I'm almost I like
that because then it's more like jacket
feelings that make sense so doesn't feel
like it sticks like it just feels like a
nice wearable and movable jacket so this
next item I'm kind of sad because II
didn't fit very well but if it did fit
well like if it did fit me then it
probably would be one of my favorites
but it's another pink item so
but okay and it's just a nice i feel
like during the fall i do like to wear
fall colors but i also like to spice it
up with like regular colors because just
shout a little bit more brightness into
your life because sometimes fall can get
a little like like yeah a little gloomy
so I didn't pops of colors like pink is
always nice so this next item is these
the next item is these are these the
next item are these jeans and I really
like these I really think these jeans
are very subtly eye catching so that
make sense
they look like we're either jeans at
first glance but when you look on the
leg there is a like seam running through
the middle and I think that is like
unique but it's not too unique where you
feel like you're out of your comfort
zone if you guys are experimenting with
your fashion styles that you want to try
out some of like these type of clothing
styles this is definitely a good thing
to purchase because it's not too crazy
but it's still kind of like it's a baby
step out of your comfort zone I'm so
good that I got a home run and PE when
you see me in the Olympics just be like
that's my so this next pair of jeans are
these super bedazzled ones and bedazzled
gotta own it so these jeans are very
cool and right I country they have these
slight iridescent through these
iridescent flower shaped gems and if
they're very pretty and they're also at
the leg
I wish there it was a little bit tighter
and round of my hips but like my waist
but other than that these are pretty
cute and I also like the end of the
jeans they're like a rock em and it
looks like someone just cut them and I
think that's very pretty and just a nice
touch and I bet these would be so easy
to DIY at least like this part so this
next item is a pair of overalls
so insert and scrimping here yeah you
guys seem to really love these and I
love them too so I'm excited about that
but these are really pretty overalls and
I'm
so I'm wearing it overalls right now so
if you guys could not tell I do like
overalls and I really like these these
are a new favorite but they have really
pretty patches and I think they're super
adorable and they have and there's one
on the front pocket too like right there
and I just think it's a nice touch and
overall they're so comfortable and
they're so easy like I feel like it you
can't go wrong with overalls you just
can now I know that this and this is not
lined up but we're in the middle of
fixing that so don't need to comment
about it I know that the wallpapers not
lined up anyway
this is a jumpsuit it's just really
pretty not I wouldn't necessarily call
it retro but it's this like striped
different colored more neutral more
neutral colored stripes but I just think
this is perfect for a fall and it's very
nice and classy and I think this would
be really pretty to wear to like a
school event that you don't want to wear
a dress to but one be more dressed up
for or anything which you're too bad
really just like a lot of things now the
last three items of this hall are going
to be shoes and I like shoes so this
next pair of shoes are these they're
called woven ballet slippers these are
really pretty and they seem pretty
high-quality and it's just this nice
woven shoe that I could really like
throw on with almost anything
then at these next fresh shoes whatever
sandals is there they could be coming
fall but for church it will be nice
anyway there are these sandals and they
strap around your ankles so this next
red shoes are another pair of like strap
around your ankles and they're white
have a woven chip and have some studs so
this will be super nice and since
they're white and a neutral like tan
these will literally notch anything
these last shoes and last items of
internal all are my new favorite I do
about these like I don't know I just
there's something about these may not be
they are these really once again they're
pink
they're these pink loafers Muellers I
don't know the exact style which I'm
kind of bummed about because it plus
should know it cuz they're so cute but
they're these slip-on shoes that have a
really pretty pink velvet texture I'm
gonna call it a crane I
to crane but it's like this white crane
with some flowers and these people in
its firm really love these two and I
love them too and I just think they're a
nice thing to add to your collection of
shoes and they will match they feel like
dick since they're like not too crazy
they'll still match a few items and then
that last but not least I kind of lied
because that's not the last item this is
last time these overalls I'm currently
wearing right now are from boohoo - and
these are also not paper I ordered I did
order to piece of overalls which I am
obsessed and these were the other
parents the black ones and I wore these
today at school I got so many
compliments on them and I really love
easier so comfortable that wraps up this
