a summer edition try on haul and I know
you guys might notice that my hair is
back to blonde and it's because the pink
washed out already that's really lame
but we're not kind of thinking of doing
a different colors so stay tuned for
that but let's just get right on into
the video so to start off we're gonna do
shoes and these are the same set pair is
ones I think I already showed you guys
but these are the gold this is the gold
pair of the same shoes I showed in the
last haul I think and it's just I love
them so much they're from go Jane
they're like these sandals but I have
this exact and they're jelly and they're
so comfortable I love them links to
these products will be down in the
downbar if you want to go check them out
or similar items because I don't know if
they're all gonna be in stock or
whatever you know these shoes were given
to me by Katy I just like to say thank
you t if you are watching this but
they're too crazy commerce this is the
first pair these are they first prayer
they're like a peachy wine floral and
they're just the converse brand they're
just white and then they have like a bit
the floral Plus pineapple please decide
to join mine all today and I don't okay
so all this makeup I absolutely love and
I used everyday they're just so good but
this is the Urban Decay all nighter
makeup setting spray and the reason why
I know this especially for summer is
because it makes you so your face
doesn't feel it's feel like it's dry or
it's a kicked up and this kind gives you
that dewy look and it literally keeps it
on all day it's great especially for
that summer activities and just summer
days this is my next makeup product that
I want to share with you guys and it is
the benefit hydrating could tinted lip
balm there like about that size this is
the benebalm especially with having
braces it makes my teeth look so yellow
and my teeth are just yellow and so
whenever I can't really wear lip colors
but with tinted it makes it look like
your lips are naturally that color and
so I love that they're moisturizing and
for my next and final makeup product
this is the Becca highlighter in the
cut in the color champagne pop and this
is so pretty
Jacqueline Hale on YouTube created this
product it is a very pretty highlighter
and it gives you that nice summery glow
for the summer and for all year round
and it is just like you turn your head
you have a nice pop of shimmer and it is
so pretty but for the clothing items
there's not too many but the I just want
to share them for you guys that I'm
lying this one right now it is a t-shirt
dress from Aeropostale and it's just
that a gray knit and it's very flowy
it's not tight and it it's just very
comfortable especially for the summer
when today I didn't feel like wearing
pants or I'm sure it's so wearing a
dress is also it's just like it feels so
good for my next item of clothing this
is another dress and this is from
Charlotte Russe and it is a peachy pink
color which is perfect for the summer
like that pretty color and it has that
like that form-fitting kind of type and
then it's almost like a skinnier dress
and it is so pretty it's yet again just
that breezy nice like especially when
you don't want to have to wear actual
clothes for my next item of clothing
this is a dress from forever 21 and it
is very flowy I love the print and this
color is kind of what sold me it will to
other two reasons to why it sold me
first off the color do you see this it's
like a jade green and that's not that
common
like there's mint green and then there's
Justin green and this is like that
perfect combo and then it has these
gorgeous like grounds grandma floral if
that makes any sense but I love that and
also the other reason that sold me was
this is a maxi dress and a very flowy
maxi dress with no slits I feel like
when you go anywhere nowadays you try to
find a dress or any skirt that's like
maxi style there's a slit up to your
belly button um sister is like a
bandanna print and I think that is so
pretty and festive for the summer
especially around fourth of July this
will be so cute and just year round it's
a maxi skirt
it's from Charlotte Russe and it's just
it's very stretchy and
I don't like to be in tight these
especially during the summer when it
gets all hot and stuffy the next item of
clothing is a shirt from Aeropostale and
it is Republic of California and it's
just a gray t-shirt and it has the
California Bear except the California
bear is like in that American flag print
except then again these this is not
stars it's like Cabana of leaves banana
League the last but certainly not the
least I am clothing is these jeans from
Aeropostale and they are this army green
print and I got these a little bit while
back but I never showed them in my last
fall and they are just that olive green
color and they're the jeggings in so
they're very stretchy and movable and so
forth during summer if it's a little bit
cooler but I'm active then this will be
easy to plan and I would like to say
