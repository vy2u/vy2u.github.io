back to our Katherine
today's video is going to be a haul
because I got some stuff that I want to
share and brag about that seemed really
rude that is not what I actually like in
real life emanated yeah
what a baby I cannot handle one main
theme is like an IDs
I can handle spicy first up from forever
21 PS this is gonna be a charm haul
first up is let's dress it like it's a
grandma floral print but it's not it's
like on fleek and it's the query like
sleeve it's super super super super
stretchy picked up from forever 21 is
these Caviar's they're so cute like we
got them mainly for photos but what's
lame is forever21 only shows their
headbands online and so I also got this
other headband and you guys already saw
this and some Instagram photos but it's
the heartbreaker one it's so cute
I've never had been in a relationship so
you can not really say that I'm a
heartbreaker but if I was I'd be
breaking all the boy's heart
hey singing rebel so next up from
forever 21 is this mint jacket it's like
a tiffany blue it's like a cross between
mint and tiffany blue what's his amazing
I love it guys get this it's normally
like 40 bucks an hour four five five
let's just take a moment of appreciation
is that it for over 21 that is it from
forever 21 next up is from H&amp;amp;M from hm I
am wearing this sweater already so you
don't have to say that but it's this
cactus sweater and I'm going to be
wearing it and it's during photoshoot so
go check that out and it's super cute
it's a long sleeve and we're so I live
in Utah if you didn't know don't stop me
and find out where I look that'd be
super creepy but either the Utah and the
weather is so unpredictable that you
never know and it mixed up from this is
actually from JC Penney's and it's
mainly for photoshoots cuz I probably
would not wear this in public but it is
this white fur vest the back is a little
ugly it reminds me of my grandma's knit
sweaters which is not okay moving on
with this haul um it's the shirt from
H&amp;amp;M again I got it for like six bucks
and me and my sister actually 20 and
it's so cute it's long and it covers my
booty big fat butt wiggle wiggle last
but not least is a swimsuit from watt
Webb from rad swim it is so cute and I
got it sent to me for Instagram and I
love as much as some gold sequins in
this area and it's this again once again
this Tiffany sasha mint blue color and i
think that was it from hmm
yes that was it o-o out to show your ID
sony's they're so cute Oh feel like Teen
Vogue material when I wear these so next
up is makeup so I posted a easily on one
hand is not mine
I posted an Instagram photo and use the
hashtag unicorn eyes and my eyelashes
were pink and blue and y'all were like
where to master oh I got my mascara from
Ulta the mother of all beauty stores
it's the NYX brand and I got pink and
blue I also put on my snapchat story at
Merlyn Kathryn and I only showed you
guys the blue but I first went sister to
go back and get the pink because I just
thought they were too cute and they're
super all Pig and I love that next up
for mukil the hoola bronzer on let's
just take a moment of a bridge agent so
the full size of this is $30 and I got
this for 15 we got this from Sephora but
it's made if I benefit this is kind
underneath the makeup category but it's
the Misti your perfume perfume performs
well because my next Instagram post it
smells so good if I could show you if I
could transfer the Sun to you you
probably would fade
