I'm filming a YouTube video stay still
it is currently like six o'clock and
it's really dark outside so I'm doing
box lights today hey guys is Marla and
today we're gonna be filming a thirst
short-haul I'm so glad to be filming
this because I haven't thrifted in quite
a while I feel like it's minimum once -
once I think yeah so I went through
shopping today
it was super successful and oh I'm so
excited so let's just get right on into
this by the way and very aware that this
says absque right I don't know where the
S went I think it fell off or my brother
stole it you can do that too you can
obscure if you are watching this you've
probably already seen my thirst with me
video where I got all these closes so if
you have not seen that video then links
down below so first off I have this peak
champion pullover hoodie well over
sweatshirt this is so soft like I can't
even explain to you guys how soft this
is on the inside but I got this for like
20 bucks and I think that is a steal
because these are normally like 40 or 50
and its a bright bubblegum pink which i
think is super cute and it's cheery
because during January gets a little
dull and so try to spice things up with
it okay
the next item I got was this this kind
of looks like a Where's Waldo t-shirt
but I'm diggin it like I kind of like it
it feels not thick but very high quality
I also like how the collar is thicker
striped red you know just wool emphasis
on that by the way almost everything is
haul is like red toned or red or pink or
something like that I did not plan that
it just it just happened okay so I have
a friend named Amy and Amy and I were at
a basketball game and this kid was
wearing a I said Patagonia and I thought
it was like a cool t-shirt and then my
friend Amy was like oh I love that shirt
I love Patagonia and I was like what's a
Patagonia found out what Patagonia was
that I kind of became obsessed with that
brand so I've been trying to thrift some
Patagonia stuff and today is the day let
me make this look more presentable my
entire family went through shopping with
me today and so you know family had
Thursday their sticks together it's just
like a fuchsia dark almost burgundy I
don't know it's kind of an interesting
like plum color yeah it just has a
little pucker right there nice and neat
so this next item is
breakers I was actually snapchatting
Hana
melosh if you guys know who she is she's
a really cute YouTube channel and she
was like what are you doing today and I
was like oh I'm going thrifting and then
and then she was like oh yeah that's
super cool I went fifteen the other day
too and I found this red windbreaker or
a red jacket and I was like well that's
so cute and then I went 13 and I found
this it's this Nike red very high
quality my breaker and I love the way
that this fits it just looks very I'm at
a football game it's cold and I'm
wearing a windbreaker that didn't go as
planned by the way I look like this
because it's the end of the day on
tumblr I found this photo of a it's a
girl and she's like going like let me
try to get this pose right she was like
going like this yeah just imagine that
and it was like super bright and she's
wearing this really cute pink
windbreaker and I just thought that I've
always thought that photo it was so cute
I've never been able to find something
that looks like really similar to that
if you if that makes sense
and today I found something that
honestly looks like a replica and I'm
super excited about that but it's this
very lightweight pink windbreaker and
it's a baby pink it's kind of sheer it
legit looks like the exact same as the
one in the photo and so I am very
excited about this the one thing I
really like about this so the Nike one
that I just picked up is a little bit
more heavy-duty but this is super
lightweight this will be nice like
during the spring or summer when I just
want a cute Jackie to put on I just
really like this color it's super pretty
I'm a fake fan I've never been to Hawaii
I really want to go to Hawaii I have a
friend that lives in Hawaii Ava if
you're watching this that friend is you
and I'm a little jelly because literally
I think when I go to Hawaii so bad I
found this t-shirt and it was in the $5
bin and I was like it's $5 I was so
close to buying this Price is Right
t-shirt so I really loved that TV show
but I end up not getting it but I got
this and it was five bucks I really just
like the color it's now I has a picture
of like some palm trees it's just Aloha
State but one day I will go to Hawaii
maybe this next item I was super excited
to find on the hanger and then I was
like it's probably not gonna fit but I
still picked it up and I tried it on and
they fit and I really like the way that
they fit almost like a khaki I don't or
quad Roy all these different types of
leg materials I don't know how to
describe the material or the texture of
these pants but let me tell you they're
nice I really like them and
they have honestly these are my all-time
favorite type of pants are the ones that
scrunch at the waist and that's why I
own so many brandy melville pants is
because I like the way that they like
scrunch at the waist they're a little
bit wider pant leg and I like that
because then and I like tapers off at
the waist and they're high-waisted this
color is very pretty and I'm just super
excited wear these and the last but most
certainly not the least item is this
this is what they look like they're a
light wash and if they're a little bit
worn and they have a Calvin Klein I
think to be completely honest like I
don't care what the brand is as long as
I like the way it fits top of the items
I found were actually like really nice
named Browns and the other half we're
just like unknown brands but I really
like that item so but these happen to be
common Klein which is a bonus I love the
way that these fit these are also not
zipper they're button which i think is
super nice because I know that it won't
bust the zipper because zippers are just
not my friend that wraps up today's at
their shawl I literally like woah anyway
