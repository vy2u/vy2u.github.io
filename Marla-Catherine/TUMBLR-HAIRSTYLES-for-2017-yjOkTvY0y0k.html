work backward I have their video sorry
just a little hand myself anyway today's
video is going to be here I defeated for
I don't know dude it thought it's going
to be tumblr hairstyles or short to
medium length hair and I'm so excited
for this video because I think you'll be
really good at like you anyway I love
you guys and let's get into the video
that's going into the video the first
hairstyle is at space funds and these
are my personal favorite hairstyle of
all time so the first thing you want to
do is brush out your hair because it's a
lot easier to deal with and after you're
not you're going to want to be sure her
is coordinated down the middle so the
next step after parting your hair is to
put both of the sections of hair into
two high ponytails once that is done
you're going to make sure your ponytails
are like in the same position that way
they are even so after doing that you're
going to want to take your brush and
ride your point hello to your desired or
body know now that you was like Harley
Quinn you want to go and you want to go
you're going to take your one of your
ponytails and start to twist them put
that into a bun formation you know after
that take your elastic I'm using clear
ones that way they don't show up and if
you like the way it looks but you can
just keep it like that but I'm going to
kind of change it and let me catch the
way look by using bobby pins you can go
like coal part your bun to make it
bigger now that that butt is done I'm
gonna go and do the other side
okay so now my buns are all done I can
feel a silver cute silver and next
hairstyle next art style is a super-cute
half hub but there's a little twist on
it so let's just sit into the video what
we're already in the wheel I'm going to
go straight on the top of my eyebrow and
then - I'll keep on going and section it
and then take a little rubber band so
now that you have a rubber band you're
going to kind of move it up like tighten
it and then repeat the same thing on the
other side so once you have your
ponytails you're going to go in and wrap
them just a little and that's it so this
one's a little bit more like playful and
finish if that makes sense but I still
think it's super cute and it especially
if you guys like to scrunchies instead
of like clear elastics that would be so
cute now the next hairstyle is a
different version of this one take your
ponytail and it start to turn it and
then it put it into a space fund and
that that's it for this year style it's
super cool and it's another version of
the space funds except for this is for
especially shorter hair because you can
still do this with really shorter and I
think this one is especially cute and
super tumblr okay for the next hairstyle
we're going to show you how to do braid
braid the next hairstyle is for all you
guys that love to braid just like me but
I can't really do that many breaks my
card is kind of a lot that belong
anymore
so how bright you're going to grab a
small section or a medium sized section
and then it divide that into three
sections then here to take it the middle
section of the braid and cross it over
the left that furthest section go watch
another video
okay anyway so you're just gonna make a
braid I'm gonna make my Dutch and
Duchess when you cross over instead of
under that's all it is okay so now you
have a brain you're gonna rubberband
cannae progressively throughout the
video I get more and more excited I
start off like hey guys like so on fake
now we read this great food on the other
side
okay so now that you have your two
braids this is where the magic happens
so you're gonna go in and start a bottom
or the top I prefer the pot up out now
you're going to go and pancake each an
individual like strand you know so
that's just where you basically pull it
outwards and I'm going to do mine a heck
a lot because I like the way it was okay
so now you can leave them down like this
if you guys like that but I am going to
make it a half up so you just go and you
connect them in the back and then bring
my face it may take up some baby hairs
and that's all for this hairstyle it is
still is so okay honestly these are all
so cute so you can't go wrong with any
of them thank you guys watching this is
