Oh today we're gonna be doing a
Christmas wish this video and I don't
expect anything about Christmas and I
don't even think Christmas is about the
presents I do know Christmas is in like
a week and a half but these are pretty
last-minute ideas you can either order
online or they're just things you could
probably find it nearby stores so these
are like Christmas presents you can
either get for other people or you could
ask for for yourself so if you guys
enjoy these and let's just go right on
into this also heat shout out to a clip
for sponsoring this video so thank you
so much and I will be talking about them
a little bit more later to the video I'm
not gonna be doing categories in this
video because it was that's just too
much it but so this first item is
Birkenstocks I mean wanna ampere burger
start to the longest time and I know
they are a hundred bucks but I
definitely think they're worth it's
they're super high-quality the second
one is a new phone case I splattered ice
cream all over my like velvet iPhone
case it was so cute but not true and so
a new phone case is something I want so
I got my braces off not too long ago and
and I've had the same toothbrush for
quite a while now so number three is an
electric toothbrush because first off
electric toothbrushes are pretty cool
hwhip it's actually a really good
electric toothbrush to ask for because
they're one of the most affordable on
the market they start at 25 bucks which
is a lot cheaper than other brands this
toothbrush I was like a two-minute timer
mode which is super cool and it like
buzzes every thirty seconds to tell you
to like move to a different part your
mouth plus it also comes with like a
little holder stand so like you just put
in there and then it like rests on the
counter top also just really quick the
color of this it's rose gold like that's
cute when you've had your toothbrush for
a while and the bristles start to get
all weird your you don't need buy a new
toothbrush you can just buy refills of
like toothpaste and the brush head and
they'll be delivered to you guys every
three months basically it starts at five
dollars and it's free shipping worldwide
so that's super affordable and it's very
convenient and the last thing I want to
tell you guys is that the first hundred
people that order equipped for
themselves or for a gift or someone they
get 15% off so make sure you guys visit
and get quick comm slash Marla or you
guys can check out the link in the
description box and go order yourself a
new toothbrush so the next one is plants
I
love plants fake and real just asking
for any type of plant because I feel
like they brought in a room they brought
in your house they are good for you and
yeah my next to die idea huh the next
one's a tapestry tapestries are actually
super nice because like when you don't
like them anymore you can just take them
down like fold them up and then put them
back up when you're in the mood for them
I know Urban Outfitters has tons of them
but Amazon does have quite a few cute
ones that are a lot cheaper so I check
them out too
I want whoa I want some alex jours from
ikea and if you don't know what they are
they're basically the things that every
single youtuber has those like makeup
collection drawers that would be so nice
in my room is one of the messages rooms
probably in my entire city the next
product I want is the peach palette from
truth the next product I want is the
peach palette from Too Faced and I
really want that one stick like I
thought two pretty colors that I like
the next video literally anything from
brandy melville I know that that's like
basic but at the end of the day they do
have a really cute comfy stuff the next
item is a guitar and this is something I
really really want for Christmas I play
the ukulele and the piano and I kind of
have the ukulele down and I want to
learn how to play the guitar now I just
feel like it's a lot more versatile with
like playing songs and stuff and I know
that Amazon has quite a few like decent
guitars that come in like a pack for
like 150 200 bucks a ukulele is also
something if you don't have and you want
to pick up like a new instrument but you
don't want to like if you don't want to
like take lessons learning the ukulele
is actually not that hard at all and
it's super easy that get down and
they're not that expensive to they're
like 60 bucks for a good one the next
thing I want is a set of new pajamas i
word the ugliest pajamas ever like I
have one set pajama start from Costco
from last year that are kind of like
floods on me like I have like three
inches between my ankle and the pant leg
yeah I getting a new set of pajamas also
you just like feel cute in the morning
you're like I'm wearing cute pajamas
even though I'm ugly the next thing that
you guys probably should ask for for
Christmas if you're interested is a few
I'll Robin caulking I probably
slaughtered the name I don't know how to
pronounce it but this backpack and
they're so cute and I have one myself
and I have given away heaps three now
and they are the like most high quality
backpacks like in terms of like your
price they're so nice and I totally
recommend them and they come so many
cute colors the next one is a daisy is
the Daisy by Marc Jacobs perfume but
that is my all-time favorite scent Juicy
Couture has a pretty good sense too but
the Daisy by Marc Jacobs is
and I would totally recommend that if
you want just like something fresh and
fruity a cheaper alternative for the
perfume is to get a rollerball because
you still get like the perfume but it's
a lot cheaper if you're interested in
music or something like that you want to
pursue that and getting a microphone
also microphones are just fun to like
play around with you know yeah the next
item is a new bleep a new booty okay the
next item is a new Beauty Blender and
for any girl that just like wears makeup
a new Beauty butter it would it be
really nice because my so dirty and it
always falls on the ground I always
forget to clean it there's so much
foundation probably clogged up and that
thing and it's yeah anyway so new one
would be super nice the next item is
some like pillows like really nice
memory foam pillows or just some cute
throat pulls to put on your bed because
I feel like clothes just make your bed
look so comfy and cute or even like new
couch pillows or something for your
living room the next also to go along
with the pillows is a new bedspread
because getting a new bedspread make
like cousin change up your room so much
even though it's not that big of a
difference
IKEA actually has a pretty cute once my
comforter or bread spread is from Ikea
and I really like it the next item would
be a robe because robes would be nice
when you're just like in the winter you
get out of the shower you're so cold but
you don't wanna put on clothes in and
say just a robo to be nice the next item
is for those people don't want to grow
out their hair or want to make their
hair healthier is to ask for like horse
shampoo or horse shampoo conditioner
because I use that and not definitely
like post my hair so much and then to go
along with that the next time could be
the hair skin and nail vitamins or
especially the gummies from Costco
because I'm a lot more likely to eat the
gummies okay so the next items are those
cute sailor hats I don't know what
they're called but I'll answer a picture
right here and then also to go along
with that berets those are so cute I
know you could tell them like you can
find them at forever 21
Urban Outfitters anything from glossier
or like they're especially their
skincare line cuz I know they're really
good skincare scrunchies fuzzy socks any
cute like be nice or something
especially for during the winter new
workout clothes because let me tell you
when I get a new workout clothes I'm so
motivated yeah I just want a new workout
clothes a Spotify membership because
like Spotify Premium because that would
be actually such a nice gift
like a super you school and Netflix
membership a new desk if you're
interested in that like I know I can't
have some like pretty affordable ones
that are super good new cute earrings
dainty necklaces a new journal buzz
having a new cute journal would you just
be nice to just like put down your
thoughts of something cute
stationery stuff like new pencils new
pens because those are actually things I
need but I never like get around to
buying a new blog camera
hi this one's more of an idea for you
guys because I got myself one it's maybe
a lot more motivated to vlog especially
the canon g7x is those are so good I
have one myself and I really love it
records a record player to go along with
those records I bought myself a record
even though I don't have a record player
but it was Billy eyelash so any type of
like facemask especially the glam glow
ones like the silver one or the where
what's the one that's like super puffy
like it gets really puffy a big blanket
like a big fluffy blanket just cuddling
a portable speaker because pump those
jams anywhere the seat your feet any
because that being tan is cool those
neon sign cutouts from like Urban
Outfitters I know they have a banana one
and I really really want that one one of
those lined up vanity mirrors and I know
they sell them at Costco for like 20
bucks any type of like cute books so
like journals cute books random books
like diary fan Wimpy Kid okay that's not
really anything from lush because having
new bat bombs is always like festive and
cute a chick-fil-a gift card one of
those the fun projectors because that's
so cool and the last most important a
boyfriend so this is not necessarily my
Christmas wish list they're just more
like ideas for you guys to put onto your
own at Christmas Ursula's remember that
the holiday season is not about the
Christmas presents but it's about giving
it all so I'm trying to do vlogmas so
