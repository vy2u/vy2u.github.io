gonna be doing a birthday video sorry if
you can't hear me is it solo I'm just
looking for some work clothes really
hoping I can find a spider-man costume
in an orange shirt so I'm not currently
at Goodwill which is pretty Universal
first store so I'm excited and I've been
here one other time with Avery but this
is my second time now okay so I forgot
to film this inside of the third story
but I want to quickly tell you guys
about the garage campaign that I did if
you guys did not know I had the
opportunity to go fly out to Montreal
Canada and do a campaign with a clothing
company called garage with a few other
youtubers that I'm not super good
friends with and it was such an awesome
experience and they just released it the
campaign and the photos are up and the
blogpost about it and I'm so excited to
share with you guys so if you guys want
to know all about that I'll have with a
link down below to their website and
also I did a film my experience while I
was in Montreal and if you did not see a
vlog off that also went down below they
campaign was about girl power and
bringing us girls up I will have a link
down to a video where I did talk about
the campaign along with a bunch of other
girls which was so much fun and such a
cool experience so you guys want to go
and watch that and check out their
website then and go and check out the
link down below
sadly they do not have a garage door and
Utah but if you guys do have any garage
stores near you and then go and take a
picture and it showed me cuz I'm so
excited and this is just such a cool
experience and that's about it so now we
can get back into the third row video do
cheese slide three bucks that's not bad
but they're not my face
I really wish their stories just had a
mom Jean section but it's so much easier
to find things so we don't we do an
outfit of the day so I'm currently
wearing my jacket and this or from
brandy melville and then my pants are
thrifted and my shoes are caught and I'm
not converse their vans so this Arizona
shirt I just realized that has a hole in
it so I don't think I'm gonna get this
but the only reason why picking it up is
because I have the champion logo and I'm
not even from Arizona like I've never
even we've driven through it so I'm not
a big fan wait so I can't afford a Juicy
Couture tracksuit so this will have to
do and I kind of feel like I should have
a gold chain like with a dollar sign
getting really comfortable I'm wearing
these kinda kinda remind me of like
Mickey Mouse but then they kind of
remind me of like vintage I do like them
but they're a little big around the
waist I feel like they would be cute
with like a white blouse you know maybe
I can have my grandma hand them so I
really like the pattern on the skirt but
the only problem is it's a little big
you know what she with
it could be so this shirt isn't that bad
I just feel like it's not a great
flattering but then again most of my
outfits aren't very flattering I don't
know I'm just not in love with it and so
I'm not gonna get it I just finished up
at Goodwill and I only got one item I
haven't been having much luck thrift
shopping lately and I don't know maybe
just no one's donating anything good I
got these I'm really excited because I
think they're super cute and they are
slightly larger around the waist but I
think my mom or my grandma can have them
and so I'm super excited in these will
also be cute at Disneyland because
they're kind of like Minnie Mouse
wraps up this video if you guys did
enjoy it give it a thumbs up and

next field bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
