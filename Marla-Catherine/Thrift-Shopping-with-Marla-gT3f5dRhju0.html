gonna be filming a 13 video mm-hmm so
i've been 13 in a quick second and I'm
excited film is I just finished up
filming actually so it's pretty good
success to popular do let's get out
is anyone else cold so I'm cool so
currently I am looking for jeans I
always start off in the jeans I don't
know why there's not really particular
reasons I just like to get a knocked out
stuff like that's the longest part but I
feel like searching for jeans out there
stores is probably the longest thing to
do like the longest process these jeans
are hard you don't know well they're
hard to find
there's lots of them you know you get it
yeah definitely once you find that like
one pair you're good to go one time I
found my favorite all-time favorite pair
of jeans I found at the thrift store
I busted the zipper on that baby but
it's okay I really want to get that
fixed but they take a while to find
about what to do they're totally worth
it my tip for you guys is literally look
through it I can't you don't look
through every single thing even if you
know it's not gonna fit or you know it's
not gonna be good because you never know
someone could have put something in the
wrong section and that ends up being
your size yeah cuz if I were to pick
this up and not put it over there it's
in the wrong section I would have ever
found it like I already know those like
are not gonna fit me but I looked at
them still gotta give everyone a chance
hey guys it's me this what is this
called this dragon shirt is from Urban
Outfitters I believe my fanny pack is
from Urban Outfitters with Patagonia and
then my jeans are from garage then my
shoes are Burke's ok let's go if you do
want to find some new like sportswear or
active wear that their store is a place
to go like this is brand new it
literally shows the tires on it this is
7 bucks
I do not know if I can focus or not but
that their story is so good if you guys
want to find like cargo pants stay up
about 10 of those at least the ones that
I go to so especially if you like want
to dress like Billy Eilish and you like
a lot cheaper version go to the shore
they have so much stuff like that also
the winter the winter wear section
always has good stuff during the summer
because everyone's decluttering and
getting British stuff so definitely
check that out too because then you get
the good stuff during the summer and
then you can wear it during the winter
I like the color and I like getting
these temperatures because we're soft
they're comfy that's sleeping and also I
like to wear them when I'm wearing my
tank tops okay so this is the next item
it's like a yellow zip up zip up this is
it I really love this I feel like it's a
cute summer color and this could be so
cute with like a patterned shirt
underneath it's a mom jeans and converse
it could look really cute it's really
fancy like that and so I'm gonna get it
it's a yes for me okay so this next item
this is that what you would call it okay
this is from this next one is a white
pullover but it's from the men's section
it reminds me of the guy from The
Princess Diaries the r8 boyfriend I tell
you what Laura waiting how about a foot
massage thank you I'm going to work I'm
gonna go work at the golf course this is
I feel like I look like my grandma it's
not a bad thing I just mmm it's enough
for me
okay so just not this is supposed to
like button up all the way but it just
like now looks like I'm going to a
funeral I know it's not that bad but
like what do you think I don't know I
just guess it's not my thing
weapons if I was can do I like this no
but like really do you think if I was
like tan for what I stole look like
count dracula i mean these are a little
big know like I'm not I promise I'm not
fat shaming I'm just saying they're a
little big on me
follow my one-hour plan to see how I can
get results like this I think I've seen
something like these on the brandy Mahal
outside they look cute I don't know
they're different they're not your usual
jeans
everything that is purchased was for $14
that is why a thrift what in the world
