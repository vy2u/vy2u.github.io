it is going to be a fall try on haul and
I know they're like Marla you stir the
batter school stuff so early and now
you're starting the fall stuff so really
but honestly I'm not because I've
already seen either your fall videos
actually all the clothes except for one
item is from Saul and if you guys want
to go check them out and go check out
their awesome store online store then
you can go check out the description box
and all the links will be down below and
real quick um life has gone so busy with
school and just extra curricular
activities and so now we're going to
have scheduled post every Sunday
expecting a video for me so this first
item is a little bit different from my
usual style but I just thought it's a
little funny you can accidentally get it
in a size too big so um it looks like
this it has the front of like a weenie
dog but then you go to the back and it's
the but at the weenie dog can you hold
it up like this you see like the
full-length weenie dog
you guys see that so I got two shirts
from shuffle and this other one is
probably my favorite one honestly my
brother was like Monica's the third day
we're not sure but no one cares because
it was still summer um but it is so cool
it's like this like I don't beige like a
yellowish beige very natural color and
that it has like Saturn I think that's
our that little orange juice with sweet
Saturn and then Earth and then as a NASA
satellite with like the moon and stars
maybe it's so earthy and like it's not
that like this is now really like
actually follow those are not knives can
be classified to summer if you guys want
but this is fall um it is a turtleneck
sweater dress and all right I love
sweater dresses and second off I love
turtlenecks and so it is very very
different but it is almost like a like
very simple prom dress because it is so
long and it's just like very pretty very
pretty natural like baby
and um hashtag missing might be here
it's so fun to also like spit in like
the dress that goes up and you feel like
you're in like one of those princess
diary movies the next thing comes awful
is this jacket and I saw on the website
and it's like oh my gosh I need that my
closet I think it's so cool um my dad
was like that looks like an 80s bumper
jacket like the ones the pilot to skewer
and now I think about it it really does
but I don't care it's like this is a
very pretty pastel blue and the texture
of the jacket is not my favorite but
that's on the outside so it doesn't
really matter to me but on the inside
it's this very warm wool now the next
thing now the next thing I got from za
hole is probably my favorite thing that
I got and it's these overalls I was on
the first day school just to show how
much I love these and they are these
overalls I already said that it's not
exactly bleach wash but it has like
those like you guys can see it like head
smells like like hints apply it in the
dark so I love those overalls if you're
gonna even check out da Phil's website
and get something get the whole world
now the next item that froome's awful is
I know it's supposed to be a fall haul
but it's awful is known for their
swimsuits and I just I couldn't I
couldn't help myself
so the first one is a bikini but quite
frankly I do not like bikinis at all I
love the high waisted bombs that it came
with so like free at the top they're
like they look like a Jean material and
then they have like the white buttons so
I'd recommend getting so much duffel
bathing suits because not only are they
cute and they fit right but second off
or third off they are so cheap like like
not like the quality but the price is
very cheap so go check them out
especially when the summer comes back or
if you live in Australia or something go
get them now
the next beta 2 is um it's different at
the top is like this really cool eyes
take pattern if you look up close it's
like a green
really and that's why it looks like it's
kind of like blue or whatever and it is
so comfy and then the bottoms are just
matching black ones anyway I just love
the look of the baby - especially on and
next time from duffel is this person I
got I've been looking for like a small
purse but I saw this one's awful I
thought it was so cute and it caves in
so many different colors and it is like
a baby pink so backed up baby pea I've
been obsessed with anything if you guys
haven't noticed but I am so thank you
thoughtful for sending me these clothes
very generous with you guys um but if
you guys I really go check out their
website oh sure got their clothes
there's so many so much more stuff to go
see and to buy and we'll have all the
links down in the description box and a
link to their website go check them out
the last but not least before I forget I
need to show you guys my deed is that I
got I won't have been wanting ad super
chars forever and I finally like got the
courage to buy them and um I was
originally planning on getting the black
and white ones and I think they're
gorgeous I love them and I know they
match with a lot of things but on tumblr
like a week before I was like I'm
actually gonna buy them I saw on tumblr
these ones and they call them the
unicorn adidas because they're so
magical and I was like wow that would
complete my life
really and so I got them na I can say it
was a good decision
I love the holographic pink toe I like
it that was the last offense awful I
still have these awesome and to show you
guys I got these cute ear climbers from
is awful and I'm they're super
comfortable I even forgot he's wearing
that might wear them for the whole day
and then it dries so it's wearing them
with them today which is awesome thanks
