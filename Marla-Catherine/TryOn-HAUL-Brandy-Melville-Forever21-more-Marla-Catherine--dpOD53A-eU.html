forever 21 and let me tell you forever
21 is this store where it's either
they'd like to good stuff or this wise
where these two on business like hey
guys its Marla hi guys it is Marla and
if you're new here hi I'm very glad you
found my channel it's about time or if
you're just a viewer your subscriber
what's up my fam my dudes wow I actually
don't even have a name for you guys but
I feel like that's like you guys are in
animals and I don't want to like name
you so that's why I don't have like a
name but today we're gonna be filming a
haul
I actually was planning on filming a
hairstyles later today but as you can
tell this was not wanting to cooperate
all the hairstyles were turning out
really ugly so I'm probably gonna have
to refill that one some other time but
today I'm filming a haul so I'll be off
to fun I'm actually going to San
Francisco tomorrow so when this video is
up I'll probably be in San Francisco
already but I'm super excited and so
that is why I went shopping for a lot of
these items is because they wanted to
have some clothes for the trip yeah okay
so without the feathers of the do's
let's get on into this hole that was
really sarcastic let's just get started
honestly I just know I want to quickly
apologize for my appearance today like I
don't know this happens like every day
mom are you cooking again rip headphone
users every time my mom cooks that
happens love you mama
okay so the first door I went to was
PacSun by the way I filmed like 15
minutes of this video and the microphone
wasn't even on some really question of
fingers hope that it actually is but I
went to PacSun first and most of time I
don't go to pax and I actually just shot
for brandy melville because they have my
actual brand new mobile store inside of
Utah you didn't even care but I told you
anyway so the first item I got from
there was the shirt that I'm wearing I
don't know how to pronounce this I've
never been here I don't even know where
this is on the planet but I really like
the way that this shirt fit in the way
it looks so I bought it I think it's st.
quakes st. Croix I'm gonna assume the X
is silent st. Croix or st. Croix I'm so
sorry if I'm messing that up I really
liked it the way this shirt fit it's
like not cropped but it has
it's like the its rolled at the end
anyway I like the way this looks and I
think this was like twenty dollars
roughly I'll say the prices in the halls
I always appreciate it when people do
that yeah I'm not trying to brag or
anything I'm just saying the price of
item the next and last item I got from
Brandi was these pants and these pants
were $40 but I normally don't find pants
that I really like the way these fit
like if I find a pair of pants
must-attend they're too big in the waist
or there's short I really like that the
way they spit and so I thought they were
worth a price and they seemed pretty
high quality so I got these and I really
really like them I am probably to wear
them everything secret Cisco because I
really like the way that they fit shout
out to Brandi for having a cute okay so
the next one I went to was this it's
like basically Utah boutique so if you
don't mean Utah don't even know if they
have an online store
that's called sole boutique and I found
this super oversized red sweater I love
this so much I got so many compliments
when I wore it to school the other day
it was so comfortable like almost fell
asleep in a few my classes because it's
like a big blanket I've been obsessed
with the red lately so the next place I
went to was Ulta and I only got two
items about to the benefit goof-proof
brow pencil and I've been obsessed with
this it's super similar to the elf brow
pencil but I got this one cuz I feel
like actual eyebrow product lasts a
little bit longer it's also $20 more so
this was like 20 bucks anyway oh by the
way this sweater was like 20 bucks and
normally it's like 45 and then the next
item I got from there was after like a
million years of it being released I got
the Tarte shape tape I couldn't sealer
and if I'm gonna be 109 percent honest
with you I think that this is kind of an
average concealer anyway I don't know I
don't think it's worth the price forty
bucks but then again it's like it works
it's good but I don't know if I would
spend forty bucks on it again then the
next door I went to was another Utah
boutique and it this one is called Hope
Avenue I like this color no one can hate
on me because like I'm just always gonna
love this color right so it's like a
pair green my sister says it looks like
a peon but it's pear green okay they're
super I don't even know how to explain
the style these I don't own any pants
that really are like this but I just
like the bow I just like how you can tie
it in the front I like the quality of
these these are like 25 bucks which i
think is pretty good for a pair of pants
that I really like okay so the next one
when she was forever 21 and let me tell
you forever 21 is this store where it's
either
lots of good stuff or this why is
garbage to one business
like there's no in between it's one or
the other and this time I went there was
lots of good stuff if you guys watched
my Christmas wish list I'm pretty sure I
put up my Christmas wish list but I
wanted one of those cute like engineer
hats that I think are so cute and I
wanted to Urban Outfitters and they're
like 50 bucks no joke and I just could
not bring myself to buy it 50 bucks for
a hat like are they kidding I went to
forever 21 and I like felt like crying
tears of joy because they sold these
hats for legit $13 and if they are still
selling these while you're watching this
haul go ahead and pick them up I always
think these are the cutest heads ever is
this plaid for his kingdom it's a
mystery really like these hats and I
think this hat is even cute with this
outfit with some like yellow bands like
if you style it I think they're cute in
photos I think they're cute in real life
anyway and then I got a basic white
t-shirt because I feel like you can
never get enough of these just basic
clothing items they always disappear in
your closet and you're like I thought I
had one but psych I don't and I also got
another one it's the same style except
it's pink and it's like a baby pink and
I think this would be cute with overalls
or something just a nice layering piece
and then the last item I got from there
was this it's a body suit but I always
wear body suits like overalls because
then you don't like have to be concerned
about like tucking it in constantly but
I just think it looks like a big wednesy
it's really weird actually I really like
the color and I like the print it just
looks like grandma ish and I really like
things that look good grandma this is
also on sale for I think 10 bucks I got
this a few weeks ago we went to journeys
and I found this treasure I posted about
out my snapchat this is a pretty lit
okay you can just end subscribe now this
was literally 5 bucks and I was just
like sign me up
I love bucket hats - they're a close
favorite um a close second - my favorite
hat
which is this I went to Nordstrom Rack
and I felt really bougie while shopping
there even though it's like the discount
Nordstrom Nordstrom is so expensive like
are they kidding
there was a t-shirt dress there for like
$2 new isn't not even that cute
but so they had this and this is my this
makes me feel like I'm 9 again and it's
the pink sugar perfume if you get the
chance to smell this it smells like
sugar and I really like it this is
normally $60 and I got it for 35 that
sign does biz my head for 30 bucks yes
please okay then the next item I got
so excited if you've been following me
for the past week you already know
because I literally post so much about
this I have my yellow oven clunking I
got this for my birthday back in May and
this has been with me everywhere this is
my purse
my brother says it's my trashcan because
there's so much trash in it this is my
school backpack this is what I used for
my carry-on when I travel this is what I
use for when we go and I go to shoots
like I pack the camera in here so it's
my camera bag I also use it for when
we're doing look books it's becomes like
a little suitcase they put all my
clothes in here literally this is used
for everything and then it's just like
used for my purse when I'm just going to
the mall and I want to just put like my
keys in here or my wallet I literally
put everything in there so I bought
myself a miniature version and it's like
this really pretty burnt orange color I
really like it I'm probably gonna start
posting about this all the time too but
its miniature version because I just
used it as a purse but this it fits so
much stuff like are you kidding
mother-daughter goals don't talk to me
or my son ever again that wasn't funny
okay
oh and then to wrap up this entire haul
I'm so excited about this I got some
film for my camera I want to be able to
also make like a Polaroid wall I want to
just take lots of memories and this is
anyway I like the color blue so that's
why I got it and I highly recommend and
then to wrap this up I have my shirt
that got so I have my blue one which
it's kind of hard to see like in person
you can see it but on camera it's kind
of hard to pick up the logo I have this
shirt in different colors so I got this
red one too and I'm so excited about
this like I love the lovely shirt so
much and a lot of you guys are asking
questions so I'm just gonna quickly
answer some of those questions you guys
are always asking what size I got I got
it in size small they're asking like
does it run big what does it run like oh
it runs like it runs a little bit on the
looser side and it's pretty long so if
you want more of an oversized look just
size up yeah so it's me this is 60%
cotton and then 40 cent percent
polyester so it's super soft I went I
ran this through the wash and the logo
didn't even come off like it's very high
quality anyway those are just some
questions if you guys have any questions
about the about the shirt that you can
DME or message me or comment and I'll
try to reply back the campaign ends
anything in 8 days or whenever this
video is published so the campaign ends
soon basically so go ahead and get it
now because this is only
you can't get it after it's gone it's
gone so go ahead and get the shirt while
you can I'm super excited about it I'm
really proud of it and I love it a lot
