success you all this is brand-new from
forever 21 and I'm kind of low-key
debating on getting it literally has the
tags on and everything forever tie one

four items but they're for very desired
items like I've been lined them at other
stores and so I'm sorry I thought I'm

about the skirt but I end up getting
excellent four bucks and it's cute the

deep pockets which is also early night

like my when I got there shopping I
found the perfect one it fits so good
and just a simple monk black tick with
monkeys and I got this one for five
bucks which is still super good and by
Ann Taylor is who that is and the last
thing I got was I'm so
