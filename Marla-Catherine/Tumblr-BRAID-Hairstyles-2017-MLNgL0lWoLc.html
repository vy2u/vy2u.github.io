my channel I was at m.i.a and I haven't
put in a week so today's show is going
to be a twist on my tumblr or sales
video you're going to like that one so
I'm doing that video except it's a new
braised edition and so they're all
passing to disgrace and you guys I think
we're sure alex is going to do so
because cause I thought you are geared
towards more like medium length hair but
obviously if you have long hair than
like you cancel TV I buy me right here
so if I'm not looking in the camera I'm
looking down here so don't like freak
out you know I started out with this
super cool hairstyle that I really like
and I saw it on this any guess on
Pinterest or something goes about the
inner corner of your eyebrow of one of
your eyebrows and then go in and parshat
so I slept on my hair wet and so it
dried all weird so I'm gonna be using a
spray bottle I came in into what it down
I'm going to start a Dutch braid for me
I have to start my braids off really
tight or else my bangs will fall out and
starting off wet is also so much easier
to if you have bangs are start off wet
and make them quick so I before I go and
I rubberband this braid I'm going to go
in and pancake it okay so now I don't
have that different pancakes I'm going
to go in and take a small elastic in
this elastic it's temporary so now that
it's secured and I'm going to go in and
I'm going to screw all my hair to the
opposite side that does another brace
why I come I put it into with a clear
elastic of middle and rubber band
those legs TT point join one together
the view will be cool I want to very
very subtly like right her to twist it
and put it into the blood flow it didn't
work that is color about it is
rubberband that so I now a minor
spraying and I heard great this side
works it along my physical there just in
her great everything I just inhaled
talking so we're going to go pull out
some hair and decide to kind of even it
out and take out some canvas like
clothes own house I obviously like not
biking or anything like I'm not too good
at hair so people picnic ears we go head
over to kick roll fair self channel cuz
well do you want better life so this is
the finish your thought used to perk you
and it's super easy to it doesn't take
you much skills coming from a person to
L do what feel okay so the next
hairstyle is going to be a result I go
to one my recent videos will be doing a
high you can Renji okay something like
that okay so when do you hear a party
down the middle I'm going to be doing a
zigzag heart so you're going to start
right here and literally just take your
fingers and dig that I get across the
part one I search it's going to look
like what that is I and then you're
going to separate all the hairs and when
you're done so right now it doesn't so
that's about that and then you're gonna
go and you're going to wet down Scott
wait stays in place so then I'm going to
go in and so how we're gonna help you
just wear it normal but I'm going to go
in and then a part of just regular down
the middle in the back and then I'm
going to is grade them basically
a rubber band
rubber band it around the slot a little
bit past the bottom of your ear okay so
then I'm going to take the braids into
the back pull out the lower band and
rubber band it to one low so that you
cannot leave it kind of splits back like
this but I'm going to go ahead and plot
some pieces and pancake my three okay so
this is basically a high osika so
milkmaid braids they look reduced to one
really clothing but then it's like a
little bun in the back it's cute and I
really like this exciting secure one
yeah I was school if I went to public
school but I kind of don't so I love
this one okay so he like this all I I
realize that those first two kernels but
it seems home with us widget so if you
start off you're kind of like I'm a
twist on house club and if I chill so
just go to the RT eyebrows and then make
that your house up that's how much hair
you should be using for your house at
home I kind of look a little weird and
then rubberband that okay so now a super
success I kinda how to leave it right
now that are letting like my face don't
think that right now then we're going to
go in on the sides you're going to grab
a section of hair you're gonna divide it
just into two pieces
so that if you guys want to make this
more braided you can go in and keep the
point oh that we put in the hop-up and
braid that I'm going to do that
so yeah back to this Han child isn't
super - and it's not as like blue-gray
it's more like so it's awesome one is
super simple especially if you're in a
rush and you just write your hair down
middle or wherever you guys desire go
predator problem you know need my bangs
up so I'm just going to quickly do that
so we may be just like this rectangle
your illusion and Philip
the
now I'm done with the official system
corner and rubber-banded okay so this is
my hairstyle this one's my like a like
if we're going to the beach or something
a full B nice so just a super pancake
you can do it on the other side too but
the fingers are hurting and I want to
