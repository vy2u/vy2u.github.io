week's video I'm going to be showing you
guys my everyday makeup look and this is
also kind of what I do on my photo
shoots if you guys were ever wondering
this is what I like to kind of stay
along the lines of and without further
ado let's get right on into the video to
start off my everyday makeup routine I'm
going to take the arm not pronounces so
this is the Nydia it's not even right
wait this is the Nivea men um post shave
balm and this is what I'm going to start
my makeup off with my makeup look off
with and you're probably like what does
that even do well coats of mine in Seoul
introduce this to the world
Kylie Jenner and um you you can use this
as a primer and it moisturizes and so
it's great for using that and it has
like a sticky texture so when you put on
your foundation or your or concealer
whatever you put on it will stick a lot
better and I'll stay longer and that
it's it's great it's it's it's grand so
I'm going to now take it and I just put
a little small dose integer I just felt
a little bit on the back of my hand
and then I'm going to take the Too Faced
Born This Way Foundation I promised you
a Kate Wayne foundation eyes I just
don't like wearing foundation so I'm
gonna take this is like dripping
everywhere it's pretty um liquidy but
I'm just taking that and I do like like
not even that one pump like not even and
then I'm going to take the end of my
brush and I'm just going to swirl that
together so now this just acts as a
primer and a foundation all-in-one and a
moisturizer so I'm just going to know
I'm kind of like myself and then take my
brush the this side and I'm just going
to start to apply that all over my face
in the eat it needed areas this smells
like aftershave
like it for the next look I'm going the
next look the crap the next item of
business I'm gonna move on to them brows
so I'm just going to take the Maybelline
brow define and fill duo and I've talked
about this a ton time so I'm not going
to talk to Joanna today and just kind of
outline I'm eyebrows and I like to start
in the middle and then kind of fan it
out and I'll just blend whatever it's
excess into the corner of my brow
Johnson toons
so if you're like me and do not like to
spend 20 bucks on a piece of product
that's like that but that much then you
should go to Ulta you're a local old
post or this thing I'm telling you it is
the perfect dupe for benefits gimme brow
literally $2.99 I don't quote me on that
I don't know what's around there and
it's the same exact product I've tried
out both of them and this one is the
same exact thing and it's made by
essence I'm just going to take it and
then brush up my eyebrows so it also
sets my eyebrows at the same time flick
flicker now eyebrows are flicker
my eyebrows are now down and so I'm
going to move on to the actual eye now
taking my shadow I don't even know how
you pronounce it my shishito favorite
Irish curler ever in the history of ever
I'm going to take it and we curl my
naturally straight eyelashes but why I
up she's have been getting longer
because I've been using babe wash and
let me tell you if you I can say if you
religiously put it on every night it
will work then taking my Maybelline lash
sensational full fan effect waterproof
mascara I'm going to put this onto my
eyelashes
and then I'm gonna move on to my bottom
lashes I'm going to bronze my face and I
don't do this every day but I'd like to
do it for fun or on special occasions or
functions and then just go and I take
this thing I might find my cheekbone go
right straight underneath it and that's
where I'm going to put my bronzer on now
I'm just going to focus on my lips
I don't like to wear lipstick but I do
love to wear this it's the kylie matte
liquid lipstick and before I do that I
am going to moisturize my lips just a
little bit by using this just regular
lip balm from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works now this
is in the shade exposed and let me tell
you it is so pretty and they smell so
good
I can either see
this finishes my makeup look and I just
like to say thank you guys for tuning in
and staying till the end it means a lot
to me and I'm going to do it for the
first time ever
Marla Katherine if I put this in the
history book we're going to do a thumbs
up goal and the goal is going to be
