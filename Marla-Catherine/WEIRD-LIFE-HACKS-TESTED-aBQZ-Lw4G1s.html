Katherine and today's video is going to
be kind of stupid like facts testers
because you know we all get a little bit
curious sometimes they want to know Oh
without further ado let me just quickly
explain what's going on here dealing on
me to feed your ham in my video and so
you know you gotta please the bay and so
without further ado let's get right on
into this video first up is Pam spray on
nails so apparently if you paint your
nails and then you don't put top go on
and then you put Pam spray over it and
then you wipe it off immediately your
nails will be instantly dry
so apparently if you spray this on your
non plush and then wipe it off instantly
it will be instantly dry what the heat
this happy is a waste of time and money
effort in life have you ever wondered if
your breath smelt good or not I wonder
that every day so if you want to know
what your breath smells like you just
have to lick your wrist and then smell
it in that apparently it's supposed to
tell you what your breath smells like
this is smelling this game you so if you
guys are up to date on my channel you'll
know that I can help by T things I just
can't it's part it's in my blood spicy
runs in my blood
oh so apparently if you eat something
really spicy spicy spicy and you can't
handle it eat some up spoonful of sugar
marilla you have to do this for the
videos I'm here and okay this little
dome and it's where you take a red
lipstick you put it underneath your eye
bags and barely supposed to cover them
all up and a few of the guys have been
catching on I'm realizing that I talk
like Miranda sings sometimes so don't
think I have some weird speech problem
I'm going to be taking my NYX or NYX
liquid suede kind of free right here if
you put it in this
shape it helps you gonna do the other
eye so I think this better work or else
that's like always just a perfectly fine
lipstick oh why are there out it you can
always put some on your lips now I got a
concealed concealed don't feel do it
then no they have red lipstick
underneath their eyes now I'm a
concealer and I've had my mom gave this
is a a heirloom this was handed down to
me by my mother it's just me get a P so
I'm taking my brand new Beauty butter
and I'm using a lot of trust in this
because I have a feeling this might work
thanks babes for watching
you're all amazing and if you remember
to give this video a bra thumbs up for
weird life hacks and whether they work
or not they're always flipping a test
remember to hit the subscribe button and
to join the more eliminators see that
sounds so loud thanks for watching love
you bye
there you go go this is how to give your
Beautyblender a hard cut 101 take some
scissors you just want to ever so
slightly cut the ridge there's no rules
when it comes to this it seriously looks
brand new and I was like this really see
the kind of rough texture you know I'll
give you that not really airbrushed
effect here's a little bonus one for all
you guys said stay to the end of the
video if you take your applesauce and
most applesauce tins our covers are made
out of tin foil series will come to bend
them and I use this all the time at
school
that's so disgusting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
