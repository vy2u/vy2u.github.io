of makeup brushes and I love a bamboo or
they're not called bamboo they're called
the Eco tools and I use this one today
and it is literally so soft like I've
never had a brush this off it's maybe my
mom knows that I love to paint and to be
creative like that I guess so she got me
a bunch of just like paint just you know
red green and then I don't I pretty sure
she ordered these on Amazon but I don't
know but she got me a ton of canvases
campuses are so awesome especially for
just like if you put like a bigger
project and then you're able to hang
them in your room and they look so cute
and Tumblr and be there yourself so
that's awesome my parents always got us
just a new calendar every year I love
the ocean and oceanology and so my mom
got me this calendar and just a bunch of
different beaches and I think it is so
pretty and it actually matches like the
theme of my Miriam link Oh
next up it is just so much sticky notes
we just got a bunch of these sticky
dough pads are too exciting but they are
super useful and I'm not really into
toys or anything but my I always can use
a good can of FLARP now next up is just
kind of like the hygienic stuff I don't
know about you but my parents always I
can always rely on like a Gucci fresh or
something every Christmas so to start
off I did get a loofah but I already
used it so I didn't like want to take
out of the shower whatever cuz it's like
wet and gross yeah so basically just
like a bunch of like body washes and
just like mouthwash you know just like
that usual stuff that you always somehow
nee but don't really buy and next up for
clothing is I'm wearing are only got
three are
because I honestly feel like I have too
much clothes I know it sounds like Brian
or whatever by honestly like I don't
have enough closet space for them so I
don't really ask me that much clothes
except for everything so I got this
really cute shirt from careless and
careless I clogged with many times but I
also buy stuff from them because I just
love so much I love their company anyway
so it's it's really pretty jade green
and it's like the a similar style of a
surefire I thought it's a pretty long
sleeve and it's like that peplum that's
flowy it's so cute and then next up are
these sweats that I got from my mom
hashtag cheerleading skills come to me
the last clothing I am a from forever 21
they look like plain of black jeans but
then they have these really cute slits
at the knee and it's just like a simple
slit which i think is so cute and it
just adds that like extra and their
jeans but they feel like leggings next
up on what what I got for Christmas is I
was better than glitter life so except
when I got this it's the little
dictionary fashiona by Christian
Christian diode or New York
