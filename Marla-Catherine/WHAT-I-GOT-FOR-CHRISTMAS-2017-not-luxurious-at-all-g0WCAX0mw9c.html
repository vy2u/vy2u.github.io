were gone I've probably eaten more sugar
and lost two days and I have and like
the past five months like it's bad first
off I'm wearing a bra gonna wear pajamas
I don't know what I look like but I'm
like not dressed like you normally hey
guys it's marla is the make sure it's
audio on hey guys it is marla and i
definitely don't look my best right now
so don't don't comment no just all fight
you hey guys so is marla it is December
25th it's Christmas so I'm gonna filming
a Christmas haul so first things first I
got a new pair of pajamas and I got
really festive and I moved the Christmas
tree across the room just to have it in
this video see you guys there be
grateful I have the worst flood pajamas
like they cut off like mid-calf they're
so ugly and some of moms like I'm gonna
give you some new video so that's what I
got and then she also got me a robe I
did not expect this but it's really soft
so thanks mom
oh sorry thanks Santa the next thing I
got is this these gloves don't really
ever go outside and that's why I'm so
white so that's why I don't know if I'm
gonna need these or not but hi on one
side and then bye on the other because I
am feisty like that what is his Dustin I
can't literally like why it's a weird
wine and sleep at all last night since
Christmas Eve so my sister and I also
got our family a family trip so I'm
super excited about that I can't tell
you guys where yet because but you guys
will end up finding out later 2018 so
that's super exciting the next thing I
got was this it's funny because I
literally like bought something really
similar to this and then my mom cut it
for me for Christmas it's like a
pullover yeah says New York and I wanna
go to any work so bad I literally love
this oh this is from brandy melville but
these literally are so soft so thank you
the next item is literally love these so
much I've already eaten like me and a
lot of those the next item I got was
this cosmic organ basically this is my
mom trying to tell me to get my act off
together because I've the messiest dust
and all of you talk it's literally so
bad and so my mom bought me this desk
organizer and not
super-nice who couldn't wait without
looking like an iron this next item is
super cute and I'm actually sent the
link to my mom and then I forgot that I
sent a link to her so it was a nice
surprise but if it's the one question a
day a five-year journal and basically
it's this super cute blue tiffany blue
journal and it has one question a day
like the title says and it goes on for
five years it's just a bunch of
questions that like make you think about
your day and then you write just a few
sentences down about it and then you
just have to literally not write much in
this journal so it's good for me because
it's just something quick you can do but
you can still document stuff so I really
like this and I think they sold it out
Urban Outfitters for like 15 bucks or
something and my mom gone Amazon Prime
for like 10 so go check out Amazon Prime
okay the next item I got were these spa
buddies they're basically just super
fancy socks that you like put on because
it's cold so the next item I got was
this so these are like some stocking
stuffers but I got the pink grapefruit
cleansing towelettes the makeup remover
wipes so these are super nice and
honestly makeup wipes are like the best
thing ever because we're just like
greasy you just want to like wipe it off
without washing your face those are good
a portable battery and this actually I I
was probably a little bit more stoked
about this then my mom thought I was
gonna be because okay I have the iPhone
7 I got it I literally Apple was just
you know they like destroyed the
previous phone that way you have to buy
the new one but I got a portable battery
so this will be super nice to just put
in my backpack or something and then my
phone won't die on me or if it does then
I could charge it next thing I got
because I'm trying to be healthy this
new year and so these will be really
nice snacks to have are the Justin's
vanilla almond butter if you don't know
what these are they're literally the
best things ever and they taste like
frosting when they're just pure on
butter and so they're like super healthy
for you they're the best things ever the
sillim at Walmart and I would highly
recommend these especially if you just
want a quick to go snack so like pack
these my lunch bags anyway they're the
best hands down love love those and then
I just got like this monochrome no
polish no boss was always fun I find a
fact in the fifth grade I painted my
nails every day like I kid you not like
you could ask my friends cute polish was
my youtube channel like like I would
really love that YouTube channel so much
I painted my nails everyday like I
remember being
so proud of my rubber duckie nouns that
turned out a lot better than I thought I
would I got pretty good anyway so I have
like a big collection and I'll polish
this will be nice to add to so so I then
I got some hubba bubba gump is going so
good and then my super sweet sister
she's literally the bus I just like to
say thank you so much I'm gonna love you
I have gone through like at least five
Daisy roller balls like I'm obsessed
with that but so my sister surprised me
and she got me of the Daisy Marc Jacobs
perfume and I just like to say thank you
so much over Lana this is what it looks
like it's super cute by the way I saw
that like Daisy Marc Jacobs like
sponsored a lot of youtubers so hit me
up because this is my favorite scent in
the history of ever
I don't know what it is about it but it
smells so good also yesterday we saw the
new Star Wars I think kylo Ren is hot so
comment down below if you think Iran is
hot or not yes I gotta get a pack like
no one expected that they came out of
nowhere so it was a really nice surprise
pleasant surprise anyway and also like I
feel like he he has a little bit good in
him so if they make that flourish the
good he could be the next it model so
I'm just saying I was I was supporting
him from now so yeah okay the most
exciting gift of them all who am i you
Caillat lee so i can wait Joma strong
like a tune I still need to remove the
sticker I got a guitar I do not know how
to play before I filmed this video I
learned like two chords so I'll try to
play those for you guys right now so if
you guys have any like guitar beginner
books you know and a comma those down
below because I know that was super then
I got this chord down
so when I learned how to play the guitar
more I'll probably cover a few songs
this is e minor I think and then this is
D major but I want to learn how to like
the Jack Johnson songs like the banana
pancakes I'm so also I get to talk to my
missionary brother so I'm so excited for
that we're gonna FaceTime him today and
that will be so much fun yeah my brother
