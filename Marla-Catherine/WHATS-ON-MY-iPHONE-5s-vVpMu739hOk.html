going to be a what's my iPhone I had a
iPad Mini 4 generation which is the
iPhone 5s I know it's kind of like 4
years ago but it's a phone and I've
never had one before and so I'm just
really static and super happy because
this is like awesome by me Mabel the
text I mean I was able to do that before
on the iPod but like I didn't have Wi-Fi
but it was so cool excited my first
conversation with my friend Oliver with
no bike-o I belong at coops in my
opinion that you guys might want to
download yourself or you just want to
know what's on my phone so let's start
with I have and starting in the top left
corner I have my messages and then the
one right next to that is calendar then
photos and then camera and it's the
first top row and the next row after
that starting at the far left again is
weather clock maps and notes and these
are all just kind of a generic Apple ads
that are just installed with different
and on the next row it goes reminders
iTunes Store app store and settings and
after that it was FaceTime calculator
mill and then Amazon and Amazon I do
have that out because I find that we my
family's downs on a lot and so we just
have to go on it and I waited on to type
of the website every time if you click
on my social media folder you will find
the top row containing YouTube Instagram
and Spotify so YouTube obviously you
guys already know that other channels
are watching right now and then after
that it's Instagram and on Instagram if
you click on that you'll see that I love
my Marla Cochran account if you guys
want to go
hashtag self promo you guys want to go
follow me on there it's just Marla
Kathryn so in this fight if I app it's
just all the music that I like to listen
to on a daily basis you guys can go
follow me on there at Marla Kathryn
underscore underscore my I got their
next roaster on the far left is Twitter
and then Tumblr and then snapchat so
Twitter
I finally got
i AMA had a London chill like two days
ago so instead of underscore mother
Catherine like Spotify it's more like a
throne underscores that makes any sense
if you guys notice I'm only following
three people and tanushka
del Brian and he's good I didn't know
Dylan Orion has a Twitter that was so
cool because actually has like the
verified checkmark and I didn't think
you had any social media he did not have
an Instagram you didn't have like
YouTube didn't have I'm just so like not
about that so I just been following a
lot of fan pages to see photos of them
and then he has a Twitter so I'm still
happy about that links to my all my
social media accounts will be done in
the downbar after that row it is the SEO
following the SEO is just Hulu and
Netflix so I have Hulu Netflix because I
like to watch them just I like the fact
that I'm able to watch Hulu Netflix when
everyone for a bright one I like to
watch Spongebob and Drake and Josh but
on Netflix my little sister's been
watching the show Punk'd and I just been
watching that with her so in the next
cooler it says fashion and it weather is
in there is hmm Polly Bohr and forever
21 and H&amp;amp;M and forever 21 they are here
that asked because it's easier to shop
when there instead going online
I know it's um first of all problems but
that's why I have the apps and they're
also really good for inspiration for
clothes the app in the middle is called
Polly boy and that just helps you find
clothes that like if you search up like
a red velvet jacket like a bunch of God
filled with chocolates will come up and
then it can like give you the best price
the next folder is called a random and I
don't it's not exactly random it's just
a bunch of apps that I either don't use
that often or just like they didn't fit
in another folder and then LDS tools
it's just and not that most people use
and Skyview free is just an app where
you if you it's at nighttime and you
hold up to the sky can match up the
constellations which is super cool and
on the last page there's just one more
app and it is the seven minute workout
and the last but not least it folder is
games and I'm not too big on video games
but for those times that I do want to
play it it's always
my favorite ones on campus the first job
is pottery and that's your snapper it's
like virtual pottery you able to form
and decorate it and it's really fun and
relaxing they'd like these really cool
sound effects in there the next up is
Miranda scenes
theaters back off and I love Miranda
sings the next up is fruit ninja and
it's just a classic of where as the
fruit is being like thrown at you we
have to like precise in half and last up
in that folder is tiny wings is it's an
older one but it's so much fun it's kind
of like it's just where it's like a
little bird and you have to like make it
fly seal flight help see how far it can
fly and before it almost nighttime and
that's a wrap I'm just bringing back the
old school fun and it's not even that
old Oliver just texted me this track and
