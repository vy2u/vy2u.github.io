to be a Christmas flash winter edition
morning greeting sorry I blank right
there so that's what today's video is
going to be and I just to let you know
so fYI we like relocating so many times
for this intro and outro so y'all better
appreciate it and so let's just get
right into the video I like to start off
my mornings by waking up of course and
then checking Instagram in YouTube just
like every other person in this world
then right after that I like to give my
bae doing O'Bryan and kiss because he's
doing alright so I like to watch some
YouTube videos while I'm doing my makeup
because it gives me some company stuff
like that in the video that I'm watching
right now is a video from far above
rubies so I just like to conceal and
then blend it with the Beauty Blender
and then put on some I'm Terra redness
cream
so next up is brushing my teeth and I
normally do this before my cup but today
I did it after so it next up is brushing
my hair and I use this wet brush and it
I like using it because it makes it so
it doesn't hurt after brushing your hair
from coming out of the shower and then I
just parted my hair on the right side so
I decided to be a little bit more
festive today and make some apple pie
pancakes and I use this recipe by
chocolate-covered Katie if you guys want
to go check out her recipe will be in
the description box the lights are
turned way down low let it snow let it
snow let it snow when we find I like to
listen to some Christmas music that sets
the mood and here's a tip don't bring
the pancakes because I did that and then
I had to remake them but they end up
tasting good so don't worry so I put on
some syrup and of course some whipping
cream and sorry I like whispering
everywhere and then I like to watch a
Christmas movie of course so I turned on
elf and elf is the best so what I'm
wearing is some combat boots from go
Jane and some jeans from Aeropostale and
then a sweatshirt hoodie or whatever you
want to call it from H&amp;amp;M and a t-shirt
by gap and then I spread on this like
heavenly perfume called vanilla bean and
Noel from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works thank you

video thumbs up for morning routines and

apple pie pancake recipe if you guys
