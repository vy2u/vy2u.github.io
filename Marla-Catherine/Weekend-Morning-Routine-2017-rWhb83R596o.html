back into my channel today's video is
going to be a weekend edition morning
routine and my morning routines are
pretty relaxed on the weekends I
normally wake up went between nine and
ten around there and after I wake up I
go and I check my social media make sure
everything's still going good you know
like check my stuff and after I've done
that I'm going to go and get all bed and
stretch and just kind of I don't know I
like to walk around the house and then I
head to at the bathroom which you'll
brush up my hair freshen up and I don't
know about you guys but my face is
always like swollen when I wake up
especially when I sleep good that night
like my face is so like puffy so in
order to fix I like either splash it
with cold water or I wash my face so
today I washed my face and if I'm going
to be washing my face it's most likely
gonna be with you the Johnsons baby had
to show a face wash and I love this
stuff it's so sensitive on my skin it's
so gentle on my skin and I just I love
it
so after I wash my face I'm going to go
and brush my teeth because I mean I show
us an every morning routine or whatever
but you know I have to do it you're a
little shocked right now because Marla
working out what no I've been trying to
work out a little bit more and if I am
going to be working out it's going to be
on the weekends and I love to do good my
goodness this is so amazing I love to do
I love to do kickboxing but running on
the treadmill is great and I know I'm
not wearing shoes but I'm so sorry so
after I workout I'm going to go in
showers one of my followers introduces
to me at horse shampoo and it's
apparently supposed to make your hair
long so I've been using it in hopes that
it will do so after I take my shower I'm
going to go and make breakfast and this
is my favorite so to shake its almond
milk Hershey's cocoa powder some Adams
peanut butter or any peanut butter
really and then it's some stevia and
honey and I love this it fills me up and
it keeps me so full and it's healthy and
it's good and tastes good snack it's
just awesome and I love use honey to
sweeten it this is the use of the local
Utah honey so it tastes super sweet and
super good I also add a few ice cubes
just to make it a little bit cooler and
thicker and then I blend out on my magic
bullet
so I put in a blue straw and then I
drink it and it's good and that after I
do my breakfast to read where I take my
gummy vitamins and I honestly think
these W vitamins don't even help or make
me healthy but they just taste good so
then I go and I tell you in my room most
of the time I forget to clean my room or
I shove everything underneath my bed
don't tell my mama but then but for the
video I did try so I'm picking up and
I'm watering my plants and I'm making my
bed and I also haven't taken some you
guys tips from watering my plants and
it's been working so thank you guys did
you guys call them to that on the
weekends I like to experiment with my
makeup even though I probably get out
the most on the make weekends which is
not okay but anyway so I'm going to go
in with my new do to palette and I'm
just putting on some fun colors then I
put on fill in my eyebrows you know do
all the usual IVA everyday makeup
routine in it this is basically what it
is you guys can go check her out and
then when I messed up on my contouring I
can feel it you know I'm not really that
good at makeup I'm pretty basic at it
but this is what I do so so now this is
my outfit and hair my outfit is we're
going on a photo shoot and so it's a
little bit more weird and most of it is
thrifted and then my hair is this super
cool zigzag it braids that are super
tight and super retro so we forgot to
film an outro so I'm so sorry but thank
you guys for watching remember to
subscribe and give this video a thumbs

ideas that'd be so helpful and I'll see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
