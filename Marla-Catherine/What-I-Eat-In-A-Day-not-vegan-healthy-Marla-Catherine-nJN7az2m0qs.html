is gonna be a little bit more relaxed
and more personal I guess but today I
mean we feeling a ye in a day because
that's where it all the time and I'm
finally I'm into two guys I'm out of
breath from running up the stairs so
I've been feeling a little bit
underneath the weather lately I woke up
to it's snowing a lot and so I wanted
something warmer so I had oatmeal for
breakfast I normally eat oatmeal on the
weekends and on days where I wake up
feeling super cold it's literally
snowing so much I don't even know if
we're gonna be able to leave the house
because it's snowing so much it's
snowing oh why I'm really happy right
there there'd be a huge mountain but
it's so snowing stuff that you can't
even see it like it just is all white
anyway I'm gonna go ahead and make
myself some lunch cuz I'm starving
no I'm just hungry I like literally I've
never been wider well actually that's
why I normally like to take these here
it's gonna no gummy vitamins I tried
taking the regular who's gonna know
vitamins which are actually my camera is
sitting on those are the regular like
who's gonna know pills I'm using as a
tripod uh but I always forget to take
those because I don't like taking pills
I like eating going these they taste
like fruit snacks I don't know if they
really make a difference in here but
they taste good so
this is what you put in it to make it
look and tastes delish if you like I put
way too much on the really salty so now
this is cooked so what we like to use is
these tortillas that are like only 50
calories or normally like to eat things
like this on the weekends when I have
more time to prepare my meals so yes
your plus and it's gone so it's one
o'clock and that's when I ate my lunch I
ate breakfast at 10:00 and then one is
around what I made my lunch and now I'm
probably gonna go and eat a yogurt DS so
my favorite non-dairy was it called my
not favorite non-dairy yogurt is this
brand right here they taste really good
I'm gonna try this flavor right here
it's the peach one and it's not focusing
these right here also the best things
ever so in a day I try to drink water if
I'm completely honest with you guys I
drink way less water than I shouldn't
post I'm supposed to be doing like some
days I just forget to drink water which
is I know so bad I'm the type of person
that is more prone to drinking water if
it's in a bottle I don't know what my
issue is with that but I really like
bottled water and this is I found this
at Good Earth and I really really like
it's just the 1907 New Zealand waters
and it tastes really good so I'd highly
recommend it's like 60 cents so it is
about 2:30 ish and I'm gonna go ahead
and eat a snack and I like to eat
something quick and like on-the-go for
my snack normally and so today's video
is actually sponsored by our X bar which
I think it's super cool because I eat
these all the time and then I'm like
being sponsored by them which is like
cool - bar X bar see right here and if
they're the best things ever I really
love the Rx bars because they have
real ingredients in them and so they
taste natural and they taste really good
literally like they're so the greens are
so natural that everything inside of the
bar is right there in the front like
they're so good I really like them
they're also a gluten free soy free and
dairy free dairy free especially it's
important for me I really really like
these because they're just super
portable and I like to throw these in
for my school lunches after I get home
from school I like to eat these just if
I'm on the go and I want to put
something in my purse so these are X
bars I love them highly recommend them
and my favorite flavor is the peanut
butter one because I'm a sucker for
peanut butter peanut butter anything and
I will love it if you guys are
interested in purchasing these arcs bars
they sell them in stores plus online
it's so you can go to our X bar comm
slash Marla and you can enter in the
code Marla for 25% off your first order
so that makes it super nice and
affordable and yeah I'm gonna go ahead
and eat some it right now and I'll show
you guys like the packaging and stuff ok
so this is the rx bar they look they
look healthy you got to admit what
caught my attention with them when I
first saw many stores is how like simple
the packaging is okay so I'm eating
another one and this is the chocolate
coconut one and this one is super cute
like it has the little white chunks in
it just thought that was cute I also
like to eat this sometimes super good
just kidding
I just spent 70 bucks and a so non-dairy
products always kind of have like a
weird texture it's almost like a gelatin
but if you look past that these are
actually pretty good so I'm about to go
ahead and try it yeah it was really good
you're also and be like well what is
wrong
yeah I feel like so tired and I almost
go sleep while they're ordering food
guys anyway I know this is supposed to
be like a mochi what ie today buddy like
it's nobody today she's like I normally
don't eat out but today we are going
there's a family so yeah okay so I know
a girl's like I said and I got the
sticky fingers in the prize and it's
this stuff
not very healthy either but it is real
life people hey guys so it's currently
like almost 10 o'clock at night I'm now
ready for bed I'm wearing my new sweater
new crewneck sweater stuff from our pot
so literally like 13 bucks so it's like
yes thank you guys so much for watching
it my way in a day this video I was
looking back at some of the footage and
I realized that I literally I didn't eat
like any vegetables or anything and I
normally do but at the same time it was
it's okay anyway it's realistic and so I
hope you guys did enjoy it
also remember that I'm not a doctor or
physician or any of that type of fancy
stuff I think we should be focused not
on dieting but on having a healthy
lifestyle and drinking lots of water
