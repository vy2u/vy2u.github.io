going to be starting some well not
starting so I've already done a tactical
video but I mean we doing another back
in school video and please don't get mad
at me so today I would be doing a
back-to-school what is it in my backpack
I'm really excited to bring this video
to you guys
because not only is it like
back-to-school and love to queue
supplies but I'm going to give away
bernama totally stay tuned until the end
for giveaway rules and what would be
giving way to guys but please do not
fast forward the videos that is cheating
I after I've in my summer whole like
summer clothing haul what what backpack
machines I am doing using this backpack
for my back to school this is my
all-time favorite products like wood ten
out of ten recommend get yourself one if
you have it they are that so this is our
Christmas like a yellow ocher and it
they feel all been clocked in I love the
type of backpacks because they're
gigantic even though they look like
they're smoking outside that's good
that's a plus so starting off I have a
plan so I got this planner and I think
it is so cute it is it is I'm sure going
to try not to thank you I think planners
are so useful I'm going to happen to my
backpack - WD - just when I have a
homework assignment I'll be able to
quickly jot down and then look at it so
the next item inside my backpack is
deodorant please don't make fun of me
but most the time I forgot to put on
deodorant I run to the girls locker room
and then I pull out my deodorant out of
my backpack and then I put it on I
totally recommend doing that because you
know there's those days you just forget
and you don't want to be sneaky so the
next item inside the backpack
are these really adorable pencils I am
so excited ease so I think I the reason
why I'm so excited about these is first
off they're cute and second off I saw on
tumblr like it was a photo of pastel
color and then they have like little
motivational quotes on them which I
thought was so like that was a smart
idea because sometimes you need the
extra help when you take in the essay
and you know you're going to fill why
are these consoles that are looking at
me so the next item is in their backpack
are these fine line markers and I have
markers in my backpack because of the
next size I'm going to show you but I
love the fine tip markers so much
more than the big fat ones because the
fat ones like it's so hard to do
anything cuz they're so big so one of my
siblings has like a smaller version of
it I was sort of so cute and I saw at
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble's but then we went to
Target and they had a gigantic version
of it a sketchbook it's just a simple
sketch book but these are so nice to
have because when you just want to
doodle on the bus this is huge this is
this is kind of unnecessary but this is
huge and I love it just a bunch of blank
paper inside the next item in my
backpack
are these goodie Al Chile's murder bands
I cannot tell you how many times I had
my hair like in a braid last year and
then the rubber band snap in the middle
class and like my hair just like
untangles and it looks disgusting and
there was only times you know I wish I
just had two rubber band or something of
the sort so these are my favorite ones
because they're Caesars obsidian would
look like you remember branded the next
item inside my backpack is this
checklist and it kind of goes along it's
kind of like the planner but these are
just smaller and I can just keep these
like inside my locker so the next item
sorry my backpack are these paper clips
my brother kept on making fun of me
because you text Marla you know you can
get like a 5 in Chicago those select 50
steps at Walmart but no I had to be
extra so I got some real gold
they put just me during the school years
you'll be able to tell which paper clips
are yours mine is five of your school
supplies so sometimes at school being a
little dull the next item incident eyes
backpack is gum you know how to make
friends 101 Paul you go in the middle
spot this is like the gigantic pack is
the 35 sticks and my favorite flavor
from them in the spearmint
but also them I got two more packs and
these are little extra but you know
that's just what I am projects done in
gourmet gum and this is rainbow ice in
birthday cake kind of had I high
expectations for these and they kind of
taste as a chemical but you know they're
fun to like give to your friends when
you don't want to give them your knife
stuff so this is also and then if you
last was certainly not the least and
probably one of the most important items
you can have your backpack Carmex
I will never switch to any of those like
iOS stuff because this stuff is always
so good certainly $0.99
literally $0.99 and it's so moisturizing
and like it takes me like an entire year
to use of this little small bottle and
also
mentioned later so that wraps up my so
that wraps up my twas my bag at
2017-2018 back to school this a haul
