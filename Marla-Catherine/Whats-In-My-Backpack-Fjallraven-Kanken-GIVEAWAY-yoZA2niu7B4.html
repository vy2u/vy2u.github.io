never used anything any other brand of
backpacks since because I love this so
much I've given away quite a few of

classic size I bought this about a year
ago and it is holding up great like it

complaints about it I mean it's a little
dirty but that's just because I haven't
washed it or anything at first I didn't

like I don't I'm not putting that
anywhere like I'm not wearing a pickle
Rick pin yeah and so I was like I'm not
