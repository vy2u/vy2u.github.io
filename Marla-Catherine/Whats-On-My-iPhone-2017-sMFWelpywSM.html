my channel if you are new here you know
do subscribe so I look kind of weird
right now because I'm about to want to
go to Shu and so I have freckles and I
systems and turtlenecks
it's a today's video it's going to be a
what's on my eyes on eyes the eyes on
the 5s and this is it's a bone and it
works so you know don't need the latest
and greatest you know so without further
ado let's get into movie video to start
off my lock screen is a picture I like
via Goffe and mountain and it's one of
the Apple ones that like already there
as a default one anyway so when you open
up my phone and this is what the home
screen looks like I only have a one page
on my phone because I just like have
everything there so the first half of my
screen is just about all the basic
required apps on the phone and it start
off in the top left hand corner is a
messages and calendar photos camera then
on the next row below is whether clock
maps and notes and stuff and the next
row is a reminder is iTunes Store after
space times in a row after that is a
calculator mail assigned and then we hit
my favorite folder so inside the
favorites folder is just one page
starting at the top left hand corner is
Spotify and Spotify is probably my
favorite app of all time
I love to listen to music on there and I
think we should such an awesome app so
follow me @ underscore Amana Katherine
and I have a new post every month I try
to find new and exciting songs people
follow me on there so the next up is
Instagram and Instagram is a must you
know go follow me on instruments at
Mauna Katherine and just as soon as my
YouTube username so this is my Instagram
app and this in my town I tried out
relatable captions and I closed as much
as I can you know without overwhelming
you guys so I get what supposed to me so
if you guys want to go see more warming
go follow me at Monica
so after interim it is Twitter and I'm
kind of new to Twitter
kind of not you know like I thought like
a few months ago so Twitter has been a
very go to a pletely I love to
post census and so we got like it's at
marlott how they're an underscore and
you guys get a little confused as all
this all the links will be done in the
description box as they always are in
every video the next row beneath is
starts with snapchat and snapshot I've
been using so much more lately I think
I've been using all my apps a little bit
more than usual so I've been trying to
get a graph so I'm on snap right now and

really use this out too much but it is
always good to have on hand then at the
next up falling that is a disco or this

it's always great for editing that
photos really quickly and looking like

thank you guys and made sure to keep on
food for men following the next row of
apps searches the games at I learn three
games and these are the three skin don't
tempt me
don't darkness okay so the next app
folder or whatever guys I call it on the
last row is games and inside a games

religiously probably my favorite is
still fine anyway so starting off a
sketch is pro and I love to just draw on
here and duel especially during church I

colouring book then you know plot
sketches get to do a liable so yeah like

highway I would open this app up and
show you guys it but my like computer's
freaking out and not letting me solely
following up after he'll find is
Minecraft Pocket Edition and you know
got to get that in their daily daily
dose of building so those are only three
games I have and after that folder is
random and a lot of these are just the
apps I never use like never okay I do
use Amazon sometimes but not too much
you know that it defined iPhone remote
and IMDB and the next page after that is
watch the seven-minute workout which it
probably should use more but you know
and then the last one is the Yamaha
controllers we have this speaker and you
can like bluetooth it and it's the last
but certainly not least apps are on the
bottom like names like that little strip
of grey like that you know the main apps
anyway well so the first up on there is
LDS a gospel library and this is just my
scriptures on my app on my phone it's
really cool because these are just easy
to pull whenever oh my god is phone and

many but the ones I do have I I'm always
using them thank you guys so much for

my phone case looks like is pink and I
love this phone case because it isn't
split and it isn't sponsored but it's
