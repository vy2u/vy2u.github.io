Carville on the beach hey guys it's
Marla and we're back with another video
pop it out - holiday videos cuz it it's
like the holiday season and if this is
the first time years in my face and you
should subscribe and I'll put it just
like just like hit it's like this video
is my Christmas break edition morning
routine and without making this intro
too long let's get into you so to start
off my morning routine I obviously have
to wake up and I don't know about you
this is like my least favorite word of
the day so I shut off my alarm and I
have to check all my statuses like
Instagram and snapchat and Twitter you
know the huge go follow me by the way
links down below and I obviously have to
stretch and I have to just get my
Jitterbugs mommy fix a day so then I
plug in my Christmas lights and my
favorite part of the holidays is
decorating and listening to Christmas
music so also if you guys did not know I
do play the piano and I've been playing
since I was six so yeah a fun fact of
the day and after my little jam session
I have to go and brush my teeth because
if I don't I'll literally like taste is
multi old tasting ball in my mouth and
also to kill two birds with one stone
just give yourself a little pep talk
so I normally take a bath or a shower
and today I took a bath and to make
everything just that more festive I took
a lush bath bomb and this is a holiday
one and it looks green but it fizzes
into this really really pretty wine red
color and I this was my first bath bomb
and it was a 10 out of 10 experience so
awesome so relaxing and it smells so
good it's the most beautiful salad II
never gone out of the shower I'm gonna
move on to my makeup and I know I've
already changed around my room so expect
an updated room tour elbow I don't know
miss I really really love to listen to
Christmas music while doing my makeup
and today's makeup look was a little bit
more high coverage and also I did a more
festive eye shadow color it was like
this really pretty
now I head into the kitchen and I'm
gonna make my holiday edition pancakes
and these are just literally random like
a random recipe I found on the internet
for pancakes dreaming of a white
Christmas and then I divided the mixture
into two bowls and from there I took the
food coloring and the colors red and
green and made them super pigmented and
supersaturated sleighbells and I know
this is so unhealthy but this is so cool
for the holidays these pancakes turned
out a lot better than I thought they
were going to and so it made me consider
working out I hope oh whoa seriously
those Easter notes so good and after
they cooled down a little I put on the
whipped cream and I stack my pancakes
and I literally pile on the whipped
cream so high and then no this is not
taco seasoning these are green sprinkles
and let's go add to the sugar I just put
on a buttload of maple syrup these were
the best-tasting pancakes that I've ever
made and ever tasted normally when I
make pancakes they taste like eggs and
or I just end up burning them
my holiday outfit was more photo shoot
geared toward if that makes sense and my
and I curled my hair PS you know okay so
we're now at Starbucks and we just
ordered that white peppermint chocolate
okay so we just got it to the river the
Christmas one is and then I has no
coffee smells good
oh my goodness we're hooked me look it's
very peppermint tea I like peppermint so
this is very holidays I like it was
pretty I too photo shoots today one of
this really really cute Christmas tree
farm and then the other at my aunt's
house with my cousin's dog if that makes
sense
