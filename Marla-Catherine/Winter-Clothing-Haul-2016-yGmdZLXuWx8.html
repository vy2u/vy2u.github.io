actually from a their store so this is
like a it's like a maroon plum sweater
and it's is there stain on that now I
have a few things from forever21 it's
plain white and it's kind of flowy has
like like it's almost like a boxy type
style scroll comment like repeat and I
just like I was like so true for
Instagram because you know you scroll up
cover you like and next up from forever
21 was the same effects well sure except
different color and differencing and
it's mint green and colors and it says
not today
sorry by next year from forever 21 this
was like a steal guys oh by the way that
other shirt was only eight bucks cute so
next up from forever 21 was this really
like really long you know he's done it
it's a maxi dress and it is a little
like form-fitting like um I actually did
want to get the army green color but um
it like kind of outline like your
underwear and stuff like that and I
didn't like that but the block didn't do
that and so let's pick out black this is
actually lasting from forevertron
but it's these shoes and I just thought
they are so cute they were let's see if
you hear 10 bucks and they're actually
in my last vlog if you guys are watching
them if you guys watch if you guys want
to go check out their channel that's
actually called Studio C and they're
like it's like a clean humorous channel
it's just somebody but there's a video
and the girl like says oh yeah every
time
the couple is about to kiss like she
drive-by I know it's hilarious guys go
check out their show but my grandma
actually caught this for me
way to go being hip grandma but this
shirt actually says oh yeah and she
didn't even know what said when she
bought it she just thought it was a cute
color but uh so funny yeah oh yeah I got
this shirt and it's black
you're so told scenery of New York City
remember says 80 or oh no necks in front
of us so my mom actually got these four
mean they're only three bucks apiece
it's this one just says arrow 87 and a
few I don't know if you guys didn't see
it on film but on the arrow party also
click it's like snow and then the next
shirt we mean meiosis your watch like 20
hashtag 20 Tuesday you know it's not
hashtag 20 Tuesday because it's not
Tuesday it's actually Friday so it just
says Aeropostale new york 87 and pink
now next up is actually I'm so excited
about this one it's a company reached
out to me I'm called cutie and they're
like amazing I actually designed this
shirt and it says will work for clothes
and it's like super long I didn't expect
it to be this one that so this was
actually the shirt outlined was will
work for clothes and then you gotta go
in and customize the colors of the words
and I thought that's so cool or like
they even have converse that you can go
to mine so I'd love a pair of those
because they're like ice cream ones and
marble ones you gonna choose out the
colors I just think that's so cool and
the package eva is also super cute when
it came in the mail it was like just in
a white light package but when you
opened up this I felt it was like in
tissue paper and they had like always
like it was just so cute so if you guys
want to go check them out I want you to
be doing a photo shoot and this year if
you guys wanna go follow your and
Instagram another self promo at Marla
Kathryn last but certainly not the least
I think they're so cute and they are a
little too big on me so I gotta wear my
super fluffy socks with them but you
guys have actually seen these even a
photo shoot I got these holy month ago
that's I know it's a wild life but I'm
only warning like three times but they
are these like um I think they're called
like hiking boots or do you guys like
you're clearly recognize this style
I've seen this style it going around
everywhere I thought they were so cute
but I was like I don't know if I want to
get pair of brown ones but
and also they're like 60 bucks and so I
was like no I went on to this company
it's called go Jane calm and they I was
looking on their website and they had
these and they have them in the regular
like brown color but they also had a
pink and I was like I'll get it in pink
