video I am almost barefaced I do have
eyelash extensions why it's because I'm
doing an hour routine and I was like I
have to film intro for this after I took
off my makeup and so anyway but today or
before night routine because so many of
you guys were requesting this and also
I'm going to be sharing some of my new a
favorite skincare products from about
clarity so I think this is so let's just
get right on into this video my night
routine normally starts off when I start
to do my homework and I will just write
songs and kind of just multitask by
doing that and I normally like you like
listen to me some music while I'm doing
it just kind of very relaxed and then
after that I go and do snack time /
dinnertime so now I'm gonna be doing my
skincare routine I've been using a bio
clarity for my skincare routine lately
and I love their products because they
all contain a floral floral X basically
just helps you to like reduce your pore
size your oiliness your redness and it
helps prevent like future breakouts I
really love bio clarity because my skin
has been clearing up so much more than
it has been lately
I also feel good because I'm using
natural ingredients on my face
step number two is treat and a treat is
super good because it contains salicylic
acid which basically helps prevent your
breakouts and diminish them step number
three is called restore and restore is
actually a super pigment to the green
and that's because that's chlorophyll
and it helps to calm exfoliate and clear
your skin with all like the drying and
the redness Hydra is another one of my
favorites because it's basically
smoothly for your skin like it's super
nourishing and super moisturizing plus
it has Argan and olive oil in it which
is super good for your skin bottom line
bio clarity is all about using natural
ingredients for your face and I really
love these products they have helped me
out so much so I totally recommend them
to you guys so after I've done my
skincare it's basically bedtime and I'm
literally so weird like what's my
problem
anyway so I changed my pajamas and I
know I'm wearing a different pajamas in
this clip is because I had a refilm and
I forgot what pajamas I was wearing so
I'm so sorry but you get the idea so on
a school night like to be in bed by 9:30
10:00 at the latest but if I get into
bed a little bit earlier like around
9:00 I like to just do some indexing and
this is me pretending to be doing and
Xing but just imagine me doing it and
then I like to also write a few songs to
my journal just to get like the creative
juices flowing you know and then just go
my phone maybe read some scriptures you
know dude do my daily just like routine
stuff after that I'm pretty tired and by
the way I did brush my teeth I just
didn't show it after that I just
literally go to bed anyway thank you
guys so much for watching if you enjoyed
it give it a thumbs up by the way I had
a few comments on my last video where I
was like smash the subscribe button
I mean I thought that was serious and
they're like wow you keep from begging
for subscribers no it was a joke so I
smash the subscribe button give it a
thumbs up I also did get a new
microphone and so I hope that little
creaking sound on the lens is a little
bit more muted and maybe the audio is
better hopefully anyway so thanks guys
