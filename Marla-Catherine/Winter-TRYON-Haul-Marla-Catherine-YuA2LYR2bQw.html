it's Marla hey guys so today I'm gonna
be filming
hey guys it is Marla and today we're
gonna be putting a winter clothing call
because I have stuff to haul and you
guys been asking for this you know why
not so that's about it so let's just get
right on into this first letter is from
brandy melville and I've been wanting
this sweater for so long I saw it on
there it's comfy it was like that I so
cute then so McKean actually like
summers she started wearing that she
wore it it looks like it's so cute so I
end up getting it at I really like it no
regrets it's super comfy and I like the
way it fits the next item is this I
don't know if it this isn't a
windbreaker but it kinda like has that
style it's like super soft though it's
so soft but it's a super pretty dark
green that I actually own another
sweater in this color and I really like
this color on me so really good like
go-to and then I also got I also got I
was very extras day and I got a matching
pair of sweats so it's kind of like a
Juicy Couture track see anyway this is
like so funny to me because I think
track suits are like the funny singer
ever like if you're just like not
feeling it one day I'm just gonna wear a
tracksuit I'm just gonna do that this
sweatshirt I've been wanting for quite a
while and it's the same style as this
green one except it's different colors
colors it looks like this it has the
white stripe all across got the murca
flag could support Marco it says Los
Angeles across it and I think I was
really cute because I do like LA so this
next clothing item is there's a gray
very relaxed sitting like it's not a
flannel is this a flannel I don't know
it's very very comfy and I think this
would be so cute features like went
camping and or this and super relaxed
and I really love the way that this fits
this item is also from any level what a
shocker
this long-sleeve yellow and I really
like stripes are you just something I
like stripes got this it's a striped
very relaxing long-sleeve shirt and this
is so pretty and it tapers off at the
sleeves very flowy and very relaxed so
these are super cute they're they kind
of fit like leggings there
like parent material but these are black
red and like can color plaid and I think
these are perfect first off for the
holiday season but second off do you
guys know for the movie Freaky Friday is
with Lindsay Lohan like I feel like her
character would wear these babies my
door you give me that door door or I
will kill myself
so this sweater is fits the same ways
this one and I really love the way that
they spit but it blue it's it's Navy
it's red and it's white strike I really
love the style these sweaters I think
they are just so cute and perfect for
the winter so these next fans I've been
wanting for quite a while too and I
finally bought them but they are why is
it like hackers know what is it called
khaki no it's not khaki Oh quarterly
corner right I love the way that these
fit I love the color I love this like
the material of them and I think they
are definitely staple item because they
mattress so many things so this next
sweater is once again the same style is
that dark green one and the like USA one
but I really love the color of this it's
reminded me of like a Cinderella color
and I think it's very pretty I cannot
stress you guys how soft these are like
I'm almost I got afraid to wear to
school cuz I know I will fall asleep
during first period which is math that's
not a good period to fall asleep when
checking the last item on brandy is this
white t-shirt and I got this for when I
was in LA and need to go to the Sephora
vent and I need a white t-shirt and so I
just caught this the last time from
ready Mobile is this black belt I've
been eating a black belt for the longest
time I was like this is only 10 bucks
and you're gonna get it it took me
forever I had to have that one of those
boys explain to me how this belt works
because there's a little confusing for
me from garage I got this white and
black stripe this is called a
long-sleeve shirt and this one is very
nice and very comfortable and then this
jacket is gonna keep me warm this is the
this was a huge jacket but it's a very
nice large winter jacket that I needed
because I grew out of my
if you like it's a neutral color so
we'll match with lots of stuff then at
my next item is I'm super insight
I love Birkenstocks so much I want every
single pair now I got myself I splurged
and bought myself a pair of white
Birkenstock these are so nice I wore
them every single day in LA my feet
never hurt they matched everything and
they're so cute they may or may not look
like something that one of the
characters in Hercules would wear but I
am not complaining I really like these
and then the next round of shoes I got
and the last pair are these converse
they're just basic white converse I have
been needing a pair of these because I
should tell my sister's everyday no joke
and so I was like I can't I just have to
get ready so I did and I'm really black
so I'm gonna be wearing them everywhere
I forgot to show you guys these brainy
items there's two more I got this
t-shirts because I'm actually going to
San Francisco in February I think and so
I was like oh it's just a San Francisco
shirt and I think the logo on this is so
cute with the stripes I got a pair of
black I love love love the style of the
jeans by or like the pants vibrating
Lobo they're like stretching at the
waist and they like cut off like them in
half and I really like the way that they
fit on me I got a pair of these pants in
black because I don't really have a good
pair of like solid black jeans I can
wear but now that you I'll be wearing
these probably almost every single day
then the last items I got is this I got
this actually quite a while ago and then
there's a girl my school at started
wearing it I was like dang it because
now we were on the same day and that's
gonna be embarrassing but ok and then I
got this black and white striped sweater
and I what sold me on it is what's it
called the shoulders it's like flares
out and I think that this is so cute and
then this next one I got is this
obviously love stripes I don't know what
it is about them but I really like them
so that's why I got that last but
certainly not the least not a clothing
item but I just want to show it to you
guys I haven't owned a record player but
I still got this anyway I got her album
and I don't even own a record player but
I got because it was on sale offer I may
or may have not bought in my brother a
record for Christmas I hope he's really
not watching
probably isn't because he never even
watched my videos anyway because he's
such a hater but it's okay love you Sam
I bought him the record and then it was
buy one get one half off so I got this
record for the legit like 10 bucks so
it's like I don't even own a record
player but if I do get one one day this
will be great that wraps up today's haul
