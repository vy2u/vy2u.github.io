my channel today's video is going to be
a Q&amp;amp;A I asked you guys quite a while ago
to ask you questions on my into your
post and I'm now just getting around to
like doing it so yeah sorry about that
but yeah could be the video today so
look into it so I have walked into
things and my favorite show the hands
down like that I I want to entertain it
in one day which I would calculate it
was at 12 hours like where did I get 12
hours to sit down and watch the show
like where I am on online caller I am a
little afraid that the season 2 is not
going to be a good season one I really
hope it topped it but I'm so excited at
Halloween probably I would go to trick
or treating publishers going to watch it
the whole time so yeah I love good
things and I probably should buy some
like a poster merchandise I don't
because I I should get a poster saying
it right above my bed cuz I had alcohol
if I'm going to be doing a meet-up and I
love to I don't love to do you coming up
but I don't know how like to set that up
or our hiney people would actually show
up and if anyone would even show up you
know what I mean so just as excited as
you guys are I am extremely excited for
when I get my braces off I think reaches
are annoying and they're ugly and they
ruin my chances of ever dating the kids
that I have a crush on I have an idea
when I have a result but nothing's for
sure because it's still like another
year way but I'm thinking around March
this time or I can even get some awesome
December I asked all the time what kind
of ideas and it's the Canon EOS 70d and
I also asked all the time what is that
annoying crazy sound in the backyard of
it and since the Canon 7d is autofocus
it has to like crank it to focus so it
like goes like like anyway so that's it
all focusing when you hear that so it's
not some weird like chinchilla
Mariana okay
do you want to be an actual model later
on in their life
yeah only I would love to be model but
as far as being all right now I got to
work on this kind of 100 core Curtis so
I also watch the series of unfortunate
events all one day of Simone two days it
was yes two days I mean today I thought
it was awesome and the girl was so
pretty I absolutely described me to cut
my bangs again that's why I did it
because I thought she looks so pretty
with them I'm like I know I can do that
and then I couldn't do it so now I'm
like living with a bit regret like what
is this all Michael so every time I
think about like public school or
Allegiance I decided to go to high
school I consider high school a boy can
really tried to go there so I would have
to say on my school for me for anyone
else it's different for everyone who's
ever in a different opinion soak my
favorite YouTube oh my favorite
youtubers ah he is coming Gracie's the
bomb diggity do I have any other two
links yes I did so yeah I have a 5 -
well 35 out of the cool bonus is a week
amounts um no there's a total of 5 in my
family and I'm the fourth child before
the second to get with young list yeah
we're pretty cool oh how do I deal with
them I push them in the face so fake
friends are really annoying because role
annoying I normally never deals I never
dealt with fake friends really before I
started YouTube if you like have been
only dealing with a friend recently
basically with the fake friends be nice
to them but don't go out of your way to
like please them
in seventh grade as kind of time our
teachers would be like searches today on
YouTube and I'm like for the class to
watch you to build my video or whatever
and then a lot of the time this like one
time I remember this one time this girl
like started out Tuesday oh yeah Maya
had the channel it called Marley
Catherine a ghost and she's up on
YouTube and it was what I wanted like a
thousand subscribers and I felt like
crying gonzo is there because I Navajo
class knew and then also the teacher is
like oh I'm not going to do that not as
I go to the store now you had to know
why I don't do story trying videos
because nothing happens so a lot of I
got all my edit my photos and you have a
how I edit my Instagram photos on
YouTube and kind of a more of a joke
video later it's useful and pollution
