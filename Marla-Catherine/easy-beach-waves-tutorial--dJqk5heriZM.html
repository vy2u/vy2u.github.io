such a horse into many moral so i get
asked a lot how i pull my hair and now
i'm not buying my brother's fresh
curtains so let's just get started so
start off i have clean hair it's brushed
in all good and then i have a baby this
is like a win it I'm pretty sure this is
a 1 inch it curling wand is actually
used to be a barrel but I unscrew to be
a barrel clamp and then a straight one
so you know a little white mark for you
so I just go in and I section off the
first layer start at the bottom and I'd
like to start not like to cinema
sections but like like not to fix
started section it off and then extra
curling it and PS the lighting change
because I thought that one of my box
bags wasn't even on there's people who
train yard this graphics section and
then I curl away from my face
so courts that way place it behind my
here and then I wrap it around and then
I kind of like to wait a little bit a
section off and then you for like 5
seconds 5 4 3 2 1
leave it and then it could it look more
natural and I actually hold the hair
like 2 seconds and then drop it relaxes
the curl
that's basically what all curls looks
like and then I'm just going to go do
that to everything will section down my
hair so it couldn't email click I'm
sorry I drew Ender's office to Nova beer
wine i rice water mixes trying to
overheat I got my Twitter for a dollar
ninety seven and then there was a $10
off coupon so regardless for free that'd
be you incur Oh so yeah now I'm going on
the other side and I'm coming away from
I face always go away for my crank back
and curl with my hair and then I just
split down there those curls and then I
let the nurse my hair and I should Tina
off again okay guys it so I'm on my lair
and the bangs look like ass crowd so
that's okay so I just normally let it go
to like for my national program and the
bangs are really hard so I don't
normally do them so I try to make sure
like all the straight hairs not have a
rock because then it will be hard to
curl but essentially it's a good
and I like to start in the back whenever
I'm on the left leg and curling away
Frank they leave it on his face seconds

head I got 14 languages actually being
here because when you better going on
