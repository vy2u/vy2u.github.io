puffed up she's got her eyes fixed on
floor hey guys it's Marla and thanks for
the grounds video so today zo is going
to be all about how to display the
Instagram game how to take good photos
how to pose in subtle just like a few
tips that helped me in that I'm also
doing the dishes sorry
so I'm just gonna be so many guys like
tips that helped me and that I've seen
that like work so you know I just got
started so the first tip is to look in
the mirror I don't sound like really
like weird but look in the mirror and it
kind of post and pretend that you're
remodeling because then you can figure
out that like what works for you and
what you look good so like for me I
don't all good like this so I'm gonna
close like this I learned that in the
mirror basically just trying to go to
look so mine is racing my eyebrow my
collar is desirable raise my eyebrow and
like doing like a not a pal but like a
kind of I can cover my braces
so yeah that's what works for me and I
figured that out by looking the mirror
imposing the next tip is to save photos
that you like on Instagram so I used to
think the save feature on Instagram is
kind of weird like I was like I'm you're
just gonna show it but then I realize
that it's like also save space in your
camera roll but it's super easy used to
double if a button on the Instagram
anytime you see a pose that you think is
cool and outfit that you like hair
makeup that you like because when you
need inspiration you can just scroll
through your state photos and see what
you've received I do this all the time
and this is what I do when I'm eating
inspiration and it helps so much you can
even save some online so the next thing
is to put the upper into your hair and
makeup I promise it will look good in
the long run I personally in person the
words like about this much makeup and on
a daily basis but in photos I wearing
guyliner do my eyebrows over mascara I
do wear foundation wear all this stuff
and so on like you look at you shake
loose but then when you go check this a
photo on camera it looks very natural
one doesn't look like you're wearing a
ton of makeup so I think that you guys
it should take the time to actually here
makeup and apply a little bit extra if
you don't want to make up and you're
just not about that then
we skip this step but if you do wearing
makeup apply a little bit extra because
a little extra goes a long way on
especially in front of the camera that
camera can make you look very washed out
into Lapine a little bit more makeup
help attempt and also invest in your
hair like either not not desperate like
take the time to do your hair because
every time I'm like oh my hair is flying
I'll just make gold we find it but the
photos always turn on girls like these I
station it look bad but like my hair
looks so atrocious I really think you
guys should just take the extra like 10
minutes to do a really pretty braid our
hair or to straighten it or to curl it I
already do it I don't ever regret it so
the next tip is for inside if you're
taking photos to face the window so if
the window my hand is the window and I'm
me I want to be facing the window so
that way that natural light is coming
onto my face and that's the best way to
get natural lighting in your photos and
the best lighting possible so if you
guys are outside are suggested taking
photos in the shade or if there is no
shade around you then I just take photos
so your back facing the Sun that way you
get a backlight and I go pretty you it
gold an hour types looks that works well
for me I saw this from another youtuber
so but this is not my thing I do not
come up with this so basically if you
are shooting a district sunlight and you
have to like kind of look towards the
Sun or you like looking up then it close
your eyes for like five seconds and look
at this on so like this so I pretend my
hands of Sun and then when you open up
your eyes your eye should be pretty much
adjusted a little bit more always not as
painful when you're like opening over
eyes because I know that whenever really
do that like my eyes layer chart to cry
because it's so like my eyes water so
much because it's been so bright but
that just helps your eyes adjustment so
if you guys do not want to go outside
and you want more of an indoor studio
look but you don't want to go to the
studio you can create your own very
easily by going to the dollar store and
picking out some wallpaper that they
have so we used to do this all the time
sorry I said wallpaper binding wrapping
paper like for presents - can buy like a
bright pink one of wrapping paper and a
cup a little bit tape onto the wall and
then you can just take pictures and it
looks like you have like you're in a
pink wall studio which is so cool insert
some photos of when I've done it I
design yellow one a blue one P one and
they're all from
for stuff like that all three bucks bet
if you are going to be shooting outside
I would suggest when you're not going on
the photo shoot to just always be
location scouting and this is where you
either drive before the photo shoot or
you just dedicate a day to driving
around your city driving around nearby
cities to find pretty location to shoot
at so if you're old enough to drive in
our teachers and driving around your
city or driving around local cities or
nearby cities to find the pretty places
that way when you do want to do a photo
shoot you already have all these
locations in mind and if you are not
able to drive then just walking around
your neighborhood you never know which
neighbor has a very cute Bush plan from
their house full flowers you can just go
stand in it that's cute so cute
so yeah just go location scouting a
super awesome and it's also super fun if
you like cheesy burns with you to go
talk just walk around exercise fun
sniffs and locations okay that's my
inventory so I'm proposing I don't have
many tips I'll give you guys some right
now but like its positioning your body
weight onto your back leg and give you
length in your body but all we've thrown
