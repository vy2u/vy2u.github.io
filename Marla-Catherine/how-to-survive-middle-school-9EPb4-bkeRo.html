today's video is going to be medical
advice and I brought in a professional
I'm a mechanical meanwhile I went to the
same school before she went on morning
so since I went off the grid so he has a
channel and it's super awesome so I'm
going to be linking that down below go
check them out if you want more pens so
I asked you guys on snapchat and
Instagram mostly snapchat though Jasmeet
questions and I will get ideas to give
you anything on so we're screwed opener
let's start this a little bit yeah it
just will slip 7th 8th grade or so date
tonight
it is 7th 8th and 9th house they focus
in junior high ok so what I do is I have
to make it interesting because like in
English I'll sit then I'm like why am I
here this is so basic guys so usually I
have to when he's talked about like
English terms I have to put it in terms
that make sense to me and that makes me
wanna have fun so send that like dancing
I always have to put into dancing term
how to spot out fake friends oh are you
a friend me well I got a call I know a
genuine friend um okay hey guys I
actually have had quite you and I feel
like I'm pretty throw it on him ow I
want to say I heard some people say that
Derrick ray trying to say only let's
check up like every once in awhile but
sometimes people just get busy not are
not really interested in you they're
just more like want to be your friend
it's like a tunnel or they need a school
I feel like you know when a friend is
using you is when they're just asking
you to do some for them or they're just
like repetitive doing the same thing
over they're not trying to learn more
about you or to get to know you more
yeah thank you guys you go make sure you
click like you click together but not
like the others
warriors put together by efficiency I'll
make sure you actually get a lot and
muscle I mean all of our next year my
took a lot of people I feel like ji-hye
is like the prime for bullies because
most of them are just they don't know
what they're saying else time there's
plenty people a lot sitting here I'm
different on believe job on hold
interest yeah I think this kid I'm
talking to this girl I should my but one
of my best friends and he likes show me
get the wall cuz I was talking about
your like visible yeah but a christening
wasn't I was excreted who's a fourth
grader so yeah I never really he was
just jealous because of me and my friend
was so close he was awesome yeah I was
there iris on the thicker side in all
through elementary school and I ran out
called fat and I'm so offended and then
like I end up getting over it but
basically you don't know the personal I
don't you got hope that God excuse me
girl you guys Marla it's so pretty like
like look at her she's so great I let me
go after the people like they truly
don't know you they just try to get
under your skin of her you just think of
this they don't know what they don't
know what's going on and you have to
ignore because you're better than what
they say you're ten times a million
times better than what they say you're
good so you're probably going to be look
at school kids are some people could eat
me to make me gag in junior high if
you're in a new kid so junior high
everyone's new the first year everyone's
near like because they combine all the
schools at Joe junior high so that's
kind of wasted into elementary friends
but in seventh grade I met more you said
to be outgoing like it's not going to
hurt to go to make friends right now I
try to like be friends or something
other kids and I'll go out and try but
anything to client's and go find other
people because there are other people
that do want to be your friend and I
want to be with you do you have a place
in the school no okay so the question
was do I have a boyfriend no and I don't
will never have one I'm 16 even then you
know I think relationships in middle
school are so lame because it's like
first off is not gonna last honey sorry
all right
it's not going to it's true though
second off white people's your so many
problems in German right on top that I
haven't put a Luxor in them
oh well independent drive-in yeah yeah
yeah but what do you do now
and then also immature boys a man can
you please give us some wise insight of
bubbles yeah like why are they so
matures hopefully boys are immature and
stupid and they do things Wyatt Wyatt
avoid stupid things they like you or
they're just a trashy person you can't
rock oh girl you guys don't have it
get out ya know for those are some boys
I do not do they like you but then
there's some ones that do it because
they just mean and they just wanna be
rude I'm immature boys boys it is part
of life and so just either avoid that or
just what we're going to shave not it
imma die
well most boys should just like if
you're gonna can be nice then they
should just be nice back but but not
then I guess I'd drop them how can I
better not to create myself should
actually do homework as I said very
difficult to sit down and just start to
think it's oh so dat video I hate Omer
24/7 but this do I do if it's math give
me some headphones so if you tell me of
edge and I like dance on dunno but if
it's like reading I have to motivate
myself I should feel my confidence so
what I tell myself is if I me the
chapter I have to read then I can watch
TV and the sons don't know I told it
after got total practic it's also like
like if you reach a certain goal when
you reward your sewing so like if you
how about you if you have like five
pages in math homework which is actually
a lot my doin page and then reward
yourself with
don't reward yourself with lego movie or
the TV soaps that's a long time so maybe
reward yourself with like five minutes
relaxing you know something like that
