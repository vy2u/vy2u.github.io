this one he just saw all the time of
services of my and when I look beautiful
when I have no time to raise me and yes
the tile is inspired by the antara cell
q so this is what are you doing so I'm
going to take tomorrow but as soon as
we've sprayed out all over my face
and that's or what you always have to
fill up so this makes your makeup last
longer a great way to combine your
concealer with the foundation and wine
is to skip a step and just using the
like a really high coverage foundation
down to your color and then you can use
that as a concealer so you can up above
a high coverage foundation will make you
so you can like skip that concealer
stuff so that's all quicker so you know
I'm just using the Born This Way
Foundation in the shade ivory says I'm
so light so pale um I really hope to not
be the color ivory by the time summer
comes Remagen and if you're literally
like school starts at eight and yoke of
the 758 then you can just turn your
pickles in the moles with like us just
use the eyeliner a brown eyeliner and
make it a move normally would lose their
all the next step to making it look like
a heck a lot of makeup when in reality
you are is playard
a little bit of blush and highlighter so
I'm applying my favorite blush which is
sadness it's dandelion
now it's going to fate this you guys are
asking what the name of this is it's
called champagne this is by Maybelline
and it's an eye Cheryl and I got it back
in like 2007 so a result of it but it's
my most favorite highlighter and it was
literally two dollars so I just good
real question highlighter and
highlighters makes it looks like you
tried and I'm going to
ten seconds yeah that's why I stand out
on it my cheekbone the ones that I don't
have if you think you look quite a while
to do your brows and you don't just get
them completely just put on a gel
mascara and this is been make me brow
and it's tinted brown so yeah this is
awesome is my favorite one it's two
bucks and the dupe for the whole benefit
brow islem just 22 bucks and this is the
same thing non-balanced my brows like
literally took 10 seconds so another
thing to make it look like you spent a
lot on your makeup but you're in rush is
lying like a little bit darker or more
brighter tone of eyeshadows husband it
looks like wow Shay's all tone up I'm
missing an eyeshadow brush and I'm just
going to take a little bit of this a
little bit along way and the niacin
apply this I shall it by the balm it's
called Mac Kumar
so now I'm never taught it was super
quick fully 20 seconds top and isn't it
going on some mascara and I'm doing wat
mascara and I used one in every video
it's a kitty cat eye waterproof mascara
April to September or major is making
every time of year after that I was just
like cold so honestly focus on the root
of my eyelashes make them look fuller
and also makes it look like you're
wearing some eyeliner gonna take a brush
hey Bobbi brush and a little bit of
little bronzer they benefit everyone has
it because it's so good
if you can't really doing her makeup
it's literally just like doing fast
motions secret lot so now I can finish
everything off using a little bit a lip
gloss and this is about sixty by petrol
Trixie they sent me some lip products
and I really will love this this is in
the shade sheer Rose not only the
liftoff is also a klumberg
so it makes your lips Teasley
so yeah that's the really fast makeup
look in for hair if you slept with your
hair had to point out literally to just
rock this ponytail like the mystery
tailor or I have some hair style videos
that this can go wash your pretty quick
so then for outfit throwing on a big
oversized sweater is so cute but it's
also super easy and some skinny jeans
and basically my I love you but I have
no time that get right into me so yeah
