I know I'm a very aware that all the
same but you guys should all always
request them so I'm just trying to
please you guys
however Marla works out once and it
killed her it's not if you're taking too
long I'm just gonna do this today anyway
I do most amazing tutorials are pretty
similar but basically I just switch up
the products and show you guys about my
new favorite products are some has been
working for me so I'm gonna start off
with like a normally everyone uses a
Mario Badescu but I'm trying to be
unique the way stuff isn't working super
well for me it's the Dermalogica bear
start all over toner but this makes me
feel in the stall chip so I have an aunt
that like uses essential oils and when I
read over to their house is like smell
like essential oils so when I was like 9
and so it just smells like essential
oils I mean I get smells good but it
makes me think of when I was nine so I
also like using it my skin can't really
prove that right now because I like
picked at it last night but normally
when I don't this like I so most days I
just skip concealer all together but I'm
importing a little bit today exceeding
the CC cream by it cosmetics and I just
use that as concealer it's not as thick
this kind of gets rid of the redness and
on the evenness you guys always say you
do this in a makeup tutorial every day
in it every day every single time and it
is true but it's because first off I'm
not like a makeup like I have a teacher
I'm not like you know like the makeup
you know I'm not any Rachael cut to like
I just can't do that basically I do
these makeup tutorials because I like to
show you the new product so I'm doing
not necessarily like how it would be
when they go up it's just running look
these are our products and I'm really
putting it on my face you know if you
guys are they any good song suggestions
that would be highly appreciated because
I don't my Spotify like discover
weeklies would not be good
like come on Spotify like I pay premium
for music so after I normally do my face
makeup I go ahead and I put what I have
not sure is my lips because my lipstick
it's so trapped like they will bleed in
the middle class and I'm like no
chapstick so I've been using the candy
cane because I'm trying to get that
holiday season live does is the candy
cane chapstick one and I like it because
first up it's like peppermint so it can
I touch your lips not really but like it
makes me think that I didn't so now that
my face is basically not red anymore
I'm gonna go and add some color and
depth to it and all that whatnot stuff
I'm gonna go to my favorite bronzer so
this is the Sephora collection one and
this is perfect for like contouring but
not having like too cold of a contour
like just like that doesn't make sense
but this one's super good and I'm going
to go to the Bahama Mama for Rosie
and when I say contour like I don't
really need contour I just mean like a
little bit of definition like suck in my
cheeks and then smile does everything so
a second you nice smile and then it kind
of gives you that guideline of word put
your contour or runs or whatever so and
then oh so I'm gonna move on to a little
bit of eyeshadow and what I've been
using lately is a mixture of bronzer and
orange eyeshadow so I've been using the
modern renaissance for this so I take
but you couldn't easily probably find
your second orange eyeshadow if I dip a
little bit into burnt orange going right
there and then I top it off and then I
dip a little bit of it into the Bahama
Mama and that is what I apply for my
eyeshadow so I know my eyeshadow done
and my face makeup I'm gonna go on to
eyebrows ony I get so much hate on my
eyebrows like they're just like little
twigs I like they're struggling
you guys don't comment I don't know what
I'm doing wrong so actually if you guys
do want to give me here my eyebrows at
least tell me what I'm doing wrong
because that I can like
sit I'm going to go in with my ELF
pomade and this is in the shade medium
brown and this is honestly like one of
the best dupes for the honest rz1 and
it's literally four bucks so I'm totally
recommend that one and I'm skiing so
spoolie and first brush up my eyebrows
and I dip a little bit into the pomade
and then I like smooth it out into the
lid dad please be quiet were combing
okay and then I'm gonna go in and I like
- I actually was watching Mitchell
kimchi's tutorial on her girl you really
good eye rest anyway but she brushes it
up and then she like fills in where
there's just like corn cobs and it looks
worn after that wait so I made it so I
brought in my eyebrows you can just pull
like a walk her veil I was watching this
fun youtuber and she was like okay I'm
gonna do my eyebrows and she did them
and she said I think they look super
good today
and I personally I didn't think they
look good so I don't want to be that one
person that thinks that I look good and
then they don't so comment what I'm
doing wrong if I am doing them okay and
then it that wraps up my eyebrows so I'm
now gonna do just a little bit liner to
my did the lash line click on your lash
line I'm just gonna go in with a little
bit of brow gel eyeliner by supports
disappered one and it's it works really
well so I like this one I'm just going
to define my lashes a little bit more so
when I like curl them and do them
and then I just kind of keep my fear and
smudge it out a little bit and get rid
of the excess I'm gonna go in with just
a little bit I'm not scared
well first they're gonna comb my assets
there so straight my ashes they like
literally curved down because they're
just I got I got my dad's eyelashes my
dad has super straight eyelashes so I
blame I feel like I sound so nasally oh
this is the covergirl waterproof lash
blast this is so good it always will
always go back to this one I just think
the weather is beautiful today and it is
speaking such a positive ice Ayad see
there's so many annoying people no
public schools fine do you know what I
have not eaten in a long time look head
express it's probably good my skin
favorite beach ever like it's a good
response to everything like your mom
told you to go clean your room it's like
the perfect response for everything he
just never turns on film
oh okay so maybe taking a little bit of
glossy a solid scope this is like a
cream highlighter super natural looking
and so that's right I'm definitely not
any nikkietutorials when it comes to
high rider like I just like more than
more natural look and I think it's
flying if you like that super plane I
just my sweat comes in for that so and
I'm a little
okay toss anyway I think that wraps up
my basic tutorial this was more of a
just a casual video so if I submit
thumbs up I know I'm a very aware that
albeit over there the same but you guys
should all always request them so I'm
just trying to please you guys if you
comment hate on my eyebrows at least at
least told me what I'm doing wrong cuz
it does not help to tell me that I look
unclean but that's about it so our guys
enjoy today's video if you did like
button smash your subscribe button funny
voice is just putting out such good
vices as happiest I've ever been in my
life
bye guys we'll see you guys in my next
video yukata Chava you know it wrapped
in you aren't a show
