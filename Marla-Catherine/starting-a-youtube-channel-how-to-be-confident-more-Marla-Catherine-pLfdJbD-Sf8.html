snapchat Q&amp;amp;A and I got some snacks to
keep me company
just some apples need water and water
and let's just step started so I asked
you guys on snapchat to ask you
questions and if you do not know my
snapchat it's a Marla Kathryn
so go add me like right now so start off
with Rayleigh Joe when you do for how
are you so hoping it and look up to your
self-esteem up I think just telling
yourself that you're pretty or myself at
your vehicle every day and now comparing
yourself helps a lot so and you only
have like three seconds so I couldn't
show them I put it in I wrote it the
next snapshots from me mouth okay so the
first question from her was how did I
grow my channel across um just posting
consistently collaborating a lot
basically up you just have to hope that
you grow how do you not be happy when
you can't just listen to good music
starting yourself with good things
read good quotes read good books don't
stay away from things that are going to
bring you down maybe if your friends
aren't that good
reevaluate you are and friends next
question is what's your ethnicity so I
am a quarter Latino so if you did not
know my grandma is from El Salvador and
so I'm quarter-latino because my dad
path line and then there was my family's
white so that's about it and then they
also asked how old am I and third and 13
right I'm 13 how do you watch 13 reasons
why I love you Oh too so I don't watch
their G reasons why but like the first
episode like first five minutes there's
like 10 upwards not my thing so I just
turned off the show hey Abby so much my
question is why do you turn 14 I took 14
June my friend wanted to be in the photo
so cute when do I 3:14 I turned 14 on
May 11th I was born in 2003 so I'm super
excited turn 14 so if you like my 13 for
like my holes realized I was like this
has been the longest year of my life
okay the next question is from botoxing
101 I get inspiration for videos in the
confidence to to start a YouTube channel
via inspiration for from other youtubers
basically so I love Conan gray if you
did not know it's a little obvious by
now by look kinda great so I will get a
lot of inspiration from him but also
just other
like my age and people have looked at
this thing amount of subscribers uh to
see what they're doing um yeah I really
do inspiration from anyone and I also
had a confidence to join YouTube channel
I had the hardest time starting with the
YouTube channel I was really debating
get kicking it down through a little
while so that I just got over the fear
of like other people judging me don't
say you shouldn't stop you shouldn't not
do what you like to do just because
other people are bringing you down about
it so like you want to do you can apply
your creepies you're going to get bully
for it just still do it and then those
report the bowling don't let go tell a
teacher so I wasn't necessarily ever
bullied about my youtube channel I super
free to start my youtube channel so if I
was going to get bullied for having one
but I wasn't it was actually complete
opposite I was actually getting a lot of
harassment to be inside one of my
youtube videos people are honest maybe
in one of your YouTube videos people I
did a Mandela went to my school we're
talking to me about it so I got a lot of
positive I got a lot of positive
feedback and so just don't be scared to
go for it one dating YouTube channel
just do it the next question is from Ava
way and she my favorite song at the
moment is Willy Wonka and run with white
mis-advice ha mr. sho-me
awaited my favorite song right now I
know it's not like the Willy Wonka theme
song a promise I'm kind of a famous
baseball one conspecific it's Willy
Wonka by a rut hey did the non-school
and expertise from across scholars so
Bochy asked if I was going to get a 1
million dollar - what would be the first
thing goodbye and white the first thing
you're probably buy is probably like buy
a plane that we can travel anywhere in
want maybe a car and I can't drive so my
next question is do I like my braces and
getting hurt she's getting hurt in a
month so they heard like the first like
four days but you can't really eat
anything for like the first week is the
Cybex communities closer than not they
really don't hurt you they like get used
to them so it is wandering outside mu
George asks favorite strain you're

well thank you so much anytime you guys
complement the videos we're coming to
meet you guys are something so sweet and
citrusy thank you so if you have to my
favorite book is I used to be a big time
reader but now I can't really find it
like a good book to like that I actually
get into if you have to suggest books
comic get all your favorite books I love
to read by just now we can find a good
book but I read this one called the face
on the milk carton so this girl that I
seized her face on the milk carton of
when she was like for like realizes like
that her parents never have like older
folk like baby pictures of her so she
thinks she suspect that she was I cannot
conceive the baby and so it was a really
good book it's really intense but it's
like really good so I'd suggest that you
guys really forgive reading about seven
times one asking question at what age
did you know you wanted to be youtuber I
decided at the young age of 12 to become
a youtuber Oh a I'm only 13 honestly I
didn't really think of YouTube I didn't
think of Instagram I was not into that
at all whatsoever

literally their number one fan like

favorite day of the week because they
uploaded the next one is from an essay

into modeling I'm not a professional
model whatsoever just an instrumental
model
I just cooperate with a lot
photographers Instagram so it looks like
I'm a model

question comes from baby dust 2 49 and

April Carver 14 as how do I sneak a cow
