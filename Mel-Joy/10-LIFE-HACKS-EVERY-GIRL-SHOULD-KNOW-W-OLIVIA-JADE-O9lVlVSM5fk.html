looks good we're high please take it
away hey guys so welcome back to my
Channel today I'm a special guest with
me this is Olivia Olivia hi Jade on
YouTube I'll put her link down below so
click her face subscribe to our Channel
Hey so today we're going to be doing a
life hack video in the video similar to
this on my channel you guys seem to like
it so you get another one we did 10 on
her channel and we're doing 10 more on
my channel so 20 in total I think is a
good amount of yeah be research again
and you know we came up with the best
ones can I go first yeah she's good so
one of my personal favorites if you guys
are a fan of pizza and you got a job
okay that's all 2016 you can use the
coupon 25 off get 25% off your entire
purchase every time every time you all
might owe me though right yeah so it's
like you order P to your house or
something that is the first one back
because I didn't want to get a discount
that's a good one and this sounds a
little different you are doing your
makeup and you have fall out you can use
like double-sided sticky tape and just
wrap it on your finger and then tap and
then like that then you're good you're
golden
I think that yeah I hate that like if
you're doing this really heavy look
mm-hmm alright so my second one also has
to do is food but this is a microwave
cake in a mug so what you do is you take
cake mix and mix it with angel food mix
and then add water and you heat it in
the microwave for one minute
just like in a mug and it'll come out
and like a little cake and it's only 150
calories so that's like a good snack and
it's yummy and it's easy
so I've about the Cuban and as cake cake
exactly so why not okay have you guys
seen this new mine are all be new for
some reason I think but have you seen
this new he's making
we're us everywhere yeah so if you don't
know what is you can look up videos on
YouTube but you don't have like a loose
powder to bake with if you have just a
pressed powder you can scrape it up and
then it'll be movies pattern it no beak
with like eyeshadows ci9 shadows or
everyone anything so I thought this one
was really cute if you want to send
yourself like a little motivational
emails to like read in the future you
could go to futureme.org and like write
yourself email and then it'll send it to
you on like a certain date so it's like
you're doing like a big thing one day
and you just want like a little
motivational email from yourself you can
just open it on that day and it'll be
from my caliber long ago that is cute I
think that's a really cute you do that
if you want to make a cream shadow you
don't go and buy one you have some old
like eyeshadow that you don't really use
anymore you can mix the aqua eyeshadow
with a primer and then you can just buy
like a separate pot or whatever and then
you come in there and you got a cream
eyeshadow and it works if you mix it
with primary like glass alone huh yeah
oh okay so if you guys are fan of
wearing rings I love wearing my knees as
you can tell but sometimes you get that
like green ring I actually might have
one under my double you get like the
green rings or on your finger from a
medal or whatever if you coat your rings
with with clear nail polish you won't
get the green rings anymore so I've
about different um ik hungry
yeah that's a really good one especially
of like cuz some cheap rings you're like
really cool yeah but then you don't want
to get the girl or your hands turned
green and then I look like Jack true um
my next one is if you don't own like a
brow gel you can use chapstick one roz
and then it like sticks them down even
know are you Hanna's hairspray but I
think I would prefer tastic just cuz
it's like you can even put it like on
the little spooley too like if you have
one and just come with that I like that
B looks like it what do I have to like
latter than joke sometimes gel feel so
sad like I feel like that probably comes
out
yeah all right so this one I think is
really helpful just because if you guys
ever get those like deodorant stains
like sometimes you'll just be like
putting on a shirt and then you'll just
see one because like it comes on in it
or whatever
so like fellow white stains on your
shirts you take a dryer sheet you know
like you put in your dryer when you wash
your clothes them and then you just like
rub it in circular motions and it'll
come out right away you don't have to
like wash it or do anything like that so
I'm definitely going to be using that in
the meter but like that one mine's not
beauty this is my last one all right and
ask me with food so there we go more
food here yeah so you know when you're
making pancakes and then you have to
like make the whole batter and you're
just kind of like it's just kind of a
hassle like pouring it into like the pan
from with the bowl sometimes like those
are my cousin Bert just not me so if you
use your intellect pick up mayonnaise
mayonnaise ketchup anymore make sure
it's really empty though and clean that
would be disgusting if you mix that but
uh it makes ISA ooh that we got it I
don't recommend that if you like put
your pancakes Hank in Dermott English
electricity um you put your pancake mix
in the bottle then you can just like or
like squirt it out and then on the pan
no like you know even you like little I
can do it em familiy yeah I go to like
shapes that'd be so cute like for
birthday you could spell out happy
birthday and pink I'm not even gonna lie
right now that's really good I like that
one so make wou work oh my god those
were all for like a thumbnail like I was
trying to find one thumbnail talk about

problem in my first video yeah I'm gonna
