know what I'm saying so you know hey
guys today's video is going to be a more
chill video it's currently 12:30 6:00 in
the morning I got that mood where you're
like I want to film a video you like
have everything you want to save
yourself alright if I talk quieter from
being read or anything I'm sorry it's
late I'm kind of dysfunctional I'm
trying not to wake my parents up
hopefully making here me that's why I'm
in this room because I didn't want the
mom this video is a fairly spontaneous
video the reason I'm not sleeping is
because I took a nap from 3 to 6 so and
why do I this video is going to be how
you can make 2016 the best year possible
for you honestly that 16 is to try to
have one of the best years of my life
and I have 10 things written down on my
phone to share with you guys of how you
could possibly do that also if the
lighting is really weird I'm sorry I'm
really trying to experiment with it one
of my studio lights broke so I only have
wine I'm ordering another one I really
like videos like this right you just
kind of sit down and talk to you guys
about just life in general I guess
they're one of my favorite views to me
this is just like the real top things
that I want to share with you guys so
hopefully improve your life if you guys
like videos like these let me know
because I believe I'm making them so
number one is to take risks and say yes
I know this can be a hard thing and what
I mean take risk I mean safe risks not
like really dangerous risks because I
want you guys to be safe but like safe
risks and saying yes also like if a
group of people invite you out there
like you're usually not that close with
you like I should I just say who watch
Netflix
or like go out to the social encounter
that I barely know these people try to
say yes because like you don't know what
it could lead to or what could happen
you know like you don't know if you
could end up being really close friends
of them are like really enjoying them as
people try to say yes as much as you can
personally I want to experience new
things in 2016 I love making new friends
and remember if you say yes and you end
up going and you feeling
obviously you have the option it's just
the fact that you took a chance like you
try something new just the baskin allow
you to have like a whole bunch of new
experiences if you guys like seeing take
risks and try to say yes more but number
two is create some goals and stick to
them if you guys filming on Twitter or
tweeted this something that I've been
trying to focus on in 2016 is creating
goals and sticking to them and trying to
accomplish them some my goals in 2016
are to eat healthier I'm gonna just take
care of my body more and to focus on
YouTube more like I want to produce more
videos for you guys and put more effort
into them and like try to make them the
best that they can be ya know yeah and I
just sound like a polis of rules that
I'm trying to slowly accomplish out
there I have done this before you make a
goal and you just kind of like let it
sit there and yell oh yeah I'm doing it
like whatever
honestly like 2016 try to accomplish
your goals just stick to them like work
for it everyday when you accomplish your
goal it's gonna feel so like rewarding
and good but it's definitely something
that I'm focusing on more in 2016
creating goals and sticking to them and
accomplishing them so number three is to
focus on you this is definitely a hard
work for well for me at least especially
like I love making the people around me
happy like seeing other people happy
makes me happy if I had to choose to
make someone happy make me happy you
know I probably choose to make someone
else happy because it's like yeah I
don't know that's like a whole new topic
happiness it's you gotta really like
focus on you because some people focus
so hard on other people and things like
that that they just kind of forget about
themselves and it's like girl that you
are living your life like you need to
focus on me like you need to do what
makes you happy and like what's good for
you focusing on other people what
they're thinking of you and how you want
them to see us it's just like worrying
about all of that it's just so stressful
to you you know just like to improve
little things about your life whether it
be like physical things like working out
or anything healthy or mental things
like thinking good thoughts and not
stressing out and then for focusing on
the interest to things that make you
happy because personally happiness is
something that I really want
song 2016 I just want to be purely and
genuinely happy and just to make the
other people around me like genuinely
happy because I think happiness is a
good thing and a very important thing in
life they can be a whole another video
if you guys want me to do that let me
know but I can talk about that for every
time so number four is to stay organized
this is definitely something that I can
struggle with just cleaning everything
out like getting rid of old stuff being
organized is definitely gonna help you
feel like fresher for the new year and
also just like organizing your time like
from me organizing school of social life
basketball and sports and YouTube is
definitely something I'm trying to work
on more so I can accomplish everything I
want to accomplish and not be really
stressed out and once you I like are
organized it'll just help so much more
so they'll be in my room with my clothes
and my makeup things like that or like
my schoolwork you know like having a
plan or having a calendar writing things
down like when you're gonna do it make
Michael schedule for yourself any way
that it can like help you to take that
stress off you of like being unorganized
I think would really help you in 2016 so
number five is to take care of your body
this is something that I have really
been trying to focus on more in 2016
I've been trying to eat healthier foods
not even just for the reason I only like
I'm gonna be thinning but I was like I
honestly want to take care of my body
because this is something you're gonna
have for your whole life now so I think
it really helps like your mental state
like your happiness I honestly think
that throught eating healthier in 2016
it has helped me and I just felt like
more fresh and more clean and just like
that or you know do you know the same so
I think take care of your body would
definitely help you and do that sixty
all right my camera died since no point
twelve but we're going to finish this
number six is to find something that you
love doing I guess like a hobby but just
something that you can resort to to
cheer yourself up like they're having a
bad day my thinking is kind of you to be
honest whenever I'm in pain I mean I
just read your guys's comments and they
chew me up I'll just kind of focus on
like improving my layout or editing or
just anything and it'll get my mind off
it and it'll make me feel better so find
that thing that you kind of can turn to
you're in a bad mood and you don't want
to like talk to someone about it or
anything you just kind of like want to
focus on something else like a hobby
just it's always nice to have like a
good hobby that you can turn to when you
need it or just for fun you know like
it's good for school
who's number seven is to surround
yourself with loving people one of my
biggest pieces of advice to people is to
surround yourself by people that you
love and that love you and people that
are not toxic and it'll make you sad or
anything just be with your friends your
family I just want to be on their terms
everyone I'm gonna have problems I don't
know issues with people it's just like I
can't wait long
I don't know just just try yourself um
so yeah do that
number eight is to change your habits if
you have any bad habits change them get
rid of all your bad habits like
personally let's see bad habit will be
hanging up really late getting no sleep
during school just like any little bad
habits that you know you have because
you know you have at least one probably
just try to get rid of them you know try
to make them in a good habits done - bad
habits yeah number not well number nine
is to be positive I have had my times
where I just look at everything in a
negative way I'm just like there's no
way this can be fixed like this is just
bad luck now if you've gotta look at the
positives like always count your
blessings don't be the negative Nelly
there will be times where you need to
see the downside of things if you're
like in a situation and you think you
can't be fixed
you just think everything is sucking
right now you gotta look at the
positives you know like you can't let
yourself get too down on yourself but I
mean everyone's gonna have sucky times
I'm gonna be honest that's what's gonna
happen people are gonna have their sexy
times but it's just the way that you
take in those times you know because you
gotta go I can learn from this already
just sitting and be like damn my life
sucks you gotta focus on the positive
stuff so number 10 the last thing is to
be you 100% you just be you that's how
you're gonna be the happiest why would
you just pretend to be someone you're
not
and to be with the wrong crowd being you
just it's kind of the foundation of like
everything else because once you're like
good with yourself doing Snoopy things
or whatever feel like you're weird like
okay better than normal I don't know
it's just all about how do you want to
live your life honey I would like think
good okay how do I want to live my life
in 2016 do I want to focus on being
happy doing our focus on being
successful and then focus on that but
always remember to be yourself I guess
those are all the things that I'm gonna
talk about in this video just focus on
the important things
you can't just let yourself focus on if
you're like obsessing over this one
small little thing remember like hey
what's important like what is the actual
important thing in this situation I'm
kind of just rambling it's late it's 180
