much all the rules once I pick a winner

to give me your address I won't do
anything weird with your address I'm not

comfortable sending me your address just
send me your post-office box and I'll

underscore joy with three wise and my
tumblr is just my way of teenage July so
follow me there I'd really appreciate it
and I'm gonna be wanting to do a Q&amp;amp;A
soon so I really want to get questions
from you guys so make sure to follow me
so let's just get into the phrases so
the first thing you guys are gonna be
winning i think is pretty suitable for
fall because it is a new to lip color
it's a wet and wild matte lipstick
and bear it all and I've just been
really loving nudes and math so I
thought this would be perfect for fall
and nothing too bright or anything
coming on camera a little darker than it
is it's a really pretty color I just
think if you dab this on it'll look
great you'll be winning this the next
thing you'll be winning which I'm
jealous of you guys because I really
want this but it is the nudes palette
from Maybelline this just came out a
couple weeks ago and it just has the
prettiest colors anyways and it shows
you like it looks you can do on the fact
I think these colors are so gorgeous and
so wearable and I think this is perfect
for just an everyday look so the next
thing you guys will be winning is kind
of random but I thought I'd throw it in
it is a brandy Melville sticker and it
just says John cat 1981 New York City
this is not like the biggest thing or
anything don't worry that's just a
little through done thank you guys the
next two things these Rimmel London
Salon pro with nail polishes they're the
Kate Moss line the first one is 7-eleven
punk rock I just think this is an
amazing gray its I've just been seeing a
lot of Gray's on people's nails and it
has a little like purple tint to it and
I think it's perfect for fall and then
the next nail color you'll be winning is
7:13 brick pop and it's just a brighter
blue I just think this looks so pretty
on nails and I've gotten compliments
when I wear bright blues like this
you'll be winning those and then the
next thing you'll be winning is this not
your mother's clean freak refreshing dry
shampoo and I'm just giving you guys the
travels both travel sized cuz this is
perfect for like school and traveling if
you have super oily hair and you don't
want to take a shower or whatever
because you're throwing the next day at
school or something I'm not actually
using it for you just like spray it in
at the roots like I had the full size of
this and I love it so I definitely
wanted to give you guys this because
this is so helpful I mean it's just so
home so then the biggest thing you guys
will be winning is a hair curler from
Conair I know I saw this and I really
wanted it's one-inch so I think it's
like the perfect size for kind of not
super tight but not super loose waves
just in between
it's creates medium curls if you want
this to become a wand you can just
unscrew like this part like that clip
art this comes in handy for like dances
or your school's prom or anything like
that
you use this in the dry shampoo you're
all set to go so anyways that is
everything you guys are gonna be winning
there's only gonna be one winner
and I'm sorry to say but this is not
going to be an international giveaway
but my next giveaways are going to be
international and bigger and more stuff
but this is just my first giveaway so I
thought I would start it small I hope
you guys enjoyed this video make sure to
enter I really want you guys to know how
much I appreciate you all and I'll see
you guys in my next video thanks for
