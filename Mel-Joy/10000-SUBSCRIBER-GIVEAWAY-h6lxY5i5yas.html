me Mel so long time no talk I had to
take a short break from you too it was
just like two weeks because I was having
finals and finishing the school year and
I was just really busy and couldn't find
time to film a YouTube video and I lent
my friend my camera and there's just no
time really
so before I start this video I wanted to
make the announcement that I am going to
Florida for 10 days starting on June 2nd
and I'm going with one of my best
friends so I thought that maybe we could
blog every day for 10 days and just show
what we've done and then I posted the
next morning if you guys would like to
see that comment down below so I know
that you guys want to see that if you
don't you can let me know too I think
that for the vlogs that I do in Florida
I would put on this channel and then
maybe if you guys wanted me to continue
vlogging I could make a second channel
for vlogging I don't know let me know
down below what you guys think if you
have not been on my channel recently you
might have not known that I hit 10,000
subscribers recently so I'm going to be
doing a giveaway for you guys and before
I get into the giveaway I want to talk
about the rules and also say thank you
tell you guys because it means a lot to
me that you guys have subscribed and
watched my videos and I never thought
that I would have gotten to 10,000 so
it's pretty cool so yeah the rules are
you have to live in the u.s. I'm not
going to be doing International shipping
sorry about that if any of you live
outside of the US you have to be 18 or
older or have your parents permission so
they know that I'm sending something to
your house so they don't get freaked out

I'm going to check if you guys subscribe
to my channel so make sure to do that so
yeah it should we get started it for the
for the prices I think we should my new
laughing and if this setup is different

lighting right here and I didn't want to
get out my studio lights so the first
prize and the biggest prize okay so the
first thing you guys are going to be

best sellers kit so it has everything
