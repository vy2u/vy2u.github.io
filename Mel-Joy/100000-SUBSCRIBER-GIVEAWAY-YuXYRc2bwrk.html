going to be a 100,000 subscriber
giveaway this video is dedicated to you
guys because I'm so shocked that I hit a
hundred thousand subscribers I never
thought I would get anywhere near there
and before I get into the prizes and the
rules and everything like that I just
wanted to say a humongous thank you to
each and every one of you that has
subscribed and it has been supporting me
through my youtube life and it's I can't
picture like a hundred thousand people
like it's just like when I see the
number I'm like okay and then when I try
to like picture it that's just like
insane to me um I know I'm focused a
little late because I've passed a
hundred thousand out but when I hit up
2000 I was having a really busy time
with school and sports and I didn't have
time to film a video or go get the
prizes or anything like that I'd rather
get it up now than ever so yeah I just
wanted to say thank you for all your
guys's support and love you guys are
honestly the best like I know I never
thought that I would ever get this far
in YouTube and YouTube is my passion I
love it I love making videos I love
talking to you guys you guys are so
amazing and I just wanted to say thank
you for being there for me through
everything so you have to thank you guys
for that I'm going to be giving away
some prizes I decided to do quality over
quantity for this giveaway um and also
I'm thinking of having some holiday game
boys that's why I tried to not too much
in this video so let me know down below
if you guys what I'm going to do that
though the first prize I'm gonna start
with the smallest prize is this lipstick
set from Tarte
there's four lipsticks there's a high
performance natural
six they looked really nice really good
quality really pretty colors especially
for fall coming up and guys this the
second thing is this Juicy Couture
perfume scent and I thought this was
really cool it's a cute little box that
opens like this and then it comes just
way perfume it comes with Viva La Juicy
noir yeah um
Viva La Juicy and I reduced the Couture
I smelled them at the store and they
smell just so good so I decided that I
would treat you guys to three perfumes I
don't know it gives you options I just
get third thing which I actually think
is really cool
so it's this two-faced set I'm not going
to open it just cuz it's for you guys
but here um on the inside it's like a
little house it comes with three pilots
and then a better than sex mascara I
think it's a mini size I've always
wanted to try that mascara so if you
guys didn't let me know how it is
so it comes just three pallets the
pallets are about I don't a store
they're about like this big and it comes
with six different eyeshadows in each
palette and then three different blushes
and the Broncos it looks like it's bad
and the palettes are so cute but it's
like this little box and it comes on the
box and it's actually like a lot of
makeup um so I thought that was really
cool
so you have a little mix of your
eyeshadow and your blush and bronzer
your perfume and your lipstick and then
also actually over this is this makeup
bag it looks like you know that oil
spill things you see on tumblr it's like
that but it's like rainbow but it's like
silver snake skin and then gold
detailing the inside is the teal color
really pretty it's periwinkle detailing
and I'm just gonna put everything I can
fit in this bag I think it's only that I
don't think anything else will fit
nothing the last thing you can get is
this bag and it's from Trina there and
