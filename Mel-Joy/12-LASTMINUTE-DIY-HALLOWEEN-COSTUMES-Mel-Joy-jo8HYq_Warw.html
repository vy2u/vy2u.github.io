you
hey guys welcome back to my channel
apologies for the setup and is just
really quickly thrown together because I
real quick needed to film this intro
today is going to be a Halloween video
yes Halloween this is going to be 12
really last minute DIY Halloween
costumes a lot of these costumes it
would be really easy to just really
quickly throw them together not the type
of DIY where you have to go out buy
stuff come home so it all that stuff I
tried to do things where you could just
can easily just grab things around your
house and create a costume with it I
tried to do some funny ones that I
haven't really seen on YouTube so
hopefully that gives you guys some new
ideas and if you guys end up using any
of my costume ideas and end up being
them probably make sure to tag me in
them on Instagram and Twitter and I will
retweet favorite like comment all that
good stuff or just comment down below if
you're gonna be one of the costumes I
suggested I tried to make some of these
costumes transitioning from my tweens
into teens so more like you're stopping
trick-or-treating you're just hanging
off your friends or doing your own thing
whatever you're doing so some of them
are a little bit more mature some are
not as mature but I just thought that I
would make a little variety in there for
you guys if you guys want to learn how
to get 12 different last minute DIY
Halloween costumes make sure to stay
tuned and keep watching
in the Barbie
Barbie let's go on
bang
I'm like
we can
I wish you were here with me walking
just do nothing bad about a suede
I'll show you that is one in the same
baseball cats and same game it's easy
step up to the plate stop swinging one
place on our bets I'm sorry if I seem
uninterested or I'm not listening no I'm
in this for me truly I ain't got no
business here but since my friends are
here I just came to kick it oh really I
would rather be at home all by myself
not in this one with people who don't
even care about my well-being I don't
dance
no ask I don't need a bouquet and Agassi
darling it's better down where it's
wetter take it from me oh Elsa
gasps so lonely
