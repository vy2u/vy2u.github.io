a sixteenth birthday haul and if you
guys were not aware I turned 16 on
August 2nd I don't know when this video
is gonna be up but I thought that I
would make a video to share with you
guys how I was pretty sad to turn 16
I'll get my license pretty soon I cannot
wait I don't even mmm so I thought I'll
show you guys what I got from my family
and my friends I thought that I was only
bad gifts from my family because I was
planning to have a party later but my
friends ended up surprising me on my
birthday and I'm so awesome because I've
never been surprised before like I've
never had a surprise party I was cool
for me that was really nice they
surprised me at breakfast and then we
hung out the rest of the day and was so
much fun so they did of getting me gifts
everyone's gifts are so sweet before I
start stupid I just want to say thank
you to everyone and also a disclaimer
I'm not bragging in any way shape or
form I thought that you guys would like
to see this video guys like hauls and
this is what I got for my 16th birthday
so it's not further ado let's get
started we'll just start with the bigger
gift my pretty much main gift was the
Clarisonic Mia 3 and I have the money
Clarisonic for a very long time but I
never wanted to spend the money because
it's so expensive I think that this is
gonna help keep my skin clean keep my
face from breaking out and things like
that it also came with a travel bag that
has a little Clarisonic thing here very
cute it's just purple and mesh I also
came with the Clarisonic gentle hydro
cleanser yeah so I just got big third
one and this has three speeds it says
cleanses six times better than hands
alone I'm really excited to use this and
use it every time I wash my face and
hopefully it'll keep my skin nice and
clear probably the second biggest gift I
got for these hugs but these are
actually on sale because I was there
with
like oh I want those I've been wanting
of moccasins for a very long time this
is the newest version like that just
came out and they are these chestnut
colored moccasin they are so comfortable
I'll be wearing these to school good
amount of the year just saw my fit lazy
days they're so cute and comfortable and
these are so easy to just throw on and
like walk out the door or just chill at
home or do whatever but I really like
these and I have money needs for a very
long time so I'm happy that I got those
so then the next thing which is also a
pretty big gift I wasn't throwing about
this this was a surprise I was not
expecting this whatsoever my parents got
me a bed bridges necklace what my sister
turned 16 they got my sister a necklace
and when my mom turned 16 her parents
about her necklace so it's kind of like
something that runs in a family and it's
so beautiful it just comes with this
purple box and then this box also can
you open it and it is my birthstone
it's a peridot my birthstone is August
and that's what the August one looks
like it's the screen but I think it's so
pretty
it just I really like it so this is
probably like the main 16th gift and I
think it's very pretty and elegant and
yeah very sweet of my parents to get me
that the next thing my parents taught me
was the naked 3 palette and this is
beautiful so I had the Naked 2 palette
but broke and it's just a mess now and
it's hard to use I had my eye on this
for the longest time and the colors are
gorgeous and I've been getting into
wearing eyeshadow more just looks like
this no mirror was good but they're so
pretty and I'm so excited to wear this
and use this and try things out okay
with some powder potions the original
Edenton and anti-aging and then I also
comes with the brush we'll ended shadow
blending brush this was very nice of
them and I'm so excited to try this out
and if you guys want any looks with this

definitely make sure to do that for you
