today's video is going to be 17 things
that I learned when I was 17 I don't
want to sound cliche or anything but
honestly I really believe that my 17
year old self was like a completely
different person at the start of being
seventeen versus at the end just because
seventeen was such a whirlwind for me
emotionally physically all this stuff I
think I've gotten a lot wiser from this
year so I thought that I would just
share my was done because it was
definitely the year of like realizing
stuff no but for real I learned so much
this year I think has to do is like you
to by just growing up as a whole and
just dealing with all the stuff life
throws at you because there's a lot that
life throws at you and also if you
couldn't tell I'm in a new background
because I'm currently in my new
apartment oh my god I haven't shown you
guys on my main channel yet but there is
a video on my blog channel all about my
18th birthday and like moving in and
there's definitely going to be more
moving blogs coming they've already been
vlogging a lot I'm going to edit those
and get those up soon so sticking for
that on my vlog Channel movies vlogs I'm
so excited I also really quickly wanted
to announce that your girl made a thing
so on insta so if you guys want to
follow my fence so to see really random
funny throwback whatever type of photos
then you can do that the username will
be right here and also down below with
extra joy without the e in extra I
thought what I'm super excited about for
that Instagram is that I'm only
following you guys on it it's for you
guys I'm constantly following you guys
every day it just goes up every day
because why the hell not my full speed
is you guys are just so sick like it's
never been that before and I thought it
would be the best way to you know stay
in touch with you guys like 24/7 it's
still fun to actually like see your
photos and interact with you guys and
it's I don't know I'm excited about it I
just thought this video would be helpful
for people and hopefully it is so let's
get started so I have 17 things on this
handy-dandy list because knowing me I
would forget it if I didn't write it
down let's see there's just so many
things I want to talk about because
trust your instincts / trust your gut
because for me I really make a lot of
decisions based on other people if you
know I mean or I did a lot a lot a lot
so for me I just really figured out that
it's like trust your gut that little
feeling that just pops up in your gut
like right away your first reaction is
something means more than you know
do you know what I mean I never realized
that until I started really thinking
about like what I was doing and what
instincts I was following in this also
on my heart or my mind my gut or
whatever I like just overthought
everything and now I'm more like if I
have a feeling within me I know it means
something and I know I'm gonna act upon
it if that makes Eddie says I hope it
does now definitely just trust yourself
with your own decisions with how you
want to live and your gut and yeah so
this one I think is super important and
I really just I just didn't know this is
the thing I don't not everyone has the
same part of you and that for me was so
hard to realize because when I was
younger I was like oh like everyone's
promise we're all gonna act the same I
was going to be civil blah blah that's
what you think when you're young you
grow up and you're like what the hell
like nah this one in a way can be sad I
even put a little sad face next to it
just because you could be acting a
certain way that might you know have
more heart within it if that makes any
sense like you could go out of your way
to do so many things for one person just
because you care so much about them but
you have to realize that not everyone is
going to treat you the same way that you
treat other people not everyone is like
you well it's like everyone's their own
person and everyone has a different
heart and has a different way of
whatever you know but for me what I
learned from that is that you just have
to treat others how you want to be
treated in middle school that was
literally like art what we'd be like to
do would be treated the golden rule
that's like what I grew up about which
is which is cool because I have had that
within me my whole life so I guess I
grew up the same way where it's just
like I want to treat everyone how I want
to be treated now of course you want to
be treated good and loved and cared for
it so I guess don't get hurt when people
don't see you the same way as you treat
them because they don't have the same
thought process the same you know
priorities as you do change your
behavior towards someone don't try to
change them and all
so know your treatment I'm just going to
throw that one answer fun but no your
treatment know how people should be
treating you don't let yourself take all
the bad treatment you get from people or
whatever like it's just BS I used to put
up with a lot of toxic people in my life
a lot of fakeness a lot of this just
because I was like this is the life like
even though it's going to be filled with
this I'm just going to roll with it and
see what happens and I realized that did
not make me happy at all
but even though if someone's like a
snake or something like this you can't
necessarily change them do you know what
I mean it's also just not the right way
to go about things like I need to change
you as a person like you need to be
changed it's like let them be who they
want but treat them accordingly to that
limb exist if when your best friend is
ignoring you for weeks and whatever it's
like no your treatment just know what
you deserve - because you deserve better
than you think I'm a hundred percent
sure of that so when going along the
lines of that the next one the fine
don't know which one we're on remove the
toxic slash take people from your life
just because when I did that it's like
it's not even necessarily removing them
I'd get on my life you know but it's
like ease back on how much attention you
give them because if they're not
treating you the way you deserve
you know like what's the point you need
to find people that make you happy and
make you feel like you are your best
self every single day you need to
genuinely want to hang out with the
people you hang out with you know and if
you don't somebody's going to just going
to mess up you but when it comes down to
it you just really have to focus on the
people that make you happy and remove
the toxic and fake people from your life
or it's just going to eat you alive bro
life is too short to have your life so
the BS so the next one I want to talk
about is all about being truthful and
saying how you feel and I know that my
sounds super scary because it did to me
a year ago I was someone who didn't feel
like I could tell people how I felt
because it didn't really matter I always
thought that would be my life like I'd
have to worry about that stuff whatever
but I thought about this so much and in
the end like why wouldn't you want to
live your life telling the people you
love that you love them and that you
about them and if someone's sneaking you
then be honest like why are you staking
these you don't mean it's like for me
when I hang out with someone and I
really enjoy their company
I'll tell them I'll just tell them
straight out like even if I knew I got
what they're for sometimes like hey like
you're really cool dude like I just want
to let you know that it could make
someone's day first of all just by
speaking the truth and saying how you
feel you could literally change them one
whole day maybe even their month maybe
they're having a terrible terrible time
right now you just never know and it's
also not worth like sitting in silence
your whole life like knowing what you
want to say and you just can't say it
don't take that in a mean way like if
you don't like someone don't go up to
them start cursing them out that it's
not I'm saying I don't know make sure
the people you care about know you care
about them and also for the truthful
part just don't please don't lie lies
will get you just dig deeper and deeper
and deeper into your problems than just
being straightforward when someone lies
to me I take that as a bigger deal than
than just being straight up and saying
something that I wouldn't necessarily
want to hear but it's better than
finding out about it from someone else
or realizing that the person literally
lied to your face like that will hurt
way more than just the truth so hope
that helped
I just realized I've been filming for
way too long for just a couple things
outside that so I'm just going to keep
these short I'm just going to say them
have a little explanation and move on
because I ramble I rant I could
literally talk about all this stuff
forever so the next one is to love your
parents and be appreciative of them me
and my parents have had kind of a
special relationship since I've grown up
especially me my dad like unbreakable
bond between us I mean there's a time
where you're just a teenager and you
don't really care now Dhamma can just
suck like whatever they just want to
stop me from doing all the stuff that I
want to do you do have to realize
there's a little brought you onto this
earth and they love you more than you
know you're literally their child I
don't know treat them with love and
respect because your parents can be your
parents your parents can be your friends
and you can talk to them and hang out
with them and just have a great
relationship I tell my parents every day
that I love them just because I do and I
want them to know that do what you want
to do and I know that sounds so like
cliche and boring and simple I don't
know if this is just me but I would
think a lot of things that I would think
about doing so now I've got this oh it's
like if I want to do it I'll do it
who are you living life or you or
someone else do you know I mean it's
I realized I'm gonna live my life for me
so I'm gonna do what I want but be safe
about it also like I know you guys Wendy
Stood Still you never know
I'm definitely following your governess
like just do what you want literally
just hear that hear that and take it and
do what you want
do you know what I mean so the next one
is balance and when I mean balance I
mean like everything no like food
working out all that stuff also just
your own personal time make sure you
have a little time where you can just be
by yourself you know and chill because
as much as some people don't like to do
that nice to hate to do that I used to
hate to be left alone in a room by
myself and that was one of my favorite
things I just think I've become a wiser
person from hanging out myself and
discovering Who I am more as a person
and how I would want my life to be still
get and also balancing social media is
so important it's just so important I
wanted people understand how much social
media just takes an impact on you does
that make sense has an impact on you
there we go I wish I could spend all day
on social media talking to guys and
communicating and all that stuff but
social media can really put like a
strain on yourself because you're so
caught up in how everyone looks and how
everyone action all stuff in this
perfect little society is in social
media but in reality that just doesn't
exist like I love social media I think
it's changed a lot over time so for me
I'll try to balance it you know don't
spend all day just sitting on your phone
like that's just not good for you you
know and also socializing balance your
socializing I think it's different for
every individual it's your own balance
find your own balance live every day
like it's your last I don't even think I
necessarily do this every day like I
just really don't think I do but I do
think it's an important thing for people
to just hear yeah hearing that right now
makes me think like what should i do
today that like I wouldn't usually do
and I would want to do you don't I mean
like even just reading this myself that
was my thought process life is short and
long it's a mix it's weird but just live
every day like you asked
Yolo have no regrets no regrets bro
don't care what people think about you I
know this one is so much harder said
than done
I think social media gives us the
pressure of upholding a persona and
stuff you know which
on my private you guys see that I post
literally photos of me in PJs with
Tinkerbell on them be yourself bro and
love yourself for it I just don't care
it's so hard to do it and I haven't even
completely figured it out but I've
gotten so much better at it you know you
can't care you can't take it all so
don't abuse that and don't be like me
and because you're like I just don't
care you know don't let it go to your
head
you can still care about people be a
nice person yet be confident who you are
and not care what people think about you
I guess super super hard to get there
I'm not even in yet but I have made some
progress so I know it's possible I know
it's possible and I'm going to get there
I'm gonna get there the next one is wake
up early when I wake up early I just get
so much more stuff done
I feel more productive I feel just
better than an individual I don't know
what it is I really think wakes up early
just helps your body not like super
early I'm not talking like 7 I'm an
important but I try to do no later than
like 9:00 or 9:30 because that's where I
get into my lazy mode where I don't do
anything and I sit on the couch all day
so bad oh yeah wake up early get at
least eight hours of sleep and I I think
I'm not a doctor
don't quote me on that yet so sleep girl
you needed it and boys every gender
muesli I realize I have people just on
here so I'm just going to finish the
last ones but I really think I've said
enough to the point where it would be 17
things so these are my two favorite ones
hands down I save them for last because
they're the best and I think the most
important in the end it's your life so
you need to be there for yourself that's
a very typical thing people say you
don't care about yourself love yourself
self love but I think it's easier said
than done because I don't know like life
just throws a lot to fit you and you get
down on yourself to be yourself done so
you're not doing enough like whatever
this is just stuff that I've dealt with
I'm not trying to categorize everyone
this is just me it's a very scary
feeling knowing that like the way you
like your life right now it's probably
not going to be like that in a couple
years you know not everything stays the
same we're constantly changing our
society everything and that's going to
come with relationships changing that's
going to come with you know location
like where you live changing there's
just so much change but through that
change you need to just 100% be there
for yourself
that's just my biggest piece of advice
but the last piece of advice
put yourself first that's also one of
our biggest pieces of advice because I
used to always put myself last I
wouldn't care and I would think that
making other people happy is what made
me happy I just thought if I tried to
make as many people in my life happy
that happiness would be brought to me
and then after a couple years of doing
that other bro where's my positive you
know it's just like interested because
you're so caught up in worrying about
everyone else you forget to put yourself
first and to love yourself and in the
end that's what matters you've got to
care for you so they think it's a
necessary thing and as you probably
might number one piece of buzz you just
got to care for you it's just crazy how
much will change your whole perspective
on life when you realize that it's your
life and you need to care for yourself
just as much as you care for your
boyfriend your sister your best friend
you know what I mean and I also realize
it's hard to love someone when you don't
love yourself I think it's harder to
care for someone when you don't care for
yourself because you just and you're not
in practice and it I don't know I don't
know what I'm saying I just hope that
makes sense so before this video is
literally an hour long because I've been
filming for a minute and I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and if you did make
sure to give it a big thumbs up and
