it's me Mel so if you cannot tell we
have a little bit of a setup change and
also my chair is like rotating me red
sorry so if you guys didn't know I'm
kind of redoing my room I finished this
area of my room and I'm so excited for
it it's going to be my new setup I like
it a lot better than just sitting on my
bed I feel like the vibe is just I know
I like it so let me know if you guys
like this setup or not hope you do
because I also don't know if I'm focused
I tried manual focus today I usually use
automatic focus but if the set in focus
then we learn my lesson
today's video is going to be the 25
questions that nobody asks tag I feel
like I haven't done a lot of videos
where you guys can get to know me more I
guess like tags and stuff I want you
guys to just kind of get to know me
better if you like we're friends you
know me and all that stuff if you guys
liked seeing tags like this let me know
and I can definitely do more I have them
on my computadora you know let's just
get started do you sleep with your
closet doors open or closed they've got
to be closed especially since half of my
room is like near but it's like my
closet so if that's open I just can't
stop looking at it
I'll just see darkness and then I'll get
freaked out of it I cook for them and
they're like no so no it needs to be
closed you take shampoo and conditioner
bottles from the hotels ah yeah a huge
tub in my hallway so my family is known
to do that my mom mostly and by the way
if you see this band-aid it's because I
got stitches cuz I cut myself while
building this furniture for my room but
we're good
first time getting stitches I just got
to it wasn't like my finger fell off
yeah if you see this band-aid that's why
number three is you sleep with the
sheets tucked in or out I think when I
go to bed
they'll be tucked in and then throughout
the week I just will stop caring and it
all on tough when I sleep sometimes I
feel like I'm really restless sleeper
and I don't know why but I'll wake up
and my covers will be everywhere and I
was like whoa
what happened so I guess out mostly
because then I can like rot myself like
in them and I just like feel cozier I
don't know
hello have you ever stolen a straight
sign no I also don't know what I'd do
with that like if I just like solace
topside I feel like you would add an
artsy effect to your room but no do you
like to use post-it notes I do prefer it
on my computer like the stickies app or
whatever just cuz I feel like I would
lose time for the sticky notes but I do
write a lot of stuff down like to do or
like planning out a video but I usually
don't put on post-it notes I'll put it
in a notebook
come on my notebook it's all the way
over there ah like this this is my note
I keep all of my things I have to do do
cut out coupons but never use them yeah
probably like two dollars off your next
purchase and like ah score so I'll keep
it I'll be going through my wallet like
two months later and I'll see them and I
was like oh sweet and then I look at the
expiration date and it's expired so I'm
just like that's pointless so I feel
like I do cut out coupons or like stain
my coupons and then I don't end up using
them just cuz I forget so I would rather
be attacked by a bear or swarm of bees
I'm gonna slay a bear cuz it's less to
run from or I could just try to be
friendly with the babies there's gonna
be so many of them I've only got song
baby once and I did not like it and I
don't think getting stung by a ton of
them would be a lot of fun so I'm gonna
go with the bear I've always liked jump
on its back or something I just try to
go over the ideas but I'm gonna go with
the bear number eight is do you have
freckles and I actually do have freckles
can't really see them when I wear a full
face of makeup but when I don't have
makeup on or when I wear like a little
bit you can see them I have a lot on my
nose and then some right here but yeah
do you always smile for photos I think I
actually mostly do I mean I wish I could
work the Kylie Jenner smiles like but
what I'm taking group photos okay be
like hey I think a 10 inch file you know
I don't know
but first selfies no and then for like
group photos with a lot of people yeah
what is your biggest pet peeve my
biggest pet peeve is when people ignore
me I know it's on so bad I'm a Leo if
any of your
those Leos are supposed to hate when
people ignore them and I do especially
when is someone I'm really close to and
then they'll ignore me and not give me a
reason and I'll just like not talking
like what did I do
like come on at least tell me it just it
makes me think hello
like what could I've done like why are
they mad like what I'm like can you just
be straight up be straight up that's
definitely a pet peeve when someone
ignores me and doesn't tell me why or
when people are like hypocrites they'll
be like gosh I hate when someone does
this and then I'll do it like 10 M so
they're like yeah but definitely
ignoring one is probably my biggest pet
peeve gonna be on it do you count your
steps when you walk not really like when
I'm just walking around I make one too
but sometimes when I like go upstairs
and I like by myself and have nothing
but I'm doing ads like 2 4 6 4 1 2 like
I don't know not usually no have you
ever peed in the woods yeah a lot
actually because in seventh grade I went
on a trip to Yosemite and we were there
for a week hiking left 8 miles a day
there were no bathrooms in the middle of
Yosemite so that answers that question
oh no they were pooped in the woods I'm
just gonna leave it at I was in Yosemite
for a week and we're just gonna leave it
at that
never dance when there's no music
playing put duh yes I do
I know just like jealous think of a song
it's not like I like actually start
dancing make a whole like choreography
and stuff I like do little move for fun
you know it's that way ever done yes
give it you on your pens and pencils not
really think there's been a couple times
where I would be working and then I'll
just end up doing a big stop that's
gross there's a lot of
it's not like my habit like I know a lot
of people of habits my habit I'm that
person that gets the little clicky thing
and goats like this over and over again
and I catch myself doing on my stocks
like everyone's probably really annoyed
with me right now if anything that would
be my little habit not chewing on
how many people have you slept with this
week uh zero except for my dog like in
the same bed like he slept next week
he's actually sleeps on my feet because
he is antisocial and doesn't like to
cuddle but you know whatever but yeah no
zero
what size is your bed I actually have a
twin size mattress I wanted a queen but
I've had this too and my whole life you
know it leaves more room for the rest of
the stuff in my room my bed what is your
song of the week that's a hard question
let's see let's look
Oh shout out if you want to follow my
Spotify it's me myself in males to ELLs
that's where you can see all the music
going on I've been really liking this
song a lot of people are like no this is
a bad song I mean come on it's fine it's
body by jay-z and Jeremiah it just gets
me to get sued I listen to it on my way
to school every morning
when I Drive just cuz it pipes me up and
then I'm ready for the school day like
if I listen to sad music in the morning
I'm gonna fall back to sleep is it okay
for guys to wear pink duh yeah I mean a
color is not meant for one gender it's
not like alright this color isn't for
them this holiday for the like no the
whole rainbow was made for everyone so

it and I just kind of watch Netflix and
YouTube what's your least favorite movie

friend invited me to go see Vampires
Suck
I was like twelve ten or whatever I
don't know I was young and the movie
started and there was like all this gore
booms like gross and trying to be funny
blood would just spread out and there'd
be things on people's like I was
disgusted I had to leave the theater and
I asked my parents come pick me up
that's kind of been the only
that I really do not like I'm like
better with gÃ¶ran stuff now I'm better

number 22 where'd you bury hidden
treasure if you had some that's a really
hard question in this street who is
gonna think it's down under the pavement
no one I don't know I really don't know
number 23 what do you drink with dinner
I pick water I used to drink more sodas
and juices and things like that but I
have tried to be healthier and drink
more water because I should not drink

a lot of it but I drink water with my
meals now what do you dip a chicken
nugget in boo okay I know a couple ways
you could ketchup the sweet and sour
sauce my friends feel like barbecue

think that's what I would get to dip it
in
