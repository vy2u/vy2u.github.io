are you guys if you do not know who
you're looking at right now it's go it's
a girl
what's the reason I'm saying that if you
cannot tell your girl got her hair back
to brunette I have been changing my hair
color for a minute now and I think I'm
just going to let it be because this is
like more permanent than like the blonde
cuz I had to get it touched up literally
every two weeks it was taking a chunk
out of my big Styles not with it it was
so much upkeep with the blonde and it
didn't even look like my natural blonde
which is what I wanted I like wanted my
original hair back if you're wondering
what they did because I tell you guys
every time just in case you want to know
if they put low lights in my hair for
the darkness and then left some of the
blondes like highlights so it adds
dimension and shape yeah I hope you guys
liked it and I can go to my channel
hello my name is Mel what is up how are
you I hope you're good you already know
I would appreciate it if you would
subscribe and I have faith you know what
that means but anyways today's video is
going to be a back-to-school video I've
only done one of these this year so I'm
lagging but it's because I've been
moving and I've been so overwhelmed and
stressed and I've had so much to do I
was hoping to get at least a couple more
back to school videos up and I don't
know because it's back to school already
people are already in school I'm late
I'm late but you can wear any of these
looks any time of the year it doesn't
have to be just for back-to-school you
know it on me but yeah pretty much in
this video I show you guys three looks I
was going to do way more than three I'll
show your three looks but each look is
different in their own way so if you
want to wear less make it to school or
more make it to school or like a medium
amount like whatever hopefully this
would give you some inspiration because
it has kind of like three different
levels and really trying to switch up my
looks like later in my videos so now
that I did three today like I'm just
trying to like warm up myself to like
really starting to make like new looks
I know listeners aren't like completely
different but it's because I'm trying to
keep it natural for back-to-school also
quick disclaimer before I get into this
video I want you guys to know that you
do not eat makeup to go to school you
just you don't you should really go if
you want to and you feel comfortable
like that and whatever then go for it
like do what you want these are just
some ideas to hopefully inspire you for
what
when I do for back-to-school you know so
yeah before I ramble and rant too much
like always let's just get on into the
three look I'll do it let's do it so the
first thing I am doing of course is
primer this is the true blend primer
from covergirl in combo oily and dry
skin and I'm actually obsessed with this
then I took my trusty BB cream from
Maybelline and this is me realizing I
needed more than I put on my hand
anyways yeah this is also one of my
favorite things I've been using this
since I was literally in middle school
but this is the new like pomegranate
infused one and I just use this because
I feel like it would be lighter and
better for everyday wear for school for
me since I have some acne scars and
stuff like this it doesn't look the best
on my skin but you know you got to work
with what you got so yeah I just think
this look is like super perfect for like
just a lighter day you know now I'm just
putting on a little bit of concealer
this is the age rewind concealer from
Maybelline one of my favorites and I'm
just putting that wherever I want
brightened or a little bit more covered
all that good stuff and then I'm just
blending it out so it matches the
foundation a little more or the BB cream
not a foundationist and then I went in
with my setting powder from our CMA and
I just set my whole face and then I'm
taking my revlon colorstay cream
eyeshadow I love this stuff it went on
so nicely I just I don't know I think it
added a lot to the look by just doing
one easy simple step then I'm taking one
of my all-time favorite mascaras it's
new but I've been using it everyday
since I got it um this is the L'Oreal
mascara and it's lash paradise I believe
and it's just so good guys i 100%
recommend it to anyone I just did a
couple of coats on you know my bottom in
my top lashes and then I'm taking this
brow pencil spoolie type of thing and
I'm just brushing through my brows
because I thought I would keep it
natural and not do my brows for this
look and then I'm just finishing off the
look with some Vaseline and this kind of
nudish lipstick that I really really
like I'll have everything down below for
you guys just because I'm trying to go
through this a little fast and then I'm
taking my strobing stick from Maybelline
this is a highlighter it's so pretty so
dewy and also very natural so I just put
it on my nose my Cupid's bow on my
cheekbones and I think this added a lot
to the look very dewy glowy match
but like time to put together you know
what I'm saying then we're on to the
second look let's do this let's kill it
I'm just using the same primer because I
loved it so much and I didn't think I
needed to use a different primers so
yeah and then I'm taking my fit me a
foundation from Maybelline this is one
of my like I'm not kidding when I say
this I use this almost on the daily when
I'm out of like other stuff but I have
enough for a while so this is literally
been my go-to every day it's so
buildable and like just so easy to work
with I'm obsessed with it so yeah I just
put some concealer on my eyes set my
concealer and then moving on to the eye
shadow I'm taking this light brown color
in this Maybelline palette and I'm just
putting this through my crease just to
add some dimension to my eyes you know
not do too much but I think this adds a
lot just on any day basis just doing
this this is what my favorite steps and
then after I'm done blending that just
so there's no harsh lines or anything
like that I'm going to go in with some
setting spray and then take this light
champagne E and Lal outs trying this get
rid of setting spray because it's
getting on my couch oh but yeah I'm just
taking this light champagne e color and
I'm just putting that on the inner V of
my eye and kind of blending it on to my
lid just to make me look more waist and
then I'm taking this lighter brown and
I'm kind of putting it between the
darker you know crease color and the
lighter lid color I guess so pretty much
I'm using this to just blend all the
eyeshadows and make it more like a
gradual transition from the interviewee
to the outer V if that makes sense so
yeah now going in with the skinny
eyeliner from maybelline this is awesome
for precision and stuff like that I'm
just putting that on my top lash line
and also on my bottom lash line just
actually tight line I'm so sorry it's
tight line home just to add you know
some darkness into the eye some mystery
Nova Friel I really think that helps
your eyes pop sometimes it's not my
everyday type of thing but I like it
occasionally so then of course I'm just
going in with the same mascara because
it's so good I just I just have to use
it and I'm just putting that on my top
lashes and then I'm taking the covergirl
clump crusher mascara and I'm just
putting that on my top lashes to get rid
of those clumps V and now I'm just
taking the same brown eyeshadow that I
put in my crease and I'm putting that on
my lower lash line I love this step I
always do this I just
I think it adds so much I'm going to be
honest and then I'm taking the same
mascara and just putting that on my
lower lashes to finish up the eyes and
then I'm taking my big powder brush and
the same setting powder I used before
and putting that all over my face I also
didn't use concealer on this look
because I thought it was kind of cool
that like you know there's different
looks you don't have to use concealer
every day I don't have to use a certain
product every day and I think this
looked really good with that concealer
so yeah then I'm filling in my eyebrows
a little bit with this isn't Maybelline
I think it's Maybelline everything will
be linked down below but yeah I just
filled them in a little bit in the
sparse areas and then I'm taking this
Rimmel London bronzer I love this this
was very pretty and it has three
different shades which I actually ended
up using like contouring different parts
of my face with different shades so I
thought that was really cool
so then I'm just doing a little bit of
nose contour not too crazy we're trying
to keep it natural but I just love nose
contour I had to include it I am taking
this highlighter from Physicians Formula
there we go and let me just say wait
hold up listen oh that was a real react
Holi I'm glowing so I forgot how amazing
these highlighters were holy hell I
owned them when I was younger but
highlighter wasn't even a thing back
then so yeah as you can tell that was a
killer highlighter I'm just it's amazing
so I'm taking this setting spray from
L'Oreal just to finish off the look that
is the second look and this is one of my
favorites because I think it's like
super put together but also like kind of
cute and natural I don't know I really
like it so then moving on to the third
and the last look this is the most
intense one the most makeup out of all
the looks so I'm just using the same
primer on my face of course and then
going in with the same strobing
highlighter stick and I'm just putting
that on before my foundation to get some
glow you know I'm trying to go with thin
as well not just on top
what did not make sense I'm sorry so
anyways as I was saying that I'm using
the same foundation the fit me
foundation but I'm putting a little bit
more than I did last time just for more
coverage then I'm taking the same
concealer doing the same step where I
set my eyes I prepped my eyes all that
good stuff
of and then let's move on to the eye
shadow I'm just going to take the same
palette as I had before and I'm just
using the like nudish you know white
toned eyeshadow to cancel out any of my
veins any redness all that good stuff so
then I'm taking a darker toned brown
color for my crease and I just put this
in my crease like I've been doing but
it's just darker so it's a little more
dramatic and then I'm taking this color
as well because I wanted more of like a
warm toned eyeshadow the other one was
looking a little cool toned on my eyes
so I use this one and I loved it and
that palette was from covergirl by the
way but now back to the Maybelline
palette I'm just taking this more warm
toned champagne almost like a rose gold
kind of and I just put that on my lid
and then I'm taking the same champagne
color I used before and I just put that
in my inner V and also blended that with
the rose gold is color and then I'm
taking this darker Brown from the
covergirl palette and focusing that into
the outer V but also trying to make it
kind of like a wing shape you feel me
kind of I don't know we just focus that
into the crease and outer V to add a lot
of dimension to our eyes you know
because we're going for it and then I'm
taking this copper eyeliner from
Physicians Formula this was nice but it
wasn't as like dark and pigmented as I
thought it was going to be but it still
looked really good with the look I think
it actually blended super nicely with
the eyeshadow color it's all the colors
on the eye together I think worked super
well so I was happy with it and then
once we're done with that we're just
going to put a little bit of concealer
on to brighten up below and then I'm
just blending that out with my concealer
brush just to make it look flawless and
I'm also really trying to exact that
wing if that makes any sense I'm trying
to define the wing here because that's
where you like clean it up concealer
cleans up your wing life AG it's the
best so once I'm done blending all the
concealer on my face I'm just going to
move on my camera died so I did my brows
and my mascara which I used the same
product for so I didn't think I would
need to show it and now I'm just taking
the same dark brown color from the
covergirl palette and putting that on my
lower lash line so then to finish up the
look I'm just taking my covergirl clump
crusher mascara and putting that on my
bottom lashes so then I'm just moving on
to bronzer I use the same Rimmel London
bronzer and just bronze everywhere the
jaw line the cheekbones the forehead and
of course the nose I didn't actually
include it but I bronze my nose later on
I forgot to do it until the end so then
I took miss blush from a Revlon this is
summers ship type of thing but it didn't
add a lot of highlighter to my face so
of course I went in with more the other
Physicians Formula one that I used
before and I'm losing my voice before
what is happening so then to finish off
the look after the cupids bow
highlighter of course I'm taking the
same lipstick and nude embrace and just
putting that on my lips I love this it's
one of my favorite lip colors I don't
love a lot of lip colors but I like this
one and I'm just putting some vaseline
on my lips to moisturize them and then
setting this look with the L'Oreal
setting spray and we're done we're done
with the third look I think this is the
most dramatic one I also really like it
and I hope you do too
