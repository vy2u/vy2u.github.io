headphones on because like my ears just
start hurting but they're the gold ones
I think they look so sick I'm honestly
jealous you guys will be winning these
bad boys and I hope you enjoy so then
the next thing that I think is really
exciting is a yellow kit but this is the
Sun dipti glow kit from Anastasia
Beverly Hills this is the new one and it
is beyond gorgeous actually I'm just
gonna open it I'm sorry I'm not touching
it in any way okay well I am but like

use a blue palette of this but this is a
new one but please tell me how this is
cuz I might have to get one too umm but
yeah so you'll be winning this so then
the next thing you guys will be winning
is a full-size of the better than sex
waterproof mascara because I recently
started using this and it is so bomb
it's probably one of my favorite
mascaras and so I had to get it for you

know the waterproof one is like fairly
new yeah I picked you guys up this tell
me how you like it and I like turn
burnished right so the next thing is the

best primer out there so that's why I
got it the next thing is really cute
it's this little kit from benefit it's
the best tips for ever it comes with a
better ball a cha-cha bomb a Benetint
and a cha-cha tint I think they're no

synthetic kabuki brushes collections oh
yeah so then the next thing is this
Urban Decay all nighter makeup setting
spray but I bought you like the travel
size
just because and I got mine I got the
big one but then I have wish I got the
smaller one because it's just so much
more convenient to like put in your bag
and bring around and if you're traveling
cuz you can't bring the other one so
that's why I got this size I just feel
like it's better for on-the-go and
things like that and it's actually still
a pretty big like products but it's
travel friendly but then the next thing
is this NYX palette so it has a
highlighter a blush and a bronzer but it
also has six eyeshadows and the
eyeshadows are boar Geist rose gold II
but then a little purpley and like gold
it's just super pretty so I got you guys
this palette and if you're wondering it
is in wanderlust it's all I got on the
go palette which is pretty cool because
it has like everything you need ya know
and another thing is just this benefit
bag that came with the other benefit
stuff but it's laughter is the best
cosmetic little carrying case I think
that's super cute then the next thing
from benefit is this Bravo conditioning
primer nutrient-rich primer for fuller
looking brows which i think is really
cool I've never used this you guys know
that I don't fill in my eyebrows just
because when I do it's just a little too
crazy a little too much going on and if
you don't believe me i snapchat it
before I just take off you guys have
seen without makeup like why do people
think I'm lying about my eyebrows so I
hope you guys enjoy this and then the
next thing I got you is my go-to
favorite liquid eyeliner a lot of you
