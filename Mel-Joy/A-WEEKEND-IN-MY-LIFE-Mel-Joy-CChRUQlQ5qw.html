back at it
vlogging I don't remember the last time
I looked I decided I wanted to do a vlog
this week my life is actually super
chill um I don't know I live in the bay
if you guys don't know a lot of people
think I live in LA but I don't I don't I
feel like I don't blog and show you guys
what I do every day that much so this
what we're doing for an everyday type of
thing I barely wear makeup I'm just
I usually just wear mascara and put some
brow product and Jessica's makeup takes
time and effort and I'm just gonna keep
you guys updated as my day goes on and
show you what I do I'm not doing
anything for this vlog like for this
vlog like everything I'm doing today
I was actually gonna do today so you're
gonna make me break out fun fact I'm
allergic to his saliva kind of even
though you're hypoallergenic so I still
have to wash my face after he likes me
because he looks constantly and I'm not
focused what's that boys have a kiss
thank you thank you
dogs are just the most precious things
in the whole world not plan you want to
get loving I know you want loving but
you gotta plan shit this son he wants to
go play where you're living this is why
I come to my parents house well I mean
my parents aren't home right now I would
be here to say hi to my parents too but
they're golfing so I'm here to say hi to
my baby boy and hang out with him a
little bit I just wanted to see him I
missed him and they have free food here
because when you're living on your own
you don't realize how hard it is to make
every meal you know parents they do a
lot for you they really do like my
outfit you like my fed what they give me
attention oh oh ha ha ha you meet my dog
like you don't understand how precious
he is
it's just one big one big ball of love
just one thing oh he says I know I am I
know also when he whines he's not like
in pain that's him being like grab me
more read me more that's like how he
talks it's the cutest thing kind of oh
my god white acting so cute on camera
you little performer are you little
entertainer he's an animal

cute cheese oh my god lucky I'm for real
gonna break out so bad
lucky you like my beanie what you gonna
wear my beanie my face you see you know
I know him ten minutes of footage of me
petting my dog if any of you have a dog
you're allergic to you can relate to the
fact that you have to wash your hands a
wash your goddamn face and order to not
break up one of the reasons I love to
come to my parents house lucky are you
doing his business I love being outside
I just want a big backyard but things
are happening so stay tuned I just like
to come sit out here and chill listen to
music they got rid of all the furniture

Hanukkah then happy belated Chanukah
dude I hope it was a good one I just got
back from my parents house I was there
because my sister came down to see us
and have Christmas or Christmas Eve
dinner
it was so chill we just watched TV and
got takeout from Chinese so we don't
have like a lot of family or anything so
we don't have like big things I wish I
could go to stuff like that that'd be
dope whenever I go to my friends like
big family gatherings it's always so
sick not back at my apartment and I'm
just about an edit I want to get this
video up done whatever because I take so
long with my videos I'm is so tired I
don't know why I didn't even do that
much is that like that's just me all the
time I wanted to make a little outro to
say what's up really quickly and also
just to say that this was like a weekend
in my life I feel like because I was
gonna say day in my life and then I made
it more like weekend and I just flogged
at random times I want to do like more
capturing my life instead of like hey
what's up you know I don't I don't know
if that makes sense
uh-hum so just vlog at random times
whenever I feel like it's flog worthy
and I feel like a lot of my moments
aren't because me and my friends just do
really chill stuff and if I'm alone I'm
also just doing really chill stuff and
sitting on the couch and editing or
doing something like that school just
school this is just like a little
weekend in my life I guess I did want to
let you guys know that I am moving very
soon and I'm so excited I can't believe
this place is about
be mine such an upgrade from this place
but it's not breaking the bank or
anything like that my apartment is just
way too small for me and my stuff and
for the amount I'm here I just feel like
I have cabin fever all the time and it's
just not I don't I don't know like I'm
gonna talk more about it in my blogs and
stuff like that I can't wait for you
guys to see the place I'm obsessed I'm
actually gonna be doing moving drugs at
this time because the first time I moved
I just I tried I filmed them like I did
I didn't upload them and I just long
story short I sucked and moving drugs

gonna do good ones so stay tuned if you
want to subscribe to my vlog channel
link down below actually for real let me
know if you guys would want the moving
vlogs on my blog channel or on my main
channel because I feel like it would be
like spam or I could make them really
long and like mush them together and
make it like weeks
I don't know please let me know down
below what you guys would want to see
because I feel like there's so many
different things I could do I'm gonna go
