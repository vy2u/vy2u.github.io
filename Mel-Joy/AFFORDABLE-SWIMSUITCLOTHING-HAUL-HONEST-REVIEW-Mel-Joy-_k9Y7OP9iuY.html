posture I feel you're quite a different
person and every single in my videos
because of my hair I'm all over this
place bro hello my beautiful best friend
really quickly before I continue into
the video I did get my hair dyed I know
a lot of you have been saying then it
looks orange and I've damaged it but I
got it fixed and it almost looks like my
old hair color it's a little more gray
but I like it I hope you like it too
also if you can't tell I'm in a new
background let me know if you like it or
not because I'm really trying to find
new backgrounds and rickroll is
struggling but that I'll try this one
out I've never actually thought about
filming you but I kind of like it so
we'll see and also if you need my
channel hey my name is Mel is great to
meet you what's good how are you if you
are new to my channel and you want to
see more of my videos every Saturday
then click the subscribe button down
below
totally okay so today's video is going
to be an affordable bikini slash a
couple pieces of clothing because I've
seen a lot a lot of these videos going
around YouTube right now
kind of like the Affordable bikini
Paul's I don't want to sound shady in
any way shape or form like at all
towards anyone or any brand but the
brand that is mostly included in these
is that full sample calm and yet I was
offered to be sponsored by them to do
like an affordable bikini hauls but I
know a lot of people like do these
videos and they are sponsors so they
don't want to like hate on them so what
I did is I ordered them all with my own
money as many I word quite a few I just
thought it'd be helpful for you guys if
you like my opinion totally unbiased you
feeling okay let's go search I don't
know what I want to start with so a lot
of these bikinis don't like fit me super
well or whatever so I don't know if this
is going to be try out or not
there might be like try on for some
pieces you know what I mean yeah so I'm
going to do one pieces first and I'll
have all the sizing and prices right
here just because I don't really know
off the top of my head so I'll be right
here I haven't seen these go around like
crazy like on social media and whatever
like this is a swimsuit to have it's
just like white and then it's really
really low-cut so you got like some
sideboob going on you feel me the front
is like pretty low-cut - I don't have
the biggest breasts this is so I feel
like it'd be better with someone's like
chess just because this part out falls
down on me if you go and sing I don't
know I really like it other than that I
just would feel kind of scared to wear
it because it would like slip off and
show my stuff so one thing I don't love
about this bikini is you see these like
pads like I'm really happy this is not a
bikini this is a one-piece I like how
there's pads in it I don't thinks how
you can tell off-camera but it's like
almost shadowed because this part is
thicker then this part down here so like
when you put it on you see like a line
do you think oh I hope that makes sense
it's pretty good material just really
sit I have a slight suspicion that if
you get this wet it'll become really
really really see-through so we'll see
and then the next one piece I don't
remember ordering but it's okay I
accidentally ordered like a lot of
doubles because I forgotten that I
ordered a ton I'm all over this place
bro let's open this bad boy uh okay so
what I really like about this swimsuit
is that it's velvet it's like you know
what I'm going to branch out and give
Elvis jumpsuit I got like three actually
so this one is like a one-piece I
actually like this a good amount I like
it it has like mesh right here on the
sides let me see if I can show you it
looks like this
oh oh yeah you can kind of tell another
is mashing right here what I do like
about the stressor just erupt what I do
like is that the straps are adjustable
can barely any of the other sim suits
are adjustable so that's like super dope
and I really like that in the butt is a
little cheeky not too cheeky but like
it's a good in-between I like it I might
actually end up wearing it as like a one
piece for under like jeans because you
could you literally could I actually
think that's all the one pieces I have I
ordered a black one too but it hasn't
coming out because some take like a week
to get here and it's super cool and then
some take like a lot of weeks it just
depends like the swimsuit so make sure
if you want it soon when you buy it like
at the bottom of the swimsuit it will
say like shifts in like one two days are
like ships in two to four weeks and I
didn't realize that until after I
ordered this stuff so this next swimsuit
is also velvet so these are the bottoms
they look like this they're like
high-rise and I like these but they're a
little loose on me up here so I don't
love that because it's not super
form-fitting and then the top I should
really like the top I feel like I'm
going to wear this a lot as like a shirt
in the summer it's like a black velvet
tube top and it's actually really cute
and I really really
I guess so I might just wear this with
like different bottoms so this is the
first two-piece and I actually would
recommend this and then the next one
soon I actually I actually really like
this so the fabric is a little
noticeably cheap I don't know it's hard
to explain but then these are the
bottoms I actually like these bottoms
what amount I feel like I'm being mean
and criticizing but also it's like these
are really really cheap they're like ten
dollars so you can't complain
but I actually like this one it's cute
it's cute I think I'm going to wear that
role in the summer I just really like
the color and like the style is kind of
like tomboy I'm into it
so then this bathing suit is definitely
a do for an expensive one I'm not sure
which one it is I kind of want to do a
style of video we're like I take a
bathing suit like this ten dollars and
then one that looks just like it that's
like really expensive and compare them
because I've seen a lot of those I'm
actually really helpful so if you want
to see that comment down below and like
this video so I know what but I actually
really like this one suit but it's a
little big for me sadly I'm like I gotta
sit up yes posture breath like a royal
blue and then that has this like mesh
not mesh like quilted fabric I don't
know it's sometimes fabric on it and
then the bottoms are like that - I like
the but what I don't love about the
front is like it's really big it does
that make sense so I just feel like it's
like really wide on me and like I'm not
super flattering but I still like the
idea of it it's really cute and I like
the colors a lot so now I got this
bathing suit and I wasn't expecting it
to be this bright but it's not like ugly
like it's so cute it's like braided it
has braids here and the braids in the
back and the bottoms have like braids
and then this little slope things like
little stretched right by your crotch
and then the butt is like roush so these
are actually pretty cute I don't think
they set me amazingly or the descendants
in amazement it's one of these it
secured swimsuits actually pretty good
quality I would think that this one's
actually better quality than some of the
other ones that I ordered so if you like
this color and you like this style go
forward Beach so then I got this white
bathing suit and I was so so so excited
for this bathing suit I just really like
white bathing suits and I thought this
was super cute the bottoms look like
this and the bottoms actually fit me
like pretty well and the butt looks like
this a little more cheeky I'm trying to
get a tan you feel
I like these straps because you can kind
of like position them like lower on your
hips or like higher above
kind of want to like hide your love
handles you feel the top is that I'm
disappointed about I'm actually really
sad because I really like this it's just
white and then it looks like this and
supposedly like just triangle but it has
like thicker fabric around so it almost
looks like a triangle like some suit
like that style but like all one color
and I really like it when you put it on
it's like pretty Caesar so you can see
the pads I would just imagine it would
get worse in water if you know arms then
you can't really see it on camera which
is why I'm not like trying everything on
it's like when you put it on it like
kind of stretches out so you can like
see the parts it's like around the pad
and then you still see the pad so I'm
not going to wear this probably unless I
take out the pads and just go
free-for-all so no I like the bottom of
them the top of not I'm not happy about
but okay okay so this is actually when
my favorite sub suits I ordered because
it's actually really good quality I like
the color I like the fabric everything
like that stay pretty cheeky like a
light blush pink color and then the top
kind of looks like the triangle some
suits I don't know some kind of Sykes
little triangle face just the same color
and then has like the little seam which
is what reminds me of the triangles and
what I really liked about this too is
you can make it racerback
for around the neck if you want to tie
it or like the sides if you just want
like a broad you know what I mean just
like over the shoulder yeah I like this
this is cute this is a success so this
bathing suit was not a success but I
really liked it honestly I'll probably
reorder this one just because the girl
likes it so it just looks like this it's
just black and then has like the gold
little circles and then it's like
crossover whatever I'm super bad at
explaining stuff but it's so cute Draya
saw this and she was like that is you in
a bikini like that if you and I like to
play it but I don't know I really like
it but it's way too small on me it's
funny how like some small fit and then
some don't so I think I might have to
get a medium in this because the bottoms
are also way too small and literally
don't cover my butt they just they don't
so I really like this bathing too but it
didn't fit so that's kind of
disappointing but I can tell you right
here that the seams are like ripping out
as we speak so systems to them the next
waving suit is this velvet one and I had
high hopes for this bathing suit I had
high hopes I actually think I ordered
two of these by accident but like from
different places they've like different
sellers I think online this one looks
like army green new to the bottoms
pretty freakin cheeky oh wait I'm just
kidding
that cheeky like for screen it's like
bright green like bright dark green if
you know I'm saying I don't know I
thought this was going to be more like
army green still actually kind of cute
trying it on and the second one I
ordered might be army green
let's hope but I would actually suggest
these because they're pretty good
quality soft and cute the bottoms a
little weird fitted but it's okay it's
okay so then the next so suit is this
white one so this is the bottom this
doesn't really fit me I feel like some
of them are just like too why but I just
like bunch up and look awkward I don't
know if the fabrics cool it's like lined
kind of kind of fake which is nice so
we'll see if I can end up wearing that
but the top looks like this again with
the kind of sports bra looking thing
this one has adjustable straps which I
love that's just so nice and just
helpful it's really cute it's just like
tied up right here and the only thing
about this is when you put it on the
pads are a little smaller than the
actual fabric so it like bunches up a
lot and like looks a little awkward and
loose so it's like not my favorite
favorite thing I'm not sure if I'm going
to wear it yet but we'll see so then I
got this bathing suit and I actually
really like these bottoms I'm going to
wear these bottoms I can just tell so
much in the summer because they're just
the basic black bottoms you guys know
that lots of my favorite colors and then
there's these straps right here that go
like right above the sand suit there we
go there we go so I think it looks like
really cute if you put this near your
love handles and above it it might sink
away from them so I'm so excited for
this and then the top is a little small
and like the straps are a little long
that's why I like it's just so nice to
have adjustable straps and a lot of them
don't but this one's just black scoop
neck really small like with coats and
that is and then the next waiting to it
has these like palm leaves I think it's
such a cute sign so the top looks like
this I like the top a lot the bottom is
a little weird fitting I don't know but
they're cute I like the top I'll
probably the top it's like the black
strappy bottoms that'd be sick I'm into
that so that was all the bathing suits
that I ordered my honest review about
the bathing suits is like it's really a
hit or miss depending on which swimsuit
you get which is like a little risky to
me I mean they're really cheap so if you
like buy one it's not the biggest deal
if you don't like it you know if you buy
like a triangle swimsuit for a hundred
dollars and you don't like it you're
like huh okay
so if you buy this it's like just a
little less guilt
we're gonna have feel like it so it's
just not super consistent and I love
consistency like be consistent with me
always and I will love you forever so
that's just the only thing but I did get
a few clothing pieces which I do really
want to talk about because there are
some hits and there are some misses but
like weird misses you'll see so the
first thing is a satin tank top in red I
actually think this is super cute it's
not like the best like cut or like
sewing I feel like that's kind like the
style just kind of like Messier and then
the next thing I think might be a Miss
I'm not sure it's this tank top but it's
like a light baby pink color I thought
it's going to be like a little lighter
actual it's really light on camera but
in person it's like pretty pink I just
feel like I can't pull off this color
super well I don't know I don't know but
I do like it it's just like a basic
velvet tank top so like this in my black
would have been really cute but I was
like I'm going to branch out and get a
color I ordered this in a small and it
came in a medium the name is brandy
Mayer the Lord like brandy melville
that's really funny it's not bad it's
like it's comfortable
maybe's just the color on me I don't
like so then the next shop I ordered I
actually love I wore it on a photo shoot
if you want to be my Instagram it's on
there but it looks like the Ru of my
cropped shirt there we go um the black
event has little sleeves here it fits
really nicely it feels really nice like
good quality so I would definitely say
this is a hit compared to like spending
so much money for the are you in my life
so then I got the same one like this but
it's like really cropped here and in the
long sleeve and I like this a lot too
it's just like the Arnie on my one and
if I'm talking really fast because my
battery's been back so and this is
definitely a Miss because it's really
different on the website like on if you
tell but it's like it has sparkles in it
if it didn't that sparkles I would like
it better it's just really sparkly
little dress cover-up type of thing but
if you're in sparkles
you'll be nervous so then this confuses
me this just confuses me I got these
shorts right and they're pretty cute
like trying them on I like them but when
you go to button them there's no hole
and can you see that there's literally
no hole like they forgot to like cut the
hole to put the button I guess I'm just
gonna have to like cut it myself or
something but I mean they're cute but
it's like who forgets to sew the button
think this was a Miss because I got
these shorts and I thought they're going
to look like the brain
melons and they kind of do but I feel
like they're almost like smaller because
when I put them on this grips my leg
like grips like it looks like bike
shorts like that's how tight it is and
it's just really not a cute look
especially with the ruffles like being
really tight on your leg
it's not my favorite so my camera's
gonna die and I believe I'm actually out
of things to show you
so overall I like mosa or some of the
stuff I got I don't wanna like complain
it's really cheap it's pretty good if
you're looking for affordable swimsuits
in the summer I would tell you that I
have to say that so yeah if you want to
see more videos like this let me know it
down below and I can definitely do that
for you guys if you like this video give
it a thumbs up and comment down below
what your favorite swimsuit shop is I
don't know I love some suits so I'm
excited for summer but I love you guys
to infinity and beyond I mean it when I
say it and I hope you know that and my
trimmer is literally about to die but I
will hopefully see you in my next video
