least once
nope once a month because Q aids are
literally one of my favorite favorite
favorite videos - so you sent us an
acute a before breast like it's kind of
good dying off YouTube but they will
never die off my channel because it
gives me a way to talk to you guys every
month but I mean like I'm literally like
talking you guys 24/7 on my Twitter and
Instagram and stuff like that but I mean
ya know in a video what if you haven't
seen one of my Q names before and you're
like I know my channel hello thank you
for joining our videos pretty awesome I
gotta admit but I wear a hoodie every
kid ninh so that's sort of a name I know
hood I don't really hurt my hands
because these studio lights generate a
lot of heat and also in my background
I'm in the middle of figuring out some
of the background so this is like very
very temporary I'm not even into it I
try to be ahead of the game on this QA
and I tweeted last night yes and I pick
to the question last night if you want
to follow my Twitter so you can be
featured in my Q&amp;amp;A it's Mel dot no smell
joy pretty simple at no Joey knows
things but I tweeted out to you guys and
I took screenshots of my favorite wine

two names honestly I missed what month
is it
I miss December probably cuz I was doing
blogging nice and I did two days on
there and stuff are you six minutes of
footage Who am I alright let's get
started oh man I have a lot of
screenshots oh you guys had a lot of
good questions I'm going to try to like
not rant for every single question like
I usually do I mean I'm me so I probably
will be like wearing try to keep it
concise at burrito melody asks what was
your initial reaction to hitting one
mill my initial reaction was not even a
reaction because I was like like this
has been happening right now I was so in
all and like it was so unreal to me and
I'm sitting in a hotel because I was in
LA and I was like what just happened I
was like no that's not my channel still
went on out my initial reaction was just
like this is unreal
not happening what is going on I don't
even know so thank you for 1 million if
you haven't seen my 1 million subscriber
giveaway last video my last video and I
gave away like a MacBook my last stuff
so you should just be an uncle look at
that if you want to earn some cool
prizes yet it will be linked down below
share citroen asked to do you love me
yes I do
so adoring Lex asks do you want more
pets I love you baby I love you too
I do want more pets when I move out
because I'm almost 18 and I would just
love to have a place of my own
oh my god I'm such a person that like
loves that a long time loves like all of
that so I bought that really really long
time I want to have like a little puppy
I feel like pets give me like a
relationship type of love just can't get
from from anyone else I'm very single to
like the dog would be nice but I have a
dog right now and I love him to pieces
but I mean like another one for when I
move you feel me adoring like grow
you're on a roll today with these
questions also asks any new merch or
jewelry I love you babe I love you and I
know you said that in your last question
I don't remember I haven't really
announced this I probably will have
announced this one piece of this video
but new merchant at what's not likely no
new merch looks like different colors so
like mine and my juices crops hoodie is
now in gray and I just added the other
like morning afternoon I would Ian gray
as well so now that has like the tan
color natural color and gray and black
and more stuff is coming I'm so excited
for some of the stuff that's coming out
and I visited where they make my merch
in LA and I got to like pick out like
color is my design and stuff so excited
because it's about a little go so stay
tuned for that but also if you want to
check out any of my other merch and the
new colors that just came out
it's video I flash Mel joy but it's
Capital m and capital J Madison of the
media I'm so sorry ass dude iron hair so
gorgeous I love you I love you too
and no actually don't dye my hair this
is literally just much chillin regular
hair color but I'm getting kind of sick
of it I'm going to be honest I've always
wanted to like dye my hair like brown or
highlights or like just do something
different to it because of when I had
this like my whole life like I've had
colors because I feel like everyone goes
to that middle school phase where they
have like a streak or like dyed tips or
I went purple for a little bit that was
a middle school months ago but I want to
like do something different naturally so
comment down below what I should do if I
should even do anything honestly might
not have the guts to but like I want to
hustle see how Kyle Kyle Kyle at having
asks are you planning on moving out soon
so this kind of like corresponds to like
the pet one because I talked about
moving out but I would I would like to
move that soon and I just visited Olivia
in LA and I stayed with her for a couple
days a thing that those are a little
longer coming out I'm so excited but I
love being in LA and I was being likes
her and other friends out there and
stuff but I love being you two as my
friends but it's like my dream would
probably be to like get a place in LA
when I turn 18 so I can go down my for
weeks at a time and I don't have to
stress about finding place to stay or
like paying for hotels and I can come
and live here at my house whenever I
want to if my parents will let me but
we're like best friends so appreciate
will oh I live in the Bay Area if you're
wondering I didn't really make that
clear it's like a six hour drive and
like an hour flight I love flying so
easy so lilac comments asks for when you
get in a relationship what you want it
to be based on like a quality okay this
is a really good question definitely on
hundred percent actually goal of you
guys already know this about me but like
loyalty and real minister because the
fake vibes are don't get me started
don't you mr. every today I always rant
about faking sand I'm not going to do it
this time I'm going to stop myself oh
definitely like real nice loyalty
trustworthy MS like mutual trust there
we go and like I don't know just like
real mix and just like being yourself
and just that's the dream that's the
truth and you guys out there that are
you know into that hit me up so purely
pour poured off ask how is being being
going so if you saw my a million
subscriber giveaway and you know that
invite to my funeral and you know that
oh my god
so I've been begin for about six months
no milk
now like almost seven months that's
crazy well and I've been really liking
it and everything like that
but one of the hardest things for me at
least being someone who loves makeup and
less fashion is the whole like not being
able to buy things that aren't like
vegan for example a product from a brand
that like tests on animals but a lot of
the brands that like say that they're
not these are the ones that test on
animals in China because it's mandatory
they're like required by law to check i
animals if you're sewing and China
China's like really big for selling
stuff so a lot of brands want to sell
there so they have to do that there but
here they don't test on animals and I
was doing really well I wasn't buying
any products for my places like that I
don't know it just got harder and harder
and also for my career as well like if I
ever want to do a makeup line with a
brand or like oh my god that'd be crazy
like I want to sell my spec up because I
am again I mean I can make it by like no
designer talking about a dog but I did
have an opportunity to work with several
brands that I have loved since I was a
little girl like oh my god it's just
crazy to think about working with them
but I wouldn't be able to work with em
if I were vegan because they're not
vegan friendly like in the end it's also
like what do you want to do in your life
and what are you like what do you feel
passionate about and actually sometimes
people tend to make decisions based on
like because they have a following and I
definitely do I feel like everyone does
this decision I already just wanted to
make on my own so right now I guess by
terms is like a plant-based diet so I
don't need any animal products I'm still
eating vegan I'm just like not fully
vegan when it comes to like make a
product and stuff so if you see any
tutorials where I like use non vegan
product that's why I'm sorry if you
really care that much about me being do
yet I don't I feel like it's my life my
decisions but thank you for those who
care a lot about it seaward of the vegan
thing takes me because I don't know if I
want to say begin for a while or not
because I don't know I only want to do
things when I feel my best and whatever
and
I start not doing my best or I don't
know I was kind of a rant but like we'll
see how it goes so we get at this point
food what I blame Kara Korra asks will
you follow me and yes girl I got you I'm
gonna go to my app right now I followed
you
so Julia underscore Cohan asked do you
begin to recognize your subscribers on
Twitter after well love you MA I love
you more and yes
hands down I know so many of you guys by
name I don't know like the more you
treat me the more I see like username I
know a lot of you guys by name now and I
love it and it makes me feel even closer
to you guys now is our joy oh my god you
guys are so cute ask can we make another
what's on my iPhone videos thank you got
a new one so if you didn't know I also
broke it was good that song is just
having lots of issues so I got a new
phone and it is the iPhone 7 plus in
black and I am obsessed with this thing
so far it's not even like that different
from my old phone cuz I have the 6s plus
you know I wasn't even needed to get
like an upgrade but just my phone broke
I was like why not the cameras show much
better I'm trying to you know stuff on
my Instagram feed you know say but yeah
I really like it doesn't even answer the
question yes I will do it what's on my
iPhone video if you guys want to see
that comment down below and like this
video and I can do that
for one of my next videos I'm so now so
XML Joyce Bobby she like I recognized
Bobby like I've seen I named ah Bobby
hey what's up I love you oh yes did you
make any New Year's resolutions I love
you but I said I love you I love you Wow
and yes I did kind of not like a set
thing but it was more like hey make this
year your year like do what you want do
what you love and I don't know don't
care what other people say if I really
like just do you and be proud about it
and love yourself and I really just want
to like make this your life not being
afraid to say what I want do what I want
not unlike those lability said whatever
way just really like live your life like
there's no tomorrow don't be afraid to
like stand up for yourself and don't be
afraid to tell people how you feel and
everything like that and just don't live
in fear yeah there we go that's a new
year's resolution don't let me fear you
just do what you want it's your life
live it
okay I really like this question so I'm
going to butcher your name cat
I'm sorry but I see mirror style ask do
you think that everything happens for a
reason
love you I love you too a really good
question I think as I grow up more and
experience many things and everything
like that I do I do think everything
happens for a reason there are things
that you do want to change in your life
that I get at least to me I think that
life is what you make it
so everything happens for a reason it's
kind of a mindset if something like that
happens like everything happens for a
reason it's like how can you grow from
it
it's like the mindset about everything
happens for a reason if that makes any
sense just to like move on and accept it
or honestly it's like everything else
freezing you can like just let your life
play itself out and love it or you can
really stand up for what you want and do
what you want and what you love and make
the most of it and I think it's kinda
like am i sensing area so that's three
times probably the more on but in a way
yet but I think it also really matters
how you impact your own life if that
makes anything so it's 28 minutes of
footage that's a really good time so I'm
going to end this video off thank you to
everyone who asked me a question I will
definitely be doing a Q&amp;amp;A I'm actually
doing a Q&amp;amp;A with Olivia in one of my
next videos those stages for that but I
will make sure to do at least one Q&amp;amp;A a
month I love you guys to infinity and
beyond I mean it when I say it and I
hope you know that and I hope that
you're having a marvelous morning
afternoon or night and I will hopefully
see you Alaric's video this is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
