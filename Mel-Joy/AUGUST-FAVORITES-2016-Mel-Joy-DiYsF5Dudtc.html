wearing these things like crazy I think
they're so so cute I'm obsessed I'm even
know I don't even know these have
definitely been my first favorite I just
can't get enough of these honestly oh oh
so the next favorite I might as well
just stick along the line of them
clothing this shirt it is a camo shirt
from Urban Outfitters outfit o--'s from
Urban Outfitters but it's not even just
the shirt it's just the print like I've
been sown a camo I love I don't know why
I just got became a like in the
summertime I've been wearing this shirt
a lot I've been wearing my Thrasher
sweatshirt I was going to show that it's
in the laundry right now I've actually
been getting a good amount of heat for a
wine flasher because I don't skate but
guys I'm just gonna like be real right
now
I got a penny board like the week they
came out so like og skater right here I
was like ask relay I still like the
sweatshirt I still think it's cute and a
lot of you guys were telling
you did too so I've definitely been
loving the print camera this is just a
shirt this is so comfortable by the way
I'm going I thought your sweatshirt
non-stop I think it's really funny when
you guys comment like well why are you
wearing your shirt in this video because
I'm wearing camo like it takes me second
than like I got you and if you want to
know what the Thrasher switcher looks
like I was wearing it in my QA my last
Q&amp;amp;A and I also showed it in my back to
school haul so yeah so then the next
favorite is something that I've chosen
so excited to talk to you guys about but
it is this water bottle and you guys
love came out just like this I cook a
lot about whatever but no this is from
loci you guys know I wear these two bad
boys on my wrist I love love-love-love
k-chill the meaning of loci and like
everything they do so look I just
recently came out these water bottles oh
it's super cool about this water bottle
is when you buy the water pack 10% of
the net profits go to charity water and
100 percent of low Kai's donations will
help fund water projects in Ethiopia and
like guys that's so cool if you guys
didn't know currently 663 million people
live without clean drinking water and
lokai wants to help charity water change
that and so do i and so should you guys
so if the water pack comes with is first
a lokai bracelet which is the water one
of course and it just comes at the very
top when you unpackage it it's packaged
so cute I'm obsessed and then the VR
headset and what's so so so cool about
this is that with the viewer provided in
the pack which I'm showing you here
members of the loci circle which I am
part of and you can become part of to by
buying this umm but pretty much you just
use your cell phone and the link
provided to it these little glass things
on and you just watch this little
awesome experience on here it says stay
humble and stay hopeful which is so so
so so cute
find your balance inside the water
bottle like if you look and you see it
but then you see like it backwards on
that this is a classic top can also by
the adventure won the sport one and the
desk top ones I'm just really excited to
be able to share this and work with loci
on this because this is an amazing cause
I know the bracelets really popular and
really cool but I think this message is
really amazing it can really help a lot
of kids out there and a lot of people
who don't have clean drinking water this
water bottle has definitely been a
favorite also just drinking water I
drink so much water and talked about in
like
start a healthy lifestyle video I don't
know I love water now I drink it so
often I drink it so much I feel so much
more like energized and better when I
drink water so if you guys are ever
feeling down or sluggish or whatever
drink water I promise you it'll make you
feel better I love love love love love
drinking water so then my first beauty
favorite is this Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation I'm in the shade nude I'm
wearing it right now I've been wearing
this in the past like I don't know
probably like five ten probably five six
seven eight of my last video this thing
is amazing so well I've been obsessed
with it it says medium to full coverage
foundation it's oil free I don't know it
just goes on so effortlessly and
literally just covers up like all your
imperfections like bow like right away
so I have been obsessed with this I just
use this with my Beauty Blender and it's
just a miracle it's just a little just
little dream in a jar my next Beauty
favorite is a palette and it is the
heart let in bloom palette and I got
this thing for my birthday at the
beginning of August and I've been using
this thing like crazy first of all it
smells like chocolate well it has a ton
of pretty matte colors and also has some
shimmer colors and it's just like the
perfect colors I'm going on right now I
love it so yeah a lot of you guys have
been asking a tutorial with this palette
so if you want that calm down below and
like this video
hmm my last makeup beauty product
favorite is this Becca highlighter in
Champagne pop oh my good it is a big
beautiful I'm wearing it right now if
you're wondering whenever I put this on
I honestly just feel like a glowing
goddess movie oh my god oh wait a bit of
credit somehow my dog knows how to open
doors

just opened the door and it was shot at
home alone so it scared me super badly
no I never shut the door while you're
off please on your way no okay okay I'm
gonna figure what I'm saying there oh
yeah so yeah I've been loving this Becca
champagne pop highlighter you guys know
my holy grail is the Anasazi of Beverly
Hills blue palette but this is this is
been taken over and love love love love
this so then the next favorite which is
like kind of be really didn't put a knot
tear speedy right Eva NYC freshen up dry
shampoo and first of all the packaging
is
so cute yes of course I lost the cap
somewhere or my mother but this thing
smells so good this thing smells like
perfume like when I put it in my hair I
literally feel like I'm just applying
perfume it also works really well it's
not tested on animals which is amazing
amazing amazing just really comes in
handy when you're having those bad
really hair days now I have some like
random food favorites because I love the
first thing I'll do is this popcorn and
if you guys know yes I am vegan so this
is vegan I'm also gonna eat some all
right I just spent three months eating
if I popcorn my teeth I apologize boom
chick boom boom chicka pop lightly sweet
popcorn there's 35 calories to cut like
what and then 120 calories per serving
whatever they put the lower number on
the front it's not too sweet so solid
super cuddly super sweet know you but
it's not like just playing popcorn which
I don't know I love it's just like a
hint of sweetness
super-good likes just like lightly
kettled I've on this thing probably like
10 done and this is like an amazing
snack an amazing little dessert just so
you know Netflix and chill with yourself
speaking of Netflix my TV show favorite
for this month even though I watched it
in one day like two days when I was in
LA with Olivia we watched seven episodes
in one day and I just watched like the
last one when I got home the show
stranger things on Netflix oh my god oh
it's so good if you guys watch the
stranger things come down below your
favorite character because I literally
we're just gonna blow up the comments
with just talking about stranger things
because that show is so good and give
this video a thumbs up if you like
sharing your things - at first I was
like okay whatever like you watch super
stuff so it's kind of slow and then it
keeps going and the whole time your mind
is like what is going on it is honestly
just like a mind blow in a show right oh
my god if you guys have not seen it I
would highly suggest it's not even that
scary it's just like not thriller either
it's just like you don't know how to
wrap your head around it I can't like
when people ask me what it's about I
don't even know what to say I'm just
like and watch it so definitely suggest
that if One Tree Hill is my baby it's my
child I'm still obsessed with I so watch
it but like but I mean
a second season of search of things ASAP
so Netflix till then the last favorite
which is kind of like food but I don't
know cure a cup and if you guys now I'm
like really probably badly obsessed with
coffee I'm 17 and I have a cup of coffee
every day that's not good
someday someday I'll stop but this is
the Starbucks vanilla artificially
flavored you know it's vegan don't worry
I got you but this is the vanilla and
caramel ones I cheering out of the
caramel ones the cotton ones are
probably my favorite one and then
vanilla is probably my second favorite
one these are so good just curing in a
whole was one of the best things I've
ever bought in my entire life I'll just
make this put some soy milk in it and
then put some likes you guys told me
with stevia but I said stevia like I
don't know how to say it stevia stevia
whatever literally just tastes like a
latte I don't remember the last time I
went to Starbucks because I can make my
own at home so yeah I hope you guys
