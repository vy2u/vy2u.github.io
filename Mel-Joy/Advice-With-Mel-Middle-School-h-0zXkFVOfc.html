middle-school advice video for you guys
looks leave your 6th 7th and 8th graders
because I recently just graduated from
middle school so I'm going on high
school so I thought I could share my
wisdom with people that are now
attending high school or will be
attending high school I wish I could
have known these things before I went
into middle school let's get right into
it
number one most important thing I think
is to be yourself because I know some
people have not been themselves and then
they make the wrong friends and they end
up in the wrong places so you have to
make sure especially when you're making
new friends in middle school that you
are true to yourself and you have to be
yourself because when I acted like
myself and when I was myself in middle
school I made some lifelong friends that
were very similar to me they had a lot
of similar interests and I've also made
some friends when I wasn't acting
totally like myself that we're not as
close because we don't get along very
well because we don't have similar
interests so make sure to be yourself I
know one of my biggest worries in middle
school is being judged up ton of people
worried about being judged in middle
school but you won't be judged if you're
really confident by yourself if you can
just look over be like hey judge me I
don't care I'm gonna be myself and I'm
gonna be confident you have to make sure
to be confident in middle school and
when you see people be confident you
kind of like look up to them like wow I
wish I could be as confident as they are
so make sure to be yourself and to be
confident about who you are number two
is even though you're focusing on being
yourself you have to make sure to stay
focused in the academic related areas
because although making friends is
really important and having a social
life is really important the main reason
why you're at that school is to learn
and to do well so
have to make sure to stay focused in
school make sure you come home and do
your homework before you go out with
friends I love when you have to make
sure to stay focused in school
everything that you do in middle school
lead you to what you do in high school
what you do in college what you're doing
your entire life you have to make sure
that school is the first priority and
social is the second priority my kind of
way of how I stay focused in school in
class is to separate yourself from your
friends I know that can be really hard
especially if you're in a class with
your friends but you have to make sure
that you're paying attention in class
and you're listening to the lectures or
the video or whatever you're doing and
you're not side talking with your friend
because there's other times you can have
friends over the weekend when you don't
have as much homework and also when you
get home don't go right away and text
your friends and hang out with them make
sure you have a quick snack and then do
your homework and then hopefully you'll
have tightening out your friends or text
your friends after homework because I
know if you don't give your homework all
your individual attention you'll get
distracted and you won't be learning as
much and you won't do it and you won't
be doing as well as work as you could be
if you had all your attention on your
homework yes you have to be very focused
in school but number three is be social
I know that some that's really hard for
some people but put school first and
then social second so if you don't throw
your homework call a friend invite them
over and watch a movie with them having
friends is was a really important part
my middle school experience some of the
memories I made with my friends will
never forget and they were some of the
best days of my life well so be social
and also stay folks in school
number four is being cluesive there are
some people that don't really go
straight into a relationship and say
like hey let's be friends there's some
people that kind of stay on the side and
I know some of my best friends today
were really shy but like I said like hey
come hang out with us or people do that
with me whenever that happens to me I
could really like special like oh thanks
for inviting me to hang out with you
guys so make sure to be inclusive don't
judge a book by it's cover although
someone's looking over in the corner
reading and you're like oh they're lame
they could be a really cool person so
make sure to just talk to people it's a
great way to make friends if you
inclusive I mean the more friends the
merrier yeah number five don't be afraid
to try new things I know that can be
really hard in my school at least I was
there for a really long time around
seventh and eighth grade all the friend
groups started changing and it got
really weird and I didn't like it and I
was really not up for making new friends
leaving my old ones but you don't have
to make friends you don't have to only
make new friends get rid of the old ones
you can make new friends keep the old
one be friends with all of them together
I know in my middle school experience
there was a lot of friend group changing
but I made some of my closest friends in
seventh and eighth grade while the
friend groups were changing everything
so let change happen I know it can be a
scary thing but it might be worth it all
in the end
number six is be involved you know join
clubs go to sports rallies after school
join a sports team I know I was on my
basketball team at my school and it was
so much fun getting hang out with all my
friends after school and do the thing I
love playing basketball just don't be
afraid to be involved in your school you
know playing a dance or playing a movie
night for your grade or and your grade
might really benefit from that be
involved okay guys so those were my six
tips for incoming middle schoolers I
hope some of those things were helpful
for you guys
I know I wish I got those tips when I
went into middle school so I really hope
