need a plane to be your skate
eggie to play
with hey guys it's me Mel and today's
video is going to be a back to school
makeup tutorial on this look you guys
keep asking for me to do tutorials so
that's what we're doing today if your
invite channel hi I'm Mel it's great to
meet you I would love it if you
subscribed it makes my heart super happy
I have faith that you know where the
button is I think it's here did I master
yet or is it here you know one of those
so yeah I just think this is a really
like glowy fresh makeup look for
back-to-school this is literally just an
idea I'm not saying afterwards this much
makeup or if you think this is not
enough so yeah if you would like to see
how to get this look then stay tuned and
keep watching so the first thing I did
was apply my clinic moisturizer just to
moisturize my face for the makeup I'm
gonna do a talk through toriel just
because I feel like it's more like one
one so then the next thing I'm going to
do is apply my baby skin maybelline
primer just to prime my face after your
face is all primed I'm going to take or
in this way foundation in nude and then
I'm going to take my just washed Beauty
Blender like how beautiful is this and
I'm just going to apply literally Justin
Landon spots on my face I'm using a
foundation because I've been breaking
out recently but for back-to-school I
would probably go with a BB cream or a
CC cream or whatever a tinted
moisturizer but right now my skin is
just like not cooperating with me
whatsoever you ever feel like you're
forgetting a step when you do your
makeup you don't know what I make sure
to blend it down oh my god himself we
sure to blend it down your neck so once
I'm done with the foundation I'm going
to go in with my age rewind concealer
from Maybelline and I'm going to drag it
down to my nose and then up into a
triangle form
I was watching tutorials last night I
forget her name but she said to do it
this way you know we're going to try it
up and this is in light by the way if
you're wondering I'm also going to put
that on my chin on my forehead
pick that area and I'm going to take I
also previously washed be blender like a
little concealer one
going to be blending that out also onto
the eyelid can hear my sister singing
I'm actually really bothered by the fact
that I've been breaking out I don't
remember if I said this but both the
beauty blenders were damp BAM bend damp
damp and also have a vein on my nose so
it's going to cover that up I know it
gets super red throughout the day I do
not know why always has probably always
will doing your makeup on camera is
always a struggle instant age rewind
concealer in finger I'm gonna put this
around my nose and to highlight my mouth
just cuz you get really red there don't
want to be red throw the dice
this is like pretty much highlighting
kind of another screen roll done it but
I also use the Beauty Blender so it
blends in better because it's not my
skin tone whatsoever don't you hate when
get little hairs and you can see like
how am I supposed to get that out stress
stress stress leave dude also for
back-to-school sometimes I was like just
wear concealer and then powder but like
I just said my face is breaking out so
I'm not about that right now then I'm
taking my other little green Beauty
Blender for concealer or a marseilles
translucent powder and I'm gonna bake
buy some on my chin on my forehead area
where my little pimples are because love
ask me then hello my nose once you're
looking like the go do you ever get this
powder all over your legs a lot of my
friends are back to school today so and
I've known EMS and it's chill it's Jo Jo
I'm going to come out my brows you guys
know my dog do anything on my brows I
just comb them with a little spoolie and
there's no product on it I'm just coming
through like so and there's my eye
poverty now we're gonna get rid of all
this X X ass Texas Exes xxx
oh my god X's yeah all this powder
that's an unnecessary I'm taking more of
the transistor powder that's just
rubbing on top of the makeup over it I
love having peach fuzz on my face
because no matter how much face makeup I
wear I look cakey if you guys feel my
pain like this video comment
peachfuzz fan Oh now that we're done
with the face and it looks like I'm not
a hormonal breaking out teenager mess
going to take the champagne Papa Becca
highlighter oh look at that
I'm going to take that I'm a little
highlighted blush something with my
little brush oh god that was important
okay less is more and I'm going to apply
that to the apples of my cheeks and it's
going to smile see where the light falls
and then I'm going to place them on my
nose this is like my favorite thing ah
yes I love highlighter I'm gonna use my
fingers to apply it under my brow bone
as well
everyone always text me while I'm
filming and then other than that I don't
get texts put some of them I keep it's
tough and I just look like a gluing
goddess now taking my little bronzer I
love this bronzer and then the brush on
the other sides right under that
highlighter and don't worry we're going
to blend this out I apply it kind of
harshly at first I'm just bringing it up
my face my temples on what is that
called my right huh and then on my jaw
line I'm taking the Laura Mercier powder
again putting this where I want the
browser to and you know the drill oh oh
I'm so hungry so we're just doing that
you got a nice line or a bronzer ends
and then I'm taking my ELF powder brush
there's no product on it and I'm
blending it we're bonding it everywhere
mmm oh wait and then I also put some
just on the sides of my nose really
lightly blend the nose as well now
moving on to eyes of the middle closer I
can't find my eyeshadow primer I usually
use the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer but
I'm just going to use concealer so now
I'm taking my key 5 4 Sigma brush really
like pink champagne color I'm just going
to apply that all over the lid and then
I'm taking my Sigma e30 8 brush it's
like light brown and I'm going to swirl
that in too
Karif or your guys's creases on your
eyes different because mine are it's
weird I don't know don't worry if it's a
little sloppy or anything because we're
gonna be blended very soon so after
we're done with that light brown color
I'm just going to go in with a little
bit of a darker brown I'm just going to
show this into the outer feet into the
crease and this is like a warmer love
because you're trying to bring in the
warm tones of summer to school you know
what I'm saying so I'm doing that on the
other side just an outer V and swirling
it into the crease just to add some
dimension to your eye I'm going to blend
this all out like so I'm taking same
brush I used as before and I'm taking a
goldish kind of color and I'm just
packing this on to the center of my lids
or some dimension it's gonna give just a
really pretty detail to the look and I'm
obsessed with just a little hint of like
shimmer and you can also drive that into
your inner corner but I am going to be
taking he like matte white and focus
that in the inner corner right now
because you want to look awake so after
that I'm just going to be taking Coastal
Scents no.2 brush with the same brown
color you put in the crease and I'm
going to be applying that on my bottom
lash line and I'm also going to be
bringing it up and kind of making almost
like a wing of eye shut up just like
that you know bringing it up I think
this adds honestly so much to the look
you could do eyeliner if you want you
could skip eyeliner if you I could do
whatever but what I like doing is just
taking a angled brush with like a dark
chocolate brown and just focusing this
on my lashline
not even like very precisely just kind
of sloppily then you can also wing it
out if you would like I just I love I
love
I'm going to just take that and let's
make a little I mean like shop my beauty
blender I'm just kind of touching that
up I know I like the way it looks that's
just me then I kind of feel like I'm
giving off like a little Egyptian vibe
right now just you know well I'm at it
just to make it a little smoother then
I'm taking my waterproof elf eyeliner
crayons I've been using this thing since
day one and I'm just applying this on my
tight line was this cold yeah that is
tight line to make my eyelashes appear
thicker and fuller and blacker and all
that good stuff honestly I should stop
using this I think it's expired because
it always makes my eyes super red good
job yeah I still use it and then I'm
also applying it to my waterline and a
little bit on the lower lash line so now
I'm taking my eyelash curler I'm just
curling my lashes Wow so once I'm done
with that I'm taking my feminine sex
waterproof mascara I'm obsessed with
this thing it's the mini one and I'm
just going to be applying this to my
lashes and then also to my bottom lashes
and then once I'm done with that I'm
taking my covergirl clump crusher and
I'm putting this through it just to come
those crush crush those clumps so once I
finish the mascara I did get a little on
me you know so I'm going to take my
little spooley just kind of DAB it all
because once it's dry it'll just kind of
just like crust off that sounded really
good if my mascara is clumpy I will take
eyes are so worried this little comb may
go tools and just brush through it so
now where's out with the eyes and we're
going to move on to the lips I'm taking
my ELF lip exfoliator I'm just gonna
exploit it
I love those cute color fast Sally
Hansen's it's a tint and moisture balm
just a really pretty nude color things
like this are perfect for school because
it's natural it's easy it's moisturizing
it's all you know fell there to finish
off the makeup I'm taking my Urban Decay
makeup setting spray and you know the
drill and if you don't know the drill
who's held it and sprayed it in an X
however many times I did it on my face
my eyebrow I was really pissing off so I
just plucked it a little bit you know so

pretty and good for school yeah so I
