thank you for sticking with me on this
journey in a way it's kind of cool
because we're all growing up and we're
all changing and evolving together and
yeah so thank you for all the support on
that video I just really quickly wanted
to say that because it means so so much
also I know this background is getting a
little boring because you've been seeing
it recently and it's like the only place
I've been filming I am asking something
in my next video which I'm so excited
about where I am right now is change it
up soon so stay tuned I'm get it and I
have some cooler butter that goes I'm so
excited but yeah stick with me on this
background I was boring but no things
coming be no things come and because you
guys didn't know I actually do online
school so technically I don't really
need all of the supplies that I bought
and have so I'm going to give them away
to one of you guys pretty much all you
have to do to win is click the link down
below and just fill out that little like
form type of thing pretty much just like
different entries so the more entries
you do the more chance you will have a
winning just click the link it'll have
everything there for you to make it a
little easier for you guys and also
comment down below and tell me when you
start school just so I can kind of time
my back school videos and everything
like that so most of you guys can see
them unless if that makes sense so yeah
I'm bigger anything else to say so let's
go get into the video so everything is
in the Track Pack and it's really heavy
I can fit everything just like hold on
gonna live in but is the first thing I
got you guys is this backpack and before
you guys are like mal about the plain
black backpack like be more basic be
more boring for me if I were to be going
to high school I don't love the like 20
backpacks or whatever
I just like basic stuff like this and
then designing I like myself and like
customizing it myself
so with this backpack what I would
probably do is I put some pins on it and
like around it or like draw nails like
silver sharpie I don't know I didn't
know if everyone or like printed ones or
plain ones or whatever so I just got
this basic black line and then you guys
can go crazy with it and have fun with
it and make it yours is it more
personality and everything like that so
I just thought its kind of like a fun
idea I'll just start with this this is
your pencil case once again it is plain
but that's just you know I would buy it
for myself so I tried to buy what I
would buy for me for you guys and hope
that you guys like the same stuff as me
I don't know it's just a little pencil
case
it's like seems really sturdy which is
sick it has brown inside which is cool
another basic great color so then for
binders I got you guys to binders just
cuz I don't really know how many classes
you have just I personally didn't use a
binder for every class I like make some
or whatever I don't know so just 92 and
the first color is upside-down it's
really pretty like paint color of what
the fabric is legit guys like this is a
nice feeling binder so when I saw this I
like I have to get it it's pearlescent
to like it's almost as a highlighter
before you apply it to the face you know
that I mean Who am I
and then the cycle line is just as all
grey one once again you can customize it
do whatever you want with it but I
really like the look of like rain pink
and like black so yeah I got you these
two and they're both one-inch I believe
yeah they're both one inch and then I
got you guys some notebooks once again
everything is this item I got you this
one college-ruled an elbow which is what
he's in high school and I'm hoping that
you guys do first - whichever grade
reads but yes and then this one actually
has three notebooks in it which I love
these like these were so cool to me in
high school since it's divided in three
sections I would always use this for
like three different classes and it was
just so much easier to bring this around
instead of three of these but if you
like this wrap better then you'll like
this one
and hopefully you could still use this
would - then to go with the binder I
also got you guys some just college
rules paper because I know I go through
paper like crazy taking out some classes
and stuff or I did so this would be
helpful for me and I hope it would be
hopeful for you and then I just got you
guys some tab dividers there's five of
them and I like these colors these are
just super easy to see when you have the
menu
I'm very and whatever for when you need
your classes to be a little bit more
organized and then a couple more
notebooks I did get you guys was one
this composition book and then I got you
guys to sketch notebook and what I
really like about this is I'm a sucker
for like doodling or just drawing when
I'm bored I don't know that's what I
would always do in class but pay
attention to the teacher to kids them
yeah I detectives but this notebook is
just playing pages and it's like a lot
of them so hopefully this can be for
your doodles or free random thoughts or
feel like poetry depends the person and
why you use it for but I thought it
would be good for your personal use and
not just for school so then I got you
guys some pencils
I got your regular pencils the number
two because you take the SAT with these
and all that stuff and it's a lot of fun
I just got these because some teachers
can be strict about what pencils you use
under why but sometimes they are and
then of course I had to be a kid for
like two seconds and get you some cool
bright erasable okay alright the books
we read that again erasable the small
things are what makes me happy the fact
that these are erasable that makes me
happy I wish I had these when I went to
high school and I didn't so maybe
they're like new but they seem to just
so cool to me now I had to so then I
also got you guys a ten count of Sharpie
highlighters it comes with pink yellow
orange green blue purple and it has no
bleed smear resistant okay and then of
course I just had to get you guys some
simple ballpoint pen also for pencils I
got you guys these Paper Mate mechanical
pencils because these were my favorite
things I always loved mechanical pencils
but these are always my favorite and I
would only buy these otherwise I was
picky but I just got you this set of
colors and three of them because these
Center expenses but like so nice and
they're so worth the money then I just
got you some scissors I got kids
scissors because that's what we used
most of the time even though we're in
high school I tried to get it kind of
matching try to have some sort of a
theme but it's kind of hard when school
supplies need to be rainbow so
everything is kind of colored of course
I have to get you some erasers because
everyone makes mistakes like ryubi's and
I'm kind of like this with that orange
one right there um might buy it for
myself
I just like that color and of course it
comes with a little toppers that you can
put
on the pencils I got to be than these
which I don't see everyone used but I
use them all the time just because I
lose track of where I put things like in
my binder so if I have these I just
flipped in pages and then I like write
what's on it then I got you two scotch
tape just regular tape because honestly
everything I've I feel I don't assess
''tis so I just felt like this is also a
necessity and then I got you this three
pack of glue sticks but these are just
your normal glue sticks okay they're
colored and they're lightweight ombre
this is yellow this is green this is
purple I don't think the color really
makes a difference but they look cool
and then I got you this ruler I was
giving at you a wood ruler but I all
noose plastic ruler
I love these detail too not necessary
but hey I got to this one a third one
and this is just red because red is one
of my favorite colors what's also cool
about this which I've never seen is it
has a finger grip make you see that so
when you're moving around I wanted to be
precise you're not to move it around
cheers you move around with this which
is a little extra but like the works or
works okay um so just found this in the
bag alone I almost forgot about it and I
would have been still mattifies a little
but of course I have to get you a fidget
I just I have to get you a fidget I am a
nerd when it comes to things like this
yes that was a social still advanced yes
I am up special surgeons and this one is
not just this amazing orange color which
I love and I almost want to take her
from you guys but I will I really like
to tell orange hopefully you do too I
just thought with dope but this goes in
the dark people it glows in the dark I
have one that glows in the dark and I'm
obsessed with it and I think it's really
cool so that is every oh that is
everything in the backpack but no I'm
not done hold up so I'm also giving away
a couple random things just cause like I
don't know I thought things were fun and
good for back to school so yeah so
pretty much you're going to be winning
this portable charger and this is just
like a teal color pineapple with a pink
top I thought kind of matched
kinda these are so helpful I never had
one when I went to school and my phone
would be dead by like this series fourth
period some tears today sorry although I
wish I had one of these and I think it's
so helpful because I was always
searching my phone with someone else's
charger this you guys don't have to do
that like I did you'll be wanting this
too so yeah I will just be wetting this
this is just a little extra thing that I
was like hey you guys might like this oh
yeah and I also came with these emoji
stick
is source I'll give you guys two
supports analyze your notebooks or
whatever with them and then the last
thing which I think I've given away like
how many of these as I get annoying I'm
like pretty sure I've given em away in
videos maybe birthday gifts I can't
remember but this is Rick Lera sonic Mia
fit just because I know I've started
experiencing a lot of breakouts when I
was in school and everything like that
it was really you know like what's going
on like how are you rid of this and I
think this is one of the first steps to
helping that I have one I use it I love
it so I thought I would get you guys
this one and it's mini which is cute
because I have this full one and the
many one and I think the many ones
better so like traveling you can even
bring it to school if you wanted to wash
your face after PE or anything like that

think that's actually all I'm going to
be giving away to this giveaway but I
