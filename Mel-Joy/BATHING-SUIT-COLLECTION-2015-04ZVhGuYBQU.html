I'm going to be doing a swimsuit
collection because it's summertime so I
thought I might as well show you guys
what's going I'm going to be wearing
without further ado let's just get on
into it so the first room suit I have is
actually from triangle and it is the
blue one so I have this just this blue
triangle one and I think it's really
cute these are the bottoms it's made of
Nia frame and it's pretty expensive but
it's cute other I've mixed feelings
about triangles from suits but I like
this one recently I just ordered a lot
of swimsuits from Victoria's Secret
because I just been in the swimsuit mood
I don't know so the first time suit I
got was the strapless one it's a size 32
see I believe it fits really well it's
not push up but I really like it
the bottoms that I got to go for this
were these like graffiti speckled kind
of floral bottoms that are ruched but I
really like then just kind of size small
with that these are really cute together
so then another swimsuit I have from
Victoria Secret that I recently just
ordered is this black one that has white
detailing I'm super cute and it just
looks like this summer padded and it's
super supportive and cute and I didn't
get a bottom to match that particularly
because I have like some mix-and-match
bottoms but these are two bottoms that I
can wear with them that I will also show
you guys so the first one just looks
like this and it's just a really light
blue color
they're called the mini bottoms I think
and then it has a little card up here
and they're so so cute and I really like
this color and I think it looks cute
together and then I also have the exact
same style ones but in a hot pink and I
have this to match a top I will show you
next but the same style and I really
like them too they make you look pain
cuz they're neon so then the top I have
to go with that looks like this and it
looks a little bit more sporty to me
it's just like this halter top and then
the back looks like this and it has
black the hot pink and like some purple
they look really cute together since the
back so I like toward these so I have
those so then the next episode I have is
this one from dre secret also and it's
white and it looks like this and it just
has gold detailing in the back and it
has straps that you can wear like this
or crossed or halter so I really like
that and then the bottoms I just have to
go with that their cheeks tur and they
are um like tie-dye blue and they're
ruched in the front and in the butt I
think they look really cute together
because of the whiteness and Santa and
it has a little heart up there and these
are in a small line I really like these
together so then the next bottoms I have
which are just universal bottoms are
just spread they look like this they're
from Airy I just kind of wear these with
any top that I would like I guess and
then I have another halter style top for
Victoria's Secret and it looks like this
and it's patterned like tribal pattern
and I really like to wear this with like
a plain black bottom or like these or
just these this matches kind of anything
and the black bottom that I have to go
with that and also this one um is this
and it is the same style as the tie-dyed
ones but they're just in black and the
ruched in the butt and in the front and
it has the part here and I think they're
cute and these are kind of just the
bottoms that I can wear with really top
any because they're black so then the
next job I have is this like pink top
from airy and it's just like pink and
then in the back it has
this crossing like this in a hot pink
color and I think it's really cute and
then I also have these Victoria Secret
bottoms that I got while ago um like a
year ago
I don't even know if they fit me more
but they're just these pattern ones like
this
and I wear this with this top that I got
with them that is the same color as this
actually and it's just scalloped here
and on the bottom and it's cute and I
really like it and then I also have this
one that actually doesn't fit me really
well um but it's the same style as the
black one I just showed and then the
same color is that one but I just I
don't really wear this one because it's
a little big
um but it's cute so yeah and then I also
have this triangle swimsuit not actually
triangle but just like actual the style
is triangle it's this purple one just
looks like this bottom just look like
this and I think I got it at t.j.maxx so
then the last one Souter I have is this
one from Target in the bottoms up like
this and they're tribal and they're like
this on the side normal but and then the
top i just pair with that is this top
this black bando but also the strap here
just has some um I'm giving what is this
and it just ties in the back and this is
a medium and super cute and yeah I
believe those all the swimsuits that I
have but I could be wrong that is my
