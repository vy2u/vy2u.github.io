right okay hey guys so today's video is
going to be a Black Friday haul so real
quick before I start this video I have
forgotten to talk about this in my last
two videos but I came out with an app it
is called Mel joy yeah Mel joy it's on
the App Store if you search Mel joy and
you should download it to keep up with
me it has all of my social media on it
it's just pretty much everything to do
with me you can access through that app
it's free on the App Store the link will
be in the downbar click it download it
and yeah let's get on with the video
some of the stuff I bought was not on
sale and I was like okay whatever just a
couple things but I'm not gonna show you
guys that stuff today I'm going to show
you guys that in a further haul because
I'm going to be doing a fall winter all
just a little bit later because I have
some stuff that I also got not on Black
Friday then I want to show you guys so
yeah let's just get started I'm gonna
start Pakistan that is actually the
first place I went
I thought PacSun had probably the best
deals out of most of the places I went
so I was back said but the first thing I
got was this flannel and they were
having flannel sale it was $15 for all
flames out like I can work with this I
only really loved one so it was a $15
sale for a flannel and this final is
like blue with like maroon stripes
you guys know my living room and then
like white in it too and I think it's
cute it's really soft like layering this
like opening it when I was like a shirt
and then like an over Jack or something
I don't know I think it could definitely
be very cute and it was usually 3695 on
715 so yeah I got this flannel I got any
small for all you that don't like it
when I say sizes just ignore my sizes
because a lot of you asked me to say my
sizes and I get a lot of comments
talking about my sizes but I don't want
any controversy going on with this I'm
going to say my sizes
and I'm sorry if you guys have a problem
with that but just so many people have
told me how it helps them because
they're about the same size as me so
they would know what size to get in
things that I got I'm sorry if you don't
like it if I say my sizes and then the
next thing I got from PacSun they were
having a buy one get one 50% off all
store so anything including brandy
melville which everyone was so glad
because brainy little does not have
sales the first thing I got was this
maroon sweatshirt Eddie's from obey it
has this really cute design on it and
it's like not white but it's like faded
white I guess and it says art is an
indirect force for change I actually
didn't notice this but there's like the
obey face in the center and it's just
like pretty like floral designs and I
thought this would be cute for the
wintertime and it's really soft in the
inside I love their crew necks I have
one like for screen one not with this
print so I got in a small I technically
bought it for $50 yeah but then the
second thing I got for 50% off was this
brandy Melville jacket was usually $50
so I got 425
and it's brandy melville so I mean
that's good deal and it's this it's
actually pretty warm I wasn't expecting
to be that warm it's just like this
black almost like a bomber jacket not
quite but it's like this really thick
jacket it just cuffs at the sleeves has
a little collar and then the gold zipper
and I actually love this on and I was
really happy that I got this I got 425
instead 50 so I thought that was a great
deal the next thing I thought Pakistan I
also got buy one get one half off also
from brandy melville and I've been
looking for a little like choker
necklace that has like coins on it
because I'm talking about like little
silver coins like small ones and I saw
this and it reminded me of it and
they're not coins but there are these
little gold circles and I thought this
would be so cute and it was usually 895
so I got this oh yeah the thing that I
technically got for 50% off was a
keychain and put it on the keys it's
this alien keychain I'm ready Melville
it just looks like this and it was you
usually 495 so out of like $2 so that is
all I got at PacSun but I was happy with
what I got I thought the deals were good
I'm in need of jackets because today was
31 degrees out like a wet it was so cold
I went outside my hands are really like
froze I was like ah ha it's also getting
dark out did you see that I don't know
if you see that but it's getting darker
and it's 446 I think that's so lame oh
wait I lied I like then I went back to
pax on the next day forgot about this we
got two pairs of jeans because the jeans
were by oh and go I'm free and I thought
that was a great deal their dues are you
really like other jeans I got we're
usually 49.95 so I got two for 50 which
is like $25 for jeans and for packs on
jeans I felt that was a good feel the
first pair I dot I have been looking for
black jeans I've been watching black
jeans for very long I wanted thick good
black jeans it have like jeggings and
things like that a legitimate jeans and
I saw these and they're like ankle pants
so it cuts off in your ankle which I
think's a little bizarre my friend was
like those look like they're just short
they said if I cuff them it would be
cute so when I cuffed them it looked
cute so I'm gonna cuff them when I wear
them and they're just black jeans but
they have little holes in the knees
which I love the look of little
distressed and their high-rise but
they're not really that high right I got
them in at 24 so they're usually for 995
yes this was the first pair of jeans I
got they're like sick good quality jeans
which is what I've been looking for and
then the second pair of jeans I didn't
really know what jeans I wanted but my
friends will do so all these are so
grunge of this acid light wash jeans
similar piling Kendall collection I
think yeah but the bottom just looks
like this I'm not a huge fan of the bar
so what I do when I wear them I just
cuff them twice like this and I'm
thinking of distressing them more
because there's already like holes in
the knees but I want to make them look
more grunge I think I might just like
de-stress more of the leg
sure yet I'm also not sure if I'm
keeping this size and all because I
kinda want to get a bigger size it's a
little bit like looser on me like not
like boyfriend style jeans but it's like
a little looser I'm gonna decide whether
or not to keep this size or not but I
got those two pairs of jeans buy one get
one free I thought that was a good deal
so then the next place I went to was
Sports Authority this is definitely what
I got the most at really good deals I
saved so much money Anna you monitor how
much money I would have spent if nothing
was on sale the first thing I got were
these spandex cuz my spandex were never
so old I just got of the one of the blue
band because I thought it was cute and
like a nice pop color they say Nike
pro-ice got her small it was usually 28
but all Nike was 25% off let me see if I
can find the list it so I can't find my
seat was 25% off those if anyone really
wants to do that Matt staying on the
side of Nike and shorts I got these Nike
sports shorts and I love these I was
needing some sports shorts I saw these
and I was like so they're like all black
even like the lines on the side that's
usually like a different color it's like
all entirely black but then silver
swoosh I think they look so nice like
I've tried them on and my friend was
like you have to get those
they almost look matte she said and
she's feeling so badass so I was like
all right I just got him an extra small
there's $30 then 25% off so then the
next thing also staying along the line
of Nike I got this sports bra and it is
just this blue color and this is pretty
much my school color don't I play
basketball games I can wear this and it
would like show uniform so I'll be
showing school spirit so it's like this
like sky-blue color then this is like
more Columbia ish blue
the Nike sign like Tiffany blue and the
band and I just got it in a small this
was usually 35 25 cent off but it came
out to like 22 or something
I figure should have everything off it
was like 20 something because I don't
know if I wasn't sure I was gonna get it
but then my friends like 22 percent like
that's a good deal like in Nike sports
bra I love getting this I wish I had the
receipt show you guys but I honestly
can't find I think it's in my car and I
don't
the next thing I got similar - sports
Perez was this adidas sports bra 20% or
it's actually so much 50% off and it's
just as black sea sports Broughton says
adidas and silver and this is so
comfortable I just got it in an
extra-small it was usually 25 but it's
really soft and comfortable
it's like mesh in the back and yes I got
those two sports cross I saw this and I
was like oh my god you're mine because I
love windbreakers I don't know why I
just think they're so cute and I've been
wanting windbreakers for such a long
time I got multiple on this trip one of
them wasn't really on sale so I'm not
going to show you guys I'll show you
guys in my next haul but this one is
just from adidas and this was 50% off
usually 65 and it was like 32 and it's
just this navy blue windbreaker with the
stripes on the side and then it has this
logo adidas with a zipper here the hood
I think it's so you actually really warm
and comfortable I just got in a small
pretty that's the guy's jacket so it's a
little oversized like cinched at the
bottom and cuffed cinched your sleeves
so happy this was on sale I definitely
would have paid full price for it on a
regular day but it was on sale the next
thing I got not super exciting but if
you guys like basketball I just got some
more basketball socks fused in no I play
basketball ideas are just the nike elite
socks I get them in a size 6 to 18 then
6 to 10 women's and it's just black with
this blue because my school colors as I
said and then there's gray on it too and
these are usually 14 and there's 25% off
also if you had like a rewards card
you've got two times the points I think
I know if it was just for that gear for
everything so I got my card a lot of
points and then the next thing I'll
7news a school and leave everything just
like helps transition together are these
basketball shorts they're black with
white I don't know if you guys are even
interested in this at all but this is au
s-- large because I like youth bicycle
shorts better these are just for
basketball so I thought I'd show them
because I got them and they were on sale
well there's no price tag on it I think
they were 22 I think there was the same
as the sports bra but I'm not sure I
tried this on my friends I can see that
it's so cute so it's this long sleeve
shirt and long I really like long
sleeves recently and
it just has someone spinning basketball
my finger and then the Nike symbol
across it I like it a lot and it's like
black and white red and it's like slave
and it's a kids shirt and a large and it
was usually 22 but I got for like
fifteen or sixteen you guess what if I
press it off it'll be good to wear
basketball or wherever the next thing I
got we're a pair of sweatpants
I love me my sweatpants so these are
just the champion sweatpants they're
light gray I just got them in a small
and these were 50% off and they were
$21.99 turned on for like $10 which is
really cheap for sweat pants the last
thing I got from 4:30 which is probably
one of my favorite things it's
definitely not the most fashionable
thing these are probably the most
comfortable pants I've ever owned I'm
going to be honest these are from adidas
and there are these like sweat pants
kind of except they don't cuff at the
end like these are the Suzie's just
cinched here and here these ones are
black with grey detailing and it's just
like soft on the outside but the inside
is the most comfortable thing its fleece
can you guys do this you see that it's
fleece
like I was wearing them earlier I took
them off for the video I put them on and
I was like do I get them and my friend
was like oh not the Kunis and like but
they're so comfortable I just got them a
small and they're so comfortable I can't
get over the side and they're usually 45
on so for like 20 so when I saw the
price I was like I have to get them
they're so comfortable
um like I said that all my friend knew
the cashier at Sports Authority and he's
like you're lucky get that I know your
friends and I was like why and he pulls
out this coupon and it gives me 15% off
everything
I'm just like like it brought my total
down $60 I think I was like thank you I
