to be doing freshman advice because if
you are not aware I'm going into my
sophomore year which means I was a
freshman last year and personally I went
to a really small private school for
elementary lower and middle school and
then for high school I went to a public
school it was a big deal for me just cuz
I don't know I was out of school for my
whole life the same people and then I
went to a completely different school
for high school and I knew absolutely
nobody and that was probably the most
terrifying part but anyways I just
wanted to let you guys know that that
was my experience and I can talk about
it so I wrote down a phone a couple
pieces of advice for you guys that I
wish I had known kind of / learned by
going high school trying to make an
impression but also be yourself on the
first day of school don't let your ego
be too huge or too small don't just be
sitting in a corner like scared to talk
to people because I know I almost did
that but you know I had to stay away
from that and also don't be like going
around thinking that like you're best
friends with everyone because I could
get off your nerves I don't know like I
want to tell you not to do things in or
to do things but pretty much you got to
like be yourself but my biggest piece of
advice would probably just to be
yourself because that's the only way
that you're going to find your right
group of friends and it's just not going
to be fun putting on a different face
everyday going to school and just
pretending to be someone you're not it's
just going to get old and you're not
going to like it
so I would definitely suggest starting
the school year as yourself and ending
it as yourself to just please make sure
to be yourself because that's just
that's just how you're going to have the
most fun in high school if you be true
to yourself it's just gonna have the
most fun and it's just you know that's
just I want us effing in high school so
remember yourself secure yourself also
personally for me this didn't really
affect me that much but for other people
that you're going to high school with
with all your friends from middle school
um don't be afraid to make new friends I
know that a lot of my
friends that we're friends middle school
like have stuck together and are still
friends but they also branched out and
make new friends you know so don't be
afraid to make new friends because you
don't have to be obligated to like one
group of people either also a great way
to meet new people and make new friends
is to join clubs or sports I know a big
thing for me with sports
when I joined basketball I met a lot of
new people and people that I'm still
friends with to this day and also in
track and also like clubs gives you that
opportunity or just kind of anything
that like you can get involved in in the
school that honestly gives you one of
the best advantages of meeting people
that you could become friends with
because you're sharing a common interest
if you have anything you love try to do
it at your school and then you'll
probably meet people that also love that
and then maybe you guys will become
friends and stuff also in the first
couple days of school don't seek
attention like don't feel bad if you
don't get a lot of attention because I
know in the first days of school you
know not everyone was coming up to me
like hi I'm this person and this person
and that doesn't mean that you're not
most people are kind of shy and the
first couple days of school so don't be
sad and not everyone is reaching out to
you like that's a normal thing people
are scared sometimes to you know take
chances and introduced himself and
things like that but also you could be
one of those people that goes up someone
and says like hi I'm Mel nice to meet
you what's your name or like now I like
your outfit or something and then it can
spark conversation and you know you
don't know where that would end up so
just little things that you could do on
the first couple days of school could
make the biggest difference a big piece
of advice for you guys is balance your
social life and your schoolwork to I
know I'm gonna run people that put 100
percent in one of the things like 100
percent to their social life and then
not that much into their schoolwork or a
hundred another score and then they
barely have a social life
so I think that if you find the balance
like which is hard and will definitely
take some time to learn like I know from
me that you know I couldn't hang out
with people every single day after
school because then I couldn't get my
homework done and also I had sports so
that was just like way too much to you
know do that but also like on weekends
if I do my homework
in the day and then hangout friends
later that works and that worked for me
and there's things that like you have to
find your balance and like what you can
do to make everything I work out and not
put too much stress on yourself either
because if like you're really stressing
on scored and then and your friends
things like it's just going to be too
much stress sometimes you're gonna have
to pick between one or the other like
you have a project do but then your
friends want to go to the beach it's
like what what's gonna affect me later
on by doing this decision like what this
isn't like I do there's gonna be some
tough situations that you're gonna be in
with school and social life but when you
find your balance it's gonna feel great
and you'll know what you can do and what
you can't do and also don't be afraid to
say no if someone asks you to hang out
or sit with them at lunch don't be like
I'm like no no thanks even if they're
not you think the group of friends that
you're gonna stay with forever you don't
know where that might lead so this one
girl invited me on the first day of
school to sit with her friends at lunch
and I did even though now I'm not best
friends with all of them on anything it
was so nice like I had somewhere to sit
you know the first second day school and
I met new people in that way and then
they introduced me to their friends and
it was like even though if you're not
sure about saying yes or no like try to
say yes sometimes refresh you to hang
outside of school and you're nervous
because like you really don't know how
you guys are gonna mix you don't know
where it could end up and if it's not
fun or anything you just don't have to
do it again you know so don't be afraid
to say yes and take some chances
so also try to make other kids feel
welcome I know that her first day school
I was like pretty terrified because I
knew no one walking in I was just in
there and I was like okay like I don't
know anyone so like okay Wow so so try
making an impression on the first cup
that you school personally on the first
couple days I was a little bit more calm
and collected and I was just kind of
like you know being pretty nice to make
a good impression things like that and
then once I got more comfortable with my
classes I became more goofy so like
allow yourself to kind of be chill in
the first couple days of school but then
like once you get more comfortable by
the end of school my entire class and I
we were just like the goofiest you get
more comfortable with the people as it
goes on don't like try too hard you know
just try to like be yourself but also
just keep it cool and collected
you know you know what I'm saying so I
know that the first couple days of
school can be like really you know kind
of scary and like whatever but you
honestly just it's all a mindset to you
got to go and think in like good
thoughts like it's gonna be good like my
school is gonna be fun I'm gonna like it
honestly I'm gonna be honest I did not
have that mindset at all when I went
into the school just because I didn't
really know this school at all I mean I
walked in and I was like oh my god is
going to be terrible i blah but honestly
like I love it now so I kind of wished
that if I could I mean in a way I didn't
get my hopes up too high which is always
good because I hate when I get my hopes
up too high and then it's just like you
know like I don't like that so don't try
to get your hopes up too high like oh my
god like this is gonna be amazing like
click it's good to like think of
thoughts and things but also don't be
like this is gonna be a terrible place
like I'm gonna hate this you know try to
try to have a good in-between just go in
radiating good vibes I don't know like
high school it's a big deal you know to
be stuff in your life but also it's so
fun like you guys are gonna have so much
fun at like football games and
basketball games and dances just think
about like it's gonna be okay you're
gonna find your group of people a couple
people have told me that it takes two
months to settle in some people told me
two weeks some people told me like half
a semester I personally at the beginning
of the school year had a completely
different group of friends than I do now
and I think that everything like you're
gonna it's going to take time to find
your group of people but you're going to
find your group of people and I know
that you might think that your first
group of friends are the people that
you're going to stay with for the rest
of high school but that's not
necessarily the case it wasn't for me it
might be for some people but for most
people for that it isn't you're gonna
end up finding your group one way or
another you're gonna end up finding the
people that you will connect really well
with I don't know
it's just it's gonna be all right yeah
and I mean people change people are
going to change if you have some friends
honestly let some friends you're going
to change and you might not end up
wanting to be friends with them anymore
just because of the way they've changed
it like that's okay because I don't hard
at the time but you need to surround
yourself with people
make you feel happy and if you have a
close friend that's just not doing that
for you anymore like you can't be afraid
to like let go of them you know I know
that's like that's a whole different
topic but you might experience the after
high school you know you never know but
yeah if you guys have any other
questions I got an answer you can hit me
up through Twitter or Instagram and I'd
love to answer them for you guys if you
guys want me to do a separate video and
like friends or dances or boys or
