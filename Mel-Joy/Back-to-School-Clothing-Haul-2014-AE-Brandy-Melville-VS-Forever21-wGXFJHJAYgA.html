back to school haul I did purchase some
of these things cause I did purchase
some of these things during a summer
time I did purchase some of these things
for the summer time in this summer time
but most of it is just for
back-to-school let's get started so the
first place I went was American Eagle I
literally have no jeans that fit me
because I grew about 5 inches in the
past year you know all of my jeans are
like a couple inches above my ankle and
it's super weird placing so I definitely
needed to pick up some more jeans an
American Eagle was having some really
good sales so I got like four pairs of
jeans I believe they were so cheap it
was crazy so the first year I got more
these high-waisted just kinda go over
wash
except the only thing about these is
that they're humongous bell-bottoms
but don't worry I'm not gonna keep them
I'm gonna cut them and make them into
Capri so it'll be high-waisted capris
but I just like love the like the color
so I couldn't pass up the opportunity
like I just couldn't
these were $10 and they are the highrise
artist super dark jeans and they're
super stretchy and comfortable and
that's why I love American Eagle jeans
the next pair that I got were these
really light wash jeans with some rips
in them
the leg or not there's not too many reps
but they're just light wash and they're
skinny
we're not like super skinny and they are
the skinny jeans they're low-rise not
high-waisted but they're still like
pretty stretchy and they're so
comfortable and these were I think like
$15 and then this pair is a pair of
capris they're just this dark wash
straight regular jeans I mean I not
actually compress with the rolled up
right now to become freeze but they're
just dark wash they're kind of actually
kind of high-waisted I've been looking
for like high-waisted jeans for the
longest time and I finally found a lot
on sale these are also $10 all of these
were originally about $50 so I mean I
got a really good deal last pair of
jeans from Matthew Google are he's in a
dark wash with some light patches it
gets lighter kind of on the legs their
high-rise jeggings so they're stretchy
and they're high rise and they're just
skinny at the bottom and I love these so
much of these were probably my favorite
pair of jeans that I got I always said
they look so cute on and love the fit of
them and these were I think $10 also so
that was a great deal so I got one more
pair of jeans slash pants not for
American Eagle I actually got these from
love culture I believe they don't have
that where I live but where I was they
had them and I've been looking for jeans
like this for so long or similar to the
American Apparel high-waisted pants
because they have you know the button
right here that's American
Carroll has and they're just black
skinny jeans and they're super
high-waisted it's so cute you can wear
them with like the shirt off like right
now or pretty much anything and I like
it how they're black they also have
white and like really light Jean
material they only had like my side in
this one I wanted black so I'm really
happy that they had this and these were
I think $27 more on the pricey side I've
been wanting those for the longest time
so I just like I couldn't not get them
and I just I love them the next place I
went to was H&amp;amp;M the first thing I got
was just this wrought tank top and I'm
not planning to wear this by itself
because the cut of it is kind of weird
symbols like boop boop it was 295 and
this is just for like crop shirts that I
have so I from are like high-waisted
something with a see-through top I can
just wear this and it won't go longer
than the shirt will the next thing I got
from H&amp;amp;M I think it's so cute I've got a
baseball tee for really long time this
is not exactly what I was looking for
but it is just a cropped gray sleeves
it's like heather gray up here it just
has a white pocket and it's propped and
I think it looks so cute on I actually
wear these with them pants from up
culture the black I wasted ones and it
looked so cute and this is just it's
small and this was like 595
so it was very portable and very cute so
the next place I went to was forever 21
I actually went in like two different
states like my scene somewhere else I
mean I collected a lot over that time I
didn't get it on one trip so the first
thing I got were these loose floral
they're supposed to be you know like
look like at the brandy melville shorts
and I just think they're so cute they
have little ruffles at the bottom I like
to get a bigger size in these because I
like to miss it on my waist I like them
to go longer so they're like appropriate
to wear out because I know some people
say the brandy melville shorts are like
so short and see-through but these are
not see-through with our good length I
think these are in a large yeah because
it just kinda like them big even though
it's like a little loose I also picked
up these shorts the exact same style but
they're just slack in white floral I
think they're so cute they're so
comfortable you don't even know and
these are just so cute to wear like at
home when you're not doing anything when
you're just chilling with your friend
and those were each $10 these are black
shorts from forever 21 also same sizes
the rest ruffles at the bottom but these
have a tie which is really helpful
because since they're larger than what
you know kind of fits me they like fit
on my waist fine but when I want to are
them high-waisted I can just tie them
really tight and they stay so these were
1380 I got these black high-waisted
shorts these were door teaming dollars
so pretty cheap for high waisted shorts
I've worn them a lot so that's why I
kind of came out wrinkly I also got
these a dark blue denim color but I
can't find those I think they're in the
wash and I love the fit of those these
will still fit me as well they're a
little
sir but when I don't want to you know
wear tight shorts these are always there
which is helpful I got this starting to
wrinkly ignore all the bills it's like
this periwinkle blue color and it has
the super cute kind of lace crochet
details at the bottom they didn't have a
small we just got a medium
I mean if it's pretty good I still
really like it and still really cute
with like high-waisted pants shorts it's
like the perfect length for that and
this was I think about just like $13 so
the next thing I got was this super cute
black and white striped toss was 680
it's cropped a little bit halter I'm not
super halter it's just black and white
and I think this is super cute so I'm
really happy I picked that up so the
next thing I got from forever 21
um it's black and white floral it has
like these little lines on it which I
think's really cute I just got it in a
small 1580 it's like a little cropped
but not super croc so you can still wear
with like normal jeans and stuff and
it's super soft and super comfortable
the next thing I got is from TJ Maxx
this was kind of branching out of my
comfort level like what I saw them love
you know I could be cute and I tried it
on and I actually really liked it it
says tank top with like a ton of
different prints I mean it's pretty cute
I think it lucky with just like black
pants and a cardigan number 999 so the
next place is Hollister I got one thing
at Hollister I just got this navy blue
t-shirt with a pocket here this is so
comfortable that just ties up here
and just a pocket and it's kind of like
faded dark blue heathered you know
material and it is so comfortable and I
think it looks so cute I love it I love
it kind of it so I also don't have the
store near me but it's called route 21 I
just got these white overalls pockets
here than just white and I really like
them they're cute I mean I really wanted
a pair of white overalls and they were
me dollars I believe so I went to the
betray secret outlet which I don't have
near me so really excited about this
thing they're having a really good sale
first thing I got was this black
sweatshirt type thing it's so soft and
it's just black Kansas's pink here
nothing on the back of the hood I really
like it and it's super soft I mean this
was $12
usually like 40 really glad that I got
that deal the next thing is more for
like but wintertime but is this really
oversized cash Christmas sweater
it just has snowflakes and it says pink
with cards and like birds and like some
tribal print things and the only side
that left was a large it's so fricking
comfortable even though it's huge this
could be like really cute just like
leggings and I could just sit around in
it or head to places usually 4950 on
sale for $20 I believe I've been looking
for an oversize Christmasy sweater so
I'm so happy I picked this up I got one
more thing I'm Tory secret outlet get
off this swimsuit it's just it's really
pretty
minty aquamarine color like Scotty
cobalt blue trimming and
and the holes here ties in the middle oh
but I just think this is so cute it
looks really cute on isn't a 34c which
is arsenic pretty big but I just like
coverage I think and this is $12 which
is amazing because this is usually like
30 or 40 dollars I was talking about
that so the last place I went to was
brandy melville and I think that two
things actually picked up three things
but one of the things I didn't really
like how it fit so I turned it first
thing I got is I'm wearing it right now
actually a gray halter top and that's a
little thing in the back it's so
comfortable
oh this was 11 dollars and then the next
thing I got was this top it's just a
blue and white striped shirt with navy
blue trimming on the sleeves and on the
neck I think it looks so cute this was
$20 it is such a John go but that's like
breaking up what it says it is like
small it's so comfortable I love their
fabric that they have a brandy melville
is just like you're wearing a cloud like
it's so comfortable and that is
everything god of this school year and
