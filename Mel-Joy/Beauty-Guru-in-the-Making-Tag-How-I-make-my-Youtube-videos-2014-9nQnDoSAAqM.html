beauty guru in the making tag
I was not tagged in this video but I saw
it and I thought I should do it because
I have a beauty cure in the making so
there's 13 questions so let's get
started so the first question is what
camera do you use
so I use the Canon 70d it is a DSLR
camera it looks like like that it looks
like that and I love this camera has a
viewfinder so I can see my so I can see
myself to make sure I'm in the frame and
I really like this camera so far yeah do
you do special makeup or hair before
filming I try to film videos the days
where I was already dressed up a little
bit more and already wearing more makeup
like right now I'm wearing more makeup
cause it's cool but on the weekends when
I don't want to put on makeup I just
want our Mac Jana's I'm here don't film
video so it's not like I do certain
makeup and stuff for videos it's more
like why I have makeup on I film the
video if that makes any sense I hate but
I'll make up what I don't need to
because it's not for your face do you
see your room or just the area people
see so if I am filming a certain place
and it is terrible mess buying me I'll
either put like a blanket over it or
I'll try to clean it up or I'll just
like no spaces but I try to make the
background look it's a neat as possible
like I like just a white background so
yeah number four are you wearing real
pants or yoga pants pajamas etc right
now Thank You Amma
pants and flip the flippers and slippers
I almost never wear like real pants when
I'm filming a video because I'll either
be just came from school and I want to
take off my tight jeans will put on my
pajama pants or sub pants
I'll film like that they don't see your
bottom half what's the point would
usually wear pajama pants
number five natural light or studio
lighting system so I use a natural
lighting inspect element from a window
right now actually I just find the
biggest red dollar me because natural
lighting I think I mean it's better I
would love love love to have to kneel
inning because then I could film at
nighttime or whenever I wanted to and
wherever I wanted to I think if like my
YouTube gets more serious then I'll
purchase some studio lighting do you
feel did you feel awkward talking to a
camera when I'm home alone I don't feel
awkward at all because I don't I just
don't under - when I have like my family
on me I try to be like Mike you're
talking to a camera but you're also
talking to people - cuz it's like you're
watching me oh hi hi I'm Mel
nice to meet you tried it you know it's
weird but I like it you know don't say
like it's fun to film a video because
you just sit down and talk hello
but if somebody saw me on the street
they probably like would you do do you
like filming outside or inside
I tried filming outside once it's my
middle school advice video I think it
was so windy I it was hard to hear me I
think I like to film inside because the
audio quality will be better but I think
it's so pretty outside
I just wish do you edit your bloopers
out or just sleep in them in I
definitely definitely have to edit my
videos because if I just loved my video
like run through there'd be so many
unnecessary like breaths and just like
not talking or mispronouncing words and
nobody would want to watch that I use
Final Cut Pro X to edit
and I really like it there's just so
many necessary things in my videos that
they take out number 9
do you like filming at night or during
the day personally the day because I
have my lighting you know and my legs I
wouldn't have a video but if I had
studio lighting
I would love to film in the night
because those nights where you're up
till 3:00 you don't have nothing to do
it's like videos you know but I have to
film during the day to get lighting like
this yeah how long does it take you to
get ready for the video 30 seconds
cuz I set up my tripod or I make the
tripod out of something and I put my
camera on it I make sure my makeup looks
ok no I've had a few videos where my
eyebrow hairs are like button or if I
work really early officer powder on or
my hairs like I'll fix that but like
right now today I just put my SD card at
my camera's editing put it on the stand
and they sat down and here we are so it
depends what video filming my efforts of
the week that was harder because I go
outside and really it's just a tripod in
a ton of different areas of I might
change outfits so that it depends on
video how long does it take you to edit
depending the video and how much I
screwed around in that video if I just
sit down the edited video it could be
like 30 minutes but if I do it like
overtime
all on my videos I'll feel like a long
time before I need to actually post it
you know like a week or two so I'll just
spend a little bit of each day editing
like whatever on board or whatever but
depending the video like one of my
videos would be like an hour and it just
goes to be screwed on so much good news
was my friend the best friend that and
then somewhere I'm more serious
he's me less because I have less time of
me like but depending within like the
news where you have a ton a ton a ton of
time film like yeah I'll just feel like
a ton and then I'll put in whatever part
I want to like that fits a
that's one with five minutes for each
outfit night ended up putting in 30
seconds for each outfit
so I'd really put that down and figure
out what things you want to put in yeah
it depends the video number 12 what is
your favorite video I really like
sit-down videos because they're like
talking to you guys and I like filming
halls times are fun because you had some
questions and I also like doing reviews
because then I get to share with you
guys when I think of it and if you
should get it or not I have a lot of
things to review you know but I like
annexing every video in general okay
number 13 what's the longest video takes
you something the longest video so far
that's taking me to film it's definitely
that the week video because I did all of
my outfits in one day is I was super
busy during the weeks like after school
I don't have time for much for school so
on Friday I just put all the outfits on
it I went outside a night position the
tripod ensued me and do all those close
up sets full body shots and that took me
like a long time to film inside outfits
that seems like a long time I just I
never made one of those videos before so
I didn't know how much footage I was
gonna need you know I'm saying something
also the prank called challenge which
you guys have not seen yet I took us a
really long time because we had to wait
for the people to like bring like call
them so we'd like an hour you should
have probably stopped the camera out of
the bed if someone picked up orders on
the Google to be carefu yeah thank you
