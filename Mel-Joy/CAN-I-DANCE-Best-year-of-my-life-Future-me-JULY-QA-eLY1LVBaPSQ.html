the people I love or I'm doing something
that I love if it's with my friends or
my family or I'm filming a YouTube video
or I'm watching Netflix chilling in my
bed it really depends like what mood I'm
in and what day it is but mostly my
friends and family make me happy and
also when I see my friends and family
like happier when I make someone happy
it makes me happy so Allie darkness
asked what has been the best year of
your life and why is a really hard
question because I don't even know
because every year has up and downs for
me personally but honestly probably this
year freshman year 2015 it's when I
really started my YouTube channel and it
started growing and I made a lot of new
friends in high school because I came
alone so I was really scared I wasn't
gonna make any friends but I made a lot
of really great friends and I know High
School's really cool like I was really
scared for it but it's fun oh no so
probably this year I think I don't know
it's a really hard question because like
I'm really happy at times but
I'll have my time there I'm sad every
year it's not like one year I'm just
happy throughout the whole year but this
year I think I had the most happy
memories or eighth grade at my old
school so like last year thousand that
was a lot of great memories there too so
