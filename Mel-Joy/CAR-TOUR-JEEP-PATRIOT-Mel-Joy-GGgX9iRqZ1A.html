video is going to be one of my most
suggested videos ever and it is a car
tour I have a Jeep Patriot in a white
year 2015 I'm just going to show you
guys what I keep in my car what features
my car has really quickly sorry about
the Sun through blocker no way kid
before I get started in this video sorry
if it's crooked or anything but I just
wanted to say that I bought this car
with my own money I saved up for it is
my dream car I wanted it for so long I
bought it used but it's only about a
year old when I bought it it wasn't even
a year old yet it was a rental car so it
was in great condition because they had
to keep it in good condition I did buy
it with 23,000 miles on it which is not
bad at all
and I got it for a really good deal it
was like the only Jeep at this retailer
they didn't really want it I got a
freighter deal which I was very happy
about I love this car so much I have
really no complaints about it except for
one thing there are some blind spots if
you guys are thinking about getting this
car that's like the only thing not super
happy about but I love everything else
about this car I love the way it drives
I don't know it's just a great car
overall sounds really quickly wanted to
tell you guys kind of the deep about my
car by the way
my car's name is scout I don't know I've
always wanted to name something scout I
was gonna name my dog scout but my
family didn't agree with me
so I named my car it is really hot sorry
if I look sweaty or gross or anything
I hope you guys enjoy this video and if
you want to see what's in my car and
what my car is like stay tuned and keep
watching so when you first see my car
this
what the side looks like it is all white
with black detailing and it says Patriot
right here in silver letters so you know
it's a patriot I just have the regular
Jeep tires that came with it I didn't
get new or fancy ones or anything like
that though this is what the slide looks
like this is the back door it seats five
it is a five-seater I have my gas thing
this is the roof rack I have not used
this but you can put luggage in a
surfboard or whatever on their back the
trunk just opens like so I'll go further
into it later but antenna so I can
listen to the video yeah this is what
the outside looks like I really like it
so i'ma show you the inside now oh and
enjoy the front over the front covering
up high license plate it says G right
here and silver it has a typical Jeep
front at all
jeeps have the lights the high beams is
plastic the bumper so yeah
first enter my car like so I'm just
going to talk about all the features and
the this is a steering wheel just says
Jeep on it I'm going to show you my horn
my friends make fun of me because it's
like so I don't know like high-pitched
ready her not the most intimidating horn
but you know it works for me with my
steering wheel I have my keys it just
looks like this I'm like of course
keychain and then the keys and my house
keys and everything this is the sound
system audio sector area this is where
you can play radio I disc aux which is
my personal favorite this is my auto
part right here if you're wondering it's
from Belkin plays my music this is my
charger just right here up here I have
my mirror I had a daisy chain but it's
pretty much dead now and I also used to
have some beads up there but they broke
so I wanted something there I'm going to
figure that out here you know the
typical car stuff they have the
emergency brake which I pretty much
always have on when I park I don't know
why I just in case I have my fries
Hawaiian sent thing I love that set
that's my favorite set here I have this
cool thing that you put in here and it
will hold your phone you're going
somewhere want directions and you don't
want to be looking at your phone because
that's unsafe you can use this from from
Kia so use that and then in here I just
have paperwork and my manual my license
and registration in there and insurance
all that good stuff here I have my purse
a lot of this stuff like my necessities
are in here if you guys want to see it
but what's in my first video comment
down below or like this video because a
lot of the stuff that would like be in
my car is in here because I like to take
it with me places you know and then here
I have my coffee because I am a big
coffee drinker so I will most likely
have some sort of coffee or refreshment
in my car now it's just my coffee and
here I just have the cup holders and
then in this one I just keep my
headphones a chapstick this is my US
summer fruit and then I have some
Hershey's
but kisses what do I have here oh I have
a fortune in this little thing it says
remember three months from the state
good things aren't so I don't remember
when that day was but in this little
area here
I just keep some quarters and then some
bobby pins for emergency for my hair and
then in this compartment it's like
double you have the big one in that
small one and the small one I keep my
adkins chocolate-chip granola bar
because I always like to have a snack in
case I'm on the go and I'm hungry I love
these these are so good then I have mint
gum this is the polar ice gone by
Eclipse and I just have that I'm a huge
gum chewers so I always have them done
with me I always want to have a mint and
then a fruity one this is the Trident
black raspberry twist I have that too
and then my friends bobbin is juicy
fruit one and I have another lip balm
this is the lip butter vanilla and
macadamia kiss by Nivea I just have a
pen and a pencil you know case I ever
need to write anything down I have this
mini charger which goes with this I can
plug it in here and then charge your
phone but I'm using that I'll use this
with it and that is all I keep in this
one so the next thing is this like
bigger compartment the first thing I
have in here I have this Duracell outlet
thing and you can put this in the here
and then it's like if you're going on a
road trip or something there's two USB
for like your phones and then to actual
outlet things for like my computer or
anything like that
it's a converter so it's just really
helpful or going on long car rides the
next thing I have is all baggy just for
girl stuff if you know what I'm saying
so in case for emergencies the next
thing is a fragrance mist this is a body
mist from Bath Body Works and pink
chiffon she's ever if I'm on the go and
I forget body mists or
from the gym or something I can just do
a spritz of this on me and I will smell
better I have some lotion this is a
sweet pea body lotion just you know
moisturize my hands on my body on the go
and then the next thing I have is some
sunscreen by Neutrogena and this is if
I'm ever outside and I don't want to
burn so I have this I also have a hand
sanitizer this is also sweetpea backup
aux cord literally a three dollar one I
got at a electronic store a flashlight
this is like a heavy-duty flashlight if
I'm ever stuck somewhere it's dark I'll
have this and then I have some benadryl
and some Advil I have really bad
allergies so these are just the benadryl
like for allergy I have allergies I'll
have this and then this is advil I'm
ever having pains or something and then
another thing if I don't have my purse
with me what I always need to have is my
wallet this is just my Kate Spade wallet
but a tip for you guys never leave
really expensive things in your car when
you're not there so I make sure to bring
this with me everywhere so I have this
and that just has my license and
everything
the next thing are my sunglasses these
are my ray-bans I also don't leave this
unattended in my car because I like them
too much they look like this they're the
Ray Ban polarized aviators so I've set
these
if it's sunny so I keep those things in
there unless I have my purse and then
the next thing which I would definitely
recommend any drivers out there if you
don't do this I keep a little coin bag
bags just remove lemon but I keep points
for if I have parking meters that I have
to fill up helpful to have with you when
you're on the road that's everything in
there I actually also keep a mini
deodorant in here but I don't know where
it went so I should go get a new one
because those are super important to
have so that is what is in this little
compartment area this is just like a
flat area I guess I keep a little
crystal I don't know why because it's
cute nice vibe to it I also have another
backup box in here that my friend gave
me as you can see locks is very
important to me that is pretty much
everything that I keep in this part of
my car so now I'm just going to show you
the back seat really quickly and then
i'ma show you the trunk
so when you open backseat gamer it just
looks like this I don't really keep
anything back here there's a lot of like
storage things throughout my car though
like down here and stuff main thing I
keep is a box of tissues it looks like
really smushed but I like I said have
allergies or if I'm sick or anything I'd
like to have these my interior is just
all black with like silver detailing so
yeah that's my back seat and then this
is my trunk I have a little Fang Rican
you know hide your stuff this didn't
come with my card oh I had to purchase
this separately I have a it flashlight
kit my parents bought me this for
Christmas one of the flashlights is up
there the smallest one like I just
showed but these are like really big
really heavy duty ones it comes with
batteries so if I'm ever I don't know in
an emergency this is nice to have so I
just have that
here who have this to check my tire
pressure I don't really know how to use
it but I got from my dad so I also have
my Febreze vent clips that I have up
there in case it runs out I can just pop
another one into my car smells nice in
here is my extra tire it's came with the
car it comes with Jeeps or never so just
have that this is just out here so that
is everything in my truck not very
exciting these are my speakers I
personally bought louder and better
quality speakers for my car just because
I listen to music and I really enjoy
music I upgraded my speakers so these
aren't the speakers that the car comes
with this is just a lock and unlock the
car so now I'm going to just tell you
thumb on my speakers just to show you
guys the audio quality and I will list
speakers that I got down below in the
description box I'm just gonna play
music through awk that's what I usually
do
starting my car that you can see as a
phone on her window back to donate into
told you you was just busy it gets
pretty loud that's an example of my
speakers here is all my little gadget
thingies this is how many miles is on it
it's 26,000 miles 503 little things that
you can use here that's cruise control
this is how you control your side view
mirrors kinda like a video game so

everything in my car yeah so thank you
