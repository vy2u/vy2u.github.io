couple different recipes that we could
try out from this box go one too right
we have the recipes here so the first
one is pan-seared pork tomato garlic

chopped chicken salad alright we're
gonna be a chopped chicken salad we both
really like salads and you know it's
healthy and gotta get that summer broad
because summers right on the printer if
you guys are wondering what this is
because like what is it it is a packaged
meal from hellofresh I'm working with
hellofresh
to show you guys kind of what they do
and what they are and things like that
try out one of their recipes but
hellofresh is pretty much a company that
sends you guys like packaged meals like
I just showed you guys there were three
in this one comes with all the
ingredients necessary to make a meal
it's supposed to take 30 minutes or
under has the right quantities and the
right everything so you don't have to
you know like measure it or whatever
like everything you need is here so this
I think is perfect for anyone who's a
beginner cook or a an amazing
professional cook just because
everything is already here for you
alright what's in the box in here those
chicken romaine lettuce red bell pepper
red onion lime avocado cilantro sour
cream roma tomato Southwest spice bun
cumin and oregano we're gonna be like
like did it chopping that what are those
called cutting boards right right and
like some knives maybe ya know you got
me got me but is in the frame thank you
I'm gonna put them ah if my nose is
right I'm sorry allergy season you know
just part of that time so we already
washed our hands and we are ready to
cook this is going to be on all over the
place video step 1 prep the veggie split
but wet prep the veggies wash and dry
all produce we have a sink right here
you preheat the oven to 400 degrees
while I mom is putting on the oven I'm
going to half peel and slice the onion
into wedges is this the thing that makes
you cry oh so if you cut this part off
it makes you cry if you cut it in half
light light and while I do this can you
core seed and thinly slice the bell
pepper compost so wedges would be this
way so I am good at private trick for
peppers if you cut the sides now you can
cut it around the core and then you
don't have so much seeds to deal with
we're not applying all these wedges the
peppers tasty I never allow direct me to
do again
no need to be interference Hey yeah
pretty much
also I forgot to tell you guys oh my
gosh well I'm crying I promise coke for
you guys if you guys want to get $35 off

description box to go to hello fresh
calm and use my promo code Mel Joey Mel
joy promo code woo toss the peppers and
onions on a baking sheet with a large
drizzle of olive oil olive oil
why does your onions look so much better
than mine what so I just did thin slices
and cut them you kind of get chopped but
it's okay toss the peppers and onions on
baking sheet with a drizzle and a season
of salt and pepper and then place it in
the oven for 20 minutes and wow I'm
still crying so now I'm supposed to sear
the chicken Southwest spice blend cumin
and oregano these are the these right
heat and drizzle the olive oil in a
large pan over high heat to see the
chicken for 2 to 3 minutes so I'm gonna
do this over the sink and while she does
that I will do prepping the remaining
ingredients pour and slice the tomato am
I doing this right let's hope hi
so I'm going to slice the tomato into
pieces okay make the avocado Langa whoo
pick the cilantro leaves would be
picking the leaves through the chicken
I'm gonna put the oregano and
there on the rim and pit the avocado I
don't know why I just love cutting a
thousand of our best cuts I've ever done
I'm gonna be honest pivot so don't you
like stab it yeah yeah oh I broke the
pit I'm going to cube them cubed and the
chicken is pan searing each time okay oh
I get on the pot on my face I cubes the
avocado and I'm going to now wash my
hands can you hear the chicken so I feel
like I'm yelling my nose it's cool so
resisting the line I'm placing the
cilantro stems in the bowl they're
supposed to be cut up so I'm cutting
them up now I'm gonna get this kitchen
is gonna be whatever's in that okay who
needs five walls right when you could be
cooking I'm kidding
stay in school slice the romaine lettuce
into half-inch pieces and place in a
large bowl all right we're not going to
slice so we're just gonna rip it that
way the cells and the lettuce don't
Brown out the way they do in prep clean
it with a knife
cooking hands nice fresh lettuce we did
the lettuce opinion toasting the line
never existed before
maybe about the wives s place not the
avocado with the lime zest the cilantro
stems and the juice of half a lime okay
oh it looks so pretty do the spacing mix
together with a fork and I just like
squeeze it yeah that's just more
effective to mix 1 tablespoon of sour
cream so here's the sour cream we're
getting the tablespoon and I'm going to
mash the avocado then we're supposed to
heat the broiler to high or the oven to
500 degrees cook the chicken and veggies
for an additional 2 to 5 minutes until
they are slightly charred so now I'm
mixing the avocado the lime the lime
and the sour cream into the little sauce
dressing that's the word little pepper a
little pepper and why not so we just
throw all this in that can go in the
compost my camera bag but I just put
everything put all the tomatoes of it
you've got to be kidding I put all the
avocado the dressing the tomatoes
cilantro all that stuff in here and now
we're putting the charred vegetables so
it's really good
forgot couple and now I'm gonna mix
those in as well we're mixing it's
