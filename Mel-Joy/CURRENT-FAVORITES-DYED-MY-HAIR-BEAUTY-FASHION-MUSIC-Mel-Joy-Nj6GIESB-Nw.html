my god boys mmm oh my god it's okay
oh hello my beautiful Meza if you can
tell um look a little different I
decided to dye my hair brown I have been
wanting to do this for maybe five years
I don't know I never had the guts to do
it and I said I knew you knew me i'ma do
what I want
no kidding but I literally went for it
was such an impulsive decision I decided
like one morning I was like you know
what I'm gonna dye my hair I called they
had an appointment at 2:00 I was like
all right we're doing it you're
wondering like what exactly they did
they kept my natural hair which was like
the blondish dark blonde I don't even
know and they kept that as like the
highlights and then just dye the rest
dark and also I have to like dye around
my face if you're wondering if I just
really badly contoured I didn't or I
hope I didn't but I have like a little
brown spots from the dye if you notice
that I'm sorry it really bothers me but
hopefully doesn't bother you if you
don't my channel hello my name is Mel it
is great to you I would really
appreciate it if you would subscribe
would make my heart really happy you
already know today's video is just going
to be my current favorites I was going
to do like a January February favorites
but I kind of it's like both time gaps
to upload it and I have not sat down and
film the video and so long I missed it
also something with my hair it's just
cause like I'm really I'm not used to it
but I really like it if you don't like
it I'm sorry but are you wearing it
everyday
no I I just have some cram favorites I'm
gonna share with you guys that I've been
loving so let's just get started let's
do it also starts with a boring
background again it's lame but I'm
working on some in the background for
you guys so just stay tuned you feel me
I'm going to start with Beauty going on
so the first thing that I have been
completely obsessed with shout out to
love you on my best friend I love you
thank you for getting me on this it is
the it cosmetics CC cream this stuff is
so good it literally has the coverage of
a fun day
I'm not even joking so many people on a
daily ask me what I use for foundation
foundation and I use this I have two
shades I have flight and fair in the
fair I have the illumination one which
just I'd like to relate pretty glow but
I've been using light because I want to
come oh when I got a little tangled so
I've been using this one but usually I
mix both of these to get my skin tone
but I'm not tan oh there's 50 plus as
Jansenist so it's like great so the
summer coming up not soon enough
whatever looking at the finder and I
just see my hair like who's that
so then the next thing I'll just keep it
keep it on face so I used to love this
concealer like love and then I just
stopped using it I was using the Too
Faced Born This Way concealer and then I
got on this grind again recently
probably because I just got paler so I
like needed a paler concealer so I whip
this thing out but I started using it
again and I remembered why I liked it so
much and this is just in like two
vanilla it's the radiant creamy
concealer from NARS and I'm obsessed
with this I've been like using less
concealer just because I like the way it
looks but this is like perfect coverage
perfect shade you feel and that's like
bronzer I've been really into like the
cream do we look at our notes I've been
using this dream illuminator and sealer
stick actually from Maybelline but this
is in 60 deep I believe yes so it's like
a bronzer shade for me because I'm pale
but I just like to put this where I
usually bronze and then rub it out with
my Beauty Blender and it just like looks
so natural and just gives you so much of
like a nice like tan I don't know I love
this and then just put on top of that
wow I'm like disgusting this is gross
it's the shade and light palette from
Kat Von D's I got this for Christmas and
I've been using it like every day ever
since I'm obsessed I just mix these two
colors the first in a second one this is
like a cool toned and this is like a
warm toned and I just really like that
makes of both of them together and I'll
do some brushes actually because I've
been getting a lot more into like
brushes and like the techniques of like
what to use them for kind of and loving
these Sigma brushes I have a coat I
believe which I'll put down below
first one is the Sigma blending a 25 and
it is just like I know I really liked it
she liked the crease honestly I just
used like these two or these two every
day really my makeup and like that's all
I need like you can make such a good eye
makeup look like just these two brushes
I'm obsessed
they blend so nicely and then the other
two brushes here are the tapered
blending brushes in the e-40 and the e35
I don't want to know the difference I'm
going to be on him
I think this one no I really just don't
know use them both for the same the same
outcome they just blend amazingly like
really well my eyes shadow I've been
using non-stop since Christmas as well
because I got some super Christmas this
is all so disgusting I'm just going to
take better care of my makeup but this
is the modern renaissance palette from
Anastasia Beverly Hills you guys already
know this is raised about and I can see
why colors are just so flawless and like
oh they blend it so well it's like what
I love love love about it I really have
the miking warm taupe buon fresco blonde
fresco in red okra
there we go and I just like mix all
those and put it in my crease I can do
like the updated makeup tutorial if you
guys delight on my kind of like when I
wear everyday or like when I do stuff
because it's kind of the same just comes
like when I like a look I like to stick
with it and I do it like every day we're
like when I do stuff so I can definitely
do it updated for you guys but I've been
loving this like this is the only
eyeshadow I've touched in like months so
good and then this is a new product that
I was gifted by Mac they send like
little PR packages they're so sweet but
this is the Mac lip scrumptious and it's
like a lip scrub and I used to like the
elf lip scrub I still love it that let's
exfoliator yeah this is cool but I ran
out of it so I just started using this
one and it smells so good it's in
candied nectar so like tastes like fruit
which I'm down for but it exfoliates you
lift so nicely I use this whenever I do
my makeup what was that now just makes
you feel really soft very smooth I just
love the lip exfoliator because I hate
feeling like I'm jealous one of my least
favorite things like you'll see me if
you're working a person you'll see me
apply jessic probably ten times like in
that day I just applied onyx so often
then moving on to like skincare
and with one or two things but the first
thing I've been breaking out recently
and it sucks but it's part of growing up
and stressed and whatever anything to do
with it but something that helps I feel
like is this glam glow mask but this one
is the super mug clearing treatment and
less people look like open hmm
oh okay no no no it looks like this it's
like made with what's it mate let's see
what it's made what is that what's in
here seaweed this little seaweeds in
here I think I'm pretty sure I just
decided to like where I'm breaking out
the most or just my whole face honestly
hey leave it on for like 10 to 20
minutes literally to send oh five 20
minutes I'll feel like a difference
literally after one or two uses it just
really helps you break out a lot but I
think you're only supposed to use it one
to three times per week if you're
wondering and then the next little
skincare favourite has standards yes -
Tomatoes detoxifying charcoal facial
white I'll just use these like sometimes
when I just like feel gross and I don't
like wash my face till I dry it out it's
made with charcoal to detoxify and keep
clean so the next thing is a perfume and
this is definitely a favorite because
you can tell it's completely out this is
a black opium by YSL missus I want to
get it again it's so good like I get
compliments on it all the time like when
you earn each month there's a look so I
really liked it and I used all my
different fashion favorites because I
love fashion
I've gotten so and fashion really
there's a haul coming soon stay tuned
and I you guys always talk about how
much you love my house which is always
we think there have been some staples
that I've just been wearing all the time
all the time the first thing I've gotten
a lot of questions on it's my sunglasses
I got these babies in Cabo and a lot of
people ask me surreal and yes I'm pretty
sure the real I mean I got into like
pretty much a sunglasses felt like
equivalent to the one in Cabo it wasn't
called so I myself but it's like
Cleveland there's like insurance on them
or like protection to them so I feel
like they're legit but they're from
Gucci just like have a little red and
green stripes on the side and just
really like them I like how like big
they are I really like big sunglasses
and
like square like run you look I don't
know I think to them but opposed to
these on Instagram and you guys went
crazy about them so I really like these
big fan big fan let's just throw shoes
because I'm a shoe fanatic as you guys
know I just wrote it and what is I
haven't online shopped in really long
time and I started again which is a
mistake but awesome suit that's all I
gotta say now if I put these in a
favorites video I think I have and
whining is on a daily like on a daily
I've so many shoes and I just go to
these ones but they're just friends all
know like skate skate bands with a
little white stripe I just bought these
with camera on the sides and I'm really
excited about them so you'll see that
enough coming ball but I don't know I
love this style just so versatile you
can literally wear them with anything
and they look dope and almost up and my
last fashion favorite are hoodies as you
guys know but the brand I've been loving
recently shadow middle I have like five
of their hoodies I thank him out they're
just so comfortable and I really like to
style them and whatever I've been
wearing the black one with the lightning
bolts here a losses I've been loving
like the look of lightning bolts and
everything but that one's in the wash so
I'm just going to show this one it's
just the yellow like them you know we
got the hoodies so these are the best
I live in hoodies like actually live
English and now I'm gonna do some music
