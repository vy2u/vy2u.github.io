yeah I'm sweating this way hi remember
hello my beautiful best friend so
today's video is going to be like what
oh because you're trying to use
hana-chan instead of playing but I
remembered so today's video is going to
be like a current favorites slash what
month is it the middle of May favorite
great half my beauty favorites I have
some skincare favorites that's been like
a big thing for me recently some random
favorites you know and if you know my
channel hello what my name is Mel it is
great to meet you I would really
appreciate it if you would subscribe I
FA you know where the button is if I
sound a little sick or if I'm asking a
little sick I woke up and not feeling my
best but I'm pushing through it so I can
film to you guys till yeah just a little
disclaimer so I'm going to start with
some makeup products because I've been
playing around a lot more with makeup
because I've been having some skin
issues or I was my skin's wrong show so
much redder too like thank all for that
some products that I've been using like
every day now you know obsessed with so
the first thing is the Smashbox photo
finish foundation primer and this is the
blue hydrating one I've never actually
tried to like normal one but I've heard
that it's like raised about I would
loves it so I thought I would try the
hydrating one just because my skin is
like naturally very dry and then I put
makeup on it it like literally flakes
off like pieces of my foundation will
fly documents absolutely disgusting I
got a facial which helped a lot if
you're really dry skin out suggest
getting a facial ASAP ASAP rocky since I
dealt with a lot of acne recently the
products that I'm using to get rid of my
acne dried out my face a craft time like
so much so now my skin is doing a lot
better a lot more like hydrated and
stuff but this is my favorite primer to
put under my makeup before I wear this
literally leaves my MicroBot all day it
doesn't flake at all or make my makeup
Slee by the end of the day like you know
you put on makeup in your face you like
tight it just doesn't feel tight
anything I'm obsessed obsessed and then
what I like to do after I put that on my
face is spray some Smashbox photo submit
some photo finish primer water on my
face as you can see
like that out of the stuff because I
love it so much this is my absolute
favorite convo convo this is my absolute
favorite combo if you have like dry skin
so then we'll move on to foundation
because it's appropriate because I just
saw draw primer so the first one is this
Too Faced Born This Way Foundation this
used to be like my Holy Grail favorite
foundation ever I was obsessed with it
and then Olivia introduced me to the CC
cream by it cosmetics which I like
non-stop used but I ran out of it of
course I haven't gone to Sephora to get
new ones so I just have been like trying
my different foundations to see if I
like any of them better or whatever
these two have been my favorites the
Born This Way by Too Faced and fit me
matte and poreless by Maybelline these
refer went out a little bit tanner
if I have a little pen on that I'll use
these but these are just really like a
nice formula they cover up well but like
not too much where you look like cakey
flawless yet not cakey which is like my
all-time favorite look ever so what I
really like about the fitnah one is its
structure it's really affordable and
makes you so mad and I'm someone who is
dry skin but throughout the day I get
oily so this is like perfect because it
covers your pores and everything it's
matte which is feels so nice on the skin
both of these so I'm highly recommend
and if you want to know the shade this
one is in nude and this one right here
125 I have 120 and 125 minutes depending
macaron so I'm someone who like what I
really like a certain like makeup
routine or certain product I like stick
to it so I don't have that many new
Beauty favorites what I'm trying to do
like the next couple of months is really
just branch out and try like other
products I haven't even tried because
who knows I could like them better and I
can share them with you guys so that's
kind of like all the makeup favorites I
have but I do have this brush lastly and
this is from morphe I don't know which
brush this is I'll try to find a link or
something but it's like this big contour
brush and I love it just for like
bronzing up your face so soft and it's
sent this angle it's like perfect for
that contour and I just been using this
every day so yeah so we're gonna do a
couple music favorites if you don't
follow my Spotify and you want to see
the music I listen to it to myself and
mouth with two L's
I like pull up with a stick by sobs Aziz
Oh timeless by ugly whatever be the song
beast gets me so high blasting in the
car like she gotta wait for the drop yes
I love that song so much I'm just going
to do those two keep it simple keep it
short so then going along with like apps
and stuff on my phone I like losing my
voice okay another one of my favorite
apps has been audible I bet you guys
afraid of audible because like who
hasn't it's such a good app she's
literally listening on right now okay if
you didn't know I'm not the biggest
reader I don't love to read but audible
is actually showed oh you can listen
right in the car when you're getting
ready like literally wherever you want
the book that I'm currently listening to
is the Maze Runner I am obsessed with
this book I've seen the movie I've read
the book before I just absolutely love
it and when you use a 30-day trial and
audible a book that you choose and my
purchase for free you can keep
regardless like I still have so many
books from when I use them like middle
school and high school I'm still in high
school I'm a super dope about audible is
you can use it on an Android I pod mp3
tablet whatever you want there's news
comedy the audio version of a book
newspapers magazines broadcasters like
literally everything so if you want to
check out audible and get a 30-day free
trial go to audible.com/smarter
at the very top of the description box
so it'll be very accessible for you guys
and let me know what you guys think
about audible because I love it
especially because I don't like reading
but I like listening to things thank you
so much to audible for sponsoring this
video as the pleasure to work with you
guys to get your awesome so yeah moving
in to skin care more or less I have a
couple products just oh I'm trying to
take care of my skin that was a student
product so the first thing is this
lotion I have a selection for basic like
okay a survey lotion but I wanted to
talk about this because my dermatologist
recommended this to me and I've actually
seen like a pretty big difference my
dermatologist told me not to use oils so
she recommended this one and I've been
trying it and I really like it it's I
think it's water-based so it's like
really good for your skin I'm just super
hydrating and doesn't put the oils in
your skin to cause acne but I think this
along with all the other acne products
I've been using like has been helping so
much I feel so much more confident in my
own skin now so if you want to see a
updated I've actually never done a
skincare routine if you'd like to see
the skincare routine let me know I'll do
it for you guys so then I kind of skin
care product but it is this self tanner
from loving tan
they're like the sweetest over there I
love them I think I have a coupon code
I'm not sure I'll leave it down below to
get a free mint I think this one is this
just looks so nice and natural so many
of you guys have been asking me why I
look so tan in my last videos because
I'm usually very pale but it's because I
use this bad boy and then I feel pain
and I love it moving on is to some hair
favorites as you can tell I have been
dyeing my hair a lot so I'm trying to
take really good care of it because I
don't want it to be damaged and feel
gross that's like I don't want that so
the first thing is this it's a 10
miracle leave-in light and these used to
be all the rave a couple years ago but I
don't know it's had this for a while but
I like rediscovered it and I absolutely
love it after I take a shower on my hair
is damp I just spray it all in
everywhere it smells so good and it like
makes your hair just smell really like
fresh and nice it also detangled your
hair it makes it just like smoother and
shinier and I just I remember like this
I don't know if the lightening maybe
it's just like a lighter formula
probably is but it's a 10 10 out of 10
so then the last hair favorite oh my -
but you know is this a Tuesday could be
saying that so wrong dry shampoo and
this is in tropical this is a coconut
and exotic tropical oh wait I would not
recommend this to someone who has like
really dark hair because it does come
out a little white let's see if I can
show you hold on me might be really cool
ah make it hella cool Draco Malfoy on
your finger looks like I'm minding look
boy oh wait hold on so I really like
this it smells really good but since my
hair is kind of like a lighter when I
put it in it doesn't look as white if I
just spread it around a lot brush it out
it looks very good I need dry shampoo in
my eyes because I just hate touching my
hair
feeling oily that's a no-go so then that
is a really random favorite but it's
this gum
it's starburst by juicy fruit and
strawberry and I know that might sound a
little weird but it's really good and
all my friends love it so whenever I
have it it's not a good one example a
but like I literally got this like
yesterday and there's four pieces left
that's just how much notice five pieces
are Bhalla it's just quite a popular
thing within me and my friends and then
my last fashion favorite no my only fan
favorite shows these in my hall they're
the camel band I'm not going to talk
about these too much because you can see
everything
what are you laughing I do know what my
man is but I'm not in town might be too
much since they were my last video but
they're like my favorite shoes I love
them
so I believe that that's all the favors
I have for this video if you want to see
it more favorites in the future let me
know down below and also just any other
video suggestions you have because you
already know I want to do what you want
to see suppose kind of wrong in a way
because you already know I want to make
the videos that you guys want to see so
stay tuned for our videos I have some
cool ideas in mind so stay tuned for
those I love you guys to infinity and
beyond
I mean it when I say it and I hope you
know that and I hope that you're having
a marvelous running afternoon or night

video compare princess pizza BBC Newark
