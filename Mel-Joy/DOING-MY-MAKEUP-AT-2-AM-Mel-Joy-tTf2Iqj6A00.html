really late right now it's 2:00 a.m. and
I just got my roots done and look right
here is already blonde it's so great I
thought it would be fun to see if I
could do my makeup at 2:00 a.m.
cuz why not this why not I honestly hate
when I'm up so late and I'm so much any
baby yes what the hell ways will stay
with that I live alone in my Oh God do
that in my apartment if I made noise
past 10 o'clock my neighbors below me
would go crazy like walking would piss
them off the noise of walking but now I
have a house so I can be loud and I'm
really excited because that means I can
film videos when I get energy and my
wishes right now so what's that I don't
know why I'm doing my makeup at 2:00
a.m. of all things because I'm not gonna
be using this makeup for anything except
for this video I also just haven't
they're wearing a lot of makeup recently
so I want to see if I still have the
techniques and I just I want to see if I
still have it I mean I do makeup a lot
but yeah yeah nah I don't think I'm
gonna use a primer because I I always
use primers and I kinda wanna see what
it's like without a primer and I'm also
going to read right after this so I am
gonna use my Mac prep and prime oh yeah
mmm there's just something about when
they sting something on your face that
just feels really nice I have my
eyebrows done it just because they were
from a while ago so they probably look
rough but I'm gonna do foundation
because why not I don't love foundation
but we go and do it but feel like a full
face of makeup looks better with
foundation so this is the a cosmetics CC
+ cream I use this all the time I've
been using this oh god I thought that
was a bug I'm gonna go in with medium
because I did a self tanner today I
always always put way too much by
accident so I think this is too pale for
me but we'll bronze me up
I really don't
I've done in the point where you're so
tired don't feel normal
this setup makes me look like I'm just
in a black nothingness but it's late and
it's dark
maybe primer does make a difference like
right away their pinkies I just realized
my feet was on I just turned it off if
it's making a noise and if it's been
making a noise in the background I'm so
sorry
someone needs to just blend with me and
keep me saying I'm gonna go in with my
it cosmetics weightless smoothing
complete coverage concealer oh my
godness Oh bye-bye under-eye they
freaked out I wanted to try this brush
by in cosmetics but I forgot but I'm
gonna use it now for the concealer I
think if it's a concealer brush okay
what was this second sale or Nova I'm
using the media we're gonna put that I
look really scary right now but I'm
gonna do eyes life can't be lived
without mouth spilling something
make sure the concealer is set on
eyelids I'm gonna be interesting and try
it oh girl I'm gonna try out this Sigma
palette let's take a moment like that is
pretty I'm gonna start with toasty and
I'm just gonna put this in my crease oh
oh oh I'm quite a fan of this palette so
far I mean I've only use one color so
it's blendable is available it's noise
actually I almost feel more focused that
too I am doing my makeup I'm not going
with green I want to do a green or red
okay
so these colors are just like really
pretty and I can either go in with these
greens reds baby Browns and cold no
Browns and gold's
is basic I'm gonna do green because I'm
living life too
I'm gonna take after hours which is like
literally an army green color we're
gonna put that kind of brown this is not
very green but I'm doing it anyways the
focus is on the outer beach I make like
a wing type of thing I don't see this is
just not right brush oh god I made a
word that does not look like green I'm
just gonna say freaking for the one time
it looks it's just so bad right now but
let's see if we can revive it
so I wet the brush and I'm gonna take
Fool's Gold which is a very sparkly
green what hold up oh just kidding oh my
god this is okay yeah she green green
they say cut whoa I need an experiment
would make it more often do we got it it
really makes my eye light super green
this is kind of intense
what if I put okay wait idea I'm gonna
put someone beaming which is like a
champagne color on the top to see if it
sparkles more Oh nailed it
look here her I'm gonna go back in with
the army green color I'm gonna put that
in the crease because it didn't look
good
the other kind listen I I finished this
the high and I tried to make it the same
as the other eye but I don't I don't
know at this point I'm gonna go in with
the same concealer I used on the eyelids
and under the eyes I'm gonna try to make
a wing shape intense man I'm not eating
this right now but I look really greasy
so we gonna fix that my powder is like
pretty much
oh my god it's pretty much it's out to
Marissa alright I just powdered my whole
face new bronzer I'm gonna take this
lorac Pro contoured
my favorite contouring valid I use
medium contour that one and I'm just
gonna put that on my cheekbones I like
to do this when I do it you gotta do the
jawline oh I'm gonna be lazy and just go
like this with nose contour because nose
contour takes me forever and I'm just
not in the mood whenever I put makeup on
my nose it gets so itchy does anyone
really probably just me but oh my god
it's a struggle after contour I'm like
stuck I keep looking at myself in this
viewfinder and I'm like I like it when I
look at it and I'm probably gonna edit
it and be like my home what were you
doing if you know me if you know me you
know that the voluminous lash paradise
by L'Oreal is like my favorite mascara
and it still is it's still super good
but I'm running out of it buckstone send
me this mascara it's the big tease
mascara and I've been loving it dead-ass
dude oh it has B I put this first and
then I layer other mascaras because I
like the full effect with my eyelashes
so I'm just gonna put one coat oh my it
looks good but it's a little clunky
right now so I'm gonna go in with the
voluminous mascara I've noticed this
really helps give volume to your lashes
and then finally last mascara I put it
on the tops just because my eyelashes
with blonde so this keeps them really
black because sometimes they still look
blonde I usually put a lot of time into
my lashes that's good then I'm just
gonna go back in with the green color
because you know we did a green look to
do and I'm gonna put it under my lower
lash line under my lower lashes my lower
lash line
I don't okay it's the same thing I think
that was a lot I don't know if Thomas
too much
definitely much less alien blood so I
just put a little bit of the club
pressure from covergirl on my bottom
lashes I'm gonna concert my eyebrows and
just kind of keep them now they were a
little bit of highlighter on my nose and
for fun because so what this is all
about put a little bit up here I'm gonna
take my Mac why am i setting my face I
don't know but I'm going to so the
makeup can last the whole 10 minutes I'm
gonna be wearing it maybe I'll film
another video after this but that might
fall asleep I'm pretty sure that's it to
this video yeah I forgot trap stick I
