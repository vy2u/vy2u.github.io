hello my beautiful best friend as you
can tell I am in the car sliding is and
if setup is in I tried so many different
tripods for my camera and none of them
work really brave what sick well the
moral of the story is I tried a lot of
different tripods for my camera and none
of them work so we're stuck with my
iPhone please take them or some of my
iPhone and place the apples like and
also do it so today is going to be a
driving with Mal as you can tell because
I'm driving I really really just wanted
to talk about why I haven't posted or
been posting like regularly like I
always do I'm kind of like a weird
mindset recently or like really really
really good at stressing myself out and
like creating problems for myself that
don't even like exist and I don't need a
dress about but I do stress about this
I've just been in like a really weird
mindset a very unmotivated mindset where
like I don't want to do anything I don't
feel very confident I just want to lay
in bed it's like I don't know everything
like that so I've been in that mindset
recently which is so freaking hard to
film when you're like that because I
just didn't feel like myself on camera I
tried filming multiple times I would
take my face I just I would sit down in
a big I can't get it
I don't know I thought that maybe this
video would be better because I feel
like not all the pressures in front of
the studio lights or whatever and I love
love love driving this is something that
like whenever I'm in a bad mood why is
there always traffic we should never be
traffic where I live and now whatever I
go on the road I am stressing it's
because tonight people are making too
many babies too many people in pictures
I thought this video would be better
because I love driving I love it
whenever I'm stressed out or whatever
like if I go on a drive to this blast
music like I'll being such a better food
on my way lets roast restore because
we're out of like every food item I eat
on the regular so fluffy what I also
don't have them crooked I think I am I'm
going to go alright this is something to
talk more in a different video just
about like my own diet e-patient stuff
if you guys like to do that I'm really
good at like not talking about my
problems and whatever because I don't
want to burden people with my problems
because I know everybody else is going
through their own problems even on so
someone who loves to listen to people's
problems and try to help but I feel like
I don't want a burden that was my
problem like that's always been an issue
of mine it's so crowded it's so crowded
yet I am vlogging what's up what this is
fall right here but a big so ok do
please on anything
oh oh I'm gonna go get my grocery and
they will probably go in a little Drive
because I got like no footage there I am
back the grocery store
what's gone going a little drive type
job you know I'm going to take you on a
really pretty drive I don't even know if
you'll be able to see it but like this
is all my favorite drive in my area well
I also realized I can't play music
because I'm recording and I'm so pissed
because I was going to like get out
whatever so I guess I'll do a different
video on carpool karaoke maybe with some
friends or something and it's shaking
bro why are you shaking videos really
all over the place but I just wanted to
have something on so you guys just
because like I'm in this mindset I don't
know I always wanted to give you guys a
video this week even though if it's just
me being all over the place in the car
what it is if you see a famous drive is
like I hope you pan like it's so nice
bro I can say which way I want to go I
shouldn't have gone this way because God
uses in a high part I thought this is
what I went to my old middle school
throw babba if you know me in person you
know I literally the words with
direction like I've been living in this
area of my entire life 17 years almost
18 I still don't know how to get around
like I do in some cases Holden aye sir
um the place is under like ten minutes
away from mine like now like good luck
to me not happening also I had a thought
I was living if anyone knew issues going
to sound so weird how to stop yourself
from having dreams because I've been
having really really bad dreams like in
the past couple of nights and then I
wake up in a terrible mood and I like
can't fix it for the rest of the day so
if any of you guys know how to like just
turn off your dreams if that's a thing
let your girl know in the comments down
below I feel like that would help my
musical
because my dreams is really piss me off
I don't know why okay I'm going to take
the freeway home a lot of people hate
driving on the freeway but I love it
actually my favorite road to drive on
probably if you ask why I can't answer
that because I have no but I really
enjoy it
maybe because I like goes fast I'm
looking probably good I feel like this
isn't even like main Channel video
quality but like I shouldn't stress
about my youtube it's what I love do Oh
which ways I want to go ah we're not
gonna tell I'm gonna let you go you go
share you do you well as I say what I
really just want to start doing with my
youtube channel is really just posting
like what I love and everything and like
not worry it it's like not professional
huh or whatever I don't know I figure
you tube is a way for you guys to see my
life and like what it's really like and
that's how I'm going to keep it you fail
when this drive is so pretty I should
really do this more often when I'm in a
club just go out and dry
freaking gorgeous Oh all right we get it
you drive sighs always wanted to be a
drag racer I've got so pretty well below
that so much for you when you're not in
a drought
you shaky-shaky things like that I think
when two emerges laying together I mean
when two lanes merge together yeah there
we go one and you're like right next to
someone and you're about to be in the
same Lane I get so stressed out and
either like gas it or like step on the
procedures of stress will you feel I'm
here getting a lot lighter didn't know I
died a brown a while ago and I really
missed out dark it was we're going to
keep going I have so much I was going to
say in this video extra skin at all I'm
really angry ah
playing classical misread the situation
wait though
boom when I try to be nice of it we had
success when I try to be nice to drivers
and let them in but they like stop in
front of me like dude I'm letting you in
please just like maybe press that gas
pedal dad kind of accelerate the
whittling I really wish I could listen
to my own music random oh I guess a good
song

loser alright now I'm on a bra wait my
friends I can't I can't respond don't I
feel driving I wasn't ready wait so many
people are texting me I usually never

go can I go I'm going to go alright cool
I always like a style I can I go can I
know if is even what wasn't with friends
