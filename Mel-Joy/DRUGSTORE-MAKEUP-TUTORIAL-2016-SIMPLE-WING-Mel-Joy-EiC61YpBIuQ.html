video is going to be a look on this
makeup look that I was wearing in some
Instagram photos and Twitter photos you
don't say and a lot of you guys are like
you know you should your tutorial I did
a tutorial it's pretty similar but the
thing that is different about this video
is that everything is a drugstore
products because makeup is expensive and
I wanted to create a look that was
affordable for you guys because there's
oh what is that there's so many products
in the drugstore that are just as good
as the high-end products and all that
stuff I was like you know what I'm gonna
do that I'm and also just to bring this
up I know I even shouldn't but just
being me I I need closure on it in my
how I did my makeup in middle school
video I got some comments saying that I
was making fun of people who couldn't
afford expensive makeup because I was
talking about how cheap I was in middle
school because I was very very cheap I
just did not want to spend money on
anything like I just refused to and
that's some bad thing like at all I just
want to clear things up and make sure
you guys know that I would never ever
ever ever mean to offend you guys or
make fun of you guys purposely like oh
my god no I use drugstore products every
day
I love jugstore products like you can't
beat the drugstore products I just I
don't know I wanted to clear that up and
thought this would be the perfect video
to clear that up in because it's a
drugstore makeup look so yeah I hope you
guys enjoy this video and if you're new
to my channel hello my name is mal it is
great to meet you thank you so much for
watching I would really appreciate it if
you would subscribe it would make my
heart very happy I have faith you know
where the button is if you want to see
how to get this look then stay tuned and
keep watching so the first thing I'm
doing is putting up my hair with a
headband yeah that's what it's called
and then taking my baby skin primer from
Maybelline and just putting that in my
places where I have the like most pores
I guess and then I'm taking my fit me
like matte foundation I think it's kind
of new I could be totally wrong but I
really like this stuff like a lot and
then I'm taking my Maybelline age rewind
concealer it's favorite favorite
drugstore concealers oh my goodness I'm
up
and I'm putting that in triangles under
my eyes and then on my forehead and
everything where I usually put it and I
have two different shades in this one is
light and one is fair just for like
highlighting and covering purposes you
know what I'm saying and then I'm
blending that out with my Beauty Blender
I know it's not a drugstore but like I
really just don't know what else you use
like I would be lost without my Beauty
Blender so I had to I'm sorry I'm sorry
there's definitely dupes I know that
then I'm taking my Milani just
translucent powder this is like
replacing my setting powder you know
friend of my eyes and stuff but I'm just
putting that like all over my face and
mostly where I put the concealer because
the foundation is matte so then I'm
taking my ELF lip exfoliator I love this
stuff oh my goodness and then I'm taking
the blushed nudes palette with my
Ecotools eyeshadow brush and I'm taking
just the white color to like put that
all over my lid to like get rid of any
veins or anything you know what I'm
saying and then I'm taking this kind of
like darker nude like light brown pretty
much and I'm just blending that into my
crease for some definition you don't
need to do this but I just like having a
little bit of definition you know what
I'm saying so yeah and then I'm taking
my ecotools blending brush and just
blending that all out then I'm taking
the same color with the eye shadow brush
and I'm putting that on my lower lash
line for more definition as well just to
kind of smoke the look up a little bit
and then I'm taking my Maybelline master
precise eyeliner this is my all-time
favorite eyeliner like liquid eyeliner
and I'm doing a wing this wasn't like my
best wing ever definitely not but like
you know we have our bad wing days um
but I'm pretty much just like extending
that out from the bottom of my I really
don't know how to explain and you can
like watch you can see how frustrated I
am I tried to make him even you know we
tried and then I'm curling my lashes
with my Sally Hansen eyelash curler love
this thing then I'm going in with the
first mascara this is a telescopic
mascara by L'Oreal I believe this is
good for like lengthening then I'm
taking my extreme volume from essence
which is good for volume and that's like
two dollars it's amazing and then I'm
taking my covergirl clump crusher just
to clump
nope just to crush those clumps there we
go and that's from a covergirl
I think I said that and then I'm just
taking the spoolie and like cleaning it
up if
got any little mascara thingies on me
and then I'm also just brushing my brows
that is my brow routine I literally just
brush them out and then taking my
trublend covergirl bronzer I love this
bronzer I've been using this a lot
lately and I'm swirling that onto my
cheekbones with my mini stippling brush
from ELF and like on my jaw line and a
little bit on my nose on my temple
forehead you got me and then I'm just
blending it out with a Ecotools like big
fluffy brush and I'm taking one of my
favorite all-time blushes this is from
ELF and candid coral I barely wear blush
but when I do I like to wear kind of
like a peachy color like this so I just
put a little bit of that on my
cheekbones then I'm going in with this
pop highlighter palette and this is
actually really good so if you're
looking for a highlighter palette that's
affordable uh yeah and I'm just putting
out on my cheekbones my nose everywhere
I want to highlight under my brow bone
a little bit like on my forehead not for
it you'll see right there yeah like I'm
blending it up um and then I'm just
blending it out again I also put some on
my kiba's felt and then for lips I'm
going in with my grapefruit lip balm you
know I tried to round my lip palette
grab the eyeshadow but I'm taking this
L'Oreal lip palette I love this so much
and I'm just taking this light pink
color just for a little natural gloss
you feel me
and then also I took this little morphe
brush just because this is completely
optional but I just put little freckles
on my face if you want a tutorial for
this let me know I literally did like
really natural ones but yeah I did that
