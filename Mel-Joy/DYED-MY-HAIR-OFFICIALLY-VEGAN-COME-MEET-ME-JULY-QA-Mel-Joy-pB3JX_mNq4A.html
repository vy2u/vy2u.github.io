Mel and today's video is going to be a
Q&amp;amp;A also if you're not already
subscribed I would love it if you would
do so it would make my heart really
happy we're almost at 500,000 and you
guys are amazing as a whole different
video but thank you and I can't look at
myself the same way in this viewfinder
because I have purple hair so I'm just
gonna address this fact because they're
talking to me a lot of questions in the
Q&amp;amp;A about this but so I dyed my hair
purple yeah if you saw my tweet I said
that I make really impulsive decisions
this was definitely one of them so yeah
that's this is where right now it only
lasts 5 to 10 washes so it'll be out
within a couple weeks if you hate it
don't worry if you love it let me know
cuz maybe I'll do something like this
again so I found out really quickly a
dress that this yeah let me know if you
like it it's honestly just like purple
kind of like more on the front because I
blocked her hair's there and I'm still
not used to it but it's you know why not
it's summer and it'll be out soon I
don't even know if there'll be many
videos with my purple hair anyway
because I have like pre filled videos
really filming before I get into this
video I really wanted to let you guys
know that I want to know where you guys
live and that sounds really creepy but
it's because there might be an
opportunity where you guys can meet me
so please click the link down below or
click right here put in where you live
and if you'd be down to come hang out
with me it's not finalized anything yet
and I'm really excited about it I want
to be able to meet all your beautiful
faces
so please click that link down below and
say where you live because I want to
meet you do that stop right out and do
it today I'm doing a Q&amp;amp;A on my Twitter I
love Twitter Twitter is the homie I
asked you guys to ask me questions on my
Twitter with the hashtag killjoy because
that's my name if you don't follow me on
my Twitter it's Mel joy because I got
that handle yes because if you didn't
know it used to be Mel to screwed over
three wise but that we've moved on and
why I'm doing a Q&amp;amp;A is because a lot of
big
as you can tell in my life that I feel
like I need to update you guys on ya
know and cuz I love CUNY's cuz I get to
talk to you guys I feel like it were a
hoodie and every single in my CUNY's
should we make it a thing comment down
below if we should make it a thing I try
to like switch off social medias for
kione's if you want to take part in
these few days you should follow me on
my social media because Twitter won't be
the next one I differ one will be next
one so yeah let's get serious
would you rather grow up in the 60s 70s
80s or 90s and ooh this is a really good
question honestly think 70s because I
love that 70 show and just living in
that time just looks like so much fun or
90s just I feel like the fashion to is
just so fun and I don't know honestly
any of them are going to make another
video with Jackson or your other guy
friends PS I love more than life please
follow me well I love you more and yes I
got you girl on the follow
and I don't know do you guys want to see
videos with my guy friends because you
guys seem to love them and they love
being in them so comment down below
we're like this video if you want me to
because I have other guy friends I could
you know put in my videos I probably
will though because I love my guy
friends
so someone asks what's the hardest thing
about being a youtuber and this is a
really good question um I think for me
personally it's feeling like I don't
want to let you guys down there's so
many good things that like this doesn't
even like like this doesn't even matter
compared to all the good things like the
ratio is so off between good and bad
things I don't know kind of a
perfectionist I've talked about this in
some my videos before and I just feel
like if I'm not producing the best
quality I can be producing like I I take
it personally and I like get frustrated
at myself because I feel you guys
deserve better than that because you
guys are honestly the best subscribers
out there on I'm just like guys it's
honestly true yeah honestly that's
probably no that's sending the worst
thing but it's like probably one of the
hardest things so someone asks why did
you dye your hair purple is so pretty
and by the way I love you so much
I love you so much - and thank you for
saying it's pretty why because I make
really impulsive decisions oh it's bad
literally ten at ten o'clock at night I
was like you know what tomorrow I'm
gonna dye my hair purple I don't know
why but it happened I think also because
when I was at beautycon I got given like
a free hair dye and it was like purple
colorizer thingy and I was like you know
what I'm just gonna try it out use it
see if I like it and we were left with
this about honestly just like I like
changes you know sometimes I just feel
like I need a change like I'm craving
change and this is a change that you
know is it permanent and it's fun so
someone asks how is beautycon and beauty
college was balm i met so many of you
guys and that's like the best thing i
met a lot of creators i met a lot of
supporters i had a mean grave with some
really awesome girls it was just it was
it was a good time you know
let's get I was happy when my friend
Brandon just asked can I battle you in
Pokemon go look so this is such a big
thing now and I don't know what happened
or when this started I just got the app
like couple days ago because my friend
Alex told me about it like what is this
like I don't know I honestly feel like I
might get into it so if I start getting
into it you heard it first and yes of
course Brandon you can someone asked me
why did you take off your eyelash
extensions I love you Mel I love you too
and why I took off my Alec if you didn't
know I took off my eyelash extensions I
feel like one I actually missed putting
on mascara like what I wanted the option
to be able to look like I'm not wearing
makeup and also I feel like it wasn't
doing my eyelashes that good just
because I had them on for so long I had
them on for probably five months and I
think that they were actually getting to
the point where they might have been
damaging my eyelashes I don't know if
you guys want to see a whole different
Q&amp;amp;A about this I will definitely do it
cuz I have a lot to say about it
honestly feel like my eyelashes aren't
the same is when I got them put on um
but I could be wrong I'm gonna look at
the before and after photos it also
might have been cuz when I would put on
like
mascara get on the top which I feel like
messed with it but I don't know a lot of
different things contributed to me
getting them off and I also miss like
applying false eyelashes and if like
tutorials would be better now and I
don't know it's also really expensive to
uphold as well and I also took off my
eyelash extensions by myself which is
probably not smart that's another
impulsive decision then I did so that
also might have contributed to the fact
that I didn't just pull them off don't
worry like I looked it up online I like
steamed my face and then olive oil and
I'm for like two hours over yeah that
frozen um I guess idea just another
impulsive decision because you know me
so someone asked what I ever come to
Ireland yes I'm like super Irish like
most of my nationality is Irish so I
would be so down it oh it's actually
going to go this summer but I end up
going but maybe soon and if I do end up
going I'll tweet you okay so someone
asked tips for getting over breakup for
girls and guys realize that you will be
okay and that everything happens for a
reason if this did not work out it's not
the end of the world you have so much
going for you you don't need that other
one person in your life to complete you
you don't if you're having trouble
getting through it tweet me I would love
to help you through it it's gonna be all
good and if they broke up with you
they're stupid and your treasure you're
a dime you're a dad so this is a really
interesting question someone asked what
qualities do you look for in a
significant other and in a girl best
friend I already answered the
significant other in like one of my
other Q&amp;amp;A so I'm just going to talk
about the girl best friend one because
you guys really don't know this but I
don't have that many girlfriends I have
a couple girlfriends and like I'm I'm
like friends with a lot of them but I'm
not like super close with a lot of them
if that makes sense but I'm really close
with like a lot of my guy friends I
don't know my high school I just ended
up being more with guys there's a lot of
like self-consciousness going on so now
hangout thrills oh just be them
complaining about how they looked or how
how happy they were things like that and
I was like not into that because I want
people to feel confident in themselves
and I would try to help them through
that some of them just wouldn't like
take my help with guys it's just less of
that and I love having
it's obviously like having like a ton of
brothers it's just great what qualities
I look for in a girl best friend no
drama
they don't spend however long
complaining about how they look or
something like that yeah I know how I
feel about turning 17 soon love you I
love you too and I'm pumped I'm honestly
very excited my birthday's August 2nd if
you didn't know and I'm just excited to
be a year older 16 was a good year I'm
excited to see what 17 brings ya know so
someone asks what's your favorite thing
about meeting subscribers everything
about it I don't even know where to
begin on that just everything just
getting to meet you guys is like the
best feeling it just makes me so happy
it honestly does like I could be having
a terrible day and then one of you guys
will come up to me and say like hey Mel
about your videos and my day instantly
will like be good because it's just a
number on a screen honestly for me and
then when you meet people you're like
it's not a number like it's real people
and you guys are all so sweet and so
nice I love hugging you guys and Tommy
if you guys are taking cute photos and
it's just it's a great time so Sam says
tell something in Spanish I took Spanish
for three years I don't anymore but
let's see Romeo melodia me family total
port a is basket foam yeah we're gonna
we're gonna okay and also another thing
that I wanted to address just because a
lot of you guys have been asking me
there's been so many questions because
I've been posting what I eat on snapchat
and things like that and I posted it on
a comment on my video but yes I am vegan
I am officially a vegan 100% vegan food
I'm transferring in with the like
clothes and the makeup and everything
I'm gonna begin by the time you see this
video it'll probably be here for around
a month and the reason I became vegan
was okay a lot of reasons I can do a
whole different video on this if you
guys want that comment down below and
like this video if you do I was driving
home from LA one time and I drove past a
cow farm actually this is right after
VidCon and I saw how many cows were
there I felt this really weird feeling
and I just felt so sick I felt like it
honestly put me in a bad mood and then
when I started looking videos up vegan
videos watching more getting more
educated about it I was like I can't eat
meat anymore or like dairy products or
anything like
I don't know I couldn't it was just some
weird feeling I had so that's where I'm
at right now but I wanted to let you
guys know that I'm officially vegan you
want any like vegan recipes or why I
became vegan or anything just let me
know and I will do it for you so yeah I
think that's all the questions that I'm
going to be answering in this Q&amp;amp;A cuz
already have like 20 to 23 minutes of
footage but I love you guys to infinity
and beyond I mean it when I say it and I
hope you're having a marvelous morning
afternoon or night and sorry if I was
