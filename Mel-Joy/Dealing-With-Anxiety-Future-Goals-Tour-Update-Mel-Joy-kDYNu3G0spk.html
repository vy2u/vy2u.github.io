posture oh I almost broke my back today
guys good - hello hello hello hello
hello
I can't hello my beautiful best friend
so today's video is going to be a Q&amp;amp;A as
you can tell I'm in a city so you know
that's the time it is if you didn't know
I wear the D and every single in my Q
days I don't know why I feel the need to
like share that so some of you guys
might be getting sick with my Q news
just because I do them once a month and
it's been a month since I've done my
last one so it's like you know what why
not do another one I know it's summer
you guys like we're all the fun summer
videos at and I promise I promise
they'll be coming soon I'm still in
school literally like in finals week and
I filmed the video yesterday I didn't
like it so now we're back here just
doing a simple Q&amp;amp;A to get something up
for you guys because I am in silence
week and it sucks
so pretty much today's video is just
going to be me answering your guys's
questions from Twitter since one of my
favorite videos to film because I feel
like I'm literally just like having
combos with you guys and it's my
favorite thing also if you couldn't tell
I'm reppin my own merch today you know
you got to get that shameless self
problem I was also running out of
hoodies that I haven't worn in other
videos so but if you do want to check
out my marriage it's a bit dot ly /
capital M so mal - capital j joy you
feel neat I feel like I'm like really
short got posture defenses so I asked
you guys on Twitter to choose the
hashtag ask Mel joy
I took some screenshots of my favorite
ones you'll know and if you don't follow
my Twitter and you want to it's just at
Mel joy that's the simple username I
have like the only one what's the best
advice someone has given you okay
definitely my dad because my dad is like
the best giver of advice ever
I should literally start an advice
column with him because whenever I need
advice I just run downstairs vent rant
whatever and always gives me the advice
I need and it's so sick and I just so
that's the best piece of advice he's
probably given me is to let your love
light shine he groomed me up saying that
and I want to touch you about it that's
just like how much it means to me
because it grew me up like since I was a
little kid a little kid saying like Mel
let your love light shine and I
just value that a lot it's pretty much a
love lines like how much love you emit
into the world so always just admit as
much love as you can I hope Amit works
in this woods but pretty much you just
give everyone as much love to them as
you can and you just be your best self
to everyone I just I don't know as I
grew up like my number one thing was
like love everyone loved everything be
nice to everyone you know what I mean in
the end I was like a really good piece
of advice my dad gave me and he also
says this to shell test whenever I come
downstairs sad or mad you know mrs. Mel
this too shall pass and I'm like you
write like your sadness doesn't last
forever whatever and he's just really
taught me that and I love it I love him
so thank you Dad you do this I'm a shout
out my homegirl I love you she says
numers coming soon and yes I'm working
on new merch like clothing merch for the
summer because I want to have more like
summer clothing but also I'm coming out
with a new necklace I'm not completely
done with all the finishing touches yet
I'm working on it right now but it
should be probably in a couple weeks
maybe I'm hoping maybe even sooner so
stay tuned for that I'm obsessed with it
I love it I don't know it's just
something that's like really my style so
I'm like really happy about it do you
have any tips for dealing with anxiety
PS love you so much I love you more
you're so sweet so if you guys haven't
seen my like last amount of videos where
I talk about anxiety and whatever yes I
struggle with anxiety and yes it's
sourcing to exist ever but my piece of
advice when you're experiencing anxiety
shut yourself down and just like lay in
bed or go to sleep because when I have
anxiety sometimes I try to do things
like to strike myself and yes in a way
that helps like going out friends or
whatever but also every little thing
that you're doing when you have that
anxiety it's just like it makes it worse
is that make sense I don't know how to
explain it annoy likes just so hard to
swing by but my piece of advice if
you're the type of person that needs to
go out and like distract yourself and do
that but for me my way is just kind of
like taking baths or just laying in bed
watching Netflix or just spending some
time to me honestly and just blasting
music and just trying to get myself out
of it and whatever also just to vent
like if I really got anxiety and I just
need a vent and rant or whatever go to
someone you love and trust and just vent
to them that's like my favorite thing it
just takes so much stress and so much
relief out of you and it's just amazing
so that would be my advice
someone asks what's your life goal and I
think that's very interesting because a
life span is a pretty long time I'm 17
right now about a beauty
ha so probably my life goal is to just
be happy just be happy because I have
really figured out a lot throughout my
life I know some super deep and
achieving stupid but honestly I don't
even know how to explain this but I feel
like I'm a lot older than I am I know
that sounds stupid that's why I'm just
so excited to be 18 and like start doing
these old things and whatever it sure
like I grew up really fast and it's not
like a bad thing
it's also not like oh my god so she just
thinks we're growing up and like
experiencing having a job and doing
things and whatever I don't know it's
hard to explain but it made me realize
that I just want to be so happy my whole
life like I know a lot of people want
like 10 Lambos and like that'd be sick I
love that but that's like not the number
one thing me it's just like my happiness
and making other people around me happy
and that would be my ultimate goal just
to be completely genuinely happy wake up
everyone with a smile on my face and
just be so happy to go about my day you
know what I mean
and I'm not saying I'm like not like
that right now but I just want that to
be my constant mood and I know that's
really a library but that's my goal what
would you say is our fandom name that's
a really good question because I don't
think we have one I think we had like a
Twitter pull once but like it wasn't a
super final thing so comment down below
what you guys are on our fandom aim to
be let's just decide well in the
comments maybe whatever name gets the
most likes or like the name people like
the most I don't know do that down below
because I want our family to have a name
sometimes where you miss the most about
basketball and that's actually a really
good question
because I play basketball for six eight
years I was not the best but I loved it
just because I got exercise as I was
playing something that I loved doing you
know I miss it
since I'm in high school I can't really
play and I don't want to do club because
that takes a lot of times I've also
completely lost all my skills by not
probably to any of the skills that were
there but I do miss having like a team
that you just hang out with and bond
with getting exercise but not kind of
realize
you're getting exercise because you love
doing it so much do you know what I mean
like I just missed that like now it's
like go to a gym and workout but I used
to just do something I love and get a
good ass where I got out of it oh so
some hats if you didn't do YouTube what
would your dream job be it's actually a
really good question I would probably
say honestly designing clothes and like
having a clothing line or a makeup line
I don't know I just really like creating
something and like having a message from
something so someone asked updates on
tour I love you I love you too probably
like half the questions you guys asked
as QA was about my tour as of now
there's not a set date of me going on
tour there's just a lot going on right
now I'm about to be routine I want to
like things out I want to whatever I was
just on the phone with someone about it
or but it's just not all like fitting
together right now just not right we're
here right now so maybe in the future I
would absolutely kill to do that because
I want to meet you guys and I feel like
it would be so fun
and it'd just be like a whole family
hanging out I'm even though so I'm
asking my favorite flower and honestly
you have them too right there I think I
like roses and some flowers the best I
think that's my favorite flower right
now it's basic but I like it
this is someone asks what are your
Netflix or music recommendations I love
you so much I love you too and for
Netflix I'm going to say just
Riverdale's
because actually like almost everything
on that click okay that's false but I
watched Riverdale with my friend
literally like in two days and it was so
good like I want a second season at all
so close brows is looking like a snack
throughout that that whole food that's
my Netflix recommendations and then
music oh I don't think I've talked about
this my videos called horses by Kota
flag a movie with a hoodie
PNB Rock whatever a lot of people and
it's really good
on the nail XS and fears of them and
then block in my bed this song is kind
of like not rude but when I play with my
friends like okay thanks Mel and like
this is AHA by smoke purp this is how it
goes I'm going to do all that for music
if you guys want to see a whole video on
music let me know maybe I come to my
function with something but I could talk
about music forever so let me know and I
will definitely do that so someone asks
what are your favorite clothing stores
to shop it at and PS I'll be so much and
are you going to VidCon I love you too
and yes I'm going to VidCon also my
favorite stores we only talk about that
real quick probably your mouth udders I
could spend all my money at Urban
Outfitters or like little online shops
and for VidCon yes mean Olivia are
actually going together Olivia I'm
Olivia and I are actually going together
I'm so excited I'm flying out to LA at
the end of June like before VidCon and
they would love it for a little bit and
then we road tripping down to VidCon
we're staying there together we're going
to be there I think all three days is it
three name something food so literally
if you see me there come say hi because
I would love love love to meet you you
have no idea so yeah I will be there be
there be square so I think that's all
the questions I'm going to answer for
today but if you want me to do more cute
eggs and whatever or like you raised
about certain subjects I feel like I
should change out my queue A's to make
them more interesting because I feel
like they're really repetitive so let me
know down below if you have any ideas
for that I'll probably start doing like
topics like advice videos okay so stay
tuned for those hopefully those will be
coming out soon I love you guys to
infinity and beyond
I mean it when I say it and I hope you
know that and I hope that you're having
a marvelous morning afternoon or night
now hopefully see you in my next video
this is oh wait wait wait wait this is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
