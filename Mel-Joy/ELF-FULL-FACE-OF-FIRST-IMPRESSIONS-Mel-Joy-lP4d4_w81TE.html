you can tell I woke up like this
today's video is going to be a first
impression on the brand elf I go way
back without like in middle school and
all that stuff elf was all I used it was
my lifeline like for makeup when I was
younger literally so I'm back here and I
just went to Target and I picked up a
lot of makeup I bought like 20 products
I feel like like a lot of products but I
only spent as much as you would spend on
like three products at a high-end makeup
place I got mostly new products that I
haven't used because I've used so many
of elfs products like in the past and I
wanted to like see if I like the new
products as much as I like the old
products so yeah before we get started
into this video I just wanted to say
hello
my name is Mel if you have not seen my
face before what is up I hope you're
doing awesome you already know I would
appreciate it if you hit that subscribe
button I probably did the wrong way I
still don't know and I'm good on YouTube
for three years who am i and if you want
to be notified for every time I post a
video and then make sure to click the
little notification bell I faith you
know where the button and the Bell is
both without further ado let's just get
started on to the makeup the first
impressions I'm really excited let's do
it we are close-up on my face now what's
up what I usually do is start with a
primer and then go to a setting spray to
like lock in the primer I also don't
have a mirror so this is gonna be super
fun do I try to find a man I decided to
choose the green primer this is the part
of my nose I haven't gotten them done in
a minute this is the what is this this
is the elf tone adjusting face primer
and it is in neutralizing green I have a
really bad redness like I get red zero
to 100 real quick my face is just very
expressive of how its feeling and
temperature-wise and I don't know so
we're just gonna try this out maybe
it'll help cancel out my redness bad
beat doe it just comes with a little
pump the pump and a pump it on oh look
at that really green like I feel like I
just put Shrek's DNA okay let's check
this out this is what looks like a
little green glob oh my god this feels
heavenly almost get like this primer is
just so smooth I just want to apply this
on my face all day pretty much blending
this everywhere let's see so as you
could tell I thought it was like super
smooth it just
feels so nice on the skin my face just
feel like silk right now that's the only
way I can describe it now my hands feel
all silky - now we're gonna go in with
this aqua beauty primer mist oh this is
like their aqua line they have like a
whole line I could do a skincare first
review on elf if you guys want me to but
I just thought I would keep it for
makeup on this video in this video are
their directions like I don't want to
mess this up oh I was not expecting that
it comes up super strong so first
opinions on the mess when I tap it down
it's not like super sticky actually it's
getting stickier but like usually after
I put like a setting spray on my face is
sticky I think this would be really good
life throughout the day too because it
is just like aqua primer me so I don't
know what's been here but I'm guessing
water is the leading ingredient yep it
is Sofer foundation I decided to try out
the foundation serum with a goji berry
25 SPF I love SPF protects your face
I've tried some of their other
foundations so I wanted to try this one
I've tried their BB cream that's all I
used to use in middle school oh my
goodness I also don't know if this is my
shade this could be way darker way
lighter I have no idea but it's in the
light/medium I was gonna buy a
foundation brush but then I thought I
would use a damp Beauty Blender because
this is what I use like for all of my
foundations most of the time I just
wanted to see if the foundation would
deliver well used with a Beauty Blender
I'm gonna pump some on the skin oh
pretty liquidly
it's pretty liquidly I can't see pretty
liquidy as I put it on so liquid
foundation yes it is
color wise so you can see I'm putting it
on half of my face right now and you can
kind of compare the two okay so this is
the side I applied it on I'm actually
pretty pleased with this so far I only
put on one layer and this is what what
it's looking like it's like not
completely covering my acne scarring but
a lot of foundations don't do that I
have dated it so far let's okay let's
put the rest on elf
so this is one layer of the foundation
I'm like pretty pleased with this like
in person okay I want to see if this
layers well so I'm gonna put a little on
my blemishes and acne scarring and see
if another coat will help get rid of it
I don't know I tried to do another layer
after I did it the first one like I like
one layer I think we're just gonna go
with one layer usually I like to do my
brows before I put on
and all that good stuff but I forgot so
I'm just gonna go in with the brow
pencil in taupe it just looks like this
I can't move any closer so I hope you
can see my brows so first thoughts the
brow pencil is a lot bigger than what I
usually use but it kind of like own
territory fast like it got in there and
it's claiming its land I think the color
match is good I'm like what else Brooke
I kind of like how big it is cuz it like
gets stuff done faster but for like
preciseness I don't think this would be
your pencil because it's just so thick a
little thick bro well scoop scoop I just
don't know I don't know when to stop I
feel like that just did so much so fast
okay yeah preciseness not the best in
like my small areas that I want to fill
in it'll just kind of go in there with a
lot more product than I wanted other
than not I really like it I like the
formula I like the color
new I would say this is perfect for like
an easy quick brow because that took me
like two seconds um I usually just go
into eyeshadow and then I do concealer
after so I can like clean those edges
you feel me the eyeshadow I got is the
mad for matte eyeshadow palette and when
I saw this I was so excited because I
don't own like any matte palettes
I just love matte eyeshadow I don't know
what it is it just looks like this these
are the colors I love them okay I'm
excited
hold the Frick okay I don't know what I
want to do now this is bad I wanted to
do a matte eye but then I saw this and I
got this molten liquid eyeshadow in a
rose gold I wanted to try this out so
bad because photos I see on tumblr all
the time just like an eye and it has
like the perfect rose gold color shadow
all over the eye and it just looks so
pretty I just feel like rose gold eye
shadow has been in for so long and I've
just never found the right color for me
and I don't know how I want to let go
about this I don't know if I'm supposed
to have a powder over this I don't know
I think I'm just gonna do nothing on the
lids okay we're just gonna go in first
impressions it's super easy to blend
like super easy to blend it seems to be
pretty buildable to like as I put more
on it's not like creasing or clumping up
or anything
I'm really hoping you can see it on
camera this is gorgeous I picked up some
brushes from ELF because that's like all
I want to use for this look are you
feeling three eyeshadow brushes I got a
blending brush I got the one dollar
blending eye brush the one dollar
defining eye brush and the three dollar
blending brush so I think I'm gonna go
in with the blending brush the three
dollar one it looks like that I think
I'm just gonna take this pretty brown
color right there it's like a light warm
tone Brown there's a little gonna fall
out like on the eyeshadows but I'm gonna
see when I put it on my eye oh that was
a lot of fall out I'm just gonna blend
this into the crease see what goes on it
goes on actually pretty dark maybe it's
because I have this other eyeshadow on
top the fallouts not bad under my eye at
all I barely see anything so far I don't
know if I love this blending brush I
think it was kind of the wrong style I'm
looking for so I'm gonna try now going
in with the one-dollar blending brush
I'll try to see if that will work better
in the crease I think it's too like
stiff it's too short we're just gonna
say that's good for the crease but I
want to go in with another color for the
outer V I just want to see how dark do
these shadows gonna get okay I think I'm
gonna take this color and blend it with
this one we're just gonna focus on the
outer V these eye shadows are not bad at
all I just definitely need to blend them
more but I didn't get the right brush
for that this blending brush isn't bad I
just feel like it's weirdly shaped for a
blending brush
I don't know I'm probably just gonna
keep the eyes like that I don't want to
do like a crazy look I just want to keep
it natural and how I would do my makeup
so I can like compare the two you know
to see if like I like doing my makeup
with these products how I usually do it
you feel me so yeah I never used the
defining eye brush so we're gonna use
that right now so I'm just gonna take a
mixture of the dark and light color I
just realized that I usually do this
after I put on concealer but we'll do a
little now and then do a little after
because I already did it
so for concealer I just got this elf HD
lifting concealer I've used her normal
concealers like the $1 one so I wanted
to try this one I also don't know if
this is gonna be my color this is in the
color light gonna put that kind of lines
under my eye
I feel like it's the same color as my
foundation almost put some there it's
definitely the same color as my
foundation is some of their hopefully it
will provide extra coverage if it
doesn't brighten I'm also just using my
beauty blender for this blending it out
okay wow it worked
I don't know we're just gonna leave that
pimple chillin I just don't know I think
it provides pretty good coverage so I
just took this out of the packaging but
it is the elf HD powder and this is a
loose powder this is where the nice
begins if I drop this I like using a
damp Beauty Blender so I'm just gonna
use that oh my god I'm scared oh yeah I
just don't know so I have some on I
don't know if it's enough but I'm just
saying this under the eyes okay wait I
also got this elf mineral powder brush
and I'm gonna take this bad boy out for
this step it's gonna take this put it
under my eyes just like set it in I set
my under eyes and some of the more oily
parts on my face but I also got this
translucent mattifying powder so it
looks like this I guess I'll just use
the sponge it comes with I just set the
powder all over my face and I actually
think it's it's doing a pretty good job
of mattifying me so I'm really quickly
just gonna put a little bit more
eyeshadow on the bottom to finish off
the face before we finish off the eyes
uh-huh I'm just taking this beautifully
bare natural glow face palette and it's
in fresh and flawless so this is what
the colors look like two blushes a
bronzer and a highlighter and I got the
shade light I don't know if it's my
right shade if this is the bronzer looks
kind of light for me but we'll try it
we'll try it anyway so I got this
contour brush too and look at this it
looks like this it looks very legit I'm
gonna try using this I really don't know
if this is even gonna contour me but
let's give it a shot okay I don't think
I'm a fan of this brush just because I
don't know I like to be able to like
spread my contour places like I feel
like if I blend it it's just gonna take
off all the product with it because it's
so like dense I just feel like I don't
have the right accuracy my contour I
don't know if that makes sense
it's gonna be too harsh if I only
that I feel like I'm just gonna go in
with the powder brush and just kind of
blend it and warm up the cheeks for some
reason like it's not blending that well
okay so I'm just gonna use this to
bronze up the face a little bit I just
like the contour I'm not sure if I'm
crazy about it I'm just gonna go in with
the blush I'm gonna take the peachy
toned so the bottom one yeah and I
barely use a blush because of my
pinkness I'm just gonna put a teeny tiny
bit of that I get pink so easily I don't
even need blood
I feel like this contour is just freakin
messing with me okay I'm trying to make
it work and I've given up okay so now
I'm just gonna take this highlighter
let's see let's watch it when I swatch
it it's not super light shiny I'm just
gonna take a little bit on my finger to
put this on the tip of my nose see if we
get that highlight in here I don't
really think we are can you know my nose
it's usually like my nose is the place
where it's like about okay I'm also just
gonna take some on this brush like I can
see the payoff it just doesn't look like
shiny so no very natural I don't want to
contour my nose right now because I'm so
lazy but we're going to I just need this
contour brush see if this works does it
work
if this is a life hack for doing your
nose contour I'm gonna scream because
it's kind of perfect too like I think
that's the face like I think we're done
with the whole face so for mascara I
picked up this three-in-one mascara I
just wanted to try this one out because
I've used the $1 ones but I haven't used
this one I am a mascara junkie so it is
hard to impress me when it comes to
mascaras like it really is so the brush
looks like this okay I'm gonna try this
out I'm scared but my makeup good oh and
I don't curl my eyelashes cuz they're
like super curly already first thoughts
with this it's really wet probably just
because I just bought it but it's pretty
pretty well look at that look at that so
far oh my god okay second coat that gets
clumpy I think I'm actually very
pleasantly surprised with this stuff I'm
just gonna put some of my bottom lashes
- as you can see like Alexa I'm not
talking to you okay this mascara is
actually pretty good as you can see but
it is a little clumpy let's see if I can
show you I really like full lashes it's
pretty good though like I didn't use
that many coats $3 I'm please also
wanted to try this really quickly just
for fun
shape and stay wax pencil what you're
supposed to put it in your eyebrows to
make your eyebrows stay all day and I've
never tried like a wax pencil so we're
gonna try this that I think I am
officially a fan of this product yes
keep my brows in place but make me not
feel like my eyebrows are frozen and
like sticky and I got two products when
it came to lips I got the lip will occur
in natural this just looks like kind of
like a gloss like a nude gloss and then
this one which is the elf aqua Beauty
radiant gel lip tint this is in rogue
radiance I believe I'm gonna swatch the
red right now and just see okay ya know
when i swatched it it looks very like
liquidy I just think that would look
better unlike a lipstick and not just
this on my lips so we're gonna go in
with this one and I'm super excited
about it the one in natural and the
cheaper one when I first put it on it
just did not look cute so I'm gonna try
putting some chapstick round two let's
try this out now I think I'm a fan it's
not as like opaque cuz I thought it was
gonna be but it's still like a really
pretty natural lip gloss I actually I
like this I like this a lot I think it's
a really pretty color good consistency
it's not like sticky it feels good on
the lips I don't know
that's the lips this is the face I'm
just gonna go back in with the aqua
spray and set in my face
I like to fan my setting spray I think
that was a trick I got from like Kim
Kardashian's makeup artist so hopefully
that's a little trick for you and yes
I'm using FIFA when you have guy friends
you gotta have video games in your
apartment it's the thing I just put my
hair in a bun because I'm getting it
died tomorrow and it looks like a mess
to stick with me but this is the
finished look I really like it I know
the foundation doesn't exactly match my
skin it's okay nobody will know now Oh
Lord I'm so delish you know by the end
of filming it's funny I hope you guys
