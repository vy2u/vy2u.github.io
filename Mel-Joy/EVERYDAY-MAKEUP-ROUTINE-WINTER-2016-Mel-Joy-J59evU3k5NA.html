because of microphone problems and it's
like six hours later so if my makeup
looks a little whack
that's why hello my beautiful best
friends so today's video is going to be
my everyday makeup routine and when I
put it in the quotation mark that means
because honestly I don't wear this every
day just because I'm not someone who
likes to wear like this much makeup
every day one that would take a lot of
time and two I'm just home most of the
time doing school work or whatever so
like it's not needed and you can also
tell if you watch my vlogs on my vlog
channel I'm gonna plug this if you
didn't know that I pretty much like
throw on mascara and call it a day when
it comes to my makeup routine but this
is the makeup that I do and I like
actually decide to go out and do
something you know social if you can
tell I'm in a different setup I'm so
excited about this I finally finished my
filming room or like for the most part I
still need to do a couple things here
and there if you haven't seen my filming
room tour unofficial one on my vlog
channel you should definitely watch that
it's for vlogmas and if you want to
watch my vlogs you totally can and if
you don't know if log' misses it's where
i vlog for 25 days my daily life what I
do my vlog channel will be linked down
below and it's also just youtube.com
slash mell doing vlogs I've been having
so much fun with it you guys have been
giving me great feedback and it makes me
so happy so I hope you're enjoying it as
much as I enjoy making them and if
you're new to my channel hello my name
is mal it is great to meet you thank you
so much for watching I would really
appreciate it if you would subscribe it
would make my heart very happy I have
faith you know the button is but anyways
if you want to see how to get my every
day makeup routine then stay tuned and
keep budget so the first thing I do is
put my hair up with a headband and then
I take my Mario Badescu rose water spray
I just spray that all over my face and I
take my baby skin maybelline primer just
up you know prime my face and then I
take the fit me like matte foundation
with a mix of the Maybelline BB cream I
love this mixed together it's like first
of all my skin tone and second of all
like not too cakey and then like also
moisturizing I don't know I've been
loving it so I just apply that all over
I face with my beauty blender my go-to
and then I take my elf lip exfoliator
and just get all that Foundation and
gross stuff off my lips but throughout
doing my makeup it will come back so
I'll be using that again and then I take
my Maybelline age rewind concealer and
fair as a primer for my eyelids and then
I take my tartlet in bloom like in the
bloom palette there we go and then I'm
taking a mix of charmer and flower child
just as like a nude shade to get rid of
all the veins or whatever on my eyelid
then I'm taking a smartypants
with my morphe crease brush and this is
one of my favorite shades ever and I'm
just putting that like in my crease and
also outer V and I'm starting like with
a really light hand with like barely any
product and then I just really start
packing it on there and building up the
color so I would get the desired
darkness that I wanted for this shade
then I'm taking my forever favorite
blending brush from Ecotools it's just a
mini one and I'm just blending all that
out so there's no harsh lines so the
other colors that I apply next like
makes better you know then I'm taking
this darker ish brown color like cooler
toned it's called jet setter and I'm
applying that in my outer V and like
blending it into my crease so just like
blends better with the other eye shadow
color and this just helps add a lot of
definition to the eye and also a little
bit more darkness which was what I was
going for then I'm using the same
blending brush and just blending all
that out then I'm mixing the leader and
activist on like a flat smudger shader
brush but I'm putting that on my upper
lash line to add more definition to my
eye to darken up my lashes you know to
make them look thicker and fuller and I
think this just adds a lot to the whole
look then of course I am blending once
again just making sure everything is how
I want it to look no harsh lines then
I'm taking my Too Faced Born This Way
concealer in light I think this helps
just the whole look so much you're gonna
get the clean line for the eyeshadow I
covered up my dark circles my red marks
whatever I just highlighting aspect you
know I did it all so then I'm just
blending it out with the Beauty Blender
like usual so there was some foundation
in my eye brows and it was like really
bothering me so I decided to do my
eyebrows right now I just comb them out
with a spoolie you guys probably know my
boring I rare routine by now then I'm
taking this
money prep set and go powder but mine is
cracked but it still works though and
I'm just putting this all over my face
to set my face makeup and I'm just using
a kabuki brush from Ecotools to do that
and then I'm also taking my healthy skin
pressed powder from Neutrogena because
this just has a little bit more color to
it so I like to use that where I want
like more coverage then I'm taking
smarty pants once again with a flat
shader brush and just putting that on my
lower lash line this has been one of my
favorite steps to do recently I don't
know I think it adds so much to the look
and it just makes your eyes kind of like
bigger and just pop and I don't know I
love it I'm just cleaning it up with a
Beauty Blender and making sure it's
exactly how I want it and blending it
doing whatever and then I'm taking
charmer from the palette once again and
putting that under my brow bone to add
some definition to my brows then I'm
just combing them out again because I
got a little messed up then I'm taking
this Physicians Formula black eyeliner
and I'm just putting this on my tight
line and then a little bit on my
waterline just a tad but I think this
really just adds a lot and darkens up
the look you know I've said that a lot
but yeah so then the next thing I am
doing is curling my lashes with my Sally
Hansen's eyelash curler and I'm taking
the first mascara and this is the better
than sex mascara from Too Faced this is
like my favorite mascara then the worst
possible thing to happen when applying
mascara happened I just got a ton of
mascara on my face but it's good we
cleaned it up then I'm taking my heart
to extreme essence mascara and this is
like a volumizing mascara so I just did
that for like the volume aspect of it
the last mascara I use is the clump
crusher by covergirl and this just you
know crushes those clumps there we go I
always say that wrong but I'm just
applying that to my top and bottom
lashes this is the only mascara I use on
my bottom lashes because it's like dark
brown so it looks like natural I don't
know I just like the way it looks the
best then to get rid of like the little
residue from the mascara on my eyelids I
just take my spoolie I just like scratch
it off I know that sounds like weird but
like it actually works really well and I
just clean that up with my Beauty
Blender then I'm going in with my
trublend covergirl bronzer and I'm just
bronzing my face with my mini stippling
brush from ELF and I'm just putting that
on my cheekbones like swirling it in a
circular motion and then I'm putting it
on my temples forehead nose on my
jawline then I'm taking this big morphe
brush it's pretty much like a bronzer
brush and I'm just blending that so
there's no harsh lines or anything like
that and then I'm taking my baby my
favorite thing this is the champagne pop
highlighter from Becca and I'm taking
the essence of beauty just like little
brush and oh my goodness like I love a
highlight so I put a good amount of this
on I'll put it on my nose on my
cheekbones a little bit like on to my
forehead as you can see up there under
my brow bone a little a little bit on my
Cupid's bow I just your girl's obsessed
with eye light then I'm taking my powder
and Kabuki brush again and just kind of
putting that where I really want to make
it stand out and not be bronzed I don't
know what I'm saying you get it one of
the last steps is to take my urban decay
makeup setting spray I love this stuff
and I just sprayed this in a tea on my
face and then I'm taking this color pop
lippy stick in skimpy and it's the gloss
kind and I've just been loving nude lips
recently so I've been like super into
that and then on top of that I take the
colour-pop ultra glossy lip gloss and
fairy floss and these two colors go so
well together and that is the final look
so thank you guys so much for watching
