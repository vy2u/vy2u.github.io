be doing my everyday makeup routine for
school this can also just be like a
makeup look for school but I happen to
do it everyday I do change it up
sometimes like you'll see that I'll be
applying some foundation over my
concealer sometimes I don't do that when
like my skin isn't breaking out as bad
or I'm just late for school or I just
don't want to put extra makeup on my
face so there are some things that do
change but this is just kind of the
basic look I'm really sorry for my hair
it's into French braids just ignore that
