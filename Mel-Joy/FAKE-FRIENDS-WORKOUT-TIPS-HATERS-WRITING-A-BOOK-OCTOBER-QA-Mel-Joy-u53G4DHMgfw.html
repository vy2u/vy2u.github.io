on Twitter like in 90% of the time a
couple of you guys requested for me to
do a Q&amp;amp;A and I love doing Q&amp;amp;A I feel
like it gives me an opportunity to check
in with you guys I try to do them at
frequently if you know I'm saying also

answering your guys's questions because
you guys are my best friends my love is
I wish I could talk to you guys in
person
24/7 can't wait till tour oh my god so I
asked you guys to ask me questions yeah
with the hashtag ask Mel joy I'm a
little dysfunctional name if you can
tell then I'm sorry so the first
question is how tall are you and I get
this question so often I am doing no I'm
five four or five five five I don't
remember I don't honestly remember but
I'm one of those what's your favorite
merch item and if you didn't know I
really excited I came out with March
recently I've been working so hard on
this guys like wanted to make everything
perfect and I'm not even done there's
more coming and I'm so excited about it
the link to my merch store is bit dot ly
/ smell joy but the energy are capital
but yeah if you haven't seen it already
my favorite piece is probably the crop
hoodie that's his deuces because I love
hoodies and I loved like croc titties I
think they look so cute and it says
deuces which is one of my Legos the dad
hats really cute too I just tried to
make everything in my collection
something that like I would wear but
also stuff that you would wear like I
personally wouldn't wear a shirt with my
face on it with the dog filter but I
thought hey maybe you guys would maybe I
don't know probably the cropped hoodie
I'm not sure I like that down below if
you haven't seen that already and if
you've bought something you rock
I love you you're amazing make sure to
tag me in a picture on Instagram or
Twitter and I'll retweet babe
like comment DM it's going to go down in
the DM it's gonna be on the next
question is what cheers you ugly I'm
going to be real on it you guys
streaming up if I'm having a bad day
I literally turn to Twitter and I just
talk to you guys I read your comments on
my videos like you guys are like oh my
god just a huge outlet of happiness for
me like it's unreal like you don't even
know really just don't know how happy
you make me so shout out to you guys I
love you umm but yeah
honestly you guys cheer me up just what
it is someone asked I love you what's
your biggest pet peeve I love you more
and my biggest pet peeve who alright
when someone is fake I just not even
like someone being fake like sure you
can whatever be whatever but someone
like fakeness like being fake towards me
that just like I honestly cannot deal
with that I've like learned to wear all
those people away in my life and it is
like a bye no no no don't what you hear
get rid of the fakeness in my life
that's what I've been trying to do and
I've honestly been loving it I just want
to have genuine people in my life that
make me happy I'm going off-topic here
people who like act really fake or users
like people who use people just for
their benefit I just not stand either of
those so so someone asks what do you put
in your burrito I love you I love you to
hit this question so often if you guys
didn't know I am obsessed with burritos
burritos are the love of my life but I'm
vegan so I have vegan burritos and a lot
of you guys like to know what I get in
my burrito so I'm gonna tell you right
now I get Spanish rice or just any the
rice that they have in a Chipotle I'll
get the brown rice because you know I
try to be healthy sometimes I also get
it in a whole-wheat tortilla I get pinto
beans because I like pinto beans better
veggies like whatever veggies usually
it's like grilled veggies or whatever
and they're so good it's unreal lettuce
guac and I think that's it Oh salsa it's
also sometimes someone asked if you were
to write a book would it be about
and honestly I know this might sound
weird I have thought about writing a
book for so long you know what it is I
just I like writing like in general and
I think that I've learned a lot
throughout my life and I know that
sounds like cheesy whatever but I
honestly feel like I am a different
person than I was when I was younger
just because I kind of changed my
mindset and I just changed how I lived
my daily life and I think if I were to
talk about that it'd be kind of
interesting and maybe helpful to people
how to like reach happiness I guess I
don't know
something like that it's kind of a dream
of mine trying to book and then also
just kind of like oh that'd be cool I
don't know what do you love about your
subscribers I love you I love you too
everything about you guys the fact that
you leave such nice comments on my
videos you'll tweet me nice things on my
Instagram the fact that I have you guys
there being my best friends is like
unreal like your loyalty to me is insane
that is something I value in a person so
hardcore like I love loyalty if you're
loyal to me like I will forever praise
you and you guys are so loyal to me and
it like just gives me butterflies it
makes me so happy and you guys are just
so like positive towards media it's just
like having a ton of best friends in
your life that just like give you this
constant supply of positive energy and
happiness and compliments and just like
overall sweetness thank you for being so
loyal to me I love you guys so much you
go on forever about what I love about
you guys and also that you take the time
out of your day to tweet me leave the
nice comments whatever the fact that
like you do that when you be doing
something else like my heart what was my
very first pet's name lots of love from
Australia oh my god that's so cool lots
of love from America so this is gonna be
lowered my first pet was a salamander I
found it at the bottom of my pool so
yeah we saved it and I can end up dying
like a day later though r.i.p we named
it buddy but my first pet was a
salamander it named buddy relatable
what's your advice with fake friends
well I'm gonna do I think a whole video
on this topic because I could talk about
this forever but my advice to you is to
get rid of it get rid of it and I know
that sounds terrible just like Oh throw
your friends out of your life like I'm
not even joking Oh fake people give me
such a bad energy that I don't want in
my life like I know my advice would be
to just nicely remove them from your
life or just don't give them any
attention in any satisfaction in having
attention I don't even know I honestly
think that a life without fakeness and
without people like that is just so much
better as a whole but I mean it's up to
you but that's my advice because I'm
someone who thinks oh I'm not going to
try to change you I'm just going to
change the way that I respond towards
you or how I act toward you because like
it's your life so you can change your
actions but you shouldn't like change
other people so if you are gonna be fake
towards me to be fake towards people and
have like a fake attitude then I'll just
stay away from you that makes
yeah anyways a little ramp but that is
my advice don't even take any of their
BS what do you think of when you go to
sleep oh my god I am someone who um
thinks about everything before they go
to sleep I wish I could just close my
eyes and be asleep I have friends like
that I'll be to sleep over and I'll be
like cake good night good night and then
we'll close our eyes are never to go to
sleep and then two minutes later our
bikes or something like ask them
something and they'll just be dead
asleep but I'm just like what like how
how I honestly lay in bed for probably
half an hour to an hour and I just think
about everything and anything sometimes
it's like video ideas and I like try to
think positively sometimes it's like all
those dark thoughts that you like stow
away during the day and then they just
come alive at night it's like oh my god
please go away
no it honestly depends the day but I I
literally think about everything or like
I'll even just like make stories up in
my head like I don't even know guys it
just goes on and I don't know like jump
from thing to thing I'm still think
about food which will make me hungry
which is like come on mentally you're
about to go to sleep stop thinking about
food but that's a good question someone
asked let's be best friends and girl
we're all best friend you guys always
ask me like hey melaku be friends I
don't see you guys as anything other
than my supporters and my best friends I
don't see myself better oh you guys like
oh I'm like so cool you guys like look
up to me I look down on you and we're
all on Mutual's here you guys are
literally my best friends I talk to you
guys on the daily wave of the question
oh yeah yes you can be my best friend
because we're already all of us it's
just like one big group of best friends
like how dope come on come on someone
asked me what my favorite all-time
singer is I think it has to be black
bear I need a stop touching my hair if
you guys haven't heard of black bear
last bear is who I'm pretty sure I have
memorized every word to every song
Offit's i just plays albums on repeat
over and over and over again music makes
me feel so good I don't know I'm like
happy and just chill and it's a good
time if you haven't checked out black
bears music I would 100% recommend it
three hundred percent twelve hundred
percent a lot of percent this is really
good question someone says advice to
actually see results from working out
and a lot of you guys asked me how I got
in like better shape and I changed my
body a number thing I would 100%
recommend creating a schedule and
creating a routine because doing the
same things like that is going to help
actually go
muscle memory and I say I'm gonna work
out like once a month I'll run one day
I'll do five situps like you really need
to be kind of like consistent with it
and also dieting is so incredibly
important to eating a lot healthier is
something that I 100 set recommend I
think I saw the most results because I
used to work out like on the daily but
eat hay or a bleep and one now that I'm
vegan that's helped a lot but also I
just really changed my habits and insane
amount I started drinking a ton more
water if you follow me on Twitter you
know that I'm literally over hydrated
like I have to like chill on the water
drinking I was like who like why that is
how I saw results and let me know if it
helps you in any way what grade are you
in right now by the way I love you so
much I love you more and I actually get
this question a lot I guess it's just
like I haven't talked about it a lot but
if you didn't know I'm recently
seventeen in August and I'm a junior
people always say Mel she need a senior
and it's not that I should be a senior
my parents have the choice when I was
like way back in pre-k or kindergarten
to put me pre-k or kindergarten like I
got to drive before everyone I was just
get to like make jokes like hey I love
it I do people feel like you going to
the gray Souter I'm like oh my back hot
dog real quick what's the person's you
look up to I have a couple of these I
think my main person and like hero would
be my grandpa or my dad my grandpa did
pass away when he was alive his energy
and just like his attitude is like
surreal like in sane like such a genuine
caring person who is so selfless he
would just ask 24/7 where his wife is
where his daughter is where I was like
he didn't care like how he was he was
just like I want to make sure everyone
around me is okay and I just like value
that so much in a person what people
think about other people's feelings so
definitely my grandpa or my dad because
he's literally the same way even though
they're not related it's kind of funny
my dad is literally my best friend
I mean both of my parents like my best
friend's my dad and I just like are
pretty much like the same person in a
way like it's funny
so I'll literally go to him for any
advice I'll literally go to him and talk
about anything to rant or relay she was
like in saying like he's literally like
my best friend I look up to him a lot as
a person and I think it's really good
advice are probably the two I guess
people in my life that I look up to yeah
how are you so positive about everything
how do you stay positive when you get
hate by the way I love you so much I
love you more it's a really good
question because that's something that I
used to struggle with immensely not even
when I had a YouTube channel and I
didn't
and get hate on the daily from strangers
that I don't even know I just find hate
so funny I used to be a very not very
positive person I'm going to be
completely honest like if I were to
write a book that's what I'd write about
just my life change and how I've gotten
more positive and happier it ever but
now I have such a different perspective
on life and positivity and whatever I
feel that like it's your life like you
should live it the way you want to and I
want to do what makes me happy I want to
make other people around me happy I want
to help girls grow up or whatever and
just like I think YouTube has really
supplied me with a lot of positivity and
happiness we don't know when our life is
gonna be over I'm sorry to get dark so
quickly but like why live your life in
fear and a negative you should live your
life to the fullest like to every last
little second just doing what you love
being happy why would I just sit here
and think about all the bad things in my
life when I can focus on the good and be
happy with what I'm doing and how I'm
feeling you know I could talk about this
forever and also hate like I'm not
amused if I hate unless it's something
that I'm insecure about I kind of like
oh my god you're like someone else like
notices that about me but other than
that I'm just like the fact that you
hate on someone to try to make yourself
feel better and bring yourself higher is
just so low I just don't even want to
give my haters the time of day
like stay positive kids because I love
you I think that's all the questions I'm
gonna be answering because I have almost
a half an hour footage so yawn all but I
love you guys to infinity and beyond I
mean it when I say it and I hope you
know that I will always continue to do
Q&amp;amp;A s even though they're kind of dying
off YouTube because I feel like it's an
amazing way to connect and daily life
close to you guys I guess and just like
a check in and see how I'm doing I want
to see you guys are doing comment down
below how you're doing I honestly want
to know I really do I hope you're having
a marvelous morning afternoon or night
and I'll see you in my next video deuces</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
