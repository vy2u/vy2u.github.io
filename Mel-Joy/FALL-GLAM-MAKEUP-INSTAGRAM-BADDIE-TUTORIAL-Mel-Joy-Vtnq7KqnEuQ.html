moisturize my face with my garden a
moisturizer gonna be taking some of the
baby skin primer I'm trying to make all
my makeup cruelty-free as you guys know
because I'm not vegan but I've had this
for so long I'm just applying this all
over my face to make sure the makeup
lasts all day all day I'm so extra oh my
god I didn't dive in that beautiful BRB
I'm going to take my damp Beauty Blender
and my board in this way am I born this
way foundation by Too Faced is my holy
grail and just apply that to my face do
you guys ever wake up with scratches
like I woke up this morning with a
scratch on my nose I must be just like
Lily no a very violent sleeper we're
just doing that all over my face I can't
talk and do this because I just sound
like a
like a rollercoaster I'm gonna take
another pump because cake face today
we're just we're going full out today
and I said I have my Adam's apple last
video you guys were like Mel you don't
have an Adam's apple I'm pretty sure
every gender has an Adam's apple guys
are just bigger though because what else
would this be I also think I'm gonna
need a new foundation because I'm
starting to get on tan and this was my
tan shade and it makes me really sad
part of going in to fall I'm gonna turn
into a ghost appropriate for Halloween
I'm taking my Born This Way
two-faced concealer if you guys have any
good concealers please comment down
below because yeah I like this concealer
but it hasn't been covering my no sleep
even though I get a lot of sleep
it hasn't been covering my dark circles
recently and I just been inside about it
applying this down in my nose up into
triangle like so and just fill in that
in oh by the way this is in light and my
foundation is in the color nude we're
also gonna put some on my chin for
highlighting a little like this I always
do this in my videos it's like a V then
I'll just extend it cuz Yolo and then
all around my nose my little concealer
Beauty Blender I'm just blending it all
out and this is Dan as well I'm also
gonna try to put that on my recycle I
scratch I'm also gonna be blending this
on my eyelid as a primer just gonna put
a little more or extra highlighter I'm
taking my age rewind concealer and like
there and I'm just applying this on my
mouth I like get really red around my
mouth I also have a little sucker I have
a little pimple I'm up for it
but we're little bits gonna cover that
if we can cuz some pimples are like nope
can't cover it you know working with me
whenever that we're done with that I'm
gonna take my RC ma I'm translucent
powder the no color powder and I used to
use the Laura Mercier one does that
tests on animals and I use this one and
Jaclyn hill and Kathleen lights got me
onto the stuff supposedly it's better
for like dry skin under my eyes I tend
to get really really dry so the Laura
Mercier was like not doing me any good
just gonna bake this under my eyes I was
going to put this on my chin and a
little on my forehead just cuz I've been
breaking on my forehead that's why I put
the concealer this one make sure it
stays there I'm really quickly gonna do
my brows
you guys know my brow routine by now I
literally just take a spoolie with no
product and combs through them someone
asked me for a video to do my eyebrows
and I might do that in a different video
but I'm telling you guys like it's just
it doesn't look cute I don't know if I
add product to them it just looks like
it's a little boy bow we're gonna move
on to the eyeshadow so this is the
closest I can zoom in sori sori sori a
lot of you guys have been asking to see
a tutorial with the tartlet bloom
palette so that's what we're doing today
I'm taking flower child and charmer
together putting that all over the lid
gonna be kind of like the base color I'm
putting it all the way up to my brow
bone and I'm using a sigma medium
sweeper e54 brush just like we talked
about these new brushes I got in the
mail from morphe their cruelty free I'm
so excited about them and then I'm
taking a smartypants with my morphe
don't know something I'll link it down
below
I'm just swirling this into the crease
with a light hand this is just a really
pretty light brown color I'm gonna go in
with this morphe brush it's like a flat
shader brush almost I'm gonna be taking
jetsedder and rebel mixed because ya
know I'm just going to apply that in my
outer V and then bring it up into the
crease and once we're done with that I'm
going to be taking this Lexi brush
tapered blending brush 2 to 9 with the
color leader which is a really dark
maroon color I'm only taking a little
bit of this I'm just gonna put that in
the outer V and blend it into the crease
to add dimension this is just gonna help
darken the whole look up a little bit
but I'm doing this with a really light
hand because this is a really dark color
it just me or does everyone have that
one crease that they like more I like
this crease but I like this crease once
we're done with that once we're done
with that we're gonna blend and I'm just
taking my favorite blending brush
ecotools blending brush the mini one and
I'm just going to be blending all that
out so we don't have any harsh lines
then we're gonna add some sparkle to the
eye so I'm taking my Coastal Scents I
know to brush and taking funny girl
which is the super sparkly gold color
just pack in this oh yeah and I'm
packing this on my lid this is still
shimmery I'm in love I'm also just gonna
be blending this again the fallout is
unreal right now I love the look of like
a hint of shimmer it's my favorite thing
that's all I'm gonna do for the
eyeshadow and then I'm gonna take this
morphe brush and just sweep that under
eye powder and everywhere else I put it
with this big brush from morphe I'm just
gonna apply the powder to the rest of my
face to set everything and then once
we're done with that
when takes this little morphe brush
jetsedder on that and I'm gonna apply
this to the lower lash line I'm not
gonna put too much down here I want to
do enough so the eyeshadows look pretty
connected I guess I don't know um I'm
just gonna be dragging this up kind of
into like a winged form I'm not gonna do
too much of that just because the upper
look is pretty intense already now I'm
taking my Maybelline black eyeliner the
master precise liquid eyeliner and I'm
just gonna be doing the wing I'm
probably gonna speed this up because
wings just you need to focus you need to
focus and I'm gonna try Jacqueline Hills
technique where she takes an angled
eyeliner brush and makeup remover you
clean up the line there's one wing this
is like impossible this eyeliner doing
eyeliner right now look at my hand this
is unlike hardcourt struggling I don't
know if they're even what so ever I'm
just gonna roll with it alright we're
gonna hope these are even I don't know
if they are still trying to master the
Hawaiian earthing I'm gonna be going in
and take my waterproof better than sex
mascara and just put a coat of this on
because I'm gonna be doing fake lashes
today and then I'm taking my glamour
Ardell 135 eyelashes and I've never used
these so let's hope I like them where my
tweets are thought thinking my duo glue
a duo I really need to work on my wings
so I coated them and I'm gonna wait till
they get tacky we're done with one
eyelash what I'm also just going to be
blending it together more
huh okay that one was a lot easier for
some reason Wow gotta proud of myself on
them I'm just gonna be blending in hey
that doesn't look half bad and then I'm
taking so my better than sex mascara I'm
putting up on the bottom lashes and then
I'm taking my clump crusher mascara and
also applying that to the bottom and
then I'm taking my hoola bronzer which
is morphe brush applying this for my
cheekbones Oz and then on my jawline and
then on my temples on my forehead and a
little bit down my besides and my nose
I'm just really lightly doing this
I'm taking my Beauty Blender and some of
the powder and just putting that in a
line of where I want the contour to stop
I'm Becca champagne pop highlighter
Jacqueline Hale love I'm gonna try out
this brush because I've never used like
a highlighting brush this big but we're
gonna try it see how we like it
this brush is from morphe by the way and
I like it I like the way this applies my
highlighter I'm going to put some on my
nose as well now we're happy and
highlighted but I'm also gonna take some
on my finger and just put this under my
brow bone is when the light hits that oh
my gosh it is that's another thing and
I'm just gonna blend that and I'm just
gonna take a big blending brush I'm just
gonna blend this out on the contour
everywhere else and then for the very
last step I'm taking my color pop matte
lip and trap I was torn between which
color to use because I just bought like
so many of these but I love this color
and we're done
also I've noticed my brows really messed
up I'm going to comb through those again

all-nighter Urban Decay I kept sending
