of shoes looking at me over there this
is we're not going oh my god if you see
a dot above my head it's because my
camera hates me
hey guys it's me Mel and today's video
is going to be a haul if you go to my
channel hey I'm Mel it's great to meet
you I would love it if you would
subscribe it would make my heart I heard
very happy I faith you know where the
button is you heard it here first if
there's a second haul video with me
looking the exact same same outfit it's
because I realized I bought way too much
stuff for one haul and I split it into
two if you can tell by the title I went
shopping and r.i.p to my wallet you only
live once
am i right I've been getting ready for
fall by collecting some items from a lot
of different stores and it's try and
haul if I didn't say that so yeah I want
to talk about a website that I've
already talked about on my channel if
you have been on my channel for a long
time than you already know it's uh if
you guys didn't know I get cash back
every time I shop if that makes sense
like online um and some places and
stores - actually it's called ebates.com
yeah every time you have a purchase from
somewhere that Ebates like has cash back
for you get a certain amount of cash
back back Wow
am I making sense be anywhere from like
1% to 10% then they have so many
different deals where it'll be like two
times cash back and blah blah so pretty
much every time I go shopping I make
money I'm gonna sound like I make more
than like I spent but it's like you
still make money like you get a discount
kind of every time you shop which like
I'm obsessed with this website
especially because I love online
shopping so I just thought I'd share
that with you guys and the reason is
because I'm hosting a giveaway or
they're hosting a giveaway but I'm
sharing it with you guys are giving away
- that's for - Sephora gift cards each
$100 oh god I love it and all you have
to do to be entered is to sign up down
below the link will be there and click
the second link down below which will
take you to the giveaway and then you
can put in all your info or whatever in
get entered and just for signing up will
get $10 off your $25 purchase or more by
signing up with the link in the
description box I'll have it like first
link really easy for you guys anyway
we're gonna get on in to the clothes but
anyways why I brought that out
to give away and also because misguided
and things like that half cash back I
got cash bad from bad stuff but I did
give cards so before you attack me in
the comments about how much money I
spend I had a lot of gift cards okay
like a lot like a lot so that explains
that I really don't need to back myself
up I feel like no one needs to back
themselves up when it comes to hauls if
you want to spend your money on clothes
go ahead your money it's your life
do what you want if you're new to my
channel hey hey I already said that I
see these sizes and prices of all the
items in here I'm not gonna actually say
it I'm just gonna put them right here
the size and the prices like I usually
do if you don't want to see the size in
price ignore that but so many of you
guys helped me to this day that you love
it that's why I do it I kind of like
even forget where some of this stuff is
from because I bought too much no I
waited too long I should have done the
haul in between but I was like no I'm
good wait and then I just built up
whitefox boutique calm I'm obsessed with
this web site so freaking cute my
friends over there just sent me some
stuff you know for the new fall the new
fala too called season but they send me
three sunglasses and guys gosh so cute
I'm upset first pair I'm obsessed with
sorry like can we take a moment you're
just like rose gold metallic gotta love
them I love them um what else to say
about these except that I really like
them they're from quite quite Quay you
get the gist the Australian brand
sunglasses brand I've never had
sunglasses from there but I love them
and will probably be buying more these
ones all matte black and people make fun
of me saying that they're really big but
I don't care it's the style okay I think
like Kylie Jenner has these or something
um they are a little big but like I
don't have a lot of big oversized
sunglasses like that so no I'm excited
about them and then this last pair are
these blue metallic kind of ones I think
Kylie has these two actually but these
are so cool I'm obsessed they have
different colors in these blue and
purple II kinda know I don't feel like
mirror yeah they weren't mirror even
though we're going into fall California
still sunny AF so you need eye
protection and I'll link white fox
boutique down below it's so cute guys
like I would come out of ten recommend
checking this website out so then these
pants that I got from them which
boyfriend jeans gotta love them they're
just these light denim boyfriend jeans
ripped distressed so cute so so cute it
just look like
this I'm so excited to rock these in the
fall I think anyone can rock boyfriend
jeans and they're super comfortable
that's why I love them so I got that
first pair but don't worry it is more
then I got this second pair but they're
in black and I don't have any black
boyfriend jeans so I'm really excited
about these what's cool about these is
like the rips are almost in like a
midnight blue if you can see that like
they look a little lighter which I think
looks super cool and these are like
really distressed like we're talking
really distressed but you know I'm into
it I think these go a little higher than
the other ones but still super cute I
love them and then the next thing is
this black bodycon dress and it's like
strappy and has like I don't know what
neckline this is but you can slip the
cool thing about this I don't know like
it looks almost like neoprene or like
spandex see kind of glossy which i think
looks so cool and I have nothing like
this but it's like so thick and such
good quality but I don't know I'm just
obsessed with the material feel like you
could dress this up or dress this down
and just like really excited to play
around with this the next thing is this
faux leather skirt and I'm obsessed it
is so hard finding a script that fits me
like perfectly I don't know I've just
never had good luck with it I don't know
why but I tried this on and it fits me
perfectly like you guys are gonna see me
wearing this so much in fall but it's
just like a pencil skirt pretty much it
it's like faux leather I'm in love I'm
really excited about this I've been
looking for a skirt like this for a
really long time the last thing I'm
gonna show from whitefox is this long
like business kind of shirt but it's
like a dress I think this would look so
cute with like a bralette and some
booties I don't own a lot of things like
this so I thought I would expand my
horizons and try it out I think I'm
gonna be into it I'm really just excited
to play around with new things this fall
you know I love just playing girls
clothes in fashion and everything
misguided first thing is this pink
bomber jacket and it's so girly and so
cute I've kind of drifted away from the
girly phase but this is still like girly
but like not too girly word I just feel
like I it's not my style but like I
really like it has silver detailing and
I got this in a size 2 instead of a zero
I kind of wish I got the zero but like
it's a little bigger which I liked
someone told me to order up on my sky
did so that's why I did that but yeah so
I got this and then the next drag that I
got from misguided I also wish
got this little smaller size but it's
okay like the oversize is in Wade jacket
and it's just light gray and it's like
cropped no no it's really cute it's like
a little biker suede jacket like this
would look cute with like jeans and
boots I don't know
perfect for fall moving on to a sauce I
bought this jacket and if you guys know
I'm obsessed obsessed with hoodies like
it's bad I could literally live in
hoodies so I got this maroonish burgundy
magenta ish hot material is this velvet
velvet jacket with gold detailing it was
one of their like like vintage jacket so
it was like more expensive but I don't
know I feel like it's so cute and like
different and I don't know I like it
from a sauce I also got these jeans and
you guys have been asking like crazy
where these are from
I posted a picture on my Instagram of me
in them and you guys went berserk in the
comments who says berserk they're these
genes from boohoo they're like oversized
boyfriend jeans with these big big rips
here in the knees we're like above and
below the knees and they just cuff at
the bottom I love wearing these with my
hashtag Calvin's you know and like
peaking up a little bit because they
like sit low on the hip I've been
obsessed with these I got a lot of
boyfriend jeans I'm just really into
them from Topshop I just got some jeans
my favorite jeans are from Topshop
because I don't know I just love Topshop
jeans they fit me super well they get me
Topshop just gets me the Topshop moto
Jamie jeans but I got them in a longer
size by like I think two inches because
normal Jamie jeans go like to the ankle
and I wanted them to be full length they
just have rips in the knees and I've
been looking for a pair of black jeans
because surprisingly I don't have any
that like fit me well so I finally
decided to order something off Topshop
and stop hunting in stores I was like
you know what these are very high rise -
I love high rise jeans and then I have
nine pairs of shoes looking at me over
there in the Lord I was debating whether
or not to film a shoe haul and I was
like you know what I have too many
clothes I'll probably split it up into
two different halls anyway and like a
shoe haul that really looks like I just
bought too many shoes at once which
which I did so the first place that I'll
be talking about shoes from is public
desire home by the way a lot of thing
most of these places that I'm talking
about do like follow a Bates but the
first pair of boots I got from public
desire look like this I'm obsessed with
these I bought a lot of food so I'm like
ready
take off ball they're just like these
maroon suede boots
I love maroon I love boots I'm obsessed
with these and literally have no boobs
until these purchases there we go
English mell but then the next pair of
boots from public desire I'm so excited
to wear these I wish they were like a
little higher I thought they're gonna be
a little higher on the leg than what I
tried them on but like it's fine still
very cute pretty much the same as the
red ones except it's not like hard up
here like it's not like firm you know
they're just black booties and I'm
really excited to wear these and it has
a chunky heel like I'm plagued my legs
and then the last pair of boots which
I'm honestly asking myself where am I
gonna wear these I don't know but
they're really cute even if I've to wear
them in my room I still want them like
above the knee yeah I said it dark nope
gray color you see you see them gray
suede boot what I really like about the
heel is that it like darts bigger and
then go slimmer and then it has a little
tie here I'm not crazy about how the
stitching is like lighter but it's so
cute maybe it'll warm up to you yeah I
got these bad boys here's the other one
if you're wondering I did order both I
have two pairs of shoes left stay with
me so the next pair of shoes are these
Stan Smith's but they're the ones with
the red detailing and I have been
looking for these forever like I almost
just got the green or the blue whatever
ones but I waited and I found them and
it made me really happy so then the last
pair of shoes I shouldn't even call them
shoes slippers but I have been wearing
these things like non-stop they're the
Fendi by Rihanna Puma slides and I'm
obsessed I was deciding between the pink
or these ones or the gray ones almost
between all of them to be honest but I
picked the black ones just because
they're the most versatile and I can
wear them with anything honestly I've
been running these things so much I
might get another color just because I'm
obsessed I'd come on um some people will
be like Mel what is on your feet or how
much did you pay those and I'm just like
hey I like them that's what matters so
thank you guys so much for watching that
major haul make sure to sign up for
