regressive dude we're having a start to
the day we woke up at like 1:00 and it's
2:00 now because we did not get much
sleep last night because of Disney World
so we're kind of just hanging out shiny
border burritos I just uploaded the vlog

the past actually like two vlogs um
we're trying to get Mexican food and
order some burritos so we had to call
the place because Mel didn't think that
they had burritos wasn't on the website
it was on the menu
yep so that's basically what we're doing
right now not that exciting
but we'll update you guys later we're
painting your nails watching a movie

boo-boos are like super filling and had
this weird cheese sauce on it that we
did not know what's gonna have on it it
was good that was good and we are now
gonna go to the gym to workout because
we both feel like you know that gross
feeling when you haven't worked out in a
while and you've been eating a lot and
you just like wanna oh my god that's
what we're gonna do so we're about to
leave for another hot day in Florida
the reason Roberto's gym is because it's
super hot so it's not winnable weather
huh no I would not run in this weather
at all I've set a dungeon yes
back Sam I do quite enjoy working out me
too actually
it's also it makes you a lot more tired
at night so if you have sleeping
problems it should work out it does
long finish to work out how was it good
it's like talking to UM and it we came
out and it was raining and a huge
lightning bolt just happened and thunder
really loud so that's for to weather for
you guys so we'll see you at home guys
so we just got back from the gym
ignore me looking gross I just worked
out for an hour and a half for an hour
or whatever but Charlie just went
grocery left to go grocery shopping with
my mom and I'm gonna stay home because I
have a business call regarding my
youtube channel the AMA at 6:30 and at

Sony guys I'm back um I just got off the
call you know what really well the girl

you guys will hear about it later
I don't know if I can share any
information right now yeah so I'm really
except for that and I'm just gonna wash
my face because I just went to the gym
you should always wash your face after
you work out so I decided instead of
taking instead of washing my face that I
should um take shower so I did that and
