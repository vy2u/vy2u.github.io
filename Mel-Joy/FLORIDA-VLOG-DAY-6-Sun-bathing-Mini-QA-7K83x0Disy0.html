video or never buy makeup again for me
definitely not be able to ever buy
makeup again I just would rather make
videos any other day probably never buy
makeup again honestly cuz I don't really
wear that much makeup in general so I
could live without makeup too yeah Alexa

if you're never yourself like no one
really is going to ever be able to like
get to know the real you you're not
gonna make the right friends so just be
like 100 sent you and I know that's
harder than it like just saying it but
just write your hardest be you also what
for me I would say don't let society
trick you into doing someone that you're
not
yeah if they if society is trying to
make you to like wear makeup every day
and dress
away and look a certain way and be a
certain weight and height just don't go
do be you be the way you want oh yeah
the way society I guess like be
comfortable in your own body that's like
it's obviously a harder but don't give
in to kind of like peer pressure and

underscore Garcia ass is high school
difficult and she said PS I love your
channel and also you thank you so much I
love you too high school is difficult
but it's as difficult as you make it out
to be because if you really focus on
your work like yeah you're gonna have
more work because it's high school but
it's difficult but it's worth it
high school is just a lot of fun
personally I think high school is a lot
less project I have everyone's school
yeah and it also depends like if you
stress out about everything and
procrastinate then obviously you're
gonna make it a lot harder for yourself

difficult but do the things that don't
make it harder like harder than it
