video is going to be a super glowy dewy
and natural look I'm obsessed with it I
think it's perfect if you want to throw
in a little bit of makeup but still like
look like you tried I don't know I'm
into it you got that glow you guys know
I love my glow so this look is like the
whole point is look is like to focus on
the face and just like how glowy and
dewy you look I just feel so wavy and if
you're new to my channel hello my name
is mouth it is great to meet you thank
you so much for watching I would really
appreciate it if you would subscribe it
would make my heart really happy and is
a my shoulders up it is but you know
where the button is oh yeah penny watch
today's video is going to be to make it
tutorial oh my god I'm going to make a
tutorial in a hot minute and also I just
really wanted to thank Maybelline for
sponsoring this video I'm just like oh
my god it was such a pleasure to work
with you guys I love you brand so you
just came out with your cushion
foundation and I'm obsessed with it and
the concealer as well to go along with
it and it just gets too glowy radiant
look and that's the whole point of
today's look so it goes along perfectly
so if you would like to see how to get
to this look then stay tuned and keep
watching so I'm starting off with a
clean face but yes I have eyelash
extensions just really because we wanted
to address that and I'm taking my photo
finish primer water by Smashbox and just
putting that on my hands and then onto
my face and then taking my poor
professional primer from benefit and
just putting this on places where I have
the worst pores you feel me and then I
am taking one of my favorites
recently it's a stream cushion
foundation by Maybelline they just came
out with it what I love about it is that
it's like a foundation in a compact but
it's still liquid so it doesn't like
spill everywhere and what I also really
love about this is the buildable
coverage so here what I'm doing I'm just
taking two colors 10 and 15 because I'm
in between them and I'm just putting
that all over my face and I just did one
layer first and then I just built it up
by doing more layers very like flexible
of how much coverage you want which is
what I love about it is the perfect
foundation if you want like a luminous
like fresh face type of look and then
I'm taking the concealer the brightening
cream you can feel and I'm just using
this for primer on my eyelids to get rid
of any of those veins or redness um just
to prep for the eyeshadow and then
taking a modern renaissance palette and
you can't see but i'm taking the color
temporal and i'm just putting this as a
base all over my lid it's pretty much
like a translucent colors and i'm taking
the color Vermeer and it's like a
perfect shimmery champagne color and i'm
just putting that all over my lid just
to like really have that fresh dewy look
on our eyes out it out and then I'm
taking my Sigma blending brush and
taking warm taupe and I'm blending that
into my crease I'm obsessed with this
color it looks so good just in the
crease or wherever so I'm just blending
that and kind of extending it up a
little bit as well and then I'm taking
my tapered blending brush from Sigma and
just blending this all out and then I'm
taking just a flat eyeshadow brush and
my photo finish primer water to add
pigment and I'm taking the color
primavera and I'm just putting this on
the center of my eyelid just to add some
more glow to the look because that is
the goal and I'm just really like
sloppily applying it I'm putting it in
my inner corner and putting it even like
into my crease a little bit we're just
trying to you know bring that shimmer
eNOS everywhere and then once again I'm
just blending everything out and then
I'm taking champagne pop for that last
little bit of glow and I'm putting that
just on the center of my eyelids in
inner corner just to really brighten up
the look and your eyes and also just
blend it everywhere you know we're
having fun with it and then I'm just
coming through my eyelash extensions
with makgulee and moving on to concealer
I'm taking the new dream illuminator
corrector concealer from Maybelline this
stuff is so Bob I chose the wrong color
as you could tell so I picked up the
right color which was the color Clair
because I'm really pale right now and I
put this under my eyes and everywhere I
wanted it to be brighter and more
luminous if you know what I'm saying and
then I'm taking the same concealer but
in the color deep because I'm going to
be using this as a contour a contour
stick and this works so well it's
literally my new favorite thing I'm
obsessed and I'm putting this everywhere
I want to contour to fill my nose my
cheekbones a little bit on my forehead
temples and I'm taking my Beauty Blender
and I'm just blending this all out but
it blends so well into the foundation it
just like all mixed in so amazingly so I
don't know how pleased with the look of
it like can we take a moment to
appreciate how do we and radiant and
I don't know I love it and then I'm
taking the color light which is a color
I use the first segment I'm just putting
that on like little pimples or anything
cuz it's like more of my skin tone and
then I'm taking my Laura Mercier powder
and I'm just putting this under my eyes
with the damp Beauty Blender and I'm
just doing this anywhere that I struggle
with the most like oil and stuff even
though I'm trying to keep this look
pretty dewy so I'm not putting this
everywhere and then I'm taking my Sigma
pencil brush and I'm just taking the
same warm taupe color and just putting
that on my lower lash line I love this
step it adds a lot of definition to your
eyes but I'm keeping it pretty natural
so I'm not singing that much and then
I'm taking my better than sex mascara
from Too Faced I'm just putting this on
my lower lashes just to darken up that
look a little bit and add some dimension
and then I'm taking my shade and light
palette from Kat Von D and taking two of
those contour colors with my small
contour brush from Sigma and just
putting this everywhere I put the
contour stick or the concealer from
Maybelline just to deepen up the contour
and I know I'm making some weird faces
but I'm also just blending it out with a
bigger like fluffy brush so the contour
isn't as harsh and looks more natural
and then I'm taking a fade the champagne
pop there we go from Becca highlight and
I am just oh my god like you can just
mmm you can just see this glow it's add
a lot and this goes so well with the
foundation like I don't know like it
just applied so well I'm obsessed with
all of the face stuff together so I'm
getting excited and then I'm putting
this on my eyebrow bone and but you
would slow and everywhere and I'm just
I'm loving the glow as you could tell
then I'm just taking a eyebrow brush and
brushing out my brows you guys know this
is my brow routine and then I'm taking
this MAC lipstick in the shade from do
nude and then I'm taking the sugar bomb
lip gloss from benefit is little darker
than I remember that's okay I still
think it looks good I just wanted to
keep the lips really natural so I could
focus on the dewy glow enos of the face
and that is the final thank you guys so
