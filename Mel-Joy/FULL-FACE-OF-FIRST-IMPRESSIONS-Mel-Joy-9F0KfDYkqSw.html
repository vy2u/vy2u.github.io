me that glow I I don't I don't know I
don't know what I'm doing hello my
beautiful best friends today's video is
going to be a first impressions of a lot
of makeup pretty much I'm going to be
trying out a lot of products that I have
recently been gifted it so shout out to
all you brands really sweet of you I'm
someone who like sticks to the same
makeup if I like it so I don't branch
out so today I was like I'm a branch out
and I'm a filming and if you're new to
my channel what's good my name is mal if
you'd like to subscribe you can click
the button if you want to sup to UB but
it would make my heart really happy I'm
also really hot and my skin gets really
think really easily so if I'm really
think that's why I also had a lot of
caffeine today like a lot of crappy wear
skinny started put my headband on we're
ready I'm a zoom you win I'm nothing on
my skin except for moisturiser I'm going
to go in with this Smashbox primer it is
the radiance one I use the green one
every day the blue one it's blue here's
the blue hydrating line if you saw in my
favorites video I've been using that and
I love it so I thought I'd give this one
a go I've had way too much caffeine in a
mug shaking I'm gonna put this on my
hands and put on my skin very first
impression of this it's really sticky oh
my god it's really sticky it's really
shimmering I feel you're going to be
blowing ashes it's definitely a very
different texture from the one I use
everyday so it's cool to switch it up
try something new but holy help I look
like I'm highlight all over my face
I'm all for not below you already know I
love glow so I'm kind of content with
this right now it's not as moisturizing
as I would like it to be
just because my skin is kind of dry girl
this is glowy what am I like spray that
I haven't tried I'm just going to go in
with my Smashbox photo finish primer
water it on my face so my makeup stays
I'll then fat is a product I use and
love everyday so I kind of cheated but
it's okay I'm going I'm into this so for
foundation L'Oreal sent me burning
foundation
it is the infallible total cover 24 hour
where you should got two colors because
I don't know which one is my color I'm
going to try to mix these two
going to this crown brush that boxycharm
sent me I've never used I've never used
a brush like this ever so I'm really
excited about it I'm also really scared
not to use my Beauty Blender because
that thing with my drug and I love it so
much I wish you look cute first off the
bat it's super thick it said that it's
supposed to be total coverage but a
weightless feel which like I'm all about
oh my god it's so mu see you see that oh
no this is my colors is not my color I
don't know what is it's so gray oh
actually oh oh okay okay
I'm inches brush I'm like really into
this brush I don't use anything but a
Beauty Blender but this is really nice
and for the foundation um it's very full
coverage I think I like the formula it's
very like blurring I don't know just
makes your skin look really like wallet
I'm like super and since bread I do see
in my dryer spots it's starting to clump
a little bit like Kay Kutta but that's
probably just because I didn't use my
primer that my skin is used to I don't
know I really really really really
really like the brush I actually like
the foundation and it's affordable which
is so dope
so usually after foundation I do my
eyeshadow so I have no clue what I want
to do with my eyes I really I just know
we're just going to put a little bit
more foundation on there I'm too lazy to
use a primer and since I don't have
setting powder I'm just gonna set my
eyes with my Beauty Blender and my RCM a
no color powders but the foundations did
a pretty good job of covering my eye
Bane's because I really spend skin so I
can see my veins whenever you feel like
it
okay so shout out to math you spoil me
with so much holy crap so I'm going to
go in with these what are those too much
crap seeing kids glamorize me I shadow
palette and they're like cream
eyeshadows if you can see that cream so
I'm going to go in with this like light
color as a base okay so this is actually
pretty it's pretty um sticky maybe
that'll make my
focusing on all day I like this color
it's a very pretty champagne gold color
I don't know if it's my eyelids for
purchasing set my foundation well enough
but it's a little patchy here in there
but maybe I just put too much on I just
need to moisturize my eyelids even
though those I don't know if you can see
it but it's pretty I like this a lot
actually nice to eyeshadow palettes I
want to try oh oh this is pretty oh can
I use this one so this is from CIT a
London I could be so wrong about
significant dose that is and I love
these colors I'm upset I'm just going to
use my own brushes I'm going to start in
with both this is hard I don't know what
I want to do okay I'm gonna go I'm going
with this champagne e color right here
with a morphe I shadow brush oh sheesh
these are pigmented oh my god I was not
expecting that wow these are pretty I
really like the combination of the Mac
thing I saw underneath and this on top
this is gorgeous I need to blend a
little bit because I got a lot more than
I needed oh yeah to see that I don't
know if you can see it that well I hope
you can why are my eyes so red more
caffeine cute I'm going to go in with a
mix of this one and this one and blend
it in the crease because this one looks
a little gray for me so I'm going to try
to put some pink and fantasy how that
goes oh my god this gives me such
anxiety because I love my makeup routine
I do everyday I need to branch out
these are super nice I shadow so I've
never really even tried this brand and I
really like them this is really nice I
want to see how much this is I'm going
to try to put all the links for these
products down below as well if I can
find them we're going to hope I can't so
I'm just going to blend that out and I'm
using Sigma brushes right now if you're
wondering I want to like maybe closer to
my lenses and go more so now I'm going
to try taking this brown color with this
little angled small brush and put that
in the outer V to add definition to my
eyes just your very typical matte brown
color I don't know if it's going to go
well with this look I'm creating but
we're gonna hope after we did that which
can blend my makeup would always look
terrible if I didn't blend everything
blending is like the key to success I'm
telling you that by the way that I
getting everywhere it's okay because we
clean it up with concealer later oh okay
we're just gonna we're set up some fun
and I'm going to go in with the gold
color which I don't even know is going
to match this look at all and I just
really want to try it out because I love
gold I'm a sucker for gold I'm just
going to put that on these are so I
really like these eyeshadows all right
so that pink just disappeared because it
is okay we're gonna try to go back with
that pink I've changed my mind being the
indecisive person I am
okay so just kind of mixing these now so
what I do notice about the maxing is
that if you do pile on eyeshadow on top
of it it does add a little cakey but
that's probably my fault because I'm
sending too much fun and I want to put
every eyeshadow on my lid I don't know
what I'm doing we're gonna go in with
this Rimmel London magnifies oh that's
clever let's magnify our shadow
magnified and I really actually like
these colors so that's what they look
like and I'm going to use I don't know
what I'm doing this map round color I
think and put that in the crease
alright this look just got smokey says
you're honestly just hanging with me
watching me do whatever I'm doing to my
eyelids Rick I don't even know what look
I'm going for right now and don't worry
see that we're going to clean that up
real soon okay we're going to go in with
this light gold color at the beginning
of the palette and just put that in the
interview okay these eye shadows aren't
as ah wow it actually really finishes my
brush it literally looks like someone
just like stuck a ton of colors on my
eyeball right now I'm not I'm not into
this eye look I like the colors but not
all together I just got too excited to
Brooke
so I'm going to take some of that just
white and put that on my brow bone at a
clean up whatever look is on my eye
right now it's super shimmery which I
like Matt better but I'm branching out
okay just too much
we're going with concealer now I might
come back later to my eye but we work
for more mistakes okay I'm going to go
in with this infallible total cover
concealer this is from L'Oreal they sent
me to this one that has colors and I'm s
because I don't think of any of the
color one just because that foundation
did a pretty good job of covering my
pinkness because Oh something I'm gonna
go in with the first color maybe an ISO
the first in a second one no no dialed
up my Chinese brush again
so if concealer is not bad I also don't
know if it's my skin tool we're just
going to stick with that concealer it's
all on my chin some on my forehead just
to highlight a little bit some down my
nose and all around my nose mouth area
because I get red everywhere fast it's
actually pretty good coverage I am
starting to take up a bit which I don't
love it all but I mean I am putting
makeup on my face it's getting really
kinky like around my nose but I'm just
going to go on with my setting powder
Beauty Blender and just set that okay
I know this when you set it it loses not
a ton of coverage but under the suit
your life's right now you can really see
everything a lot more clear like it's
kind of scary so I don't like love the
way it looks currently but I'm have to
look off camera setting powder is
everywhere the foundation starting to
get very cakey or crackly or maybe it's
just the primer because my skin is so
dry and I rely on the Smashbox primer to
make my skin matte oh I don't know how
to feel right now then under my eyes I'm
going to do this this same eyeshadow
palette with the dark brown and like
purpley color under my eyes why am I so
red ah whoa that start okay forgot how
pigmented these quick every time we seen
the conspiracy theories on Avril Lavigne
die she let me try to blend this out as
best as I can
I guess you're going for a smoky luck
I'm sweating sweating so we're gonna
know right along so then I'm using this
Mac makeup art rapid black pen ultimate
eyeliner whoa it's just like a really
thick marker and I'm so afraid I'm going
to screw this up this video is copying
so much you guys
okay this is fake this is thick but it's
it's nice oh oh I just like how well has
drawers on since its thicker you don't
have to go over it as much it's an
intense in debating whether I want to go
through the struggle of doing a wing
okay I want to try doing wait we're
gonna try definitely not when we used to
but it makes me this one was good this
this wing treated me well this one gummy
messed up I'm taking an eyeliner off I'm
probably just honestly going to keep it
how sticking it inside there's so
anything but I'm probably just going to
roll with this because I'm over this
take my eyelash curler how did that
already
Wow the island are like coating my
eyelashes black and I'm going to try out
this Rimmel London scandal eyes I just
took it out of the packaging never tried
this I'm really scared because I have a
mascara routine that I love and I stick
with so it's not bad but I am already
missing my better than sex mascara right
Jim not bad it's just not very like
volumizing yeah not my favorite but
should not like product it's coming out
I copied the brushes though can we do
some of the bottom lashes a little hard
to the brush is so big
will you necessary bad good I'm going to
go in with this Mac bronzer I'm actually
really excited to try this this is in
the shade Diana
bronze I could see that so long I don't
know if this is my color
but we're just going to go for it I'm
taking my morphe brush was in my
favorites video I'm just gonna put this
try to blend that out yeah went on
pretty pigmented really pigmented really
pigmented oh god I feel like the
foundation is kind of being rubbed off
right now I'm really trying to blend
this yeah I'm really disappointed right
now because as I'm putting the product
on it's like can you see this
click rubbing off my foundation try
cleaning this up then I'm going to go in
with this Mac highlighter which looks
insane I'm so fat try this I've been
wanting to try this I've been keeping it
for this video it's the oh darling extra
diminished skin finish in like we take a
moment is so beautiful so I'm going to
take a brush this is what I always do a
spray some setting powder on that to get
it dance and then I'm just going to put
this in
I put this on my face you guys know my
writer guy is champagne what a champagne
pop Wow

globe give me that glow I'm going to do
my brows really quickly I'm going to
take the brow gel and this is powder
right here and I'm going to take the
brow got a little thing that kind of
twisted it's like a spoolie and an
angled brush I'm gonna maybe go in with
the middle one and just fill those gaps
I like how small this brushes this brush
is like really just fine because I'm
only fill in my eyebrows a little icing
never fill in my eyebrows but now I just
I don't know I do them a little bit in
this sparser areas for lips I've been
wanting to try this out so bad because
when I got it oh my god it just I'm not
the biggest bright lip person because I
don't love my lip so I don't like to
bring much attraction to them much
attraction doesn't make sense attention
most attentive but this is a matte
lipstick from Mac in calm sheet and it's
just a gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous nude
color I am a sucker for a nude lip so
let's try this out this is very nude
