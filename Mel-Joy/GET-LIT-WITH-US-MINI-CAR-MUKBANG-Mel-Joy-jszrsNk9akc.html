food we're just gonna eat and talk to
you guys while we show you guys some
more songs I'm sorry about the lighting
see I Love Lucy but she's such a good
student that she's always at school too
like 4:30 so whenever you want to film
with her we have to like film later and
then it gets dark so just like blame it
on Lucy but it's because she's a good
student so it's like it's okay she's a
senior I feel like all my senior friends
did but like one wait real quick we
didn't play this song it's tweeted out
as we're waiting for a sec let's play
this song this is my son
the first question is by Miriam first
impressions of each other / how you met
you better answer 7 trying to get in one
of these two names for three years being
loved you both we love you too
I got you I'm so sorry took me that long
I'm like I'm genuinely so sorry it's
like I don't really remember our first
impression because we were like we met
in kindergarten but you were in the
other class so I was just like girls not
absolutely absolutely honey we had an
underground in our class actually just
like oh that girl cause like you were
just another classroom
just that blog my first looking my first
memory of you right now beau
embarrassing oh my god stop what is it
it's a new like maybe two other girls
aren't over they were but like on the
kindergarten line chasing around oh my
god I remember the Ashtabula we love oh
I don't know why but my first memory of
you like I can just picture you this
outfit was like this like magenta shirt
and then like orange couch oh wait and
kindergarten mm-hmm I don't think I was
in control by office what shows are you
currently binge watching love you guys
and we love you too we watched so many
shows together the most recent I'm so
not done with the Teen Wolf
the venture time we watched together
Teen Wolf we watched that what was it
smells
they both watched all of Shame college
yeah right now I'm actually binge
watching Ghost Whisperer cuz I'm like
really into that stuff like I think it's
so cool I'm finishing school I have seen
like three times down so thank you yeah
cuz whenever people come over like we
watch it I'm like yeah I've seen it but
like just all the boys pick a song that
reminds you of each other I have too
many ideas even blackford oh my god
really are you saying like I'm such like
a little like no I heartbroken like I
don't give a okay my car just died
dude like
not like the like feelings part mm-hmm
well like the rest of it you like don't
let them get to you I feel like I used
to let hell against me I'm just
like I can't I don't know but like when
you hear it you think of them or like
the lyrics would be something about like
 boys because you've dealt with so
many anything it's called boy by
Kyle and it's like okay well it's all
about just like get out of your puppies
so like that'd be your song because Lucy
does with a lot of those trust me my god
I didn't you stay in their own lane you
got to go through me hippie oh my god I
need ok favorite quality about each
other I'm gonna get cheesy on you Oh
Lucy's like no I know - nice but has the
biggest heart and like I just like you
know we literally like I don't know bro
middle school like we grew up with SEL
or something but like Lucy like she
always thinks about others feelings
never wants to say something like to
hurt someone like it's not just she like
accident moment she always thinks about
it you're always like you know what I
mean like you never want to like slip up
you never want to like make someone mad
whatever like you just selfless that's
the word that I was like so yeah I never
hear you just talk by yourself for hours
you know what I mean I say that there's
a lot
it's the way you turn like um the fact
she can eat a lot no no mine is that
like you always know how to make someone
like feel their best like you always
like if someone like feels like
like even if they don't you always like
you know how to tell them like the best
things about themselves and like how to
make them like I don't know like enhance
those parts I feel like you brag about
your best friends like I feel like you
always were wrong about me and like I
was gonna tweet about something I'll
tweet it and you don't even know I brag
about you when you're not even there
 you don't like always brag about me
like when I'm there and like that's how
I know that like you're a real friend
like because you do when I'm not there I
got I got all my homies bags if anyone's
like yeah it's like another thing it's
like if someone messes like with your
friends like they're not there I'm got
to go through me
I have a playlist story time that I
might do but your girl got in a little
tussle with security because they were
not I don't know they just because they
were messing with her Friday them I see
with my friends and god I'm literally
zero to a hundred like I won't care and
I'll be like okay whatever like I'll
leave or I'll just be like no like you
know like it was just cuz they were
being disrespectful if you want to see
that let me know I don't know I don't
want to turn into like some drama or
whatever but it was like one of the
craziest things that has happened to me
in a cool minute the bad time oh my god
least thing you like about each other
that's from seeing I don't I don't want
to punch anyone I'm so sorry so what's
your least favorite thing about me so
you know how like a skit I'm not very
good at like like for example if I'm
watching TV I can't be on my phone and
pay attention if it's like a really
intense show like Teen Wolf and so I
feel like a lot of the time Bello is
kind of on her phone in love because
it's like her job you know and so I feel
like a lot of the time what I'm like
talking to you you just don't hear me
are you like don't respond for a really
long time or I just have to say it and
sometimes you're like you're like what
or like you do hear me in the middle of
my story of like are you listening to me
and you do hear it I just don't hear me
because I wouldn't be listening
no I swear to god no I need to be on my
phone and hear you I know I just like
don't believe you oh good you don't know
you have to just be like isn't it weird
the elephant walked in just like like
something exactly something pocket so if
I'm just like uh-huh then you'll be like
bitch and then if I'm like the elevator
you'll know that I'm paying attention
more could just be like can you hear me
sometimes in my own little world I'm
gonna be honest I'm someone who's like
straight up like I'll tell you what oh
yeah I got tell you what I want to do
what I don't want to do and Lucy sings
she's such a person pleaser like
sometimes she just doesn't want to say
like what she wants to do whatever so
Lucy like gonna do this today this is
really like like I barely here yes or no
yeah a lot of the time I just really
don't care though yeah honestly bad like
that's literally the fact that she's
just like that's honestly like a nice
characteristic to about someone like
you're flexible sometimes she's too
flexible I'm like I need answers
give me answers I believe that's all the
questions we're gonna be answering and
also obviously we're gonna be showing
you guys pretty late it's like 10
o'clock Lucia school tomorrow can't let
