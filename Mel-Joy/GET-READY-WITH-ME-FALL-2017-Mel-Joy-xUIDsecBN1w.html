are you guys I hope you're doing good
yes you right there today's video is
going to be a get ready with me and I
have not done one of these in too long
it's been too long so I'm back and we're
doing one pretty much I'm just gonna
show you guys what I decided to do to my
face today to my hair today and what I
decided to put on my body and also
really quickly before we get started in
today's video I just wanted to say a big
thank you it's a clinic for sponsoring
this video I love this brand guys so
much like you don't understand what the
product that I'm obsessed with like
actually obsessed with it is this new
foundation it's the even better glow and
this is light reflecting which is
freakin awesome ever since I started
using this when I go to do my makeup I
got to pick it up I got to use it I got
to put it on my face because it's so
freakin good and if you're new to my
channel what is up I would really
appreciate it if you subscribed and I
fade you know so without further ado
let's just get started
starting with primer of course I am
taking my Mac prep and prime skin base
and just puttin this all over my face
and then chapstick of course
peppermint because I'm already ready for
Christmas then I just sprayed my face
with my L'Oreal setting spray okay
moving on to foundation I need to rant
about this product that is just so good
is the even better glow light reflecting
makeup eye Clinique it has SPF 15 which
is doe delivers the perfect coverage
personally I think for the skin it makes
your skin appear so like radiant and
dewy because the light reflecting pearl
pigment gives you a really healthy just
glowy skin look and a toil free which is
one of my favorite thing and over time
your face will not turn oily and greasy
and gross but you'll still maintain that
glow which is like yes absolutely
obsessed its $28 at any clinic counters
nationwide and it's also available of
course on Clinique calm and wait I'm not
done Clinique is giving away a
foundation to ten lucky winners and one
Lumi iPhone case you can post on
Instagram or Facebook and all you have
to do is comment down below and tell me
how you show your glow and just use the
hashtag even better glow and hash tag
lip by lumi so yeah that's all you have
to do to win and let's continue so I'm
taking a minor screamy concealer and I'm
obsessed with this stuff um but I'm just
putting this under my jawline on
my nose forehead pretty much wherever I
want highlighted on my face and of
course just blending it with my Beauty
Blender and then moving on to eyes I'm
using the same concealer as my eyeshadow
primer because I prefer to use a
concealer I don't know always have but
I'm just setting it with some powder
with my damp Beauty Blender and then I'm
just quickly moving the brows because I
forgot to do them typical me so I'm just
using my Mac eyebrow pencil I'll have
everything linked down below shades all
that good stuff I just kind of fill them
in wherever I think it needs to be
filled in so yeah then for my eyes I'm
taking the lightest color in this
eyeshadow palette and I'm just putting
that all over my lid just to have a base
for the other colors and then taking
this brown eyeshadow that's warmer toned
I'm just putting that in my crease and
blending it out and this is just a
lighter color I'm using in my crease
right now to help transition the other
shades and then I'm taking at the color
sunset in the Tarte rainforest of the
sea palette I just sprayed some setting
spray on my brush to make the pigment
pop and it's just this really gorgeous
gold color like who can resist then I'm
taking marina from the same palette and
I'm just blending that in my crease to
add a little bit of darkness to the
crease you feel me then lastly for
eyeshadow I'm taking the color seaside
and I'm just putting this in the outer
corners of my eye to add more definition
that I'm taking my infallible ro glow
concealer from L'Oreal and I'm just
putting that under my eyes to conceal my
under eye bags because I've been editing
like a dog recently trying to do these
two videos a week so your girl has some
under-eye bags gonna be honest after I
make sure that is all blended I'm just
taking my damp Beauty Blender with my RC
ma a setting powder and I'm pretty much
just setting my whole face just to make
sure my makeup will not move all day
then moving on to bronzer I'm using my
Rimmel London bronzer and I'm using my
morphe bronzing brush and I'm just
pretty much bronzing up my face
I'm just bronzing up my cheekbones my
temples forehead jawline and then I
decided to contour my face a little bit
and I'm just contouring my cheekbones
making it a little more defined and also
just quickly contouring my nose but then
I go back in and try to fix it because
nose contour can be really weird on me
because I have freckles and they like
sometimes show through and then make the
nose contour look uneven so yeah I tried
to work with it but we ended up with
that then I'm taking the same powder on
my Beauty Blender and I'm
sculpting out the face I'm just making
sure I'm bronzed where I want i'm
highlighted where i want all that good
stuff then for highlighter I'm taking my
Mac skinfinish in oh darling this is the
perfect golden toned highlighter it's
just so gorgeous I just oh my goodness
and then I'm taking the warmish Brown we
used in the crease and I'm just putting
this on the lower lash line to once
again add definition to my eyes oh then
I'm taking the voluminous lash mascara
by L'Oreal and the clump crusher mascara
by covergirl and I'm just applying this
to my top and bottom lashes and I like
to put a coat of mascara on the tops of
the top of my eyelashes just because I
think it makes them look way darker and
way longer and just to finish off the
look I sprayed some L'Oreal setting
spray and then there we go this is the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed
and let's move on to my outfit thank you

enjoyed and if you did make sure to give
it a big thumbs up you already know the
drill to leave video suggestions down

infinity and beyond I mean it when I say

afternoon or night and I'll hopefully
