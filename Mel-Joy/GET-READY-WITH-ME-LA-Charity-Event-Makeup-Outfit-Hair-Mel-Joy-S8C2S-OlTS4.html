dropped it oopsies that didn't make
sense we hey guys it's me Mel so today's
video is coming to you from oops a
different location if you cannot tell I
am in a hotel room and I'm in LA my love
I love that life and this video is going
to be a getting ready with me video I am
going to a charity event and I'm so
excited awesomenesstv invited me to go
with them and it is called city air it's
an amazing organization make sure to
check it out but I'm going to that
tonight and I'm so excited I'm gonna get
to do some makeup on some people they
thought I would do a getting ready with
me because a lot of you guys asked for
more makeup tutorials and this makeup
tutorial was very just kind of on the
spot this is the final look and I show
you guys my hair and my outfit as well
so if you guys want to see how to get
this look this hair or my outfit then
stay tuned and keep watching I hope the
lighting is good and I'm wearing a shirt
by the way
so usually I start with my face but
today I felt like being fancy and
starting with my eyes because I was
watching other people's tutorials and a
lot of people seem to do that so that's
why I'm in today I would do my eyes
first so the first thing I'm going to do
is take my age rewind concealer and I'm
just gonna apply this on my eyes kind of
like a base yeah I'm just gonna run that
in I'm gonna do kind of like a natural
look but like you know like I still
tried okay I'm going to take this
Pacifica palette and I love this palette
and I'm gonna take this like nude color
and I'm just going to apply that all
over the lid
and this is almost another makeup
challenge and I just used like a flat
eyeshadow brush from Ecotools I'm going
to take this luck c22 9 tapered blending
brush I'm going to take this one take a
topi darker nude and I'm going to put
that in the crease just to start out
with like a natural crease color and
this is matte and I love
color don't worry if your lines are kind
of sloppy there's a blending brush or
reason I'm not going to blend that in
with a different brush quite yet because
I'm going to still go in with some other
Browns this brown from the Maybelline
the blushed nudes palette this one is
kinda like a coppery toned Brown and
apply that in the outer V and extend it
into the crease I'm just going to take
my ecotools blending brush and blend
this so there's no harsh lines I'm going
to take my finger and this Milani
eyeshadow in the 16th and pack this onto
the center of my lids and this has some
nice shimmer to it so as you can see
just add some shimmer I think it looks
gorgeous and then I'm going to take the
flat eyeshadow brush white color right
here I'm going to apply this in my inner
corner to brighten my eyes make me look
more awake
to be honest I'm sleepy 24/7 and I'm
really sorry if you had to see that in
bundi kind of onto the front of my lids
again I've ever jeez oh my god look it
looks like I actually got sleep last
night I feel a little risky and I'm
gonna make this look darker I'm going to
go in with the flat shader brush with is
chocolate brown right here I'm blending
it on by kind of upper lashline and I
like completely just a tad bit into the
crease taking the same blending brush
blending it up just set on my lid again
just in case I've blended it away like
I'm gonna say for now that we like it
matte black and a little bit of this put
this on my lower lash line we're gonna
move on to the face and then after that
I'm going to do the eyeliner and I like
it's done so the first thing I'm taking
this baby skin primer from Maybelline
whoa I think I took too much and I'm
just gonna apply this all over my face
as a base for the rest of that moving
cup and if I have any you know pores
that are looking rough I'm gonna blend
it down my neck
for the other makeup this makes your
face feel so soft
I'm taking my Amazonian clay foundation
and if you're wondering I'm in light
sand and I'm hoping you still fix me but
you know let's hope the best I'm just
gonna apply this all over base I'm gonna
focus it less here because I kind of
don't like covering my freckles just
because it looks oh no this is a cute
look I just focus it kind of more the
other part of my face and what my
freckles kind of chill I'm taking my
Real Techniques expert face brush I'm
just gonna run to that out and it looks
a little like good thing we've brought
there make sure to blend down your neck
oh that's why I look so pale the
exposures uh sorry huh so really cute
that I really don't like the cake face
look so I'm gonna not do that for
concealer I'm using my Holy Grail
products my NARS concealer in vanilla
trying not to cover all my freckles I'm
gonna doing it in a triangle kind of not
we're just kind of going with the flow
no no like X thingy on my forehead to
Brian and also because I have an acne
scar that yourself oh wow there's a lot
of chin someone we didn't know we're
also going to do some around my nose and
mouth because I tend to get red there so
now I am done I'm just gonna kind of
stipple it out and also just use my
fingers use the ring finger under my
eyes and then blend it I actually don't
know if I like doing my face makeup
after we'll see so learning experience
wow look how well that brighten this is
such a great concealer the exposure
keeps going up camera what you do is
going to blend so I think exposures like
tripping out but I like about doing my
face makeup is that it makes you know
that like I'm going in with my Laura
Mercier translucent loose powder and I'm
going to take a knock off Beauty Blender
whoo apply this under my eyes to kind of
fake it but not not too much like when I
bake too much it like makes me look that
light for the rest of the night I'm just
not trying to look like a ghost also
kind of make it on my forehead my chin
and then I'm taking where are you at
it's still a Kabuki brush we go tools
and apply the powder to the rest of my
face to set that face makeup I honestly
like barely let this bake like I'm
already gonna rub it in this consider is
already like so good like I barely don't
even need to bake also this really weird
spot on my forehead that I always get
really oily right here gonna pack that
in that's my face you can still kind of
see my freckles which is what I was like
kind of going for my barrel use blush
because I'm gonna actually pink person
I'm taking my Lula bronzer with Lexi
2:15 small contouring and I'm going to
oppose you were my chief bonus and then
move it up to my temple also on my new
jaw line doing contour with the small
mirror is really hard
Wow or just Brandon everywhere because I
love looking tan and then I'm taking my
ELF powder brush and I just like to
blend my contour with this because it
makes it look more natural and it's like
you know you know product on this or
anything there's what I do that know my
bronzer with my highlighter and I just
got this guy I splurged I did and I got
the glue kit a first I'm using actually
I'm actually so excited I don't I don't
even know what to do right now let me
take crushed pearl
I'm gonna take my fan brush and I also
brought this little brush that I use a
first trial like a mess not the right
word first impression not very word I
feel like a glowing goddess or something
oh yeah okay I like it and put on my
Cupid's bow down my nose a little bit
they'll be on my forehead oh oh okay
couldn't tell I have eyelash extensions
on I can't use mascara actually I'm
going to take this nude eyeliner I'm
Plata lower lash line make my eyes look
bigger I'm gonna come out my eyebrows
now I don't do anything to my eyebrows
my eyebrows are just naturally thick but
when I do them like it actually looks
terrible I'm gonna apply thin ish coat
the violator
do I do a wing what do I not using the
Maybelline master precise it like bikini
this little wing because I like little
small wings I don't know if these wings
even at all I decided to make the wings
a little longer
not because I messed up I don't know
where join me okay okay a bit messed up
but you know you all have the bad wing
days and I guess this is just gonna be
one of my days then I'm taking my ELF
waterproof going on up - like bottom
left and my tight line so now I'm taking
my wispy kobena brushing through my
eyelash extensions specifically I'm just
going to add some of the white eyeshadow
back to the inner corners because when I
put the concealer on and you know in a
way says to brighten up my eyes I'm just
taking the covergirl clump crusher and
I'm applying this to my bottom lashes
doesn't my bottom lashes a little trick
for you guys if you have like you know
your eyebrow wand and you got some black
stuff on me from the mascara just take
this and it'll come like right off just
in my brow highlight so we're gonna do
that really quickly taking my chela brow
stick I use so much of this and I don't
have a big enough sharpener for this
under my brows I would definitely not
recommend digging I'm doing accuracy of
it you really can't control it that well

powder as well okay
