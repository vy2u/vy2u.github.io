a girls night out look more of a subtle
girls night out look I focused more on a
colored eyeliner I did a nice pop of
color and then the big fuller more
defined lip so I tried to keep it simple
on the eyeshadow yeah this is probably
something that I would wear if I were to
go out with my girls one night this is
what I would wear I'm sorry if the
lighting looks different than it usually
does one of my studio lighting wrote so
I'm just using one right now I'm trying
to experiment with it I don't apologize
it'll be fixed hopefully by next video
yeah anyways this is going to be a girls
night look - there are a couple things I
want to talk about before I start this
video so this video I'm working with
Seventeen magazine to make for you guys
I'm super excited to be working with
them awesome to me it's pretty unreal to
me they sent me a swag bag which was
this adorable bag if that says 17
creator Network on it and they sent me a
bag of goodies I'm going to show you
guys what's in this I use three of the
products in this love and I love
everything I got I'm very grateful so
thank you so much Seventeen magazine for
that now I'm just going to show you
what's in the bag really quickly so the
first thing of course is a seventeen
magazine seventeen magazine with Bella
Thorne looking fierce on it so I'm very
excited this and then the next thing
they gave me was this 3-step Clinique
set the first thing is a face wash the
second thing is a clarifying lotion the
third thing is a dramatically different
moisturizing lotion so I guess that's
intense moisturizing cream this is
awesome I've never used Quinny skin care
products so somewhere set of cheeses and
then the next thing is this eyeshadow
palette this is one of the things excuse
my nails by the way I'm so sorry this is
one of the things I'm going to be using
this is a gorgeous palette this is the
blush nudes Maybelline New York I
actually really like this palette it
kinda reminds me of The Naked 3 palette
but it also has some more earthy tones
like those green in those Browns so I
really like this palette
the next thing that got me was this
Garnier Fructis sleek and shine
brilliant shine glossing spray my sister
had this and I remember using it when I
was littler and I loved it and made my
hair look so shiny and soft so I'm
actually very excited because this is
like a little childhood thing that I can
use again they also sent me this face
wash this is the Neutrogena rapid clear
foaming scrub and this is supposed to
help your breakouts I actually use this
before I what well I actually use this
before I put my makeup on today I have
one of these up but it wasn't the
foaming scrub and I use it all up
because that's how much I liked it so
when I save it is all like what also
this Tresemme make waves hi-def wave
curls
shine enhancing cream so this is a cream
I guess to make waves in your hair and
also shiny waves and very excited to
this because I love Beach ways as you
guys can tell if I kind of sort of have
them in right now I really want to see
how this works I'm very excited to use
and let me know if you guys want videos
on any of these products or anything
like that and then the last two things
first infallible 8-hour
Pro boss L'Oreal Paris in 125 flew this
is also something I used in my tutorial
it makes your lips look so like glossy
and it's not like really sticky or
anything and it lasts very long time and
then the last thing is this rubber girl
plumpify blast pro mascara this is one
of the newest mascaras that cover girls
come out with and I love covergirl
mascaras I kind of stopped using them
for a little bit but when I got this one
sis boom I'm excited tryst and it
actually works really well it was happy
to try out
covergirl again this was like everything
but I used your nose younger I don't
know it's like a little nostalgia

get some free makeup so I already did my
foundation routine if you guys want a
separate video on that you can let me
know down below but I'm just going to
focus on the eyes and the lips so first
I'm taking this champagne base and I'm
just applying this all over my lid to
make the eyeshadows look more more
pigmented so then I'm taking the blush
nudes palette by Maybelline I'm taking
this champagne e pink color and I'm
applying this right on top of the base
and I'm just flying this all over my lid
and in the inner corner of my eyes
and I'm taking this taupe dark nude
color and I'm applying this in my crease
just to define my crease a bit more and
this is matte and I love the look of
matte creases so I'm just doing that and
then I'm just blending that with my
blending brush
already I got this down oh and then I'm
taking this dark rose gold color kind of
almost purpley and I'm just applying
this in my outer V and blending it up
into my crease to darken the look and
add a little bit more color to it
so once I'm done with that I'm just
blending it all again so there's no
harsh lines and then I'm taking this
dark dark black almost color but there's
little specks of purple in it and I'm
just applying this on the outer V and
I'm also mixing it with this lighter
brown color and this is just going to
help darken the look it a little bit
make it look a little bit more intense
and dramatic and I'm also applying this
to my lower lash line just to kind of
add that smoky effect to it then I'm
just blending to make sure all the eye
shadows are how I want them no harsh
lines anything like that and then I'm
also just taking the champagne color
again and packing that onto my lid so
it's more shimmery and then lightly
blending it a little bit more Brown to
get it a little bit more out because if
I wanted it and then I don't shiny white
color just on the inner corner of my
eyes to make me look more awake so
that's the eye shadow so the next thing
I'm doing is I'm just applying this
highlight to my brow just to make my
brows look more defined so I'm just
applying this crayon brow highlighter
and then after that I'm just combing
through my brows so yeah that's all I
did my brows then I'm taking this bright
purple gel eyeliner and I skipped the
clip of me doing it because it took so
long but I just applied a wing to that
on my eyes and then I took this black
eyeliner and I just applied that to my
tight line and lower lash line to just
add a little bit more darkness to the
look then I'm taking my eyelash curler
and my covergirl plumpify blast fro
mascara and I'm just applying this to my
top and bottom lashes and I really like
this mascara so I just did that
so this is a completed I look so then
moving on to it it cut it out but I was
lining my lips with this kind of nude
Bobby color and then I just filled it in
slightly and then I applied this
lipstick on top of it I'm sorry got
caught out but yeah and then I'm taking
the infallible eight hour per lip gloss
from L'Oreal Paris and I applied this
into the middle of my lip and blended it
out to make my lips appear bigger and
that's the completed look I hope you
guys enjoyed this girls night look it is
a more natural girls night out look but
as I know I have some younger viewers
that could wear a makeup like this out
