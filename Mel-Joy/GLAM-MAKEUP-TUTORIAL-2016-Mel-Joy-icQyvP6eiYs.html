going to do is take my glam glow glam

know and then I'm taking my Mario
Badescu
spray I love this stuff I am moving on
to my Holy Grail foundation the Born
This Way Foundation from Too Faced and
I'm applying this with my damp Beauty
Blender I'm in the color nude if you're
wondering and then I'm taking my Too
Faced concealer in light and I'm
applying this in triangles under my eyes
on my chin on this annoying pimple on my
forehead where ever I wanted to cover up
some redness scars whatever you know you
feel me I'm just playing that Weber and
then blending it out with my Beauty
Blender and I'm going back in with my
Maybelline age rewind concealer just
because really like coverage under my
eyes
and wherever I want covered up so I'm
doing that then I'm going back in with
my RC MA no color powder I love this
stuff I'm applying this under my eyes
with my damp Beauty Blender and then
just to the rest of my face with my
morphe just brush so yeah then moving on
to eyes oMG can we talk about these
color pop products though so this is the
color sailor eyeshadow this color is so
dope I'm literally obsessed and then
this color is so pretty you can see I'm
like all over it and this is in the
color muse I'm just applying this into
my crease with my Sigma crease brush and
I love the way this looks together with
the other color and then I'm blending
that with my ecotools blending brush and
I love these shadows so much um and then
this one is la la oh my god so cute I'm
taking my ELF crease brush I think and
I'm applying that in my outer V and like
into the crease and on the center of my
eyelid just kind of wherever I want just
cuz the shimmer like I'm going for the
shimmer look you know then I'm taking
this dark oh my gosh I love it it's like
kind of orangey kind of reddish toned
but it's called bandit from colour-pop I
love this color and I'm just applying
that in my crease as well to get the
kind of fall look we're going for and
then I'm taking my color pop highlighter
and all my goodness this stuff is insane
I'm just applying that for a little bit
more shimmer on the like inner half of
my eyelids because I really wanted that
like shimmer look right there and then
in the inner corner and this highlighter
is in flexitarian and I'm obsessed so

on I put on my bottom lashes you know
the drill and then I'm taking my color
pop super shock cheek and carry on but
I'm using this as a bronzer it's just a
really light warm brown and I didn't
want to like have too crazy bronzing you
know so I just applied that on my
cheekbones on my temples on my jawline
all that good stuff and then I'm just
blending it out with my morphe blending
brush oh when I use my ELF stippling
brush to apply then I'm taking the
flexitarian highlighter my favorite
thing oh my goodness a lot of you guys

been from and this stuff is just insane
