process of getting ready with me you
know I'm the most angry person you will
ever meet
hey guys it's me Mel and today's video I
am going to be getting ready with you
guys you're gonna be getting ready with
me either works you're new to my channel
hey I'm Mel it's great to meet you I
would love it if you would subscribe it
would make my heart very happy I have
faith you know where the button is every
video I try to master it but it's here
and if it's not here I'm actually
disappointed in myself pretty much I got
ready on camera yeah you're gonna get to
see my makeup my hair my outfit all that
good stuff
it was supposed to be like a fall get
ready with me but it was really hot
outside I guess I'm just gonna have to
do another one where I can wear like
actual fall clothing so if you want to
see how I got ready then stay tuned and
keep watching I put my typical headband
on and now we're gonna get started with
the makeup I don't really know what look
I'm going for today so we'll see I
started by spraying my Mario Badescu
racial spray I love this stuff recently
I've been really trying to go for the
dewy look but for some reason I don't
know I've just been like looking caking
I want to put on makeup so I'm gonna try
to do a more dewy look today and I'm
excited we're gonna go in with my glam
glow illuminating moisturizer I've never
used this I probably should use this for
the rose water but it's K I decided I
want to use this I wanna see if this
helps me get a dewy look oh my god it
smells so good what all right moving on
take my trusty Born This Way Foundation
really haven't used anything other than
this recently but comment down below
your favorite foundations because I do
want to expand my horizons I'm going in
with my damp Beauty Blender I'm gonna
apply this foundation all over my face
I'm gonna blend it down my neck as well
one story that and once we're done with
that
I'm taking my Born This Way concealer
I'm gonna get the shape to consider
because you guys recommended it but I
haven't had time go to Sephora yet and
I'm just going to apply this in a
triangle under my eye a little bit on
some pimples I have on my forehead
from now on my changes for a highlight
you know wherever we're having fun I'm
taking my Beauty Blender on the other
side and blending this out we're gonna
put that on my eyelids as a as a primer
I'm also going to take a lighter
concealer and put that on my mouth
because I tend to get really red there
then then then then we're taking my RC
ma no color translucent powder ya know
I'm obsessed with Jaclyn hill I saw in
order for videos that she didn't like
bake it but she like patted it in and
I'm gonna try doing that because my
under eyes have been so dry I don't know
why I'm hanging around but I'm just
gonna have it tap it in and just set it
a little bit but I'm not gonna like bake
it hopefully this will help with the
dryness under my eyes it doesn't help
figure something I'll style didn't go
like that I'm gonna try doing that to
the rest of my face as well if we like
that better
haha don't know if this is the best idea
if I'm trying to look a little dewy but
what are you gonna do what are you gonna
do me I look matte then we're gonna move
on to my eyes so imma bring you a little
closer okay so I'm gonna take this
really really old urban decay palette
I'm gonna go in with the color scratch
right there and hopefully I like it I'm
taking my morphe brush apply that to it
just a really nice like pinky coppery
summary shade a little Pinker than I
expected that it's okay
I'm gonna go in with flower child right
there from the tartlet palette the same
brush and focus that and on the inner
half of my eye these colors look so good
together I'm obsessed so now I'm gonna
take my Sigma e30 8 brush with shagged
from this palette I'm going to be
swirling that into the crease with a
really light hand just for a little
dimension oh wait I wanted to try a
trick not my fav use to Jack the hill
I'm gonna take that powder she focused
it like right there so her eyeshadow
would like make a kind of like winged
cat eye shape so I'm gonna turn it out
because that would save me a lot of time
and I would love that
so life is about trying new things I'm
gonna go back in with that brown color
we're just gonna warm up that crease I'm
gonna take
underground which is right there it's
pretty much out on my Elf contour brush
I'm going to apply that in the outer V
and blend it into the crease just to
darken it up a little bit okay it's not
doing it for me I'm going to take the
tartlet firecracker which is that
shimmer up which is that shimmery Brown
right there I'm gonna focus that on the
outer V where'd you go let's go I can't
find my favorite blending brush I've had
it and then I'm just gonna blend all
that out I'm also just going to take a
flat shader brush from Ecotools and
funny girl the relation marine eyeshadow
again and just put that on just to get
that shimmer back just in case we lost
any of it while we were blending then
we're gonna wipe away this pattern I'm
kind of nervous see if it works
did it work did it work not bad not bad
we're gonna pretend and hope that
they're even and then I'm gonna take the
same flat shader brush a shochet and
shagged again which is just the light
medium brown that we put in the crease
and I'm gonna put that on the lower lash
line I'm the most hangry person you will
ever meet
if I I want an empty stomach like don't
mess with me I'm like not even joking
I'm like so uh yeah when I first wake up
oh you better get some breakfast in me
or I'm gonna be like mmm
once we're done with I am I'm going to
take my mini Marc Jacobs eyeliner hook
you I'm going to apply on my tie line
yeah make her eyelashes appear thicker
darker black or whatever this made my
eyes look really small Wow
I don't think I want to put any of that
on my lower lash line no a little bit a
little bit yeah uh stab myself you know
when you say I'm just gonna have one
slice pizza or one slice cake or
whatever vegan pizza for me
