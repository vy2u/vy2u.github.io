summer edition I've been done I get
ready with me in a long minute like it's
been too long
to a phone working on it I got to do it
and this was also are the most requested
videos that you guys sent to me on my
Twitter when I asked for some video
ideas so pretty much I just show you how
I do my makeup my hair and my outfit for
today if you're watching this and you in
my channel then hello my name is Mel I
just saw myself up how are you it's
great to meet you I would really
appreciate it if you would subscribe you
already know is a you know the bun is if
you want to see more Demeter's means or
anything like that then thumbs up this
video and comment down below so I know
so I can do more in the future and also
a really quick read before we move on to
the video I just really wanted it to
thank you guys for all your love and
support especially because I was just at
VidCon and I met so many of you guys and
it's just so surreal meeting you guys
I'll put the VidCon day 1 blog down
below the other one should be up soon
I'm working on it I'm working on but
yeah thank you so much to everyone who
came up to me with cotton bed words so
so you guys are literally just like
running up to me and hugging me every
positive the best thing ever I don't
know it's just the amount of love that I
fell for you guys it's like insane so I
just wanted to say thank you and I love
you and I always will and you guys my
favorite so if you want to see how I got
ready today for a day in summer it's
been tuned and keep watching
so I already did my brows maybe as you
can tell I really don't do that much my
brows I just kind of fill in the sparse
areas my brows have they're all bit
tricky with me so excited okay I don't
know I don't know I didn't want to make
you all wait for me do Maryborough so my
no makeup except my brush so I'm taking
my Smashbox photo finish primer what
photo finish primer and hydrating you
guys know this is my favorite time where
I use it all the time I'm pretty much
out of it
my mare is corrected oh my god
grow on your six muscles so I'm just
going to apply this all over my face
and down my neck pretty much just
everywhere I'm going to slow so use my
coq10 excuse my own they're disgusting
but work with me here this is why I
never get nail polish because I always
get rid of in like a day or two that's
why I get gel so long about that the
next thing I'm going to do really
quickly is just spray some Smashbox
photo finish primer water so you get
kind of same thing but in a waterfall
tone just going to spray this and I'm
going to tap it in and this just oh my
god my face my face is feeling tacky so
for learning more about makeup I've
really learned that what you put under
your makeups actually makes a very big
difference
once I'm done with that I'm actually
going to try to Indian foundation today
because I'm boring and I don't bring it
out matchboxes every so many foundation
six shout out to you guys you guys are
the sweetest so I'm just going to take
this one in 1.2 and it also comes with
the contour but I'm hoping this is my
shade not the shore so we don't try but
this is the stick foundations is this
one I don't even know how much to like
to apply some ever used to this before
and this is the studio skin shaping
foundations once I have applied all over
my face I'm going to blend it out with a
Beauty Blender let's see if this works
well with the foundation I have
self-tanner on so my neck and my face
doesn't really match my body but that
does try to do it I'm thinking maybe a
brush would work better with this we
won't try and rush okay I got my Sigma
flat kabuki brush and I'm going to try
to just blend this out with this too I
just think like liquid foundations work
better with my skin no it's not bad at
all I don't know if that's my next
favorite what I'm going to do next is
take my NARS creamy concealer or were
you ever in like 2.5 creme brulee I'm
going to put this on my eyelids because
I got some grainy eyelids and then take
my Beauty Blender and blend that out and
this is pretty much just my primer for
eyeshadow also I woke up with a
different crease in my eye today it's a
completely different shape and it
usually and I'm going to put a little
bit of my RCM a no color translucent
powder there we go I'm putting that
and blending it out and I'll move you
closer also shut up March from oh this
is as close as it gets so I'm sorry
we're going off forward so then I'm
taking my naked 3 palette and then I
gave the public let me go down you're
branching out trying a different
eyeshadow palette who I'm not no for
real I like this palette I just can't
relate to like products I really like
and I don't put them down so we're going
to branch out today and I'm going to do
like a rose gold smokey eye maybe so I'm
going to go in with limit like this
light pinky color on the crease I love
just a matte crease so of course I'm
taking my two favorite brushes this is
the Sigma blending e 25 and this is the
tapered blending e 37 now I'm just going
to go back in with a blending brush and
blend it out but also put a little bit
more eye shadow one layer just to get a
little bit more pigmentation what I
wanted so I think about that step we're
move on that's the transition shade
isn't it my beauty guru or what so we're
going to go I was tricked here it's like
the goldish color and I think I'm gonna
put that on my lid I'm going to spray
some settings right from Urban Decay
just to get that pigmentation and the
sparkles and whatever is in this eye
shadow just to bring them out this color
is so ready
so then I'm going to take the color burn
out right here which is like light
shimmery pink and I'm just going to put
that in the inner corner wait for the
brush I'm actually mixing this with the
one next to it it's called dust there's
not a color I love and then I get my
palette for like the outer V so I'm
going to go away with my Modern
Renaissance palette it's absolutely
disgusting I don't know how this
happened so I'm going to take the color
antique bronze it's this one right here
just turn British for a second so I'm
going to take my pencil brush in a 30
from Sigma so we're just going to top
them Tunnel thing and we're going to put
that in the outer V and like work it
into the crease oh this color looks good
with the look I'm proud of this color
choice so now I'm just blending that in
with the other eye shadow I really think
this is like just puts the look together
you know what I mean I just love some
eye shadow in my outer V wow there oh
not so then what I'm just going to do is
and I get dark brown this is in Cyprus
Humber and I'm just going to put this on
my lashline like a little bit just
because I don't feel like doing it
winged eyeliner today and by the way I
just saved a nice I'm like a really
small angled brush that's supposed to be
for your address I'm going to take my
NARS creamy concealer again the same one
and now I'm just going to put this under
my eyes clean up the eye shadow and also
just to makes me look more lives we put
this on my mouth on my chin and on my
forehead give em an itch and you just
scratch it with your makeup I don't even
think the camera is focusing on my face
because it doesn't look like I have a
say so I'm going to take my Beauty
Blender and just blend this out here
take my RCM a setting powder again on my
Beauty Blender and I'm just gonna put
this wherever I put a little concealer
and I'm like semi Bacon semi not I kind
of just like pile it on and then brush
them aside like so then I'm just going
to blend all that powder out so today
I'm gonna and I'm also just going to set
the rest of my stage I don't forget to
set that neck so that I'm going to take
the transition color that I use this for
in the crease I'm just going to put that
under my eye and I'm just going to blend
it out as well to clean up my brows I'm
taking the brow gal a little stick and
I'm taking a matte side and just put in
these put them up Rose and blending it
up I just realized I forgot to put a
night on the camera so the quality of
the sound might be a little psychic I'm
sorry so that I'm going to take my
tweezerman eyelash curler from Sephora
this is Devon because a curl you sadboys
will go this my lash line I'm another
stylish in my eyes I'm touching my
eyeball he knows I got it good so then
I'm going to take my better than sex
mascara and waterproof just gonna theory
makes the curl last longer
I could be trippin but that's what I
think hey Siri tell me a joke alright
and then I'm going to take one more
mascara just one not 5
cuz I used to do that but this is the
clump crusher by covergirl just make
your eyelashes not look clumpy and I
just love this mascara duo so much ah
you really just want some mascara today
I think the wall and then I'm just going
to take this same mascara and put
on the bottom lashes and all I like to
do is take a good double-under thing
like this what is this and take the comb
side that's what's causing them just
brush them out to like not have any
clumps or like axis excess mascara and
then you guys already know my favorite
trick but I take my spoils and I just
cross off any mascara pieces that are on
my face and then to finish off the face
so now that we're done with the eyes I'm
going to take this matte bronzer this is
been my favorite bronzer this is the
Vienna bras in b-17 and I'm just going
to save my big morphe angle of contour
brush lacking you'll and put that on the
cheekbones and my jaw line I'm just
going to blend it out and I'm going to
take the same can encounter I've been
using with this lucky
precision angled contour I'm just going
to put that like where I would want the
contour end my other hairs are getting
all mixed in and then while I wait for
that to like bake or do whatever I'm
going to do my nose contour and I do my
nose contour so sloppy it's disgusting
but then I clean it up a lot so don't
you worry girl real quick I'm going to
blend this out I don't like baking that
much because my face gets dry easily you
know I'm just going to blend out this
nose contour and then I'm taking my
Beauty Blender and just soften that a
little bit I don't like doing a really
nice dramatic nose contour but just a
little one
so then for highlighter I'm taking oh my
god covered in powder I'm taking this
extra diminish skin finish and oh
darling by Mac and can just like take a
moment this is beautiful I'm gonna take
my trusty essence of beauty little duo
thing I've been using this is like sixth
grade to be honest and then I take the
highlighter put that on my nose I also
spray it with setting spray so it would
like really pick up that highlight you
know one fo girl give me a glow instead
on my Cupid's bow
I don't think I'm going to put any under
the brow bone you should I do but I
don't really want to check men I'm also
just going to blend that out a little
bit
I just love glow now of course my Mac
let's explore later I'm just going to
exfoliate them to see some little using
a hoodie that's sturdy to wipe this off
then I'm seeing my Appa for because I
don't know I just asked
we love this stuff for your lips and
moisturize them I'm just going to take
like a new color this is a matte calm
heat and I just put a little on not a
lot so my camera died but I sprayed the
setting spray from Urban Decay all
nighter spray and of it and over that so
now I'm gonna move on to hey are up so I
think I just want to do a high pony for
