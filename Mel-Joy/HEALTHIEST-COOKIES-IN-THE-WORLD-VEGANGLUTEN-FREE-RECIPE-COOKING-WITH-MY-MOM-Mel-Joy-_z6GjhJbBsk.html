making the world's healthiest cookies I
looked up healthy cookies and this came
up and it was world's healthiest cookies
and I was like alright I obviously need
to try this out and I brought my mom
here with me because you guys asked for
a cooking video with my mom because I've
already done one I've done a salad with
you right chicken Caesar salad yes but
now I'm vegan so this is vegan if you
guys are vegan and want to try this now
you totally can
it's a gluten free yes it's gluten free
and depending on how much salt we put in
it could be low salt good for people's
heart conditions Oh any dreams if you
give out that
yeah I've a lot of those on my heart by
the way I just needed to point out
before we get into the video this is a
scar that I just got from burning myself
from trying to make cauliflower a
buffalo wing this is so go Mel if you're
wondering what this thing is on my arms
that is that I hope it doesn't scarf use
some aloe vera from the plant cut it off
and rub it on network you have really
beautiful eyes thanks mom got it from
you so we're just gonna dive into this
recipe with all the ingredients right
here we have one and a half cups of raw
walnut house halves halves did you oh we
just have any we have normal NZ I did
measure them a cup of medjool dates
pitted about 12 a quarter teaspoon of
salt 1/2 a teaspoon baking soda 1
teaspoon of vanilla extract 1 flax egg
which is not an egg don't worry it's 1
tablespoon
of ground flax or chia seeds we're going
to be a big cheese seeds because they're
like more thickening mom says I really
don't know and then three tablespoons of
water to go with that and then 1/2 a cup
of dark chocolate chips and these are
really free so we get it up top it's a
really low ingredient uh what's the word
recipe that's the word you know that
means it's healthy right right easy to
make right you also need a food
processor by the way so if you don't
have that I mean maybe he's like a
blender preheat oven to 350 degrees
which we did and line a baking sheet
with parchment paper or still pad in a
bowl of a food processor but it was an S
blade process the date I've walnuts
together until a crumbly texture is four
so I'm gonna put in a few walnuts
warmoth bada bing bada boom
very much is that a hat a crazy funky
like this if you remember the wizard
waverly place the Hat song oh yeah you
squish those down you're pretty big dick
you like move ten you know alright yep
hi nice we already watched our hands
okay just process the dates until
crumbly textures haven't used crush
if you
the overprocess it can all turn into
mush looks good
just not good enough I got so much
firmer it's my version of a motorcycle
anyway Oh add in the salt baking soda
vanilla and relax and we can go light on
the soft heart don't want you here
yeah low sodium we're gonna try it it
was bad your mouth when you yawn cover
that over that thing should have a hair
up it's a little hairnet oh yeah you do
the baking soda while I do the vanilla
hydration taking the back in another mmm
I guess it'll thicken things up and hold
things together didn't Ernie Vicki yeah
see it's sounding ready is it are you
sure everything's supposed to be in here
no come back
oh wait wait wait wait and then process
again until it's relatively smooth
otherwise we're going to turn the
chocolate chips into nothing you miss
smooth smooth as it's gonna get baby
guess like cookie dough kind of pattern
work that'd be good a nice huh Sergei
see I see but you can anything yeah we
can instant cash you like them with that
every ruling them add in the chocolate
chips and briefly pulls just to combine
see we don't want to turn the chocolate
shipping but you know to turn em into
mush no chocolate bit no you do know
this is real pulsing their combined
maybe one more then spoon the batter
onto a large baking sheet and use your
hands to gently flatten the cookie dough
what your hands and water to prevent
sticking
can you give this in last video I was
like here and then I Dream of Jeannie
gone can you show me actually leaving
and coming I'm gonna be cut out
oh yeah mom climb on my counting on
manners am I right yes is getting a
burrito after this you wait this blade
is super sharp so number one is do not
touch the blade like I'm doing don't
don't don't
I'm wetting my fingers and then we're
going in I don't know how big to make
sense it doesn't makes 12 get a baker's
dozen 13 oh wait no I think we like
almost kind of doubled it because if we
use full full walnuts
not have much and really matter cuz
you're a pre-measured right I guess
there's supposed to be a pretty big
cookie we're just going am I going in
the oven
thanks oh right you're not currently we
are now baking at 350 for 12 minutes or
until the edges are slightly golden so
now we're just gonna wait till the
cookies bake and we're gonna check in
with you afterwards and Melody's gonna
do the dishes
look at that it's gonna be Oh taking
them out of the oven now it's been 10
minutes and are golden brown and the
edges on the edges ooh say we'll burn
them if we leave them on my tongue or
don't you think we're just gonna
a big oven and now we're gonna let them
cool for 10 minutes and also to cool
then we put them on a wire rack a wire
rack and we're letting them cool we're
back and we're mad applaud these are the
cookies oh okay I think they turned out
pretty well I think we could have baked
them a little longer but I don't know
they're little like um soft if you want
them really crunchy I would recommend
making them thinner you know what
cookies in the cookie so ya know do we
have a taste test
