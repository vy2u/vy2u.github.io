is going to be a teeth whitening video
this video was pretty suggested I talked
about a teeth whitening kit in my in my
qa2q days ago and a lot of you guys
wanted to know how it worked if it went
into my teeth or anything like that so I
thought that I would do a video for you
guys the reason I'm doing this video
today is because this is my last day of
the teeth whitening I have to do one
more thing and then the like the
duration will be over of like this set I
guess so it's a 6 day thing so it's the
sixth day so the can I'm going to be
using is high smile I'm just gonna like
talk about the things in it and then I'm
actually gonna show you guys me doing it
as my last my last thing so the things
that are included inside the kit the
first thing is just this little whoa is
this thing that you can see like where
the color your teeth started at the
beginning and then the color and it
ended you can then see how well it
worked and then the next thing is the
actual teeth whitening device I guess
I'm just this little detachable mouth
guard thing I just put in your mouth and
it goes on to the LED light this is LED
light as you can see when I push the
button I'll be like umm just put it in
like so pull that bolt off keep this so
that you're playing about click it go
comes when I ting light 3 3 milliliters
teeth whitening gel one mouth Cheng
whitening shade guide and instruction
manual that's what it comes with the
whitening gel is right here I've used up
two of them as you can see this one
still has half of one because I'm doing
the last day today so that's why there's
half of one left and pretty much all you
do is you put a quarter of each tube and
since it's not like divided into four so
you have to do like
seven like and then a half like one two
five and then a half and then you can
see like there's half of this and you
just apply half on the top half on the
bottom but half of a quarter from here
so this will last you six days then you
put it in your mouth and you let it sit
for 10 minutes do you don't have to time
it or anything because there's a paper
so it'll stop after ten minutes and what
I do is I just like watch TV then after
you're done with the ten minutes you
just washed out to the goop in your
mouth you just wash it out with warm
water you rinse and then you just clean
the trick you just detach it and clean
this so you because this is you know
electronical you don't want to get water
on that and also what I forgot is that
you have to brush your teeth right
before you do it so my teeth already
brushed but you're just supposed to
brush your teeth with toothpaste right
before you do it just you know we get
all the food in then stuff off your
teeth and this kit is usually like $120
I believed I think it's really cute like
the packaging the kit that I'm using is
usually $120 on set for $80 right now so
if you wanted you should get it now
because it's on sale and then you get
like refills they have a teeth whitening
pen and get all that stuff I took before
and after photo so I'm gonna put those
as the thumbnail I personally do see
difference especially in photos oh and
the special thing about high smile is
that it's peroxide free so there's no
harmful chemicals in here so your teeth
will be safe and hydrogen peroxide when
like you use it on your teeth it can
lead to like a lot of side effects and
things like that which is not good and
that's why I like this kit personally is
because it's Rockside free now I'm just
gonna do it and show you guys fun okay
I'm getting the gel I'm looking at it to
make sure if either Iron Mountain I am
applying it in the chopped
making sure I'm doing the right amount
make sure it's evenly apply it also then
we've done the same thing on the bottom
and it also says make sure that you have
none of this on your gums so what I do
is after I put it in my mouth I just get
a tissue and I go over my gums to make
sure that no product is on it all right
so now as you can see it's applied and
I'm just going to put in the mouth and
going to watch um
fit in the lines as I do it and I will
talk to you guys after I'm dead
so he gave money for drug business
so I just went and rinsed out my mouth
and cleaned the tray thing and now I'm
going to take some pictures of my teeth
after and then compare the ones from
before and after you can see if I see a
difference so I'll be right back so I
just took a look at the before and after
photos and I definitely see a difference
my friend told me that she saw a
different I don't know I think that that
kit might work more effectively if you
use it like more times than just one um
but I only used it once and I do see
difference from my beginning teeth
especially on the top and the front too
and I'm happy with the results I think
that I don't know if I'm going to
continue using it or not just because if
it will make my teeth whiter I will want
to but I don't know but I would
recommend this kit to guys and this is a
much safer option than a lot of the kids
out there that's why I wanted to share
with you guys um cuz I want you guys to
be safe I hope you guys enjoy this video
and it was helpful to you guys I don't
know if you guys end up trying this kit

and after on Twitter or Instagram Tumblr
or anything like that and I will
definitely pick those respond comment or
tweet like all that stuff thank you guys
