to be a how I did my makeup in middle
school we're just gonna address the fact
now that I had no eyebrows somehow
someone gave me tweezers Oh No
but like shouldn't've and my eyebrows
went missing oh good job to me I grew
them out we're okay now we're gonna go
back to this time where I had no
eyebrows I really experimented with
makeup I was looking back at photos from
middle school a couple days ago and I
just like started laughing oh my god
like I went in public like this so I
tweeted you guys and I did a poll and if
you don't follow my Twitter you can it's
at module I also got a new and
user name I'm so excited about it I've
been trying to get one for so long it
smelled out joy it's almost smell joy
but we're working our way up we've got
meld joy yeah I asked you guys a poll on
Twitter and you guys said to do it so I
was like okay it's pretty much a
tutorial on how to look like an awkward
face so let's get started so the first
thing I did since one didn't know to
primer was to lotion what actually from
llenos I feel like that was the end of
middle school that's the very end of mmm
I think I did use a Garnier one but I
ran out of it already washing my face
and everything but something I did do
was taking my ELF
oh wait should I bring you closer Yelp
I'll bring you a little closer I took my
ELF blotting sheets because I was too
cheap to buy the five six dollar
Neutrogena ones I had to get the one
dollar elf ones that I don't know if
they work as well but I'll just take one
of these bad boys and I'll just do that
all over my face to get all that gross
oil you know I don't fan so anywho and
then this I remember was my absolute
favorite thing in the whole wide world I
like was all for concealer like I
absolutely loved concealer I swore by it
like that's all I did my in Scenario
take my instant age rewind oh my god
concealer from Maybelline I think I used
like light fare cuz I was literally
paperwhite I don't know I just guess I
didn't get Sun I would take this now I'd
put this under my eyes I do a triangle
now I really don't think I did so I'm
gonna do like half circle also I really
bad acne on my forehead like it was
really bad I think I put some around my
nose my chin I like kind of knew what I
was doing but not really honestly know I
did it and then this part I'm not
looking forward to I blended it with my
finger my ring finger because it was the
most gentle finger that's what everyone
said on YouTube actually think I use a
concealer brush like a couple times I
don't know and then I'm gonna blend it
onto my eyelid as well I miss my Beauty
Blender so much right now how long did
this take me this is taking me like
years so I just remember being like
super white under my eyes and it's super
red on the rest of my face with like
flash and when it got really hot like
right now with all my studio lights on
me I'm like really hot so I get red when
I wasn't hot or something it wasn't as
bad this is what I looked like on hot
days oh my god I don't even know if I
can do this okay I'm moving on so then
for powder oh my gosh this was like my
absolute everything world it's the stay
matte Rimmel London
cutter and I went through like three of
these things I'm using my ELF powder
brush because elf brushes were the only
brushes I bought period and I'm just
packing this so I would stay mad all day
hmm if you guys didn't know I had zero
eyebrows I already said this in the
intro okay well not zero but I just I
didn't have a lot of eyebrows okay it
was the thing I'm really excited for
this step um because I'm going to make
my eyebrows disappear I'm gonna be
taking this L'Oreal True Match I didn't
like really use this a lot because it's
like way too light but the thing one
since I plucked them the part that I
plucked was like Snow White because it
didn't see Sun so it was like not tan oh
this is as bad so oh my god oh my god
and I'm gonna try to cover my eyebrows
I'm gonna trot abort mission
this is ha I don't not a fan nope
my eyebrows are gonna be breaking out is
that a thing I really don't even know if
I'm doing this right like I know this is
a thing to make your eyebrows go away
I'm gonna take my other concealer and
put this on top to try to balance out
the colors if that's gonna do anything I
try to blend it a little bit you know I
can't I can't I can okay yeah honestly
um what okay you can still kind of see
my brows a little maybe if I put powder
on I don't know I tried my best I really
I've never tried to go to my Reza for it
now I'm gonna take ah ah
I used two products to fill my eyebrows
because I had none but I don't think I
realized that too like 8th or 9th grade
and then I started filling them in but
like we're still gonna do it because I'm
not trying to like it wasn't this bad
I used my wet n wild cuz you know such a
cheapo literally didn't buy anything
over $3 um for this Milani one I don't
think I actually had this one no I'm
gonna go in with this one I don't know
if this is gonna work we're gonna try to
get back a little bit of that brow if
they didn't look like this at all uh
also I remember in like ninth grade the
brow product I did use is like too
orange for me like that was a cute 'la
okay they definitely were not this thick
whatsoever they were literally just like
two little lines on my face this is such
a fail on laughing I didn't have a front
part of my eyebrow like that was
anything for me hit me up if you want me
to do your brows this one is too big I'm
trimming
this one a little smaller like this
video if you're cringing as much as I am
right now like I didn't even have an
arch like melt you're being too nice
right now to my eyebrows there we go
that looks a little better I really want
someone to walk in on me right now and
just be like this is too much this is
too much
anyway I'm moving on I would do winged
eyeliner every day what time did I wake
up in the morning I don't know I
remember just in eighth grade I would oh
gosh I would do eyeliner every morning
so I'm going to take my master precise
by Maybelline I think I used this or
like the L of course one dollar liquid
eyeliner the thing that I did with my
wings I would make them really small
like out and then not even at the end of
my eye like before the end of my arm
and it would make my eyes look really
small even my sister was not a makeup
artist not a makeup experts Isis if
you're watching this but like come on
she was like asking me to do her makeup
why would you have to grow with no
eyebrows to do makeup like she did find
my good but she wasn't like super you
know pro and she's like Mel try standing
your wings a little bit like girl they
make your ass really look so into my
makeup I don't know why I don't know why
so I'm just gonna do a line before we
get to the end I'm gonna wing it out
early it wasn't even like this I would
go and now I just go boo I just give it
a little tail like it wasn't even like a
wing was just like that I was being a
little nice right there like honestly
this looks way better like I should have
done this every day so once your eyes
look half the size as they did before
all right we're done we're done we're
done so that's the eyeliner but just
like oh I did call my eyelashes it
really didn't do anything I used like
this NYC ochco that I had for years
years honestly did not call my lashes at
all I don't I'm just like barely gonna
curl them like not even nope it was
still into mascara crazily like I am now
so you know some things just don't
change even though my eyelashes didn't
even look like I was wearing mascara
like it they honestly didn't my favorite
mascara in eighth grade was the they're
real I had the full-size one but I stuff
them anyone right now I'm kind of like
proud of myself that I used like a
pretty good mascara or like I was kind
of into mascaras but I didn't use enough
of it where it like had any payoff but
like it's okay I'm literally gonna do
like not even a coat or okay I'm gonna
do a coat if this is me right now I
would put so much more on but I'm not
going to bottom lashes I did a little
girl I woke on my god oh my god I look
like ahhhh
like myself it no can't can't this is
not okay I looked up and I looked like
myself from eighth grade for like a
split second when it came to blush and
bronzer I really honestly don't think I
did much of either like at all I'm not
gonna do blushes cuz I'm already really
think right now cuz if I used either/or
I would use of course my contouring
blush and bronzer palette oh my god this
thing was like raved about shout out to
you too for teaching me how to do makeup
use this shimmering bronzer we're just
gonna take that and my of course like
three cents forever 21 super good
quality pink tipped brush you know just
what the experts use and I would put
that wherever I don't even think I knew
to put it there we're done don't know I
don't remember if I were to do eyeshadow
oh my god does anyone remember this I'll
use my color tattoo barely branded this
color tattoo Maybelline cream eye shadow
liner whatever I was obsessed with this
stuff but it was like buying gold
because it was like $8 and me who would
just buy tons of elf stuff and be
completely satisfied would be like huh
when I write about this cuz it was a
dollar ladies and gentlemen we hit the
jackpot of course if you're wondering I
did not buy the they're real mascara it
was a Christmas gift because I would not
pay $23 for mascara now makeup is like
the thing I opened way too much money on
also for eyeshadow I kind of skipped
eyeshadow cuz I didn't wear it every day
you know just went for the natural look
as you could tell I would use my walking
on eggshells oh my god from what wow
this thing was like raved about on
YouTube raved about my friend group it
was jazzy thing and of course I just
followed the steps on the thing because
I did not do my makeup or I would go in
with my profusion essential beauty kit I
got this thing I think it Ross for $2.99
I had a lot of fun with this I would
literally go in with any of these colors
of course they were all shimmery I
didn't think I knew matte eyeshadows
existed I thought Matt was for the face
and shimmery was for the eyes also no
highlighter I didn't use highlighter no
but I also just were like a lot of gold
like champagne champagnes
was my favorite type of eyeshadow I were
champagne all the time I would also use
my ELF wet gloss I would and it's the
lash and brow clear mascara I ripped off
the other half because the other half is
a normal mascara cute this is pretty
much empty but yeah it's literally empty
but I would just keep those non-existing
brows in place let when did this happen
I'm sorry I'm sorry then when he came to
lips
I would love experimenting with
colors I can't talk to it I would wear
orange also these are my favorite hot
pink we just we had fun but for school I
kept it you know natural you're lying if
you were not obsessed with this in
middle school this is the Baby Lips that
this is in Peach kiss 30 and it is
literally shimmery peachy color I don't
know if at this eye lips literally just
made my lips shimmering so that's cute
look but does anyone remember back then
body like lip glosses like that was my
like favorite thing three for $15 or
something and I was like yeah like
you're gonna spend five bucks on a lip
gloss you know your girl did it this is
the lip licious tasty lip color pink
grapefruit but I had the vanilla whipped
one oh my god that stuff tasted so good
and I was like kind of a nude sparkly of
course I was really at the sparkle enos
you know but I kind of find it which
made me really sad but you know it's
whatever this was probably my everyday
makeup I'm gonna zoom me out a little
bit we're gonna end this video right now
it's just kind of like a challenge
funnier video type of thing that I did
if you liked it give it a thumbs up and
comment down below so I know um uh-huh

this look but I was in middle school I
didn't wear a lot of makeup everyday I
