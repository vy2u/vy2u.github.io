people I want to sleep blowing my mind
and confusing myself at the same time
hey guys it's me mal and if you cannot
tell by me where you sweatshirt today is
going to be a QA and you guys have are
probably like Mel you looking real bum
right now I was honestly about to get
ready for this video and then I was like
if any video I should be like not dolled
up in it should be this one because
we're gonna be talking about all weight
better make sense because we're gonna be
targeted Wow I cannot talk today we are
going to be talking all about self
confidence and how you should feel
confident in a bun and sweatshirt so
yeah I asked you guys on Twitter with
the hashtag confidence with Mel I think
that is something that in our world
right now is like a huge problem and I
think it needs to be addressed so we're
just going to address it today and I
want you guys to feel confident honestly
that is like part of my whole youtube
channel I just want to be able to help
you guys through growing up because
growing up can be really hard and I want
you to feel confident while doing so if
you're new to my channel hey I'm Mel
it's great to meet you and if you're not
already subscribed I would really love
it if you did so I make my heart super
happy the button is right there I
believe that you know where it is how
can you get more confident in yourself I
think for me at least I try to feel my
best on the outside and on the inside
one I like to take really good care of
my skin and my hair and my body I like
to work out I like to treat myself I'd
like to pamper myself I know in this
world like I don't want to say like oh
you have to feel confident on the
outside to be confident I because that
is not true at all but personally for me
I like to look my best and feel - if
that makes sense breakouts for something
that I struggle with a lot a lot a lot
if you watch my old videos I had super
bad acne along with my bad eyebrows
something that I recently done which i
think is perfect for back-to-school just
because school is something from
Neutrogena which is the salt my acne
quiz so pretty much what you do is you
go to the website solve my acne kohung
it'll be down below in the description
and you pretty much just fill out what
your skin type is like like what you
struggle with things like that and that
quiz will give you a whole
skincare routine from Neutrogena just
like based on what your skin is like I
literally love Neutrogena so when they
asked me to like help raise awareness
about this like I was so down just
because this works and also they're
hosting a giveaway for you lovely people
out there all you have to do is take the
quiz
humming down your results in the
comments section or on social media with
the hashtag let's solve it and I will be
picking five lucky winners to receive
their entire like product routine all
the products that they would suggest
they will get for free like I think
that's pretty dope and personally if you
guys want to know my results I have the
products right here or just traditional
facial cleanser I left in my friend's
house at a sleepover because I'm me but
it's right here I'll insert a picture
right here and it worked so bomb and
then the second thing are these oil free
cleansing wipes and I'm obsessed I had
not heard of these or tried these or
anything I use the makeup remover ones
from Neutrogena and I love them I love
the pink rip through line so I'm super
pumped about these but pretty much like
it's a face wash in a white liquid the
third thing was this lotion which I'm
also newly obsessed with it's this
oil-free acne moisturizer it has acne
fighting ingredient in it but it's also
a lotion so I put this on like after I
wash my face every morning and every
night then the third thing No fourth
thing is this honest spot acne treatment
it's perfect just when you're dealing
with a really annoying breakout which I
get and I want to hear what products you
guys get recommended so comment them
down below and if we get recommended the
similar products well I got really said
then comment down below because I would
love to go so I don't really quickly
share that with you guys because that is
something that I find really helpful to
helping with confidence is feeling
really confident on the outside and on
the inside and I think my skin is
stopping that when my skin feels good
and cleared I feel I feel much better so
let's get back to the questions how do
you overcome insecurities people like to
point out so I've had so many of these
in my life a couple things for me at
least was one when I no eyebrows I got
made fun of and they were called
caterpillars behind my back it was not a
fun
I hope you guys have seen my eyebrows
and also when my eyebrows were full
people get your eyebrows are too bushy
or too whatever and I was like I can't
please everyone and you just have to
know that you can't please everyone you
have to be happy with it if you're happy
with it that's all that matters if I
like my eyebrows like this but I'm gonna
have my eyebrows like this you know when
people like to point them out just look
at them and be like this is me deal with
it if they're pointing out insecurities
they're rude and forget about them
because you just can't listen to them
you really can't and that's like I know
it's hard just to say that it does not
matter what anyone else says about you
your opinion of yourself is what's going
to matter in the long run I also realize
you were perfect the way you are even
with these insecurities up there that
they're pointing out it's not even an
insecurity it's part of you and part of
who makes you you and you should love
that about yourself so someone asked how
I stop comparing myself to others and
start to love myself for Who I am I have
dealt with this issue just because I
feel like almost everyone has because we
live in a world where there's some
really pretty models who have perfect
bodies who have the perfect life like
okay not perfect life but you don't say
and I think that it's really hard for
girls and guys to to compare themselves
to all these other people in the world
because especially with social media
it's so easy to see all these people's
lives so I think that you just have to
realize that you were put on this earth
in your body in your skin and this is
who you are you cannot change that you
can't be them what makes you so special
is because you're you we don't want two
of those other persons this that makes
sense that you're just that you want to
be because they're prettier this or that
like no you're here because you are you
like I can't stress that enough you
can't compare yourself to other people
because you're never going to be then no
matter how hard like you try to be them
and what's even the point of being
another person when you can feel happy
in your own skin be a human being that
no one else has like seen before because
you're you and you're not someone else
originality is so key in this world if
you know it up say what do you do when
people try to bring your confidence down
and that only shows that they're
self-conscious and that they're jealous
or that they're just trying to make
themselves better by putting someone
else down and I honestly think that
that's
gross in a person and if someone has
that aspect of they think that it's okay
to make someone feel bad about
themselves just because they don't like
who they are like nah I'm not into that
so I just honestly say like get out of
my life please that exit is that way you
can't listen to what they say you just
can't and I know it's hard and I really
know that's hard you honestly just can't
listen to them because the only reason
they're trying to bring your
self-confidence down so it brings theirs
up and you can't give them the benefit
of the doubt just kid how are you so
confident and real with your YouTube
channel okay so the confident part sure
yes I believe that I'm confident but
there's tons or I'm not confident I'm
human being guys self-confidence is
something that I've struggled with for a
long time and I feel like everyone
struggles with their life like I'm with
you in this and how I'm real or whatever
is honestly because on my youtube
channel I am me I am a hundred percent
me that's why I've grown this like tight
bond with you guys I mean and I don't
want to be anyone else
I like being real on my youtube channel
because I want you guys to see that like
I think why pretend to be someone else
or not I just surround myself with
people who love me for who I am and I
think that's the best way originality
and being yourself because I know on
YouTube a lot of things occur where
people will try to kind of fit in with
the flow or do whatever but I'm like no
no I'm going to stay true to myself and
do what I believe I don't know I'm a
really ranting person I go on rants I
could honestly rap further but I won't
okay so someone asks how do I stay
confident after I make a mistake and I
actually love this one because I'm
someone who will beat myself up about
something if I feel anything I made a
mistake so how I personally get over it
is I just think hey I'm a person I make
mistakes it's part of life that's how
you grow that's how you learn not to do
certain things or to do certain things
even though you might do something where
you might get hurt in this situation or
you're not happy without one or
something you now know in the future not
to do that if we're scared to make
mistakes then we're not gonna live our
lives honestly so what I would suggest
is learning by your mistakes but don't
be afraid to make mistakes because
that's honestly and help you a lot in
life but I know that sounds funny but it
making mistakes has helped me so much in
figuring out who I am
want to be like how I want to look at
life how I want to act in my life do you
know I'm saying
don't sweat it if you make a mistake
because literally people make mistakes
all the time it's part of life so don't
be afraid to make mistakes someone asked
how can I stop myself from overthinking
if people like me or wanting to fit in
when I feel like I don't so this is a
really good question because fitting in
I feel like is a really big topic they
want to fit in and they want to feel
accepted and they want to find their
friends and things like that
you can't stress about fitting in
overthinking sucks so so much honestly I
have always been an over-thinker like
this video if you're an over-thinker
because I feel your pain you can't
overthink whether or not people like you
or not because you are you and if they
don't like you then screw them like they
shouldn't be your friend in the first
place you don't have to fit in in a
certain way you will find your friends
your whoever that are similar to you
because you're being you I honestly
don't like the whole concept of fitting
in because I don't really think there's
such thing as fitting in I don't know
it's like a weird thing to think about
like oh I have to fit in fit in we're
into your life you're fitting in and
yourself like you are you my suggestion
is to is to not fit in and to love
yourself for who you are and you will
find other people that love you for who
you are as well yeah someone asks how do
you not care about what people think
it's cool love you by the way I love you
too okay this is something that I have
become an expert in because in freshman
year I tried so hard to fit in so hard
to be cool whatever sophomore year I
completely gave no crap whatsoever it
was so funny and that's when I found all
my closest friends that I'm still super
close with to this day and I found all
the right people but pretty much at the
end of my sophomore year I was going to
school almost every day in sweats or
yoga pants my hair in a bun and no
makeup because I did not care I got to
the point where I was like all these
people are here to like do school I'm
not here to impress anyone I actually
find it really funny how much I just
didn't care
these people they're waking up super
early they're sitting in these boring
classes whatever like they're feeling
your
if someone looks you and says oh my gosh
why isn't she wearing a full-face makeup
or why isn't she went like a cute outfit
like really we're here for education
people once again you're gonna find your
crowd with you just being straight up
you you're gonna be with the wrong
people when you're not yourself you're
gonna find yourself in a place you don't
wanna be when you're not yourself
because you wouldn't have been there the
person you're trying to be would be
there I want to sleep blowing my mind
and confusing myself at the same time
but yeah honestly just don't care that's
just what I've realized I'm just like
we're all here for the same reason I'm
not here to impress so someone asks how
do you stay so positive all the time
tips so first off there's a part of
YouTube that you don't really get to see
that little slice of their life where
they're not happy or they're whatever
it's not like I'm gonna sit in a video
and be like having a careful thank you
for calling me really positive yes I'd
like to say I'm a positive person but
I'm definitely not positive all the time
even though I wish I were but you know
these things called like thoughts kind
of get in your head and they're just
like you know that's just part of life
everyone has those days it's just what
happens I think something that helps me
become positive is one that's - I think
living a positive life is the best life
you can live because why would you look
at all the downsides of everything when
you can look at all the upsides if you
know what I'm saying I also think that I
have so much to be thankful for in my
life why not be positive why not keep
looking at the better things because
when you focus on the bad things it's
gonna get to you and you're not gonna be
happy and it's just because it's all
you're thinking it all starts in your
mind you're in charge of your own
happiness and this is what I love
telling people is you cannot rely on
anyone else for your happiness and I've
learned that throughout my years
throughout my years I'm acting like I'm
50 years old no but seriously I feel
everyone is in the end like in control
of their own happiness and if you're
looking for happiness through another
person you're not gonna find it you need
to be there for yourself and I know
that's kind of harsh like yes your
friends can supply happiness your family
can supply your happiness my do like so
hardcore they really do but you need to
be able to be by yourself and be happy I
used to be someone who if I didn't go
out on the weekends if I didn't hang up
friends I would feel like such a loner I
would feel really unconfident I was like
what's wrong with me like why am I not
whatever
now I love my lord uh you're gonna be
with yourself your entire rest of your
life but these other people that you're
trying to find happiness through they
might not be you just don't know
you're stuck in this body for a very
long time you got a prioritize your
happiness I don't even remember the
question I was answering with just
another thing prioritize your happiness
and focus on yourself not saying like oh
I'm gonna do all these mean things to
people to make me happy that it's not
what I mean
whatsoever don't make decisions just
based on other people's happiness I used
to do that a lot too middle school is a
really hard time for me like the end of
middle school beginning of high school
because I focused a lot on others
happiness and like my friends and my
family's happiness and I would
completely forget about my happiness
because I felt like if I made someone
else happy I would be happy in the end
that's not what it was at all it was
like I was just trying to find a
different way to find happiness when
honestly I just needed to find it with
myself and not with everyone else and
also focusing on yourself
thinking what do you need in your life
like what do you need to be happy and to
feel confident if you need a life change
to read got to start working out more I
eat healthy like that's what I did it
has helped me so much there's just so
much you can do to gain confidence and I
can do more videos on this because this
video is gonna be super long just
because I like to read I think in the
end of this Q&amp;amp;A I just want to make sure
that you guys know that one I'm here to
tell you that you can find confidence if
you're not feeling confident right now
too you can find happiness if you feel
like you're not happy right now it's all
kind of like intertwined I feel like and
three you have every reason to be
confident because you're you you were
beautiful the way you are you are no one
else you are not put on this world to be
anyone else
so please please do me a favor and just
be you and embrace it I think I've
learned a lot a lot on YouTube about
confidence and happiness and also just a
lot in my life I think I've matured a
lot in the past couple of years because
of that and just because of the
situation's our I was put in but I
promise you you like find yourself I
guess just takes time takes patience but
just focus on the positives of your life
and be so grateful and count your
blessings I can definitely do more on
this if you guys would like to see that
a lot of you guys have been asking me to
do this Q&amp;amp;A it's been highly
suggested so so we're doing tonight I
love you guys and I want you guys to
know that you have every reason to be
confident and comment down below if this
video helped it all of your confidence
because I feel like it was honestly
rambled you know what I'm just doing me
and that's just what the video was so

beyond and I hope you were having a
marvelous morning afternoon or night and
