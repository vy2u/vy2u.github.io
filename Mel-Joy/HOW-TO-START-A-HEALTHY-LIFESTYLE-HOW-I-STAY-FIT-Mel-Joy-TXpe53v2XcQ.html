don't know what I was gonna say that an
out of ten would recommend I don't know
hey guys it's me Mel today's video is
going to be a very exciting and what's
another word cool video because today
I'm going to talk about how to start a
healthy lifestyle so if you guys are new
to my channel
hey I'm Mel I post videos every single
Saturday if you want to subscribe the
button will be right here so you can be
notified when I do so but if you are not
doing my channel then you know recently
I've gotten into a health kick like a
really big strong health kick I have
just started taking a lot better care of
my body also my interior parts of me
overall I am a lot happier where I am
right now because of this healthy
lifestyle that I started so today I'm
going to be talking all about my healthy
lifestyle and how I started it and how
you can start it so I'm really excited
for this video because health and
fitness is something that I'm really
really into now so I'm excited to
incorporate more videos like that into
my channel and by the way I was having a
really rough hair day so yeah I didn't
want to forget anything so I wrote it
down there's five things that I'm going
to talk about and those five things are
what helped me start a healthy lifestyle
and get fit and all that stuff a lot of
you guys have been asking how I lost
weight or things like that
and this is pretty much how I did that
so I'm just going to be talking about
that and I'm excited let's get started
so the first thing is eating healthy and
I know in my workout routine video I
posted a while back I do a different one
now then I'm going to half up for you
guys very soon so stay tuned for that
in that video I said that I ate anything
that I wanted to but then I just worked
out like every day because I was doing
basketball and I'm so different I
realized that eating healthy is 70% of
being fit and healthy it's 70 30 70
eating healthy 30 working out so the
tips that I have to one make your own
food because if you make your own food
you know what
you don't you're not eating gross
processed food you're not eating
chemicals you're eating everything that
you know that you put in your food I
have been making almost every single one
of my meals every single day now so if
you guys want any recipe videos let me
know and I can do those for you guys so
then my second tip is to have a cheat
day so I know a lot of people think oh
like I'm on a diet
I have to eat this meal every day this
moment like no it's actually good for
your body to switch it up a little bit
so if you eat almost roughly the same
thing every day it's good to have one
day that you have a cheat day a cheat
day where you can go out you'll get your
french fries you'll get your ice cream
you'll get your whatever that you
usually don't let yourself eat you have
one day where you can one because this
day is gonna be a good day and two
because it helps your body because your
body so used to the pattern like you're
eating the same healthy things or
whatever every day so this just helps
your body kind of keep your metabolism
going everything like that so I would
really recommend this just having one
day I like it to be on a weekend usually
like Saturdays and yeah it's a lot of
fun because you feel like it's like a
treat because you're treating yourself
because you're eating so healthy and I'm
like hey I can even ever want so yeah
and then the third tip is to would check
the labels so when you're buying your
groceries make sure to check the labels
not just calories though a lot of people
think it's just calories it's also what
goes into the calories like the sodium
the saturated fat things like that so
make sure to look at the labels because
you could be thinking that you're buying
some healthy food and then you look at
the labels and it's either all like
chemicals or gross things that you've
never heard of or it's not actually that
healthy and it just looks healthy stuff
make sure to check the labels and then
also calorie awareness is another thing
that I started doing more because I see
like outrageously a lot I ate a lot and
a lot of that stuff is not healthy for
me make sure not to go too crazy like
restrict your calories and be like
counting every single calorie you eat
every day because that's gonna drive you
crazy just be like aware of it you know
try to have like a target zone I think
it's around like good job like a 2,000
diet so don't restrict yourself on the
calories but also don't like overdo the
calories you know number two tip is to
work out so this is the thirty percent
of the hundred percent so what I did
this year I got a gym membership and I
did not have a gym membership before
this for like 15 years of my life so if
you guys don't go out buy a gym
membership this doesn't mean that you
can't work out you can still work out in
your room that's what I did that's what
I would always do right a park or
anywhere you know we're running hiking
all that stuff you don't really need a
gym I started going to the gym more
something that I would recommend is
going like right when you wake up in the
morning and then you just feel so much
better throughout the day but I would
wake up earlier and then go to the gym
and do the gym stuff and it was good I
like I like the gym but I'll also make
sure to have a good breakfast before
because I'm someone that just needs to
eat before I workout I can't work out on
an empty stomach and also another tip
for working out is to create a routine
creating a routine is so helpful because
you will stick to that routine and it's
not like you're just going to go to gym
be like I'm gonna workout today and then
you get there nego like what should I do
you know because then you can end up
diddily that didn't do it what did ii
definitely you'll know like what you
want to get done and you can get it done
faster and more efficiently so yeah I
would definitely recommend creating a
routine and I look down because I was
going to say that you could put your
routine in here because then you can
just have it written so you won't forget
it
so then tip number three is to drink
more water so drinking water is actually
so crazy good for you I obviously didn't
realize this I should not drink barely
like any water and now I drink so much
more money than a soup I honestly think
that it helps so much it makes you feel
more like energized and cleansed and
like good and I can't stress it enough
guys drinking water is actually like
really good for you it has a lot of
health benefits like it speeds up your
metabolism it keeps your skin glowing
and healthy and less dry and helps your
bowels I'm not gonna get into much
deeper talk about that and also what I
recommend is lemon water so that's what
I drink a lot of lemon waters really
good for you has a lot of health
benefits but if you don't like lemon
water there's so many things you can put
in your water to make taste better for
example if you like berries you can put
some berries in your water or
you like strawberries but why put
strawberry and lemon ones guys out
recommend it cuz it tasted like
strawberry lemonade or like cucumbers or
mint watermelon peaches you know just go
crazy with it try out different things
and see what you like the best if you're
not someone that likes drinking water
this will definitely help you if you
like fruit too because it just tastes it
tastes so good
so then tip number four is sleep sleep
sleep sleep and this is so important
especially if you are a teenager growing
up girl you need your sleep it's just
you need it so I started going to bed
earlier and waking up earlier and I love
it I have turned into a morning person
like what I used to be a night I will
stay up till 3:30 sleep into like 12 the
next day it just made me feel like lazy
and like unmotivated and I just wanted
to like lay in bed all day but when I
started going to bed at a good time and
then waking up earlier you know like
8:00 and like even earlier sometimes a
little later then I can go work out I
can just get everything done and then
the rest of the day I just feel like so
much more energized and I can get so
much more done I feel much more
productive so that is definitely a big
tip from me at least about how to start
a healthy lifestyle I think sleep is
really important and you should be
getting seven to nine hours at least
a night of sleep I know it's kind of
hard for some teenagers it's hard for me
some days I'm gonna be honest just
trying to make it work just try because
it will benefit you so much in the long
run and in the short run in all the runs
so then the last big tip is number five
and it's to motivate yourself one have a
workout partner have someone that will
go to gym with you and kick your butt
they will push you to do better they'll
make you work your hardest not someone
that will just be like oh yeah I doing
good keep up the good work yet when I
work out with my friends I'm like one it
helps them to it's also fun because you
get to do your friends I'm spending so
much time or also maybe someone that
wants to like eat healthier with you or
just like be healthier you can help each
other stay on track talking about what
meals you can make or what time you're
going to bed or rejig up or just
anything just like there's so many fun
ideas that you can make it like a social
thing you know yep the only so the
second piece of advice is to fill your
social media with motivational things I
don't know what I was going to say there
so for example if you look on my social
media feed they'll be like healthy
recipe
accounts or like Fitness accounts people
like a gyms using weights oh I know what
to do with the gym and then people that
are at home doing like at home workouts
because I have like Coolidge dream
accounts that show you what gets you at
home too so in case I'm lazy one day and
don't want to go to the gym and I love
the food ones because I don't know I
love cooking now like I've become so
much more of like a cooking type like I
said not like a phenom I love cooking
because I started making my own food and
I just realized that I actually really
liked it so it helped me discover
something that I liked doing so yeah
there's so many different social media
platforms that can help motivate you my
favorites are Instagram and snapchat and
Twitter too I love adding personal
trainers on snapchats because they post
like what they're making their clients
do and that's so well full because in
our generation we are on our phones so
much so I feel like this is an easy way
to kind of get into that healthy and fit
lifestyle just because we spent so much
time on our phones if we're looking at
our phones and then we see something
that cannot motivate us we'll be more
motivated yeah that was something that
just would make sense in someone's mind
I really didn't need to explain that so
then the last piece of advice I'm gonna
be talking about under the whole
motivating yourself thing is to have
goals so having goals is so so so so so
important I would recommend writing them
down in a notebook because then you can
just kind of have everything laid out
and you know what you want to do even
writing down like recipes you could try
I do that sometimes and then working out
you could do like a schedule breaking
out like I'm gonna work out three times
a week this week five times a week this
week like boom it'll keep yourself
organized and I cannot stress enough how
much being organized contributes to
having a healthy and fit lifestyle I'm a
more organized personnel and I think
that really helped because then I feel
less stressed and I feel happier because
I'm not stressed and I'm organized up
I'm sorry I'm this is turning into a
rant rambling video so I definitely have
a little journal or notebook whatever
you want to call it like this to write
down your goals or just anything your
to-do lists your schedules of your day I
like making schedules of my day like I'm
going to wake up this time work out from
this time of this and come home just so
I know that I can get what I want done
that day and I won't be stressing and
you know I don't know and then to-do
lists because you can have everything up
here go down there onto that paper and
it's just so much it's just so much
easier and then you can just look at it
and not have to keep everything up here
so that is definitely something that
it's helped me a lot overall I just
wanted to add you guys know that I have
definitely seen a big change in not just
my body but in my personality and my
like feeling my emotions I don't know
it's it's kind of crazy like I just feel
a lot better more confident things like
that and I think having a healthy and
fit lifestyle it's great I'm really
happy with it and that's why I wanted to
share it with you guys even though this
