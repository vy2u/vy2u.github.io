already at a million subscribers okay
honestly I'ma be honest because that's
just who I am
imma be real be for real as I'm filming
this we have not yet hit a million
subscribers but when I post this video
we would have I'm going to LA tomorrow
like early we're talking early in the
morning I'm gonna be in a lace like
almost a week and I was worried that I
was gonna hit it in LA there's no way
that I'm gonna post like a random video
this Saturday like if I had hit a
million subscribers on filming this
video just in case if that makes any
sense but like there's no way that I
would like disregard hitting a million
subscribers I'm like I would have to
post a video and I have to give back to
you guys about this cuz this is unreal I
don't anyways I was expecting to have a
little bit more time to film this video
someone a little all over the place I
was even gonna get some more prizes but
we're gonna have to roll with what we
have I will definitely be doing work
your voice in the future and coming up
or you get into the prices I'm it it's
me I need to rant and his talk like this
is gonna oh okay when I say I am living
my dream I I mean it and that's just
like it's unreal to be able to say that
like since I was a little kid I've
always wanted to grow up and I mean yeah
I wanted to start a YouTube channel I
didn't have the guts to to do it for a
very long time I finally did and it was
the best decision I have ever made
also my eyes are red it's because I got
eyelash extensions today I have insanely
sensitive eyes and just seeing anything
to my eyes just causes in redness or
dryness and it's it's great I just
wanted to create something of my own be
passionate about it do what I love and
try to inspire others and help girls or
guys or anyone grow up feeling confident
in themselves and who they are that's
all I've ever wanted
I've always loved makeup and I've always
loved fashion sells little girl and just
like I'm just a very emotional person I
guess
this is literally I'm gonna cry nope
nope no I thought she said she's you
can't cry you can't cry well I feel like
I have the most supportive and the most
loving and caring subscribers in the
entire world and you guys are literally
my best friends and that's what just
like whenever I go on Twitter I just
talking you guys it's literally just
like talking to a friend I just can't
hang out with you guys every day which
makes me really sad why can't that
happen there's just so much you guys do
for me in my daily life I just wish that
there was some way I could thank you
there was just some way I could let you
know how much you guys really mean to me
and there's there's really just not I
mean it sucks but like I'm gonna give
some prizes away whatever but like
spending money is one thing but also
just like I hope that I have helped you
in some way become confident and love
yourself I just hope in some way I've
helped uhm is kind of a weird thing
because it's like you can't really
comprehend how many people have clicked
that button it's like a million people
I've clicked the subscribe button like
what I wish I could meet every single
one of you guys hug every single one of
you guys like that is just my like
meeting you guys is one of my favorite
things in the whole wide world like I
want you to know that to such a rant and
such a all over the place video I

you to know you're beautiful you are
amazing I love you so crazy much I'm
always here for you hit me up on Twitter
and you have on Instagram like I I am
here for you thank you thank you thank
you for always being there for me just
the amount of love and support and just
everything you gave me just I just
almost groped myself out of love and
support that I get daily from you guys
it's just unreal
it means it means the world I would not
trade this for anything you guys are
just the most amazing people in the
world and that's a rant I didn't mail
you're gonna hate me right now sorry but
I'm just feel like it's not real like a
million people like that's crazy and
just I don't even know like I can't
thank you guys enough for everything and
you've helped me become so much happier
so much of just a more confident
individual more self loving just
everything like that it just thank you I
can't put in words how much you guys
mean to me and I think I've said I'm not
joining million times I'm gonna give it
to the prizes because I already have ten
minutes of footage really really quickly
I do want to
or something because uh spinning posting
video before there's I didn't know that
we would even be hitting a million as
fast like what you don't care about my
veganism you can skip this part and just
go to the prizes and the rules and all
that stuff but if you do care about me
being vegan I'm still vegan but I'm
going to be transitioning into just a
plant-based diet so I'm going to be
eating vegan I'm gonna try my best just
like buy clothing and make a products
that are like don't test on animals but
it's also I've done a lot of research on
it a lot of companies actually don't
just out animals in our like country
they just have some animals of China
where it's like required by law I'll
explain in a different video it's a
whole different thing like a long thing
but some of these products you might be
like Mao that's not vegan friendly just
stick with me I love you don't be mad at
me I'm sorry it all makes sense in one
of the future videos I post soon and I
explain everything but really quickly
wanting to clear that up for all the
people that very much so care about my
veganism because I know some of you guys
treat me like melon you still be good
like I'm checking in with you ok

with the product that I'm giving away
and why you want to win them I'm gonna
start the biggest thing because I'm
jealous so the first thing that the
first winner is going to be receiving is
a MacBook Air and this is the 13-inch
this is the latest model you know all
that good stuff I wanted to get you guys
them refinished recent is the most
recent model you know I'm saying I just
want to get you guys the newest cutest
bestest stuff anyways then the second
thing there's kind of like a technology
giveaway and then like a makeup Beauty
giveaway so this are the new beats and
there's 40 hour battery life like my
beats no offence wherever you are
they just they die I'm not in 40 hours
um but anyways these are the newest ones
the solo 3 Wireless and I just got the
special edition black they're the matte
black ones cuz I'm the matte black ones
and I was like we could join but if you
really just can't stand have matte black
headphones then literally I'm totally
okay with going in or turning them and
exchanging them for the color you want
when the email be like man can you
change them to the goal of opinion
change into the white and I got you but
I just thought I'd get the matte black
ones kids like my blog is dope
I personally think so that is the first
giveaway like technology issues and then
the second giveaway is going to be like
the beauty type of stuff and I'm like
really oh I love makeup the first thing
is this Mia Clarisonic fit and I have
one of these and I am obsessed with it
and I thought that it would be a nice
thing to get you guys because I know a
lot of my viewers are like growing up
and going through puberty and everything
and people break out and I hate breaking
out it happens so lots of Austin's and
it's just part of life this is gonna
help keep your skin clean and clear yeah
it's Clarisonic you wash your face with
it if you don't know what it is and it's
really awesome so then I got you some of
my favorite makeup products this is the
Porefessional primer and I actually
recently just got this but I'm obsessed
if you haven't seen my what I got for
Christmas video self brother was my last
video and then I got you also another
thing I've been recently loving the
modern renaissance palette from Anasazi
of Beverly Hills this thing is gorgeous
such blendable eyeshadows like gorgeous
shimmery shades gorgeous matte shades
this is just all-around amazing palette
so I thought okay that I actually have
not tried this I was going to get the
cat Mundi contour kit but they didn't
have it and I was on a time crunch
I've been really wanting to try this and
I know a lot of people rave about this
as well so this is the Too Faced cocoa
contour chiseled to perfection it's
pretty much a contour kit but it smell
like chocolate like take a moment and
there's also a little highlight in here
though ya know and then I got you the
Urban Decay long-lasting makeup setting
spray all night or when I swear by this
stuff I feel like it really just does
make a difference when it's like your
makeup lasting I'm all for it so I
thought I would get you and I'm actually
about it on that one so you get myself
one too then I got you my all-time
favorite mascara I've given away the
waterproof one I think in one of my
giveaways before so I thought I would
get you the normal one hands down one of
the best mascaras I've ever tried in my
entire life and I'm a mascara feet well
mascara I hope you enjoyed as much as I
do
oh so good then I got you this set of
chubby sticks because I wanted to get
you guys like lip something related but
I didn't want to pick out like just a
couple of products cuz like everyone
likes different color lip products so I
just got you two set so I didn't have to
like try to pick out a color it
literally comes with so many I'm a cat
ready 2020 benthic bake day a lot of
colors from Clinic if I hadn't already
said that but then I also just threw
these in here because I feel like if I'm
really stressed out I just want a bath
have a face mask and I'm just like two
whole new me just a whole new me I have
these I would get them but they're
disgusting because they're stuff all
over it because I've just used them a
lot oh but this one is the avocado in
oatmeal clay mask this one is the Dead
Sea minerals anti stress mask have used
these since like middle school with my
friends like for sleepovers and stuff so
it's got to be kind of like a cute thing
so that is everything the second winner
is going to be receiving actually for
the makeup one there's probably going to
be a highlighter in it because I didn't
have time to get one I was going to get
the champagne pop like I can't find it
anywhere
so we'll probably get you like some type
of highlighter yes I will some type of
amazing highlighter because you know I
love my glow like I have to I have to
include that I think that concludes it
for this video maybe I'll do something
like really cool for like a different
video for like Kitty 1 million I don't
know your girl might be going skydiving

much I love you guys and appreciate you
