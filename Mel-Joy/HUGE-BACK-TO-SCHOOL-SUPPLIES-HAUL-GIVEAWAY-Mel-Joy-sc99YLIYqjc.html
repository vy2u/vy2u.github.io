hey guys I got you new blends who did
hey guys it's me Mel today's video is
going to be at my first back to school
video I know we're probably having mixed
emotions I know I mean one back to
school is actually like a really fun
time for a lot of fun videos and -
because school is school I made a sign
that said back to schooled Mel I know my
handwriting is bad I've been made fun of
for my handwriting for very long time so
we're just not talking about it before
we get started I really quickly wanted
to tell you guys that I got APO box and
so many of you guys have been asking me
to get one and I finally got one so you

my focus but today's video is going to
be a back-to-school supplies hauls and

be given away to one of you lucky
winners out there stay tuned to the end
to hear all the rules and stuff yeah no
messing in my channel hey I'm AM L nice

you guys are crazy I love you guys you
know what the button is I have faith in
you
and also just like a little giveaway if
we subscribe so like special just you
know do it now okay so without further
ado I think we should started I kind of
went crazy rather be safe than sorry I
don't know what you guys use of the
stuff on them dad did the first thing
I'll just show you guys
that wasn't I just got you a pink binder
and this one is the one and a half inch
binders is what I like to do in schools
have like one big binder full all my
subjects not like twelve different
binders just gets to be too much yeah
it's a baby pink I think it's super cute
and we have a theme guys are trying to
get everything to match you're gonna be
like rockin when you go back to school
while you're matching school supplies
the second thing to go in the binder are
these adorable it's come on file folders
and there's nine of them there's so many
cute different designs in here you can
put in your binder to help divide your
subjects come on
good a second thing is also just more
dividers I had to have these for PE of
all subjects who know some teachers
might make you have the boring one so I
got the boring one and then the next two
things are two folders I sky you purple
and white you put these in your binder
to it just have them I got you guys
paper for the binder you can put in the
binder we got some lined paper about you
college because that's what I like
hopefully you do and then I got oh oh
and then I got you graph from that so
you got these there's a hundred sheets I
think in each yeah I got you with some
note book these are for like classes so
this one is 150 sheets and a three
subject and what I like about these
things like dividers so you can have
like different subjects within this if
your teachers let you share like
notebooks within other subjects this
will be super good to have because
that's what I like to using to normal
notebooks this one is this pretty main
color it matches it all matches like
that swirly print if you go and say this
one's just black because you gotta have
that lacing back look but you gotta have
that basic black notebook everyone has
it you do and these are the one subject
ones so then this I just kind of got for
fun and also if you need a composition
but I got you if you're a five-year-old
at heart like me you'll like how its
coloring because I liked it and I was
like so see this cool design you can
color it in I was excited about it I
hope you're as excited about it
I got a hold on the bag of really random
supplies hopefully you will end up using
so the first one is just this paper no
paper mate yeah that's a time to say
bold vibrant lines eight assorted ink I
don't really know what I'm trying to get
at they're colored pen you got the gist
and you can use that to color in your
notebook the next thing is a super cute
stink blur and it's a mini stapler and
this is perfect because you don't know
how many lines I've had to waited to
staple my papers because I don't have my
own stapler and I have to share with the
class
now you can be that cool person that
will like have a your own line like at
your desk because everyone will want to
use your stapler so yeah and even the
staples are mint and I think that's
adorable and then the next thing which
honestly the main reason I got it is
because it looked really cool but
they're these post-it notes look at that
like it goes perfectly the purple the
pink it's just it's all there but
they're like twisted honestly I don't
know if they stay that way you can let
me know post-it notes are good to have
try yourself reminders or other stuff so
the next thing I'm literally pulling out
right of things are these eraser caps
for certain neon that's just even cooler
everyone makes mistakes you know so then
the next thing to go with the erasers
are these pencils that they're black
because I was thinking like everyone is
going to have those basic yellow pencils
but you'll be the cool person up with
black pencils how black water is
supposedly cooler like black pencils
right maybe I don't know I thought they
looked cool I would use them and they
look cool too the black with the neon
I'm excited for you guys
I got you purple glow sticks because
normal glow sticks are boring and it
matches with the colored theme it's
perfect
there's four of them so you can glue all
the stuff you need a glue
there's even instructions on the back
bake got you so then the next thing
which I'm obsessed with I actually got
one for myself so we can be twinning is
this planar because I feel like a planer
is such a necessity to have rainbow
marble lish watercolor like I don't even
know I think it's so cute and the inside
is even cute too I always suggest to
have a planner for back-to-school for
life even I use it in the summer the
next thing is a ruler I didn't break it
so this you can like clip into your
binder with the
it matches the whole theme that I was
going for and it's also a ruler so it's
a two-in-one oh and it has a cute little
case but I'm gonna put it back this is
also another thing what's like when
you're waiting in line to hold punch
things in the class you'll be balling
with your own no skip but no slip no
skip no skip it guaranteed ten oh when
you write like it won't like skip I
guess but they're ballpoint pens or just
ten black ones in case you're not a
pencil person and you're a pen person I
went through a time where I only used
pens I got you both just in case the
next thing are these colored pencils I
actually used pencils a lot for like
group projects and things like that so
hopefully these will come in use a
protractor I just got you clear one
because I thought I was going pretty
bright with a lot of the other things so
I thought I would keep it basic for this
one so then these I know growing up if
you had these pencils you were like me
cool one so I had to get these I
honestly feel cool whenever I use them
hopefully you can do but it comes with
also a bonus pen I got you these
highlighters and the only reason I got
these ones specifically is because
there's a purple one and I feel like
Purple's really left out of highlighters
purple is one of my favorite colors and
food highlighters to use so I couldn't
leave it out there 100% total recycled
plastic that is cool we're saving the
world one step at a time
with your highlighters I got you more
pens because I don't I don't know
there's a fine one I'm a fan of these
because I love like small pens and small
lines that sounds really weird like this
video if you agree or comment down below
I got you more pencils and extra strong
mechanical pencils break resistant LEDs
ooh so then I got you note cards these
are good for so many things so I got you
100 of these white I kept it basic I got
you a doughnut full paper clips so you
can make paperclip daisy chains when
you're born in class no I'm just kidding
so the last thing is definitely not the
most exciting thing but you know we all
need it it's a two hole sharpener and
these will go great when you need to
sharpen your cool black pencils that I
got you I'm looking at all these school
supplies right now and I'm
realizing I might have gotten too much
you know it's okay that is everything is
that one of you guys are going to be
winning there's a lot of fun shopping I
