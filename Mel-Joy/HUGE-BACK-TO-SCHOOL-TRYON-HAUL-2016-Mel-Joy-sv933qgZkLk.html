cool huh
peace look stop it oh hey guys it's me
Mel and today's video is going to be a
back-to-school clothing home I remember
my clothing haul from last year and it
just it brings back memories this is a
pretty collective home if you watch my
snapchats which if you don't you can add
me rat hair I you know kind of said that
I had a shopping Pro but this is like
the perfect time to revamp your closet
and everything like that because we're
going back to school why not start the
school year with a new wardrobe right
and if you're new to my channel hey I'm
Mel it's great to meet you I would love
it if you subscribe to my channel it
makes my heart super happy you guys are
crazy we're at 600,000 I don't even know
to say you know where the button is I
have faith in you if you guys are new to
my channel then you don't know that I
say my sizes and prices but instead of
saying it in this video because it takes
so much time I'm just going to put it
right here at the bottom so if you're
wondering what the price or the size is
just look right here so without further
ado I think we should just get straight
on into the video so I tend to start off
my halls with shoes so why not keep that
going the first pair of shoes that I'm
going to show you guys I am obsessed
with them they're these vans but they
are red suede they're like the skater
ones you know you've got me I've been
wanting red shoes for a really long time
like red suede shoes or just even red
shoes and I saw these and I was like wow
I have like two high tops so these are
my first pair of low tops I'm into them
and then the second pair of shoes I'm
also obsessed with them I've been eyeing
these for so long but I've never decided
to actually follow through and get them
I don't know what it was I was keeping
me from buying them I think it was just
the fact that I was scared I couldn't
pull them off or I would have nothing to
wear them with my style is kind of like
evolved over however long so I feel like
I can now wear them and I think store
them with um but they are the Nike
high-top airmax in him oh my gosh I just
I love them guys just can we take a
moment I think they're beautiful they're
super comfortable super supportive and I
don't have like all white shoes
so I was really happy about these
because I've been wanting all my shoes
for really long time and obsessed I'm
gonna start with Urban Outfitters yeah
yeah there aren't that many things but I
just returned some things from Urban
Outfitters so when I went I was like
might as well just look around and see
if I like anything first thing is this
bra let you guys know I'm obsessed with
bralette I have to money please cut me
off of buying broads I have so many bro
let's is just this gray one and like I
said in my last haul and you bitty titty
committee I'm embracing it it's small
but ya know it's just gray it's not
padded it's so comfortable it's just
like cotton perfect just to wear under a
loose tea or anything and this was on
sale so it was really cheap which is a
great deal for Urban Outfitters and then
the second Perla I got and my last haul
I said that I like bought the one the
loved one that goes up here I was gonna
go return it for small but then I saw
this sounds like you know what I like to
swim better still like to say Moroni
wine color which I'm obsessed with and
then I also got this choker which I was
debating whether or not to get it cuz I
was like can I even pull this off like I
don't know but I ended up getting it no
I like it I think it's really like she
would look cute with just like I'm
playing
t-shirt and some jeans I don't know
we'll see and then the last thing I got
I'm actually wearing right now I've been
looking for a camo t-shirt for so long
so when I saw this I like grabbed it I
tried it on and I loved it so of course
I got it but it's just kind of like
faded it's super like casual looking but
I'm obsessed with it it's so comfortable
I've been wearing it like crazy so then
the next place will do is brandy
Melville because I have been racking up
stuff from there every time I would go
to brandy Melville or Paxton Elvis buy a
couple things but it ended up building
up so now we have a pretty good
collection the first two shorts that I
got a while ago Python just show them
are these plane like kind of mom style
shorts I guess I just super high rise
super just like casual basic shorts but
I don't have anything like this so super
excited to my hands on these two then
the second pair looks like this these
are distressed also hi-rise not like
acid-wash but kind of acid wash they
have like different tones of denim but I
think they look really cute perfect was
just like a graphic tee ya know I went
my VidCon if something was carnies so
the next row shorts that I got super
recently they are adorable
I'm Chinese more vocabulary words when I
described
close because I seem to use cute a lot
so they're adorable you guys have
probably seen on Twitter how do you know
how to describe them they're like velvet
right yeah but the ones that I've seen
on Twitter like the pink ones but I
didn't even know that they had this
color so when I went into the store they
didn't have the pink ones but I would
have wanted these anyway just cuz I love
purple and blue and silver and it's just
like all these different tones I look so
cool they're so comfortable oh my
goodness they look so cool on everyone
that I see me and these are like oh my
goodness like what are your shorts I'm
just like they're cool huh but yeah so I
got these and that was this them I say
obsessed too much too so then the next
thing I got at brandy Melville is just
this basic loose like v-neck it's so
soft so lightweight super thin but it
looks super cute just like Rolla and
leggings or jeans super casual I love
shirts like this such like a necessity
to have and then I also got this tank
top it's like this kinda emerald green
teal faded tank top but I don't have a
lot of tank top surprisingly which is
funny because we're in summer and we're
going back to school and a bike egg
drops I don't know I like the color I
thought was really cute just like a nice
thing to be able to just like throw on
the next tank top I got was this black
one I don't have any black like cropped
tank top surprisingly like like low
scoop I've like high neck wands and
things like that but I have nothing like
this so I definitely thought that this
was just like a basic that I should have
so then this one is also I feel like
such a staple they're really just like a
white tank top but it looks super cute
like tied or with a bralette it's kind
of like loose fitted not like super skin
tight but I don't know I really like it
it's just a necessity you know so that's
was everything I got a friendiy mobile
so the last thing I packed Sun was this
choker stick I kind of wore it yesterday
it's kind of hard to show you guys
you'll see it when it's on me but I love
about packs tons chokers is when it
comes in a set they're not attached so
this came with pretty much three chokers
to Golden Beach chokers and then this
one with just a black suede choker with
this really pretty stone and I think so
so nice on the last token from PacSun I
can't find it I don't know I literally
just had it pretty much like a velvet
choker like a long one but you wrap
around twice and then ties in the front
I didn't have anything like this and I
thought it looked really cute so it's
like you know
I'll try it out and I was 50% off so it
was good and then I ordered some stuff
online at forever 21 so the first thing
I got is this t-shirt it's Led Zeppelin
it has white riding with like blue and
like outlines like a glow it looks
really cool but I love this part of it
the like V in the front and then the
sleeves the model on the forever21
website she's wearing like a ton of like
stacked necklaces and it looks so cool
and I was like I want to do that I've
been obsessed with graphic t-shirts and
t-shirts if you guys have been watching
my hauls it's bad but they're like my
favorite thing so then this was sort of
jumping out of my comfort zone do people
say jumping on my company I don't think
people did whatever I said it like nudie
beige a dress but it's like a sweat like
a I don't know how to describe this it
has no sleeves it has a ties a hood and
it's really just like kind of like
bodycon dress but I saw it and I was
like you know what I would look key with
my hi-tops
I don't know I liked it and I was like
you know what Mel new school year is for
trying new things I am trying to expand
my wardrobe my style has changed but I
kind of really like this so that's why I
got it
so then the next thing I don't know if
I'm gonna keep cuz when I tried it on it
was kind of like awkward fitting I don't
know but it's a body suit and it's just
like an army green color I love the
color on your green definitely one of my
faves it doesn't have straps it's like
strapless it's just like line what is
that called
that's not the word ribbed that's the
word it's ripped and I thought was
really cute online and I saw it and I
was like you know what I don't have any
bodysuit so might as well try one out so
then the next thing from forever 21
which I'm obsessed with and this was
such a big deal guys it's this leather
jacket and you would think leather
jackets are like super expensive but
this one really wasn't it's just a black
on there jacket with silver detailing it
also comes with a detachable hood which
I love so you can make it look kind of
casual or you can make it dressed up if
you take the hood off but I really like
it the insides like nice too just a good
jacket I don't have any black on the
jackets so I definitely thought this was
a staple for fall so then the last thing
I got it first fitting one which I got a
really long time ago but I thought I'm
still showing is this tank top but it
has the tie up in the front it's kind of
awkward fitting at the bottom so I think
I just like tuck it into things or maybe
just wear it with like jeans or whatever
doing the last things I got a four and
one
the choker and like a choker slash
necklace this one is just a velvet
choker with the gold chain but what I
don't get about this one is that the
chain is shorter than the choker
so the choker is loose and the chain is
tight I thought it was supposed to be
the other way around I mean it's still
cute I have to figure out kind of how to
wear it because when I've been trying to
wear it like it looks really weird and
like the chokers loose but the chains
not you know we'll see and then this
last piece of jewelry actually might end
up returning tell me your guys opinions
on it because I thought it was just like
one of these really long chokers that
you like tie in the front but I didn't
realize it had like hammered metal I
bamberg metal goes here as a choker and
then also at the bottom so let me know
what you guys think of this not only
know if I dig it or not we'll see so
then I ordered some stuff from obey I
was wearing a no base sweatshirt in one
of my last videos you guys seemed to
really like it I've loved obey ever
since I was in like a middle school so
the first thing I got was this t-shirt
it is a men's t-shirt I got two men's
items because I liked their stuff better
was cuter it's just this pink t-shirt I
thought it had an O on it online instead
it did but it says obey which is still
cute I'm fine with it and then on the
back it just says obey with the flower a
rose it is a guy shirt so it's kind of
big on me I love just wearing like
oversized t-shirts and tying it or even
wearing it loose and yeah I just really
like the color and I love t-shirts
t-shirts are my favorite you guys know
that so then the next thing I'm obsessed
with it has like this red riding on I
think looks so dope it says Bad Brains
so they teamed up with Bad Brains the
band to like make march on obey its
oversized on me because it's a guy
sweatshirt I could literally live in
just an oversized sweatshirt it's so
soft and comfortable so is the t-shirt
actually and then the next sweatshirt I
got is from Thrasher you guys have
probably seen this all over my snapchat
on my Instagram but I've been obsessed
with this thing it's camo like my shirt
but I actually got this off eBay
whatever it's good but only place I
could find it but I really wanted this
sweatshirt
it says Thrasher it came with the
Thrasher tag it has a thresher tag on it
so let's hope it's Thrasher a little
brass detailing and then on the back it
has the other Thrasher sign it's really
soft and I'm just obsessed and then the
last place I went to was zoomies
the first t-shirt is also from Thrasher
I got this while ago you guys saw it in
my vegan taste test but it's just this
black t-shirt that says Thrasher on it
fiery letters I love it it's just
I see in a small I might try
getting the like kids boys t-shirt and
like a large or a medium because this is
pretty big but once again just tying it
or like oversized t-shirt but super cute
but is this super big oversized t-shirt
it says death wish on it that's a little
you know a little scary but I just
thought it was too cute I loved the
tie-dye
and the colors together I liked it the
writing on it I don't know it's pretty
much a t-shirt dress on me or I could
like wear it with leggings or whatever I
thought this would look really cute was
just like sneakers like my high tops so
soft to even asleep and this would be
amazing so that was everything I got in
