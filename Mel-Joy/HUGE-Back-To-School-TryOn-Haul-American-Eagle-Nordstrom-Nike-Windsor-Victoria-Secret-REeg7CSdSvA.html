today I'm going to be doing a
back-to-school clothing haul let's just
take a moment of silence for summer 2k15
you were good to us just don't want to
go nope don't know I start school very
soon too soon by the time you see this
video I will probably be in school to
you or back to school I decided to go
shopping because I do almost every year
if you guys were on my channel one year
ago I posted a video a back to school
haul you can check that out the link is
in the downbar the transformation is
real it's kind of weird I've been on
YouTube for year but yeah so today I'm
just going to be hauling for you guys I
went to a couple different places I
honestly don't know if I'm gonna go
shopping after I've done this video and
have more stuff but hopefully not
because I don't think my wallet can
afford that quick disclaimer I'm not
doing this video to brag in any way
shape or form a lot of you guys seem to
like my hauls and back to school halls
even more exciting / sad let's get
started
the first place I went to was American
Eagle and this bag is too big I really
like American Eagle jeans so that is the
reason I went I was like I'm gonna go
for jeans I'm gonna get some jeans and
then like it'll be all good I go in
there I'm just like okay everything so
cute like this is a problem I ended up
trying on a ton of stuff we ended up
with that so I just you know let's just
let's just start with jeans because that
was something that I have almost none of
right now because since I started
working out more since last year none of
my jeans fit me anymore just like okay
like great so I got four pairs of jeans
they were a buy one get one half off Shh
dude chill might as well you know the
first pair I got are these plain like
dem jeans they're just really light wash
I don't have any jeans like just like
this with no you know rips or paint or
anything on them and I've been always
wanting a pair like this so ever you
need to Drake to finally get them I
really like the way they look the butt
just looks like this they're super
comfortable they're just the skinny
style I think yeah and I'm gonna tell
you my size I know a lot of you don't
like when I tell you my size but a lot
of people do if you don't hear myself
ugh your ears I got them in a size zero
my size and genes like totally is
different in each brand but these were
39.95 so I bought one pair and I got the
next pair half off and they are like
denim also I really like like different
jeans but they are distressed and they
have holes in the knees and some
distressing up here by the pocket and I
really like the holes in the knees I
think they look really cute I've never
had jeans I have like two holes in the
knees and they make them a lot more
comfortable which is funny and then
they're not as skinny as this pair on
the bottoms I really like the way they
look and they just look like this the
butt looks like that so I got these also
same size they are the skinny glacier
crush low-rise cool cool
also those skinny jeans but they say
super stretch on them but they're not
like super jegging but they're you know
they're very comfortable I just got them
in a regular - I used to be short and
jeans and I'm regular I drew gummy this
is like lycra dual effect super silly
this is some intense fabric going on
here
cool a separate tab for for these are
usually for 995 I need jeans so I
invested in jeans because I really like
them and jeans that fit well and good
quality jeans like American Eagle they
will last a long time so then the next
pair of jeans are the same style as the
first pair of light denim ones but
they're just darker denim I like barely
ever own jeans this shade but I really
liked them on I usually have like the
light ones or like super dark ones but
this is like in-between so it's cool to
get jeans that I haven't really had
before same size but these are on
jegging yeah these are judging skinny
still but they're not like a jegging
that's like leggings there's still Jean
material they're just structured no the
first pair isn't jeggings but this is
sugar and this is they're all low-rise
the very cute the butt looks like this I
really like them I've owned barely
anything like these so I'm excited to
wear these then the last pair I was not
even planning on getting we were just
gonna get these three and my mom's like
well might as well like buy another pair
for 50% off like if you find a pair you
like then you should that's like looking
to a store and it just likes all these
and I was like oh my god
and I was like I'm trying so I got them
but I really like them I don't own
anything like them and they are the Thom
girl sits low on hip regular standard
they're in double zero so these are
boyfriend jeans I'm pretty sure the
boyfriend jeans I like them to be a
little tighter fit cuz the other the
bigger pair were like super loose and my
hips legs but these were like a little
tighter and I liked that look better and
they just look like this or like a dark
wash and they're distressed and they
have little cuffs at the bottom I'm not
super crazy about the backside because
they kind of look like not tie-dyed but
like not acid wash Oh splotchy and then
has the like things but I really like
these so I got these for 50% off I
believe and they were usually 4995 so
these were the four pairs of jeans that
I got that I have been eating for a very
long time so hungry have you got those
the next thing at American Eagle we got
some clothes up in here the first thing
is this tank top it is this nudey pink
low-cut tank top just got an extra small
it's the soft and sexy a eeo tank and it
just looks like this and it's really
comfortable and I think it would look
cute with a bra let you know because
it's low-cut one of them was buy one get
one half off was this one was 2495 I
don't know I got this shirt also stuff
in sexy tee and it is this really like
pink color almost nude pretty nude and
it just has a pocket and it's so soft
and comfortable and I'd like tried tying
it with the jeans and I look so cute and
this was 1995 I think this was buy one
get one half off two of my things about
going half off so that I got half off
this tank top and it is just this white
plain loose tank top and this is gonna
look cute with like anything like a bra
lap jeans shorts it's just a good staple
to have like a thicker strap one and I
got the cinnamon extra small as well I
can't find the price tag where you at
over here this was 90 95 also but I
think this was by would going half off
and it's really cute and comfortable and
yeah so then the next thing I got was
this cardigan and now we're getting into
more the fall stuff whose follows you
know kind of act
you feel I'm hungry I got this maroon
cardigan and it's so cute I love it it
has these black buttons on it and these
pockets and I was deciding whether to
get the maroon one or it's like this
white one with black speckles but I have
a black one with white speckles from for
everyone and I just pictured myself
wearing this morning I was like you know
what I just should get this I really
like it a lot and it's oversized and
maroon and so comfortable and this looks
look like this and this was 39 but a lot
of this stuff was on sale not sure if
that was on sale any thirsty and I got
the cardigan in an extra small so then
the next thing I got with these leggings
and I don't know really when I'm gonna
wear these maybe was like the white top
and the jean jacket or something they're
just maroon leggings there's an extra
small high-rise leggings and I wasn't
actually gonna get these but then I
looked at the price and it was usually
like 15 on sell for 11 and then 50% off
so they're like five and I was like you
know what why not like I can always just
set the point as like as pajamas or just
to hang out like there so she even if I
end up finding a cute way to wear them
like I will have them and I really like
maroon I got these I love this sweater
oh my god just something about it so it
is the don't ask why this is kind of the
brandy melville for American Eagle
because it's one size and this was
usually 5495 and it was long so if like
20 and I was like okay you're mine and
it is just this oversized knit sweater
is so so comfortable it's kind of
see-through
dude we're like you know a bralette with
it or something and it's just this
oatmeal like pinky color I don't know
anything like this and it's so cute and
comfortable I just really liked the way
it looked and I like this with leggings
and boots for the fall just just then
the next thing I got at American Eagle
well technically it's Airy but it's an
American Eagle is this bralette and it
is this gray bralette I really like
bright lights when I don't own any gray
Rolex and I thought this would look
really cute with you know lower cut
stuff and I got a medium it gives a
small or too small this fits really well
and I like it a lot it's really
comfortable and cute and soft and I like
colored and excited to wear this and
this was I believe 1995 which is not bad
for berola at all the last thing I got
in American Eagle is this maroon jacket
I feel bad getting so much marine stuff
just cuz I feel like I
or too much maroon I just really enjoyed
the color I didn't I feel like we're
gonna get old and be wearing it but you
know I like the stuff so that's what
matters but it is this zip up jacket and
you can never have enough zip up jacket
that's like my logic I love zip up
jackets you can just throw them on over
anything and just wear them out and run
them at home and they're very
comfortable and I don't have any this
thick I have some thin ones but this is
like a nice thick jacket and the inside
is so so soft it is so comfortable and
that has these little white like brass
or bronze detailing very cute I can see
myself wearing a salon fall and winter
and I'm just very excited to wear this
and I just got a small that is all I got
at American Eagle I ended up saving I
think it was $150 members this month get
20% off their whole purchase and then
like almost everything was on sale and I
was like wow this is beautiful
the next place I went to I got some vans
so all of my vans are disgustingly old I
have one pair from two years ago and one
pair from last year I just washed them
to like okay they're just like the white
basic ones I don't have like a lot of
sneaker a casual shoes that I could wear
so I was like you know what let's just
buy a new pair for back to school and I
had my eyes on these for a very long
time but the low top kind I had got the
high top high but I had my eyes on the
low top time for such a long time I
tried them on and I really liked them
I'll show them to you now they are these
grey high tops with the little why I
think they're so cute like come on come
on I don't know I really like them
they're this light grey color and then
have the little like padding up here and
a white stripe if you're wondering my
shoe size I'm a seven and a half on fact
I run any high tops I don't own any like
light grey you know fan type thing or
with the stripe so you know what I'm
happy I invested in you think they were
like seventy sixty I'm not sure shoes
can last me a long time the next place I
went lady Foot Locker so from Nike I got
some shoes so I do some sports you guys
probably know that if you've watched my
other videos and I like to exercise on
my own my riding shoes are so old and so
unsupportive now they just like totally
worn out and the lady at the store told
me you
only have running shoes for like six
months and I've had those for like over
a year and I'm like who should probably
get anyone so I decided to get some new
sneakers I was debating getting like
colorful ones or you know black or white
ones I've had colorful ones for like the
last couple years of my life and I was
like you know let's try something a
little less colorful and I can wear with
more stuff so the shoes that I got are
these black Nikes and they have white
detailing and I think they're super cute
they are the lunar tempo
I tried off a ton of different types but
I really like these wrong and they just
have this really cool detailing on them
like some little holes no I just really
like them and I feel like I would also
not just ready to work out but like wear
them to hang out there Drago and I was
debating getting white or black but I
decided that black will get dirty a lot
less easier so I decided to get these
and these were $100 because they're
running shoes but right like you got it
invest in those feet
you know those feet you gotta take good
care of them also from Nike at lady Foot
Locker I got these shorts and I have
been eyeing these shorts for the longest
time but they didn't have them at my
stuff in my size at my sports store so I
was like dang it this short fitting
would I have a couple of small and a
couple of extra small I really like
these they are just this really pretty
lavender color with this mint side and
kind of like hot pink lining with the
white is it silver
it's over this silver Nike and you fold
over the band looks like that and a
little string is pink I don't know I
really I wear running shorts a lot for
exercising and chilling in and I just
needed a new pair so I picked these out
and it was buy one get one half off a
panel so I picked up this sports bra
with it and it's kind of the same color
that's funny but it's a slight purple
color and it says Nike on I have none
other sports bras that say Nike I just
have the ones with the swishes and
though I really like it and I really
like the color and the black band and I
got to change mode I believe this was 40
I didn't tell you these these were 30
but it's buy one get one half off so I
saved some moolah and I was in need of
both of these things so then the last
thing from Nike were these sweatpants
and I've been wanting these sweatpants
for so long a lot of my snow pants now
were just old and like used like really
badly used like falling apart so I
thought
about time to get a new pair of pants so
I got these Nike ones you've probably
seen them around but they're just flat
they say Nike on the side he fold this
over and it says just do it on it quite
cute and I really wanted black
sweatpants
they all said gray but my black
sweatpants are so old from a very secret
they're like grey now and they just have
some silver detailing and these were 55
I got them an extra small and they're
super cute I'm very excited through
these and they have some pockets which
is always helpful I love sweat pants
with pockets so then the next place I'd
like to was Victoria's Secret and um I
uh I got some bras I don't think I
should show you just to keep it pg-13
the reason I got bras is I went up a cup
size I don't know if that's TMI but so I
got some new bras that are my actual
size I got four bras I got a new one I
got a maroon one I got a strapless nude
one because I have no shadow strength in
that black wood I'm not gonna go into
much depth about them or anything like
that so then I went to North gym and I
have not shopped at Nordstrom's a lot I
was like discussing this with my mom and
we were like should we invest in some
like some nicer clothes or like a bit of
a higher price but that will like but
will last me longer nor she was actually
having a sale to the first thing I got
at Nordstrom was this super super cute
pop and it is just this oatmeal color
I don't close is it a waffle top like a
Henley top is six buttons and then the
sleeves are just like cuffed like this
and it is so cute and so I cannot wait
to wear this in an extra-small I was 38
which is in a little pricey for a shirt
like this but I think I'm going to get a
lot of use out of it so then the next
thing I got was this white crop top and
then the same exact style this is like a
mauve mauve dark nude color I don't know
I really like this actually on and
they're really high cut I just got them
both in small they're usually 16 but on
sale for 960 so I got two on sale these
I think I'm gonna wear a lot and they're
very cute and the last piece of clothing
I got it choice um was this grey Henley
top I believe I don't know it has three
buttons and it is just gray and really
thin and like oversized and I tried it
on and I like tied it and I looked
really cute this is a big neckline you
can wear like a bra that with it I think
it's gonna look very cute and this was
24 then the last thing I got at
Nordstrom I'm
the other earrings and I got these I
think they're so cute they're two moon
two stars two little diamonds with two
triangles which are probably my favorite
and two little circles and I really like
these and they were 14 for six pairs of
earrings like $14 is not bad at all and
I really think they're cute and I'm
gonna put them in soon than the last
store I'm going to show you what I got
from is Windsor and they were kind
enough to send me some stuff Windsor is
so cute if you haven't seen the website
go check it out down below it is so cute
so they sent me some stuff for the
back-to-school season I really like
everything the first thing that they 70
was this this white thin tank top and it
spaghetti straps and it's so cute and
this looks really cute with a bra let I
actually wore this on my birthday I just
got it in an extra-small and it's super
affordable and cute the next thing I've
got was this flannel and this is going
to keep me warm during the winter and
fulltime blue and white checkered flame
and it's super super soft just buttons
down the middle so you can button it up
or wear it open tank top I wore these
together actually um but I think it
looks super cute I really like flannels
for the fall and winter time and then
this is probably one of my favorite
things that I received but it is this
tunic dress and I got a size extra small
and it is this charcoal color fabric is
ribbed puffed on the sleeves and this is
so easy just to throw along it's like a
belt for necklace I just like run out
the door and it's so so comfortable it
is so cute and I own nothing like this
and I've always wanted a teen but that
next thing they sent me was this super
cute necklace and I really really like
it I've always wanted something like
this but this is a cheaper alternative
to them like the super expensive ones
gold circle necklace and I think it
looks super cute and it's just a little
dainty necklace I can with a lot of
staff their jewelry is so affordable and
good quality so I really like that and
then I got this bralette I just got it
in a small and this can looks like the
Urban Outfitters one our Free People one
and it just looks like that in the back
it's racerback and it's super cute this
is only eighteen ninety which is pretty
affordable for all that this is probably
also one of my favorite things that I
received it is this army jacket is this
green army jacket but it's a little bit
like fancier and you know nicer fabric
and this I just look like this they're
cuffed it has some pockets here I really
dig it
I liked it a lot it has some brass
detailing on it around the whole jacket
and zipper and buttons and I don't
really own anything like this so I'm
really excited for this I just got it in
a spa and then I got this super cute
skirt and it's hard to show on camera it
is like this maroon burgundy color and
it's super cute and it's like a pencil
skirt and I think I can wear this like
fancier occasions so yeah thank you so
