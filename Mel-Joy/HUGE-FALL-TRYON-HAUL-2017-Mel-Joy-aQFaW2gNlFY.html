today's video is going to be a whole I
know I recently did one but that was
like collective and this is everything I
have been buying recently because for
some reason spending my money on clothes
is what makes me super happy so yeah
here's another haul and if you're new to
my channel what is up it is great to
meet you I hope you're doing awesome
I have faith you know the subscribe
button is and the notification button
and also if you're new to my channel and
you haven't seen one of my hauls before
I like to see the prices and the sizing
honestly like that's what helped me the
most about hauls if I wanted something
the price and the size is right there if
the girl was similar to my size or if
the price was like in my price range you
know and of course I will have
everything linked down below for you
guys if you want to go check out the
products buy them look at them whatever
your heart desires okay let's get
started into the video I think we should
start with Urban Outfitters because
that's where I did the most damage if
you know me you know Urban Outfitters is
where my favorite stores it's killer so
the first thing I got is this army
jacket each one is like unique which i
think is really cool like mine has like
some rips up here and when I asked the
lady I was like is it damaged sure is it
supposed to come like that and she said
all of them are different I don't know I
just really wanted a jacket like this
for so long and I'm really happy about
it I'm really happy about it
so the next jacket is just this plain
black denim jacket I like how it's a
little more crotch than like a usual
denim jacket our usual denim jacket does
that make sense
a typical that attract I don't know I
don't know I really liked it I don't own
any black denim so this is sick to have
it's from bdg I really like their done
this next jacket wait hold up when you
first look at it it's like yellow it's a
big bomber jacket whatever but I mean I
already incepted but you can see that
there's like this red flannel print on
the inside that's like yellow black and
white in it when I first saw it I was
like is this my style like when I wear
it do I like it but then I like really
warmed up to it and I bought it and I
really really liked it it's like very
different I feel like for me but I love
it I don't know it's such a look it's
also super big and super warm so this is
gonna be helpful for the wintertime so
this jacket is also from Urban
Outfitters
it's just this white jacket that says
boom on it it's a booming jacket it has
a red stripe down each sleeve I just
think this is super safe it is
definitely like a sport style jacket
though because of the top since it like
closes up here you know so maybe I'll
wear this working out too but yeah just
got this jacket red and white two of my
favorite colors together just a little
Puma
19:48 on it super cute so this next
hoodie I got from Urban Outfitters has a
lot of stains on it so don't pay
attention to that I haven't washed it I
wore it I got Mexican food and me eating
a burrito in a nice jacket just doesn't
end well but anyways this is just a
champion jacket as you can see a hoodie
we got the hood it just has the champion
signs on it typical you know it's just
like a cream off-white color and the
reason I got this is because the girl
you know I'm trying to do a two-piece
I've been obsessed with two pieces
matching outfits whatever I don't own a
lot of them but I'd like to own more so
I just got these sweatshirts like when I
wear these to like Nike high socks and
vans like just a casual but like cute
and like put together look you feel me
so then I also got these jeans they're
also from BDG they look like this but
what I really like about these is the
bottom but they're super high rise which
are like my favorite type of jeans they
make your butt look great they make your
waist look great
I just I love them so the next thing
I'll do from Urban is just this bodysuit
oh I know I just think this is like a
perfect basic why not so yeah honestly
this piece right here has probably been
my most worn piece out of all this stuff
so I loved beanies for like a really
long time but I never like I don't know
I just didn't really wear them I don't
really know how to style them and all
that stuff I'm back to beanies it's just
we're back it's a face it's happening
again you'll probably see me in a lot of
beanies and I'm probably gonna order
like all of these at all the colors for
this I just fold it up like this put it
on my head we get to go your hair is
fixed you don't have to deal with your
hair I just everyone needs a beating in
their life that's what I think and of
course I just got it in orange because
orange is one of my favorite favorite
colors from Urban I also just got these
glasses I have these in red
and I wear them so so much there are my
friends favorite glasses everyone watch
them they make the world look way cooler
than it is the sky is pink when you wear
them like yeah these the world doesn't
look as cool but I mean if I have the
red why not get the yellow because you
can't be yellow I just spent like five
minutes trying to find this next t-shirt
I'm back and I got the Jake shirt look
at that just a black shirt that's it's
Drake on it and orange if that's not me
and a shirt I really just I don't know
what is black and orange and then my boo
Drake so the last thing I got it urban
are just these fishnet red tights
they're little all over the place right
now I don't know I haven't warnings yet
but like this under jeans you know with
like rips and stuff will be it look
really quickly I'm gonna show some stuff
I got from PacSun a while ago but when I
tried to find the links online they
weren't there so I'll have similar links
down below but I'm sorry I couldn't find
a pencil the first thing I just got from
PacSun a minute ago were these pants
pants like this or my life like I love
cute comfortable pants that I can make a
look you know like that's why most of
these fans like I deliver like one pair
jeans so they're just ride with of
course the adidas stripes then they say
adidas on the back and then they have
these zippers in the back which i think
is actually really cool they get tighter
make it looser so you can like wear them
as like capris or long pants or whatever
you want
so the next thing from PacSun I got from
the guy section what's new honestly like
most of the time I'll just be in the guy
section because they got cute clothes
I'm gonna be honest so it's just this
kappa jacket it is black and then it has
gold detailing oh no I really like it
I've already wearing this a lot it's
still fresh it's still clean so moving
on to a different story that is all I
got from PacSun I'll really quickly go
through what I got from I am gia this
store is fire so the first thing I got
are some sweatpants they're just orange
with a black stripe down each leg and
then at the bottom here
they say IM gia in Old English font I
believe this is what I use for my March
to or similar stuff to this and then I
just got the matching cropped sweatshirt
to go with it and then on the back here
it says gia and I also got this dry
from Ikea this is just so cute first of
all it's camo
second of all it's orange camo it has
stripes on the sleeves
there's green in it which i think is
super dope it's like green orange and
black and white like dark dark green I
don't know the material is super soft
it's like silky I'm really happy with
this and I want to get the pants I need
to talk about these pants for a hot SEC
because they were five dollars it just
look like this navy blue with white
stripes down the sides
I love these like this was like a white
tank top like out the door you look cute
and you're comfortable as hell moving on
to my favorite favorite online shops
vintage stuff like redone stuff you know
they reworked it or whatever I've been
buying their stuff and repping them for
so long but they recently just sent me a
couple pieces which was so sweet of them
thank you I'm cookware lay you to ball
so the first thing they sent me was
dress this shirt that says army on it
and I think it's super cute it has a
zipper that you can zip up and down it's
a working zipper like how cute I've
never seen this before we hold up hold
up I like show you guys perfected this
BAM it says harley-davidson on it I love
probably Davidson so they were so split
on when they sent me this it's like
overalls but on a shirt just like oh my
god I think like the hardware just adds
so much they also sent me this shirt
which is something super different to me
you don't never owned anything like this
but it has like these clips at the
bottom and then it's like a cropped like
plaid shirt but like I think this could
really be a look if you style it the
right way so I'm like really excited to
play around with this and experiment and
then hold up can we just we just take a
moment I've been seeing these like all
over social media and everything like
that a little rose pattern on the vans
but I think it looks super cute
especially with the checkers I'm super
excited about these these are so so so
cute so thank you I'm a kook well that
you guys are to bomb this stuff is so
cute and if you guys want to check out
I'm Coco la they gave me a discount code
for you guys
15% off if you use the code smell joy so
go ham so the next two things are from
oh mighty calm this is a funny story I
tried to return them but they got sent
back to me and I think it was like a
sign because when I tried them back on I
was like why did I want to return these
this is so cute I don't really know but
maybe everything happens very
in life I'm still trying to figure that
out - just black silk pants that have
ruching on the bottom so they're like
fitted you know you feel me and then
they're just orange stripes on the side
I think they're so sick so cute I also
got the same ones in gold when I saw
these on the website
I imagined like right away and all white
outfit with these bands like come on
they're just so shiny and like pretty to
look at
anyways I think that concludes this haul
