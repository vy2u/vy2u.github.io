Bell button if you want to be notified
every time I post a video my voice is
killing me right now but it's cool it's
good before I lose my voice let's get
started on to this video
so I think I want to start with
accessories from princess Polly because
I'm really happy with them and I'm
excited about them you guys know how
obsessed I am with colored sunglasses or
any type of cool sunglasses or not
sunglasses just glasses in general and
oh my god I got a snapchat when I saw
these I could not resist myself because
like come on if these aren't a vibe I
don't I don't know what is they're
pretty much these clear glasses and
they're like kind of cat eye shaped oh
my god
does it look good with my fin and then
red inside which is just like my
favorite part like so Joe I don't know
these are such a vibe I just I love I
love any type of solar solar cutting I
love me some colored Sun Gus I can't
talk that was the first thing I got and
then moving onto some jewelry a loose
look in the bag okay these are such a
vibe so the first I can't even like do
noises like that because my sick boys
I'm so mad the first earrings I got
looked like this oh hey stomach I don't
know how to describe them but they just
kind of look like crosses but also like
bullets and then like a circular thing I
don't know but their vibe and I really
like them they're just really like
chunky and one just fell off but like
this with the dark outfit is just like
such a vibe they're just cool I feel
like I say vibe now to describe things
instead of cute because that's my the
other word and then I have two other
pairs of earrings as well little crosses
on little mini hoops almost and I think
oh and I just gold like they're really
good quality and they look really nice I
want to start wearing more like chunky
statement earrings statement earrings
yeah there we go and then the last pair
kind of looks similar to the second pair
actually but they're like bigger hoops
here with a little mini cross right here
and are these I think these are rose
gold which is cool because I don't own a
lot of rose gold earrings but I'm just
really excited about this and I know a
lot of them are like cross looking like
but I like earrings like that cool the
next accessory is just this purse and
it's just red and that's like gold
detailing on it and I think it's super
cute I like the size of it a little
bigger than my hand this is just the
strap put it over the shoulder like so
or however you want to wear it I don't
know it's cute and I want to get
more purses because I think purses add a
lot to an outfit too I'm one to use like
one or two purses and like be content
but I want to expand my collection
the next accessory is just this belt I'm
in such need of belt I feel like I just
need accessories even staple accessories
like about or earrings and things like
that like I don't know I just I want to
expand but this one's really cool
because it just has two little silver
circles and then it's just black
so like basic good and I'm excited to
wear belts so I think that's it for the
accessories and let's move on to clothes
I'm excited let's do this so this first
thing is just this jacket you can tell
this is like a nice quality jacket I
love really washed out right now just
says like almost dark silver like
gunmetal detailing which I really like
and it's just like a bad ass look like
come on like I'm excited to wear this in
the fall and you know trying to style it
was a lot of things I know it's fall
time and going into the winter time and
things like that and summer is over
sadly I still felt the need to get some
tank tops because I think tank tops are
really good staples to like layer pieces
if that makes sense I got this crop top
and it's just like a orange like burnt
orange crop top with like a really thin
strap which I really like it's like
circular like elastic you know this is
not appropriate to wear in the winter
time because I'll freeze my ass off this
won't look like jackets and things like
that you know but I got this one
firstly and it's just like so adorable
like come on I just I love this color
and I want more like colored crop tops
because I'm just really into neutrals I
feel like I have mostly like neutral
closet right now and I'm getting more
into light colors as you can tell so ya
know you got it start somewhere and then
I just have this black tank top it's
kind of the exact same style it is the
exact same style but it's just black
because I still like neutrals and then I
got this shirt and can we talk about
this for a sec it's just black with red
dragons along the Cheetos
I don't know it's super like good
quality like it's thick and I can
tell that it's gonna last a long time
and I just think this is super badass
and like super my style and I'm so
excited to wear it I was gonna get this
in white but they didn't have it so this
is just like a gray ribbed crop top I
feel like this is perfect just for like
trying to look cute but trying to feel
chill and you know I'm always in the
basics honestly I always feel like I can
have more basics it's just good with
everything and then I just got this
shirt and this is so cute it's a little
more like girly for me I don't know it's
just very like a very booby shirt I'm
usually not any stuff like that but I
kind of wanted to give it a shot like if
I wore with like a lace bra let I think
it'd be really cute and when you tie it
like you know covers more than what you
see here it's just a really pretty like
khaki green army green color but I like
it and I feel like it brings out my eyes
I'm trying to try out different styles
so you know why not and then I just got
oh my god I look so washed out I'm gonna
look like a ghost then I got a similar
style shirt but it's black and it's like
silk like it's nice quality and it's
almost like a button-up you know what I
mean like looks like a nicer style shirt
it out the collar and everything like
that it's still cropped and still ties
up but I feel like it's like super
elegant like classy I'll see how I could
wear this but I'm excited to you know
branch out try every style in the book
because what else is life for I also got
I broke my finger but I got what's up I
got three pairs of jeans from there and
I'm obsessed with them like I'm actually
obsessed with them I've been looking for
like vintage you know just old school
chill type of jeans for so long and I
haven't really found like the ones I
like best on my body but can we talk
about these for a sec so they're just
kind of like straight like jeans in a
way as you can tell like this in the
back they have a red it's not right on
the butt but it's like right below it
like on the side so pg-13 the color is
perfect the style is perfect I don't
know I'm like super happy with these
jeans and I can already tell I'm gonna
be wearing them so so much I also got
the same ones in black they sell the rip
right here same style with different
colors I'm gonna have fun with these the
last pair of jeans are just these really
big jeans like they're bulky they're
like thick I don't know how to describe
it but they're just big chill distressed
jeans and I'm excited about this like
wear this with bands and just a chill
top and it's like old-school bitstream
jacket I need to talk about is so cute
the back looks like this and it's super
distressed it almost looks like a rib
cage like right I don't know I like it
and then on each of the sleeves by the
elbows it's cut out which i think is
super cool and like I don't know it's
very grunge very distressed I'm into it
I'm a fan so then I got two dresses and
this for me was kind of branching out of
my comfort zone because I don't wear
dresses a lot but I don't know I feel
like dresses are good for certain
occasions and I just felt like I needed
to own more like dresses I could wear
and I'm excited because I really like
these the first one oh my god check this
out look at it come on it's just this
dress and it's like it's like a burnt
orange
it almost looks tangerine on camera but
it's like golden darker I am gonna say
burn orange I think I'm gonna roll with
that it's kind like a straight neck if
I'm saying that right I don't know I
really like it it's just the same like
it doesn't it's good like it's just like
loose and flowy it's not like body con
or tight fit or anything it's cute I'm
excited to wear this and you know just
girly for once this dress is hot like
this dress is oh look look at her oh my
god oh my god oh it's just like a red
ribbed dress but it's so soft the straps
are a little thicker then like a
spaghetti strap but I really like this
size of the straps I just love this I
just really do so yeah I got a dress
it's cool the last thing from princess
Holly I'm really excited about this
because look at this oh my god it's fake
fur don't go crazy we good it's fake
it's just like a silver jacket
super soft you know I'm not gonna be
just like on every day but for like
photo shoots or just like a day where I
want to look super extra and super just
put together you know have a lettuce fit
I have this this I just feel like for
certain occasions I'll be really excited
to have this I might just wear this by
myself honestly in my department I
wanted I would that is everything I got
from princess Polly make sure to check
out their website down below in the
description box and use my code if you
want a discount so I got a couple things
from Urban Outfitters and these are kind
of more like collective pieces of but I
haven't showed you guys and I just I
forget and back to show you so the first
thing is just this red dress and it has
black stripes on it and it's like kind
of turtleneck but not all the way like a
little bit but I got so many questions
on this when I wore it in an Instagram
post and stuff in New York so I thought
I would include it in the hall let you
guys know about it from Urban Outfitters
and it's super comfortable I really like
it it's cute I also got this skirt which
I wore in New York Fashion Week and it's
just this black and white striped skirt
with these orange zippers and I think
it's so dope and super cool it was a
little bit out of my comfort zone when I
bought it but now I'm into it and I
don't know the right outfit like
definitely a look and then I just got
these shorts and they just feel like
working out or if I just want to wear
like a sporty outfit one day they're
just from bro right um bro but the
design on the side is super cool and on
