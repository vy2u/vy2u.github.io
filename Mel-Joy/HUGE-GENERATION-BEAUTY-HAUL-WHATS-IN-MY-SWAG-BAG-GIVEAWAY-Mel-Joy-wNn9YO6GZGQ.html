love LA so much and it was awesome I had
such a fun weekend definitely one of the
best weekend's of my life I went to LA
for a couple main reasons but the main
reason is because I was invited by FC to
go to generation beauty and it was
awesome I had so much fun they gave out
a lot of makeup and I think I'm crooked
but personally I was a beauty creator
which means like you have YouTube and
you're like with the Ipsy Studios OS
whatever they call it
oopsie so anyway I was part of that
group and that group were just like 800
people we're going to the cocktail party
that was on Friday of course I didn't do
any cocktails because I'm 16 but
Michelle Phan was there she was so sweet
all the other beauty creator girls were
there it was a lot of fun and they gave
out something called the FC swag bag and
this thing is crazy
yeah no can't close it
this big bag that says from Ipsy With
Love how cute is that this is all full
of makeup like what and that was just
Friday then I went to it generation dude
on Sunday and Sunday and they are
handing out for makeup the entire
weekend I have this guy Phillips make up

shape or form a lot of you guys have
been asking for me to do this video if
you guys have watched my la vlogs which

tuned to the end and I'll go over all
the rules and I've read even filming for
six minutes
how did that happen let's get started
I'm just gonna start with the Ipsy swag
bag it's pretty heavy like I was getting
a workout carrying it right I was so I
don't even I don't know where to start
what's the first thing I see hmm we're
doing some of this it's makeup forever
the line there was crazy I didn't even
get to go in it I really wanted to get
the Makeup Forever HD foundation but I
didn't but it's so quick but it comes in
this very cute blood drive and then
three eyelashes you got the last show so
they just look like that I like have no
fake eyelashes so I'm very excited for
these I don't think I'll just start
wearing fake eyelashes every once in a
while go out of my comfort zone this is
our day this is more fake eyelashes I'm
not gonna go into everything just
because video will be like 20 minutes
but I got some eyelashes from there like
a whole different variety I think
there's three like natural at a bigger I
got the eyelash glue I got the pomade it
just comes with the angled brush and
spoolie C like that oh and then we got
some individual lashes as well so it's
just like this whole little lash and
eyebrow kits very cute side to try
eyelashes out some of the next thing are
these lucky brushes and I'm so excited
for these so it's really cute it just
says Lexi on the box though and this
line was also crazy but it just came
with four brushes I think this is the
Kabuki set but I'm not sure because if
they had the brushes on sale
I think the first one is this precision
angled contour that proposition tapered
pro precision face and the precision
foundation and I'm definitely going to
be using these they look so nice and
fluffy they're very soft so yeah these
four brushes so except for I love
brushes they're synthetic handmade
brushes so then the next thing I got was
this gray go twenty color Hawk
collection I don't even know what brand
this is from I feel like it's a crown
brush but I'm not sure just because they
were selling pilots a lot of fun colors
this will be fun for some brighter looks
the next thing is this derma e purifying
tuned one charcoal mask
I'm so excited to use this cuz I've
gotten really into like skin care skin
treatment I don't know just things to
make your skin better I'm really excited

skincare and get all of this this is the
proactive step you get step one two
three and then a quick fix blemish pen
