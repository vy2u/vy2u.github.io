setup today different location if you
guys like this location let me know I
did shine I was just out of ideas of
where to film today I'm going to be
doing a haul because I just recently got
back from Florida if you guys were not
watching my photo blogs go check them
out links down below so this one if
outlets in Florida so I went to those
damaged ones done so the first place
that I will haul from is Victoria's
Secret so Victoria's Secret has a lot of
big deals there because it's an outlet
like I just said the first thing I'm
going to be showing from Carrie secret
is this pink zip up Hoodie
it's super light pink and it's super
lightweight too
and then this the ties are like almost
like ribbon actually and it's really
cute it just has some wings right here
on the sleeve and this was usually I
think 69 70 dollars and I got 423 and
then the next thing I got was this
Henley looking top it's gray and has the
kind of V there right there scoop neck
just got it in an extra-small and this
was like ten dollars usually like thirty
I think it's really cute and will be
good for the wintertime stuff like that
the next thing I got at dry secret
that's what it's just a sports bra but
it's it's this hot pink sports bra um
that looks like this I don't own
anything like this at all it's from vsx
and it's just like a neon pink color
like $15 which is really good for a
sports bra specially from Victoria's
Secret and it was usually 44 50 next
place I went was American Apparel and I
don't own anything from American Apparel
now
I think everything that they have is so
cute so the first thing I got there was
this white crop top sorry if things are
wrinkly I had to take them on the
airplane but it's this white crop top
that buttons up and it is super cute and
I really like the fit of it and I just
got a small and it's usually 25 and it
was 19
it's very cute and basic and I don't
have anything like this actually so then
the next thing I got from American
Apparel was this baseball tee and it's a
crop baseball tee and I was going to get
this in light grey but I got another
thing in light grey so I decided against
it but I really just liked the plain
black one and I think it's gonna be cute
cuz I always it shorts your jeans or
anything like that this was $20 but I
think it's super cute the next thing I
got from American Apparel was this grey
crop top and it's super hard to show
okay so let's like that really what then
it crosses in the front like this with
these ties so it's like that it's really
hard to show but it's super cute on and
I really like it and I just got to next
your small is also $19 and I don't I
don't know anything like this so and
then the next place I went to was pack
sign and they had a lot of cute things
at PacSun so the first thing I got were
these shorts and I think they're perfect
for summer they're like a maroon
burgundy color and they just have these
cutouts at the bottom and they're from
brandy melville so they're one size and
they're so lightweight and really
comfortable and they're on sale from 33
to 27 so then the next thing I got at
PacSun also from brandy melville is this
white bra let that has this crossing
over in the front and I have something
like this in black from forever 21 and I
think it looks really cute under strips
just to like dress it up a little bit or
just add a little accent so I really
liked the white one so I thought I would
get the white one this was $20 and I
really like how it looks under
or cut shirts and then I got this shirt
also from brandy melville I don't really
have a brandy Melville store and near me
except for it PacSun so and they had a
lot of brandy melville things that I
hadn't seen before so that's why I got a
couple of those things it's just really
light pink v-neck it's flowy and it's
not that long and it's not that short
it's like the perfect length and this
was $24 and it looked really cute with
the white bralette actually that I just
showed so I got that and so soft and
comfortable too then the next place I
went to was Chili's and I really
actually like Tilly's but we don't have
a Chili's near me I spent a good amount
of money since when I went there so I
was like no I'm just gonna live it
myself and not get a lot of things so I
just got one thing but I really like it
and it's this army greeting um tank top
and it's not like skin-tight but it's
not like super loose but I just liked it
tight at the bottom and it also looked
really cute with the white packs
umbrella that I just showed and this is
only ten dollars and yeah I really like
it so the next place I went to was
Calvin Klein and I have never been to a
Calvin Klein
nor have I owned anything from Calvin
Klein and if you guys have not heard of
the really famous for all let's I got
one and I just got the black one and it
says Calvin Klein the band on the bottom
and this is 20% off but I really liked
it and I didn't know whether to get the
gray white or black one but I have a
gray one from Detroit secret so I
thought don't get the black one and I
really liked it um and I just got in a
medium because this mole did not cover
enough for me I thought might as well
get the matching underwear I just don't
feel awkward it's okay they're kind of
like boy short but then also a little
cheeky but they just look like this and
they have the band and a lot of people
wear them with like boyfriend jeans so
the band shows and they're like not sag
but they like show the band on purpose
so I just got these in small to match
that and those were both connectors in
opposites it was an outlet so then next
place so much he was neky I really
enjoyed their outlet actually but the
first thing I got
there were these gray shorts and I these
are so comfortable and feathered gray
and you can workout in these or just
showing these and they're usually fifty
and I got them for $24.99 but I think
they're super cute and then the tie here
just has some silver detailing on it I
really like them and I just got them in
a extra small so yeah and then the next
thing I got from Nike which is probably
one of my favorite pickups of the entire
trip actually is this half zip jacket
and it is white it's so soft and
comfortable it's dry fit has some silver
detailing on it and they only had a
medium in any color they don't even have
small or extra or anything but I like
the looser fit so it's not like skin
tight so I can chill mitt if I want but
I can also work out in it because it's
dry fit material and it's just white and
I really like the look of it so yeah I
picked this up and this was usually I
think 70 or 65 I got for 40 I'm happy
about that so then I also got something
and I get a wild back I actually got
this at Target I didn't get at that lip
but it is this Nike hat and it's black
and has a white Nike swoosh on it so
yeah I got bit and I really liked it and
I think was like twenty dollars I got
from Target and then another thing I got
from Target in Florida was this shirt
shirt that says United States on it with
the United States flag and I like it
it's comfortable and cute so yeah and it
was like thank dollars so I mean it was
actually twelve but and then another
thing I got at Target which I wore in
Florida a lot was this black romper is
super comfortable and basic and I really
liked the look of it just like twenty
dollars I believe oh another okay
where's everything and then another
thing for summer which I picked up a
while back actually I thought I'd show
are some ray-bans because I don't have
any good quality sunglasses so I thought
I would invest in some nice quality
ray-ban and they're just the aviator
style and I like them a lot they are the
polarized ones so when you look at your
phone
it's like rainbow so I just got these
they're definitely something to invest
in but I haven't broken them and scratch
them or anything I'm taking good care of
them they came with a brown case and a
black case black case is over there
somewhere but it's just black and has
both here and then this is brown black
here so yeah I really have more news all
the time to protect my eyes so yeah so
then the next place that I'm going to
show is Windsor and they were kind
enough to send me some stuff to show you
guys and I really like everything that I
received all the things are super cutest
thing I'm going to show I'm actually
wearing right now take a look show you
guys it has some dandelion flowers in
the jar so it's like wishes like dream
of wishes and then it has a cute little
pendant on it and then the chain just
has some gold detailing and I think it's
so cute
make you feel like I'm wearing wishes
around my neck I don't know I really
like it and I really like it for like
layering necklaces too and then the next
piece of jewelry that I got were these
rings these eight pack of rings and
they're super cute they fit me and I
really like them so I'm going to be
wearing these a lot so the next thing I
got was a super cute shirt and I love
this color
so it's this burgundy kind of sweater
knit top and it has a v cut and it's not
really cross but it's like the perfect
length and it fits me perfectly it's the
size extra small it's so cute and
comfortable so I really really like this
and it just looks here like a raw diet
or plain or anything like that so then
the next thing that I got were these
pants and there are these boyfriend
jeans that I got a size one and these um
they fit pretty well as boyfriend jeans
I think that if I got in a size smaller
there would be like a little more skin
type but these are like a little loose
like a little skin type so I think it's
actually the perfect size but I do wear
a belt with them and they're just this
light denim
with these rips and they're super cute
and I really like the look of boyfriend
jeans so I got these in a size one and I
really like them and they're just cuffed
at the bottom so yeah the last thing
that they sent me was this pencil skirt
and I actually have no black pencil
skirts but this pencil skirt just has
some of mesh it has some mesh right here
I think this is going to be really nice
for like kind of fancier occasions
because I don't really own anything like
this and I just got a size small and I
think it's super cute and comfortable
yeah that's everything Windsor sent me
