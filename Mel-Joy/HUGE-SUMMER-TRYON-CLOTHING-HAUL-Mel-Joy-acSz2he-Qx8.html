shopping problem I feel less guilty
about shopping this time because I just
cleaned out my closet and I got rid of a
ton of clothes so I like rewarded myself
with new clothes oh and I forgot to say

clothes on my body
that sounded kinda creepy so you guys

feedback on it you say that you like

that please don't hate or anything I'm
not trying to brag no nothing like that
you guys just have told me to keep doing
it this family I bought everything with
my own money people always comment on
the parents boiler like no I have a job
I buy my own things just to throw that
out there for you guys I'm not trying to
brag or anything I went shopping and I
thought I'd show you guys because you
guys really seem to like hauls so they
shoes look like this are they cute okay
I'm sorry I'm obsessed with them I think
they're so adorable they're like this
leather material and they're like a topi
eggshell white color and I love them
these were I think $150 which are kind
of you know pricey
I just couldn't not good they're so cute
I'm obsessed with them and number
excited to wear these and yeah so the
next place I'm going to show you guys
that I got is Victoria's Secret Joe we
talked about helping to our secret is
discontinuing their swim line I see it
all my swimsuits that Victoria Secret
and I can't and I'm bummed but the
Victoria's Secret just came out with a I
think new line of bralette and they were
so adorable and they were having a good
sale - they were twenty dollars each so
everything I'm gonna be showing you in
the next couple of things or twenty
dollars if you guys are not needing my
channel you know how much I realized and
how much I love them because I think it
can just add so much like detail to an
outfit you know so the first problem I
got is this white one and what I love
about this one is that it's padded it's
just it's a good time come on guys it's
so cute so the back is racerback
and then the front clips in the front
and I got it in an extra small because
it even a titty committee
the next part I got is this green one
guys they just nailed these varlets I'm
gonna be honest it's so cute so this is
this army green bra light it's also
padded which I appreciate and I also got
an extra small this one is just so cute
and goes a little bit lower like and
really cute under this you know I love
Brella I got that one and then the last
one I got is this grey one
I don't know if I'm crazy about this one
but I kind of reminded me of like the
Free People Urban Outfitters all that
stuff but it's like dark grey and I
think it's cute this one's not padded I
got it in a small on this one so the
next thing I'm gonna show is just a hat
because you know you've got to stay
protected in the summertime but this hat
is from adidas and it looks like this I
get you like cute it's just like this
khaki color and then says adidas in
black and then has like a what color is
this like a dark grayish hacky color as
the logo and I think it's super cute I
bought that on Amazon also and it was
$20 so now I'm going to show you guys
some shorts that I picked up I literally
have no shorts so I really needed to get
something I got all these app packs done
because they were having a crazy deal it
was like by oh and go and half off yeah
that's what it was and then some were
also just don't sale for like $20 or
less so it was just it was a good time
to go the first pair of shorts I got to
the super-stretch shorty a darker color
these were definitely in about goin half
off these are 24 I like super weird with
pants and things like I'll just be all
over the place
in my sizes just nice basic shorts to
have with the cuffs and the distressing
it's cute so cute so then the next pair
of shorts I got or actually I think the
exact same style super-stretch shorty
but in a 23 see my sizing is just really
weird those I don't think they have them
in 23 and the 24 like did look bad so I
was like you know what I want them
whatever like hey if they fit me and I
feel comfortable in them and I like them
doesn't matter what size I'm gonna get
them they were part of the buy one get
one half off as well if they're the
exact same shorts as those but just in a
different shade and I really like them
and then these are super cute they're
like these distressed like acid wash
shorts it says high rise if they're not
really super high rise and I got them in
a 23 and they're very very cute they're
usually 39.95 and they were part of
about get one half off too I believe
and then these ones are just like black
shorts they're from brandy melville
brandy bubble has sizes now like what
darkness eyes 23 and they have like all
these buttons down but you button them
and they're just like black basic shorts
with some distressing here and really
kind of high-rise kind of not like in
the middle yeah and I don't have any
black shorts and I really wanted black
shorts because black shorts are cute
also app packs ton I got this bikini top
I think it's so cute it's this light
blue color but it's like crocheted and
it's halter it's from the Kendall +
Kylie collection I got it in extra small
and it was 3995
I'm like in need of some suits so so I
picked that up so now I'm going to show
you guys this stuff that I got a brandy
melville so the first thing I'm actually
wearing right now it is this distressed
kind of like there's some holes in it
and stuff long white t-shirt it's pretty
long but I really like it and to wear
like brought lats with it it's just a
basic that I feel like you can dress up
or dress down and it really cute and I
like it super soft and this was I think
oh no I took the price out off of a 20
to 30 somewhere in that range
I'm sorry and it's one size fits all so
and then the next thing I'll show you
with just these socks or just these
smiley face socks well as I was checking
out I saw them I was like they're cute I
want them so I got them and they're just
I don't know they make me happy
forgotten they were $6 so then the next
shirt I got is this band T Rolling
Stones shirt it just has the mouth with
the tongue and it's black and it's
pretty big but I have been so into band
tees and this was $28
I got all the like basics because I
actually don't
somebody like basic plain like shirts
that I can like dress up or just and so
I'm happy that I got to pick up some of
those basic things like I feel like
they're kind of staples you know so then
I got this shirt and this is just this
gorgeous blue like crop top and I think
there's deodorant on it I'm so sorry it
just has some distressing what kind of
glue is this it's like a faded blue e
gray it was $16 one size and it's just
like kind of cropped you know in the
next shirt it's not the exact same shirt
but it's pretty similar it doesn't have
any distressing but it's just like a
black crop top it's also $16 I don't
know I feel like it's a staple that I
did not have but I have now so I'm happy
about it and I feel like shirts like
that look really cute with like a Rolla
and like a choker and yeah so then the
next shirt I got this super cute white
top like kind of cropped kind of know
that like kind of fitted kind of not I
don't know $26.00 one size I feel like
these are also really good for the
summer just throws like shorts and just
go out and not be like do hot or
anything so happy that I picked up some
nice tees because I'm really into the
whole tee thing now and also when I went
to the brandy melville store they were
handing out these little bracelets they
had gold or silver and I just think the
silver ones I think it's cute just a
little beaded a beaded bracelet it's
usually five dollars so so then the next
place I went to was Lululemon you guys
didn't know I'm going on a cruise I
don't know if this video is going to be
out before after the cruise but we're
doing like yoga on the cruise I like
leggings and stuff but it's going to be
so hot so I wanted to get kind of like
lighter weight pants or the dance studio
crop to line pants and they look like
this I think they'd also be really good
for working out too or just chilling and
I got them in a two and they're so cute
it just says the Lulu sign right here
the material is really good on these
some excited tour these on the cruise
these were $98 cause Lululemon is
expensive everyone knows that but they
have really good quality things so yeah
at Lululemon I also picked up this
headband it's just white and has a
silver Lululemon sign and this was $12 I
have a lot of flyaways like a lot of
flyaway so this will be good when I want
to chain my hair when I work out and it
has this cool like gripping on the
inside so it won't fall off your head so
then the next place I went to was Urban
Outfitters and I
of Urban Outfitters I have not been
Urban Outfitters in so long so I got a
good amount of things so the first thing
I got is another band T this is the
Grateful Dead I have listened to them
with my mom before and you know good
time so so I picked this up the back
looks like this super cute and I got in
a small and it was 39 which is kind of
you know pricey for a banty but I just
felt like treating myself guys it was a
treat yourself day I kind of went crazy
but I'm gonna try to lay off the
shopping now move to the next top I got
is a super cute crocheted halter kind of
a basic halter I've said cute so many
times I'm so sorry and it's just like a
fitted crop top and this will be really
good for the cruise I got a lot of stuff
for the cruise I got it in extra-small
and it was $39 it's like it a lot and I
don't have any shirts like this so then
the next should I got I think is a
really unique shirt and I really don't
own anything like this and it's just
Croft like army green loose crotch sure
but it's like fitted up in the top and
like flows out but this was $34 I got it
in an extra small the material is really
soft and nice I'm excited to weigh this
so then the next thing I got there these
jeans they're high-waisted they look
like this they go down and then they're
kind of like mom jeans kind of not like
I don't know how to explain it but
they're cuffed I got a minute 24 waist
and 26 length so they're like cropped
and they're $79 but they're bdg
girlfriend jeans that's what they are
and the Jean materials like really nice
and like sturdy so then the next thing I
got it Urban Outfitters was this dress
light blue gray color I got in it extra
small as $49 and it has this really cute
like tie detail which I love and then
the last thing I got at Urban Outfitters
I also have to return because I picked
up the wrong size because I mean I am in
love with these varlets I have a black
and white one um they're so so so cute
so I really wanted just like wine maroon
one but I'm definitely keeping it
because I love this color like it would
look slim cute on business you know and
this is $20 so it's a good deal and it's
really cute but I messed up with the
sizing dony to them from Free People I
think it picked this up at Macy's or
notions I don't remember but I got it in
a small because they didn't have an
extra small but it still fit it was all
good I was like yeah I'm just gonna get
it it's like white and then has this
lace detailing and then
like these kind of polka-dots like light
gray this is for my cruise because it's
really like lightweight material and
it's better for like a fancier dinner
I'm gonna wear it with a slip don't
worry
and I think this is actually on sale
it's $88 regularly my mom and I had a
coupon so we got a good deal so I saved
some money on this so then also from
Macy's I picked up these pants and I
love them and are super comfortable
they're from Calvin Klein they're just
like these cropped gray sweatpants I've
been really into like wearing sweat
pants with like crop tops and I just
think it looks really cute and like
comfy and casual we also use the coupon
for these I got him in a small and
they're $49 and then from North Shore I
picked up a couple of things the first
thing for these sunglasses only really
have like one pair of sunglasses um so I
thought I'd get some more they were
pretty cheap and they're really cute and
oh they have like matte detailing up on
the front to the sides are also matte
and they're kind of like cat eye
sunglasses and I really like I'm is the
price on here I think they were $12 but
they're from like the BP section and
then the nice thing I got from the BP
section is this white crop top and guys
this is so cute this was actually on
sale for 960 usually 16 dollars so that
was a really good deal it's just this
ribbed like almost turtleneck top and
it's so cute I'm really excited to wear
this yeah and I got it in an extra small
and then the next thing is just this
white crop top from the BP section I got
in an extra small as well and this is
only $12 but I think it might have been
on sale because I got it on the sale
rack it's definitely a good staple to
have so then the next thing I got is so
cute I'm obsessed with it I think it
looked really cute with like a v-neck or
like a low-cut shirt I don't even know
how I can show this you guys it's like a
bra let that wraps around your neck
right here it almost looks like a choker
but you know it's not and it has this
really cute detailing like so it's
almost like caged looks like that and I
got in a small/medium and it was $28
which is kind of expensive for like a
little piece of cloth like this but I
think it can add a lot to an outfit so
hopefully sort of it so yeah that was
everything I got in my big haul for
summer I'm really happy with everything
