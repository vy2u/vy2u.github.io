Bethany today I'm going to be doing a
question and answers video before I get

you should follow my Twitter and
Instagram because that's where you guys
can ask me questions for Q one night cuz
that's where I'm gonna be doing them in
the future
so you guys should definitely go follow
them right here Mel underscore joy with
three wise both I'm keeping it easy for
you guys so I have some questions
I'm goin in right now legit Elizabeth
asks what's your favorite brain PS I
love you so much
and I love you more and my favorite
brand of clothing or a makeup I use of
makeup I like I really like benefit I
think that's probably my favorite right
now and for clothing I was like Paxton
and forever 21
Hollister has been coming out with like
cute stuff recently too and she has been
where have I been
I'm going to address this later because
another person asked this question
nyow Mayer oh man asked if you had the
choice to travel what place would you
travel to right now probably either
somewhere tropical like the Bahamas or
the Caribbean Paris because I've been to
Spain before it was beautiful so I'd
love to explore the rest of the Europe
its Leanne asked what's your favorite
food
that's a hard push I really like food I
really like I've been getting into
Mexican food recently and I've always
liked pizza because they pretty much our
dad asks what is your must-have summer
essential well probably flip-flops
they're over there
my rainbow flip-flops because four flops
I just really like all the time in the
summer or like a bathing suit or tinted
moisturizer because you can cover up
your flaws but you're also getting SPF
and moisturization and it's just it's
good Elizabeth so Lirio asks what is my
favorite song so okay so this artist
that I love named black bear came out
with his new album dead rose
recently I've been listening to it
non-stop and my favorite song right now
is probably not on - I know from this
album outlet I also like body 8 by
purity ring my friend from track showed
me this song if you guys want to check
out my Spotify to me myself and Mel's
two L's and you can see all the songs
I'm listening to name or asked if you
could be any celebrity who would you be
also winner three things you can't live
without I love you so much you're my
favorite youtubers ever thank you so
much that means a lot to me and I love
you more and if I give you any celebrity
if you have seen skins Effie you're
ready or she's just like I'm just
obsessed with her she was a maze runner
she's just like I think she's just great
no no that's a that's a hard question
and then what are three things I can't
live without okay I'm gonna be
completely honest my phone can I use do
my friends and family count it's like
the things I can't live with that I
cannot live without music that's one of
my big things music I am literally
listening music 24/7 right before I go
to bed when I wake up when I'm at school
when I'm home dad just I always come
here but then I'm always asleep and
pollen tree 28 this favorite band of all
time my favorite band of all time is
probably Bastille or 1975 just because I
can never not listen to their music like
it's just always there for me and I love
every one of their songs and they never
get old you know like there are songs
that get old and that you just can't
listen to anymore but like any of their
songs I can listen to whenever and I
I'm never gonna get sick of them Makenna
Rose asked to pull it you're talking
about 12 legs about long I lost upon one
I've been getting a recent addiction to
Chipotle she's really good I mean Taco
Bell's also pretty good but Foley's
healthier
I think McKenna Rose also asks what's
your biggest fear is losing the people I
love most like my friends and my family
and just my loved ones yeah destiny
Robinson s what are your plans for the
summer so I'm going to Florida to visit
my grandparents which is gonna be
awesome and just to chill with my
friends and go with the women and have a
good time play our basketball I don't
know I might go to Ireland which I'm
super pumped for because that's my home
laid
imma fill it Fallot sorry yes how do you
stay positive also a drugstore mascara
do you prefer okay I really like the
question of how do you stay positive
so how actually positive personally is
that even though you're going through
like a really rough time right now or
you were before you can always think
like what you have and I always count my
blessings like my family and my friends
and everything like that i roof over my
head i food on my table and I think that
there's always the future and things
will get better because I mean if things
I'm getting better than it's nothing and
I don't know I just I hope you guys can
all stay positive and just count your
blessings and think about the good
things in your life and just if you want
to change something make it happen and
yeah just think about the good times and
forget about the bad times because those
are in the past and that doesn't matter
anymore and living the president just
make the best of now and sorry to get a
little deep there but that's a message
to guys
