hey guys it's Mel so what's your name
well that's my friend Ella for you just
come here I want to say thank you from a
video come here oh thank you to Ella for
filming this video so you helped me um
film my video could've done without you
fun time doing it
anyway so today I'm going to be talking
about how to get a bikini body for
summer because summer is coming up so
I'm going to be just showing you a
workout that I do almost every day I
don't do the running part every day just
because I do sports at my school so like
tracks so I run a lot then but I do the
mini like fitness workout just like
strengthen your abs and your legs and
your arms almost every night and I'm
just gonna cover what I do yeah let's
just get started with the video so
something I like to do when I didn't run
at school or for our sports team is to
go on a run and I really like running in
the nature so here I am just stretching
out doing some leg pulls and touching my
toes stretching out my back in my arms
and then leg lifts and stretching up my
quads so I don't get injured while I'm
running and you can't forget about those
lunges so a must for me when I'm running
is to listen to music so I just use my
Spotify Premium and put my earbuds in
and then I'm off
so the distance I do really actually
depends on how I feel that day but I
usually do around a mile or a little
more than that and make sure when you
guys work out to drink a lot of water so
you don't get dehydrated so after I ran
I just drank some water so then right
after I run I stretch which is really
important because you don't want to get
injured so here I'm just stretching out
my legs on this fence that I found and
ignore that a leaf on my butt and I'm
also doing a butterfly stretch one leg
in one out touching my toes and I also
stretch out my hips so I just stay
really loosened up
and then after I stretch I get to do abs
which is my personal favorite so here
I'm doing 30 crunches and I'm just
speeding it up for you guys so and make
sure to keep your legs together your
knees together and make sure your feet
don't get off the floor because that'll
give you the best workout you can get so
I'm just showing you how I do my
crunches I do 30 of them and then after
I do my 30 crunches I do 30 sit-ups and
also make sure to keep your knees
together and your feet on the ground and
just go all the way up and put your
hands by your ears and that'll give you
a really good workout and by putting
your hands by your ears it lets you use
just your abs to bring you up and not
your hands so after I do my crunches and
my sit-ups I just do a plank and I
usually do them for one-minute intervals
and I'll do sometimes a couple of these
three if I'm feeling fancy and then
after that I'll do these leg stabilizer
things I don't know what they're called
but you just sold your feet a couple
inches above the ground and it really
burns so I just do that for a minute -
and then after that I'll do 30 of these
kind of leg lifts they're kind of
awkward looking but they really help
your lower abs that's why I do then and
breathe in each time you bring your legs
up because that'll really help so the
next thing I'm working on is arms and
chest so I'm just doing ten push-ups for
this and I like to keep it easy for that
and the next thing I do is legs in butt
and I do 50 squats or 30 if I'm feeling
tired on the day but usually fifty and
I'm just showing you different angles so
you can see how to do them so you keep
your legs shoulder-width apart and then
just squat down as low as you can and go
back up and then the next thing I'm
doing are these leg lifts and these
helped a lot in your upper thigh in your
lower butt area and I'm just doing 30 on
each side and yeah so just put your leg
under your stomach and then up in the
air and just repeat that on both sides
so this exercise might also look a
little awkward but it really helps that
your inner thighs and I just do about 30
of these over and over again and you
just kind of spread your legs as far as
you can and then close them and then
just do that over and over so the last
thing I do is just a little full body
thing and I just do 50 jumping jacks but
I try to do them fairly fast I didn't do
them full speed here but usually I do
them as fast as I can and that just kind
of gets my heart rate going and it
finishes my exercise so I hope you guys
