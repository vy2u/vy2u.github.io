new year is just like whole new journey
limited Mendes asked will this be in

AHA I love you so much I love you so

she also asks favorite memory of 2015
probably one of my favorite memories was
either getting my license I just
remember being so happy or getting my
first car I was like extremely happy I'm
still happy now I have not told YouTube
this yet I was gonna save it for a
separate video but I guess I'll just
talk about it now I bought my first car
ever a couple weeks ago with my own
money I saved up it is my child it's my
baby I love it um it is my dream car
it's the car always wanted it is a Jake
Patriot I got it in 2015 it is used it
was a rental car but it is in great
shape because you know rental cars keep
their cars in great shape functions well
drives great it's white a Jeep Patriot I
think I just said that and I was gonna
do like a what's in my car video like a
cart or if you guys wanted to see that
thumbs up this video and comment down
below and I will definitely do that but
I wasn't sure about it yeah I got a good
deal on it it's something that I felt
really passionate about I really like
cars I really like driving my parents
did not buy it for me I did buy it with
my own money that I have worked for so
please no hate on that but if you guys
want to see a video let me know so that
was probably one of my favorite memories
or just spending time with family
friends I made a lot of new friends this
year I'm very happy about I love making
new friends my youtube definitely my
youtube grew in 2015 I'm really
underscore slays yes you do asks what
keeps you motivated I'm making more
to videos I love you and please follow
me on Instagram if it's no problem I'll
definitely follow you on Instagram
I will definitely follow you in this
game and I love you too and what keeps
me motivated on making YouTube videos
well first of all YouTube is just
something that makes me happy
YouTube is something really passionate
about just making YouTube videos and
editing them and putting them up for you
guys and talking to you guys is
absolutely one of my favorite things
ever motivates me just all motivates me
and having like you guys out there that
enjoy my videos and like comment on them
and just like thinking about it makes me
so happy it's insane to me knowing that
like a group of people wow this is
getting emotional sorry uh-huh but it's
just insane knowing that like a group of
people supports my channel they say such
nice things to me they want to talk to
me I love responding to you guys on
Twitter or on in shame or anything like
that I think YouTube is a really cool
thing and what motivates me personally I
love posting videos for you guys I
personally just love doing it it's
something I love I don't know just a lot
of things that's motivating me about it
Sara Richmond asks how do you deal with
fake friends oh girl don't get me
started on fake friends they're out my
years especially as I've grown up I have
encountered a couple fake friends it's
no fun especially when you get really
close to someone and then you find out
about them being a favorite like come on
and I think just the hardest part for me
about it is just like you let them in
you let them get close to you and then
they kind of hurt you and you're like
wow like that hurt I think how to do
with fake friends is personally if
they're not supplying you happiness and
they're just like making your life not
as enjoyable cut them off and I know
that sounds really harsh I need to blow
my nose
BRB I don't even know say it like if
they're doing negative things to you and
just to the people you love why are you
keeping them and I think that if you
have fake friends you deserve better you
need to know that you deserve better you
can find a better friend I'm here to
tell you that if you guys want a
separate video on fake friends and just
social life in general let me know and I
can do that yeah I guess that's my
insight on a friend's a little bit my
magetta
asks do you love me yes I do love you
one day love 7 2 3 1 OS New Year's
resolution I have a lot of New Year's
resolutions just because this year I
feel like I experienced a lot to wear
wanna like benefit myself in 2016 by
doing my New Year's resolutions I was
going to do a video on that like a
separate video of New Year's resolutions
if you guys want to see that like this
video and comment down below cuz I can
definitely make that for you guys but
some of mine are just like eating
healthy take care of my body more like
taking care of yourself kind of discover
like what you made what makes you happy
and a focus on that so it benefits you
everyday so your your happiest every day
I really want to focus on like happiness
in 2016 I think that's something that's
important to me I guess is to be happy
Kati simps asks which one if dogs wore
pants what do you wear them like this or
like this I'll show you the photo
personally I think it's this one because
birth weight because technically these
are like their front legs right I feel
like it's this one if you know when you
they stand up it would be like that but
if they stood up if you like their whole
body covered with pants if it was other
way but also their natural way to stand
is like that no because when we go on
all fours our pants are still on our
bottom ah yeah I'm gonna say that one
that's what I think I don't know let me
know what you guys think down below Jax
23 asks what do you think about
self-confidence what would you say to
people who aren't confident with
themselves I also want to say about
self-confidence also so if you guys want
another video if you guys want any type
of videos kind of more like talks just
about life not even you know like beauty
and fashion let me know down below cuz I
can definitely do those if those will
like benefit and help you guys they were
it's like you have to take your own
advice and I'm so bad at doing that you
have to realize that you are who you are
you need to like love yourself before
you can love other people or almost
you're just gonna like engulf all of
yourself into someone else and then
you're just gonna like get hurt I guess
self-confidence I think is really
important especially these days just cuz
there's so many like ways that people
can like beat down on you through social
media I think if you're self-confident
it I don't know I think it provides you
happiness in a way and I think it also
makes you more like you know like
strong-willed I guess and I think it's
also a really important thing for your
own mistake because when you're
self-confident you just like feel better
about everything you do and you feel
like stronger and what I would tell
someone who doesn't feel
Coffee is you were put on this earth the
way you are you have every right to feel
confident because you're perfect the way
you are you got I know that's cheesy I
know I'm being cheesy self confidence is
such a big issue in our world now just
because everyone like wants to compare
themselves to other people like I'm
going off-track here but if you don't
feel self-confident let me tell you that
you should you have every XPO
self-confident and you're gonna love
your self but I would love to do another
video on topics like these similar to
these if you guys want those let me know
because I could ramble on and on layna
bliss asks what do you think about karma
karma I think that I don't really know
what I think about Karma but I think
that if you try to be the best person
you can be it will benefit you later in
life but it's also like some people you
know can be so mean but so successful so
I don't know I don't know about Karma
I'm still trying to figure that out do
you feel me oh is any Hughes asked
weirdest fan experience I haven't had a
lot of like weird fan experiences at all
but what's weird to me is that like
someone will come out to be like are you
Mel joy something I was like well you
know who like yeah the YouTube is like
all online so like when you meet your
subscribers in real life you're like wow
you're actually person what like you

just cool ones you know and she also
asks can you make it public snapchat I

Nash JKL asked has any fan ever said hi
to you in public I love you so much I
love you more and I just kind of
answered this but yeah I've had a couple
of run-ins two people one in a football
game for my friend's school one in
Sports Authority just in some other
areas but I love meeting you guys

username of I'm she says I love you so
so much and what is your recommend go-to
advice for girls dealing with guys I
love you more and guys is definitely
like a whole different subject
in fact guys is to be yourself a hundred
percent be yourself I definitely learned
the hard way they should like you for
who you are that would probably be my
I suggest to yourself Alison MTV 11s how
do you balance forts YouTube schoolwork
and spending time with family friends
love you I love you too
and I struggle with dealing honestly if
I could have the dream life I would be
posting on YouTube a couple times a week
not just one time in a week or every
however weeks I've been posting I would
be able to hang off friends whenever I
wanted to get all my schoolwork done and
go to basketball but that is not
possible I think that I'm just learning
more about balancing it as I progress on
YouTube and in school and with friends
in basketball I just really have to
manage my time like over there I have a
calendar with everything I need to do
for YouTube managing your time it's a
big part of it I try to be like to do
lists sorry like cross them off and I'm
done and like make little schedules you

like 20 minutes if I did not answer your
question in this video stay tuned for
the next Q&amp;amp;A and I'll try to answer any
more questions I hope you guys enjoy
