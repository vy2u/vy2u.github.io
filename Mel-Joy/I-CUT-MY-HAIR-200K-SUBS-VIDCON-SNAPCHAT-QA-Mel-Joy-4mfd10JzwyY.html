back to my channel I have a couple
things I want to announce before I do my
snapchat Q&amp;amp;A so the first thing is I hit
200,000 subscribers I can't believe it
you guys are honestly amazing I love
each and every one of you right there
watching me anyone who subscribed to my
channel it means so much and I don't
want to take up too much time but I just
wanted to thank you guys I'm so grateful
it's an amazing feeling I never thought
that I would get this far you guys
supply me with so much joy and happiness
in my life
it's obviously crazy to me thinking that
200,000 people are subscribed to me I
love you guys stuff so much so I just
want it to stay that really quickly
before getting into the video and the
second thing is if you guys cannot tell
I got a haircut I actually cut my own
hair at like 2:00 in the morning yeah I
do things like that I'll just think you
know what I want a haircut I can't wait
to get my haircut so I'm just gonna do
it because I don't know I get my mind
set to something and then I want it
that's what happened my hair got cut
it's so much lighter and good for spring
I guess yeah just really quickly wanted
to address that cuz you guys are from
like Mel where did like fringe so your
hair go so now I'm going to be doing a
Q&amp;amp;A if you don't have me on my snapchat
it's me myself in my mouth with two L's
because me myself and male opponents
take it and I post some stories to show
you guys that I'm doing with my day or
just funny photos or whatever so you're
I should add me on and that if you
haven't already but I put something on
my story saying send me questions we're
gonna open them and I'm getting into
them let me make sure my volume is fully
on
well I love you too and the next time
I'm going to be doing a morning and
night routine is actually coming up so
you should stay tuned for that all right
if you meet with guys nope still very
suitable I have made some new
friendships but guys nope
I am currently dating myself so it's all
good you know I have food I have friends
family needs a boyfriend she says love
you by the way so I love you too and I
am so hoping to have some Ingrid's if I
got to meet you guys I would be so happy
about that I don't know I feel like
there would be so much fun so I'm hoping
to do some I'm going to VidCon I'm going
to VidCon and um June so I might do one
there's if any of you guys are going to
VidCon let me know down below I would
love love to do a meet-up there if any
of you guys are going I think that'd be
really cool I definitely want to do so
meetups in the future I talked about
this in my last video at my 25 questions
video or actually those two videos ago
huh come on but it was when someone
ignores you and doesn't tell you why
because I'm just like all right what did
I do
why won't you tell me and half the time
I feel like I didn't do anything and
they're just ignoring me for fun I'm
sorry
like come on be constant or be
straight-up about what I did if I did
anything I do think you're a good singer
you guys are literally the cutest things
in the world what I love you too
so I loved Vampire Diaries for a very
long time and I got super into it but
then I got into Pretty Little Liars
again because I was a chicken in like
eighth grade and I stopped watching it
but then I picked it up again two years
later I watched it's like the new
seasons that I hadn't seen and now I'm
obsessed with that so Pretty Little
Liars right now is up there oh that's so
sweet thank you so much Wow and she
lives in Canada that's really cool it
said love from Canada not that I know
where she lives that's what this is the
love from Callie's but thank you that
means so much to me miss su she said PS
Italy Italy - I love fruit that's a
really hard question I really like
mangoes like she if you guys have not
tried lychee like - I know people
pronounce it differently it's so good I
love it I also like bananas berries are
really good apples really just really
refreshing I don't know I need a lot of
fruit sorry if I'm moving around this
chairs distracting my dad was so
supportive of it he was like Mel I think
that'd be amazing he has always been
with me through this and so is my mom
definitely my mom she's a little more
nervous about it just like well they
were both like you know a little worried
but then they were also really
supportive about it because they knew
that I loved videography and they knew
that I loved to make up the combination
of two things I love so they were both
really supportive about it thanks fans
love you I love clueless and I really
just watched it last night but that
movie always cheers me up and I think
it's really cute I feel like I can just
watch that over and over and not get
sick of it also John Tucker Must Die
I've spent maybe so much with my sister
like that used to be our movie but I
love that and also duck in love used to
be like our movie
like we would just re-watch all those
things and perks of being a wallflower
those are like the thing movies you just
watch over and over and over again those
are probably my favorite movies so
really keep records okay I love you too
and oh my goodness Australia I love your
accent by the way my songs change so
frequently my favorite songs sorry
something with my hair less still not
really used it but I've been loving
Rihanna's new album auntie or ain't I or
never my favorite songs on that aren't
needed me yeah I said it and work yes
she said illy so Haley - Cinderella
story and another cinderella story those
two movies like my sister watches all
the time and I love those movies they
were so cute I love you - I first
started making YouTube videos this
summer going into freshman year so that
was like almost two years ago that is
such a hard question
oh my goodness I don't even know I
honestly I can't answer that question
because I have so many amazing memories
I'm a lot younger like what I hope to
live - there's so many memories I could
make I don't know no I love you - you're
so cute so I have been watching YouTube
for a super long time so there's so many
people that's inspired me some the
mainland's with makeup by Mandy 24
Maddie brag or you know max rose Beauty
one Lindsey and Megan Hughes like Mac
Barbie or Bethany Mota what inspired me
is just that I love doing makeup I love
fashion I love everything related to
that and I loved YouTube it was what I
always did for fun all the time and I
loved videography I used to make real
movies all the time with my friends so
it's like a combination of everything
and I just wanted to do something that
would also like help people you know
I can say something and multiple people
can see it and hopefully can help them I
wanted to help boost girls confidence I
just wanted to be someone I could give
people advice I can help them you know
all that stuff hey Aaron I love you too
and after my youtube career hopefully
it's not gonna end um but I want to be
in marketing in Spain kisses from
America that's such a tough question
probably like something with my family
like going on a vacation my friends our
YouTube you know like hitting a hundred
thousand subscribers I was an amazing
feeling or hitting two hundred thousand
subscribers you know I don't know I like
her and Stefan I'm gonna be honest
but I also like her Damon there's like
times where I like them but I think
Stefan because he's such a sweetheart
but I mean I my least favorite character
I haven't watched the show in a while so
I don't even the first original vampires
they pissed me off
hey Zoe and I figure out makeup brand I
used up the whole memory card so I had
to
I love you too and if you guys have not
seen my high school advice video and
you're going to ninth grade I have it I
posted it last year so you can go watch
that I'll link it down below my main
piece of advice is to be yourself if
you're completely completely yourself
you're gonna make the right friend
you're gonna feel your most confident
because if you're like putting on a
persona that you're not and then you
have to like hide in it like hide
yourself you're just gonna lose
confidence so just be yourself 100% I
love you too and I really like Paxton
they have really cute stuff Urban
Outfitters

going shopping today so stay tuned for a
haul

only have one make a product it would be

like so much fun just to travel the
world that's on my bucket list I just
want to do so many fun exciting things

live above life thank you so much you're
so sweet I'd be like Cabo or Paris she
says Italy so much so in the to probably
that I hit a hundred or two hundred
thousand or that I got my license the
day I got my license when the guy told
me like oh you passed I was beyond happy

gave me the keys to my car when I bought
my car he's like here you go it
