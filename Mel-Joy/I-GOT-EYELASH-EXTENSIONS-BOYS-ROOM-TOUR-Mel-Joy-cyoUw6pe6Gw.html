CatDog Bailey asks how did you cut your
own hair so perfectly haha well thank
you I have been cutting hair since I was
really young girl my friends hair dye my
friend Sarah I was I was always really
into hair so I kind of taught myself and
I would just watch what the barber was
doing I looked up tutorials and I just
kind of experimented I have cut my hair
badly several times like in third grade
it was real bad I had bangs up to here
just kind of taught myself you feel and
why dot Jessica says can I be in your

in my video and I love you so much to
underscore Ashley Molly asked do you see
yourself continuing YouTube when you're
older yes YouTube is something that
makes me so happy and I honestly think
YouTube is such an amazing thing like it
kind of like blows my mind sometimes
that people can just like put out
anything and they can create like a base
of people that watches that I don't know
I think it's really cool I don't have a
time I want to stop
I just don't bitch too
Kaleigh dot Murray asks what is the best
thing that has ever happened to since
you started your channel Lily Lily -
this is like a really hard question
there's so many things that I've just
been so grateful for first of all I
think you guys just as a whole is like
one of the best things that's ever
happened to me hands down all of you
guys watch my videos you guys support me
you'll DM me old I don't know it like
it's kind of mind-boggling that I have
this many people subscribe to me I did
not expect to get this far when I
started my YouTube I'm so grateful for
all of you guys and so I think that's
probably the main thing and also just
experience is like getting to go to LA
see awesomeness TV like I'm going to
VidCon in the summer like that's crazy
I've always wanted to go to VidCon x-dot
no I'll ask how did it feel not wearing
face makeup for a week you guys didn't
know I put a picture on Instagram I
haven't been wearing face makeup at all
like just school or anything
I'm or face makeup right now just
because I'm going somewhere later I got
eyelash extensions I also didn't tell
you guys this but yeah you guys who are
telling me that I use way too much
mascara and my eyelashes are gonna fall
out I don't have to deal with that
anymore
I love eyelash extensions so much so I
haven't been wearing makeup recently
because I have my ash extensions that I
just kind of feel like I don't want to
put on extra makeup and I really really
like my lashes so I haven't been wearing
face makeup I would recommend it so much
my face feels so much more refreshed
when you don't put a ton of product on
your face everyday like you don't
realize how good it is for your skin to
like not wear that face makeup and it's
starting to really right I just moved
where there is something above me so the
rain won't get on me after why you just
kind of get used to it and you're like
you know what I don't really even need
face makeup and I honestly love the
natural look of people you know showing
their true skin because that's what you
were born with and that's like you look
beautiful with a Vetala face makeup it
would definitely recommend it to all of
you out there it was more than a week
ever since I got my eyelashes tensions I
like don't wear makeup to school also
because I'm doing this foam unit at my
school which is really really great if
any of you guys end up not my face
makeup tweet me a picture or Instagram
and tag me and show your natural face
because your face is beautiful without
all that ace makeup on there that's just
extra sigh Kim Chi asked when are you
going to do a room tour so many of you
guys have been requesting for me to do
my room still isn't done and I haven't
in time to like fully complete it
because cool just been really busy and

think I'm going to finish it hopefully
in this summer I'm just gonna get
everything how I want it and then I'm
gonna come up room tour it's not going
to be coming like super soon just
because I haven't had the time to
completely fix it but I'm sorry I know
you guys really want to see it but it's

Olivia LG ten asked how much do you love
your subscribers I love you guys more
than you know and I've been serious
about this like it's kind of hard to
like express their love for someone
through like a camera but I love you
guys a lot I love you guys a lot a lot a
lot like I say in every video to Vinnie
and Beyond lens dot 16s is that your
natural hair color some other people ask
this question too or if I get dyed this
is my natural hair color the only time
I've ever dyed my hair is what I'm doing
like a fun color in like sixth grade I
dyed my hair almost every color of the
rainbow not all of my head or anything
SIA pink highlights I had a purple
stripe I had blue tipz and a lot of
different colors in my hair this is my
natural Harry Jess pearly as can s be in
your video Oh to think about it just
kidding yes Amy joy seventeen ask what's
the hardest thing about being on YouTube
that's a really good question I think
the hardest thing about being on YouTube
is for me honestly I look at myself as
kind of a perfectionist like when I
watched my video like I think like what
will you guys think of it and I want you
guys you know like it and to enjoy it
and stuff so I put a lot of work in my
videos like sometimes you get the
realization like this many people are
watching my videos like I need them to
be good and so you kind of just like for
your horn soul enjoying it sometimes
I'll just get annoyed at myself in the
video isn't the way I wanted to or I
feel like I'm not doing you guys good
enough or something like that or also
hate comments like I try not let them
get to me sometimes there's just one or
two that just kind of hit you and you're
like oh oh like I get over them and I
realize like it's one person they're
just they're saying something means they
feel better about themselves but
sometimes they will say something that
you know maybe has bothered you in the
past or like your insecurities or
something or it's just kind of like
someone else like thinks that about me
sometimes that can be a little
bothersome but when it comes to my ratio
of haters and
people leave nice comments and support
me it's like not even a complete like
I'm not even complaining like I have so
many amazing royal subscribers like I
honestly feel like I have the best
subscribers in the world I'm gonna be
honest that's probably one of the
hardest things on YouTube or just me
being a little perfectionist I just want
everything to be like perfect and really
good and I know that not everything can
be I try to try my hardest to make it so
sometimes I can just be a little much
for you you're a top master se I'm so
sorry if I butchered that he says I love
you so much I'll cry if you put this in
your video and my question is if you had
to eat one thing for the rest your life
