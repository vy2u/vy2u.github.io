today's video I wanted to jump right
into because through this whole process
you can tell by the title what happened
you can tell by my lips what happened
it's the second day I've actually like
spent my day with lip injections so
that's why I still look crazy they're
lopsided they're swollen they're purple
I just filmed an intro to this video
like 10 minutes ago I had a full face to
make a bot I had lipstick on and tried
to cover up my bruises and stuff like
that I just wanted to sit down like this
the reason why some of my makeup is gone
and I took the lipstick off to show you
guys what my lips look like I actually
cried this makeup up I'm gonna be honest
I am a softy when it comes to emotions I
care a lot I put a lot of emotion into
everything I do and when I don't like
how something turns out or something
happens I'm emotional I did get a little
emotional because I was watching the old
footage and as I was watching it I
really didn't like how my lips looked
and I started getting really down on
myself and hard on myself and then I
realized that it takes two weeks for my
lips to settle like I need a chill I
can't rush it but the reason I was
tripping about it is because it's the
feedback I don't know I just got really
overwhelmed by that because I was just
thinking all the comments are gonna be
hating on me for my lips looking wack
but it's literally only the third day
but people are just so quick to jump to
conclusions and judge your life story
and judge you as a person just wanted to
rant about this for a second because
it's been on my mind and it has to do
with the video so why not talk about it
I just really want to make it clear to
my audience and whoever's watching this
that your life is meant to be lived for
you and I didn't realize that until
recently and it really comes down to
what you want to do I want to see our
live injections and guess what I got
them it's like this just goes along with
the fact that I'm gonna own up to
getting my lip injections and I'm not
gonna say I didn't get them like a lot
of social media people and a lot of
celebrities just totally ignore the fact
that they got works body worked face
work whatever it makes the girls and
guys growing up think that the ideal
women is like that and they were born
like that and they're perfect or
whatever I think it's putting a big toll
on art just everything like scrolling
through my Instagram I barely see one
photo without facetune of making the
girls waist smaller I'm making this and
I'm just gonna let you know I'm really
really good at picking that stuff up my
eyesight is
the best part of me isn't literally I
could rant about that forever but I just
wanted to sit here and be like you're
perfect the way you are but if you want
to do something do it but own up to it
and take responsibility it's getting
really into this I get really heated at
times when I just really need a chill
I'm just a very opinionated person I
guess I really have no idea I'm a Leo
rawr there's just always been a problem
with me in my lips and I've wanted this
for a long time it's not a huge
difference I got like one syringe I got
natural I wanted to show you guys the
process of me getting them done and then
after me getting them done I love you
guys more than you can imagine to
infinity and beyond
and you know when I say it and I hope
you know that why are we here I can't I
cannot feel my life at all I can't
remember what are you doing you're
getting what lip injections done I
really can't feel my lips right now
don't have to be artsy about what did
they do to you I feel like they've
gotten bigger though just it looked
great let's leave I'm tasting drag
because she's freaking out that I'm
getting lip injections and she's not
here with me but we out here nice pants
so artsy dead look at that I really
don't have lips right fire outer yeah
that's what I definitely want to get
bigger there okay also just like on for
volume they have a pouty yeah are you
okay to be bruised a little bit a little
bit of swelling I always do follow-up
appointments um for all my patients just
because sometimes you need to do a
touch-up or sometimes it gets a little
bit up you know like you wanna mess with
you which could easily be fixed by
massage it yeah should I massage my own
no okay that's my responsibility so
don't touch them exactly may give you
something to squeeze on I'm just going
to give you four shots okay
local shots of Anastasia it doesn't hurt
that bad okay that's it okay so now like
I've done anything done and they feel
massive like massive we got two doses of
painkiller or whatever vital King should
put in my bloodstream I could have done
that wisdom teeth removal so today we're
gonna do velour Juvederm voluma and this
one lasts for a second eighteen months
Wow okay yeah you don't have any outer I
will do on you I will build the outline
first we shape it yes then I will build
volume after awesome
okay you have something to squeeze on
and then we're gonna give you some ice
so that ice and watch coming up with the
bruising and the swimming and then we'll
I see between EJ
okay so nice the right moment I'm not on
that you know when we think yellow I
love it I'm just gonna mark you first
and we start icing this site for me
do you like what I did then I mean
uh-huh you're gonna see the difference
right away
well it looks really good right now let
me just mean you I mean I'll show you
you're very narrative so happy are you
okay being on Mel Joy's channel yeah
what's up on her lips like just a little
swollen but this woman will go away the
bathroom
who are you I grew so easily to do oh my
god it looks very natural you're gonna
feel something that is normal it's gonna
go down within the next few days or so
you know in two weeks we can see yeah
you need another string dude are you
happy mm-hmm this is a little swollen
yeah good morning I'm doing a progress
report on my lips so as you saw earlier
in the vlog I got my lips done and I
don't know it was super super fast yeah
Wow
this is not what they're gonna stay like
I know a lot of people jump to
conclusions
it's crazy these days but I know getting
lip injections is something that
everyone hates about and I'm gonna talk
about this later I'm gonna do a whole
sit down video talking about why I
personally got lip injections
probably when they're more settled and
less swollen because today is the first
morning I woke up with them so it's
gonna be the worst for right now she
said it takes about like 3 to 5 days of
downtime for them to like heal and
get sworn and like get evened out and
stuff like if I show you my lips oh my
god I like you can see have a bruise
appear from but look at this bruise like
check see this sides not as bad as you
can see but you can also tell that this
side is way more swollen than this side
I got them done yesterday at 5:00 about
5:30 p.m. and now it's the next morning
9:25 so that gives you a little
perspective of how swollen like I think
it got more swollen than last night
almost or like on this side I have an
appointment in two weeks also if I don't
like them and I want to get them like
touched up or like fixed in a certain
area
I just don't know right now what's gonna
happen and I just have to wait it out
day to day this is wild to me I don't
know if the swelling is going down or if
it's kidding I'll talk to you guys later
peace I'm too overwhelmed I'll do a
close-up say have bruising up here tried
to cover it with makeup but it's pretty
much off there's a little bump up here
really bad bruising here too mostly the
bumps are here though like you can see
they're like uneven I love you guys
don't forget it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
