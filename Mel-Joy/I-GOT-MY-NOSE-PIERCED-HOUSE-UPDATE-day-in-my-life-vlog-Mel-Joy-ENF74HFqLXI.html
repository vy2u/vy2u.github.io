just did my makeup I don't know does it
I hope it looks good I really quickly
wanted to make this intro I really need
to look here like Mel just you've been
on YouTube for three years stop looking
at the viewfinder I thought I would
really quickly do what my intro before I
get started in today's vlog I'm gonna
dress the elephant in the room my nose
ring I got it oh say what it was a super
impulsive decision which is usually what
I do for everything you like big so this
happened within like a couple of hours I
was like why not gonna knows writing
like it's technically not permanent like
a tattoo I did that the other day and
then just left kind of think about that
more I got a ring because I've always
wanted a ring and I don't know like I've
always been scared but I'm really happy
I got it
I can't stop looking at it but yeah I
feel like it's part of me now and I
really I dig it like I just I don't know
if you don't like it I'm sorry and if
you do then that's what's up so many of
you guys have been asking for vlogs I
can be a really bad vlogger but I'm
trying to get a lot better
you guys really seem to love my blogs I
really like doing them too just showing
you what I do in my life it's some
genuine content do you feel me I have a
couple things on today's schedule I have
to take some photos really quickly and
then it's my dad's birthday and if you
guys know my dad is like my favorite
person like my best friend he's like
just the dopest dude you will ever meet
in your whole life and it's his birthday
so I want to do something special he
isn't one for like I bought him an iPad
for Christmas or whatever but like he
prefers not objects like a meaningful
gift I don't know so I wanted to get the
whole family reunited again because my
sister she lives a little bit away so I
offered to go pick her up for my dad's
birthday so hopefully she's not like
working or something and I was like
gonna surprise him with her and has like
a family dinner and we're gonna go to
the beach and stuff I'm really trying to
look there like guys I'm working on it I
just it's but yeah I don't know I'll
keep you posted

responds if she doesn't then I'm just
gonna go to the dentist because I have
to get a sealant filled or something
also ignore my nails
to redo them but yeah I have to go to
the dentist which will be super late so
I'll try to film at all the people in
the office there like the dentist place

the longest time so maybe they want to
be in the vlog but we'll see so yeah I'm
gonna get some work done I also want to
show you a quick update of the house but

some of the work I'm not that excited to
do because just a lot of work I'm not
trying to sound like who feels sorry for
me oh my god no it's fun I'm happy I
have stuff to do I would rather have
stuff to do than just be laying on the
floor bored as hell
it keeps me busy that's what I love
about it like I always have something to
do it's an interesting experience very
new very very different but I'm learning
so much so quick so this was a really
long intro I'm gonna go take photos and
