doing a little video about this little
thing if you guys had not heard of these
this is a Polaroid camera not from
Polaroid it's from Fujifilm and it is
the Instax 8 mini and I just have it in
white they also have pastel yellow
pastel pink and pastel blue and black
but I just like white because I think
it's really like classy and chic and
plain and I like it so today I'm going
to be doing a little review slash demo I
am obsessed with this
so this costs about $100 usually but I
got it on Amazon for 62 or 65 dollars it
ranges between the seller I think I just
got it from Amazon it might be kind of
expensive but it's so worth it I was
kind of nervous to make the purchase but
after I purchased it I'm so thankful
that I did it is such a cute idea how
have photos that come instantly and
they're physically like you can't hold
them and I just think it's such a great
way to make memories with your friends
and your family so now let's talk about
the film so I just get the 50 pack on
Amazon for $35 I think my friend did the
math that it was 67 cents a photo and I
think that's actually a better deal than
the old Polaroids because they'd be like
big squares and they'd be about a dollar
more per photo but anyways the photos
just pop out at the top and they are
this size they're rectangular not square
this is actually a credit card size
camera and this is just a food so what
happens is you put your eyes through
this oh and look I see you guys through
this right here oh can you see this is
so cool if it's your eye do this and you
see out of this and you do not actually
see out of here so when you take the
photo you're gonna be like they're here
but really things here so you have to
move it left and up to get the exact
placing of the photo that you originally
want
what happens if you press this button
right here on the side it's a thing and
it pops out the red light goes on and
makes like you're starting up noise I
mean also keeps track of how many photos
you have left right there bobbins here
is a top there are five settings
this one is house and it's the LED is on
that because I'm actually my house right
now so it just tells you through the
exposure what setting it things so you
should be on this is cloudy sunny extra
sunny and this is high key and I
actually don't know what that does I've
heard a lot of people don't know what it
does and you just turn it this way and
you can push it back in if you don't
want to take a photo and then you can
click the button nothing will happen
how you take the photo is there there's
a button right here pretty simple you
just pop it open tick and you're good to
go so in the back how you insert film i
filming you already pop it open and the
film is just in here you just line up
with the yellow you push it in you close
it and you're all good to go it just
pops right out of the top I just took a
photo right now when you open it right
here it ain't when I opened it and
change the number of photos and I forgot
about that so it's in it I'd had like
zero and I wanted to do test one as you
can see it's developing it takes 10
minutes to fully develop but you'll
start seeing the photo about after one
you know and I'll just keep getting
darker and darker it develops actually
fairly quickly but that's just that and
it'll come out something like this and
this is just some milkshakes and some
birds and some fries because that's how
we do I have a lot of photos I have had
this camera for a belt around a month
and I'm obsessed with it I really want
to get enough photos to cover my wall
like on a white wall it's like 1 2 3 you
know I'm saying I think it looks so cute
and I have a stack right here there's
about 30 photos and they're actually
pretty thick as you can tell I have
photos of me and my friends food my
friends dog so cute like a pretty sky oh
my friend had the
really cool CD shelf I thought it looked
really cool so I took a photo of it my
family my friends I have a ton of
memories I honestly think this is an
amazing way to keep memories and I just
love how they're physical and I love the
border and there is a space for you to
write on them I personally like it when
there's nothing written on it and it's
just plain white I think I'm not sure I
like it so this cannot zoom you can't
zoom in zoom out anything like that
it's a pretty simple camera it works
really really well it actually it's not
very blurry what I've noticed is it
actually gets kind of more blurry on the
cloud effect if you wanted more of like
a blurry kind of misty photo it's really
really good focusing I know that when I
took a photo close-up of some daisies
he'll show you it did not focus very
well on them but it's still really cute
I still like the way it looks it just
didn't focus super super well that's
probably because I was too close I would
definitely suggest this it comes with a
strap
oh by the way you cannot turn off the
flash the flash is always going to
happen no matter really what it's you
like cover it but I'd only think that'll
work to your benefit this is so cool I
love this I would definitely suggest it
to anybody
I had 5 stars I have not done any
problems with this I love it so much I
hope you guys enjoyed my review of them
