and today's video is going to be a faves
video except it's a kind of in-between
months I have been loving a lot of
things recently and that I wanted to
share with you guys if you're new to my
channel hi I'm Mel nice to meet you and
if you're not already subscribed I would
love it if you did so it would make my
heart really happy I post videos every
single Saturday and I'm starting to post
two days a week so stay tuned for that
Tuesdays and Saturdays
cuz it's summer so I'm just going to
show you guys some products that I've
been loving recently they're kind of
like my current faves and I think I'm
going to be using them a lot during the
summertime so this will hopefully be
helpful to you so you know let's get
started I think I'm gonna start beauty
because I love beauty so the first
Beauty favorite that I have been loving
is this concealer from Maybelline this
is the maybelline superstay better skin
concealer if you guys know I'm obsessed
with the NARS creamy concealer but like
this is a really close second to it I
feel like this is better for summer
because it's a little like less heavy
weight than the NARS concealer is and I
don't know I've just been absolutely
loving this it looks like this and I am
in the shade like 20 if you're wondering
I'm wearing it right now and I've been
wearing it in a couple of my past videos
two kinds of drugstore so it's like what
eight dollars which is you know a good
deal so if you guys are looking for new
concealer I would try this baby out so
then the second Beauty product is also a
face product it is the okay I'm so gonna
butcher this it's like lynnae's lounge I
don't know
BB cream and this thing is so cool it
looks like this and then you open it
there's like this little puff ball here
and then you open it again and that's
where the product is and I think this is
so cool and awesome packaging because
sagginess pill it's not going to go
anywhere I've been using this in my
Beauty Blender and I love it it's so
natural this is in the shade light I
love this product it's really
lightweight you feel like you're not
even wearing anything it goes on great
I'm just like super pleased with this
product and I've never
this brand before I think I might look
into my products ya know and the next
favorite I'm going to be talking about
is on the phone you guys have probably
heard of this app but it is called best
fiends I have gotten so into it guys I
don't know I've been playing it so often
if you don't know best fiends is it's
pretty much a puzzle game that you like
collect characters and like build a team
and you fight against the slug so I
partnered with best fiends to let you
guys know that there are some awesome
summer updates out at a few cool guys
you know also they're having a Father's
Day special it's like what they're
celebrating all the dads on June 19th
Father's Day so all you have to do is
log into that game and you get a free
prize so I think that's pretty cool
there's a ton of free levels and like a
special side quest based on like the
popular players honestly I'm pretty
proud of myself I'm on level 31 if you
can be me tweet me your scores
I don't know I'm proud of it but yeah it
has definitely been a favorite of mine
and this month definitely feel like
everyone just needs like a fun app for
the summer time so then my next favorite
also has to do with my phone but it's on
the outside of my phone I don't know if
you guys I've heard of these things or
not I hadn't heard of it until I gone to
LA and Jordan I was hanging out Jordan
Jones and her friends and she had one I
was like what is this and then also when
I made my collab with Collins key which
if you want to watch that you can click
right there he had one too and I was
like what are these things they seem to
be pretty popular I just didn't know
about them because I mean it's called a
pop socket so pretty much oh my god it's
so cool I have the white marble one
pretty much what it is is it pops out
and I the iPhone 6s plus so I have a big
phone and I'm kind of a small person for
like this phone like it's literally this
that's my face but this is so helpful
because I can hold it like this like I
found it take a selfie you know they're
good for selfies but they're also good I
know like I won't drop my phone if I
have things in my hand like I can have
it gripped on this you know I can even
can set it up when you want like watch
something like set it up on a table like
that I do that a lot you can also spin
it too if you feel like it I've been
totally obsessed with this thing it just
helps because I have such a big phone
and
and it's helpful I bought mine on Amazon
like ten bucks from pops socket but they
also have a website reform I customize
your own and it's really cool I like
this mob one and I might get some more
for when I'm writing other cases ya know
so then the next circuit I'm going to be
talking about is kinda like a skincare
favorite and it is from derma e and it
is this purifying daily detox scrub with
marine algae and activated charcoal see
how it's like you know black it's an
exfoliant so exploits your face and I
have been so obsessed with that because
I don't want dry skin it's just normal
to oily but I don't have super oily skin
and I still use it and it works really
great
so he's this ramen I wake up in the
morning just to kind of scrub all the
dead gross stuff off my face I don't
know like it makes your face feel so
soft
I said soft weird but I don't know I've
been loving this you're looking for a
new face scrub up on this so the next
favorite is kind of like a food
wellnot drink and random favorite first
thing is lemon water the second thing is
this cup the day I bought the cup I was
scrubbing off to like the price tag on
it or whatever you're not sticky and the
pain rubbed off so it's kind of pissed I
was like really like I just bought this
but you know I'm dealing with it I can
always hold it this way but it just has
a gold M and it's like a lilac purple I
got from North drums but it's from Kate
Spade it's like the CML is like a
Starbucks cup so you know it's just
having like a cup to bring around has
been a favorite because it's summer so
you guys stay hydrated so I've been
drinking so much water that's probably
not a favorite just water because you
know I'm putting some lemon in my water
and I've just been drinking it
throughout the day I fill this thing up
like five times a day and yeah so this
has been a favorite and it just makes me
feel refreshed and clean keeps my skin
kind of clear you know so the next
favorite is a body splash so what this
is called body mist this is from pink
Victoria's Secret and it's in Sunkist
and can we talk about I keep the name is
and also look how much I've used of this
well so we're just well so good that
it's such like a perfect summary scent
be forever some kissing coconut water
and sunny vanilla it's just it's perfect
for summer so I've been loving this I
just spray this all over me but I use
like another perfume and then I'll put
the
over it to like I don't know to have the
best of both worlds
my next favorite were you at our shoes
so these are these Adidas sneakers a lot
of you guys have been asking me where I
got these and like what style they are
so I got these at like an outlet like a
like a but where Footwear out it what's
good these are from neo a datas neo
cloud phone I think if you look up like
black adidas me out there leather for
like probably pleather they like look
like leather and they're just black and
half white straps and I think they look
so sick I love them and they're really
cute yeah I'm my knees a lot and I love
adidas I do this it's one of my favorite
brands so yeah and since I got them at
the I love they're like super cheap
which was also you know cool so then the
next kind of fashion really good thing
and also the last thing I'm going to be
talking about today are graphic tees and
guys I kind of have a problem recently I
have been shopping kind of a lot of
hauls coming soon don't worry but I got
a lot of graphic tees there's also just
one thank you but I have been so
obsessed with graphic tees here's one
