going to prom they grow up so fast and
I'm so excited
Wow okay hey guys it's me Amell so
today's video is going to be a first
impression of the Kylie Jenner lip kit I
got two colors I got candy K and Dolce K
I was so surprised I actually got them I
was sitting it's kind of bad in class um
I'd like ten minutes left of school so
you know it wasn't a big deal you know
school is important I know of something
like I got a tweet and I was like no no
like I know so I went on the website I
was like entering all my information
really hectically
cuz we had worked at macaws so you know
it wasn't like it was in the middle of a
lecture or anything and then my order
went through and I was like no way it's
actually really funny cuz I was like
rushing so hard enough putting in mell
joy I wrote like mal joy to Gigi but you
know I got it so I asked you guys on my
snapchat if you guys wanted to see this
video because I posted that I got it on
snapchat and a lot of you guys
screenshot in it so you guys definitely
want to see it and if you don't follow
me on my snapchat it's me myself and Mel
with two L's you can definitely do that
it'll be right here I have been posting
on my story like crazy especially
because guys I got a new phone so my
microphone is fixed they like bless up
yes it's a plus two so I just have so
much more fun with it because it's so
much bigger and I don't know yeah so if
you guys want to add me on that you can
anyway so I'm going to do a first
impression of this I'm really just you
know we're jumping in this video so
first off the packaging is so adorable
I'm not going to show you the front you
know because safety reasons as little
like black slime drops very cute and if
you don't know how much these kits are
they're 29 for each kit it comes with a
lip liner
a matte lipstick nice packaging
protecting the product and then the
first thing you see when you open it it
looks like this it's so cute has this
cute little like letter she writes to
Philip kids the lift kids absolutely
love the packaging on these I think it's
adorable and then just more padding you
know so your lip kids are gonna be safe
on their journey to your house so I just
got to I got candy K and Dolce hey
that's so excited I don't know what you
want to start with first so we're just
gonna do eeny meeny miny moe eeny meeny
miny moe all right we're struggling with
Dolce K I have not used these or
anything I got these in the mail
yesterday and I'm gonna be honest I was
really tempted to just put them on right
away but I didn't I waited Kylie's tips
on the back our line looks with a
blender and filling with liquid lip
filler that's what we're gonna do today
so the liner looks like this it's really
nice packaging and the actual liquid
lipstick looks like this my goodness I'm
so excited
so I'm noting on my lips right now and
I'm pretty much just going to line them
and then fill it in and we're just gonna
see my reaction to doing this let's do
it okay right off the bat it's really
creamy Wow
so I have my lip slide now I'm going to
fill it in okay wow this smells like
vanilla cupcakes yeah the applicator is
just like a doe foot applicator I think
that's what it's called and I'm just
gonna play it it's applying on really
smoothly so far you kind of just have to
like wait till it turns matte I guess Oh
Dolce is definitely like kinda like a
mocha brown I don't know if you know
that's good terminology for that at all
it's not sticky at all heck when I rub
my lips together mmm it's super matte
which I love I'm sorry I'm looking into
this
I'm just gonna hold it um sorry if I
keep looking at the finder I'm just
trying to like see what it looks like I
like this color
this is definitely a nice brown color
I've been looking for a nice brown color
this is what it looks like let's see
what looks like on camera I don't know
it's not like a test it looks pretty
good on camera too I definitely think if
I had a huge lips it would look pretty
good as well but I don't but you know
put us-born win what else do I say about
it it's like so like soft like that's
what I think is really cool I think
overall it's worth the money because you
get two products so it's like fifteen
dollars a thing pretty much actually a
lot of drugstores on lipstick will be
like you know ten dollars so this isn't
even like that much more expensive but
you just have to buy like the kit like
together I really like it I think it's
really good quality I don't know how
long it lasts I'm gonna prom candy K now
and then I'm gonna leave that on and
then I'm gonna tell you guys how long it
lasts so far we're at yes ten out of ten
would recommend I'm just gonna get a
little closer up there yet this is with
color so now ready to go put on candy K
I'm back and I took off Dolce K it
wasn't like too hard to remove I just
like lipstick remover from NYX so it
wasn't that bad but I also noticed when
I put that on it it looked really pretty
with like a gloss on it too so maybe you
know morning candy cake oh okay
we lost kitty I lose things so easily
guys I'm really excited for Kandy K
because I've been looking for like this
perfect nudey pink color for so long and
when she came out with it I was like yes
Kylie thank you I have tried by so many
dupes for this color so now I'm just
excited to you know try it out it you
know
lips and this color seems like kind of
close to Dolce K but just a little more
pinky like I knew that when I was buying
it I just loved both colors I just you
know the drying part is the part that
scares me don't want to mess it up and
I'll - just not rubbing it because sorry
I can't talk it like kind of messes up
the middle of it which I noticed maybe
it's just me
Sunny's gonna wait for it to dry another
tip don't put too many coats on because
it starts to kind of look like pili
which is what I just did oops so don't
like pile it on and put too many coats
because then it starts looking like
there's different layers on your lips
because there are because you put
multiple coats alright but it's dry now
I think it looks a little darker than I
expected it to look but it's definitely
more pink tone than Dolce K I still
think it looks really pretty
maybe I just put too much on could
definitely be me I'm gonna get closer so
you can see it this is candy cake here
let me compare ljk and candy cake
together so wow they're really similar
which one is which this one is candy K
and this one is Dolce K next to each
other it's like this they're pretty
similar
I think the consistency is super nice
I'm expecting it to last for a pretty
long time just cuz I feel like it would
I don't know just by the way it's
sitting on my lips I'm gonna check in
with you guys
a little later it's quite a while later
that's why it looks a lot darker the
liquid lipstick stayed on for a really
long time
I think it's been four or five hours I'm
about to eat something so I thought I'd
film this before I don't know if eating
is gonna mess it up but just in case it
did I don't know I just wanted to let
you guys know how long it lasted it
didn't like run or anything it's looking
pretty good
if anything it might like stead into my
lips a little more maybe that's because
I put a little too much on I'm gonna be
honest but I am really pleased with this
product of how long it lasts it's a
little bit more sticky than it was when
I first applied it like it wasn't sticky
at all not even to like complain
sticking it
so I would definitely recommend this I
like it a lot so yeah this is my little
update after a couple hours thank you
guys so much for watching this video I
hope this helped you guys in any shape
no that's not that I hope this helped
you guys in any way shape or form
I really like the colors I'm happy I got
these ones I'm satisfied
you know ya know I would probably rate
this product like at eight or nine out
of ten I think
thank you guys so much for watching this
video I love you guys to infinity and
beyond and I hope you're having a
marvelous morning afternoon or night and
I will see you guys in my next video bye
