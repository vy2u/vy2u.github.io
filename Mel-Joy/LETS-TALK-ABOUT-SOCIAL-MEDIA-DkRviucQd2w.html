am digging this up okay today's video is
gonna be super chill super lacks no big
studio lights or anything like that just
because I don't know I wanted to keep it
like super real
super chill I want to start a new
segment on my channel called let's talk
about blank in each video I'll be
talking about a different subject and
like only one subject I'm pretty much
just gonna answer you guys questions
that I get through Twitter probably
that's what I used this time today's
video for instance is gonna be a social
media video just a video all about my
thoughts on social media my opinions and
make sure to comment any other topics
you would want to see it for this
segment if we're feeling it I hope we're
feeling it let me know if we're feeling
it but like boys anxiety school growing
up I don't know I've learned a lot the
past couple of years I feel like and I
just want to share my knowledge so
that's what we're doing and if you're
new to my channel what is up my name is
Mel it is great to meet you and I would
really appreciate it if you would
subscribe I have faith you know the
button is and I just want to like it
lacks real quick and make sure to click
the little notification Bell button if
you want to be notified for every time I
post a video you know the drill I feel
like I don't have to say in every video
but I'm honestly super excited to do
this video because I have been watching
YouTube and like I've been on social
media since I was in 9 years old
but I only started making videos and
actually you know growing a following on
social media until I was no I say 15 14
15 wow I was a young I was a young in
but pretty much I lived the life of like
a follower and like a fangirl and
someone who really looked up to people
and things like that and then I also got
to live this life which is like the
complete opposite and people watching
your videos and giving you feedback and
so I've been on both sides of the
spectrum so I thought it was time I just
I make a video it sounds so much to say
this is not gonna be a tea filled video
I'm not gonna be spilling any tea any
drama exposing people and nothing like
that because I'm not about that
I'm not about
putting down other people and things
like that not my business I'm not gonna
make it my business no drama
that's not my forte I'm not into it
leave me out of it I just think it's
made a huge difference on our society in
our generation and just how we grow up
this isn't gonna be like a negative
video anything like that I always try to
stay positive and the point of this
video is like social media can just
really make something seem a lot
different than it actually is anyway so
let's just get started before I start my
own rant because that will happen I
screenshotted so many of your guys's
questions because y'all just had some
really good questions I'm gonna be
honest do you find social media toxic
sometimes and I'm not gonna expand why I
think this but yes I do think it can be
toxic sometimes and I'll explain later
but honestly yes what's it like being so
influential to so many people I love you
and I love you too this is a good
question I could talk about this forever
because being an influencer is like kind
of my whole life you know what I mean
are like a really big part of it just
like kind of made me who I am like put
me where I am in life everything like
that I'm gonna be honest it can be a lot
of pressure it can be too much pressure
at some times because like I get
feedback for everything that I put out
to people so I don't want to like mess
up and say something wrong that I didn't
mean or do this so it can be hard
because if people look up to me like I
don't want to stop and you know like
make people look at me differently but
I'm still 18 and I'm still figuring life
out and like life is confusing as hell
and I'm getting a better grip at it does
that even we're gonna say that makes
sense and it's hard because I'm still
trying to figure it out myself and I'm
you know portraying to people what my
daily life is and if it's the wrong
daily life I'll get criticized does that
make sense and like I don't really care
about the criticism and the hate anymore
I've realized like I'm gonna live my
life and whoever supports me will
support me and that means the world you
know I'm gonna be a hundred percent me
till the end because I'm not trying to
live my life as anyone else but it can
be hard I'm gonna be honest being
influential to so many people but it's
an amazing opportunity as well I hate
disappointing people and I hate not
pleasing people so it's hard because I
can't please
everyone on the internet and everything
so I just I had to get over myself
and I did about it so we're about to get
into a topic that I could talk about for
a very long time it's just one of those
things that just just makes me mad
it urges me urge us I need to like get a
dictionary and you look at it do you
think social media creates a false image
of beauty Wow girl I wonder said like
yes there's no part of me that's like
saying no right now like yeah it's so
crazy I don't know what happened to
social media but like all these
standards somehow popped up that
everyone had to like live up to and I
was like since when did this happen
it was you know the small waist the big
butts whatever and like can be done
surgically or whatever and no one could
like fake that on Instagram I can fake
that on whatever unless they actually
had it done and things like that but now
there's this app called face - I know a
lot of people are like face suits but
srib like face soon if you're watching
this delete your app delete your app I
understand the small things on face -
and you know if you have a pimple and
it's really bothering you and you just
want to smooth it out like whatever but
it's a different story when the unedited
photo and the after edited photo are
unrecognizable like I I've seen some
before-and-after photos and they don't
even look like the same person and like
I'll be honest I have got off face soon
and done everything you know the things
that are really into like make you look
prettier on face - you know whitening
the eyes whitening your irises you know
making your nose smaller making your
eyes bigger and more like angle that the
way you like like your eyebrows
everything is like we can now create
whatever we want to look like with this
app I've done some crazy stuff on this
app and yeah like I looked hot as hell
but I'm not gonna go post that because I
don't look like that that is not me like
it's just I could also the body thing
when people like it's not normal to have
a waist this small boobs this big an ass
this big and now kids are growing up
looking at social media seeing all these
girls with these figures that are like
humanly impossible to have unless you
have face tuned or you've had surgical
whatever I don't know it's it makes me
sad because I see how
time little kids spend on social media
you know and I have subscribers coming
up to me that are 810 years old and I'm
like you're so young the environment you
grow up in is what's gonna affect your
personality like your daily life
everything and anyone can have social
media right little nine-year-old Mel
would be shocked to see these bodies you
know and I know that me growing up at
that point I'd be like why don't I look
like them when I'd be trying to work out
so much you do whenever like I can just
visualize little Mel you know seeing
this and growing up with it and like I
don't want anyone to feel like that
because it's fake I'm sorry I'm getting
very into this but not everything you
see is what it really is some people in
social media have like worked their
asses off for their body kudos to that's
amazing that's not what I'm talking
about I'm talking about face to face
team face I don't know bro just
everything in moderation and like I
understand face to and can be used for
some you know beneficial things or like
red eye or whatever I'm sorry that was
such a long rant and I will talk about
other things that I just touched base on
but yes I do think social media creates
a very much so false image of beauty and
it makes me really sad how does social
media make most young people feel or how
does it influence our lives so that's
what I just touched base on and the
other question but I just want to talk
about it for a second because social
media influences us I feel like so much
or maybe not everyone but there's like a
good amount of people using social media
there's a train there's a lot of people
using social media every day every
second of every day I just don't know
what our world would be like right now
without social media because I feel like
it's such a big part of us you know like
someone forgets their phone it's like we
got to go back and get that phone I
think it's really influential and
especially on younger people that's just
like I worry I genuinely want to start
like a campaign or something to raise
awareness for little girls and guys
growing up that like you don't have to
look how everyone looks on the Internet
you know to be beautiful in whatever
it's just I think about it a lot I'm
gonna be honest and that it's hard
because social media is my job you know
and it's like my passion and it gets
hard a lot because there's things that I
wish I could fix about it and whatever
and not for my benefit
know what's going on with social media I
feel like I've mastered social media and
when I see something I kind of know what
the person is trying to do her this like
it's like almost my daily life in that
sound sack say but like YouTube
Instagram you know that's just like I
kind of lived through it in a way you
know and it breaks my heart to think
about little girls who are 13 that
looked like they're 19 like what
happened to childhood ISM like I said I
made that word up like whatever what
happened to it broke what happened to
how do you stay out of drama on social
media I think drama can be made from the
smallest little thing I was involved in
drama recently literally from someone
asking me to check their DMS because
they asked to collab I think a lot of
people Fein off drama these days and
they like liked it and it's interesting
and it's something going on I'm just not
into drama I'm not a fan of drama I will
never be a fan of drama middle school
mount was I loved drama back then and
now I hate it and I never want to be a
part of it it's just gross and it's not
worth my time but I shut it down like I
should have done real quick if drama
even pops up I used to be the person
that sat in silence I didn't want to
piss anyone off I didn't want to you
know do anything to disturb anything if
I hear something and I know what's wrong
and I don't agree with it not happening
I'm shutting it down I'll text the
person who started it I'll tweet the
person who started it I will do whatever
but I just don't want unless I did
something really stupid
and caused myself drama then like that's
on me I got it oh not for my mistakes
but if there's other drama going on like
I'm just I'm gonna be straight up about
it be straight up don't let it happen
why I'm even going on in your life shut
it down how do you not compare yourself
to people on social media and I talked
about this how you know you can't even
look like some of the people on social
media it's like not humanly possible
physically possible for me when I scroll
through my feet I'll be like oh this
person is gorgeous but like I don't need
to look like that and I don't look like
that I'm me I'm my own person it's all
about your own self just do not believe
everything you see on the internet it's
crazy and people can do whatever they
want to themselves and whatever but when
you're affecting people on a daily basis
like you got to own up to it but you
can't look at that as like I have to
look like that I need to compare to that
because it's their life you don't even
know what's going on in their life what
editing went into that
maybe there's no editing but you can't
judge social media on everyday life you
go out into the real world and you see
people you know of all shapes and sizes
all different looking people and I love
that do not compare yourselves to anyone
on social media in life even don't
compare yourself to anyone like nobody
when you wake up in the morning is the
first thing you do check your social
media it used to be the first thing I
did every morning I would go on my phone
check Twitter Instagram snapchat I would
watch stories I would watch everything
and then I realized that was not a good
way of starting my day and my piece of
advice to you would be to not start your
day by looking at your phone and going
on social media I like to start my day
with music I'll just play music right
when I wake up I'll just lay in bed and
I'll think about what I want to do with
my day what mindset I want to be in just
what I want to get done I want to get in
a boss mindset you know and I don't want
to sit there and wake up and look at
everyone else's lives and what they're
doing and compare myself to that it's
like why wake up and live your own life
don't wake up and check in on what
everyone else is doing you know you have
to focus on you first and especially
right when you wake up it wasn't the
right way to start my day when I used to
do that and I think it really affected
me as a person and just how I saw my
life you know and now I see my life in a
completely different way do you feel
that they ruin our generation or that
they make people feel closer and that's
a really good question because I think
social media can really go both ways if
you know what I mean in a way I think it
makes us closer because we can talk to
people all around the world whoever we
want whenever we want you know make new
friends do whatever even meet spouses
like crazy things like that but I also
think social media is ruining our
generation a little bit not ruining but
just impacting us negatively I guess
when I was on YouTube in my first couple
years I felt like it was a community
everyone was together everyone was
talking everyone was this I just think
there's now more like hierarchy in our
generation if that makes sense like if
you have more followers you're cooler or
you have more social points like things
like that and I don't like it what's the
biggest change you've seen on social
media since you first started I would
personally say the negativity almost and
like the drama wanting and the like
things like that I feel like there
so much more drama and there's so much
more on my feed that's like this person
did this and I'm calling this person out
and this person is doing this but you
know everything grows everything turns
into like evolved stuff and I guess
that's how social media evolved but it's
definitely a really big change I've seen
just the full drama factor it's like
Photoshop face tune factor all that
stuff do you believe that social media
influencers should bond with their
followers love you and I love you too
and yes when I saw this question I was
like isn't that like a given like of
course you're supposed to bond with your
followers and then I realized that
nowadays it's not a given some people
don't even acknowledge their fans and
subscribers and followers
I think it's wild I just think it's wild
I mean the biggest thing for me has
always been to stay true to you guys and
talk to you guys and tweet you guys and
make sure that you guys feel loved by me
do you know what I mean and not everyone
is about that life but yeah I think
every social-media influencer should be
bonding with their followers and stuff
and if you're not like what are you
doing keeping up with social media it
can be tough sometimes how do you deal
with it love you Mel and I love you too
for me social media is interesting
because if I go like weeks without
posting on Instagram and Twitter and
things like that like people just don't
think I'm like a person anymore like I
have an online presence and if I'm not
there like people question and things
like that so sometimes I'll feel
pressure to like keep you guys updated
even though nothing's like happening in
my life sometimes I live a really boring
life I'm gonna be honest I just stay in
and I do homework and I edit my videos
and I don't do anything and sometimes I
have really awesome days and I go out
and I do stuff and sometimes I'll try to
vlog and then it won't really work out
and I'll feel like bad and then I just
realized that like I have to live my
life and if there's times where I can
plug it and I can snapchat and do things
like that that I will but I'm not gonna
force my life to be a different life
just to keep you guys updated if that
makes sense if I ever slack on posts and
stuff it's not because like I don't want
to talk to you guys I might have no
photos or like no tweet ideas to put out
there you know how do you not wish to be
the people you see portrayed on social
media and accept your unique xxx I
actually think I went through a time
where I tried to be the average social
media person I realized that that life
really sucks it's just too much pressure
to like be someone that you wants I'm
gonna see you as and stuff and I
realized that like my best quality is
being myself and why not share that with
the world instead of trying to be the
person everyone is trying to be you know
be unique be different be weird that's
what I find special in someone and
that's what I like in people and like
originality is so key and it's hard
these days because you might be copying
someone without even knowing it but I
just realized that I'm gonna wear what I
want I'm gonna do what I want I'm gonna
whatever and you're real ones will
support you and just stop trying to be
someone you're not
if you are because you're amazing the
way you are not to sound cheesy but
honestly being original and being dope
and like I like wish I could have a
super cool different crazy feed but like
I don't live a life like that
you always feel like I'm trying to find
a balance of like my style and what I
like to post and things like that and I
don't know just do whatever you feel
like doing being weird is just so much
better than being boring like come on
and you know you love it you know you
love this so what I say to my friends
and they're like you're weird I'm like
come on you know you love it you know
you love it I've been filming for so
long and so many questions we're just
we're gonna be comfortable but I'm gonna
answer more don't you worry okay so
seeing models every day on Instagram or
Twitter etc have an effect on your
self-confidence or is that just me love
you Mel and I love you too girl and
you're not alone see photos of people
and I'm just like how do they look like
that like how is that a thing there's
like some jealousy there and then I
realized it like I don't have their gene
pool or I don't have the surgery they
had or like whatever relates to that
photo and I just move on standards
really suck bro like they really suck I
feel like I'm just really repetitive in
this video but that's their life it's
not your life and literally everything
and live the life you want what's the
biggest lesson you've learned about
social media since becoming an
influencer I would definitely say I
learned not to take life as seriously as
I was and to have fun with what I'm
doing to be me and only me and nothing
else where would I want do it I want
like things like that everything that
matters the most is what's in your head
compared to other people's heads if that
makes sense and I always focus so much
on other people's thoughts of me and
other people's opinions and this and
this and like that like what's going on
in your head
that's what matters take care of
yourself put yourself first I gotta
answer this I don't know if I should but
I'm still going to what is it like
behind the scenes when being a
social-media influencer and I just want
to talk about this really quickly I'm
not gonna like go deep in and expose
people and whatever not about it you
already know that it's weird to me
because I was on the other side of it
for so long and then when I went to this
side
social media progressed and I grew up
and stuff and I'm not trying to make
social media sound terrible in this
video like social media is awesome in
its own way and negative in its own way
but there's just a lot that I never
realized with social media and now I
have realized it I feel a lot more wise
and a lot more like just about what's
going on that doesn't mean I agree with
what goes on behind the scenes have you
ever taken a social media cleanse if so
what are the benefits I want to talk
about this because I think social media
cleanses are something that we don't
bring a lot of attention to but they're
actually so important like even spending
a day off your phone dude like it'll
make a difference when you're not on
social media it just really lets you
figure out who you are and what you need
to do and how do you want to live your
life and things like that you're not
living your life and your day through
someone else's day in their life you
know what I mean you're not going on
Instagram and seeing all these people
and what they're doing and watching
snapchat stories and what people are
doing at that exact second like it's
crazy that like we're always so caught
up with what other people are doing I
think it just has a huge impact on
people and some people don't even
realize it you know I feel like when I
mean on social media as much I really
live in the moment and I live in my
moment in my life I love social media so
I'm not gonna like you know cut it out
of my life and I feel like that would be
almost like empty without social media
in a weird way not empty but like it's a
big part of me it's a big part of my
life you guys everything like that but I
think it's important for everyone to put
their phone down and even just delete
your apps for a couple days go on a hike
hang out with your friends do whatever
like see the world like sometimes I just
get too caught up in social media and my
whole youtube life where I just go on
drives and I'll put my phone down I
won't go on my phone for a while just
because I need to realize that life
isn't completely lived through social
media that's just a little ray
I think social media cleanses are so
important and very underrated so yeah
I've been filming for a very long time I
probably have so much footage but I hope
that helped you guys in some way there
are a lot of pros and cons to social
media but in the end like I love it it's
a huge part of my life and I'm gonna go
about living through social media how I
want to you know staying true to who I
am and I just hope you do that too no
hate no shade no tea I know I spend so
much time on social media so I'm not
trying to sound like a hypocrite and
being like social media so it's whatever
I'm not saying that that's not what I'm
saying there's just some things I don't
necessarily agree with but remember that
social media is learn our whole lives
you know we don't have to be on
Instagram and snapchat and Twitter
constantly to like feel like we're
actually a part of our world you know I
hope this was helpful in some sort of
way to you guys and let me know any
other videos down below you want to see
an especially leaf topic ideas down
below for this new segment that I'm
doing I'm excited about it I love you
guys to infinity and beyond I mean it
when I say it and I hope you know that I
really do and I hope you're having a
marvelous morning afternoon or night and
I will hopefully see your beautiful face
