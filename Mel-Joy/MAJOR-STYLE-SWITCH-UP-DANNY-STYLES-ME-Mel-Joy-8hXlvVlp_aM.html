today I have a special guest
what's your name so I am Danny from PAQ
Phe official Instagram Danny wellness is
my personal one I am here to style mail
in one of my favorite shops in Ella's is
most suits my style and we thought we
saw a bit different if I got melted
dress in my style traditional English
here we are I'm excited we have very
different styles but he's gonna dress me
and I'm gonna see how I like it and if I
like it I'm gonna buy the outfit it's
not right that was mercy in this as well
this is all my choice it's all him like
he is in complete control he chooses my
outfit I put it on and also make sure to
check out the video we did on Kyra TV on
paq and we went through shopping with
some other influencers and it was like a
challenge of who could buy like the best
it was almost like a couple outfit like
trying to match in some way or whatever
but anyways check it out down below it
was a lot of fun and see if we won or if
we laugh without further ado let's get
started
start off very polar iconic classic
black and yellow that's a staple
everyone must earn a black in yellow
Fred Perry the black and champagne is
ideal but black and yellow is the next
best thing
I'll try and pull you out a few outfits
and then we could see what you think for
sure while you do that I'm a shot for
myself cool essential usually wear black
though yeah Fred Perry is a classic
fresh brand I'm obsessed
Mel will be eventually no mine's also
there if you come to England you'll see
people in Fred Perry shirts from Mikey's
impulse to like style icons the supply
is unavoidable so I myself I'm a big
collector I have tons of Fred stuff
pretty much three cause my wardrobe is
Fred Perry and I feel like you can get
any style Fred will do something in it
but it's men like mod influenced like
skinheads to fine art traditional like
British subcultures so it's really it's
cool for my style I think I look really
good in it definitely walk around with
this like
it's like so restricting how's your
outfit going Danny struggling I ain't
gonna lie boom that is my eight or a six
Presley please this is six sweet thank
you very much I'm kidding
keep looking so with these this one is
the white ice in maroon so originally
Fred Perry never used to do the twin
sipping and silly but one of the buyers
for lillywhites run into a group of
football supporters who supplied West
Ham United these are their colors so
then these were the first color to be
produced as the first of a twin set from
fight fear and the dress are just cool
as well get must try that on
oh man these are sick well just sling
this on a second kids so with the flight
jackets they're orange on the inside cuz
they look for pilots and if your
aircraft down and you look like on a
Martha Stewart inside out it's easy to
get spoiled usually I go blue gingham
but that's what we want we've got
you literally take two different photos
one side with this one side with this
would be two different outfit what size
shoe yeah seven seven and us seven
so I've tried to stay quite traditional
we have a mod outfit we have lightly the
Fred Perry polo the dress thrown on a
parker over the top one outfit saw it so
we have the skinhead we have like the
gingham shirt the braces took a bomber
over the top that one sorted there's two
kind of contemporary kind of styles for
me I like the Bela fraud stuff the Bela
frost up is like just a really light
playing jumper but print on the front
and then throw like a an Amy Winehouse
Herrington over that's that look pretty
sick that's one of my personal favorites
and finally I saw male head around the
track jacket
Goering the track jacket see what she
thinks I have a big sucker for track
jackets out of all 15 of them so all in
different colors you'll buy one you'll
get addicted you'll end up with so many
because you can wear them all the time
get once much every else why not
so everything fits all the top so we
have a little little tennis dress going
on yeah feel like I'm about to go play
tennis the jackets lately no bad the
dress I'm gonna be honest I would never
wear this well yeah I'll be was good
it's just it's not you know like I
literally feel you I'm just gonna go
play tennis I mean basically overall I
wouldn't wear this but as soon as he
looks good thank you
it's not my style but I don't think it's
like that you know like I wouldn't wear
it but sweet nope on the next one
very braces wear your jeans with it as
well first one down don't think Mel was
as much of a fun as a thought but now
this looks cute like about half of you
guys think that she looked really good
in that it was flattering and I was
worried about the size but the sizes are
outta the park isn't meant to be
oversize when traditionally when mods
were on the scooters these two wear
suits so the park is started off as you
get them from my old military shops to
get a massive particle as big as you
could go start and a bitty protects your
suit from like modern oil 3 fasten it
it's all like method in it it's really
it's a sick thing to get into if you
haven't checked it out check it out so
with the skinhead look at Mel's of bolts
come out in personally do it where too
much skin it's tough my cell but it kind
of really
good on girls usually if closed in the
name you have a skinhead you shave all
your hair off fortunately for male I'm
not gonna make you do that if you want
to go the full power let's get into it
Doc Martin boots and then yeah you'd
have like your blue Levi's on you have a
ding I'm sure so a bomber over the top
hair braces let's go how do you feel
about not like myself yes it's great
yeah then he knows what's up that's it
you wearing this ever yeah my jeans the
jeans do go without the zips it's always
like light blue Levi's alright cool up -
ahh - everything fits everything looks
really good as well don't think nothing
Mel's into it so the next two outfits
are a lot more relaxed like this is kind
of stuff that I'd wear you don't really
get too many die-hard skinheads which is
that like the style that we just saw you
don't really get too many die-hard mots
anymore so you will still get girls in
like the the Fred polos through a park
or the top but not so much anymore but
yeah the next two we're gonna be a lot
more a lot more chilled out and so we
could wear every day that's really nice
anyway I might be a little bit biased
but it's not I don't think I've ever
worn like a sweater what is this a it
almost yes mid polo I feel like very
preppy like that oh you'd fit right in
like a hundred club in London and they
try jacket zipper all the way to the top
always all the way what do you think
I will convert I will be good next time
so Mel doesn't really like anything for
a self if she was just like a model
almost so it wasn't you don't have to
wear it out and go do a normal stuff if
I just have like all this spread stove
yeah it definitely suits mouth I took it
all on Mel and be like yeah this is
campaign sir me personally I'm not just
dressing it was like fancy dress this is
actually hard people do dress does feel
like fun just a little bit because I've
actually gone that but no this is proper
skin and proper mod and then like a more
contemporary things I love that cable
mate on Mel I thought that was really
cool personal taste isn't it
the last outfit is something more
similar to what West is just like a
jumper I always British on the jumper I
wasn't here as you saw this is my
favorite Bella Freud piece was the
English boy it just literally said
English boy in similar writing so this
is whistles gonna get is the old Bella
frog and it's lovers paired it with the
Harrington yeah the Harringtons sick
it's not see Amy Winehouse Harrington as
well
you know I'm you know Bob I like the
jacket it's not bad I don't know how I
feel about the hearts I like the jacket
but I just don't wear sweaters and it's
long
I'm excited to see what my fans yes
comment down below what you guys think
about that fits your favorite one was if
you have one and do you think I can pull
it off seven anything that you did like
in that all trees doing still yeah
