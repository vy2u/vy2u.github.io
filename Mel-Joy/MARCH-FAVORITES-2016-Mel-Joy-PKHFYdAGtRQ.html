brother though I lose things it's all
good yeah like what we went for a darker
vibe today oh hey guys it's me Malus so
today's video it's going to be a March
favorites video as you think for a
second because this year is going by so
fast today I'm going to be showing you
guys what I loved during the month of
March you guys requested monthly
favorites I haven't done a lot of them
but you guys seem to really like them
and you keep telling me to do that so
I'm here with that my intros are usually
way too long so they're not further ado
let's get started
the first thing I always have fun apps
we got my telephone oh here a couple
apps I have been loving recently all on
my phone first app that I've been loving
probably been one of my favorite social
media apps this month has been Twitter
if you guys want to follow me on that
you should it's Mel underscore joy three
wise I tweet things that are happening
in my life I tweet my thoughts whether
they be happier but not happy thoughts
and I think this is the easiest way for
me to be able to talk to you guys so I
always try to like respond to your
tweets message you guys back and follow
you all on there so you guys don't
follow me on twitter w ID JK but you
should probably there so that's probably
been my first app favorite my second app
favorite okay I don't know if you guys
know this about me but I am NOT a big
gamer like I don't play a lot of games
on my phone but there has been one I
just really like this one this one is
called best things this is what it looks
like right here click it I already had
mine open it's honestly guys is so much
fun I have been loving this app though I
teamed up with with best fiends to show
you guys at this app because I'm having
a lot of fun with it
so I'm just gonna show you guys how it
works really quickly it's pretty simple
but it's like fun simple and it's
because the levels are short so if you
just want something to do like in a
short period of time this will take up
the perfect amount of time but here is
level 10 I'm passable 10 no big deal
let's go show you guys how it works it
looks like this what you do well this
one is a harder level because there's
like what in it find like three of a
kind or more so here I go like that that
and that and then it'll just shoot up
and go against this bad guy here and
then you just collect characters a guy's
temper Howie and Quincy Quincy is
actually like really cute look at Quincy
Quincy
I like Quincy I like Quincy a lot
there's just so many different levels
that you can do this is the map and then
you complete levels these are levels
that I've completed and the world goes
for so long I'm gonna get that actually
if you guys have this app let me know
what level you're on down below I'm one
level 11 I think that I can pass it
quickly so we'll see you try to catch up
to me if you haven't this is definitely
been a favorite for me you'll make sure
to click the link below click click
click the link below if you guys want to
download the app or download on Google
Play and play with me it's free so you
guys don't have to pay any money or
anything
those have probably been my two favorite
apps of this month so going into I'm
gonna start with one about the beauty
the first beauty product I have been
laughs Bing is this NARS concealer
focusing okay and this is the radiant
creamy concealer and I have it in
vanilla liked to because I'm pale but I
put this under my eyes and this covers
up all my under-eye bags I also like to
put it here and it's like also a good
highlight but also normal sealer so I've
been loving loving loving this and then
the perfect combo guys is that concealer
with this powder this is the Laura
Mercier powder in translucent the loose
setting powder I just have the smaller
one of it because this stuff last you a
really long time but this is awesome and
makes your skin feel silky
smooth it's not cakey I don't know I've
just been obsessed with these two things
together on your face it's just like ten
out of ten would recommend I bake this
under my eyes all the concealer and then
I'll just apply it to the rest of my
face and I'll bake it here in here to
your honor it's on my face right here
and the next favorite which I probably
should have done before because it makes
sense to do this before but it is a
moisturizer I feel talked about this one
of my videos before but I'm not sure my
friend who does water polo and is in a
pool for like six hours a week showed me
this Garnier moisture rescue refreshing
gel cream this is for dry skin I am
doing the swim unit in school right now
in PE it's it's a lot of fun I have been
using this to keep my face moisturized
because chlorine that reddish not so
much so I've been struggling with a
little bit of dry skin in the month of
March but this helps me not have dry
skin it is my second container and it
just looks like this it's like a gel
consistency this works so well guys I
would recommend this and then my next
beauty skincare favorites is this mask
this is the derma e purifying two-in-one
charcoal mask and this stuff is so cool
because what you do this is just like
the mini one you just apply your face if
you guys follow me on snapchat then you
probably seen this and my Sunshine's me
myself and males who else if you don't
know you just apply this to your face
wherever you know you want I just do it
all over my face and it's for normal to
oily skin cuz I can have oily skin too
it's weird I I think I have combination
skin because I like dry patches and then
I'll get oily in other places and I was
like you just apply this on your face
and you leave it there for like five
minutes I can do it a little longer just
because I forget about it it hasn't done
anything bad to my face and then once
you're done you just get like your
fingertips wet and you massage it in and
there's like little charcoal bead
thingies about there's something in it
that exfoliates your face so you just
rub it in afterwards and then you wash
it off and then your face feels so shop
the next day literally I went to school
guys feel my face because it was so soft
I've been loving this to make my face
feel nice and soft this with like a
bubble bath and music and tumblr and
candles
my goodness I have two products we're
here care go Mel the first one is this
new me argan oil you're just supposed to
use it when your hair is damp or dry
I'll use it after I got a shower but my
hair stand like I'll wait a little bit
and this makes your hair smell super
good and super soft and like shiny and a
good way not a bad way we're tech oily
I've been using this a lot throughout
March and I've been growing to love it a
lot and I don't think I'm gonna stop
using it so the second hair product our
product is Marc Anthony clear at dry
shampoo and this is a mini one at
anybody mini ones but it's so I was
about to say cute no it's so nice when
my hair is feeling a lot oily and gross
I don't have time to take shower or
whatever I just spritz some into my hair
and it's clear that's what I really like
about it no white residue it even says
so right there
Belle's kind of like fresh you know it
doesn't have like a gross scent or
anything and I've almost used all of it
I should probably get a big one because
I really like this I have other dry
shampoos that I should also try
I didn't experiment more I guess I'll do
food because I love food the first thing
what's like food / not food I don't know
object is this Starbucks cup it's also
the thing that's inside of it this is
one of those cups that you get at
Starbucks for like a dollar and then
every time you go you can fill it up you
get 10 cents off your drink if you use
this cup I don't even know if that still
applies but I don't do that I just use
this for my coffee in the morning and if
you guys have not been watching my
recent snapchats or my recent videos you
guys don't know that I'm obsessed with
coffee now it's actually really bad like
it's bad you like it's really bad I
drink coffee every morning before you
guys keep saying it stunts your growth
there's been studies proven that it
doesn't right now I just have puffiness
should I try no I'm not even gonna try
with this lip stuff
right now what time is it it's 4:16 this
is too late to be drinking coffee I need
to stop was doing things all day that I
made it in the morning I didn't end up
drinking it along the line of water
bottle cup thingies this is a swallow
water bottle if you guys suffer kind of
swell right there it is a Ronda bottle
that keeps things cold for 24 hours and
things hot for 12 hours and guys it's
not like it's not awesomenesstv give
this to me for Christmas gift a while
ago Oh what is this like I didn't know
what it was or anything also thank you
us in this TV I love you guys this is a
really good president I just like oh
okay I'll try this out and I started
using it like every morning before I got
really into coffee out of tea every
morning still caffeine I don't know I
guess I'm addicted to caffeine I'm
kidding I'm kidding
but I would put really hot tea in this
and then I'd go to school and I tried
Reiki it's so hot it stays hot I would
come home from school and it would still
be hot like that is crazy
I made myself coffee then I started
taking coffee in it because you know me
I prepared it like the night before and
it was hot and I put it in the fridge
and then when I opened it in the morning
and show the drinking it was still hot
this thing is crazy okay so I've been
loving that if I want to keep things hot
also going along with food this is a
little weird one but you know shown it
to you guys because it's been a favorite
is this whack Amole chunky guacamole
I love guacamole but this is from Trader
Joe's if you guys have introduced new me
you should go out and buy this it is
chunky guacamole but it is reduced guilt
it's so much healthier for you it's made
with Greek yogurt but it still tastes so
good it's 50% less fat and 40% less
calories it's crazy but it tastes so
good there's still little chunks of
vegetables in it and this was some chips
mmm what a good snack the next favorite
is this notebook so this notebook is
from poppin popin all white which I
really like in it on the inside let's
write on and then
there it looks like this which is line
like you can write the date and stuff
you can like write numbers or anything
it's not necessarily like this exact
notebook that's been a favorite I mean
it is but it's also just the fact of
writing things down making to-do lists
planning out my days I've been trying to
do that video ideas it's like everything
in my brain written down which is so
what's so nice because I have to
organize school YouTube sports or
whatever like there's just so much going
on in here it's just so nice to get it
down on paper but I feel like everything
is not you know like stressing out up
here and just look they're been loving
loving that so yeah that was pretty much
all of my favorites but I've been loving
and I hope you guys enjoyed this video
