hip hello oh my god hello immutable
beverage
so personally I have to have tea on a
paper night because I love it but shout
out my mug it's my merge so I made
myself some licorice tea I put some
stevia stevia of course for some
sweetness and then we good so now I'm
removing my makeup and this is like one
of my favourite things I just love
having a clean fresh face so the first
thing I'm going to do is take my take
the day off cleansing balm by Clinique
this is my new favorite way to take off
my makeup oh my god guys I'm serious
this product is amazing pretty much you
just take some from the container put it
on your face rub it around and your
makeup just glides off like instantly
glides off and I'm dressed removing my
makeup on half of my face just to show
you guys kind of like before and after
effect because it really it gets in
there and it takes that makeup off so
then I'm just wetting a towel and taking
off the rest of the makeup from over
those on my face so thank you to clinic
for sponsoring this video I've been
obsessed with your guys's products for
so long and was a pleasure working with
you guys this product effortlessly takes
off your makeup I'm obsessed as you can
tell okay let's continue so I don't know
about you guys but your girl has a lot
of peach fuzz which is on my face so I'm
just taking my Nair facial hair remover
and I'm just putting this pretty much
everywhere where my peach fuzz is the
worst I just love doing this because I
love having like a clean slate on my
face for makeup and my peach fuzz really
gets like all up in the makeup and it's
disgusting so I do this like once every
couple weeks whenever my peach fuzz gets
bad mouth remember to edit in shame ago
and stuff because I know you're going to
forget I was going to forget but yeah go
rinse it off afterwards anyways so now
I'm tweezing my eyebrows with my tweezer
minute tweezers my favorite tweezers and
I'm just pretty much cleaning them up
I'm not shaping them a lot but I'm just
making sure there's no stray hairs or
anything that's messing up the brows
because you know the brows got to be on
point I'm just weirdly obsessed with
eyebrows okay moving on after my brows
are done I am then going to of course in
my tea and take a bath it's bath time
one of my favorite times I don't know
there's just something about sitting in
a bath feeling all relaxed with candles
and whatever imma be honest sometimes
I'll use a bath bomb sometimes I'll just
use this soap that like works super well
so I just use the soap
today I'm just getting in the bath but
you can't see that so it's gonna go
black then really quickly I'm going to
moisturize my body with my Brazilian bum
bum cream after my bath and then I'm
doing my skincare routine but I'm not
going to show you guys the products
because I really want to do a skincare
routine video because I've been so into
skincare and I've cleared up my skin a
lot it's really red right now from the
naira thing but I'll show you guys in
another video so I'm just finishing up
my skincare routine with some secret
products I can't tell you what they are
right now that's usually all I do just a
mini pamper routine just to take care of
myself a little bit sometimes they do a
face mask whatever but I did a lot to my
skin today so I took a little easier
