much to tell you guys an update you guys
and I don't like I don't know where to
start I just wanted to do like a little
intro to this vlog because I'm a
terrible vlogger it's a thing I'm a
terrible mother
freaking vlogger but I just I forget to
record stuff I forget to take my camera
out it just it's a thing and I need to
fix it and also ignore my roots because
they're blonde because I'm a naturally
blonde and I dyed my hair dark so roots
look rough half the time I'll get them
done soon I guess I'm just gonna start
with the fact that I'm oh my god I have
way too much to explain but I lived in
an apartment for like four months and I
was gonna be there for a year but it was
just too small and I like I had cabin
fever half the time I don't know I just
I spend a lot of time at home because I
work from home my friends are at school
most of time stuff like that so I just
spend a lot of time at home and it
wasn't enough space it was one bedroom
and I just like I could barely walk and
I was bad so we upgraded and I got
myself oh my god woo woo gonna have
we're gonna have we're gonna it's not
breaking the bank or anything I don't
want to get any hate on this because
this is where I live and what I spend my
money on this is a huge house for the
price it's like it's so amazing I love
it there's so many rooms I'm doing so
much to this house like every room I
have a different purpose for it and I'm
gonna show you guys like a little tour

hey it's Mel from a different day what's
up I was editing this vlog and I was
noticing how all over the place it was
because I'm not the best vlogger I'm
just I really not I thought I would
finish this like intro that I was doing
but give you a little tour of the house
because I haven't really showed you guys
the house
the reason this vlog is like kind of all
over the place is because I've just been
working and moving and it's a lot a lot
of work a lot of steps a big process
I've made a good amount of progress so I
thought I would show you guys what I
have so far in the house it's really not
that much but it's what I got so far and
I need to look here and not at the
viewfinder like I always do I'm gonna
try to make the vlogs better and like
actually film daily for my vlog channel
this one was like multiple days because
I was doing so much throughout the days
that I could only vlog multiple parts
it's really what I've been up to the
past couple of days moving and getting
it done oh my goodness there's just a
lot of steps there's a lot of freaking
steps so I apologize if this vlog is all
over the place but I just really want to
make my vlogs my life nothing else and
like very genuine and whatever and this
is my life this is yeah if you guys were
wondering why lucky is here he didn't
fit in my apartment but he he's my
doggie and I want him to live with me
now since I have a house isn't that
right Bubba he doesn't have a toy yet so
he was putting with this cuz I they be
wet I have a uterine that's why it's
making that really love noise you hear
it I'm gonna do a really quick overview
just cuz I want to show you guys more
when it's done on my blog channel but
there's a room down here with a bathroom
this is the downstairs hey Bubba this is
gonna be
filming room holla the window right here
is perfect there's a little balcony out
there which I love you got closet all
that good stuff filming we gonna get
done in here this is gonna be the
productive room I'm sorry I'm a little
extra my office filming everything I
need to get done we'll be gettin dug
down here I got a lot of girls guys I
got a lot of goals we got stairs to go
to the upstairs this is my favorite part
by far I have this big open room here
that I wanna I don't know what I want to
do with this I got some mirrors from
Ikea a table this also is really big
right now but it closes to make it
smaller as well I have a piece of my
couch right here that didn't fit in the
other room so I could like look out here
but I can't really see the view from
this spot so I think I'm gonna move it
somewhere but I don't know yet there's a
nice backyard which I'll show you guys
later just because it's really wet and I
don't have shoes on lmao but literally
the view is just the most important
thing to me it's so nice it's just
what's that I need to clean my windows
the kitchen is a mess
so like ignore that everything kind of
connects to each other which I really
like
see hallway so this room has these
lights that I really like I just brought
my couch and here there's a TV but I
want to put the TV in the other room and
then put a projector on this wall so it
can be like the theater you feel me I'm
just like I'm so excited I can't buy the
railing my friend left his jacket what's
up Bert come and get your jacket and
then in this room I got my closet and
this is so messy but I'm gonna put like
a shoe wall I think this is for my
clothes because my clothes were crazy
unorganized in my apartment everything
like I didn't have enough storage for my
clothes for my stuff whatever like I
don't want to sound bratty but I love
fashion and like having a whole room to
fashion would just make me so happy and
like walking in there and seeing all of
my clothes laid out getting to make
outfits in there I'm just so excited I'm
just so freaking I'm a little fangirl
right now also comes with laundry which
is really nice I'm doing laundry ignore
that hell is storage so much storage
second bathroom with a tub holla
and then my room I don't to show you
guys too much just until I get
everything the way I want it bed here
what to do with I just don't know what
to do with my furniture yet and like how
to organize it but I
so have more closet space oh my goodness
I have so much storage I just like I'm
so happy I'm just not gonna feel messy
I'm gonna feel organized have everything
where I need it in the whole house I'm
just I'm someone who feels and organized
a lot of the time and I'm done with it I
want to feel organized all of the time
my bathroom is so messy but there's a
bathroom in here next to the closet and
all this stuff I also like the lights in
here I think they look cool so I mean
that was kind of the overview of Micasa
i'll show you guys like the backyard and
everything later but I just have so much
I want to do to this house and I just
can't wait till it feels like my house
and like everything is my style and just
I don't know I really want everyone to
walk into my house and like know it's my
house and just make it very me so I'm
