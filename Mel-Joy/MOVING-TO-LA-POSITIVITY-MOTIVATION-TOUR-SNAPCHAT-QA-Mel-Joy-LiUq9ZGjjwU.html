that every snapchat now every @qa I wear
sweatshirt it's a tradition I hope I

hardcore not cooperating with me today

getting snapchats
you guys are so cute so anyway we're
doing two snapchat Q&amp;amp;A it's good a very
good time I love you guys I love q and
A's
I feel like it's just a video where I
get to talk to you guys because you guys
are my best friends how did I start
youtubing just kind of sat in front of
camera and was like I'm gonna do a
middle-school advice video and that's
what I did it was really like um what's
the word I don't know it was very
impromptu impromptu it was very just
like in the moment I was like I'm gonna
start YouTube because I've always wanted
one and I'm gonna like I'm just gonna do
today cuz why not you only live once
oh I love you too
yes I would recommend going vegan I love
being vegan honestly there's so many
benefits you're helping the animals
you're helping the world you also just
feel really like light and energetic oh
you said I'm so good no you're not
awkward I love you too and what made me
want to start YouTube is that I'm
someone who loves beauty and fashion and
helping others I love like videography I
love beauty I love whatever getting it
be there for people like you guys and
getting to help you guys in any way and
just make a lot of friends you guys and
just things like that well I don't know
your Instagram he didn't say his
Instagram but following you in spirit
because you didn't say your Instagram
you is how did you get motivated to
start working out your accent I love you
too and she's from Canada it said it in
a little thingy how did I get in sprayed
it and sprayed it okay how did I get
inspired to work out that is a good
question when I went to the doctor when
I was younger they were like hey kid
like slow down on the eating okay okay
cuz I ate like an animal and I just
didn't care as I was just a free spirit
then I started playing basketball and I
started getting whipped in the shape
because those practices were hard with
me little chubster like Matt knowing
what they were doing I got really
whipped into shape from basketball and
then once basketball ended I was like oh
I really like being in shape because I
feel my best I like I've looked my best
and I just like feel energetic I feel
strong but I was just like I'm gonna
keep up with it and I'm just gonna work
out on my own so that's what I did I
love you too and I want the to move to
LA there's just like so many events that
I miss out on and like so many my
friends are down there I've heard some
here I miss my friends here so much but
I want to go to college in LA LA for
sure fo sho visit what Panama we're
playing in oh my god your accent and yes
I love you too and I want to visit
everyone I meet all you guys so if you
want to meet me then hit the link in the
downbar and request a city for my tour
so I can compete you guys because you
guys are my favorite and she asked for
me to follow her Instagram so yes I'll
do this up to this video I am a
screenshot of it I love you too and the
biggest Beauty mistake I ever made was
plucking my eyebrows too much you guys
know this I did a whole video on it it
was a bad time it was it was not fun
Oh bangs I had really bad banks I cut my
bangs literally he's like this and then
this one was higher than this one so I
like even them out and I ended up having
bangs like up here and they were like
thick and bad in I was in third grade
what you didn't make a brand and was
given credit from them like 20 times oh
that's the only video I got from you but
I love you so much - I love you more
actually selling new Jana but my
favorites brand right now is probably
two-faced and my favorite and you stop
touching my hair favorite product from
them is probably the Born This Way
Foundation because thing is going to the
grave with me oh I love you too when you
don't look gross girl you've worked that
mascara how I stay so positive is pretty
much how I thank you for calling me
positive that's very sweet of you but I
pretty much realized like hey as long as
I am aware I have like one life that I'm
gonna be living right now like might as
well live it to the fullest like why
focus on all the negatives surround
yourself with people that you love do
what you love spend life how you want to
because it's like you don't know what
could happen any second of any time I
just try to live my life to the fullest
and do what I want and really like have
my priorities straight I think that's
what makes me so positive is because I'm
doing what I love doing because I make
sure I'm doing that because I prioritize
that if that makes sense that was like a
small ramble but like it kind of made
sense right I hope I don't know I'm
gonna be completely honest with you I
remember saying someone that my third
hurt more than my cartilage but that was
just on my ear I'm being completely
honest with you but I don't think ear
piercings hurt that much if you're
comparing them to the rest your ears
then no it's just it stings a little
more I think that's I think that's what
it was
I love you too and actually while you're
watching this I might be in Canada I
might be going depends when I post this
video so girl hit me up a photo yes you
are so cute what but you didn't put your
Instagram my favorite color I think is
army green maroon grey black white even
the other shades are like a nude yeah I
have a lot of favorite colors and then
what she asked me really Mel I watched
the footage back to make sure I didn't
forget it because I did but she asked so
is my favorite thing about being a
youtuber and I think my favorite thing
about being a youtuber is having you
guys having like so many best friends
whenever I like tweet at you guys or
Instagram you guys like leave such nice
comments and I just get talked you guys
are also like helping you guys like if
there's any videos that you guys would
want to see like advice videos or
anything I love helping you guys and
like just being there for you guys like
I don't know you guys are also also just
like filming and editing so much fun and
it's like the best thing I love it your
freckles girl are gorgeous by the way
and I love you too and if I could collab
with any celebrity Kylie Jenner cuz she
slays my life
we're Dylan O'Brien does that count I
would love to do a video of him I love
you too um why do I keep doing YouTube
when I have to do with the hate well
haters gonna hate
I mean even when I didn't have YouTube I
had to deal with haters in real life
what keeps me doing YouTube is it's what
I love it's what I love doing and the
ratio of like haters and like lovely
people that will support me and comment
nice things it's like a not even I only
want to focus my attention on the people
that give me good feedback even like
constructive criticism is fine but like
hate is when I'm just like I'm not gonna
une of my time like I said I'm trying to
live my life to the fullest and Wow do I
waste my time on people that who are
trying to like make themselves feel
better by making me feel worse like nah
I love you too and my favorite movie is
clueless or personing Wallflower or
stuck in love those like the movies that
I could just like watch forever legit
praying never get a video video you're
adorable I love you to it can it be the
person who invented makeup is there a
person who like I could do like a really
educational like you know like a dead
president or something but I'm gonna do
something like completely honest let's
see can it be you guys that can mom if
you had to have you're so sweet thank
you thank you so much you are gorgeous
that was so sweet I love you too I'm
girl you're gorgeous you guys are all so
pretty but some advice for freshmen is
to be you I did a whole video on
freshman advice and all that's cheesy
like be yourself would never be like
that's how you're gonna find your true
friends that's how you're gonna like
enjoy yourself the most in high school
and do what you want to do if you want
to wear sweats and sweatshirt every day
that's what I did I did that in
sophomore year in freshman year I like
really cared if then it just stopped
caring that's when I got on my real
friend don't care about what people
think or say it can be dramatic in high
school just make things like a bigger
deal than it actually is some people
just really like drama my favorite type
of shoes I love shoes these ones
probably I love sneakers if that's like
type of shoes I've so many sneakers just
have like a whole thing of sneakers
right here sneakers are like my bomb.com
and also my Puma Rihanna slides are so
much fun to wear I love those things
I love you so much you're so sweet oh my
goodness you guys
my favorite video to film is probably
like sit-down videos or just get to talk
to you guys like this because I just
love talking to you guys if there's a
video where I could like meet you guys
this is bad a thing so probably just
like sit down chill videos or like
full-out
edited like cool videos cuz those are
really fun to like edit I love you too
my favorite TV show whoo okay that's
really her question cuz I've seen a lot
of fun probably stranger things even
those eight episodes like second season
where you ask then like probably like
all-time one is right now One Tree Hill
because there's nine seasons that's so
like I'm set on season I think eight
who's done I think come on season seven
or eight I love that show I love YouTube
how did I manage it well little things I
kind of didn't that's why I'm in online
school but if you're dealing with that
right now I would just suggest planers
helped so much that's what helped me so
much plan up your nights like every
night and everything out by the hour
that's what I did I love you too
and the hardest part about going vegan
was probably not getting me Froyo
I ate Frodo so much really good vegan
ice cream like soft-serve Froyo when
you're with like your own toppings like
that stuff was my favorite and then
there is no more but it's okay cuz I
love being vegan and I can live with
that Froyo it was just it was hard for a
little bit oh no I said love you in the
chat box oh I love you too I have almost
17,000 photos
it's from December 14th 2014 and it is a
Chipotle that's so difficult
how did you start YouTube and breaking
oh no okay whoever that was I'm sorry my
phone just notified me something and I
lost your question

this question but like loving makeup and
loving video and I've watched my sister
