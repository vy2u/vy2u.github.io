too old for ya my dad with us hope I'm
holding the power off the why did you
bully dummy cool cool difficult item you
look Gavin not like that you never do
you mention what I would a bad bitch
Phillip instituting book go I'm young
every possible I think they hit the
subscriber in our you a favor
he was the stated point
hello my beautiful birthday this video
is going to be a car tour of my baby my
child this is literally my dream car
guys I've been saving up this car have
been wanting it since I don't even
remember pretty much the car that I have
is the Range Rover Sport 2017 se so if
you know to my channel hello my name is
mal it is great to meet you I would
really appreciate it if you would
subscribe I have faith you know where
the button issues without you guys none
of this would be possible so I really
quickly just wanted to say thank you for
all your constant love and support it
really means the world to me and mean so
much I know it's really loud out here
it's not the best way to say this but I
just wanted to say thank you it means
the world to me you guys mean more to me
than this car items won't ever mean more
to me than you guys and your love and
support so thank you but I'm just really
quickly going to show you guys to my car
and how it works and what it looks like
because so many of you guys have been
asking for this video so I thought I
would give it to you so let's do this I
saw my last car tour was AG patriot and
I know a lot of you guys are probably
wondering where scout scout was actually
sold to subscribers that I didn't know
it was going to be subscriber but Yap
will forever be missed but my style did
change so I didn't love it as much and
that's why I wanted to get this far I
could this guy came car and I'm exposed
to this so pretty much you open the door
I'll show you the keys you look like
this it looks like this on the inside
this is the steering wheel just as you
know Range Rovers to get those car
photos you feel me pretty much the
interior is all black same with the
outside but there's like a white and
like panitch branched off like ceiling
to show you guys the finish of the car
I'm going to get a flashlight as you can
see it's like 10 funky you know it's
like cool because it's like purplish
green little specks so in the Sun it
looks really cool some into it when you
open the back doors with the closet plan
what I really like about these bespoke
for my friends comfort they move back if
you want them to if this is your dream
car and you want to know what the
functions are and what it does pretty
much you pull the switch and if you go
down just to use this basis like I'm a
bigger trunk and then do it backwards
you just lift it up and push it down so
it's like more lean so you're more
comfortable in the back
door has a couple compartments the first
one being this little one I just have
chapstick my keys and I literally keep
whatever I want to just like grab and go
in this and then down here I'm not don't
even don't even it's gross I literally
have like old sugar packets gum you know
you need that gum we got a variety of
shades only one shower I also have stuff
like this sugar-free candy because I get
cavities really easily dark they're
super sweet so a couple details the
first one being this you can set
positions in your seating to like make
it more comfortable and then just set
them same on the passenger seat for my
friend unlock the doors windows all that
good stuff so pretty much when you're
sitting in the driver's seat this is
where you first see the wheel you got
the phone you can talk on the phone with
this skip songs just volume this is
cruise control over here it shows my
speed which goes up to 180 but don't go
to all sounds kids that's what I really
like about this is that it shows like if
everyone has their seatbelt on through
the home screen looks like this you got
music which you can change like radio
whatever you can put songs on the car I
just use my phone when I do this like
bluetooth for this this is just my
iPhone attached to it that's like always
attached so I can call people this just
helps you navigate places it's like
directions but comes with the car and
there's like all these settings that I
could talk about for a long time it's
just like stuff to change the car the
volume whatever and there's also this
which is like a lot going on right here
then this is the cameras here it's just
to help me when I back it up and stuff
really helpful actually you could
literally also make this like a phone
and put data on it and use like
Instagram whatever it's pretty sick you
can do voice commands
there's contacts Eco data all actually
know what I'm going to put in anyways
you can use that if you put data in it I
believe which I don't think I have data
in it because like I'm not going to
watch videos as I Drive I'm sorry if any
of this is dirty I just got it cleaned
but there's still some dirty spots so
this is where you control the
temperature it's actually really cool
because you get two sides so a person
can have a harder time to turn one can
have a lower I got to have the balanced
energy drink and the bar you got to have
the fidgets look how just so
effortlessly it is
gotta have is a necessity so there's a
button on the back that you push to put
into lake park this is sport mode pretty
much that's how you work that I'm going
to put it in park
and you literally just press this one to
put in part this is the emergency brake
you flick it up to put it on it's like
the simplest thing in the world this is
where the off-roading starts because it
is a Range Rover so it is four-wheel
drive at all times
but this is for snow this is for like
muddy areas and this is for desert like
sand and then this is how you raise and
lower the car it's moving but you can't
feel it because you're watching - foam
is somewhere this I can put a speed
limit literally for myself so I don't
want to like go faster than a certain
speed so then this is also part of this
whole low center space I bought like
paper towels and stuff from here to like
clean a lot of sugar-free candy I'll
tell you that anyway so when you open it
it comes with all of this cool stuff so
this is a sim card so you can put data
on here and do whatever watch movies
literally anything HDMI I don't know
what that's for you can like plug in
your PlayStation or something ok so I
gotta play some action cannot be
yourself right there hmm
these are two USBs discharging stuff
with that and that also works to play
music like these clothes do as a charger
phone which is super cool so it's
sitting in the passenger seat this is
what it looks like you've got the glove
box you just push a button and it comes
down there's like nothing on here a lot
of people get confused by that then you
have the same setting stuff over here so
in this we have what is oh this is my
tire pressure gauge this is just for
when you want to check your tire
pressure to make sure you don't have a
flat tire and then moving on to this
I'll even know what this is but it says
Land Rover this is how you control the
temperature for back here there's a
little spot to put stuff and then more
ways to charge your phone and do
whatever another little compartment just
a lot of storage in this car and now we
go into the trunk is it going I didn't I
don't think I was even doing this and
this is my trunk it's super spacious
there's another tire under here with
more space as well we've got a blanket
for in case you want to go to the beach
or anything you never know a blanket
comes in handy and then we got scooter
of course because woodard iGrow
my license plate because I took those
off for safety reasons and then we have
this bag from it cosmetics this is my
bag for stuff that I need in case that
they happen I don't know
we got like sweatpants in here water
whatever just in case was an earthquake
and I got to survive I got this for all
the little car junkies out there that
want the details the details in this
this is what's on my car and then on the
Range Rover HSE it is like gills people
call them or offer them and I just like
lines on the car but this is what my car
has a little different but I like it I
like it better so and then down here is
the wheel it just says Land Rover but
these are the wheels just the ones it
comes with I want to get all blocked out
ones though so keep me to that hold me
to that because I want to get this also
the speakers are really good as you can
hear ten out of ten okay so thank you

in my car slash cardboard type of video
