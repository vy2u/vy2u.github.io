are you guys I hope you're doing good
yes you today's video is going to be my
current favorites I used to do like a
monthly favorites video every month I
think I think I was on top of it I could
have been so wrong but I haven't done a
video like this in a while I thought why
not update you guys on the products the
food the that I should love it and if
you're new to my channel and you haven't
seen my face before or one of my videos
before I would really appreciate it if
you click that subscribe button down
below and also click the little
notification ballot if you want to be
notified for every time I post video I
didn't do monthly favorites just because
this isn't all this month it could be a
long time it could be a short time of it
being my favorite product we're gonna
start with fashion because fashion is my
passion let's see so I guess the first
trend slash pieces of clothing that I've
been loving is the print camel of course
where's my camel pillows in this I just
I love camel but the first piece of
clothing is just how am I gonna show
this it's this orange and black and
green and white camo jacket
it's from I'm Jia and I've been wearing
this like crazy I think it's so cute
orange my favorite color camo one of my
favorite prints one of my favorite
outfits with this it's like a all black
outfit and then like this jacket I don't
know I've been obsessed with camo I just
I love it
the second piece of camo clothing is
just these camel pants camo pants like
this are actually kind of hard to find
or they work for me at first and then
now I own several pairs of camo pants
because I love them there's a lot of
different styles when it comes to camo
pants and fitting these are probably one
of my favorite pairs because they're
high-waisted or you can make them
high-waisted and then tighten them here
so I can wear them like low waisted high
waisted they're like really big and
bulky and baggy and these are from Urban
Outfitters I wore they used to rolling
around I don't remember what I left in
them we got a train ticket and we got
the Sony's check these out
BAM so going along with the fashion
pieces I'm just gonna talk about a
couple things the first being at these
shorts and they're from Juicy Couture
color blocking slash like
like this I just I've been obsessed with
I love sweat shorts I don't know why
they're just really comfortable this was
like a crop top is just like a cute
casual outfit I don't know I love this
style
I love the font I love the colors I love
the pattern pattern for example if I
wear this with it it would be look
another favorite of mine is beanies and
this is just this is a beanie from my
March actually and I'm not going to turn
it around because it says something on
it that I don't want you guys to see yet
I had all my merch up for a second and
then I wanted to fix it because I'm a
perfectionist like after I got it in the
mail but I couldn't find my other
beatings I thought I would show you this
one and tell you new March coming soon /
I love being it's a perfect way to cover
up your bad hair day or just look like a
badass so let's go into shoes because I
just talked about fashion so like you
know so my next favorite are just slides
like this shoe I'm just showing these
two because I wear these constantly like
every day I wear them more than shoes
probably I have these camel ones from
urban Metro got me I were these non-stop
because camo but they're like fluffy
still and then these ones which are from
Fenty and I have worn these for so long
I could not live without these shoes
I'm telling you that but slides like if
you don't want to pair slides girl
they're just they're amazing I wear them
with socks and sweats and a t-shirt
every day and I love them these shoes
are the next shoe favorite and I've
talked about these before in a haul I
love basketball shoes and the color the
style these are the Nike Air Jordan
Retro ones I believe I think I want to
get them in like yellow and black and
like a ton of different colors these
might be my favorite type of shoe except
for bands
I can't not wear vans I love bands so
something I've been obsessed with are
like cool colored glasses they're really
dirty just thought I would show you a
couple I have this one this one and
these ones because you got a half cloud
what I love about sunglasses like this
is you can wear them on your head and it
like looks cute and adds a lot
outfit or you can put them on and look
even doper I love them I think color
sunglasses and sunglasses in general can
add it so much to an outfit and really
make it the style you want you feel me
so get yourself some color sunglasses
because they're really fun and all my
friends love them by the way they were
then constantly like I've lost half of
the glasses I own so I have some beauty
products I want to talk about real quick
so the first product is this elf aqua
primer mist and I got this for a video I
filmed a couple of years back I have
been using this like almost everyday
sense if my makeup ever feels gross or I
just need to feel refreshed I will whip
this bad boy out it has really good
spring power I will tell you that so I
want to talk about this brush line slash
this brush too I used to only use Beauty
blenders for my foundation but now I'm
really into brushes because the Smashbox
line that they sent me of brushes they
all have the little like red stick and I
love this brush for foundation this is
the full coverage foundation brush and
I've been using this every day for my
foundation instead of my Beauty Blender
so look at that
this is a one dollar product from ELF I
think it's one dollar you pretty sure
it's one dollar and it's pretty much
just like a wax stick but I put it in my
eyebrows after I do them this keeps my
eyebrows in place all day I just I don't
know I'm not a huge fan of like the
clear gel stuff because it like makes my
eyebrows feel stiff you know like when I
move them it's like it's not a cute
feeling but for this I don't even feel
it so I'm happy about it oh I dropped it
and then the next favorite is just a
candy cane chopstick get rid of the boo
pillows we move it on to Christmas but
I'm just too excited I had to get the
candy cane chopstick now it smells like
candy cane it tastes like candy canes
yes yeah if they made a candy corn
chopstick my mind would be blown so the
next makeup favorite is this makeup
extender setting spray and it's just
from Lori oh and it's the infallible pro
spray and set I used to only use the
Urban Decay setting spray and then I
found this bad boy and it's cheaper and
it's good it's good visual
spread the last Beauty favorite is this
blending brush makeup blending brush and
this is from Mota Pro I believe I got
this in a PR package but it is the BMX
4:30 crease brush I have been trying to
find the perfect crease brush for so
long this is fun so the next two
favorites are candles I'm a huge candle
fanatic since I live on my own now I
always want my place to smell amazing
and have like a good vibe and when I see
candles like lit up I feel chill like I
have a good vibe this one is literally
gone this one has a little left these
are the Oh God Chesapeake Chesapeake Bay
mind and body candles
this one is balance and harmony with
water lily pair and this one is joy plus
laughter and it's cranberry Dahlia
Dahlia Dahlia these smell just so good
they're from Target they're not super
expensive really quickly
really really where we wrap up this
video I need to talk about food I need
to talk about something one of my new
favorite foods it's oatmeal I don't
really know why but I'm obsessed with it
Oh Mia was always a weird thing to me
and now I won't you get everyday this
one is the multigrain at triple berry
with flax and chia seeds instant hot
cereal from Trader Joe's looks like that
there are so many different types of
foam here like I never knew banana bread
is when my favorites cinnamon apple like
just so many we're just so good the next
favorite are these bear baked crunchy
coconut chips these are in the chocolate
flavor but I personally I think I like
the normal coconut ones better than the
chocolate ones but these are still
really good they're just little baked
crunchy pieces of coconut and they're
really good I love coconut if you don't
like coconut you won't like these I
promise I think the last favorite of
this whole video is pretzels lives these
are also from Trader Joe's and they're
just dark chocolate covered pretzels but
they're so these are deadly because
you'll have one and you'll want to eat
double it's salty it's sweet it's just
it's yes I think I'm gonna wrap up this
