so today's video is going to be an
everyday makeup routine and this video
has been suggested so so much so I
thought it would be a good video to make
for you guys just pretty much what I
wear everyday to school and then on
weekends if I decide to wear makeup I'll
wear something along these lines this
look there's some things that I talk
about that sometimes I'll skip it or
I'll do this instead or things like that
so you'll find that out in the video if
you want to see all the stuff I put on
my face every day stay tuned and keep
watching hey guys so the first thing I
do is I take my belief moisturizer and I
just apply this all over my face make
sure I got no dry skin and then I take
my baby skin primer from Maybelline and
this is like a poreless primer and I
just press all over my face to prime my
face for the makeup and then I take my
Amazonian clay foundation from Tarte and
I apply this all over my face and then I
blend it out with my Real Techniques
brush and I love this foundation because
it's not too heavy but it's not too
light it's like the perfect amount of
coverage and I love it with this brush
because it makes look really natural and
then I take my age rewind concealer from
Maybelline and I just apply this kind of
around my mouth and my nose because I
tend to get really red there throughout
the day
and then I'm just blending it with the
same brush and then I take my NARS
creamy concealer in vanilla and oh my
goodness guys this is an amazing
concealer I recently got this so I just
apply this under my eyes and triangles
and then on my forehead on my chin and
right where I highlight and I'm just
blending this out with my ring finger
because that is the best finger to use
and then I also just use a brush to
blend out the other concealer on my face
and I love this this is probably my
favorite step of the makeup and I also
put some on my nose I forgot to say that
so then I take my Laura Mercier powder
this is a setting powder I love this
stuff this isn't translucent and I kind
of bake it like I bake where I put the
concealer but I don't completely bake it
I like naturally bake it just because I
like this look better and at the end of
my makeup I blend it out with a
different brush but right now I just
lightly bake it so it's just a little
more than I would usually wear and I'm
also just applying this all over my face
as a powder as well and then I take my
hoola bronzer from benefit I love this
stuff and I just use the brush that's
already in it because I know I like it
and I apply it on my cheekbones my
jawline and my temples and I just blend
it out with my ELF powder brush to make
it look more natural and not as harsh
lined or anything then I take my what's
up highlighter from benefit I'm just
using this as a base for my highlight I
don't usually highlight everyday when I
go to school because I get
or they've done the day so sometimes I
skip this step and then I'm taking my
physician's formula globe pearls or I'll
use the shimmer strips I love both of
those products and I just supply that
with my fan brush or with my fingers and
blend it out and then for blush I use my
Amazonian clay blush and exposed I
pretty much never wear blush to school
just because I'm a pink person and it
shows throughout the day but when I do
use blush like on the weekends or
something this is the one I use and then
I'm taking the buff eyeshadow in the
lower I could pro 2 palette and I'm just
putting this all over my eyes for base
and then I'm taking wisp from this
palette and I'm putting this in my
crease with my Lexi brush I love this
brush and I love this color because it
looks so natural but then to add a
little definition to my eyes I'm taking
twig which is a darker color and I'm
focusing this in the outer V and then
blending into my crease sometimes I skip
eyeshadow from lazy in the morning but
if I wear eye shadow this is usually
what I wear I really like that I shadow
I think it looks really pretty and then
I'm just blending it so it looks natural
and then I'm blending it with my
Ecotools brush as well and then I'm
taking my matte brow highlighter from
chela and I'm applying this right under
my brows and then I just blend that out
and that's all I do for my brows except
for combing them through so after that I
just use a bra spoolie pretty much any
spoolie and I just comb through them to
get them all situated and then I take my
master precise eyeliner from maybelline
and I really need a new one of these
because it's drying out as you can see I
like shake it a lot but I just apply a
really thin line to my upper lash line
and I'll also occasionally wing it out a
little bit um but I just try to keep it
looking natural but it helps to darken
my eyelashes to make it look thicker
which I really like
so then I take my Aqua eyeliner from
makeup forever it's really small and
then I just put this on my tight line
just to darken and make my eyelashes
look thicker then I take this
exaggerated eyeliner from Rimmel London
and it's in in the nude and I put this
on my waterline cuz it makes my eyes
look so much bigger as I'm showing you
and I love this step and I take my Sally
Hansen's eyelash curler and I just curl
my lashes to pretty much how curled I
want them I really liked him curled so I
do that for a while and then I take my
telescopic mascara from L'Oreal and this
is the first mascara I use I am in love
with mascara so just wait guys I use a
lot but I just put one coat of this on
my upper and lower eyelashes for my
first mascara and my second mascara I
take the better than sex mascara from
Too Faced I love this stuff and I just
put this right on top of the telescopic
mascara and then I made this face I
don't remember why but yeah I'm just
finest my upper and lower lashes and
then I take the their real mascara this
mascara is mostly dried out so this just
helps kind of dick clump everything but
I need to get into movies and then I
just put on my upper and lower eyelashes
then I take my clump crusher mascara I
really like this stuff because I can get
it right in the net corners because the
tip of the brush is really small and it
helps crush those clumps
and then I take the their real mascara
one last time
just to go through all the mascara to
make sure there's no clumps and yeah
that's my mascara and then I take this
comb and I comb through my eyelashes so
there will be no clumps and it just
makes it look more natural so I like the
SEPA step is it very important for me
and then I take the elf lip exfoliator
and that just exfoliate my lips so
there's a good a good base for that
lipstick and lip liner coming up so then
I take this starlooks lip liner in que
Frio 8 bear this is what I've learned a
lot of my videos and a lot of people ask
me what I wear so this is it and then I
take this essence lipstick and shade 11
nude love and I just put it on top and I
really like this combo and then I take
my luck C taper brush for the last step
and make sure there's no excess powder
from the light baking that I did earlier
and yeah that's the completed look so I
hope you guys enjoyed that video of my
