makeup like I Hollywood on camera but I
can't do the voice-over and this is
going to kill me for my perfectionism
because it's just going to kill me and
she's going to do the voice-over and I
don't know if you knows a lot about
makeup or not so this should be
interesting and it's a matter of my

she will get a new brush blend that in
and continue the same process on the
other eye she's gonna add some more
colors here pretty colorful
on the outside of her eye and she's
gonna blend that in to center keep doing
that again she had a nice like white
color to the inside of her eye on the
top and bottom it's gonna keep doing
that she's gonna bring that to the
center and she's going to blend that
into the other parts of her eye
throughout it and she's gonna get a
brush here for her fake eyelashes and

little bit
some powder that powder is going to go
on the bottom for eyes and her nose a
