welcome back to my channel and if you
are new to my channel Hey ml nice to
meet you hope today's video is going to
be probably my most requested video ever
I get multiple comments on pretty much
all of my videos to do this video so can
you guess what it is
it is a eyebrow routine I get a lot of
comments on a lot of my videos asking
how I grab my eyebrows how I transformed
my eyebrows how they are the way they
are because it used to be very different
if you have been on my channel since the
start these babies have gone through a
lot honey I've definitely not always
looked like this I'm just happy we are
at the state but we're at now but I
definitely went through some hard times
just my eyebrows so I'm going to talk
about how I grow out my eyebrows and how
I transformed my eyebrows and then I'm
also going to talk about my eyebrow
routine but it's pretty simple so in
like eighth grade I'm in tenth grade now
I thought it would be a great idea to
plug my eyebrows I don't even remember
the day or when or how I did this I just
remember looking back at photos being
like what what I'll insert some photos
here here here everywhere I have
accepted the fact that I had terrible
eyebrows my eyebrows were mad before but
then when I pluck them it just it was
not good and ignore my band-aid it's cuz
I had stitches so what happened is I
tweeze see this part of my eyebrow like
the front I tweeze them to like there
and then I just made it all really small
they were small and short I'm definitely
not trying to diss me one who has
eyebrows like me or anything just the
fact that I did that I also got made fun
of a lot behind my back I didn't realize
it until I left middle school and people
tell me to this day oh yeah they call
them caterpillars oh yeah they call them
this whenever I see my middle school
friends I go hey what's up like guys are
you my gosh now I'm going to check
I got fit from that so what I did is I
grew up my eyebrows if you can tell
can't feel different so what I would
suggest if you ended up making a mistake
like me but I didn't even do this
because I was an eighth grader and I
don't know didn't come to my mind to
purchase a Vaseline or eyebrow or
eyelash growth serum because they have
that and all you do is you just put it
in your eyebrows overnight or whatever
and then it just helps your hairs grow
faster if you're trying to grow your
eyebrows and I did not do that and it
took me like a year and a half to get my
eyebrows exactly how I want you to them
so I would definitely suggest doing that
and then stay away from plucking or
waxing or anything I know this is gonna
be really hard just because you're gonna
see hair seems like even though no no
but I know even when I was growing out
my eyebrows I was still pluck some
occasionally and then when they would
start to grow back a big thing I should
have plucked up because it would have
filled in perfectly right there if
you're talking about you know hairs that
are like all the way up here all the way
down there well like right in the middle
that's a different story but they might
grow it in a place might not look really
good with the eyebrows you have then but
when your eyebrow is fully grown out
you're going to wish that you had that
one here you put like I have done that
before that is how I grew out my
eyebrows you have to be patient and I
know it's so hard because eyebrows are
like such a big thing now and eyebrows
on fleek for eyebrow game strong also if
you really don't feel comfortable with
it you can always fill them in I never
did that just cuz I didn't think of any
of these things I was literally in
eighth grade and I was like actually I
did feel them in freshman year to just
help as they were growing that's another
thing if you really don't feel
comfortable with your eyebrows that's
pretty much my eyebrow story I don't
really know what else to say
but I'm just gonna insert photos along
just to show you guys cuz I used to be
really self-conscious but I don't have
bone marrows I don't talk about it but
now I just these funny looking back on
them and being like wow what did I do
now I'm going to shop on my eyebrow
routine and how I shaved my eyebrows how
I keep them like this I have never
gotten my eyebrows professionally done
and they do not plan to but I feel like
I might
I don't know I don't know I do my
eyebrows by myself just because I'm a
little scarred by that instant I don't
want it occurring again so the two tools
I know - I use is my tweezers and my
eyebrow spoolie I mean it's an eyebrow
pencil but I don't use the pencil side
my eyebrow routine is really basic and
boring just because I don't fill in my
eyebrows
I don't wax them or anything I have
Sally Hansen's wax strips that I'll
occasionally use in my eyebrows go out
like a lot of like no no no because I
don't like tweeze it all usually I just
tweeze my eyebrows like every weekend
sometimes just like at night when I'm
bored and I see some strange eyes like
I'm just gonna go shake them a little
bit but I keep this natural shape and
then I just tweeze with above and below
I don't go in and start tweezing things
and try and make it thinner once you get
the shape that you want and they like
fullness that you want keep it and just
pluck around it and that's what I have
been doing right now to show you that I
don't have any special tracing
strawberry I'll just go in and I'll just
little ones around my brows and then the
next step is I get a spool you can
literally use any spoolie and I just
comb through and I just shape them how I
want I just go like this I just get them
and I literally just comb through and
then sometimes I go up like this and
then brush it over but like that brush
it over
I have tried doing the thing where
people brush it up and then you get
scissors and you like cut that off I'll
just another I'd rather take I made
because it thinned out my eyebrows so
much so I personally don't like doing
that I just like pulling them through I
like my eyebrows to be thicker you know
just like fuller and then also what I do
is I'll get a brow highlight lips I've
just been using this one and it's the
cella ivory lace highlighter
it's literally just like a stick and
I'll just go in and I'll just like put
that under to highlight my brows that's
pretty much all I do its Matt I like a
matte highlight especially if I'm not
like wearing a shadow or something yeah
my eyebrow routine is really simple you
guys keep asking for it and I don't want
to like under-deliver just cuz this is
what I do like it's literally they're
like do I know you guys really wanted to
