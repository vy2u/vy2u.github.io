Mel so sorry again for the plain
background my curtain is still not fixed
so I can't fill in my regular spots hope
it doesn't bother you too much today's
video is just going to be my go-to
everyday easy curls I think this look is
so pretty it's so natural but also like
elegant and nice at the same time it
like looks like you put effort into your
hair but not too much where it looks
like no you're going to a ball or
something I love this look it's so easy
to do it's cute fun flirty I don't know
I really like wearing it looks pretty
much just loose curls and I'm using the
new me time 3 set in this video I would
definitely recommend this you guys it
comes with 3 ones
19 millimeter twenty five milliliter and
thirty-two milliliter I use the biggest
one for this look just to get the
natural waves I would suggest this for
multiple things if you guys want to see
how to get this look this hairstyle um
stay tuned and keep watching so I put
some heat protectant in my hair I
brushed my hair just to get all the
tangles out I now divided my hair into
two pieces
cute right I put on the new me glove I'm
using the biggest wand and it is the 32
millimeter one just because I've pretty
long here and I want the girls to be
kind of like loose and we're going for
the simple look not too done up or
anything I'm just taking sections about
this big of my hair I'm just curling it
away from my head and wrapping it around
the barrel like so so we're just gonna
chill here for a couple seconds I think
I have a set at 200 degrees not sure
laughter I'm just going to grab the hair
bring it down look how pretty that is
I would definitely recommend wearing the
glove because my friend was using this
the other day and she didn't wear the
glove and she burned herself so many
times but the glove is really helpful
I'm also just holding this and I'm
curling away from my head as you can see
yeah alright
they create such like pretty
natural-looking ways so I'm just gonna
repeat this on this side grabbing it
putting it behind my head and then
curling it away from me catching it
scrunching it and knitting it down look
come on
that's so pretty after I finished one
side this is how one side looked I just
really like to keep it natural waves you
know because this is something that I
would like for to school I didn't lie
here like this for homecoming actually
so now I'm just going to repeat the same
thing I did on this side to this side
but make sure to switch the glove and
side thing huh
and also this is a titanium wand all of
them are so makes you hear like really
shiny - which i think is very helpful
I finished curling my bottom layer of
hair and this is what it looks like so
far so I'm going to do now is I'm going
to let down my upper layer of hair put
that down and I'm going to just curl the
upper layer of my hair I'm going to
still use the big barrel just because I
want this to be like a natural look but
if you wanted to have a more like
tighter look I would use the our Jews
the 25 milliliter or the 19 milliliter
because that will get you smaller curls
but I want to do the most natural look
so I'm just going to do pretty much what
I did on the bottom layers to my top
layer
and after you I kind of just combed
through it just to make the curls look
more natural
all right push my hands through it get
everything how I wanted I want it to
look love this look I think it's so
pretty and natural and like this is
appropriate to wear on an everyday basis
and it doesn't look too formal but I've
never had a curling one that has worked
this well the titanium barrels make your
hair look so shiny and smooth and I
think I actually really like that about
it the curls last a really long time
when I used it for homecoming they
stayed in the entire night and the day
after until I washed my hair so this is
pretty much the final look it's really
natural simple I also have two coats to
give out to guys the first coat I'm
reading off the screen is uh is me
