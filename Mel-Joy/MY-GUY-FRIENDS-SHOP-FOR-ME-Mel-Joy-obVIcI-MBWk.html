the shower thing be honest yeah much
harder than I thought
all right we're gonna stand up right now
all right so we're out here yeah was
know we got are these shoes all right
people don't like see how hard it is
like vlogging is yeah that was hard no
after a day of shopping and likes left
like I gotta take a nap here in that
mood you guys are like nice I'm good to
eat the sushi and play video wondering
this during the vlog do we start this
part or that part that part that's what
like no this part everyone likes here
including me were you looking here you
you're doing which I mean it's like you
want to look there because you can like
see what you know I guess that's where
you're supposed to look at there god I'm
nervous
all right hmm
no you see that's what we all shop there
we don't do bees okay this is a girls
section huh yes
there's no life I personally straight-up
honest me what it was out for myself I'm
gonna try it on but like first glance I
didn't love like gross big like it just
looks very girly when I first look at
they don't know why I got that vibe did
you get that vibe like the pink yeah
when I saw the thing goes pink isn't my
favorite color the orange the red this
is just like it's like watch what size
it's a medium but I like that I like
oversized things guys you guys know I
love see guy section is on you says okay
this looks really comfy like even if
you're sleeping and lounging I think I'm
gonna keep this this is 250 20 $25 what
200 trip yeah no okay no it's definitely
not worth the price um but would you
like it pastels aren't my favorite thing
they like I went through like a very
like pastel phase you know it's like the
pink and the purple and the blue but I'm
like I wouldn't wear this honestly that
like I wouldn't think so
I feel like Draya we were this great was
yeah actually shopping for this is kind
of insane it's just like regular billion
I mean like it's a nice material but
Topshop Daniel oh wait why I've been
looking for these where did you get them
boobies I like these I really do I have
multiple pairs I've been looking for
this exact color to the yellow and
whatever so like that's a win but I
don't think they're gonna fit just
because like the sizing and these are
really weird but I do like these I'm
gonna try them on if they fit I'm
keeping them so like this is this was a
yes I need like a great your two before
what is it
you like two of the four things we got
you and drape the other two so it really
likes the other two all right sounds
like nice baloney
oh my god I was gonna buy a hoodie of
this and I saw at UM oh yeah okay
I bought this Stoney I don't like this
and it's also orange what you're hearing
like these shoes so they're velvet all
black bands I don't hate them I like
them I think I just like velvet shoes
for me like really need to have like a
certain vibe they can't just be every
shoe velvet you know what I mean like
the Puma creepers I think they were cool
velvet like some other shoes well but
like I can't buy with it but these like
I like bands I like the old black
aspects like I feel like I really have
to like half the perfect up but with
this like I can see you guys picking
these out of me like this was I haven't
even seen these like I didn't know this
was a thing yeah all black I would
definitely wear this I'm proud of you
this is good and I like this I really
like the champion thank you there's more
of course this is from Brandi huh yeah
johnboll is also you know you wouldn't
so all white hoodie says Los Angeles on
the sleeves
I like this I've seen something else
yeah if it says something else I think I
would like it more just cuz like Los
Angeles I feel like it's kind of just a
basic thing to put on something but I
like it like I like the style of it like
I can see myself doing something like
this yeah like they're writing of it
yeah I like in the position honestly to
like where it is what it says I have one
yeah cuz I like the white red - yeah
it's like a cropped crewneck and then
the bottom like you thought is huh I
like that I like the print the camera
died oh my god it's about a day I'm
gonna say I wouldn't buy this and pick
it out for myself but it's not like it's
not terrible I think I'd have to try it
on just cuz I don't know how I feel
about this but I like the whole like
cropped crewneck sweatshirt vibe like
that's cool but overall I think you guys
did pretty good stuff at the top shops
was in the past how do you guys think
you did like no I think you guys did
pretty good but some valuable lessons
though that's all that matters that
learned when our vlog learned a lot well
we didn't really is we don't really get
the wrong within the entire time yeah
you learned how it's an issue it's a
shot it's not just you guys it's a lot
youtuber is it's hard it's me feel
better I think that's it for this video
but I hope you guys enjoyed and if you
did make sure to subscribe I love you
guys to infinity and beyond
