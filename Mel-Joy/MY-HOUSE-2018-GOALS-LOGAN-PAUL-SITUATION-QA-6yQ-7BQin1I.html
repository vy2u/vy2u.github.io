what's new if you in my channel what is
up my name is Mel it is great to meet
you I sound a little sick I've just been
working a lot
I didn't moving is a lot of work and
school and just everything it's a lot
but I'm learning a lot learning about it
if you didn't know I always wanna be in
a Q&amp;amp;A I don't know why I say that and I
feel the need to point it out I don't I
tweeted a while ago for you guys to ask
me questions that I can answer because I
have not been a QA and so long
I honestly try to do it at least once a
month but that just did not work out at
all but I'm gonna try again we're gonna
we're gonna keep trying till I get it or
at least just more two days I feel like
for me that's how you guys get to see
like what's happening in my life what's
new in my life I need to update you guys
on my life I've been slacking and to do
so let me know what's new in your life
comment down below if the asshole has
broken your heart because send these at
my will or if just you're doing good
school I don't know just let me know how
you're doing I obviously
and okay and I read your comments unless
three comments don't read those so I got
a lot of questions asking about my house
I'll insert some of them here but like
how was it living alone and I'm loving
my new house house
what am I most excited about my house
things like that I don't know I just I
wanted to talk a minute about the house
situation because I didn't do that great
of a job in the last thing I talked
about it in my last video but I am
leasing I'm only gonna be in this house
for like a year or something it's not my
house it's not like brand-new at all
it's been around a very long time but I
love it it's like Sony it's kind of
crazy the view just the layout I'm kind
of obsessed so I just feel like it was
meant to happen because it happened so
quick and like it just gives me really
good vibes and it wasn't vibes that I
was getting into my apartment and my
apartment like literally living there
just like made me not my best because it
was just wasn't enough space and I
wasn't one to like go out like you know
adventures by myself all day like I was
staying home and working whatever it was
like suffocating me and here I feel like
almost like freer and like I get to see
you know an amazing view half the time
my other view was like train tracks and
my neighbors so I'm feeling very blessed
about this it worked out perfectly it's
kind of crazy
that's when I really think things in
life are meant to be when they work out
like to perfect for it's like what like
how did that happen
you don't I mean but it's amazing right
now I have so much more to do and
there's so much like upkeep with the
house honestly what I'm most excited
about is like using this space for just
everything I want to do I mean does have
a so many plans about merch and well not
even merch maybe a clothing just pulled
up this week I feel like there's just so
much more I can do here I'm going to
film so many videos I'm really excited
as you can tell and I'm really hoping
you guys are too this is just not to
brag if you guys are sharing this with
me like I wouldn't be doing this if it
wasn't for you guys I wouldn't want to
be living on my own at this age if it
wasn't for my position you know like I'm
not gonna address the heat to it because
I usually could but it doesn't make
sense I'm someone that likes to live in
the now and do what I want and just see
what happens in life I think the way we
live our life is kind of stupid not to
I'm not stupid but you know like it's
very laid out for us and I don't agree
with that I like to make my own life in
my own path and not you know follow
every system of the government and the
world has trained us to do I'm on a rant
fully but let me know any videos you
guys want to see here because there's so
much more I can't do it I'm so excited
something you did in 2017 you won't do
in 2018 law a lot like a lot oh why
there is so much I could say to this
question because oh boy 2017 was the
year of learning like learning and
seeing just everything for its true
colors I guess like I like to give
people the benefit of the doubt but I
realized not everyone deserves it so I'm
gonna be really careful with like who I
trust his fear and things like that like
I'm just tired of getting hurt and
thinking about like stuff that I don't
need to think about and takes up so much
of in my mind space but like in five
years like it really
won't matter and look what am i doing I
want to leave that aspect of like over
thinking about people and situations and
things that I literally cannot change
one thing you want to accomplish this
year one thing I really want to
accomplish that I don't want to talk too
much about because I don't jinx it
/ give too much away but stuff around
fashion and clothing and mean putting it
out for other people like not merch but
you'll see I have such a clear vision in
mind and I want to make it a reality and
I'm working really hard right now to do
so so stay tuned I'm excited to work out
all the stuff that I've been wanting to
work on and finally can I just want 2018
to just be crying here like I want to be
grinding someone asks what's one thing
you left in 2017 by the way I love you
and I love you too
something I left in 2017 I guess people
that I've just finally seen their true
colors that I don't buy with it or the
part of me that care too much I guess
you know I want to care for people in a
healthy way and not in a way that like
destroys you emotionally that's multiple
things that left in 2017 and I'm hoping
2018 is our year the best year I need a
cough drop oh my god for your thoughts
on the whole Logan Paul situation and do
you have any advice for someone who has
been affected by this kind of situation
love you I love you too and I don't want
to talk a lot about Logan pause I just
don't want to even bring attention to
this whole situation the one piece of
advice I can give to Logan would be to
delete his channel honestly because that
feels great enough money
he's not even in YouTube for the right
reasons you can just tell it's videos
it's like that video made me sick to my
stomach the only thing I could say about
that is nobody who has a heart could put
that video out oh no
suicide is a scary scary topic it's
scary it's sad it's not something to
joke about whatsoever it's not something
to even mention like that in a video
like just I don't know you can't take
that lightly by whom that you've got
your name this program grammar and then
she said is there a chance you could be
on me and yes of course I got you after
I found this my grandpa gave me my name
um the one that I want to get a tattoo
in honor of he named me melody joy so
sad I ran for my name what do you want
to change in your life in 2018 I think
this is gonna be the last question just
cuz I don't know I like and get on like
a positive note and I personally want
2018 to be the most positive year for me
and just you know everyone like the
people I love in the world
the world needs positivity at this point
I honestly really just want to like live
my life see different places just see
more of the world and kind of get out of
my little bubble of where I am every day
I don't know there's a lot of what I do
in 2018 my camp is about a guy and I
think I answered a pretty good question
so I hope you guys enjoyed this Q&amp;amp;A and
got to see what was going on in my life
what's new just a little personal time
my voice sounds terrible what is
happening I'm gonna go but I love you
guys
to infinity and beyond I mean it when I
say it and I hope you know that and I
hope you're having a marvelous runnin
afternoon or night and I'll hopefully
see your beautiful face in my next video
deuces B I'll let you take it back right
see energy this is like ah I know a lot
of people do know me for drinking energy
drinks but this one is why I'm handsome
so can be the dole thing is hard bro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
