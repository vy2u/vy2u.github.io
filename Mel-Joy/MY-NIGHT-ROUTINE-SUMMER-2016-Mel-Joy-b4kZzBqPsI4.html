not listening no I'm in there for me
Julie I ain't got no business here but
since my friends are here I just came to
kick it overly I would rather be at home
so hey guys it's me Mel and today's
video is gonna be a night routine and
pretty much in the summer I'll do
whatever I do during the day and then at
night I will spend some time on my
laptop there I was just responding to
comments you know catching up on my
YouTube and everything and then I head
to my bathroom and I take off my makeup
so here I'm just taking off all my
makeup but I don't want to get it on my
jacket so you know I unzipped it I'm
taking off my fake eyelashes and I'm
using my Neutrogena Oh No
or is it CVS it's either CVS or
Neutrogena like oil free eye makeup
remover and this thing is amazing it
gets everything off so I just use that
and then after I have a clean face I
decided to take a bath tonight
and I'm using a lush bath bomb I've been
saving you to use this for so long
it's the galaxy one so I was like super
pumped and I just have my water and then
this is cereal ant with soy milk of
course and soy ice cream and it's so
good if you guys have never tried it you
have to try it just like cereal and ice
cream yeah anyway so I'm just putting
the bath um in and it looked so sick I
love baths I also just set up Netflix
you know when I was just watching
Netflix and taking a bath and it was a
time and this is so relaxing I love this
to just wind down from my day so I'm
doing that and I'm looking at the pretty
blue water so then after I'm done with
my bath the first thing I need to do is
put on music because I love listening to
music this is my Spotify it smell joy so
I'm just you know dancing having a good
time there's always supposed to be a
good mood I just I love music so then
I'm doing my whole skin care stuff this
isn't a full skin care routine this is
just what I do want to chill night so I
take my Proactiv just cleanser I don't
do the whole Proactiv thing or anything
like that but I really like this
cleanser and I've seen that it helps
with my breakouts and everything and
this is like an exfoliant and I love
that so I just do that to my face and
then I wash it off um so yeah and then
make sure to pat your face dry don't rub
that and then after that I'm using my
Clinique moisturizer this is my
hands-down favorite moisturizer ever so
I'm just applying this I apply this
every morning and every night I love
this stuff so I'm just applying that all
over my face and don't forget about your
eyebrows and your eyelids um and then
I'm taking my toothpaste on my
toothbrush and I'm just brushing my
teeth and then as I do that I'm just
looking at your guys's comments
responding looking at Instagram Twitter
all that stuff and also dancing because
you know many dance party um and yeah so
don't forget to brush your tongue do and
then I'm taking my floss because
flossing is very important and I get
cavities really easily so you know don't
want those so I'm just pausing my teeth
then I'm doing my crest 3d white strips
I just recently started using these but
I like them so far so yeah what I've
been doing is just putting on and then
you let them sit for 30
minutes and I usually just do it at
night because I can just chill and watch
Netflix and do YouTube stuff as the 30
minutes is going so I set my timer right
there and then I got all comfortable in
my bed I absolutely love just laying in
my bed and chilling at the end of the
day it is the best feeling um like this
video if you guys agree so I just do
that and I'm just chilling on my
computer doing whatever for 30 minutes
you know also on my phone on both
because you know so after the timer goes
off it's you know darker outside because
it's been 30 minutes and I cannot bring
my phone and I get up and I go to the
bathroom and I take them off because you
don't want to leave these on for too
long or I don't know they might damage
your teeth I don't know I don't even
want to know but so I just rinse my
mouth make sure it's all gone
then I take my castor oil because if you
guys didn't know I took off my eyelash
extensions and I'm not happy with my
eyelashes so I want them to grow and be
thicker and better so I'm just putting
that on my lash line just to help them
grow overnight I do this every night now
to help them grow so then when I come
back I'm drinking water because I love
drinking water and I take my Carmex and
I apply this on my lips generously
because you know I'm just let this sit
on my lips as I sleep and then I take my
skin fix hand cream and I also apply
this to my hands because I hate the
feeling of dry hands like I cannot stand
it so I just put that on then I also
take my Vaseline aloe lotion I usually
actually do this right after I get out
of the bath bay forgot so I'm just
applying this all over my body and then
I'm shutting my laptop and plugging it
in and you know just casually jumping in
a bit because everyone does this every
single night no just kidding
um but yeah I am turning off the light
with my step pig so yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did make sure
to give it a thumbs up I'll be
so so much I love you to infinity and
beyond and I hope you're having a
marvelous morning afternoon or night
deuces yeah get that nasty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
