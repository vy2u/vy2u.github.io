are you guys I hope you're doing good
it's been a minute it's been a minute
before we start this video I wanted to
do a little rant because you know me so
what I do I just wanted to talk about
why I was a little absent on YouTube for
a little while and why I wasn't posting
videos consistently it wasn't that long
was just for a little bit and also
really quickly I just did my route so I
have like hair dye all around my scalp
so if that looks really wack I'm sorry
it takes a couple days to wash out so
it's literally just like dye on my
forehead honestly the reason I took a
little time off was to focus on me and
there's times I just feel like in a funk
and I feel lost and I feel like what do
I want to do with my life how do I want
to live my life every day and I was in
one of those little moods I was thinking
a lot about like my youtube and what I
wanted it to be and things like that
just cuz I feel like YouTube has changed
a lot over the time of when I started
doing it so that's why we are here with
no studio lights I'm chillin I don't
know I just want to make my youtube
channel a lot more chill and like hey
this is my life what's up and I just
think I got too caught up in like the
production of it and I realize like no
like what matters is me and my videos
and things like that
I just miss like 2013 YouTube and that's
what I want my videos to be like if that
makes sense
so there might be chill values like this
where I'm just sitting by a window with
my messy room in my background or like
more high quality videos with all my
studio lights and setup background you
know so I just like it depends how I
feel and what I want to do for that week
and things like that but I hope you guys
understand it's not because I hate what
I do I love what I do it's just
sometimes everyone needs a break and
they just need to really focus on them
that's my number one piece of advice I
could give to anyone sometimes it's good
to just isolate yourself for a little
bit and really just take some time to
yourself to figure out all the thoughts
in your head and to live your best life
from them if that makes sense so yeah
but today's video is just gonna be like
my quick easy everyday makeup I used to
cake my face back in the day like a lot
if you watch my old videos I feel like I
just don't even look like the same
person but I've realized over time that
less is more
that's why I wanted to show you guys my
updated makeup routine this is just the
makeup I've been doing over the past
couple of mom
weeks I just got really comfortable with
myself with no makeup on I feel like so
I'm just all about trying to enhance my
natural features and not take my face to
the max if that makes sense a hundred
percent I would recommend taking time
off with makeup too because the time
that I took a break I wasn't really
wearing a lot of makeup and you just get
to like get comfortable with who you are
as who you are if that makes sense I
feel like every video I post is like a
little deep aspect to it like no that's
just that's what's been going on and
also if you know to my channel what is
up my name is Mel it is great to meet
you you already know I would appreciate
it if you hit that subscribe button and
also click the little notification Mel
button if you want to be notified every
time I post a video I do respond to
early comments on every video so I'll be
right there honestly if you're watching
this when I just posted it I'll be in
the comments so I think I've talked
enough I've said enough so if you want
to see how to get this look my everyday
quick easy natural just what I want to
do when I want to look a little bit more
put together and just stay tuned and
keep watching roll the clip
first thing I always do is put my hair
up because you don't want makeup in your
hair it's gross and it's just not cute I
just I don't want to put effort into my
button I've been such a weird mood I
don't know if I should be filming right
now you know what that's the best time
to film so we're gonna start with primer
I honestly switch off between my
Smashbox photo finish primer Iser
and this is a primer slash moisturizer
which is dope because I don't like
having dry skin and I just I'm not a fan
but I'll either use this or just my Mac
primer um those have been my favorites
recently and I just put that all over my
face like you would with lotion
so after primer we go and go in where is
it after primer I'm gonna go in with my
L'Oreal infallible makeup extender
setting spray spray it all over my face
where's my thing I use a random thing
and I just I fan it and I kind of just
like make sure it's all set these are my
Holy Grail foundations BB cream whatever
you want to call them I sounds sick why
do I sound sick I use the CC cream
it's anti-aging so I'm gonna look 5
again I mix the colors medium and light
when I have a tan on
which I do kind of I'm like pale I'm
pale okay
so we're gonna take medium first because
that's like when I mostly match and then
I do like a couple pumps like that I'm
gonna mix a little light with it and
then I just do a couple pumps of the
light not as much and I just mix that on
my hand like so I need to look here and
not here hey how are you so I'm just
gonna put little lines all over my face
I do this sometimes I just I don't know
and then I take my Smashbox blurring
foundation brush I believe yeah I do
like circular motion slash little lines
just like make sure it's blended and
that my hair oh I forgot to do my
eyebrows oh my god I usually do my
eyebrows first because foundation does
not make my eyebrows look good like if I
get foundation in them and then I do my
eyebrows so Rick I'm just gonna do a
foundation really quickly and then do my
eyebrows so let's hope for the best
but I pretty much just put this all over
my face and blend it down the neck just
the basic foundation stuff you feel me
but I don't like doing too much of this
I just want like one sheer coat I've
like really been into wearing less
makeup than more makeup it's just it's a
thing I have a pimple right here that
like refuses to get covered and when
that happens I just kind of say okay and
I let my pimple show through because
pimples are a thing they occur and they
suck but whatever I always have way too
much left on my hand so make sure to use
less than more less is more I really
only do one layer I used to cake the kid
on like it was I don't know oh my god so
now we're gonna do brows because I
forgot to do them so I'm just gonna
brush through them
and make sure there's no foundation and
then I do my eyebrows a lot darker than
my natural eyebrow because I dyed my
hair like black and I'm usually a blog
so they just don't match like it's not
bad but I just I want them darker you
feel me I just try to fill it in
wherever there's like the sparse issed
areas of sparsit's like I focused most
of the product towards the end because I
want like the fade effect like I want it
to look less filled in and then more
filled in this takes just so much focus
every day I feel like my eyebrows are
different it just gets to a point where
I give up
with my eyebrows and we're at that point
so once we got the brows on and we like
them do we like them I usually like do
my brows and then once I do all my
makeup I like perfect them at the end
the next thing I usually do is I shadow
so I can like fix my eye shadow with
concealer after so recently I've been
obsessed with the bye-bye under-eye
concealer from a cosmetics
I used to make up as complicated you
really have to find your right shade I
mix light and medium just like I do with
the foundation I'm just gonna use this
for my eyelids to get rid of any veins
and all that jazz I literally just put
that all over my lid up to my eyebrow
then I'm just taking my ELF sheer powder
it's like the High Definition powder or
something and I've actually been into
this recently I just pack this onto my
eyelids to set the concealer so we'll be
ready for the eyeshadows I've been using
the pure soul ray Diaries I can't sue
day I don't know it's pure swears rash
Diaries yeah I should take another
language bad luck for seven years I've
done it a million times so I'm obsessed
with the colors I think they're so
pretty so I'm just gonna take the color
private party which is like neutral
matte whatever and I'm just gonna put
that all over my lid to be like the base
color I'm a beauty guru if you want like
a quick quick look I would just say take
one of these colors and just put it in
your crease and go out the door but I
like to spend a little bit more time if
I'm like filming or taking photos or
something and I just like want to look
my best
you know but I take the color gala which
is like just a really light brown and I
just blend that into my crease wait I'm
gonna move you closer but this is like
almost a transition color because it's a
super super light brown and a life AK I
do too is I go like this and then I'll
just do the crease like right above so
it like flatters your eye shape does
that make sense I don't know it's just
it really matches like the crease I feel
like and it helps me get the creases
more even and then I'm just gonna go in
with the color splurge it's all very
warm toned which I like though I like
warm toned colors for my eyes and I'm
just gonna then focus this in the outer
V
and blend it into my crease to add
definition and darkness like the color
is freaked up so that's the eyes I just
feel like it's warm it's natural it just
adds something but it's not like crazy
if you know what I mean I need to look
hi I'm about to turn this off so then
I'm gonna go in with the same like
mixture of concealer and we're gonna do
just the under eyes I use my finger for
warmth honestly and then with the
concealer I'll make the like wing kind
of like the wing effect with the eye
shadow just because I like it I think it
looks flattering for my eye type I don't
know and then I just put some wherever I
just want a little extra coverage
forehead chin all that stuff even though
it's under eye concealer multi-purpose
right this pimple is just not gonna get
covered and I already know it but I'll
try and that's as much I'll try so then
I'm just gonna go back in with the same
elf powder and just set my under eyes
this makes or breaks the look honestly I
love it I just this powder bro and then
I'm just gonna also put this powder
everywhere else but with just a powder
foundation but I just like I like the
shape of it and I like how it packs the
powder into my face I've just been doing
this like lightly all over my face so I
don't like caked but I also don't look
oily now we're gonna bronze up the face
because we looking a little pasty what
if Ida knows this small ready okay I
take my Rimmel maxi bronzer in light and
it just has these three colors and I
kind of mix them / this one's my
favorite oh and I just put more I want
to be bronzed and contoured so like
cheekbones forehead always got to do the
jawline make it look cut oh I'm really
into like building like I start with
less and I'll do more cuz I used to just
pound that down also sometimes be like
this to blend the concealer with the
bronzer I don't know if that's a great
idea but it works for me it depends the
day and how much bronzer I'm trying to
do then I just kind of go in where I
want like the bronzer not to be I feel
like I'm just trying to use random words
to make sense but like does it work
honestly I'll take any brush like around
me I'm just gonna use a blending
eyeshadow
but I'm gonna contour my nose oh god I
either do a really good contoured nose
or a really bad contoured nose I just
put it under and then here to make my
nose just well I don't know I don't know
I just kind of go like on the sides of
my nose I forgot to show this but I put
the powder on my neck as well to set it
I usually just go in with like the small
brush I was using earlier with powder
and I just kind of put the powder where
I don't want the contour because I'm
trying to I don't know so then I just
take my master precise skinny eye liner
by Maybelline and I just put this on my
top lashline to like make my lashes look
oh my god I just hope you have it okay I
can't talk while I do this but I put it
on my top lash line uh-huh just to make
my lashes look darker and thicker and
all that stuff good huh sometimes it's
just woo the L'Oreal voluminous lash is
one of my favorite mascaras the tube is
pretty much out I'm just gonna go in
with this honestly and just see what we
can do pretty much the only technique I
could say hi I like go back and forth
like this and then I brush them up I
just like I love the look of long
eyelashes so that's always what I'm
trying to do my eyelashes look good but
I just want more I want more then I just
take my clump crusher mascara from
covergirl this just adds so much to the
lashes I go on top of them like I brush
on top of them to add like another layer
to the top sometimes it can get too
clumpy and yeah I did get mascara on my
eyelids but we will fix that in a sec I
just I don't want it too clumpy but I do
want my eyelashes like bad they're there
and they're here to party one of my
biggest life hacks I feel like for this
is just to take a spoolie and get rid of
the dried stuff and then I also will
sometimes comb through them or like take
tweezers for the bottom I just take the
same L'Oreal paradise mascara just apply
that to the bottom lashes sometimes I'll
do like a lot of under eye mascara but I
feel like that's more of like a
I don't know look and it's just not as
chill and natural just depends my day
but I wanted natural lashes today then
I'm taking my Mac extra dimension
skinfinish I always mess that up I would
say what did I say not dimension I'd say
extra diminish I said that in so many of
my videos like if you go back I I said
that so I just take this on my pinky and
just put it at the very tip of my nose I
take the precise highlighting brush from
Smashbox and I just put a little bit of
highlighter on the top of my cheekbone I
don't like to use too much highlighter
because I used to use so much
highlighter I would pack it on just cuz
I wanted to like have that glow but I
ended up looking so oily and it was just
not cute so we keep it natural now so
the last thing I do is I take my ELF
what is this it doesn't say on it but
it's like a wax stick and I use it to
set my eyebrows because it's not like
gross and sticky like some gels I don't
know it's just personal opinion then I'm
just gonna take the same setting spray I
used at the beginning and I'm just gonna
spray it all over my face to set my
makeup all day because I don't I don't
want it coming off it just what's the
point of doing it if it's gonna come off
I need my thing we got the thing oh my
god and I just oh fan it into my face I
think that's it so thank you guys so
