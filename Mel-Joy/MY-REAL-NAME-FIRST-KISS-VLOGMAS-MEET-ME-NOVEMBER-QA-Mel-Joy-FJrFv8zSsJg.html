going to be a Q &amp;amp; A I want to apologize
for the background it's literally so
boring my regular background it's having
some difficulties I don't have my
current or anything right now cuz it's
getting hemmed but I really need to film
this video and I literally went around
my whole house looking for places to
film this one ended up being the best to
know what we're just gonna roll with it
I hope it doesn't bother you guys too
much
earlier today I uploaded a photo on
Instagram if you guys don't follow my
Instagram it's Mel underscore joy with
three wise yeah one line was taken and
you guys asked me some questions and
today I'm just going to be answering
them because I have been kind of m.i.a
recently I'm sorry for that it's just
because the past week or so I've just
had a lot to do I've had a lot of
homework I've had basketball tryouts
which take up two hours a day I also
have to balance my social life my school
life I've asked for a life you to life
it's just like I don't know and I've
been having trouble balancing recently
I'm trying to jump back into the swing
of things and trying to balance it again
but I'm sorry but I'm back and I just
wanted to do this type of video where I
kind of just sit down and talk to you
guys because I haven't done a Q&amp;amp;A in
three months I believe and I just wanted
you guys to kind of know what's new with
me everything that's going on and I
thought a Q&amp;amp;A would be the best way to
do that so I'm just going to answer some
questions that you guys asked me I have
not picked any questions this is going
to be completely happening right now

asked what's your advice to people being
bullied and I love you I love you too
and my advice to people being bullied is
to count your blessings think of all the
good things in your life try not to
focus on the negative things sure I
think that everything will be better in
the future
stand up for yourself that's like a hard
thing to do but if you build up that
confidence back at health the main act
of bullying is jealousy maybe they're
just jealous of you
