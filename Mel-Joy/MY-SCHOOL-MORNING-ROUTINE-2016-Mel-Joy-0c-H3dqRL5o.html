5:30 my first alarm goes off to get
ready for school in the morning but of
course I snooze that I am terrible
waking up when I set an alarm so I sent
multiple before I have to get up this
next one was at 5:45 um and then I just
use it again and then the last one is at
6:00 and I actually set ones for after
this in case I sleep through this one
but yeah I end up getting out of bed at
6:00 so what I'm doing here is I'm just
grabbing my phone turning off the alarm
looking real cute and I'm just turning
off all the other alarms that I had said
there's like five of them and then here
I'm just checking the weather so I know
if my outfit I planned the night before
is good for that day and I'm checking on
my social media just to wake me up a bit
and then I finally set up and decide to
get moving so the first thing I do is I
opened my drapes and this definitely
house wake me up so here I'm just kind
of covering my eyes cuz you know it's
bright and then I'm stumbling like a
zombie to my bathroom and this is the
first thing I do in the morning of
course I use the restroom I didn't show
that though but then I am just yet doing
that thing because I don't wanna go to
school but I am just putting up my hair
so just put it in a bun just to get all
of my hair out of my face
I'm also show you guys my really cute
acne cream that I had from the night
before I took out my retainer and now I
am brushing my teeth with my crest
whitening toothpaste and my electronic
toothbrush and I do the full two minutes
because I want those pearly whites you
can't forget about the tongue in the
roof your mouth so now I am washing my
face with my morning burst facial
cleanser this just helps me wake up in
the morning it feels really nice on your
skin so I just apply that all over my
face and I just
massage it into my face all that good
stuff and then I just rinsed it off with
warm water because I cannot put cold
water on my face in the morning even
though it helps wake you up it just it's
too cold so I just Pat my face dry and
yeah and then I go back into my room I
turn on all my lights and I change from
my PJs to the outfit I play in the night
but for I love planning my outfit the
night before just sort of not to stress
in the morning so this is just what I'm
wearing pretty chill and then I'm
opening my laptop to play some music
while I do my makeup so here I'm just
doing my makeup but I'm not going to
show you guys because I just posted my
everyday makeup routine so if you guys
want to see that I will link it here and
the link will be down below but this is
my everyday makeup so if you want to see
that she'll do that and then I'm
applying my perfume and body mist and of
course having a little dance party with
myself with the perfume and then I am
just doing my hair my hair was looking
at not really cute that day so I decided
to just put it into braids I usually
either straighten it I'll straighten it
the night before so I don't have to in
the morning but I didn't do that and my
hair was pretty not straight so I just
decided to put it in two braids because
it's really cute lazy day hairstyle and
I thought it would be easy and it's one
of my faves so that's my hair and then
also when my little tricks is to wear a
hat to school to help cover the crazy
hair so I showed you guys that because I
was going to wear that but I didn't end
up wearing that and then I got my shoes
put those on and this is my outfit of
the day my jeans are from American Eagle
my top is from H&amp;amp;M tank top forever 21
she was adidas backpack North Face and
I'm telling you guys to come with me and
I also turned off the lights make sure
to do that in the morning guys you don't
always power
so I set my backpack down went
downstairs and since my parents are the
best people ever
they made me my breakfast I prepared my
coffee overnight this was just an iced
coffee they usually make me warm one in
the morning because you guys know me I
gotta have my morning coffee and then
this is just a really healthy breakfast
it has like everything you need in a
meal it's so good and I love breakfast
it's one my favorite parts of the day
and after I'm done eating I just open
the door and I Drive myself to school so
yeah that was my school morning routine
