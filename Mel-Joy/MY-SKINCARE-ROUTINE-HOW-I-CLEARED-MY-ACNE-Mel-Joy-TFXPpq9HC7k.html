are you doing I hope you doing great
today's video is going to be one of my
most requested videos actually and if
you're new to my channel what is up my
name is mouth I would really appreciate
it if you hit that subscribe button down
below and I fee you know where it is
click the subscribe button with your
pinky toe oh my god mouth or your nose I
was gonna say nose and then I was like
let's be weird I've been waiting a
really long time to do this video until
I was like a hundred percent sure of
everything then I was gonna say and like
telling you guys like the right
information and what helped me and I
didn't want to tell you wrong stuff you
feel me I just really wanted to make
sure before I film this video that I
know my heater come on my heater just
turned on so ignore that I turned it off
but it takes a second to turn off I have
just been through a whirlwind like oh my
god when it comes to my skin I have been
through ups and downs and I just felt so
insecure about my skin and I don't want
anyone feeling like that and I'm just
I'm really happy that I actually you
know cleared up my skin and I figured
out what worked best for my skin I don't
even know if I have oily or combination
or dry I think it's I think it's
combination but I don't know there were
times where my skin was literally like
flaking off of my face because like I
was just using so many acne products to
try to get rid of my acne and then it
would just dry the Frick out of my face
like it was so bad I'll insert before
photos of my skin here most of it was on
the sides of my face my forehead a big
one it was just mostly like right there
yeah
my skin feels so smooth now like when I
read couch it like I'm like yeah she's
like how did I get here I don't know but
I'm happy about it like I love touching
my face don't do that don't touch your
face it's bad for your skin
it'll make you break out like I feel
like my skin feels like a baby's butt
now and that's that was just not the
situation before without further ado it
you want to see how I cleared up my skin
/ what my skincare routine is currently
and then stay tuned and keep watching
roll the clip
I'm really hoping this is in focus so
I'm back to do my skincare routine in
the morning and I did work up I just
woke up and I thought well no I didn't
think I planned to show you guys my
morning skincare routine and my night
skincare routine so I thought I would
start in the morning so here we are
morning I would say my morning routine
is probably the most simple Oh in the
morning I actually don't use any like
acne products on my face just because if
I go outside like your skin is really
sensitive to light and with acne
products on your face like I don't know
I use all the acne products at nighttime
and then more of like the cleansing and
the whatever and moisturizing in the
morning there's a couple of face washes
actually that I would go in with in the
morning I will either use this L'Oreal
pure clay cleanser and it's a purified
mattifier I like this because it really
mattifies your face so it's good for
like if you want to do your makeup right
after and you want having that face you
feel me and it just like removes dirt
oil and all that stuff and I like clay
things like I don't know I'm just known
as clay cleanser as clay masks
everything like that works really well
on my skin so yeah also when you're
washing your face try not to put too
much pressure on your fingertips to keep
it like light that's what I've read
about and researched I don't know if I
want to do more of like a fireman
replenishing my skin I don't know what
I'm saying
but I use this vitamin C facial wash my
soap &amp;amp; Glory vitamin C is like so so so
good for your skin I'll use this not
everyday I'll switch it between this one
yeah sometimes in the morning if my face
is really really dry I want to use an
exfoliator and I like to use the Kate
Somerville exfoliate it's just this
little one I think I'm gonna find the
big one after I'm done with this but
this has lasted me so long because it's
like an intense treatment you only put
like a pea-sized amount you put it all
over your skin you
there's like a minute or two it's
literally like a facial like it says
Hollywood's two minute facial like it's
not lying like I feel like I have a
facial after I exfoliate my skin with it
is to finish off pretty much it sounds
simple because it is my morning routine
is simple before I start my day I will
go in with the Lubriderm daily
moisturizer and I love this my
dermatologist recommended it to me I
don't think there's any bad oils in it
and things like that I don't know it
doesn't have any scent it's just like
plain lotion which is like just good for
your face like keep it simple you feel
talking about night routine that's a
different story at night of course I
will always take off whatever makeup I
have on I just really use whatever face
makeup remover I have I've gone through
so many like Clinique's Neutrogena
whatever so now I'm on to the Mac that
we off wipes they take your makeup off
super easily but it doesn't like tear at
your face I don't know what I'm saying
okay when I first started breaking out
my dermatologist recommended what was it
it was a 5% benzoyl peroxide acne wash
so if your skin is like really breaking
out right now I would recommend that you
can get it over the counter
anything with benzoyl peroxide there is
benzoyl peroxide it Susilo casted and a
ton of other like acne things benzoyl
peroxide cleared up my skin so much my
skin cleared up enough where I felt like
I didn't need to use that face wash
anymore and it was just really drying
out my skin so I go in with the
Neutrogena all-in-one acne control daily
scrub this only has 2% Susilo Casas so
it's a little less than the 5 percent
for benzoyl peroxide they're different
things I new hope of making that clear I
am NOT asking professional person at all
I know I a lot of dermatologists say not
to exfoliate every day and I have some
friends who exploit every day and my
skin's like so good so I'm like torn
between it so if I don't want to
exfoliate that night I'll probably just
use one of the other face washes or this
exfoliator is bomb as hell again the
L'Oreal pure clay cleanser but it's an
exfoliator and I'll sometimes go in with
this at night if I don't want to use my
acne
and my skin isn't breaking out but a
scope break out so I would probably use
that today the benzoyl peroxide 5% that
I used was not an exfoliator and I have
where is it I have I have similar things
to this but not exfoliator for if I just
don't want to itch away my skin and make
it more raw hmmm to go in after that I
use of course the same lotion but I also
go in with this oh my god I made a bunch
of this clindamycin phosphate and
benzoyl peroxide gel this you have to
get from your doctor or steal it from a
friend it's getting up kidding I get it
one of my friends my if you're watching
is shout out to you because oh my god
Ramola
like this I don't know I love this it's
one point 2 / 5 percent so I think it's
the same as a face wash I just put this
on any breakouts like a thin layer and
rub it in and then in the morning like I
don't know bro this just changed my life
so you can see the tube is like gone and
I still use it occasionally for the
breakouts
I just don't like to overdo it on my
skin anymore because I really think I
did and I think that actually made my
breakouts worse in the end also I wanted
to talk about this glam glow mask it's
the super mud clearing treatment mask it
will dry your skin out but it dries your
breakouts out and like I'll put it on a
pimple leave it on for 5 to 20 minutes
and by the time I take it off it'll look
less bright bless
toughy whatever it I'm just like where
did this come from if you need a
cleaning mask get your hands on this bad
boy
because whoa she fired she is straight
fire I think oh my god is that the end
of my skincare routine I think it is I
mean I really quickly just want to say
that what really cleared up my skin was
the fact that I I did it every day you
know I did everything every day I made
sure I didn't skip a night of my acne
treatment or whatever and it's just all
about being consistent drinking a ton of
water and I mean as much water as you
can without overdosing because that's
the thing I've done it once yeah I was
over hydrated that was crazy
that was weird so I think I think that's
it with the skincare role the app show
me I hope you guys

below any other videos you want to see I
mean love you guys to infinity and
