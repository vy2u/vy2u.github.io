drop my backpack and I open my laptop I
log into YouTube Twitter Tumblr those
type of things just check on my social
media and Here I am editing a video and
then I just sit on my phone I talked to
my friends go on social media go on any
apps I want to and now I'm realizing
that I'm pretty hungry so I go and I get
some baked chips and I like these
because they're a lot healthier for you
than the other chips and here I'm also
taking a peach because fruits really
good for you
and then I got some water and water is
great for you so remember to drink it
and here I just brought my sweatpants
from pink because honestly who likes to
wear tight pants I'm gonna put on my
comfy slippers from Target and now it's
time for homework I was just doing my
math homework because it was due the
next day and here I'm actually filming a
video
and then I'm starting my workout on the
pump club app I don't workout every day
but today felt like working out and I
just did my 15-minute workout but I'm
not going to show you the whole thing so
here's just a little sneak preview and
if you want to workout routine like this
video and comment down below so next I
go to my bathroom and I just take off
all my makeup and I'm going to show you
how I do that so first I put my hair up
to get all my hair out of my face
and then I take my CVS oil-free makeup
remover and I love this stuff and I just
put this on a little cotton pad and take
off all my makeup after my makeup I wash
my face with a st. Ives
peach exfoliating scrub and I love this
I use it every day it makes your skin
feel so refreshed and now I'm just
rubbing it in
and I'm just washing it off sometimes if
I feel like it I use my Dead Sea mineral
anti-stress clay mask and I'll just put
that on my face for 15 minutes or I'll
use my shine control cleansing gel from
Garn yang and now I'm just brushing my
teeth and I'm using my 3d white crest
toothpaste to brush my teeth with my
electronic toothbrush
and while I brush my teeth I kind of
just think about life and how my day
went and what I want to do tomorrow and
etc and now I'm just using my glide Pro
health loss and I'm just flossing my
teeth because I have dealt with cavities
and they stink so make sure to brush and
floss twice a day and now I'm just
drinking some water and now I'm starting
my shower
I don't shower every night but when I
shower this is the stuff I use your
shampoo conditioner all that jazz and
I've been obsessed with putting my hand
French braids after take a shower to
make my hair curly the next day and now
I'm just taking my retainer I actually
use this retainer sort of grind my teeth
in the night because grinding your teeth
is bad and now I changed it to my
pajamas I just have those cute owl
pajamas and now I'm picking out my
outfit for the next day so I don't have
to spend like 30 minutes the next day
picking it out and this is a striped
dress from forever 21 and a black top
from Tilly's because it was really cold
and now I'm taking my Vaseline in my EOS
lip-balm and mint and I'm just applying
this to my lips I am then taking out
anything from my backpack I don't need
for the next day and I'm putting it
things I do need for the next day and
this is my personal favorite just laying
in bed and relaxing and now I'm going on
my phone just checking everything and
then I'm plugging in my phone and I'm
going to bed
so thank you guys so much for watching
I'll see you in my next video hey
I am L yes we can remind if you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
