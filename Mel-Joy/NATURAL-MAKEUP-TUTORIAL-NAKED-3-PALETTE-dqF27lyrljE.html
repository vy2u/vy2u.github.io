to be doing a tutorial with the naked 3
palette I mentioned this in my 16th
birthday haul a lot of you guys asked
for tutorial using it I tried to be more
of a natural look because this is
personally something that I would wear
on an everyday basis I thought that it
would be helpful for you guys to see
that in this video I decided to talk as
I do my makeup and kind of explain it to
you guys and it's like I'm you know kind
of talking you guys more than I'm
voiceover but if you guys prefer a
voiceover you can let me know
constructive criticism I tried to keep
it natural if you guys want a more
dramatic look you can let me know down
below too and I'll make sure to do that
for you guys this is kind of like a
natural everyday fall any season makeup
look and if you guys liked it let me
know and also before I start this video
I really quickly wanted to thank you all
for 100,000 subscribers I hit it the
other day um and it's just I know it's
insane to me that a hundred thousand of
you guys are supporting me and watching
my videos and subscribed to me that's
honestly insane and personally I never
thought that I would get this far on
YouTube when I started YouTube I did not
expect this at all and it feels amazing
and I'm so grateful for you guys and
lucky to have you guys and it means so
much to me there's going to be a
separate video on this I'm going to be
doing a hundred thousand subscriber
giveaway so stay tuned for that but I
really quickly wanted to thank you guys
and I love you all so much so let's get
back to the video so if you guys want to
see how to get this look stay tuned and
keep watching so once I'm done with my
face makeup I am taking my scandalize
Rimmel London eyeshadow crayon here's
our two bulletproof page I'm applying
this to my lid as a base but why I like
this is because it's shimmery so it'll
hold your eyeshadows all day but also
has shimmer to them which I really like
I'm just doing this to both sides
I'm also focusing this on the inner
corner of my eyelid so once I'm done
with that I'm going in with the Naked 3
palette I'm taking the color dust and I
am taking my Ecotools shadow brush I'm
applying this all
the lid lightly and once I'm done with
that I'm taking the color iron out right
there and putting this on the second
half of my eyelid like so and then I'm
taking the color limit I'm putting this
in my crease and don't worry we're going
to blend it in a second so does it
matter if it's messy or not and a my
ecotools blending brush I'm blending
that in and this is just gonna help to
find your crease we're going to take the
color trip which is this a pretty
goldish brownish color I'm going to put
this kind of on the middle of my eyelid
to give it some dimension
and then I'm taking nooner which is a
matte brown color and I am putting this
in my crease also this is just going to
help darken up the look now we're gonna
blend
and I'm taking the color strange which
is pretty much a white matte color light
pink and I play next on my brow bone to
help define them brows and also in the
inner corner of my eye
and putting it also onto my eyelid a
little bit this helps you look more
awake yeah and I just really like that
step blending a little bit there's no
harsh lines to finish the look off I'm
taking taking the color factory which is
like a dark brown shimmery color and I'm
putting this to my outer-v to really
define my eye and make it look a little
bit darker and also blend it into the
crease a little bit and I'm just gonna
blend that I also decided to just take
dust again the colors at the beginning
and put this in my inner corner as well
and I just really like inner corner
highlights and I'm done with the eye
shadow now moving on to eyeliner I'm
taking my ELF waterproof eyeliner pen
and I'm lining my top eyelid with
eyeliner I'm doing its both sides I like
using cran eyeliner better because I
feel like it looks more natural than
liquid eyeliner and then I'm also going
to do my tight line and my lower
waterline
and I'm going to slightly extend the top
eyeliner on to Wayne but just to extend
my eye shade so that's the eyeliner I
love mascara
I'm taking my celly Anson eyelash curler
and I'm just curling my lashes and I
curl my eyelashes until they're as cold
as I like them and then once I'm done
with that I'm taking my Hypnose drama
mascara ignore the gross news it's from
Lancome I'm going to apply this to my
top and bottom lashes as you can do one
coat a tip for you guys is what I do for
my mascara I do one coat on the top of
my lashes which you have to be careful
about getting it on your eyelid just
gotta do your best
I'm taking my they're real mascara I
really like to wear multiple coats of
mascara so I'm just doing one coat of
this as well forgot to do my bottom
lashes with the Lancome I did that real
quick and then some through there real I
think I'm going to do one more coat of
this
I'm also just putting some liner on my
bottom lash line so I think that is it
for the eyes now I just moisturize my
lips with my EOS but now I'm seeing my
Kate Spade lipstick in 0-8 by Rimmel
London looks like this I'm just dabbing
some lips to complete the look but
they're down so this is the finished
look I'm definitely not an expert up
these eyeshadows yet but I thought I
would give it a shot and show you guys
something that I would wear so as you
can tell I already had my face done up I
guess um when I started the video if you
guys want to see a foundation routine or
face makeup routine let me know down
below and I can do that for you guys or
an everyday makeup routine so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video
the guys so much for watching and see
you in my next one I love you guys so so
much thank you again for a hundred
thousand you guys mean you guys mean so
much to me bye guys hey guys so today's
video is going to be a 16th birthday
haul and if you guys were not aware I
