my Twitter I spend a lot of my life on
Twitter so if you want to follow me

Twitter username I thought doing a Q&amp;amp;A

personal video and I thought this would
give you guys an opportunity to ask me
some questions if you had any questions
regarding last video we're back in my
sweatshirt that we know it's a Q&amp;amp;A I
wear sweatshirt every Q&amp;amp;A you won't

a good song three things I cannot live
with that brah I'm gonna string my
YouTube what's with my family friends in
the same category be kind of I might be
cheating but like third one food yeah my
dog catches my family I'm gonna be
honest about this someone asked me
what's my dream car so I always always
always like to keep it real with you
guys and be honest with you guys because
that's who I am it's like value and a
person and everything just loyalty real
news this is all I need I have not told
my
this or any of my social media really a
little bit of setup like barely because
I did want to see my house bragging or
that I was like so sick and I got my
dream car and whatever because that's
just who I am I'm not going to be like
cocky a lot of you guys have been asking
if I got a new car because I did a day
of my life where I would be MW shopping
and I ended up actually getting a
different car than a BMW I just like
went for it and I got my dream car and
it it makes me so unbelievably happy I
love cars I pretty much feel like I
could live in my car that's how much it
was but I got a Range Rover Sport 2017
Oh black cause what I love oh my god
like 33 started a literally short cry as
much as I love my car and as much as
whatever I would not have be able to
lease it I just lease it without you
guys
I love you I love you you're amazing and
my favorite people ever know that and
know that I would rather hear he has a
better life than that car that's just
that's that's what I wanted to point out
new merch coming soon and there is a
little bit of new March on my website
right now
they change the URL so I should really
addresses address this it's based on a
lie flash smell - joy I don't know how
we lost flash mal joy oh no it happened
some MMA n hoodies and GRA that wasn't
there than the douches crotchety and
gray that was their unprecedented but
you're not probably did to be honest
also allows excess juices and my new
favorite hoodie of my entire merch line
oh my god I'm sense of it it's an
all-white zip up and on the back it says
deuces in red like graphic graphic it's
like the Pablo font pretty much I hope
you guys liked it too it will be linked
down below if you want to check it out
and also i'm helen lob status yet but i
think i am i'm coming out to your
necklace soon so stations that is like a
choker it's something i love on and
you'll just have to wait and see because
i'm obsessed with it and i hope you guys
like it too it's more my style my last
necklace i like it the Lotus one's a
little less my style now and this one is
like something I wear everyday so I'm
really happy about it
what's your workout routine okay this is
a really good question because I was
really really really into working out
and talk about that in my last video I
lost a lot of weight whatever so now
about balance like I eat healthy that I
have cheat days or just like mmm oppa
burrito I'm a-gonna burrito usually I do
like little workouts at home just
because going this June just really
likes makes me lazy and I display on my
phone what I love doing just putting on
headphones blasting music like dancing
around in my room as stupid as the
students but I literally like get a
sweat from that and I like my heart rate
gets really obsolete I kind of come this
for you and then we have a bike in my
house like a stationary bike so we have
we have a stationary bike so I will
occasionally write that last time we
committed like 13 miles I can like spend
forever on that thing because I just sit
on my phone on my bike so it's like
really nice and then I usually do like
abs but legs whatever and mix it up but
I usually do that but for me I've just
realized that everything about
everything is valid so fav Starbucks
order I have not told you guys this and
this is so weird for me to even say but
I should drink coffee every single
morning at least one cup of 12 ounces
and then I realized I was like do I want
to rely on coffee as what should I do
because I was relying on coffee so
heavily much and be like I can't get out
of bed unless I have my coffee like is
that I took coffee autumn I got it well
not took it out but I don't drink in
every morning instead I drink green tea
and pointing to it over there because I
see it it slept in green PS of some
stevia stevia you guys always correct me
on that and it's really good and I tried
drinking that instead because green teas
actually really good for your skin and
my skin was really bad couple months ago
and now it's gotten better because I
just tried to take care of myself but if
I do go to Starbucks and if I do get
coffee
it'll probably be a venti because go
thing or go home I get just an iced
coffee with soy milk and I get like the
little gooders
packages or whatever they're like the
green one and I felt like two or three
of them in for some sweetness but
without having real sugar pushovers bad
for you so that's my stupid surgery
someone asked me I really like this
question who would you say is the most
influential person in your life and it's
definitely a hundred cent my dad he's
literally my best friend I tell him
everything we're like the same person
like we have the same moral just
everything I just relate to him so crazy
much and I feel like you just like
literally my best friend was just so
dope to have a parent as the best friend
because they're always there for you no
matter what and
- crotches I love you I would not be Who
I am today with acting like honestly
100% he's always like you were just born
like that like mad bro you grew me up
like how do you say positive I struggle
with this so much PS I love you I love
you more I did address in my last video
that like I was super underweight and I
gained back weight now and I'm a lot
happier with it
in general and whatever but the way to
stay body positive that's a really hard
question just because there's so many
girls on Instagram that are looking like
amazing bodies perfect bodies whatever
but you also got realize there's a lot
of editing in that there's a lot a lot
of editing that could go on that you
wouldn't even be sure about like I just
want you to know never compare
yourselves to people you see on your
feet or whatever because I don't know
the whole situation is kind of like SS
but I don't even know where else it
without Wow such a ranter no matter what
you look like whatever you need to be
happy with it if you think you're
overweight if you think you're
underweight and you want to change it
make a move to change it just do it in a
healthy way so look in the mirror and be
like I am beautiful the way I am and I
need to know that it's just all like a
mindset like you need to just love your
body give it attention love it and I
love you back I don't even know so many
things but I hope you do so stay on the
topic of like weight and body someone
asked me how did you getting your
healthy weight well I was on like this
diet where pretty much ate the same
thing every day because when I like
something I don't get sick coefficients
like I could eat the same breakfast and
lunch and dinner every day I'd be like
yeah I like it I'm a stick with it hard
for me to branch out that's gonna be
honest but I had like a very strict not
strict but like since I liked it I would
eat it every day or most days I don't
know if it just wasn't enough or I was
also working out too much because I
don't go to the gym literally every day
for like hours and it was just a lot I
guess so I think everything in
moderation something that I do now if
you want to gain a more healthy way to
stop just like I'm going to eat a bunch
of like crap and put it in my body
because that's not good for your body I
really know I just kind of started
eating what I felt like and what my body
told me I wanted and I think that helped
a lot to those like I'm creating a
burrito a half a burrito if I want like
falafel which I would really crave a lot
I feel like I'm having falafel so it's
really just listen to your body just
don't be crazy with like that
be eating but it's not bad to have two
days and to eat what you feel like you
want your are known tips on dealing with
fake friends I love you I love me too I
probably feel like I dress fake friends
and like every cue Navy but is something
that I cannot stand like even thinking
about it just makes me wanna like bro I
just don't understand the whole idea of
fakeness boom members make sense to me
my advice to you is to see if they're
really there for you when you're at your
worst if you're not feeling good they're
going to comfort you and they're gonna
ask if you're okay and they're going to
check up on you everything and just to
stay seem like they care if they
genuinely seem like they care then you
got a good one or they just talk to you
when they need or like want something
from you
that's what you know I've had some
instances of people that don't hit me up
unless they're asking for something
which is like but whatever is cool you
do you but like I just don't want
someone like that in my life you feel me
you can't change someone just not like
no polite to be like I'm gonna change
you to someone who I want you to be and
it's just like that's my advice to you
is to just remove them from your life if
you know that they're if you're aware
that they're a fake friend just what's
the point what's the point of putting
yourself through that that's what I
realized what's your favorite song from
Black Bears new album digital druglord
low minds during me I love you so much I
love you more my favorite song from his
new album is probably Chateau when I
play that in the car
I don't large watch out for them slink
ones motto so someone asked are you
gonna do another car tour video this
goes along with the other car question
but if you guys would like to see that I
would love to do it just because this is
my baby I will leave it if you always do
but I totally understand you guys don't
want to see that because I don't know
it's just not the most modest thing ever
and I try to stay modest and humble I
just don't want to be putting that in
someone's face in my new car so like you
can want to see it totally understand so
