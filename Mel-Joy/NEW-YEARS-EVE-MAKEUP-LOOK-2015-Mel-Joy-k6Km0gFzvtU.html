I can't keep my hands to myself
hey guys it's me Mel so today's video is
going to be a tutorial as you can see
I'm wearing more makeup than I usually
do this is a New Year's Eve makeup
tutorial thing if you guys want any New
Year's parties or just chilling with
friends but want to look a little bit
more festive this is just an idea of
what you guys can wear I did a darker
lip for the winter time and a smoky eye
but involving some purple and pink
colors but also like like silver and
white and all that jazz I did some
winged eyeliner as well but I think that
this is a really new year's the holiday
time for special occasions if you guys
want to see how to get this look stay
tuned and keep watching so the first
thing I'm doing is taking some face
moisturizer and applying this to my face
to create a base for the makeup then I'm
taking my Neutrogena Healthy Skin liquid
makeup and applying this all over my
face as my foundation and I really like
this foundation it's not too heavy it's
not too light it's like the perfect
amount of coverage so I'm just applying
this all over my face
and make sure to blend it down your neck
so then I'm taking a lighter concealer
and I'm just applying this under my eye
see out of those dark circles and I'm
blending it in with my brush and also my
ring finger once I'm done with that I'm
taking a lighter concealer and I'm just
putting that in the corner of my eyes
just to brighten them up then I'm taking
my Sonia Kashuk bronzer and a bronzing
brush and I'm just bronzing my
cheekbones my jawline and my temples so
then I'm taking my healthy skin blend by
Neutrogena and I'm using this as a
highlighter it's more not as shimmery as
a regular highlighter but I didn't want
to make my face look too you know shiny
so then I'm taking my Neutrogena shine
control powder I love this stuff it
keeps you not shiny for so long so I'm
just applying this all over my face and
this helps lock in all the makeup and
keep me not shiny so yeah then I'm just
combing out my brows with a spoolie
that's all I do to my brows I just comb
about that I'm taking a nude champagne
cream eyeshadow and applying this for a
base for the eye shot I'm going to apply
I like using this just because it makes
the eyeshadow some more pigmented and
more shimmery then I'm taking the
Neutrogena nourishing long wear eye
shadow and cool plum and I'm just taking
they light pink shade and this is really
cool because it has built-in primer so
it makes the eyeshadow stay all day and
it doesn't crease or anything like that
it lasts up to 12 hours of color and is
only $9.99 so it saves you some money so
I'm just applying the shimmery pink
shade all over my lid and then just
blending it out then I'm just taking the
dark plum color and I'm focusing this on
the outer half of my eyelid just to make
the look more dramatic but we're going
to be layering other colors over it this
is just kind of a base then I am taking
the eyeshadow palette smoky steel and
I'm taking the first silvery color and I
am putting that just on the middle of my
the lid and then I'm taking the cool
plum color
and blending that in the crease I'm
sorry it's blurry but you get the idea
and then I'm just blending it to make
sure it looks all blended and no harsh
lines and then I'm taking the dark
silver and smoky steel and I'm applying
this also in the crease and this has a
little tint of blue in it which I think
looks really cool with the purple and
then I'm taking that brown color and the
dark silver color again and putting this
on my lower lash line just to create a
smokier look and I'm also just putting
this a little bit in the corners and my
upper lash line also and I just wanted
to say thank you to my friends at
Neutrogena for sending in these items
and sponsoring this video you can pick
up any of these items at Walmart they're
really affordable and really nice to
create your holiday look and I'll have
everything linked down below then I'm
taking the light pink color again and
just putting this on the first half of
my eyelid just in case any dark colors
went over it then I'm taking the white
color and putting this in the inner
corner of my eye just to make me look
more awake I really like this step so
then I'm just blending all the
eyeshadows out one last time to make
sure it looks how I want then I am
taking this brow highlighter and I'm
just highlighting my brows and blending
it in
then I'm taking the their real eyeliner
and I just did some a winged eyeliner as
you can see yeah I didn't do this on
camera cuz it takes me a while but if
you guys want another video just let me
know so then I just curled my eyelashes
and I'm using the Hypnose drama mascara
by Lancome and applying this on my upper
and lower lashes then I'm taking the
their real mascara by benefit and
putting this on top of the first mascara
and I really like mascara so I use a lot
of it just because I like my eyelashes
to look long so I'm also applying this
on the top and bottom of my lashes then
I'm taking one last mascara and I'm also
putting this on the top and bottom of my
eyelashes
and sorry I got cut out you can see and
then one last time I'm taking the very
old mascara and putting one last coat of
this I just really like to have long
thick eyelashes so that's why I use so
much mascara
so then I'm done with the mascara and I
got some black eyeliner and I'm just
putting this on my tight line and I'm
also putting it on my lower lash line
so that is a completed Ilyich the next
thing I'm using is the Neutrogena
moisture stick and 70 plum perfect and
I'm obsessed with these they are so nice
so there's mango and shea butter in this
product so it makes your lips so much
softer and smoother in just three days
and it continuously conditions them and
it's only $8.99 which is a lot cheaper
than other products similar to this and
the color is so pigmented too
so yeah I just applied that so I hope
