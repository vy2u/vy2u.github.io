trade lonely the King y'all come from
the Empire sweetness
what is up my beautiful best friends how
are you guys I hope you're doing great
so today's video I'm so excited about
because I recently just got back from
New York literally a day or two ago I
was invited to my first ever Fashion
Week and it was surreal it was super
cool since it was my first one it wasn't
like crazy you know super intense
whatever but I just got to see kind of
like how Fashion Week works and all that
stuff and I thought it was super super
cool so shout out to atetv and Marie
Claire for showing me around and making
sure I was safe there and everything but
pretty much today's video is going to be
what I wore in New York slash like a
lookbook sometimes I limit myself just
because of feedback and all that stuff
and especially where I live it's not
like the biggest thing to try your
hardest every day if that makes sense
you know I don't know I felt really like
free there and really happy just cuz I
was wearing what I want and I felt like
myself so decided to take that mindset
and use it in my daily life where I live
it shouldn't matter the place it should
matter your mindset that was a little
rant anyways I Love New York you have to
go if you haven't been there it's
amazing if you don't like my taste or my
fashion sense or whatever you don't need
to comment on it I don't think at least
I think everyone is entitled to have
their own style and why not share it
with the world and everyone just be who
you want why would you want I don't get
the hate towards people wearing outfits
they like I just thought I don't
understand it so yeah if you want to see
what I wore in New York what I was
liking what I was feeling good in then
stay tuned and keep watching ready
you
so thank you guys so much for watching
that video I hope you enjoyed and if you
did make sure to give it a big thumbs up
so I know you liked it and you would
want to see more from me and also like
always comment video suggestions down
below so I can do what you want to see
so I love you guys to infinity and
beyond I mean it when I say it and I
hope you know that and I hope that you
are having a marvelous morning noon or
night and I will hopefully see your
beautiful face in my next video
okay

today's video is going to be like my
music playlist type but thank this video
