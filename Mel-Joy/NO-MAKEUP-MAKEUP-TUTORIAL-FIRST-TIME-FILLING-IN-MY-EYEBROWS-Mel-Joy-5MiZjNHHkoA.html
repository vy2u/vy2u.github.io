you're a real one huh am i doing I like
me although it's not a good time
hey guys it's me Mel and today's video
is going to be a super super duper super
natural look so I tweeted to you guys
what type of tutorial you guys are going
to see and if you don't follow me on
Twitter you should cuz that's where I
ask a lot about your guys's opinions
yeah I'm Mel joy it's the one handle of
all my Asian aims that I enjoy so yeah
before we get started couple disclaimers
first disclaimer this happened like our
IP I was trying to cook cauliflower
buffalo wings I was taking that pan out
of the oven and this happened so yeah I
burned myself and I'm really annoyed
because this is gonna leave a brutal
scar if you have any scar remedies leave
them down below I would absolutely love
that second of all I'm sick so if I
sound gross and nasally that is why I'm
sorry I we're just gonna roll with it so
this look was just requested by you guys
you guys asked for really simple really
natural really dewy glowy look so that's
what we're doing today and also another
thing my nails really gross I'm just
citing whether or not to go back to
acrylics or not I'm just letting my
nails breathe so this is the like
chillin period I'm sorry you have to
look at them but yeah without further
ado I think we should get started if you
want to see how to get this really
natural simple glowy luck then stay
tuned and keep watching I'm gonna start
by putting my headband on because I have
so many flyaways I'm taking once again
like I always use my baby skin
maybelline primer I'm trying to use this
bad boy up and I'm gonna put that all
over the face I wanna prime all my
makeup and since this is a minimal
make-up type of look we're gonna take a
BB cream I don't remember the last time
I like used to BB cream just cuz my
skin's been like a with me recently but
I'm taking the Maybelline Dream pure BB
in waterproof no it's not it's the acne
treatment one I'm taking my damp Beauty
Blender we're gonna put that on the skin
I don't think I've ever used a tinted
moisturizer with my Beauty Blender so
hopefully I like it and if not all mmm
thank you something
just patting this on my face oh man that
was not enough so we're gonna go with
some war even though this is you know my
no makeup makeup look my baby here's
still managed to get in the way this
makes me blend down the neck and I hope
this is my color because I haven't used
this in a minute
me so I'm sort so once we're done you
know I can't talk today
so once we're done with that our skin
tone is our skin tone is evenly
distributed I don't I don't even now I'm
taking my Born This Way concealer a lot
of you guys suggested the shape tape
concealer to me so I'm going to get that
because you guys suggested it to me but
I'm gonna put this how I usually do it
down my nose and in a V triangle not a V
in a triangle okay Mel I'm a little
dysfunctional it's been to the day I was
writing essays old days you know what
I'm saying hopes we're gonna do that on
my forehead because I do have some acne
right here you know I want to cover up
and also fry lighting and then I'm also
going to put some on my chin and then
any other pimples that the tinted
moisturizer did not really cover didn't
really do it for me and then I'll show
around my nose because I'm sick and my
nose is red so it's not a good time
I'm taking my Beauty Blender and I'm
taking the other side and I'm just
blending that out I feel like I should
be talking when I blend but like what do
I say I'm just blending I'm also oh my
goodness I forgot to do my eyebrows for
this video I'm so sorry I'm also just
gonna be putting that on my lid as a
primer we're not going to be doing like
a too much eyeshadow today so I'm not
gonna worry about that too much
I swear whatever I film it's like
stranger things it's in my house like
I'm also gonna blend it down just make
sure it's all good
I'll even and once we're done with that
I'm not gonna do two layers of concealer
even though I usually do that because
this is like just a fresher lighter look
I'm gonna be going in with my RC ma no
color powder and my Beauty Blender oh
gosh we're gonna be putting that no no
we're gonna be baking it under my eyes
and whoever I put the concealer you guys
know the drill
don't forget the chin cuz did you notice
when I take a lot of my selfie stick
like this you just got to make sure that
your makeup will be on for those selfies
I love baking I just find it fun so I
just put it wherever Oh No
okay cute so then as we're waiting for
this to
bake I'm gonna zoom you in hey I'm gonna
go in with my morphe 35o palette oh wait
where I'm gonna put some of the powder
on my eyelids real quick I'm gonna be
going in with the lightest shade right
here we're just gonna even out my whole
eyelid of any veins of any redness
Tiffany you catch my drift and I'm using
my morphe flat shader brush like I got
it in a kit so I don't know the exact
like name you know I'll link it down
below then with my morphe blending brush
and this warm brown color right here I'm
going to be Devin that on tapping it off
and swirling that into the crease
real lightly just for a little
definition me personally I like to have
some residual eyeshadow on my lids I'm
just gonna be putting that with a really
light hand swirling it into the crease
and the outer V half of my tutorials are
literally just like me playing with
makeup on camera so once I'm done with
that I'm taking this morphe like angled
brush and I'm just blending it a little
bit to make sure there's no harsh lines
or anything like that this is just gonna
add a nice little definition a nice it's
just gonna add a no I can't talk today
this is gonna add a nice little
definition a little color to the lids
you know we don't want it to be too
boring so natural that's what we're doin
tonight
also I'm gonna be doing my brows this is
about to get intense because I'm gonna
fill in my eyebrows if you guys are new
to my channel hey but if if you're not
new to my channel then you know that I
don't fill in my eyebrows so this is
about to be really weird for me I just
leave him like this and I'm just like
okay we're good I don't even know if I
want to fill him in now but like why not
maybe hmm
we're just we're gonna do I'm taking my
Smashbox taupe brow tech shaping powder
I don't know I don't even like have like
brow products so I'm just gonna I don't
I don't even I don't know what to do for
a little right there oh okay open the
write this in the sparse areas of my
eyebrows my eyebrows are gonna be really
dark in it but I'll put a little in the
front cuz like you know you know why not
I'm not going to go too overboard with
this because I don't feel my eyebrows
this is weird so weird I don't like it
alright no mmm I don't think I'm a fan
I'm just gonna brush it out to make it
look more natural like a hardcore
brushes well you guys wanted to see me
filling my brows so that's what we're
left with and I'm not a fan
so hopefully to tame deem that I did it
doesn't look as bad in person I'm gonna
take this gel and put it through them I
just used some what is this great lash
clear gel it was like super gloopy so
I'm just brushing it out again how bad
do my eyebrows look alright so I just
looked back at the footage to make sure
they didn't look too bad and I might be
just overreacting this is just really
weird to me just gonna move on this was
a learning experience comment down below
what you think I should move on my
eyebrows want to define them I'm taking
the brow gal little duo thing taking the
matte side and I'm just gonna
I like the brows and we're just gonna
use my finger because I almost went back
in with the powder no move on no mmm am
i doing so now what I'm gonna do is
sweep away that powder with this big
morphe brush we're just gonna sweep it
all away and I'm gonna go back in with
some of the powder and apply that to the
rest of my face I'm gonna put too much
on though because I want cakey cuz this
is a natural look I just realized I
think I completely forgot to put tinted
moisturizer on my nose and my nose gets
so red so alright and especially cuz I'm
sick like ma'am alright I ain't re-enter
into right all right all right all right
I'm you know I'm doing then I'm gonna go
back in with the color that I would do
anything I'm gonna go back in with the
color I used in my crease nope don't
want that use that brush I'll use this
brush I can't speak English today with
my Coastal Scents no.2 brush I'm just
gonna put that on the lower lash line a
little bit just a little not too
intensely or anything like that I don't
even know if it was that noticeable so I
get off wait a little more this is
completely optional you don't have to do
this i yo load it with my eyebrow
today why not do this too once we're
done with that we are going to curl my
lashes like so to my Sally Hansen's
eyelash curler if you were wondering and
why did my I just get so red maybe this
is what makes my eye so red something's
been making my eyes so red after I do my
makeup maybe this is it maybe I need
know I asked earlier I'm going in with
my better than sex waterproof mascara
you guys will barely ever see me use any
other mascara but if you have any good
ones come with them down below because
I'm always open to trying the mascara
like chakra is actually choking me right
now oh my god I was gonna play this to
the bottom lashes like so and then and
then and then and then I'm gonna take my
clump crusher by um hey covergirl and
doing another coat this is like pretty
much dry that so I'm just kind of using
this to Garrett of any of the clumps and
also to lengthen I'm also putting that
on the bottom lashes and I'm just gonna
gonna move on we're gonna do some blush
that's right ladies
barely like ever use blush so this is
like a rare occurrence I'm taking we're
good we're good
I'm taking my tart exposing a little of
that on the apples of my cheeks I really
don't use blush like ever just because I
get really red really easily but we're
gonna I'm gonna do it for the sake of
the tutorial because you guys are always
like you don't use blush I'm like
they're people mal like other people use
blush like just cuz you don't use
blushes make other people don't want to
see you using blush I always use my kula
bronzer but today we're gonna use the
Sigma or a bronzer just cuz I'm trying
to like change things up a bit and I'm
gonna go in with this morphe brush we're
gonna contour with it
Oh y'all don't worry we're gonna blend
don't you worry ha this is really cute I
don't really yeah I'm gonna like this
and kind of do it where I want the
contour to end we're also gonna put some
of the contour on the sides of my nose
just a little bit and I think that made
my nose look more red what are you gonna
do and then we're gonna take the big
blending brush and we're just gonna
blend that all out the next thing I'm
gonna do is take my Becca opal um
shimmering skin perfecter pureed donut
but it's pretty much a cream and it's a
mini one how cute and I'm going to be
putting up where the highlight is like
as a base for the highlight
just using a cream to like oh my contour
looks so wack right now and this is just
gonna make us like dewy and glowy hang
that on the nose as well my key pitch oh
all right and then I'm taking my Becca
champagne pop powder cuz we're doing
extra highlighter today we're just we're
doing it I'm gonna take this little
paper blood no I'm gonna take this big
fan morphe brush how fun is this like
that where I put the other highlighter

put it on the sides of my face a little
bit
I love highlight on my nose as well keep
it smooth look at that I just moisturize
my lips a little bit with Carmex and now
I'm gonna go in with my L'Oreal palette

highlighter ooh I'm gonna take this
really pretty light pink right there and
I'm just gonna put that all over my lips
