I'm just so forever grateful for this

know where the button is so I'm pretty
much just gonna be talking about some
favorites I've been having what I was
into we got some music fashion food food
make up life anyways so I guess I'll
start with flashing the first thing I've
been loving loving bar mom jeans and
like boyfriend jeans and just loose
comfortable nice geez I just got these
in my Black Friday haul so like this
certain pair wasn't like my favorite of
November but it is one of my top
favorite jeans um they look like this
riffs in the jeans rips in the jeans
rips in the knees and they're from
Topshop they're so comfortable I think
they look so cute like oh I'm obsessed
that has definitely been
fashion favorite like yes yes so then
the next year one of the shoes fell
r.i.p they are the classic van like
checkerboard
style shoes and I've been loving these
so much first of all they're so easy to
get on and off your foot they're just I
don't know really cute I think they add
a lot to an outfit of his little detail
and still like retro and cute they look
really cute boyfriend jeans I'm a fan
we're not mom jeans and one of our
fashion favorites like jewelry but it's
these hoops
oh it's honestly Justin like hoops in
general these are gold ones but I also
have some silver ones I just buy like
you know not super expensive hoops just
like the cheap ones or whatever but like
I think they add so much to an outfit
and I just I've been obsessed with hoops
if you can tell in some of my instagrams
and snapchats
and stuff other one hoops a lot more I
don't know I'm gonna do it make you feel
like fierce you know make you feel fear
so hoops have been my favorite accessory
and chokers if you couldn't tell I wear
chokers a lot I'm not wearing one right
now though so next moving on to beauty
I'll may have a couple just because when
it comes to beauty I'm not someone to
like branch out and it's really bad
because a lot of the times I actually
branch out I end up loving the products
can you hear the trash the trash truck
garbage truck there we go when I have a
routine that I like I will like stick to
those products that's really bad because
I could be using products and I like you
before I'm just too afraid to branch out
so I have some products that you have
probably seen in my old videos it's just
three mascaras this is like my mascara
triplet Keys like mascara duo triplet
these three mascaras work so well
together the timeline right now and like
everyday this is the Too Faced better
than sex normal I have the waterproof
too I love them both the essence I heart
extreme volume mascara waterproof this
is literally two dollars and so good
this one is the clump crusher buy cover
I'll have this for so long and I've
always loved it and these together just
like first you got the length and just
amazing this I love this mascara and
then you got the volume and then you got
like the separation so like if there's
any clumps this will separate them I
don't know it's perfect I love it and
it's just been working for me really
great so then this next favorite is from
Milani they don't test on animals which
is amazing
and I broke this so like it's going
everywhere but it's the prep set and go
transparent face powder I cracked it but
now it's got like a loose powder but I
have been using this just as like a
translucent powder to set my makeup kind
of in replace for some like loose
powders I've used does a job it's good
it lasts a while moving on to food
favorites cuz girl you know I love food
I'll just do these these are like me
perfect little snack I am vegan if you
didn't know so all this food is vegan
there are these Ritz toasted chips
original 55 percent less fat on a half
oh right now
Sjogren's so that's just been a little
perfect snack with some fruit for
anything and then the next thing has
been a huge favorite this one it's crazy
are these Boca veggie protein spicy
chicken veggie patties it says vegan
right on the box but I did read the
instructions instructions ingredient
Lord they have 12 grams of protein they
have 60% less fat than breaded chicken
patties so you know it's a good time and
they see so good and so crazy realistic
I've also tried the original ones not
the spicy ones those are good too this
just has a little bit more flavor but
it's like different type of flavor you
know I'm saying so I just chop this up
and put it on my salads and it just adds
so much taste and so much yumminess so
then the last food favorite is kind of a
weird and random what but it it's an
apple or apples in general yeah there we
go no this is just my favorite apple but
I have been loving apples recently I
used to like eat apples to be like okay
but I love them now probably have what
at least one apple a day no an apple day
keeps the doctor away it's not a sick
last week
I've just been obsessed with like
cutting up apples and then with like
some oranges and some grapes or pears or
strawberries oh my god okay I got a joke
I don't know so weird favorite but it's
been a favorite so then randomly I'll do
a perfume the black opium YSL perfume
and this stuff smells so good whenever I
wear it whenever someone gives me like
you smell so good or like
you smell amazing like this is the
perfume I get complimented on the most I
got this for Christmas I think it's from
Christmas I got this on my birthday and
oh my god it just smells so good okay
anyways moving on lastly I'm gonna do
some music favorites because music is my
ish people who don't listen music I'm
