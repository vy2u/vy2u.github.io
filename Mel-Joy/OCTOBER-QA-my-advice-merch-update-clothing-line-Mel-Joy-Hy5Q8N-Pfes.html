today's video is going to be a Q&amp;amp;A I
like to post a Q&amp;amp;A at least once a month
but I have been slacking recently and
there's been a lot going on but we back
we do in a Q&amp;amp;A and I'm excited to talk
to you guys answer you guys questions
and all that good stuff I just tweeted
out like usual ask me questions using
the hashtag ask Mel joy I took
screenshots of some of my favorites
because there's so many I feel like I
haven't done any Q&amp;amp;A where I just sit
down I talked to you guys I just thought
this would be perfect to update you guys
love's new dish so someone asked first
time getting noticed by a supporter in
public by the way I love you I love you
too and this is such a fun story for me
to tell because like I still remember
how I felt in that exact moment it was
so surreal it was so dope the first time
that I remember getting like spotted or
someone asking for a photo so I was at
my homecoming football game against our
rivalry rivalry school and a boyfriend
around that time so I was with him at
the game with some other people probably
we were waiting in line to get food I
think yeah like they have little food
like stationed at every game I get
tapped on the shoulder or something like
what was the girl got my attention
somehow I don't remember exactly what
you said but she asked for photo with me
and I was like shook I was like frickin
mash is this my moment will you put me
in this one he he love you shut up
Marlene this one's for you I love you so
someone asked me how not to care what
others think of you and recently this
has been a big thing on my mind for me
as a person trying to figure out and I'm
just trying to live my best life that's
all I'm trying to do I really noticed
that I used to care way too much what
people thought of me like way way too
much and I'm at the point now where I
just it's like I don't want to care but
I just also can't afford to care it's
not worth my time it's not worth my
energy the real ones in your life that
support you for who you are are the ones
that matter my whole thing is not to
care what people think of me but I don't
want to hurt anyone I don't want to do
whatever I think people can be nice
without caring what people think do and
I mean you can't care life is too short
to give up and it's true it's what I've
learned so live your life the way you
want to be and if people don't agree
with that then can you start a clothing
line please girl I have some news for
you my Alton
life or right now I'm Michaels changeup
by the week but my dream has been to
have my own clothing line
I want to steer away from having my
merch like revolved around me I wanted
to make it my style I don't know if I
can talk about it because I don't know
all the details about it but I've been
working on it so hard with my merch guys
and we're getting it done but I'm coming
out with some pieces that are all just
clothes
I would wear so it's gonna be kind of
like a small clothing line I know it's
happening but I don't know the specifics
but I will find out and I will let you
guys know what is the most important
lesson you learned this year whoa that
is a great question I have learned so
much this year to a point that my brains
a little like filled with information at
this point what I would say my biggest
thing is to put yourself first and to do
what feels right to you do what you love
just you like you need to focus on
yourself and that's what I've noticed I
used to always put off my own needs and
whatever and I would just hang out with
people and forget about myself it's like
ah I need to take care of myself like
I'm living my life I'm having fun it
doesn't matter but I lost myself because
I wasn't caring about myself and I
wasn't loving myself I look back on that
and it's sad to me but it's also like
I'm in such a better place now when it
comes to myself
spend every day do living the life you
want and live it for you and you know
and the people who support you over
every we'll join you for the ride and
it'll be dope but for the people who
don't support you in that way forget
about him they just they can't take up
that time and that energy of yours I
think I've learned how to care for
myself like I care for my friends in my
family or whatever and it feels dope
that has just affected me as a person
the most and I'm very grateful that I
have realized that realization and I've
learned from it and everything but the
next question is what song is on repeat
for you and girl girl don't get me
started about this I recently found the
song literally a couple days ago for my
friend
I literally have been blasting this
every single second since I found it
because it is so freaking good I know
this is a popular song it's been on the
radio a lot but it was my first time
hearing it when my friend showed it to
me and now it's one of my favorites so
i'ma play it for you guys
it's called faking it by Calvin Harris
Kalani and lil yachty
I'm just sharing back to that song for a
minute
a lot of breath oh that song is just so
good faking it
Calvin Harris kailani a little yeah II
like whoa that is the song that would
get me in a good mood I swear to God how
is living on your own band what are some
challenges you've faced okay that's a
good amount of times I've been facing
first of all living on my own is awesome
I mean it's super independent which you
know I love to be independent that's the
reason I moved out but there's a lot
that needs to be done you know it's part
of growing up in whatever but it's been
quite the experience just finding out
everything that I have to do that I
didn't do but my parents did and I
wasn't aware of it so shout out to my
parents you guys are awesome you do a
lot I mean it gets lonely easily I guess
because I'm alone like every day by
myself unless I go somewhere or I do
something sometimes I'll just like stay
in for a couple days and be editing and
like grinding and whatever but I won't
see people and I won't even like talk to
other humans sometimes that just messes
with my head because you start feeling a
lot more alone than you actually are I'm
all learning how to deal with it slowly
you know I moved in recently but I think
I've made a lot of progress if you could
go anywhere in the world right now where
would you go and why the first place
that popped into my head was definitely
in New York I miss New York so much I
wasn't even there for that long it was
my first time in there but I fell in
love the vibes the people the style of
the fashion everything I just I love it
I just love it there okay I need to talk
about this question real quick because
it's what advice would you give if
someone was talking about you behind
your back
I've actually done with this a lot in my
life and it's just really annoying when
someone talks about you behind your back
especially when it's like super negative
and then to your face they're super
positive that's when it's just to know
go with me I have dealt with this a good
amount um just because a lot of people
have a lot to say about what I do in my
life when I was younger I guess when
that happened to me I would kind of shut
down I'll get like sad and like hurt by
it and whatever and I wouldn't know what
to do and now it's completely different
to me when people are talking about you
behind your back it's usually because
they're jealous or because they don't
have better things
about like I just think talking you so
funny but there's always an underlying
reason I feel like for things going on
like that so think about that don't try
to take it personally because it's them
it's them not talking about you like
that but my way of dealing with it now I
guess I'd like grew up more i had a
lower tolerance of dealing with that
does that make sense I just didn't want
that to happen especially for me if it's
like irrelevant stuff and I just would
ever be the bigger person and move past
it and just know that they they do that
and be cautious about it for me if it's
stuff that is not true they're spreading
stuff about you that's not true
rumors whatever that's right draw the
line I'm really truthful sometimes I'm
not like openly truthful but if you ask
me questions like I'm not gonna lie to
your face I'm just not so when it comes
to this I like being truthful and I like
confronting the person and asking them
what's up like hey why are you saying
this stuff about me I don't agree with
it and that's kind of like lame that
you're doing that bro like what's going
on stand up for yourself that's what I
think I've just I've started standing up
for myself so much more and just telling
people what's up high school is crazy
growing up is crazy and some people just
I just want to mess with you I don't
know what it is but I don't like that
and I shut it down and I'm not like
super close to them and I don't really
know them I'll just probably steer way
because I haven't had a relationship
with them yet and if they're saying all
this stuff why would I
but if I'm already friends with someone
and you know like on good terms and I
like them and they say stuff like that
that's where I draw the line like why do
you want people in your life that you
have to trip about and worry about all
the time and what they're saying it's
not worth it to me
so either confront them and work it out
or maybe move on I don't know that was
quite a rap but I hope that helped in
some way I mean some people see that
like oh my god they confronted me but
it's like you were the one like out of
pocket first I'm just letting you know
that the stuff you're saying is just
stuff but you shouldn't be saying it
people just need to have morals these
days someone asks hey when are you and
Liv gonna Club you guys PS I love you
and I love you too I don't know I miss
Liv it's the funnest filming with a
youtuber that like you're close with and
mean Liv we have so much fun when we
film then I'm gonna fly out and see you
or I'm gonna fly you out to see me
because I miss you so freaking much
someone says advice for balancing school
and friends PS I love you and I hope to
see you again oh my god if you put two
photos of us I love when you guys send
me phone
of us together just literally makes my
heart super freakin happy I love you and
I miss you and to answer your question I
personally think that balancing school
and friends I mean for me I have to
balance school and friends and YouTube
and all that stuff and it can be so hard
there's points so I'm just like I can't
do it I can't do it all this is too much
my brain is gonna freakin explode I
never wanted a piece of advice is to
make sure you are on track you know make
sure you're getting your schoolwork done
whatever and then go hang out friends
make sure you put your attention on
yourself and you make sure you're doing
your best and the people who love and
support you will help you with that and
make you succeed even better balance is
so important and it's so hard to find
but for me I always like making
schedules and to-do lists I'll map out
what time I'm gonna do my homework what
time I'm gonna film which I'm gonna do
this and then at my free time I'll hit
my friends up see if they're free to
hang out if they're not I'll just do
other stuff you know sadly I think
school is a lot of busy work and could
be done in a much better way don't even
get me started on the school system but
there's a lot of work that has to come
with it but it's not gonna be your whole
life you know you just got to grind
through these times I think that's all
the questions I'm gonna answer today
