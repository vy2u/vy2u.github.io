guys it's me Mel and as you can tell I'm
wearing a sweatshirt
so that means today is going to be a Q&amp;amp;A
and yes even though we're in August and
I'm kind of already sweating it's a
tradition that I wear a sweatshirt in
every Q&amp;amp;A so I'm just going to go with
it if I start turning pink or looking
rough it's because it's hot Italian doll
so if you're going to even leave a
comment about how I don't skate because
I post an Instagram photo in this and I
bought a thrush or shirt in my last fall
people like you don't skate you can't
worth my shirt I'm sorry you don't even
need to like that comment just because
I've heard it enough so I asked you guys
on my Twitter if you don't follow my
Twitter it's right here Atmel joy this
is the one handle that I like out of all
my social medias because it's so simple
Mel Joe it's not mal underscore Joe with
three wives I myself AM L 2 L so I asked
you guys with the hashtag ask Mel joy to
ask me questions and I'm going to be
answering them because I love cuny's
even though Q&amp;amp;A seem to be dying down I
think it lets you talk to your
subscribers keep you guys updated with
my life I think cuties are very
important and I will always do them so
the first question is what other ideas
you have in mind for March so if you
guys didn't know I came out with a
jewelry line I'm so pumped I'll put the
link down below for you guys I've talked
about it already I did a whole video on
it and everything I'm selling the
necklace that I always wear and I'm
coming out with more jewelry and wow
it's getting really hot but if you guys
want to check out my jewelry line just
click the link down below for other
ideas of merch I really want to do so my
clothing merch like maybe sweatpants
sweatshirts shirts a lot of you guys
asked for iPhone cases I'm upset with
fuzzy socks so I kind of want to do
fuzzy socks I'm working on making some
merch that's a little sneak peek so just
stay tuned and yeah what Netflix show
have you been binge watching okay I have
been binge watching One Tree Hill most
of you guys know this on my snapchat I
posted a picture literally of me crying
because when Tree Hill got me in my
fields I was talking to guys on Jeana
and I was like oh yeah I think I'm at
season 3 and then I looked at my Netflix
later when I was watching it and I look
season 5 obviously I've been binge
watching it because I've watched a lot
more than I thought that shows honestly
amazing
my best friend got me into it so
hardcore and I I'm like so involved if
you guys watch One Tree Hill like this
video or comment down below like your
favorite character or what season you're
on because I'm honestly obsessed did you
decide to do online school and this is
something that I have not announced on
any of my social medias except for you
now my you now people get like a little
like sneak preview of everything yes I
am doing online school next year it's a
decision that I decided to make and and
yes my parents weren't totally on board
with it at first but we did more
research we talked about it we spent
like a lot of time working on this and
then we finally decided that it is going
to be the best for me and yes for my
junior year I am going to online school
I honestly was having such a hard time
balancing my social life my sports life
and my school life when I was in high
school if normal public school I would
spend the week doing my schoolwork after
school I would have two hours of sports
every day and then on the weekends I
were film and edit I ended up not having
time hanging out friends anymore and at
one point I hadn't hung out friends like
a couple months just because I was so
busy with like doing YouTube other
weekend I didn't have time to see them
and then doing sports and then focusing
on school and everything so I was just
very stressed out and not as happy as I
would have liked to be and now I think
I'll have a lot more time to focus on my
to make it better and make it better
quality I know I was rushing a lot when
I was doing in school and I'll have more
time to see my friends because being
social something that's really important
to me and also for traveling or I won't
have to worry about missing a week or
missing however long and I'm also
someone who gets distracted really
easily in class if someone will be
talking to me I will not get what the
teachers saying so I'm just happy that I
can focus on my own education I'm a very
independent learner I'll just sit down
and do it I used to be a very like group
based learner but in high school it kind
of changed I know there's some
controversy on it but I don't even think
there should be just because it's
people's lives they should do what
education they think is best for them
and if you're wondering what program I'm
doing I'm doing k12
what's one of the most important things
you've learned in the last year PS I
love you so much I love you more I've
learned a lot this year I think this is
probably the year of me
severing things and realizing a lot of
stuff which I'm thankful for I went
through lot of things that you might not
want to go through but you end up
realizing a lot after it you know
everyone has those things so really
really learn to surround yourself with
people that you love and that you know
care about you because there are a lot
of fake people in the world but there
are also a lot of people that care about
you a lot and you should be spending
time with those people I've also learned
to be you completely you be confident in
yourself love yourself because you need
to love yourself in order to love others
I did a whole video on the
self-confidence Q&amp;amp;A about things like
that I've learned so much I could
obviously make such a long video
honestly like at the end of this year I
feel like a completely different person
and I'm happy about it it's in a good
way a lot of the things I learned was
from YouTube and you guys helped me out
so much in my life so I'm so grateful
for you guys and I wouldn't be the
person I am today without you guys
honestly and without YouTube so very
grateful for that
yeah I've honestly learned to just live
your life for you you need to do what
you love because it's your life can't
live it for anyone else you have to live
it for you yeah can you put this
question in your video by the way I love
you I love you too mmm it's gonna be
right with you
does it ever hit you that your
subscribers are real people and not just
numbers on the screen yes it hits me
every day I'm such an emotional person
I'll think about now eggs oh my god
almost cry just because it's so unreal
it is honestly so unreal that you look
on a screen you're like okay I have
whatever how many subscribers and then
that doesn't register because it's just
like a number on a screen you know it's
like looking at the time it's like okay
it's whatever time what does that even
mean wow I'm like really tripping myself
up right now and I meet you guys in
person
I do not explain it hits you and like
wow like wow like this is real and it's
an amazing feeling just thinking about
how I have you guys in my life so yes it
hits me all the time definitely it
supplies me with a lot of happiness I
really want to go vegan or vegetarian
and want to know how did you start or
did you just like kind of thing on it
once love you man I love you too before
I went vegan
I was already eating not a lot of food
with like dairy so that wasn't hard for
me to cut out dairy at all there's so
many substitutes for dairy I also wasn't
eating a lot of red meat or anything
like that I was pretty much a just
eating chicken so that wasn't hard to
out either I'll just eat tofu or
tofurkey or veggie burgers so good I
love it so I didn't really cut
everything on at once but the kind of
diet that I was already eating didn't
consist of a lot of dairy and animal
products so no it wasn't wasn't that
hard but I don't know if it's hard just
going like cutting everything out at
once I feel like that might be kind of
hard but transitioning into it I would
suggest transition the protein into like
quinoa I'm glad tools and things like
that but yeah if you want to go
vegetarian vegan that's awesome I would
love to help you through it I'm going to
do more videos about veganism and things
like that because you guys haven't asked
me to do so so like this video and
comment down below if you'd want me to
do that are you going to beautycon NYC
because I need to you ASAP well I need
to meet you too yes I think I'm going
don't hold me to this but since I'll be
on online school I can travel more I
like I'm gonna manage to go I want I
want to manage to go I want every
opportunity to meet you guys and hang
out with you guys and beautycon LA was a
lot of fun so and I've never been in New
York I would love to go to New York but
comment down below if you're going
because I would love to know because the
more of you guys going the better so so
someone asks will you ever follow me and
yes I'll tell you right now I love
talking to you guys on Twitter and stuff
I think I'm going to do a follow spree
pretty soon so stay tuned for that so
I'm asked me what I get a tattoo if so
would it be and why I love you I love
you too and if I were to get a tattoo I
would probably get my grandpa's birthday
like in Roman numerals just somewhere
small because my grandpa was a very very
important person in my life I left him
so so much he really taught me a lot in
life he was definitely one of my
favorite people on this earth I honestly
think that part of the reason I am Who I
am today is because of him so I would
probably at that or something just like
in cursive on my rib my dad has so many
like cute little inspirational things
he's such an inspirational person so I
probably do something that he always
says to me is like something that he has
always said to me since
little kid he always talks about love
light like he would always say when I
was a kid that your love light is so
bright like I don't know a few guys in
front of that but it's like how much
love like you radiates and whatever and
sharing he was he would always talk
about my love light so I would love to
get maybe like a cursive love like I
don't know we'll see but I can get
tattoos and years so what so what's on
my nails I need to get them done I got
my acrylics off and my nails were like
ruined so I'm just letting them chill
and breathe a little bit before I get
nail polish or whatever on them but they
look gross they're rough so yeah that
was my QA I hope you guys enjoyed it
I've tried to do a Q&amp;amp;A at least once a
month just so I can update you guys with
my life and just kind of sit down and
talk to you guys because I feel like
there's a really chill videos and
they're very important for me to be able
to interact with you guys so yeah I love
you guys to infinity and beyond I mean
it when I say it and I hope you're
having a marvelous morning afternoon or
night and I will see you in my next
video deuces</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
