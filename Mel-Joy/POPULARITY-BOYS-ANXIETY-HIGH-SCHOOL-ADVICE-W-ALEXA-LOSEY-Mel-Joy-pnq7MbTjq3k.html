description box we did a video on her

involved and maybe even like a little
Dibble I think you should definitely go
into that because we're giving away some
pretty sick prizes
I think I'm kind of jealous honestly
maybe all I'm to it maybe maybe a win so
today we're going to be doing a high
school like advice Q&amp;amp;A type of thing
because school's just right around
honestly it's already been like a month
and a half that was summer what we
tweeted out for you guys ask us
questions and then we're gonna answer
them yeah regarding school high school
more or less and you're going through
that right now yeah my entire year
survived and she's done it all she's
been through
gonna Pro here with us today and I'm
like the girl that graduated early yeah
I mean is that cool though
so we're just going to be answering some
questions how do you balance your social
life and school life oh we don't know
nobody the biggest thing that I started
doing was making schedules yes and I
kept like a notebook I would just like
literally organize like hours just like
this out of this out of this because I
did my work to two hours a day of sports
what would you buy a new basketball and
track
oh yeah try not a social life and have
the grape it's like it's hard but it's
not doable just kind of like sit
yourself down and focus yeah usually get
crank it out or you study with friends
that's all I would see my friend that's
a really good idea too I was also an Ivy
student and had no life for me I bought
a party with like a study party I'm not
going to a party chose a good way to
study with your friends I think some
friends are really good to study with it
I was just like you don't get anything
good find your group that's the study
group because I've had
but it's a good group yeah someone asked
was how to fit in not doing it don't
know like literally bu it's like my
biggest piece of advice and I know it's
like cheesy in life whatever yeah but
honestly like bu do what you want to do
to do it actually interest to you don't
everybody be cool exactly is you're
gonna grow up and you're gonna be like
oh yeah I wish I would have just lived
my high school experience and not stuff
so worried don't move along exactly
don't graduate okay it's over we just
got to focus on being yourself because
that's where you find your like true
friends I me a solid group like that's
just when everything falls into place
don't care what everyone else is doing
and I'm telling you when you graduate
high school like all of my friends right
now are the coolest friends of what we
have in my entire life
and like I didn't meet any of them high
school yeah I'll look over winners all
my friends are like Gabby had no privacy
I was an Ivy student and that was my
thing I liked it yeah I'm still care
people thought of me I wish it yeah no
that's good in freshman year I was like
oh yeah trying to like because freshman
I just feel like you want to like be the
perfect person you can be and so
everyone likes to whatever but honestly
like sophomore you're just like I cut
away from that completely I was like I'm
just going to do my own thing I'm the me
and that's where I got my tricks
yeah that is where I got my two friends
and I just like started actually
enjoying high school how do you defeat
Mean Girls you kind of don't you just
don't you realize with our commutes
doesn't matter
don't pay attention the thing that I
realize is like people being mean to you
they just want attention
oh yeah and if you give it to them
they're going to keep being mean to you
so you just have to like look at them
and just walk away like no like I'm
better than this like you know exactly
not today like don't find fired fire
don't do anything either favorite person
it was like when I was a little spoiler
thrown into a dumpster and I was driving
out you know I went on and I took a
picture of the doctor and I go look at
me now I have that that is great so good
yeah I was tossing I was tossing dr.wily
there's some newly enrolled plushies or
they figured out no no no selecting me
oh yeah that makes me so sad that people
actually exist
oh yeah so if that's happening to you
like you're not alone that happened to
me honestly if that's happening you like
hit me up on Twitter I'll tweet them be
like stop okay no we got no the social
media at you or Yahoo how do you get
like your first date nice cool okay
honestly like dates are finding out like
non-existent so maybe just a my high
school but no honestly like it's the
people I honestly have never been on a
date
like I don't think reading and I hung
out with them but I haven't been like at
a sit-down like dinner I think that in
high school it's just more like chill
you know it's not like as we're gonna go
on a day like we're gonna go get formal
and we're gonna do this like I
definitely know people who do that and
like great for them that's awesome but I
wouldn't worry about it if you can't get
a date because that's like not super
common thing like that's when you get
older people are like oh I'll pick you
up 8:00 o'clock whatever presented high
school like your mom has to drive is
there anyone that we still have gone
dude I think I've been on like one day
this guy was like yeah this is a date
it's like don't sweat it if you're not
going on a lot of dates States hang out
their friends on half what exactly
spacing what do you do when you keep
losing breasts because of your anxiety
Oh like I still about anxiety the
dry-ice was so bad you just focus on
yourself and like if you're gonna lose
friends and our friends people that
really care about you will be there for
everything definitely people always come
back around to you high school people
are so fickle like I'm your friend and I
hope you're proud like it's yeah for
moms too people are just like movies
that I've had friends that will ignore
me for straight up a week and then oh my
god I love you just like like hey click
on my text about it when it's but like I
agree with you I I had really bad
anxiety middle school and I think that
that's honestly how you find your true
friends like the people who stick with
you and will help you through it and
like who you feel comfortable enough to
talk about it with like if you're losing
friends from is that they're not they're
not your friends no enough thing I was
like even in like an AI school middle
school like I was literally bottom of
the totem pole of this school in life
not I'm fine now yeah look I don't know
if I can move I'm living the life that I
wish I everyone's asking like I was like
a 21-2 still like that I might be living
now my life so it's like you just are
destined and you put one card work over
like all these other things people think
are important at school all the kids are
going to be growing up are look like
legitimately served me and all the other
day know that is get a stick which
there's no shame in working it in and
out
funny thing like just being like you're
making my rent rising oh my gosh they
have bluefin sushi served at the event
you need to go really I've never had
that I have places to show okay
consider yourself under my wing though
someone asks a good way to make new
friends sports and clubs is it yeah I
honestly I did a couple clubs but then I
just didn't because like it took up my
lunchtime nose my nose my finger if they
are funds that like I was just a sucker
for my lunchtime that's like my favorite
I'm over it
I met a lot of my really good friends
like from other friends that I might not
even be friends of now but like they
introduced me to them and I feel like we
can hang out in groups like don't be
afraid to say yes to hang out with a
group of people even if you don't know
them because I remember I made most of
my good friends from going to a hangout
with I only need one person per day
there's a big group of people and now
I'm best friends with all those people
who are they not on and on the person
inside maybe that's amazing in high
school like you can't force either no
it's kind of kind of just like you find
her girl exactly people an extra weird
is more on the story you'll be alive
you'll be good them it'll be not good
you also how do you become popular
principal you don't ya know focus on it
definitely no I feel like if that's what
you want to do in high school you got
the wrong mindset
yeah because popularity is not something
you need to like be happy I feel like
also even at my high school we don't
have a popular we my school is so big we
did
because important endeavor yeah I guess
clicks get like there's no like cooler
or less quickly Bueller I mean they're
probably on something I never had that
experience like the Mean Girls walking
down looks like slow motion
I never had that well if that's your
school it's a Glenn we were saying
earlier you just kind of find your
little thing and it like to be popular
just means that what school like you
because you're nice to them exactly my
hair looks awful I like yeah I feel like
also in high school when a lot of people
say like they want to be popular they
want to get known by a lot of people
yeah but I think the best type of
popular to be is like on good terms of
everything yeah like libro it's nice to
her you can just like say hi like you
walk through the halls you say hi like
almost everyone just like Haley like you
like know people like on a name basis
for song you're best friends with
everyone but you're not like popular in
a bad way or ekron like knows like oh
she's the popular yeah because I feel
like that can go to people's tents
totally so I'd be popular in high school
kind seriously just be kinda beautiful
with the have courage you because I'd
advise for presenting in front of the
class ooh this is some page we really
got I'm not really good at really eyes
you just present to your parents if you
literally injure my with it like what's
the worst that's gonna happen your
jokowi think but that's not that bad as
one who died yeah I think something that
I sir doing is I was just completely
myself like I had fun with it
like I feel like you get to appoint me
like feel comfortable with your class
which I would just say anything I want
to say yeah and it wasn't like I it's
like filter up get up my leg like I
liked presenting because it's just like
you're talking to a group of friends
first like picture you're like alone in
your room just having fun with it
but like don't make it like don't stress
about it make it a big deal on how you
baking they could care less donít like
this no it was so they're going to be
like oh wow you like messed up a word
when you topic no there honestly I
thought you'd be like maybe do believe
you're on their phone just like and
they're also so stressed about their own
presentation that they learned it or not
gonna pay attention you know was gonna
walk another pod server only let you do
CLS presentation design well know what
that guy and the teachers like no it's
really hard so we're pretty sympathetic
I just want to see you do well so high I
just worry about have courage be kind
yeah to like your boyfriend okay don't
high school boys are the worst like
you're gonna like I'm obviously so just
yeah there's going to be the cute ones
and that you're in the stable one thing
is gonna be like well I want to think
yeah well you realize you're like oh you
suck good it's fine you can find this
voice yes don't be to yourself find a
best friend
I think that's honestly something that
I've learned because I never really
ended and I feel like people paid one
because it like I like
yeah you know or like they just want to
be in a relationship but I honestly
think it's the best if I think in
general we're going to find a genuine
friend and then you let realize you like
the more than that but you're already so
close or it's like it's just easy it's
not really safe and it's like you think
about like I think about what the
happiest couples I saw in her school
work the two kids are like we should be
together we see two kids that were like
we are best friends on swim team and now
we're doing senior year anyway actually
they end up there like still together
right and boy to this College it's like
it's crazy you just realize also that it
in like 0.1 percent of high school
sweethearts actually actually read work
out like you have to look at it as it's
just like a life experience yeah like so
many foolish yourself boys the right
guys get it and I come at some point you
know you just have to wait for that
moment and like not force it yeah the
boys it's crazy because every single guy
that I'm actually dated it's if I didn't
need finer the audacity and I was a
corny you I didn't want you here yo you
so nice yeah definitely I agree this was
so fun it was like not even have to do
that
was it like weird it's like big backbone
I suppose nigga cuz I was like oh my god
