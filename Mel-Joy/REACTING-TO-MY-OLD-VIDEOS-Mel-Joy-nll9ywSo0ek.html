video because I have not like sat down
and watched my own videos like a lot of
them since I don't even remember there's
been times I've been uh friends i'ma
watch like a video or two and I'll be
like shocked at what I'm saying what I
look like what I'm doing so I could not
think of a better video than to sit down
and react to my old videos I'm a little
nervous for this but I'm also really
excited I don't really know which one
and also really quickly it before we get
into the video if you're new to my
channel you haven't seen my face before
what is up my name is mouth if you want
to stay updated on my videos every
single week and hopefully more I'm
trying to improve my upload game then
subscribe if you want the button is down
below I faith you know where it is cuz I
don't let's do this we're in it to win
it I hate your buzz I never wear earbuds
they literally always follow my ear oh
right I don't even know what we're about
to start with I want to start early
early in the days I don't know okay I
already know this video is a mess but I
haven't seen it in so long and it's my
vampire makeup tutorial for Halloween
oh my god that's thumbnail is just not
cute oh my god pause I have a lisp with
these in like listen to me
different so today I'm going to be doing
a vampire makeup tutorial for Halloween
oh my god I'm literally the last words
this makeup looks like complete now
first of all I remember doing this
background this was literally a sheet I
found and I taped it to my wall and let
your butt is falling out but this makeup
oh and my eyebrows select oh and I just
didn't have eyebrows it just wasn't a
thing for me
oh my god I'm gonna be honest when I
started filming this video I did not
know what
doing and I think it's quite obvious I
didn't have any idea of a look and I
have purple orange black all my eye is a
scary makeup look not like holy nama
Mela come on it's just scary makeup like
not a sexy sultry yeah obviously mal
look at yourself god damn really I'm
about to ditch these earbuds I'll tell
you that
oh no yeah it over this list I'm not
video I'm done with this video the intro
was enough for me
this is so weird okay only my private
videos oh okay okay okay no why did this
happen use what is this nephews one of
the videos that actually like started to
get my channel going and stuff like that
was my Instax Mini 8 camera review slash
demo 2014 I don't wanna watch this for
dinner at least I changed my intro I
can't I'm literally like this is so
weird
also if my eyes are tearing up it's not
because I'm emotional about this a very
sensitive eyes and they studio lights
are the lightweight killing my eyes my
voice is so high once again the eyebrows
I feel like I just talk I do this a lot
we're gonna go a little bit higher into
my channel where I have eyebrows and
I've kind of hit puberty a little more
with ten ways to have the best year ever
okay I wanna watch this I don't know how
I can have the best year ever
I don't even like remember when I said
this video that's so weird like it's so
weird to see like how I did my makeup so
differently in like I was really into
the eyeliner
my eyebrows are so thick in this thicker
than they are Danny
thick I'm talking so quietly and the
music is so loud it's like I would never
have the best year ever continue oh my
god it's so long a job I was so chilled
why am I so like weird no my voice I'll
blow in this and it doesn't you know
what I don't know I think I'm going back
in time and I'm like revisiting my past
and I like to live in the present and
not really focus on the past let's stare
truth or dare with Collins oh I miss
Collins in my neck my voice does anyone
remember when that was my intro hey guys
it's me now you've got to get the it's
part it's me I can't even do it anymore
that's my fury hey guys how do I do that
how I made my voice go so high okay
continuing eyebrows are so thick here
too cause I look the same tightness
that's not accurate it's like oh fuck
taller than me what also my hair ties
black and nude I wouldn't do that math
is like OCD girl make them both black
and make them both noon what are you
doing in my eyelash extensions oh can we
talk about that phase a phase where I
had eyelash extensions I would get them
filled all the time it happened for like
five months and then it happened again
like months later long story short I
don't like eyelash extensions anymore
mm-hmm not a fan maybe I'll get them for
like special occasions but instead of my
own videos I just can't watch them
because my eyelashes are just so freakin
crazy in there let's watch one of my
eyelash extensions all right let's do
this
I've dated summer makeup routine summer
2016
it's a year ago a little more than a
year ago these ads though malla not
subscribing my eyelashes there's so long
these ones were the first like types I
got and they were just so like thin but
so long which i guess is better than
being like no they're crazy
it's not bad but like big
when I was like under way I don't know
very I went there face I've talked about
my channel many a times where I was just
so healthy I don't even realize how much
weight I was losing but girl my
cheekbones are poppin that's why YouTube
is so misleading I look at my old videos
that I'm like oh I look like healthy my
face looks good but if you look at the
rest of my body or if you did back then
it's like girl you need to eat some food
so it's weird you choose can be so
misleading my gum 800 walking with
Olivia okay summer clothing off we look
so itty-bitty oh my god lamb but this is
so live you look so cute and your hair
you look so cute it ah let's do a
jewelry line announcement buy my jewelry

came out don't what you I just want to
see bear and I'm doing my first like
successful videos on YouTube it's
actually like still one of my most
popular videos the boys guesses prices
of girly items with Jackson we were so
small we were such fuses is this
freshman year oh my god my intro
bloopers was like 30 seconds it's just
too long Jackson voice is so high this
is so weird
so you're just roasting myself not bad
hello my name is Jackson yeah typical us
which he's still such a weirdo I'm so
such a weirdo but that's just so funny
ok triangle swimsuit I shouldn't have
bought that I never wore it
it broke like the first time I was like
a hundred dollars 25 questions nobody
asks let's see this I don't even
remember the question who slashed my
answers I'm excited to learn more about
myself my background is super cute so my
makeup was
I talk so quietly I used to be so chill
yeah yeah I used to manual focus for the
first time today that's all I use now
look at that you always got to start
somewhere
sorry I can blurry throughout the video
yeah why okay I will mean my lips is
good how did I do that
weirdo with that one oh okay okay okay I
wanted to watch some of my videos where
I would take the out of my face
part of my language but I remember
seeing one of them and I was just like
is my face like real okay okay I have a
kid my camera died I don't know what I
said right when it clicked on this video
I was just shocked my spring/summer
Tryon home okay so this is when I got
extensions I hate the Frick out of my
face like that's not a bad thing but I
just look really really caked like I
don't even know how I managed to get
that much bigger with the highlighter
it's probably the highlighter I went a
little crazy with the highlighter back
in the day or like a lot crazy with
natural beauty guys less is more I know
what I look like without all this and I
think I look much better without all of
this extra stuff on my face we're done
with this but like well like that's fun
to do sometimes but I don't know how I
did that so often let's watch my
everyday makeup routine winter 2016 it's
sad that these are only a year ago but I
feel like it completely like I don't
even know oh my hair it was natural my
makeup looks better here not escaped
less quo I'm not I'm not mad at myself
with this makeup let's split you know
pretty good I prefer to wear less now
but people change and we figure out what
we like let's watch my what's on my
iPhone 6s how I edit my Instagram photos

I feel like this I swear to god I'm
hearing a cat or I'm going my tool

my style is changed that's good I feel
like people who go through change

went to school to I wore this to school
