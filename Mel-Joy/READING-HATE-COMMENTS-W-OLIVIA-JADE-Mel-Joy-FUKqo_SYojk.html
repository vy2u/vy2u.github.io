Nara style we always focus on the
positivity but I'd be honest I just
thought this would be funny yeah we
thought would be funny because we never
address hate right there's times where I
wanna address eight I just think to be
the bigger person and not but today
we're giving the hair some attention no
haters Bissell's for you
dedicated to our haters only that really
means I got my redeeming you I'm
literally getting mad at the comments
are saying they go we're going to start
with one of the most controversial
things we as a conference controversial
controversial they say like that we're
gonna serve our most controversial
gonna start with one of the most
confrontational things but most channel
obviously loved
about it yeah forget about it this is a
good is it probably it's so obvious
she fills in her eyebrows so this goes
like way way way I also like to mention
this has six life and quite a few
replied doesn't identify over yeah thank
you for those people that like stand up
video stops enough turns ng ah she
showed me self filling in an idiot walk
to the video the hair goes who the suc
you talking to like that you've been
dying a whole no we like you why
clearly she is fighting some internal
issues for real no response honey wow
you got me I'm crying now that really
offended me okay you're good when
they're coming back there's a lot of
people say about this like a lot it's
really really badly my cell my eyebrows
and I think they grow back thicker dunno
I mean since I'm lucky it was the mango
shows us something ups reason but I did
do a video all my eyebrows and I
explained that I don't fill them in but
now I do
right but like s would be any of online
videos when I don't make it when she
posted that video yeah she didn't fill
her husband
people just have this idea that I just
say guys enough I just say I don't fill
my eyebrows I even put this on my
snapchat like a year ago
obviously I'm taking on makeup remover
wipe and like wiping off my eyebrows
Alessi's no product yeah and I can
honest to god fair that she like when
she was asleep she doesn't have makeup
on my face we and her eyebrows look the
same so but we'll see you in our next
let's stay in your own lane and have a
good one
good everybody go to church and I'm
gonna eat Olivia one these just make me
mad like I don't know so it's on your
blog right and it says you look like
Michael Jackson after new surgery
drops put a picture I might go back to
the guy here
jealous friends like null verse Michael
like you would a man but taking off
surgery and I was a little notable but
live here is a little natural I can do
dances like Michael Jackson - what's
rebuttal don't you remember
I found a photo for you that it look
like Michael Jackson after a surgery I'm
just gonna have to say a blind eye
clearly like that is wrong outrageous
statement I said never hurts what you
want the cocaine what you want the
shrooms and whatever we're tripping
definitely put it okay mouth museum is
closed this girl of anger your how you
spend your money being a girl is an
expensive being a girl who buys leggings
for eighty two dollars and a bikini for
a hundred dollars is expensive yeah this
one is from the videos Jackson the girls
get pricey
you know the guys guess priming all you
guys yeah whatever you got it pretty
much are shown my Lulu Lemon leggings
which I love that like a big thing
everywhere but we're out on the big you
know people really like them and they're
really raised about and for me that
really comfortable story just really
scratch so for me I'll rather spend
money on things I will have for a very
long time and I know I like and it's
comfortable and for leggings I think
there's a lot of problems like Caesar
stuff you know I mean all Travis did it
affect your wallet I'm sorry I really
have to call video we're talking about
these $80 lighting right it's the
biggest thing ever
how does that affect you so they are own
lanes are delighting Zion and I'm after
you don't looking I am by the way they
make your boat great oh yeah worth every
real Oh come at me people come at me my
qual your Rob - okay there's like two
things I don't like in a sentence one I
lost it I just lost the thing that's no
offense which is already like you know
it's gonna be if you already said
something offend you are they know
then she said I love you I love you and
all social Anu and all I love you and
all but why exactly what is the next
thing you would try to be like cheney
grim and Shani grim and undergrad mother

alike but I don't know how I try and be
like an australian youtuber like i am
straight-up american i don't even sound
like her like if i was like hey i'm
welcome back to my channel maybe I've
tried to like Shani River but I'm
American and she way funnier and way
cooler than me so I don't know how to
try and be someone I guess I'm just
myself and I'm just so lucky - I like
