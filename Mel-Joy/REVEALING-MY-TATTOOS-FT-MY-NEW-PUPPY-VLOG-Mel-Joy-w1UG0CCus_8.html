had anything that we were looking for we
well I get cool you know like cool
colors and they had mostly like everyday
wear like natural-looking wigs the only
one I liked was $390 and I was like girl
we decided why not go to San Francisco
like 20-30 minutes depending traffic but
we're gonna make a trip down there and
go to a wig factory up there my bad if
you don't get a wig there I'll be pissed
because it's quite the trip but it's
okay we'll do it for the vlog what else

viewfinder okay so we decided to stop a
jack-in-the-box ood and
we're hungry and we're going to City so
you know I need that nutrients are there
making this ladies we need those in
order to bring no food so he's watching
this yeah win this today oh my god oh my

price they were on sale $30 wigs are
usually like a lot I just put this on
for fun and show you guys but you might
wake Saffy literally just want this for
what I just want to like change my hair
one day and not have to get it done
you know because that's really bad for
your hair I don't know I feel it's
really tripping it like what um I'm
scared I wish you didn't get a new wig
this is so weird it looks good it's just
we're gonna drive home we don't want
traffic to get bad um and what time's
the traffic from traffic is gonna be so
bad so keep you posted this is such a
weird feeling yeah baby

wants to go outside but he found this
place that's like under the stairs he
like loves hiding in any place you can
find he just hides in cupboards or in
little cabinets don't you Bubba but he's
gonna get big soon you can't do that

sharp teeth though showed him your
little tease out Travis play with your
toy there were two tennis balls on this
and look look what he did
oh my you are crazy he will literally
bite anything to anything look at the
shoe RIT yeah yeah I know that's your
shoe now no Travis it's so far trying to

bite your shoe no no no Travis half
angel half devil oh my god yo look at me
you bite your toys not humans no toy toy
and like these are supposed to be as pee
pads any jerseys up to hello what you
what right Jack please don't bite me you
are look at this fool okay ow
I love him so much but I did not realize
that having a dog is literally like
having a newborn I mean my parents
really warned me and said that having a
dog is like having a newborn like a
puppy like this outdrive I strive that
it's literally like having a newborn it
takes up a lot of time and of course I
was expecting that with this little
puppy like filming videos and stuff even
like trying to take a shower is so hard
he always needs attention don't you
today one of my friends is gonna come
over and watch him I think so I can go
get him more puppy supplies because he
can't go in the store yet the vet said
and I need to get him food and I think I
want to get him like I don't really like
crates
because I feel like that's like a little
gate he could hang in I have gates till
I close off doorways and stuff but I
don't have like a little gate that like
restricts him from running around the
whole house
and I realized he's a little dog and he
needs to be restricted at first to
understand he cannot bite everything and
eat everything and be hey I think I'm
just giving him a little too much
freedom but I like oh you just bit the
side of me but before my friend comes
over
I was just gonna get some business stuff
done read some emails respond to some
emails and also just make sure Travis
doesn't do anything he shouldn't be
doing there's a lot of videos coming
this week I didn't upload on Saturday
and I felt really bad for that but I
didn't like how the video turned out so
I'm uploading this and then I'm gonna
upload other videos oh my god along with
this one this week hey puppy
what so I have to pre film those videos
he just hit my hand when he's in this
crazy mood it's it's a little scary so
I'm gonna go try to tame him huh BRB the
baby is fine
this fool is so funny he can literally
sleep in any position and you try to
touch him in his sleep really pick him
up he gets really mad and growls
cuz he's like hey leave me alone I'm
sleeping watch oh you're up baby it's
like what are you doing dude I'm trying
to sleep all his feet are crossed you
are so cute his foots just shown here
what's up now in the car and I'm going
to the pet store to get some stuff for
the dog my friend just watching him
right now I don't want to leave him
alone yet and I want to get food because
I'm so hungry I need some food</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
