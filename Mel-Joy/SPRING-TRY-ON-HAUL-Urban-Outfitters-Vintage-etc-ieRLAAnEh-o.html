how are you guys doing I hope you don't
get it I really still wanna stop so just
stick with me here and if you made my
channel what is up my name is Mel it is
great to meet you I would really
appreciate it if you click that
subscribe button down below
IFE no I faith you know her and if
you're new to my channel and you don't
know that I state the sizing and the
pricing and every single one of my hauls
then well you know it's almost like
original YouTube I feel like I know a
lot of people don't do it these days but
I like to know how much something is and
what size it's in you know it's helpful
when it comes to shopping and stuff so
if you want to get on that you can just
click out or just ignore the price in
the same thing which will be BAM right
there and big I'm gonna be honest
I've been shopping a little too much
when Mel gets in a mood I just turn it
to something and just swiping that
credit card
I really think retail therapy is a thing
um it's I'm a fan could not put
everything I got in one haul it would be
like a movie and it's so bad but I'm
just I'm gonna hide my credit card for
myself and hide any way of just
purchasing anything this is only the
first of many halls you guys always ask
for follow so hopefully you're not
completing my walls completing them so
just stay tuned this is not the only
home it's just a lot more but I'm like
so happy with everything I've bought I
know a lot of people think my style is
changed but I think style doesn't like
define who you are as a person or
anything I just a passion is just it's
become a very big thing for me and just
trying to find out what I like it things
like that I don't really notice even
that my style changes because I'm always
just do with me and I'm doing like what
I like but yes my style is changed
obviously I'm not the same 15 year old I
wasn't I started my channel but I just
wear what I feel like where
great and I love it without further ado
let's just
I have everything behind me or most of
the things as you can tell I've been
cold I feel like the only jackets I have
or like hoodies yes so these are like
cute I love hoodies but you can't wear a
lot of outfits with the hoodie just
because you know it covers your shirt
and things like that so I just went on
the jacket free kidding I don't know I
ran with it
I ran out of it with oh my god I went on
a jacket extravaganza I I have worn it
like every single one so the first one
I'll start with this is massively
oversized camo jacket and the reason
it's so big it's because I got from
urban and I could have gotten an extra
small but I've got the small because
they're sold out I think it's a guy's
jacket too which would explain why it's
so big on me but it's just camel and it
keeps me so bored like yeah I'm into the
oversized look I think I've always been
into that look I don't know I like I
like it I also got this at urban and it
says it's from on it or something and I
actually looked up with this mint and it
means something French so when someone's
like oh this on that and you say
something French it'll be like yeah what
in the French and I'll be like something
primitive like that's literally what it
means so it's funny it tricks a lot of
people I got it in a size large because
it was the only size left and it was
like 30 bucks and I think it used to be
like 60 or something I don't know it was
a really good price for a hoodie on
urban so you know I had to snatch it I
also got this jacket whoa
I also got this jacket from Urban
Outfitters it has two pockets right here
like a cropped box leather jacket and
the reason I got a lot of this stuff is
because it was on sale so I'll have the
sale prices down below not the regular
prices this one's like tighter and
shorter than pretty much the rest of my
coat so this is just like feeling a
little earlier in but okay
also from urban it's just this orange
and not a cook jacket and it says not a
good competition on it and then the back
looks like my pants I think the blue
looks really cool with it this is a
men's section yeah it's an extra-small
it still has that oversized look on me I
like it I also got this jacket from
Urban it's fresh out of my comfort zone
a little bit but I wanted to try it and
it was also a really good price it's on
sale and they had it in an extra small
it sounds like the same almost what is
this I want something I know the name
from urban I got these pants but I don't
know if I'm gonna keep them I really
like the style
they're like the adidas track pants and
then have like this design at the bottom
but I got them in a size small I think
but they're like way too big almost like
even when I overlap them and tie them
they still like fall out of it but
they're like so cute and the color is
really cute so maybe you might keep
these as like an oversized look might
return them maybe get a smaller size if
that happen that would probably be the
best alternative mouth you should see my
Center right now with my life is about
well I like this one thing justice from
I'm Coco la they sent me some stuff and
this is one of the things and I'm just
oh my god I'm upset it's just this like
camo jacket I don't know what I I don't
know what material this is but it's
really comfortable it's more crops than
like a regular jacket
I guess everything they have is so cute
and they're my favorite they know I love
them
so these pants are from I'm Coco la they
also sent me these you're just like
black and white camel pants these are
super cute they're really in and have
been really I think they have a good
amount of colors on I'm Coco la so if
you want like you know just the basic
aim uh pants then go there they also
sent me this super cute shirt it's just
Harley Davidson I love love love Harley
Davidson and came out so you girls happy
about it another thing I got from them
is in the wash I try really hard to find
it then I realized seams in the wash
it's a white cropped tank top that has
rips up here I'll into the picture here
it was on my Instagram I posted a pic
with it Atmel doctor from Oakland I
thought I'll put that in it also has a
little Harley Davidson a patch on it but
I think it's really cute and it's like
one of my favorite just like basic white
tops now to like wear with license stuff
you feeling this one is from I am dia
it's just red this is like a very
popular coat you've probably seen it in
like tan and black and whatever but I
think it's the pixie coat I could be
wrong I'm pretty sure sexy code this
isn't an extra-small and it's pretty
oversized like five four I think so if
you're on my height I will get this one
unless you're like really want to get
oversized cuz this is like pretty big on
me but it's like perfect like a coat I
feel like and it just has these big
pockets which I love wait wasn't this oh
that's thick that's it look so to branch
out of my comfort zone I got this orange
puffer vest
it's from Tommy Hilfiger it's from
Frankie's collective I'll love Frankie's
collective they have me cutest vintage
stuff you're like if I make this
oh look like it'll be all look you feel
me like uh look I'm good I also got this
from Frankie's collected and this is
just a whole vibe I'm in love with
anything that
look like you're a race car driver or
like anything if you guys didn't know my
dream is to be a drag racer really cool
sports I don't know but it's just a
vintage jacket and doesn't it look like
a racecar driving that you can't tell me
does it
also from Frankie's collective I just
got this vintage Nike jacket and it's
purple with orange detailing and I think
it's so cute like zipped up it looks
really cute and then open to I feel like
a lot of people wouldn't think to our
orange and purple together but I really
like it your girl is up there I'm
wearing like a very similar one breaker
right now is also from Frankie's
collective and it's like you disappear
from Frankie's collective I also got
these pants from MD does avail button
like so like windbreaker material and
they're pretty like big but I think they
look really cute with like a crop top
I'm gonna ponytail we're something like
that so yeah so I also got these sweats
from shadow Hill and they're just great
champion sweat pants that say shadow on
them and I think the orange on the gray
looks really cute I'm kind of in sweats

think that's everything I'm gonna show
