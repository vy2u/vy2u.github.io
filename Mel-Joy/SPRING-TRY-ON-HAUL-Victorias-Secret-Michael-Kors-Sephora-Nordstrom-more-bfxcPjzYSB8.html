much coffee shit my chair is spinning me
there has been something in my art for
straight up oh I'm gonna be crying this
whole video was I think I literally
cannot operable with the natural here
today one because I'm lazy too because
why not hey guys it's me
Mel so today's video is going to be a
very requested video a spring haul yes
try on as well um it is a new season we
just acknowledge the fact that it gets
darker later and I did some shopping so
I thought why wouldn't I show you guys
what I got because you guys really want
to see it my wallet is nothing happiest
with me right now what are you gonna do
without further ado but let's just get
started in this video if you guys are
new to my channel then you don't know
that I say the prices and my sizes of
things I have done this and all my hauls
and I will continue to do so because I
get a lot of good feedback on it I know
a lot of people don't like it when I do
it cuz they think I'm trying to show off
my size or how much something is but
really I've always loved it because if
I'm similar to their size I don't know
what size I got of it and if it's
something that I want to buy I don't
know how much it is a lot of you guys
have told me to keep doing it for the
people who don't like that you can
commute me when I say my sizes and the
prices a lot of people have given me
good feedback on it so that's why I
continue to do so going back to the
video probably the biggest purchase of
this season for me a Michael Kors purse
I got this purse I loved it so I really
don't actually have like a purse like
this or have a good sized purse that I
can just take around whatever so I got
this one I was gonna get a smaller size
when it came I was a little too small so
I decided to get this one instead the
Selvi medium satchel leather purse it's
in ballet really keep names just as
gorgeous moody pink color and the reason
I decided to get this it was on sale
usually three hundred and fifty eight
dollars and I got it for like 130 150 I
was like if I'm gonna get a purse this
is definitely the time to get it I'm
really happy with it
another thing that I've had for a while
but I haven't show you guys which I
thought I would which is also from
Michael Kors I got this a while ago but
it is a keychain thingy and I have my
keys on there right now it kind of
matches not funny except the detailing
is different color so I know
oh just gonna put it in my purse like
half reddish maroon and then half la
pinky nude color and I really like it
and this I think is $48 there's some
crazy ones out there like Fendi that are
like thousand as like this will do so I
got this purse and if you guys want to
see it what's in my purse video let me
know comment down below or like this
video I can do that for you guys I'm
just really excited to own a purse and
then the next place that I got that
stuff from is Victoria's Secret for
really really quickly

an app so if you're online shopping on
your phone which I do a lot you can use

that I want to share with you guys cuz I
saved a good
money on that and I think that it's
something that literally everyone should
have I'm not even joking because it
saves you so much money so yeah probably
want to share with you guys because the
next things I bought I used the eBay
coupon code from victoria's secret from
Ebates it's almost summer which means
it's swimsuit season and I'm so excited
because I love swimsuits they're so cute
I'll start with the bottom so I got
these adorable black bottoms they're
just plain black but I think that it's
such a good basic to have and it says
Victoria's Secret with a little gold bar
they're like or they call they only had
them in black so this is like the black
bikini bottoms they're not like too
cheeky but they're like the right amount
and I think it's really cute price tag
isn't on it but I think it was like
20-something I just got in an
extra-small and then these are so girly
and cute also from Victoria's Secret and
an extra small ruffled on the butt and
then the front is plain and they're like
a little cheeky when you wear them but
it makes your butt look really good same
with the black ones and they're just so
cute and I love a style I don't own
anything like this and that was I think
about like 20 something they're both
like 20 something this talk to go with
them both is a super cute bandeau top
it's called the like sport bandeau top
or something it also comes with a strap
i just got this in assam mall looks like
that it's similar to the triangle
swimsuits I didn't get it because it was
like the triangle some suits the zipper
doesn't actually go down all the way so
we won't flash anyone just good it's
really cute I'm excited to wear those
things in the summertime the next place
that I got some stool from was pack stud
they had some pretty cute clothes so the
first thing was aspera shorts because
it's getting Potter out you can also
just really cute lounge shorts if
anything's wrinkled I'm sorry it's kind
of thinking of sitting in a bag but
they're kind of like you know those
lifeguard looking shorts but they're in
like a navy blue color and these are
from brandy melville or john galt
for 17 dollars and it's in just a
one-size it's all and they're really
cute and comfortable brandy melville has
the most comfortable fabric and then the
next thing I got is this hat I think
it's so cute
it says la on it and whenever I wear it
people like me like any Dodgers I like
it because I want to live in LA when I'm
older and it's a cute color
and I I just love I like so yeah I don't
want to work for the rest of the video
but I won't or do I know it's from
American Needle this was like $20 I took
the price tag off because I've been
wearing it I really like this and I
think I'm gonna be wearing it a lot the
next thing they were having like a buy
one get one half off jeans so I picked
up two pairs of jeans and one of them
was already on sale but then it was also
on sale again so they're like super
cheap and they were these really really
dark emerald green skinny jeans and they
are the mid-rise skinniest jeans and I
got them in a size 23 and they're
adorable I love them they kind of look
black but then they also green in the
right lighting they're really
comfortable and they're really cute and
I really like them and these were I
don't know the exact price but I think I
got them for somewhere around 20 dollars
or less which is crazy for like a nice
pair of jeans so it's very half about
that and then the jeans that I bought to
get those half off maybe these are half
up I don't really remember while ago for
these white jeans and guys I've been
looking for white jeans for so long
literally since Christmas time and I
couldn't ever find a cute pair that like
fit me or was a style I wanted or
anything and then I found these I was
like yeah and they're so cute through
the mid rice candies ankle they're like
ankle jeans those are like really in
style right now I wasn't sure if I like
them or not but now I have two pairs of
jeans like that and I actually like them
and these are in a size 24 this little
mud stay on here ignore that if you try
to get that out my friend done don't do
my back and I fell and got some one of
my fans but they have holes in both of
the knees like some distressing can you
see can you see them they're so so cute
I posted picture on my Instagram of me
and then so if you guys want to see that
I should or next room so that's
everything I got at PacSun and really
quickly I'm going to show you guys to
beauty products that I picked up and I
was not clothing but you know so the
first thing is this NARS concealer and
oh my goodness guys I was at Sephora
trying to find the other product that I
bought there lady was helping me and I
was like what concealer
it looks so good like oh the nurse can
see what I like all right I need to get
it looking sealer I just now just wasn't
really working for me and I got it in
vanilla and this is just the radiant
creamy concealer and I am obsessed with
this it was pretty expensive it was $29
but honestly it's so worth it I love
this stuff and then the next thing which
is what I went to Sephora for it was
this Laura Mercier translucent powder
and this is just a loose powder that
I've heard so many people rave about so
I wanted to get my hands on it and I've
been looking for a loose setting powder
for so long I literally like don't have
any and I just use this to set my under
eye concealer and the rest of my face
and this is just the mini size but
there's a lot of product in here just
like $20 I think 20 or 25 or something
but I had a Sephora gift card from like
sixth grade so I use that as we have
about it so I got these two products and
I've been loving both of them then the
next place I went to was Calvin Klein I
kept the bad because it was some cute
but it was an outlet in LA when I went
to LA a while ago but I never shown it
in a video so I thought I would I just
got to the gray Calvin Klein bralette I
have the black one and I'm obsessed with
these I think they're so cute and
they're so comfortable too I just got
that and that was like twenty dollars or
something because it was the outlet
let's see is this it no one like $22 but
they're usually 28 so I was good with
that too then the next place I went to
was forever 21 and I literally had not
shopped here in so long guys so when I
went they had a lot of cute things so
the first thing I got was this crop top
and it is like this ribbed crop top it
looks really small - judges what kind of
neck is this I don't even know what type
of egg this is but it's like a high
straight line neck kind of like halter
but not I don't know and it's two straps
the back is a little lower but it's so
comfortable and cute and I'm very
excited to wear this I got it in a small
and it was 1090 so that is a good deal
and then the next thing going along the
line of black tank tops I definitely
feel like this is a staple that I don't
have in my closet right now so I'm
really happy I do now but it isn't a
small I was 490 so that's really cheap
and it's really cute just like a halter
crop top and then the next thing also
halter I love this shirt I wore this in
my everyday makeup routine I posted a
couple videos back and it's just high
neck
has pretty low slaves but I think it's
really cute it's not tight but it is a
crop top but it's flowy and low and it's
really cute and just in this gray color
I got it in a small and it's 990 and
then the next shirt I got sorry if it's
wrinkled was this pink box tee but I
think it's adorable I love this color
it's like a light pink I feel like it's
really in right now I got in a small and
was 790 I think that you could wear this
a lot of different ways so user just
rolled up which i think is really cute
and I like doing to my shirts so then
the next thing which is this little it's
sorry it's wrinkled I wore it put it
says cropped tank top and you can wear
this like under thing or if you just are
really hot and don't want to wear a lot
of clothing I got it in a small and it
was 190 so it's super super affordable
and I'm wearing it a lot just like under
things when I need it so those are all
really affordable pieces and is
everything I got at forever 21 I was
gonna get some other stuff but I didn't
let myself I was like Mel chill the next
place I went to was Nordstrom went to
the clearance and I found these pants
and I'm obsessed with them I was looking
for fans like this for so long there are
these like army green pants sorry if
they're wrinkled as well but they just
have these pockets here to be pretty
simple from the brand sts blue and I got
them in a size 0 and these were on sale
for like $20 $15 I don't know but they
were pretty affordable especially for
North strim I think there's a lot of
different ways that you can wear these I
kind of like made and give Kim Possible
a little bit so then the other thing I
got at Nordstrom which was a little bit
more on the pricey side but I just loved
it so much I just like you know amount
treat yourself I got this shirt and it
is this high neck kind of looks like the
fur to anyone would to be honest but I
got this one first but it's in a dark
green it's a lot longer it's not crop
top this is like a suede material so
it's such a nice materials you can see
it's like suede and then buttons just
look like this in the back a nicer shirt
if I'm going to like nicer events or
like a nice dinner or something I worked
to a nice dinner
and it's so comfortable and really cute
and I really like this cut actually were
these with the white pants the pictures
on my Instagram if you would like to see
and there's a little hole right here no
no I really liked it it was like $40 I
decided to splurge so the next thing I
got some sneakers these are from Puma I
saw people wearing Puma sneakers and
they look really cute so I was like you
know
I want fair so I got these ones at an
outlet in LA also they are just these
topi big shoes and then have the white
stripey thing and then the gold
detailing and they're really cute
they're just lace-up I really like them
so I got them in a seven and a half so I
thought so I'm sure you guys these even
