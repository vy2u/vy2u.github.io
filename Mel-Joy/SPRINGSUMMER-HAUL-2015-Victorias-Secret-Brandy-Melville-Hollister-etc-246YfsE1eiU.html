going
be good okay so today for you guys I'm
going to be doing a collective Paul some
of the stuff about today send the stuff
I got like 10 weeks ago then so uh so I
got a couple months ago so we're just
this is kind of a hole for like and
spring in the start of summer that's the
right the season I'm looking for summer
I don't have much summer clothes because
I stocked up on my winter clothes and
then I clicked at my closet guard of
like three trash bags full of stuff so I
was a little surprised to stuff so the
first place that I got a good amount of
things at is Hollister because I was in
desperate native shorts like I have one
pair that fits me
I want Hollister and they're having like
a $25 denim sale so like all our denim
started $5 so if you need jeans or
shorts out you just going there so the
first pair of shorts I got were these
umm they look really small wear these
dark denim jean shorts and they look
like this they're just dark them have a
little bit of a rips distressing but not
much and I like how they cuff at the
bottom because that's how I like once my
shorts and they're a size zero waste 24
and 25 dollars next pair they are I
didn't know if I like them or not
but when I tried them on really I did so
we were good we were Gucci these shorts
they're light denim distressed
these are not something I'm going to
wear to school because they are very
short but in all those days where you're
feeling a little funky I guess for going
to Coachella know each other but I don't
know they're cute and I don't own
anything like this at all
that's what the butt looks like and they
just really liked it I'm just dressed
though they're Hollister high rise
festival short I'll wear them to a
festival and their size zero waste 24 it
also seems that there are a pair of
shorts that I got for these uh
high-waisted black shorts woah oh I was
really white because I owned black
pirate shorts but now they don't
literally follow my body the two biggest
fat so I got these ones and I like
high-waisted black shorts I was debating
between white and black but my friends
sue over here
I think convinced me to give life
because I match with my stuff and they
look better the sizing is 125 because I
like them a little bit more roomy in the
chick to me oh because I didn't want
like billion weapon up he knows good
size think they will and then the last
pair of shorts I got in Hollister for
these white ones and I love white shorts
I think they're really cute and they
make you look tan so like you get to
enjoy their and they're just also kept
at the bottom low-rise but looks like
that and they are zero also 24 waist
then I went to pack zone and they were
having a sale at brandy Melville like
when does that happen I went and it was
20% off if you buy two or more things
like each thing would be 20% off so the
first thing I got is this shirt and it
is maroon and white stripes and I
honestly think it's so cute I love the
fit it looks really cute with the white
bra let then I chatted on with um and
this was $24 I don't know I'm not sure
what those 20% off don't feel like doing
that right now
yeah the sleeves are just looking like
that and I enjoy this shirt and it's
really soft and the second thing was
this really light pink tank top I wasn't
sure how I like this we're not in the
store but I wanted it online for the
longest time I did not really see
through it was till I got home
like you can probably see my face like I
tried almost a white Rowlett because I
think it's look really cute but you can
literally see the wiper all in through
it so I don't know how I feel about this
if it's return worthy or not it's really
soft and comfortable I would just prefer
if it wasn't completely utterly
see-through the next place I went to was
a hot topic um in this store is usually
not where I shop because it's a little
hardcore for me I was looking for band
shirts because I like I like bands and I
got this and it's the neighbourhood
but this is the NB h d the neighborhood
can have the little house on it and I
got in a size small because the extra
smells like not skin type of pretty type
of this like I can cut the sleeves in
head bottom in it looks good and this
was 20 it was buy one for yourself so I
had to get a second one because why not
and I love shirts graphic t-shirts and I
got this in a small because they didn't
have extra smell in it and it says
without music life would it be a mistake
and not so true music is life if you saw
my QA my last video one of the things I
can love that was music because I can't
it says for Frederick Nia's G definitely
said that wrong and there's a picture v
going like this behind it I like it I
got two shirts for $30 so it was like 15
bucks each shirt also an officer I got
these a while ago but why not show it I
got this boxy gray tee that looks really
cute the bralette there's like 12 bucks
and then this shirt that I have not worn
yet but it's like alternate stripe that
I thought it look you it's like a
brawler or something looks like a low
back just like ten bucks and then the
next place I went to actually I ordered
online was Victoria's Secret
if I was in desperate need of swimsuits
because I always I'm gonna try that all
too big and too small I've been so the
first one I got which I'm utterly in
love with is this white um kind of like
bra style that this white kind of it has
underwire and it has some creasing there
and it just looks thought cute but I
like forgiving love this but that came
huh yes what it looks like and for
bottoms to go out and this is like 30
something dollars Avenue and then the
bottoms I got to go with
are these uh tied either like white and
blue honestly I think it looks I think
these look so cute with the top like
Hema come on I've never had bikini
bottoms like this but it's like lived
creased in the backseat and it's kind of
cheeks Trish yeah it's cheap easy to
shoot but they look really cute with it
and as a little silver heart here which
i think looks really cute too and then
the second bikini I got was this one but
you can tell it's okay we can't tell but
it's like really small it's an extra
small and that was too small so I'm
going to take it back and get a bigger
size but I really like the style it's
like a mint color with black outline and
lining like crosses and then the bottom
I got to go with that is just the same
style but in all plain black and I got
this in a small in both bottoms yes see
it has like a little ruching there
ruching on the button everything was on
sale then this was like 60 bucks I like
some see okay and then the next thing I
got we're a rainbow flip-flops oh look
look so gross
okay I've been living in these lately
and that's why they're so like worn in
but the more they look like like the
more worn in there the more comfortable
they are like when I first got them they
were so uncomfortable is getting
blisters like Elizabeth in the more I
wore them in a secret to you guys if you
got my bow flip-flops and you don't know
how to break them in just let them like
completely soak them and then walk
around your block or like just walk
around take your dog on off whatever for
like 30 minutes to an hour and wait till
they dry and it will help break them in
because it will form to your feet and I
love how they have arch supports cuz I
love arches and these are look so
comfortable I wear them everywhere and
they're just one the light the lightest
color with the braids and I think
they're on the size
yeah but they fit perfectly so and then
the next thing I got more like on the
Beauty side of things um was this
Garnier moisture renew lotion for dry
skin gel cream and this is amazing I
would definitely suggest this my face is
like not dry at all thanks to this I use
it twice a day watch two twice a day and
I love it and it's a discipline
recommended and then the next thing I
got was the lorac Pro palette I got this
a while ago but I thought I'd show it
because it was an investment for me but
the colors are just freakin beautiful I
wear them every day and it's a good time
and then the last thing I got was this
BB cream from Benefit and I really like
it and then last thing I got was a
bucket hat but it's reversible my friend
daughter for me actually because she
needed one more thing to get free
shipping and you can either wear black
with the little truffle showing which I
think like salchow or the tropical and
we're camping I enjoy it the last thing
I got wear my new lemons and they are
just I'm wearing them right now they're
the like sport ones with the mesh and I
just wear these like for working out
just like I know I live in leggings so
these are so comfortable they're like
literally the softest things are out
you'll ever feel and these are like
pretty expensive you know Lululemon's
investment but I got them a while ago um
because I didn't have any workout
leggings I just have like yoga pant
leggings not like workout able to sweat
in leggings so these are really needed
because I am doing track yeah
