this isn't my second time so nice video
his nose is so I'm back here refill min
how you doing hello my beautiful best
friend today's video is going to be a
haul I may or may not have just filming
I'm a pro youtuber dude I said in one of
my last videos that I was going to be
doing a haul soon I didn't actually know
if I had enough clothes to do it and
then I collected all of them and I
realized Mel you do have enough clothes
and you do have a shopping problem so
like I needed to and if you're new to my
channel hello my name is mal it is great
to meet you thank you so much for
watching if you're not already
subscribed I would love it if you do so
the button is right here in all my years
of YouTube still don't know I know you
guys misses so it would make my heart
really happy if you subscribe I'm
getting on into the hole and by the way
this is a Tryon also you're going to get
to see all these clothes on the body was
innocent oh and if you're new in my
channel and you don't know that I say my
sizing and my prices and every single
piece that's what I do
I don't do it to like brag or share my
site or whatever the only reason I do it
is because I've gotten so much good
feedback from you guys so that's just
why do that if you don't want to see
that and you're gonna leave a hate
comment about it you can just click on
this video right now right now I only do
it for you guys it doesn't know better
fit me in any way shape or form so the
first place I'm going to be showing you
what i got from is urban outfitters
because urban outfitters is one of my
fave shopping online stores because i'm
too lazy to go in the actual stupid i
grabbed three pairs of shoes the first
pair of shoes I don't think I've talked
about on my channel yet and I'm obsessed
with them obsessed with them they're the
skater like vans but they have camo they
have KML people I'm obsessed with camo
camo is one of my favorite prints I love
it I like the black ones and over the
black ones a lot but the ones with the
camo just add so much and I really like
this so then I got this pair of shoes
these are from Puma pretty much it's
like creepers and not like spent hear
anything just regular Puma it's really
really pretty nude color but it's like
Pat and mother and I think it's shiny
you feel me oh so then I got these
slides from vans they look like this
they're just white kind of with yellow
checkers on them or like mustard yellow
I don't know I love love love this color
yellow has been
my favorite colors since like forever
I'm obsessed with it and the only thing
about these I have the like senti Puma
slides which are like pretty really
expensive for slides but now I know why
they're so much more expensive because
they're so comfortable so comfortable
like I could live another like nah I
think I might just need to like break
them in or something but these are
better like when I want to wear shoes
that I really care about because the
Fendi ones like have fur or like I don't
like a texture to them so they like pick
out dirt and stuff easier bethy's I can
just watch and we all good so then the
next thing I got is a pair of shorts and
I have literally like no shorts right
now quite a problem because it's been
really hot outside the Bay Area's
weather is the most bipolar thing you
will ever see so they just look like
this just like denim what I really
really like about them is the top like
I've never seen shorts in have a top
like this like they look like the bottom
and I just think when they're on it
looks so seamless and like really cute
and like I'm really into them so I got
these bad boys and then I got this shirt
you could probably tell that I was a
shirt and two videos ago but I'm
obsessed with this it looks so good with
like a nice tan will look so good in the
summer it's just an adidas crop top with
like black stripes on the sleeves and
little logo here and I don't know it's
you're cute and I'm into it so then I
got this jean jacket and the only thing
about this is I'm going to like really
have to learn how to style this thing
because it's like crop and frayed which
I love and it's like super bulky like
these pockets are really big so when you
put it on it kind of bulks up in the
front maybe is just a little too big
okay velcro nice to you so I believe
that's everything I got no it's not no
okay so I got this cropped gray jacket
it's so cute it's like zip up and then
it's like frayed on the bottom or like
cut I don't know and it's pretty small
so I wear this with high rise things
unless I just feel like showing my whole
stomach it's like pretty lightweight
which will be good for the summer I
really like this I really like this this
is such a typical male thing to do I'm
gonna show you one sock I can't find the
other one because I wore it the other
day I actually were to prom funny enough
I wore it with McCamish under my prom
dress of course which was like long but
when I like hoisted it up you would see
these and in my camo van so it was quite
a look and I got these soft some Urban
Outfitters
oh the reason I got these is because
there's a tiger on them and I'm a Leo
some like tiger leo like same family
right
I just thought they were cute they're
all blacks little tiger and they'd look
cute with vans and shorts I don't know
we'll see but I like them too never up
to me song hello what's up and then I
got these and they're just like come on
I know they smell fish net fishing and I
don't wanna use for show long could
never find them and it always be sold
out and I've seen these like all over
Instagram all over everyone I think they
look so cute with this and a pair of
like ripped jeans I don't know I just
think it's really cute
so got those and then I got this brought
lunch
that's from Calvin Klein it's just black
and says Calvin Klein on the band this
is so so comfortable so flattering to
like since its triangle I feel like it
just makes your boobs look better I'm
gonna be honest home but I don't run you
so much like bra laughter my life dude
it is I love them so really quickly I'm
going to show a shirt I got it from
grails which is like a website where
people like sell their old designer
stuff or their nude is know mostly it's
like it's mostly new this was new wasn't
used it's just this orange shirt and
legit this was the color of my hair like
two weeks ago I just wanted to point
that out before I got a fix I just want
to try the hello it's from off-white and
V alone and I love it and then there's
even writing on the sleeves which is one
of my favorite things ever so I'm in
love with this shirt I don't even know
if I'm going to put the price just
because I don't hate on it we'll see I'm
obsessed with this and so cute so that
I'm also really quickly going to do
these camo pants
I don't hover the website got the mat
I'll have everything linked down below
for you guys I don't know if I'll find
links for all of these but I'll try so
they're just these camo pants and
they're like cargo and they're like
really big and like baggy but they fit
my waist and then they're like high-rise
and I'm just obsessed with them like
this and like a white crop tank top and
some dope shoes it's just quite a cute
outfit I really I'm into it I got these
bad boys and I also got them in black
and white and purple and white but they
did fit so I'm happy these fit because
these were the ones I wanted the most so
then from a Danielle quiso I hope I'm
saying her name I could be so wrong and
skinny
wheezes but I got this two-piece and
I've been obsessed with two pieces
recently especially like sweat suits
what I really like about these is
they're first of all black and red two
of my favorite colors they're also very
well liked fitted like they're not like
over super baggy like sweatpants like
oversized necks what I meant to say so
they're like form-fitting which I really
like and they're really cute they just
like bunches and I got the matching top
of course because it came as a set and
it's so cute the black and red like
I got I just love this I can already see
myself writing you so much in the
springtime or like when it's a cold
summer night oh my god I also got the
same thing actually in black and white
and it's funny because this is the one I
wanted for the longest time but it's
always sold out and then I saw that one
go on sale the black one I was like oh
my god and then they were both in shock
I was like okay I have to get both so I
don't bow it so cute like the checker
speaking of two pieces a set I have
another set from the Kylie shop right
this is just the sweat pants that have
flames and when I saw the flames was
like okay these are mine because I love
flames this is a flame for like the
color flames I love it we got these are
really really comfortable like I wear
these to sleep all the time
I think they're boy sweat pants - so the
crotch goes really low and then the
pants are kind of like skinny like it's
hard to explain but I don't wear these
out as much as home doing nothing and
then I also have the matching cronic
with the flames this actually keeps like
some gold chokers whenever I know so
then from PacSun I picked up a couple
things the first thing is this shirt
it's all red and says adidas it's like
the weight I know this like that - Foley
teeth - fully but I don't know if I want
to keep this keep it how it is return it
or cut it into a crop top because I feel
like that'd be really cute I'm not kind
of torn let me know down below what you
guys think though like I liked it but I
just feel like something needs to be
done to it you know and then also from
PacSun I got this Calvin Klein zipper
and I'm kind of torn between whether
it's black or navy blue thanks black
we're gonna go with black and it says
Calvin Klein on the bottom like the
strip that's on like the bras and it's
so soft make it looks really cute I kind
of wish they had it in an extra small
because this is a small and it's like a
little big and I've just been really
into hoodies recently like zip of one
because it's better if it's like hot out
or you want to like wear it chokers like
showing off so then also from PacSun I
got these jeans and they're just like
all white bra white white huh I have a
delusional to debt light denim blue
pants there we go they're skinny jeans
have some distressing in them but then
the bottom which is my favorite is like
cut off you can see that right you'll
see it on me but they're not like to
crops but they're like a good craft and
I just like really like how they look
almost like a little bit more edgy
I don't know from forever21 I got a
couple things like literally two things
I got this
stop white hoodie once again another
hoodie but I actually really like this
one cuz it's like full it's not like
crop so if I just ever want to wear like
a full hoodie it's white which is like
cuckoo the summer makes you a tan it's
like pretty lightweight um I thought
this was a good purchase and like
knowing from time when it's are like 12
bucks which is awesome and then I got
this piece this is a size 2 extra-large
oh it's the plus nice - it's really -
extra large 2 X - work anyways it pretty
much fits me like longer than addressed
as if I were to wear this it would
probably be with like booties or boots
or something but honestly I just wear
this around my house I really like the
distressed part of it both that's what
like shoulding oh my god it's just like
grunge and then a couple of jewelry
things I picked up recently I've been
from our um I and the M jewelers and
jewelers yeah so the first chakra when
right now and then this one is from are
you my these are pretty expensive I like
have one of them for so long and I never
let myself get them until I realized
that all my other chokers were like
dusting and turning green and turning me
green like my neck and I was like it's
time to invest in some nice necklaces
because I were these like every day you
know that's worth it these are from the
end jewelers and they're customized like
personalized so this is melody in little
letters I'm obsessed with this up my
name if you didn't know this one which
is a uppercase like graphic M graphics
took the right font I feel like it's not
and I like to think it oh no I think
they're like so elegant and cute it
looks so cute stacking them I feel like
with the four of these I can make so
many different life styles and so many
different facts I don't vote I think
that's everything I got I hope you guys
