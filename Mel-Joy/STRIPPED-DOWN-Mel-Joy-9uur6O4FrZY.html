video is going to be an extremely real
video so I'm going to be filming the
stripped-down challenge if you can tell
I've no makeup on I just have eyelash
extensions if you're wondering I just
got out of the shower my hair is not did
I throw on a t-shirt um because the
stripped-down challenge is where you
pretty much sit down and talk to the
camera for ten minutes um and you can
have no edits you can have no music no
cut to know anything it's literally raw
footage so that's what I'm doing today
because I was recently at UM VidCon last
weekend and I've learned a lot about
YouTube over my time in YouTube and on
YouTube and things like that so I have a
lot to say and I don't know I think this
be a good video because I love keeping
my channel real so I'm going to start
the timer for 10 minutes um yeah and so
I started it for 10 minutes and I'm just
going to start talking so pretty much
the reason why I did this video will
first of all a lot of you guys in my
comments we're asking me to do it they
were like just sit down with no makeup
talk to us like be real as like all
right I got you and then I asked you
guys on Twitter and you guys did really
wanted to see it so yeah and um I'm like
really messing with my hair because it's
wet and but anyway so when I was at
VidCon um I got to meet so many of you
guys which was amazing so shout out to
any of you guys who came up to me
because were so sweet I absolutely love
meeting you guys it's like my favorite
thing um by the way the background this
is not my room this is a different room
in my house but I wanted to do it with
no CD studio lighting and then just the
natural lighting so that's what we're
doing um but okay let's see so hmm
we're leaving start I'm such a Rambler
and like such a ranter if that's a word
that this video could be going so many
different directions but we're just
going to start with I guess we're going
to talk about
how I really like my channel okay I'm
stopping messing with my head I really
like my channel to be real and like
that's just something that I really
admire in someone when they're really
real and they're not fake they're not
pretending to be someone else just for
the views or the subscribers or anything
or even just someone who's not a
youtuber you know anyone I really like
surrounding my people surround ours
surrounding myself with real people and
I think that's why I really like the
stripped-down challenge because it's
literally just you at talking and that's
something that I am totally okay with
putting on my channel because I want my
channel to be an outlet for me that I
can put anything on whenever I want and
I don't have to filter it because
because someone's going to think I'm
weird or that they're not going to like
that outfit or something like that I
want to be able to put what I want and
to be able to show Who I am as a person
creatively and you know like not get
judged for which I know is really hard
and everyone gets kind of judged for
everything in their life not everything
but you know what I'm saying so I know
that's not realistic that I'm never
going to be judged or anything but um
like I'm okay putting this video out
there because I am me and that's okay
and I want you guys to know that it's
okay to be you and like that's why I
really like this challenge you know and
I don't know I think as people grow
bigger on YouTube they think like oh I
have to keep up this persona I got to
look really cool like whatever I don't
even know like what goes on in their
minds but and I'm not trying to hit on
anyone I'm not like I'm not pointing any
when are pointing anyone out or anything
this is just like a little rant ramble I
don't know like I personally look up to
so many youtubers and so many just
regular people um so I'm not dishing on
anyone I'm not trying to do anything
like that but I think YouTube is an
environment where people like put
themselves out there and I think once
people get like good feedback on that
they're like oh like people are really
into me you know and then maybe their
ego kicks in and it starts going the
wrong way
and they forget where they came from
that is my number one thing okay not
never one thing but it's really
important to me to never forget where
you came from like you guys got me here
you know like I could not be doing what
I do without you guys in my life like
you guys are so important to me and like
make me so happy and I don't know it's
that's really important to me that
people should just not forget where they
came from because like I don't even
though this is already such a rant and
ramble but I'm gonna position myself
like um um I think when I was at VidCon
I got to see a lot of creators and a lot
of supporters as well and um I think
when I don't know
well VidCon is really different this
year because of the whole security
because you know it was needed with
everything going on but I thought I
think that there was a lot less like
creator and supporters like intertwining
and more involvement there but I mean it
had to be done just because of the whole
the whole thing that's been going on
which is really sad and just terrible um
but yeah and I don't know I don't know I
think I've learned a lot on YouTube I've
learned so much so much and it's also
helped me to grow up honestly as a
person I feel completely different than
I felt a year ago or two years ago when
I started my youtube um because I kind
of know what's important for me in life
now and I know what I want to focus on
and what I don't want to surround myself
with and what I do want to start myself
with and I think that that sometimes
this is such a rant but like I love
YouTube I love love love YouTube but I
think sometimes it can put people in
like put people going in a the wrong it
just puts them in a position where they
feel they feel like there's so much
maybe higher up than everyone else
and I don't know I don't know that's
definitely not everyone at all but I
think egos
kicking sometimes and people start
trying to pretend to be somewhere else
because they want to be up there they
want to be higher on that whole level
and I don't know I really I really want
you guys to know that I want to keep my
channel so raw and like me and I'm never
going to put out a video to you guys
that I don't feel comfortable with and
think that it that I don't seem like
myself in it or that it doesn't it
doesn't resemble something that I want
to like show to you guys and help you
guys with like I want everything to be
like me you know because I'm okay with
being me I'm I think that that's the
number one thing everyone should just be
themselves in life because that's what's
going to get you to where you are and
where you're supposed to be that is just
going in it's just going to do it for
you and I think that I think that as I'm
growing more on YouTube which thank you
guys for like four hundred thirty
thousand that's crazy
oh my goodness I can't like that's
unreal but um I think that I want you
guys to know that I'm not planning on
changing whatsoever and if I do change
it's just because I grow up and I
experience new things and I learn new
things and I whatever but I'm never
going to change who I am as a whole
because that is the reason that I'm here
right now does that make out of it and
um and I've learned a lot of valuable
lessons from YouTube and I'm excited to
grow my YouTube and maybe share you guys
more of those valuable lessons because I
really do think that it's helped me a
lot in life and getting me to be a lot
happier I'm going to be honest a couple
years ago I was not a very happy person
mostly in the end of middle school I
just struggled with a lot of like
anxiety and like not fun stuff and I can
say that I've pretty much overcome that
and I'm just so much happier where I am
now because of so many things that I've
done to change my life and you guys you
guys are like the main part of Bali I
can't be more thankful for you guys and
this is kind of just like a big thankful
video and also just telling you guys
like where I want my channel
go and it's I mean already said this but
it's going to stay my channel it's not
going to turn into anyone else's channel
I'm going to keep doing what I want to
do I'm going to keep reducing the stuff
that I feel comfortable with and that I
want to share with you guys and things
like that um I don't want you guys to
know if you're struggling in any way
shape or form I'm always on my Twitter
on my Instagram tumblr anything reach
out to me and I will talk to you guys
like I think that's a lot of time when
people grow bigger they kind of stop
communicating or like communication
between the supporters and the creator
tends to die down a little bit but can I
just say when I hung out with
rclbeauty101 Rachel at VidCon she's like
so wholesome and down to earth like it's
insane and like she's eight point three
million subscribers and that right there
I was like yes like yes like straight up
that is like I don't know like I look up
to her for that so much and she still
continues to favorite you guys tweets
respond to guys treats and I think
that's awesome and I think that like
everyone should give that much attention
to their supporters because like you
guys got ever all these youtubers I
don't know I don't know I'm rambling how
much time do I have left
um I have a minute left I've been
talking for nine minutes but hmm what
else do I say um I think that okay well
I'm gonna start focusing on my channel a
lot more because that is something that
I found that is one of the most
important things to me in life you know
and um so I want you guys to know that
I'm going to work really hard on my
videos and I'm gonna think a lot about
what I want to create and what I want to
show you guys because it's kind of crazy
how much in one video can have impact on
someone because it's the whole number
thing is obviously weird to me because
if I see like oh I have this many views
or this many subscribers just like okay
that's a number and then when I was
meeting you guys I've been on a personal
like these are real people that are
watching me like what like that's crazy
and like I don't know it's like it makes
you really have
sometimes you just like put a smile on
my face but um I don't know I really I'm
happy I did this video because this is
me like hey I'm Mel what's up my real
name is melody if you didn't know but um
like this is the one to present me the
timer this is not my ringtone okay Wow
hair cool um so yeah that was the
stripped-down challenge tag I didn't get
super emotional or anything just because
um you guys make really happy and I want
you guys to know that and this is going
to be my channel it's gonna stay my
channel so if you don't like me then you
probably should just hit that little red
button but I like you so what's up um so
yeah thank you guys so much for watching
