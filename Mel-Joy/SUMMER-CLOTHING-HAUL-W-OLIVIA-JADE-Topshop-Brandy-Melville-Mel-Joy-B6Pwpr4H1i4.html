you just tell me we're gonna do this
like so legit Lee right now just didn't
what every little rambunctious
rambunctious bunk that's - shut up - ty
Tyler hey guys it's me Mel and today's
video I have a very special guest with
me I don't know good Olivia is then what
are you doing with your life to be
honest we're doin it this is Olivia Jade
Olivia I will be half of a living Olivia
Jade here on YouTube click the link
below because we've filmed another video
on her channel a part 2 of a haul like
we have half things on her channel of
things I might really know if you know
so go check out her channel click that
little subscribe button you know what
I'm talking about do it
so anyway way of course we are going to
be doing a summer clothing haul mostly
even though sweatshirts we're going to
show you how to surf we got a Topshop
and then have to stuff we got a brandy
melville and if you want to see the
other hats on your channel where should
we start with I think Topshop Yeah right
I'm yawning three times I'm gonna keep
like a little thing I love you got a 3 I
don't know if I've talked about this on
my channel I think I have but I've been
wanting this bomber jacket for like ages
and I know it's almost summer but still
I'm gonna wear next year I'm honestly
probably no word in the summer as well
but it's this green bomber Jackie oh she
obsessed with it and it's pretty just
the generic ones that like okay that's
like a lot of things a lot of people
have and if you guys are new to my
channel then you don't know that I say
my sizes and my prices you can do it if
you want it if you don't want to totally
don't have to but I do because you guys
think that helps me I mean that helps
you guys know nothing else me I got it
for candy not note it I got it in the
petite because I noticed she's that it
fit better but I got in like a size 6 in
petite so it's still a little bit
oversized it fit better than the two
were like this small in the normal and I
still wanted it like a little oversized
not like super oversized because I feel
like that just like I don't know a bomb
was like that and
one hundred dollars so it is you know
pricey it's a nice jacket it is a good
really good jacket and I don't have a
lot of like jackets like this so I
invested in it and I'm happy with it but
I'm always right sighs yes I think this
is and if you're not then I'll just give
this home the first thing I got from
Topshop is what I'm wearing it's this
army green sweatshirt and then right
here what does it say Norman it says
United States Air Force and then it has
a cute little patches right and it's
right there actually show Olivia this
jacket she did so critics cried two
mouths about you and then on the back it
says United States Air Force as well
just very cute
I don't know the pricings I'm wearing
and I ripped the child but I got in a
size large so it's super oversized if
you guys saw Olivia's video then you
know that she inspired me to wear more
oversized sweatshirts because I love
hearing myself okay the next thing I'm
going to talk shopping is jeans that I
got and I'm obsessed with them I've been
one jeans like this for so long no the
Jaime jeans are pretty popular young v
fit really well to scale and they're
like really high rise which I love and I
got a size 24 waist billing fish is 32
so that's how long that is all this
oppression
you don't like eighty dollars but
they're really good quality jeans yeah I
really like these and I've been wanting
jeans like this for so long
and I finally got them so I'm excited
about it yeah so the next thing I got
from Topshop is this long sleeve but in
a striped shirt kind of and it's just
like the copper dries like go different
weight yeah it's there interesting cuz
it goes like this way and that way I
don't know if you can really see it but
over a bathing suit you could just throw
this over and make it really cute in
summary so we said this on Olivia's
channel but - Olivia we have like pretty
similar like the aisles but like hers I
can lean to a little bit more like
preppy like you have some preppy things
yeah and then I'm like kind of less
preppy I guess but I find it really like
interesting shopping with you without
like similar styles and then like a
little less similar cuz you seem like
branch out yeah like try anything yes
yeah okay just two more things sorry I
shopped a lot
yeah we've been neck no problem Rock
shop oh yeah I don't think we said that
even in this video Olivia's like closet
went missing my closet went missing
basically not like my dresses because
they still a few but it's my shirts and
my shorts are just basic summer things
just gone hey Mel take it listen to me
okay next I got this plane like greyish
blue t-shirt it's just a t-shirt I love
it at its basic tee you need it why not
tied up with things like something
lastly from Topshop I got these moto and
so James I got a waist 25 in 30 and they
were $75 look at me I'm Mel and I will
stress latest strikes on them and
they're really interesting the cuff they
are really good they're high-waisted and
they fit nicely I own again 6 6 oh yeah
board I swear I'm just tired like guys I
just really bored her she's a doctor so
next we went to brandy Melville and I
picked up a couple things so the first
thing I got is kind of branch out of my
comfort zone I'm gonna be honest but I'm
trying to like experiment more style
thanks to this one are they gonna see it
it's so not experimental really
everything you know sweetie I don't why
I guess why I got comments oh they're
white sweeping what they're white sweat
pants but they're super soft because
they're bringing logos so to the
lighting and they're just like cuff but
I feel like these guys over here are we
at seven now with seven literally I
believe the term of shop till you drop
we don't drop though we were close to it
and gonna drop seven yawns later and yes
they're just like so fans with buckets
and I think that these can be really
cute like a colored crop top and some CS
or something I just feel like these
could be easy lounge pants but also be
crisp out yeah because that's really
white I don't know but I'm excited like
the fit is very yeah one kind of like
jogger totally that's the word totally
the price of these were $30 and it's one
size because brandy melville this is
very similar to my Topshop kind of
situation
Oh Randy I picked up these kind of
beachy pants I've got a lot of this kind
of like linen material because it's like
some already super nice for the beach
like throwing this over a bathing suit
with a nice baby
but the bathing suit top is super
comfortable and cute and stylish it's
like this pattern just looks really good
on you like I think I couldn't eat and
the price of this $38 and then the size
is one-size-fits-all okay that's true I
don't believe this can one size actually
finished a just rude of traveling public
baby and then the last thing I've got a
brandy melville was this pretty basic
top but I feel like it's a staple to
have it's just like a white kind of
bleach crop top but then it has some
buttons right here which i think is
really cute it would look cute like a
bralette or playing or anything let's
just weaved ribbed
there we go yeah it's a ribbed and it's
$15 oh and shout out to the girl at
brandy melville who came up and said hi
to me and I thought of you
memens please do so cute from brandy I
just got this another plain t-shirt I
like it guys watch my video I got a
plane one minute just for you I got my
way dinner and this is another one this
is just a black as a pocket I like that
okay yeah we're looking for it to like
that I thought point we're just so done
with shopping we're like yeah we're like
this is quiet luscious no home is for
the whole we're so hungry so hungry you
don't even know we like devoured our
salads is so good we're so healthy this
