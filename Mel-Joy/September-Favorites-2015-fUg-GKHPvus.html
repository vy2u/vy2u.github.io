be a September favorites video so a
monthly faves I have never done this
video before I've never done a monthly
favorites so I thought you know why not
give it a go if you guys like these
videos and want me to do more favorite
videos for the other months you can let
me know down below I read all your
comments how much if you guys don't know
what a favorites video is I'll be
sharing with you guys my favorites that
I've been using for the month of
September so we're gonna start apps
because I'm on my phone quite a bit so
if you guys want a or some an iPhone let
me know and I will definitely do that so
the first app is Paul snupps it's that
orange up right there and pretty much
what snupps is is a fashion and beauty
lifestyle app it's not just fashion
beauty's like for artists so it's kind
of anything that you're interested in I
use it for fashion and beauty
inspiration so pretty much what the app
is it like allows you to share your
collections that you have created and
it's kind of in a way like an organizer
you know okay so what you do outside you
guys so this is what the homepage is
what it looks like this is just your
feed and like who you follow and if you
can upload a photo right there with the
orange button and then you can snap like
any you can snap any beauty favorite
fashion favorite anything like that and
I personally like using shelves this is
my profile I have a fashion shoes and
beauty shelves pretty much what this
allows me to do is I can put my favorite
things that I've been using and like
that I like for example that was a
lipstick and these are some shoes and it
just allows me to show you guys what
I've been liking and also allows me to
remember what I've been liking so I can
just look back at this and see like if I
want the same color and a lipstick that
I really been liking I can like put it
on here and then keep track of it and
then I can always look and remember
which one it was and this also gives you
a lot of inspiration like when I looked
through my feed I'll see people putting
like lipsticks I'm like ooh I'm gonna
try that or an outfit or a shirt or
anything like that and I think that's
really helpful for beauty and fashion
inspiration like that somewhere
outfit I don't know I really like the
app personally if you guys want to
follow me on it it's me myself and melt
with two L's looks like this and you can
just see what my favorites have been so
that has definitely been one of my
favorites I just kind of go on this
whenever I'm looking for inspiration or
like people's favorites or what they
like also it's really cool I follow
something drawing towns even though I
don't really draw that much and it's
cool seeing those because I wish I could
draw the second app that I have been
really liking in Spotify
if you guys have seen my other videos
you know how obsessed with music I am so
I have Spotify Premium not trying to
brag that's just what I have I like
Spotify Premium because it is ten
dollars a month but you can add any song
you want any number of songs I have like
over a thousand songs I think in total
with all my playlists and I don't even
want to know how much that would add up
to be in iTunes
129 per song and I use this all the time
if you guys want to follow my Spotify
it's me myself in mouth two L's the same
account as snaps a lot of you already
follow me on that but you can just see
what I'm listening to my songs I've been
liking stuff like that I think those
were my two favorite apps this month so
let's go in to beauty favorites
so my first Beauty favorite has been my
lorac Pro palette I have been wearing
this every single day I'm wearing it
right now this is the second one and you
can tell I've been liking it because I
have to pan on several colors I use this
palette every single day I'm not I just
really like it and they're like really
neutral colors but they have a variety
of mattes and shimmery colors I
definitely suggest it if you guys are
looking for a new natural palette or
something like that the next thing is a
mascara and it looks gross I'm just so
sorry about that but it is the oops it's
the Lancome Hypnose drama Lancome I'll
show you what the brush looks like I got
this for my 16th birthday forgot to put
it in the videos okay so it's pretty um
new it looks like that and it's just
like a curved brush but I'm not just
having really liking this it's one of
the best mascaras that I've personally
tried I've been using this for a pretty
long time definitely the whole month of
September because I had a mini bottle
then I ran out
I got this my birthday and I don't I'm
just obsessed with it so then the next
Beauty favorite is this Nivea lip butter
if you guys saw out what's in my
backpack you guys saw this I have been
applying this to my lips like probably
five times a day at school a little goes
a long way so this is going to last me
forever I can already tell and I just
like love the feeling of having like you
know soft moisturize lips like you feel
you know I don't wanna have like dry
crusty lips so this really helps it is
in vanilla and macadamia kiss it smells
super good it tastes really good
I know it's just I've been using this a
lot my next favorite sorta perfume
concentrate is this Ralph Lauren
midnight romance perfume I got this for
my birthday this clear bottle with black
writing oh no I think it's mostly good
and I've been using it everyday barely
and he's gone and I'm not just this
helps me smell good throughout the day I
guess it's pretty girly but it's also
not like super girly refused but it's
like not too overwhelming which I
personally like so I've been liking that
and then my last Beauty favorite is my
tweezer man tweezers they're like purple
they would like this I got these a while
ago but I have never got my eyebrows
done nor do I want to I know so many
more stories of people messing up their
eyebrows and I just don't I just decided
that I can control my aggression with my
tweezers and have it the way I want it I
don't know maybe one day I will but
right now I also just don't like waiting
to grow them out but I like these a lot
these are more on the pricey side but
honestly I'm so happy I invested in
these I've found them for so long but
I've just been using them a lot more to
do my brows and that's pretty much it
for the beauty favorites so then the
next thing I'll do fashion favorites the
first thing are my Nike running shoes
these are the lunar tempo shoes I showed
these in my back to school haul these
are so comfortable I wear these whenever
I work out I never I go to basketball
conditioning anything and I think really
cute too they're just black and on the
side they say lunar all lunar on but
they're those lunar tempos as you can
just for running I think they're really
comfortable and I think they're cute you
know I have never had like black running
shoes but I really like having black
running shoes and then the next fashion
favorite is not really like a a thing
but a color if you guys know me I love
the color maroon and I thought I have
talked about it pretty much I just have
some clothing that's marooned to show
you guys that I've been wearing a heavy
maroon banjo I have this marine tank top
I have these Marine shorts my nails
right now in maroon my necklace so
that's not really like one article of
clothing or anything but it's just the
color I just really like to Cameron I
think it's gonna be so big and fall I
just think it's a good color personally
if you guys like the color room like
this video comment down below another
fashion favorite are these bra let's so
this is a bralette from Urban Outfitters
I have a white one and a black one I
also have Brawl it's from like Windsor
victorious leave your other things like
that but I think violets are so cute
just to kind of like dress up your
attire Dass really comfortable too so
yeah I just been loving these I've been
wearing this a lot that's pretty much
all the fashion favorites and then some
random favorites we got some food the
first rain of fear that I have is this
cheese it snack mix if you guys I've
never tried this you are missing out one
of my all-time favorite snacks it has
these things in it these Oh bread things
these are like wheat crackers cereal
things pretzel sticks the cheese it a
little like rice ball and another
pretzel but different shape um I really
like these and the double cheese one
these are so good yeah I've been eating
a lot of these doesn't like my third box
in a month oops
and then the next random favorite is my
Camelback purple water bottle with this
little purple
what is this carabiner on it this I just
keep in my backpack and I have been
actually bringing water to school almost
every day in September and I you should
never bring water to school I realized
that it's a good idea keeps me hydrated
I would suggest bringing water to school
so that's why this isn't a favorite I've
been using it a lot so yeah that was my
September favorites those have just for
the things that I've been loving for the
month of September maybe I'll have some
new things for November if you guys want
