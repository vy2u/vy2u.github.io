to surrender
I could go on
and here between them
so hey guys usually the first thing I do
is get home from whatever activity I was
doing that day today I just had my
second driver's lesson and that's why I
had my permit in my hand and I also am a
counselor at a summer camp so I got home
pretty late because I had a busy day but
when I got home I just went up to my
room and plugged in my phone and then I
opened my laptop and I went onto YouTube
tumblr Netflix my team I checked my
emails pretty much anything that I just
needed to do to catch up and then when I
hear my mom or dad call me down for
dinner I go down so that's what I'm
doing I'm going down to dinner and
tonight we had lasagna and it was really
good and my mom was really good chef so
that was great um and then I just went
back upstairs
after I finished dinner and I'm
signaling that it was good because I
touched my tummy anyway so then I just
walked into my room and I was like huh
what should I do and I was like oh I
should workout because usually I have
basketball but I didn't today if you're
wondering I play for my high school it
was my free day so I thought that I
should get a workout so wearing pretty
much all Nike is you can tell and what a
champion headband and then I have my
Roshi's and I'm just showing you with
them on my feet and after this I applied
some chapstick because I don't know why
but I tend to like my lips a lot when I
exercise so then I just grabbed my phone
and my earbud so I could listen to music
and then I drank some water and I went
up side and I'm going on a short run it
was kind of late so I had to get moving
fast so I just opened Spotify Premium
and if you guys want to follow me on
this it's me myself in mail you guys
totally can and so you can listen so you
can hear what I'm listening to so I just
turned that on and then I go on my run
and so I got back pretty late and I
sprint at like the last little bit of my
run that's why I came back really fast
ignore that but I ran about two miles
but I had to stop because it was pretty
dark out but I'm just showing you I
stopped about halfway through my run and
I just look at the pretty sunset and
look at this view guys so I just did
that and it was really pretty so that I
came home
I came upstairs I drank some water
because you gotta stay hydrated after
running and exercising and usually so
now since I did my run I work on my abs
my arms and my legs because I like to
you know tone them a little bit more so
I'm doing my workout routine if you guys
want a full workout routine let me know
down below or like this video and I will
definitely do that for you guys because
it changes quite often so I have a
pretty solid set one right now that I do
almost every day not quite every day
though oh and I also can't forget to
dance just because when I have music
blasting in my ears I have to dance it's
just it's just what happens so I'm doing
that and I am I don't know what happened
here but I did a little back roll okay
so I did that so I went to my bathroom
and I took off my makeup because my
makeup was pretty much already gone from
running from sweating but so I just used
my Neutrogena makeup remover wipes and I
wiped my face till it was clean of
makeup and look how much stuff's on it
that's gross okay anyway so after that I
had a clean face and I just took my hair
out
I turned on my shower I'm just taking a
shower and yeah if you guys want like a
shower routine or something let me know
because I didn't really tell you what I
use but here I'm wiping off the camera
here I'm just wearing my dad's big
t-shirt and my bralette so I used this
rapid clear stubborn acne from
Neutrogena face wash while I was in the
shower and I just applied that normally
on my face and now I'm just coming
through my hair to get any tangles out
or anything like that because I'm going
to brush it later and yeah so I grab my
toothbrush and I grab my toothpaste
because usually they go two together and
I just brush my teeth but I forgot to
wet my toothbrush it was gross so I did
that and now I am just brushing my teeth
normally so now I'm taking my GLAAD Pro
health floss and I'm flossing my teeth
you got to make sure to floss your too
so you don't get cavities so I'm just
doing that pretty much pretty much
after I'm done by lossing my teeth I
just drink some water and then wash my
mouth out so now I'm taking this acne
cream that I was prescribed by my doctor
and I'm just applying this on my face
and my acne has gotten a lot better from
this so I'm thankful for what this does
and I just do this every night before I
go to bed after I wash my face because
you're supposed to like have some wait
time before you apply it after you wash
your face so now I just put on my braces
at my necklace and I went back to my
room got to turn off that light to save
electricity and I took some lotion this
is my Vaseline aloe lotion and I just
applied this on my legs and then a
little bit on my arms or my stomach or
just wherever else I was feeling dry
so I did that and then after I like to
put my hair up in this little half updo
so I don't get my hair my face is my
acne cream on because it's like sticky
so just put my hair up to remove that
and I'm wearing shorts if you're
wondering and then I did some laundry
while I watched some Vampire Diaries
because I needed to do that and during
this time I'll usually like clean my
room or do my laundry just get the stuff
that I need to do done while I you know
watch me up I recent or TV shows or
anything so after I'm done with that I
applied some Carmex and usually do this
right after I wash my face but some
Carmack's and then my EOS lip-balm
because I like to have my lips feel like
nice and moisturize when I go to sleep
and then I just lie on my laptop for a
long time I watch Netflix I do YouTube
stuff edit videos I go on tumblr
Instagram whatever I check my emails and
I after I do that for like a couple
hours or a pretty long time I just get
in bed I put in my earbuds and I always
pretty much listen to music right before
I go to sleep I don't let myself fall
asleep listening music but I just listen
to music then put my phone away and here
I'm just going an Instagram YouTube all
my social media before I go to sleep and
now I'm going to sleep so thank you so
