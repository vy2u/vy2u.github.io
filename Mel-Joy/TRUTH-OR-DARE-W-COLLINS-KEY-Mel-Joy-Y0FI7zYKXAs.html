Mel's most liked video alright you want
my feeling let's do it alright alright
first one I dare you to do a backflip so
I'm no what do ya know I can't do that I
couldn't do a backflip previously so
we'll see if I can still go and we'll
give this a shot let's let's do it here
we go
that's good there we go okay my Terriers
sheltered I don't know how you just did
that to be honest so the next question
is a truth it's what is the weirdest
thing you have had an emotional
attachment to okay so for me
least when I was like I think eight or
nine I got this candy apple from like a
fair and I was in love with this thing I
don't know why there was like a cool
design on it a ton of different toppings
I was just so into this thing I would
not eat it I like refused to eat in my
purse like Milione eating candy apples
like no like I love this thing and I
honey in my fridge for probably about a
month and I never I never got to eat it
because I was just obsessing over it and
the night's third away but I guess I had
an emotional attachment to a candy apple
yeah that's a pretty strong emotional
husband yeah enough for me um probably
this key there's like a distaff Amelie
heirloom and stuff it's been on my
family for my love are like 100 100
years so my family for a long time so
when I wear like every day like all the
time so this is pretty strong emotional
attachment to ever leave the kid I dare
you to call the fourth person in your
contacts and tell them that your channel
has been deleted so all that you do with
Lauren my fourth contact is one of my
friends from school but they they know
about my youtube they're definitely
involved so I'm excited to see the
reaction hey Anthony yeah I'm freaking

information we have so far i think like
we you guys ones who did it no are you

hate her dream is intelligent so this
sort of that um I got my balloon right
there Wow what ok yeah so that's cool
hashtag no edits no cuts okay this one
is I dare you to do the whole video with
your clothes on backwards so how about
this we'll compromise and we'll do the
next question with our clothes on
backyard so let's go change I guess so
we're gonna do a truth now and the truth
is do you have a crush on someone
oh this one's a little personal yeah
exactly before we go on a morning let
you guys know I went all the way I'm
doing the most yes I know change his
pants backwards I don't think I see this
coming like huh don't call them okay see
it's looking back pockets here okay it
feels very weird how my skinny jeans so
I thought that maybe it wouldn't work
out but really he's made it you went all
the way all the way I look he's been
doing that just like avoid having
answers question
I have a crush on anyone yeah not a car
something one I thought you might some
irritation just like okay cons I see you
I see you of me not really no I'm gonna
be honest but maybe later we'll see I'm
actually a little bit uncomfortable in
like the backwardness like this part of
the show it's really fly should we
change protect papi I'll go to change
that moves again that could be
uncomfortable the next dare is that we
