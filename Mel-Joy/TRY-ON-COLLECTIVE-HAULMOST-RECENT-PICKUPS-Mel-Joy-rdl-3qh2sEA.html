today's video is going to be a haul and
super excited all is used to be one of
my favorite videos to film and one of
your favorite videos to watch or from
the feedback I got sort of looked like I
have not done a haul in months I was
looking through my own videos to try to
find my most recent haul and I was
flabbergasted no I was just I was
shocked because I love shopping I love
fashion it's my favorite thing and I
haven't updated you guys on what I've
been wearing and what I've been buying
and that's not cool mal come on I didn't
turn my fan off today Frank I'm sorry if
there was noise the first little bit of
this video my fan was on and if you're
new to my channel what is up it is great
to meet you you already know I would
appreciate it if you would subscribe and
I have faith I just always want to dance
like what's my promo I have faith you
know where the button is and also if
you're new to my channel and haven't
seen one of my hauls I say the prices
and the sizing to help you guys out I
keep it real I like to do that I don't
do it for any other reason than try and
help you guys if you like to say sizes
me or if you like the stuff and you want
to buy it but you want to know how much
it is so yeah if you want to leave a
hate comment about that you can click
off or ignore the text that says the
size I get the phrases here so today's
video is going to be a little different
than my usual hauls because this is a
collective haul like literally over the
course of months I'm talking about like
my month before my intro is five minutes
long I'm like usual let's get started
okay I'm gonna start with shoes because
if you didn't know I have a shoe problem
it's not the worst I know a lot of
people who have a lot more pairs of
shoes than me but for me its sneakers
like your girl could never have enough
sneakers I'm such like a casual outfit
where I feel like did that make sense so
I think I got these vans the longest
time ago but I never showed you guys I
don't think I showed you guys in a haul
I'm like 99% sure you saw on my
Instagram photo I paired these with
cable pants and I thought it looks so
cute so pretty much these vans are like
this lightish orangie yellow like
sunflower color and this is like my
favorite color
in a shoe
I love this color this color just makes
me so happy I feel like it just shows
like happiness yellow yellow means happy
I feel like I don't know I just I love
this color my favorite oh yes
moving on to the next show is giving me
throw back vibes because I used to play
basketball if you guys didn't know and
these just remind me of like shoes I
would wear when it it's just remind me
of shoes everywhere will I play
basketball and I miss it I need a ball
up who wants the ball up with me with me
I got these pretty recently as you can
tell haven't been worn a lot but it's
like this reddish orange e color on line
they looked like vibrant orange like
this color like the orange part of it so
I was super into I was like yes 4-inch
come on give to me I love orange and
then I got them in the mail and they
looked more red and I was kind of like
ant at first and then I tried them on
and paired them with stuff and I
actually really love these they're sick
I don't know I love shoes like this I
want more like this because it's just
such a little part of me from like
basketball and just I love the way they
look these are the Air Jordan retro ones
and your girls the fan I'm very much so
into them and then the next pair of
shoes I got are again looking like vans
but psych they're not these are the
revenge storm sneakers by Ian Connor I
have been wanting these things for so
long I love them they're coming I want
to get yellow color which I really
wanted it but pretty much on the back
they say off the instead of off the wall
like I think for Vance it's just kind of
funny because they look so much like a
van but they have a lightning bolt on
the side which you know I'm already
gonna love because I love lightning
bolts self promo if you want to buy my
lightning bolt choker link down below
and they're just red red is one my
favorite colors you know I had to get
these maybe really had my size left when
I checked for like six usually a five
and a half and guys but I gotta say
because they didn't have half sizes so
they're a little big these would look
cute with a Nike high socks I'd be with
that thank you and like oh I'm just
having all these ideas I'm so weird and
then the next pair of shoes are by far
one of the most beautiful pairs of shoes
that you will ever see today can we can
we take a moment go it's a Kobo I'm
obsessed I just there's no other word
for obsession I know I used
too much along with cue no word except
for obsessed because look at that I
actually customize these on the band's
website so I made it like checker and
then the black of course and I did mess
up a little bit I'll tell you guys my
mess up because I'm a person I make
mistakes I got the tongue checkered
which I didn't know if I want to check
it or not the regular shoes like that
have the checker don't have them I don't
think I've got them anyways I don't know
you can't really see them anyways what
the lace is just a detail I thought I
would share the thing that makes the
shoe for me is this yellow stripe it's
I'm gonna be wearing so much I can
already tell these shoes are just me in
a shoe really quickly I'm also gonna
show some Sony's because I don't think
I've showed these before on my channel I
showed them like an Instagram photos and
stuff I don't think I've told you where
they're from how much they are etc so
the first pair of glasses I got these a
while ago I have been obsessed with
coloured glasses like all one color and
just any type of cool fun color like
these even on your head like this makes
an outfit I actually bored the stuff in
the other days these are from PacSun
these just give me such cute bags of
this and then the next pair of
sunglasses that I got are from I'm Coco
la I accidentally ordered two of them
I'll show you a picture for my private
yes I thought everyone but I got two
maybe I paid for it maybe I didn't I I
always place orders of the same stuff
like twice don't know why I just got a
lot going up in here okay these are just
a vibe like that's the only way I have
to describe them they're groovy they're
groovy talked about four shoes in two
sunglasses and I've been filming for 20
minutes so now we'll be onto the clothes
I only ordered from a couple places okay
so the first place of course you guys
know me it's my favorite store I went to
Urban Outfitters and I picked up some
stuff I have been wearing all this stuff
you're so often I feel like there's such
staples and I'm just I was happy with my
purchase I'll tell you that so the first
thing I got are these shorts and they're
from Juicy Couture I believe they're
just like multicolored shorts I guess
like color-block almost and I'm
with them this is just like a white
cropped up or anything it's very lazy
and cute and like no I really like them
sweat shorts might be my new thing
is that acceptable I also got these
pants these are so sick to me
they're this navy blue color with this
mustard like goldish color and white and
navy blue down the side and they're like
button pants so pretty much I knew from
Fila and they're the most comfortable
pants guys if you feel the inside
they're like oh these are my new
favorite pants like cute pants that like
make you look put together but they're
also super comfortable and like still
sweats like yes so then I got these two
shirts smack and wearing these like
crazy there's pretty much nothing like
you can't wear this with it's just this
black little like tube top and then also
this white one I got two colors I wish
they had more you can dress them up
dress them down whatever I'm into it
okay I don't think I've showed this I
don't think I've showed this in a hall
like a bando it is a bando it's a bando
but there's like this little elastic for
the top so it's like a little strap
little mini strap this is just super
cute like dainty it's very small but
this was like high-rise leggings is like
my favorite just basic black outfit I
love it and I'm sorry for the other in
stains I wear deodorant I'm a person
let's move on we're gonna have fun - I
am Coco la it's like this la online shop
they have the cutest stuff I've been
buying from them for a while and I will
continue to do so it's like vintage it
was like one-of-a-kind or most of their
pieces are so the first thing I got from
there is this t-shirt but it's like a
very oversized t-shirt actually - long
sleeve I was wrong it's a dress on me
like it almost goes to my knees so I
feel like activewear this was like jean
shorts and it'd be cute you know so
people don't think
my pants it has these flames on the
sleeves and then has like an Eightball
which i think is cool this is from
Harley Davidson I am obsessed with early
Davidson I'm wearing a shirt from them
right now I don't know they just saw the
cutest stuff it just looks so flaming
cool and like Eagles and it's just they
have a great design whoever's at the
head of their bring the front looks like
this has a little tie up with the flames
the back just says Colorado the back
justice collar on holding the back just
says Colorado Springs Harley Davidson
yeah I don't know I'm really into it
very cute gonna wear this a lot in the
winter and fall I already can tell it's
really quickly I'll talk about the shirt
that I'm wearing this is also from I'm
Coco la has little flames on the sleeves
this is a size of medium I believe so
fits a little bigger so it's like
oversized but I think it's cute still
they have like just the cutest little
details like if you look here they're
just like ripped and a little triangle
like that's just cute to me I don't know
you'll see it when it's on me
but I really like it and I think it's
very cute and this shirt is also from
Harley Davidson as well very oversized
it's like a t-shirt dress on me but I
think it's super cute this was like of
course this was vans would be so cute
but what I really love about this is how
distressed it is there's like all these
cutouts and rips and whatever and I
think it just adds a lot and it's super
cute the back is plain but the front of
course has a sick Eagle once again with
Harley Davidson and their cool designs
I'm a fan and also really quickly I just
got these socks from I'm Coco Lee but
they're like fishnet yeah stocking so
yeah we're fishnet stockings but I have
like long fishnets but I think this
would be really cute just for like you
know this bands we'll see but I'm
excited about these just little fishnet
so then moving on to pants these are
very much so like the Fila ones from
Urban Outfitters but there are different
material and they're also all black so
they look like this the crotch is a
little big for me so I might like cinch
them a little higher on my waist just
because the waist is like a little just
a little big like it could be a little
smaller also the look of these is just
very chill and like whatever so I
I just keep them the way they are you
can hear the material on a mic now if
this is so then I also got these camel
pants from there as well I'm obsessed
with these they cuff at the bottom I
also wore these on my Instagram and yeah
they're also kind of like looser but I
feel like it's just a style these
pockets are actually so useful I didn't
even realize like how cargo pants like
for guys could be just so useful like my
dad wears them all the time and now I
understand why because you just have a
lot more storage and then I pretty much
got the exact same thing but in a skirt
form it looks like this folks it's just
a little camel miniskirt with pockets on
the back this I think does have to be
cinched in the waist a little bit or it
will just like fall to the bottom of my
hips which doesn't like the cutest not
the most flattering and every wanting a
camel skirt for so long just so much so
then really quickly I got this bodysuit
from forever 21 I thought I would
include this I've got a lot more body
suits from there too but they're packed
in storage right now I still have to
take them out of storage it has like the
straight line which I really like with
the straps this is one of my favorite
body suits I wear this so often so yeah
I got this from from - no one was super
affordable out a hundred cent recommend
checking out the body suits and stuff
like that they have some great basics so
the last place I'm gonna show you guys
stuff from is the Kylie shop and I only
got two things from here Jessica she
came out with some cool two pieces were
inevitable for me to get because I love
camo and I literally live in sweat pants
this is could not just be a better fit
for me so I really like these super
comfortable super soft but I also got
the top as well I honestly don't even
know the way this goes like I feel like
you could wear it either way so in the
Tryon if I'm wearing it wrong that's my
bad I really can't tell sometimes but I
also got the little camo like sports bra
crop top very small crop top type of
shirts I end up wearing these pieces
like separately a lot which is cool but
also together they look cute so yeah so
yeah so that was everything I believe
that I'm gonna show for this haul if you
guys liked it make sure to give it a big
thumbs up and comment down below any
other video
you would like to see it from me I would
really appreciate it if you would leave
some video suggestions down below

keeps getting shorter each time the
week's go by because she keeps doing the
video ideas she has so yeah you would
really help me out if you let me know
what you would want to see so I can do
that for you guys so I love you guys to
infinity and beyond I mean it when I say
it and I hope you know that and I hope
that you're having a marvelous morning
afternoon or night and I will hopefully
see you in my next video I really feel
like a line today like my inner leo is
just it's a literally look like a lion
with this hair oh I just get caught up
thinking and people's bull just are
laughing I was so over all the trouble
I'm in such a weird mood today this is
weird I'm crying why am i crying why am
i crying people literally only text me
when I film how ironic by the time I'm
done filming I just can't say words
anymore it's just not a thing for me
okay I'm so over drama good oh my god I
found a tic tac so then I got this dress
I feel like I've shown this in something
I'm not showing you dueces be be up
pretty much in this video I show you
guys three looks I was about to do way
more than three I show you three looks

way so if you want to wear less make it
