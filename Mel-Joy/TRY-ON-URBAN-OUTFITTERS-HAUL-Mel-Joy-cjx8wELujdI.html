filming this at 2:00 in the morning my
sleep schedule has been show off after
going to bed at like 4:00 in the morning
every night and it's just it's bad so
here I am at 2:00 a.m. do you ever feel
tired and then once you try to go to bed
like it just can't mood also ignore this
nail having a puppy and having acrylics
doesn't mix I'll just I'll just say that
Travis is with me my little puppy right
now actually he's not a little anymore
he's huge he's only like three four
months yeah it's looking good no kiddin
oh my god he's so big yeah I wanted to
film at 2:00 a.m. so he would be asleep
so it wouldn't be an issue because like
literally filming with him is so hard
because he's just sitting here like on
my lap biting me all the time but yeah
that didn't work out obviously if you
hear noises in the background that might
be it um I'm gonna be honest I'm so
excited for this video because Urban
Outfitters has been one of my favorite
brands since I don't even remember and I
luckily got the chance to work with them
on a video so today's video is brought
to you by aircraft it is which is so
dope for me to say so thank you so much
to Urban Outfitters for sponsoring this
you guys were a pleasure to work with
and I have nothing bad to say about your
brand
I don't you could all of the products in
this video are from Urban Outfitters and
all the links to the products will be it
down below if you want to check any of
them out I think we should get started
on the home because it's time your girl
should sleep but she don't want him in
all of my halls I always put the size
and the price it might be the other way
around
no no but I always included the price in
the size because I think it's helpful
and when I watch cause I personally
would like to know the size and the
price so this has a stain on it this
needs to be washed but I pulled it out
of the laundry pile to show you guys
it's just like this mustard yellow looks
like vibrate but it's from champion it
just has the little sign here and then
on the sleeve and then the back looks
like this which i think is super dope
I'm a fan you can never own enough
hoodies so then I got this super cool
jacket from Kappa it's just a white
jacket with like this light teal blue
detailing on it I
you look so sick I don't know it's a
vibe it's a vibe there's just something
about track jackets like this that I
just I love and then I got this jacket
from the ragged priest white on the
inside it has like this is exactly what
I was avoiding or trying to avoid don't
work out so well why aren't you tired
javis gets fed up with his toys so quick
and goes to anything human related yeah
like a plate
it just has white stripes on the sleeves
with like some red detailing and blue
and yellow I think it looks really cool
zipped up or just open so yeah so then I
got these pants from adidas and they're
just red and have the white three
stripes down the side and then on the
very bottom it says ain't no sunshine
when I'm gone and then just have some
flowers on it oh my god wait if these
were forget-me-nots that'd be really
cute if I can find any way to not wear
tight pants like leggings or jeans I
will do so so then I got these orange
pants from Puma they're from the Rihanna
Fenty line they just have like yellow
and black stripes down the side and
buttons to just rip your pants off if
you're in the mood very like different
color choices I feel like but I really
like them so then I got these blue pants
from Dickies and I think these are
really cool they're like carpenter pants
or something I could be wrong I'm
probably wrong they're my favorite color
blue I don't know I think they're sick
they're a little big on me so I wear
these like oversized like a crop top so
then I got these overalls which was
definitely branching out of my comfort
zone but I'm gonna be honest after I saw
the PAQ boys wearing them I was like
okay they look sick I don't know these
are like really oversized white ones I
think I could make them a look but
they're also from Dickies I like
a red label on the white I think that
looks really cool there's a cool
detailing but yeah like I'm excited to
experiment with these um so then I got
two shirts relating to cars because I
problem
I love cards so the first shirt just
looks like this
it just says white orange and pink cars
on it and then the other shirt has a
blue car on it and I don't know I think
these are really cool I just wanted like
more t-shirts that I could just like
throw on under jackets and stuff so then
I got these pants which I feel like are
kind of similar to with the Dickies
pants or like this dark mustard khaki
color but they're shorter and then go
more wide at the ends you guys know me
I'm not the biggest copy dresser I guess
I don't love that style on me but I did
buy to prep your looking pieces they're
just C's like black trousers with a red
stripe on both sides and then they cuff
at the ankles they like the buttons and
they're like the material of like the
nicer dress pants but I don't know
they're cute and they're black and red -
my favorite colors and then I got this
crop top and it's like it's like a
sweater I can open it like that I prefer
to have it open it's just black with
white stripes in certain places I'm
excited to play around with this and all
the pieces what am I saying
so yeah I think that's everything that
I'm going to show in this video I still
have a lot of hauls coming soon so yeah
I think that's gonna be everything I'm
gonna show in this video I got a lot of
pieces there's literally still more but
