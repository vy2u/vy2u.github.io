okay I kind of had mac and cheese just
because it's like cheese yeah it's in
the title business we hope you guys

nice bread crumbs on top it's nice very
focused oh look at that look look I

just my pennies per second is really
around this is like should we braid it
oh yeah yes mmm read this nine out of 10
this on given ten point five mm I've had
these before she has okay I'm really
excited about this though I thought they
were monastic I was so wrong I was
feeling one like people snapchat stories
and I guess they're not there what are
they buffalo buffalo wings but it
doesn't look like we wait so we have
this on - right yeah it's all pretty
hoping it's almost as hot as me don't
get oh my god oh my god
that's pointing it Mary I'm not gonna
fight I'm in today I forgot if I show
them yeah it's the last thing I'm really
sad for because I like nachos I love
Mexican food you guys know what is that
this is my study goes like this it was
so good they do obviously this is also
Mel Joyce background Lee yeah I just uh
all my background by the way oh my god
have you tried to shake it for the
reason you have oh we didn't raise the
buckle of sticks singer I rate the
buffalo sticks like nine nine you like
that I didn't like them I like the spice
but like I liked it first one small
question yeah they taste really good
they are look like this I mean honestly
they taste like Buffalo like yeah well
wings would be right I was into in front
like I feel like an eight for me
I'm incident me too
now what do we describe this pork and
just dug in what if I just our way is
great even tell them really hungry we're
going to keep eating so it makes me so
happy like the consistency is my chicken
which is different because I thought it
would like have a consistency of tofu
but it doesn't it may well succeed in
this after the video video could tell us
everything from Reggie girl we're gonna
have to talk about yeah I think yeah
let's go for so Mel and I were so happy
because they're just Twitter called like
2017 goals though these things like like
for example like retweets if you want to
be running your yes basically we were
goal for the collab and I would senators
like this so go for each other oh my god
we even send this on my channel and I
gotta say dat me and Jesse goes way back
when we both have like less subs you
know you comment our channels can be
like something forever like so I got me
came home like I like your videos
whatever and we did that we did that to
each other and this is working like each
other's videos we were like we will
ladies on YouTube and I think that's so
funny oh you're done you might say I see
little bars we never turn it off you
know ya know so bars
I got a choker on like guys look how
good you'd even like whoa weird
background like I'm something to it
stranger things
oh my god editing know you better
include this not a clue Matt cinnamon to
it oh no no I saw them
oh no I did it oh I'm gonna cry because
she also said Miss winch the first thing
in the seven layer burrito her burrito
treats her relatable burrito treats make
my life I told him that I first met
other people serves a simple
introduction I'm like I wonder what he
doesn't know how it does Rita is it so
paying your sweatshirt with the burrito
on it I legit I'm gonna buy it you like
it yes thank you get it pink and it's me
oh my god is my sexuality but the thing
about like talk about it doesn't like
come vegan yet to make it vegan so you
substitute any of the needs for being
because I'm not a vegan they're
surprisingly doctor no cheese no sour
cream guacamole vegan everything like
that
just so sweet oh no I'm giving a totally
zero star yeah get a girl the next thing
is a Crunchwrap supreme so it looks like
this i think there's block let it be
just like talking shell
and tomatoes system your young gal okay
honestly it's really good I think it
would be a little better if you either
buy when you get it because it have to
have the crunch of the taco shell
presence we waited website dated oh my
god
so see this what's on the crunch of like
taco shell oh listen I mean we ordered
it a while up close making them reheated
it because we filmed her videos my wife
and I'm the crunch was so good this I
think maybe like a it was the 9.5 are
like it really I guess like everything
yeah I think it's probably an eight for
me or seven-and-a-half just because it
doesn't have the crunch and I'm all for
that try but probably like a ninety four
million subscribers would you dismiss
today oh my gosh you are last night I
love tonight look like why we're going
mad cuz I agree but you will it will see
my giveaway women oh you know put your
waiter on enter metal chair make a
venture so just turn nothing for a
little bit was getting dark for this I
think the guy might have messed up our
order to but this would be like a
protein bowl but they put sour cream on
it just in a little corner going off to
eat that part right this is a minimal
fee okay
so just ignore the sour cream we didn't
mean for this to happen a healthier
option for a fast food all wait is so
blurry like rice beans it's like a
protein fold it's totally okay ready
ready uh-huh
and how'd you put your colon this is
definitely healthier version for country
I wall salad you really actually I like
a lot of salads maybe you know I believe
people make salad and I don't want to
make it their way and like I just kind
of learned you know I would teach you I
mean so so often I like to microwave
potatoes I was all weird you like thank
you love again we have one thing from
talk about lab this is the Mexican pizza
we might have maybe dropped it looks
like too like taco shells with beans in
the middle and then pizza sauce and
tomatoes you know this is like the
hipster piso is unconventional diaper
like Wayne look and I think if you were
to like it maybe guacamole
boy I think if you were to add some
stuff on it yeah it'd be nice for any
dude I'm weirdly into this yes every
store - like the pizza box actually
tastes really good with anything what
would you give it I'm gonna give it a
champion to the nine point eight seven
six five seven zero eight seven six five
this is a 3.14159 has a new six on
another I would give this probably like
an eight all right why did you give the
bowl we're really bad it's already
Episode seven yeah me too committees
mystics digitated like lettuce and one
can write exactly really bummed about
this burrito because I love burritos
so we're pretty much for the last thing
it's from Burger King wait we
achievement who the worst thing are
described and I mean a lot of these
because price living eating healthy
rebuilds we move your mouth a lot we
really need yeah we just need all this
honestly loud hi Israeli begin which is
like insane yeah that's so nice but it
has all the ingredients on it Wow good
job Burger King and we want let's open

funds and you're really good at fun and
now my Cantonese I look them up in my
free time which honestly to happen so
the French fries I rate 10 out of 10
because I love fried and then we keep
them and then for the pie
