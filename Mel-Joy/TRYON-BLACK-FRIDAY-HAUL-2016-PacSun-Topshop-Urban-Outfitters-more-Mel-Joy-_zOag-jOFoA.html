blanket and jacket form like that is
something I needed in my life
hello my beautiful best friend today's
video is going to be yet another haul
you're probably wondering Mel wasn't
your two videos ago
second to last video you catch my drift
was in one of my last videos a haul yes
yes it was but this haul is Black Friday
edition so like where's that hold up I
don't know what this weird shadow is I'm
sorry if it's bothering you I think it
looks kind of cool if you're new to my
channel hello my name is Mel is great to
meet you I would love it if you would
subscribe it would make my heart very
happy I have faith you know what the
button is also if you're new to my
channel I stay at my sizes and my prices
and every single one of my Hall is I've
been doing it since I started on YouTube
I find it really helpful that's why I
like doing it and a lot of you guys give
me great feedback about it because if
you're similar to my size or you want to
see if it's worth buying at the price or
whatever they'll be down here in the
price and the size so yeah I say that in
every single one of my hauls I bet you
guys know by now but yeah just wanna
clear that up I told myself I was not
gonna go Black Friday shopping just for
my wallet sake you know um and that
didn't that didn't happen
till the first place I'm gonna show what
I got from English was PacSun because
one I think packs I'd had the best deals
overall and - that was the first story
went to at 6 a.m. we like we're waiting
outside it opened my friend was the
first one pack said she felt very
accomplished I'm gonna start with the
hoodie because um I live in hoodies and
I have way too many so like why not buy
more right what I was excited about this
is this is like a pretty decently
expensive hoodie and I was like oh my
god so the sales in packs ton were I
would get one free denim which I was
super happy about because I need I need
denim I need jeans the second one was
buy one get one 50% off like the entire
store which was also really good deal so
I was really happy that so the first
thing I got was this hoodie from the
Justin Bieber purpose tour it says
all-access on the on the front it's red
it says world tour on the sides and then
on the back it says purposed tour I have
been looking for a red hoodie for like a
really long time like a cool graphic one
like this with like something on the
sleeves and I'm back in the front I was
into it when I saw I do like Justin
Bieber not at the point where like I
would go see a mentor and I'm like a big
fan girl of him but like he has some
good music so I was like you know what I
liked it I would get it I got this in a
medium because that was the only size
left cuz it was like selling out because
his March isn't like available
everywhere I don't know this was pretty
expensive for a hoodie so it was a great
time to get it for buy one get one half
off the second thing I'll show is also
just purpose tour you know I might as
well I know it's like the same design
but it's a different color and it's a
different style so look the khaki shirt
which I love this color so much and it
says the same thing I'll access world
tour and then purpose tour on the back
super cute I had to get it in a medium
because that was the only side left it
kind of fits me as like an oversized
t-shirt slash dress I know I cut myself
off from t-shirt dresses in my last
video but this is long-sleeve so it's
different okay okay I could wear with
leggings I could look like an oversized
shirt or I could wear it with shorts and
it would look like a dress you feel me
so yeah I'm very happy about that then
this next thing I just obsessed with it
I'm gonna be honest I was about to get
the light pink color I already have a
light pink bomber jacket so it's like
I'm gonna try to find something that
like I don't have something similar to
the color in a jacket or whatever so I
just got this white fluffy jacket and
I'm someone who was always cold I'm just
always cold my goal was to get like warm
jackets on Black Friday and I got a lot
of them so I'm very pleased with myself
or I got I got a good amount and good
amount I don't know I love it it's lip
bob which I've been loving recently cuz
I don't have as many zip up as I do
sweatshirts inches I'm not fluffy and
I'm obsessed it's so soft so comfortable
like why would you not so then the next
thing I got at Paxton was a flannel this
is the men's half of my clothes are from
the men's section like the two purpose
shirts were I don't I don't know mine
says cute clothes I'm gonna be honest
I'm jealous of men
maroon ish flannel yeah it's like maroon
was like white and like green black but
I got it in a small and it's still
oversized like it's fits me like it's a
pretty big jacket I would wear with
something like maybe like this I don't
know like a white tank top and jeans or
around your waist you can wear flannels
in so many ways and it's another thing
to make you warm you can layer it under
a jean jacket whatever then the next
thing I got from packs out
also from the men's section is this
denim jacket but it's like distressed
and that's what I really really like
about it because I'm looking for light
that I'm distressed jackets like a very
long time but I wanted to get it in like
oversize like very oversized so if I
wore it with like a dress it would kind
of like almost go to the length of the
dress not quite like you know very
oversized and I said that's so many done
so I got it in a medium to have it very
oversized and I think it pretty much
does the job like how big it is chunky
it's just it's a good time then for the
buy one get one half off denim I saw so
many pairs of jeans that I liked like a
lot so I tried them all on I like only
like one of them and I was like really
now like it's a buy one get one free and
you only like one pair I end up getting
a second pair that I didn't even try on
I was like Matthew Nathan you can always
return them but I got home I tried them
on and I liked them so like that was
good but this is the first pair and
they're just like this light wash denim
dove but they're like more jegging kind
of type and they just have rips all down
the front like I've been looking for
more light wash jeans you know I look
really distressed ones but I want like
more calmer looking jeans the second
pair I got are these mom jeans yeah
surprisingly the mom jeans fit smaller
on me so I'd get like a size up but I
usually get keep that in mind I don't
know if it's just the fitting of it so I
got these just like denim mom jeans I
have like darker denim on mom jeans but
I don't just have like light plain denim
mom jeans so really have about these
I've been obsessed with like mom and
boyfriend jeans gonna be honest it's
like half of my Jean collection and then
the last thing I got up accent I like
don't have anything like this like I got
two body suits on this trip but I don't
have any body suit other than that so
like you know what I'm gonna try it out
but I got this nude color I was debating
whether to get the new one or like this
is a little bit black but my friend was
like I think you should get down so you
know I listen my friend it's just this
nude body suit it's kind of revealing
maybe it's because I got in an extra
small
you get in as well I don't know but it's
very low-cut I feel you can make it not
revealing if you like Dora are you
really grow it or something like a
lightly line bra put okay I'm dead nude
and then ribbed
now look what really cute like tucked in
the mom jeans like something I don't
know so that was everything I got at
PacSun I believe so then moving on to
let's do hmm I'm gonna do Nordstrom they
were not having me best sale I don't
have a talk shop in my area but they had
so much more of talk shop like
collection there I love talk shop I was
so happy I was like yes yes like thank
you I did some damage at chop shop it
wasn't all on sale but like tops up is
just so the first thing I'll show that
is on sale I know it's probably on sale
because it's like a summer type thing
whatever it's still cute ribbed scoop
neck tank top and I don't have anything
like this and this is like the most
basic thing I know my last show I showed
a v-neck one and I was like I love
anything like it
so like technically I do have something
like it with a v-neck not a scoop neck
totally different situation like I'm
really excited to this like under the
jean jacket or whatever it will
definitely be layering this in the
winter because it's cold and I could not
go outside no no also my last haul I got
like a lot of summer type big because
are like seventy eighty degrees
literally the week after of all this
stuff it's 45 degrees 4050 I don't know
that's like really warm for some of you
guys but California weather just
fluctuates oh and sale was 20% off so
this was like really cheap already plus
Ryerson off so it was a good deal you
know I mean this one was also China
percent off already on sale and it's
like a read raved bodysuit and this is
also kind of revealing or pre room but I
feel like there's ways you could make it
not revealing I don't know I don't
really have anything like red and this
bright it'll be good for Christmastime
so then I got two more mom jeans
yes we're talking two more pairs the
first parent and these are not on sale
which is like in like I love talk shop
jeans like I'm obsessed this is the
first pair I love so I have like really
ripped mom jeans but not this ripped
like not where you can see my whole knee
and like that's what I've been looking
for for so long I really need to chill
with my hand moving just like a light
kind of denim and also with these like
in Topshop jeans I usually really get 24
but in these I wore my five so I don't
know the mom jeans just fit me
differently or fit everyone differently
let me know down below and the second
pair is just this black pair of mom
jeans that are also distressed not as
just oh wait now they are pretty
distressing I just got this black pair
and I really like that so then also in
North Jones I got these hoops and I've
been looking for bold hoops for like the
longest time because I have some silver
hoops but I like to wear like gold
jewelry as you can tell like all my
jewelry is gold but so I got these gold
hoops too much my jewellery and I'm
really happy about it and they're like
pretty good size so yeah then it's UMI's
I got this shirt I already know I'm
gonna comment saying I don't skate every
dress this is so many videos but yes I
wear Thrasher and I'm penny board or I
have I have a penny board area to
skateboard when I was younger but now
like I Drive because like what's gonna
get you there faster driving or
skateboarding so I got this shirt I have
a black brush a shirt with this like
fire logo on it but I have it in a men's
small so it's like kind of big so I
decided to try to get a youth to see if
if any men are not a medium and it fits
me like a regular shirt kind of so I
like that this is just like ripped jeans
or whatever just very casual casual
attire I'll do when I got it Urban
Outfitters this was not on sale but I'm
still gonna include it because I got it
in the mail the other day okay the first
thing we're gonna talk about is the best
thing to ever exist my family just likes
to keep my house at like 60 degrees
which is kind of cold for me so I'm just
like cold a lot of the time which is
like not fun so I got this it's pretty
much a blanket but in a jacket so I like
I've already been wearing this today and
it's reversible it is reversible you
already know it's gonna be a good
purchase if it's reversible so it
reverses to white and black oh my god
don't worry it's not real fur it's like
fake shirt buff or something but like
can we take a moment kind of like
Cruella de Vil vibes
did I say that right I'm obsessed it is
so shocked this is I'm kidding you on
got the whole winter it was kind of
expensive but the amount I'm gonna wear
this thing like it'll be so worth the
money i blankets in my house that are
like this but it's literally your jacket
blanket so then this next thing I got it
Urban Outfitters did I need them no you
know
want them yes there are these velvet
jogger pants and I do not own anything
like this like come on how cool is this
gave me such like 70 vibes don't even
know even my mom when she said I was
like oh my god that is literally 70s cut
out at the bottom like this like kind of
blah blah nimesh I'm even though but
they like track pants they have like
striped sounds or whatever but they're
velvet it's look look how cool that
looks like come on come on and they're
so soft and I wasn't gonna get these cuz
they were like originally like $69 but
then literally like 20 minutes after I
added them in my part they went on sale
and I was like girl it was a side it was
a sari I don't know I'll probably them
around my house maybe this was like a
white tank top out and about and just be
like yeah you're my Belva track pants so
the last thing I got it Urban Outfitters
wear these aviator glasses can you see
them also my mom was like so 70s like so
70s these aren't like the exact shape
that I like wanted is their clothes a
little bit more square but like it's
good it's cute you
these have been like really in recently
and I just want to go out and just look
like I wear glasses and look studious I
love them I don't know I think they can
add a lot to not fit I have to find more
vocabulary to like describe words of
incubation mmm and it's this jacket and
don't worry this is fake fur this fur is
removable which I like it a lot more
with the fur removed it's not bad with
the fur on it I just like the look of it
a lot better on the person I know it's
like a black bomber jacket which I don't
have any like good black bomber jackets
I know I really like the silver
detailing on it with like little circles
zippers I don't know so this is
definitely a staple and it's really
really warm so that's what I really like
about it it's got my hair thank you guys
