Netflix by myself it's a little it's a
little overdressed there was a crazy
sale recently in urban up what am I
gonna fly away hello my beautiful best
friend today's video is going to be a
part two dose of my haul if you haven't
seen the first part you should probably
watch that like tell promo whatever like
it it's honestly probably gonna make a
lot more sense so I would go do that if
how are you I'll leave the link down
below I'm gonna look different in this
clip than I do throughout the rest of
the video because I pretty much ended up
filming like a hour long haul
so I split it into two parts but I had
to make an intro for this one so hey I
look different but what is up if you're
new to my channel hello my name is mal
it is great to meet you thank you so
much for watching I would really
appreciate it if you would subscribe I
have faith you know the button is let's
get started on to the haul I hope you
enjoy to try on haul yeah if you do let
me know so let's do this I actually
ended up giving a couple more things
that I wanted to include so the first
place I'm going to talk about really
quickly is subdued calm my friends over
there sent me some stuff for the new
season and I'm obsessed first thing is
this denim jacket and I got in a size
medium also I see my sizes and prices of
everything I put them right here because
you guys have always given me really
good feedback on it um and if you don't
like that you don't have to watch but I
just do that because a lot of people
tell me stuff well I see that every
single to my hauls but yeah so I just
got this big oversized denim jacket I
got it in a medium so it would be
oversized but I have this jacket and the
light denim color but this is the dark
denim and I'm obsessed and if you don't
know what to dude is they just came out
with their first store in LA in Santa
Monica so if you live in Santa Monica
you should go to 416 Broadway because
that's we can get these clothes other
than that you can go to subdued calm
they have like a ton of stores in Europe
and everything but they're like moving
in the US the girls are so sweet so cute
the second thing is this zip up Hoodie
this is just the comfiest thing ever
this isn't a navy blue color I also got
in like a heather gray color it's so
crazy soft
I'm obsessed at simple hoodie and I live
in hoodies so the next thing I got is
this pink shirt it's like a nude color
and it has lace right here like lace
Jimmy and I think it's so cute I also
got this in black which you can see when
I try it on but
I mean it's the same thing in black it's
just like silky and I don't know it's so
shocked I feel like this looks so cute
like a bomber a jean jacket whatever a
very dainty and feminine so yeah
then really quickly I'm going to talk
about white fox because they also send
me some stuff stuff is so cute I'm
obsessed and I have a coupon code for
you guys it's Mel 15 but you can get 15%
off your entire purchase and they have
the cutest clothes like I'm obsessed I'm
really quickly going to show this little
fancier type of thing so this is a crop
top oh lord how do I show this but it's
strapless I'm holding it sideways just
stick with me that has like a choker
attached you feel me you you get it you
know you'll see it when it's on me so
there's this but they also get me this
black skirt that I'm gonna probably wear
it with so it's like a two-piece like
how cute I showed like a leather one in
my last job but this one's more like
really stretchy and soft which I
actually really like but how cute would
that look like
come on got this it's like what is it
mini skirt pencil script like short yeah
no that is what I got from white fox no
more of me looking like this move on to
the hall my style has kind of changed
over time so I just cleaned out my
closet and I got rid of so many clothes
I donated a ton of them so I was like
I'm gonna revamp my closet so I kind of
have a whole new wardrobe let's get
start so then from a black dope I'm
wearing a shirt from there right now but
I just picked up a couple things from
there to this shirt which is just like a
black distressed graphic tlf outs
distress I just realized that I was
wearing it wrong the whole video nice
Gemma what am i doing without I was
wearing it so wrong anyway got this
cropped gray hoodie that has some
cutouts on the shoulder I think this is
like such a kind of basic type of thing
but the cutouts on the sleeves kind of
add a lot that's a little embroidered BD
on it and then so many of you guys we're
asking where this hoodie was from
because I posted a picture on my
Instagram it's just as black hoodie but
then in red on the sleeves it says black
dope on both sleeves and then on the
hood as well it has the embroidered
Biddy here in red and I think the
writing on the sleeve is so cool and
like it's in script which I love and I
love red and black together so yeah so
then from forever 21
the first thing being this camo jacket a
lot of you guys were asking where this
is from I don't know I
this I wore this with like leggings and
just a white tank top in my hi-tops and
it looks so cute very versatile I feel
like perfect for fault I love love love
camo you guys know that so then the next
thing I picked up is this graphic teeth
no if you're wondering I don't listen to
kiss but it's cute okay sue me what I
really like about it is the bleached
part of it you know I just got it in a
large toured as a t-shirt dress cuz
that's been like my new favorite thing
that's like literally all I've been
wearing recently like it's kind of bad
to them the next shirt I actually wore
yesterday it's wrinkled I'm sorry but
it's the shirt that I also wear as a
t-shirt dress it's from forever 21 men
so I got it in a smaller size then like
I would have gone in a women's and it's
this shirt that says look but don't
touch
and like don't take me serious I was
like I just really liked it for the fact
that like there was like a little
graphic image and then had like red and
then like white writing the last thing
from forever 21
wobb wobb watch why is this lace up
shirt and these happen show in and when
I saw this it was pretty cheap and I was
like you know what that's try it but I
got it in a bigger size so it would be
like a dress on me kind of in-between a
dress and a shirt so I gotta have to
wear like shorts just in case because
you know more flashing one but it's just
kept on the sleeves which I don't know
if I love this time it's good wait can
you unrolled it no no I can't this was
like a jean jacket I feel I could be
like you I got like a lot of t-shirt
dresses we're going to fall I don't I
tend to like not buy something because
like a season's coming up i buy just
because i really like it and i'm like
what if it's not there next season so
I'm just like whatever melted then from
PacSun I picked up all more t-shirt
dresses so the first one is this Misfits
one but this is like huge I tried on
large and was way too big she was like
oh I'll just get the medium I know will
fit because I got a different one I was
a medium and the guys t-shirts I liked
only shopping guide apartments to be
honest so I'm thinking of maybe like
distressing this and maybe cutting a
little shorter and the sleeves because
it's like really big or turn it don't
know yet but I did get this this I've
been wearing and I I love it just this
Guns and Roses blue tie-dye t-shirt
dress I love this with like knee-high
black boots or just high tops so
versatile so cute and yeah
I recently discovered that I really
really really liked Urban Outfitters so
the first thing I got it over half it is
and like this is like three different
trips there was a crazy sale there's
online recently so I like hopped on that
like ASAP
and I just like checked out before I
could like see anything else I was like
no Finch limiting yourself I got like so
many good deals first I'm gonna share
the stuff that wasn't on sale and then
I'll show you the stuff that was on sale
the first thing I got is my BAE on a
t-shirt it's Drake but but Degrassi
weight Degrassi me and my sister is that
right my sister and I my sister and I
watched Degrassi since I was like three
feet tall I'm not even joking like
whenever she'd be watching and my
parents like wouldn't want me to watch
it cuz like they did some bad stuff but
and I was pretty young but I would like
sneak into the room and watch it with my
sister no I just saw this and I was like
oh my god like my childhood in t-shirt
but of course I got in a bigger size
because t-shirt dresses am I right yeah
I just realized how many t-shirt dresses
I got like I'm stats like for the rest
of my life like please cut me off I'm
not even joking tweet me right now no
more t-shirt dresses for me then the
next thing I got I also put all my
Instagram and you guys loved it so thank
you it's this gray hoodie but has flames
like right here on the sleeves and I
think this looks so cool but I got it in
like a really big size cuz I have so
many normal-sized studies were like no
oversized cities where I could let Y
them as a dress so I was like you know
what I'm gonna buy this and I'm gonna
wear this dress than the next hoodie
from Urban Outfitters I also got tons of
questions on but it's this like pink
hoodie from champion guy section so I
got it in a small I was thinking of
getting it in a bigger size so I could
wear it more as a dress but this is like
a cool size where I could wear it with
like with shorts and it kinda look like
a dress or I could wear with leggings
and like fold it over and like it would
look like an almost I study so I was
like you know I'm just gonna keep the
size I'm happy with it's deciding
between this one and the tan one I think
this won't better with my skin tone I
don't know so many people have these but
they're so cute I understand why
everyone has them so yeah I got this bad
boy so then as you can tell I just
received to order in the mail literally
an hour ago from Urban Outfitters from
the crazy sale that I so impulsively
ordered stuff like literally a Spanish
30 minutes added all the stuff to my car
removed some stuff because like
limitations checked out we're good no I
got it the first thing is this t-shirt
dress it says well route on it I've been
loving these like warm colors
but it's really big I got it in a large
probably shouldn't have gotten it in a
large with urban outfitter t-shirts like
it literally depends a t-shirt on what
size you should get cuz I'll get like a
small one a medium in one and a large
and one and they'll all fit me I don't
know it's really confusing I don't know
I'm gonna do with this if I'm gonna
return it it was so cheap though or
maybe like if I cut it up or something
we'll see but I really like the color
I've been loving this collar recently
and it's cute like it's there holding a
little rose I did get that towards a
t-shirt dress once again and then the
next thing is also a yellow t-shirt from
the women's section like oh my god Mel
bought something from the woman's
section I got it in a size large because
I wanted to wear it as like a t-shirt
just of course like I did not realize
how many cases Jess's I brought like
sometimes I need to just stop and
reflect on everything I bought and like
then decide if I actually need more
something because obviously I don't I
had an idea for this because the sleeves
go kind of lower like I don't love it
so it's gonna like cut it and they cut
it at the bottom so I was like not
distressed but it was like cut so it was
like a hard edge
soft edge I really don't know like you
get the gist it's really soft I love the
color reminds means like sunshine once
again with the bright colors like Mel
it's fall what are you doing I got this
bralette because I wear bra lights on
the daily anybody to the committee I say
this in every Hall but to really meet
like this if you're part of the itty
bitty titty committee we can have like
meetings and just talk about how we
don't have to wear bras but yeah I just
got this because something to throw on
under a sweatshirt or something and it
was so cheap like five bucks cheap it's
super soft oh but it has like copper
detailing on it it's cute and I got this
almost bralette well it's a top it's
like really small like Mel you're
literally buying stuff for summer
what are you doing pretty much this like
kind of halter ish the neckline looks
like this I don't know I really like
this and all the stuff is so cheap and I
was like hey if I really don't like it I
can just return it in the store it was
so cheap I couldn't like I couldn't not
then the next black crop top I got
that's probably why I was all on sale
because it's summer stuff and like it's
not summer anymore but in California
it's kind of always summer crop top but
it tides up as you can see I'm obsessed
with this I got into small because they
didn't have extra small so it goes a
little lower but like it actually fits
pretty well which I was
but I like it so then I got this really
basic white red crop job I don't have
anything like this and I have been
searching for something like this for so
long and it's like the most basic thing
that you could possibly have but I have
it now it makes me really happy so it's
just like v-neck crop top yeah I don't
know if I'm crazy about this this one
might be going back just because of the
fitting like it's really tight at the
top and like kind of loose at the bottom
but I just thought that this would be
like cute or with high-waisted jeans but
it's just like this light pink crop top
honestly got these cropped off so I feel
like we're under bombers in jean jackets
so I could still be warm in the fall but
like layering Ameri it's like light
blush color which I also love that's
like my girly color like a light blush
color like I don't wear a ton of colors
but when I do like and then from ego
official I ordered to boot no no I heard
it one pair of eights and they are these
oh my goodness I'm in love like invite
to our wedding there's a name like perp
X perspex I really don't know clear
see-through he'll you see it and then
the boot is just like the shiny material
I was deciding between the light pink
and the grey like knowing me I would
probably were the grey more but I might
be ending up getting the light pink to
because I'm obsessive both and I love
the way these look so cute I thought I'd
show these um for me go official I don't
know if they fit me really right and
they might be a little big but I really
don't really own heels like this so I
can be so wrong but these were on sale
and we're literally like 15 bucks and I
was like okay why not I'd like no
stiletto black heels like this and if I
ever go to like a fancy outing occasion
in my life
I'll have them I can also just wear them
at home with Netflix by myself it's a
little it's a little overdressed but
they're just like these black heels
pointed toes which I've been loving it
has just like these long times that you
like can wrap around your ankles or do
whatever with you know you get me too
then these last pair of boots that I got
so many questions on are these boots
that look like this they're just these
not healed so I can wear them two more
things which I really like they're just
black you know like knee-high boots over
the knee whatever they tie in the back
they had like rounder ones but I liked
this look better so yeah I've been
wearing these with all of my million
t-shirt dresses I just bought and these
are from DSW if I can find them on the
website I will definitely link
down below but there's so many places
that you can find boobs like this but
that's where I got these and make sure
to give it a thumbs up if you liked
watching me realize how much I buy and I
don't know watching myself go through
all these irons I'm going to cut myself
off for a while that's probably a lie
we'll see so I hope you guys enjoyed
that video if you did make sure to give
it a thumbs up and comment down below
how you're doing honestly and what other
videos you'd like to see from me I love
you guys to infinity and beyond I mean
it when I say it and I hope you know
that and I hope you're having a
marvelous morning afternoon or night and
I will see you in my next video
