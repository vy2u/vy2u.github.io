so sad if this video I'm just so amped
oh my god
hello my beautiful best friend so
today's video is going to be a Q&amp;amp;A as
you can tell by the hoodie because I was
in all my Q&amp;amp;A but this Q&amp;amp;A is a little
different because it's all about like a
life update / what have I been doing /
whatever because if you can tell I've
been a little absent on some of my
social medias where I was post as much
as I usually weren't or as much as I did
so I just want to come on here to
explain why I've been extra busy because
I have been working on so much stuff I'm
so excited to announce it and this is
pretty much the announcement videos so I
am so pumped
so ant for this video and pretty much I
just asked you guys on Twitter like
usual if you want to follow my Twitter
you can it's Mel Joe pretty simple but I
just asked you guys to tweet me some
questions about like a life update
whatever you know I made sure you guys
do the topic and also I'm not feeling my
hair today I don't really know when your
style this is but we're going to work
with it and we're just going to hope for
the best so I took some screenshots of
the ones that I felt like I should
answer and there's a good amount of them
so we should just get started so this
video isn't 30 minutes long okay so the
first one I'm going to answer is from
sage I recognize you girl I love you so
sage asks are you excited to turn 18
soon I love you so much and I love you
more and girl I have been waiting to
turn 18 since I was born I'm someone who
feels the need to be really independent
I love my alone time
I love making my own decisions and I
feel like 18 is the year that you can
start making our decisions you can get
tattoos you can vote if you didn't know
my birthday is August 2nd it is what am
i filming it is Tuesday July 25th as I'm
filming this so my birthday will be in a
week from tomorrow that while I am NOT a
huge fan of birthdays just because the
pressure for a birthday party and like
making sure your birthday is great like
I don't really roll with that because I
have two high standards for myself and
I'm a perfectionist so I'm not like the
biggest fan of birthdays but I'm excited
for this birthday the day of my 18th I
am doing so much stuff that I would
never thought of that I would be doing
on my 18th and it's insane and yeah
anyways I'm not that made any sense but
yes I am so excited so Zoe from Paramore
asks do you plan on expanding your March
even more and girl yes I do so I really
wanted to talk about my March in this
video because there are a couple things
that have just come out that I've really
talked about which one is this necklace
I'm wearing it right now it is a little
lightning bolt and this is a choker you
can make it longer and make it shorter
so it's like perfect for any mixer as
you smoothly I'll add pictures of you
guys wearing it on the screen because
I've already gotten so many tweets and
pictures for you guys and it makes you
so happy to know that you guys love the
necklace as much as I do on the back it
says MJ on a little heart from Elle joy
of course or Michael Jordan or Michael
Jackson whoever you want on your neck
but yeah I didn't release it and I
haven't put in a video yet so I was like
oh my god I should put in a video so put
the link down below you can buy it at
love Jen and also if any of you guys
that define the necklace or whatever
tweet me or tag me on Instagram I like
your photos I'll follow you guys I just
I don't know it makes me so happy to see
you guys wear the necklace so yeah and
then for the clothing side of March I
wanted to put this in a video because
you guys are like the people buying the
March and wearing the marks but I
honestly thought the best way to come
out with the new merch would be to ask
what you guys want to let me know it
down below leave a comment like if I
should do pink top sweatpants honestly
whatever you want and I just really want
to expand my merch line more come out
with hella ideas like I'm just feeling
so inspired recently so just stay tuned
to the merch the jewelry everything I
know I'm excited and I can hopefully
come out with some new stuff soon but
honestly leaving your feedback down
below on what you want and if you want
to see what merch I have now I'll put
the link down below it's always in my
description box I came out with a couple
new pieces that I don't know if I've
talked about a lot but it seduces mug
the deuces white zip up Hoodie teasing
ride deuces on the back did that make
any sense so to answer that question new
merch will be coming soon hopefully I'm
going to start working on it a lot but
yeah but yeah so really quickly I just
wanted to answer this one because I
think it's super important this question
is from Anna and she asked what is your
opinion on self-love so personally my
opinion on self-love is to love the
values
and I'm sorry for my language I think
self-love is so crazy important for an
individual for everyone I think it's the
number one thing that leads you to being
happy is to just love the hell out of
yourself you know be comfortable in your
own skin like I think the self love is
part one to living your life the way you
want to I don't know
so yeah self love love yourself you're
amazing I love you you should let me
help too so the next question is from LH
with a little queen Mogi because
groovier queen oh but yes have you
worked on finding or have you found your
own apartment yet I decided to announce
this now versus earlier because I didn't
know if actually it was all going to
happen and everything like that but now
it's official and it's so weird to say
this but your girl is getting her own
set of keys for her own apartment on her
18th birthday what though I wanted to
talk about this because I know I'm going
to get a lot of backlash about moving
out but I've been wanting to move out
for not like I hate my parents like I
need to get out of here whatever like I
love my parents but I am an online
school and I do spend every second of my
day usually at home a lot of the time
like until friends can hang out because
they have school that I'm not at and
stuff like that and my parents are also
like kind of tired so we just spend a
lot of time together and I think
everyone gets to a point where they just
spend too much time with a person and it
starts having a bad impact on their
relationship do you know what I mean I
love my parents to death and I would
never want anything like that between us
I don't really want to talk about my
family situation on the internet because
it's like my family nothing like that
but like we're good I love my family but
I just think it's better for me to get
my own place for a couple reasons um the
first being I am such an independent
person I love learning on my own I love
doing a lot of stuff on my own I used to
be the opposite of that I used to be
such an extrovert like always wanted to
hang out with people all this stuff and
now I felt like I'm an introvert I'm
still like a little extra a little
introvert because I realized like I know
what I love doing and it's YouTube and
it's vlogging and it's all this stuff
and I just want to be in an environment
where I feel like I can do that by
myself or with friends or with anyone
whenever I want you guys can still see
my parents as vlogs and videos and all
that stuff because I'm so going
hang out with them the soda Grover I'm
going to come over you know I don't mean
any of this moving out to some spoils
and like whatever like I'm so grateful
that I can move out and try to think
that it's insane
YouTube is insane so just thank you for
your support and your love and like it's
so surreal but it's what I've wanted for
so long it's so crazy to me that this is
happening whoa this is mad mad rush mad
yeah I'm like so stoked and if you're
wondering where the apartment is I
bought an apartment in the Bay Area
which I'm currently living you know with
my family in the bay my plan right now
is to move to LA you know after I
finished high school just because that's
where I feel like I can focus on YouTube
the most and like that's kind of just
where everything is for social media
influencers so I feel like that's the
place I need to be so if you're like why
you banging play series you're going to
move to LA like the point is I'm buying
an apartment for a year in the bay for
my senior year to my parents and I think
it's just going to be too much for me to
move out cold turkey you know on my own
right after high school because I lived
with them my whole life
and I rely on my parents so much they're
like my best friend you know so we
thought it would be too hard for me like
emotionally and mentally too and also
physically just to move out and be gone
you know be hours away from my parents
and I can't just come home whenever I
want to see that so and now to talk
about the fun stuff at my apartment not
all the reasons I'm moving out and all
the disclaimers and all that stuff I am
just so excited because I have so many
video ideas I am going to start using my
blog channel more than you guys know I
am so excited I want to start like daily
vlogging not everyday but like most days
I'm gonna start a new segment around my
guy friends and like all my friends in
love with them and do fun challenges in
my apartment and all that stuff I just
want to put out so much more content
than I've been doing because making
content filming content editing content
is my favorite thing right but when
you're not in the right environment you
can't really do it to the best of your
ability like you wish you could I don't
know I feel like I don't really need to
expend myself to why I'm moving out but
I think it will just be a really good
transition period for me to answer your
question I did find an apartment it was
the first apartment I looked at and I
fell in love instantly I looked at so
many other ones and I was like no like
this one is this was it so yeah stay
tuned for that I'm too excited guys not
even to just move out and
I have an apartment but like all this
stuff I'm about to do all the videos I'm
about a film approved so I'm super
excited to put all that content out for
you guys but if you do have any video
suggestions for my blog channel or with
my guys or with all my friends let me
know down below and I'll definitely do
those I don't know if super excited so
thank you so jess says how do you feel
changing as a person will affect YouTube
like changing content or possibly
posting less or more etc and that's a
super cool question because that's
pretty much what this whole video is
about I'm hoping that once all this
busyness of packing and whatever and
just so much going on for real that I
can just focus the hell out of both my
YouTube channels my entry on my snapchat
just be so active with you guys because
that's how it used to be when I wasn't
as busy and I loved it if you want to
subscribe to my blog channel you don't
have to but if you want to see the other
videos we're about to put out or I'm
about to put out my friends and
everything Thanks the link is down below
go crazy what it is from this question
I'm going to say that content may be
changing but mostly on my blog channel
just because I've always been scared to
do like vlogs and challenges because I
feel like they have only been my style
like on my channel but I've always
wanted to do them so like why not just
use the crap on my blog channel double
the content I guess I don't know so I
think it's definitely going to be
posting more than less when you asked
which I'm really excited about
I think this change on YouTube with me
moving out you know growing up really
focusing on what I love I think it'll
hopefully be a way better change for my
youtube and for all my social media and
everything just because I just want to
do new stuff bro I just want to try
everything and have fun with it
I literally been so giddy this whole
video it's just I'm gonna answer a
couple like personal questions also just
throw it in because I don't think I have
any more updates and if I forget I'm
literally gonna be so mad at myself so
grace Prince asks and grow specialist
and I'm Joseph Reese's is making
yourself happy and more important than
making others happy PS I love you and I
love you more let's see that's a good
question I think you should be your top
priority but you also shouldn't turn
yourself into your top priority is like
a bad thing and as an asshole you know
like nah
I come first get on my lane you know
like that's like a different way of
putting yourself first than just
thinking about your own like health then
like you as an individual because in the
end it's your life and you
know how long these people are going to
be with you with scary so scary but it's
true but I try to balance it in fact
where I try to you know not put myself
in positions where I know I wouldn't be
happy and I would be anxious and
whatever find a balance for yourself
because everyone's different you have to
think about yourself and care for
yourself so I think if you find a way to
do that but also not hurt others around
you you've got a figured out girl you've
got it figured out so I actually think
those are all the questions I'm going to
answer for this Q&amp;amp;A just because I
talked a lot about each question because
your girl is the Rambo look I love you
guys to infinity and beyond I mean it
when I say it and I hope you know that
and I hope that you're having a
marvelous morning afternoon or night I
just realized my hair looks like some
ago but I love you guys
deuces I was into the coloring books
okay okay on you soldiers Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
