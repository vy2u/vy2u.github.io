No oh no that was a fall so it today I'm
trying to film as best as I can with
this little bugger next to me say hi to
me
thank you scared of the light oh my god
Kevin okay this video is gonna new
challenge because I have this little
rascal with me and he requires attention
24/7 wow wow he's really into teething
right now try bass feel free to follow
his Instagram am i making one did you
have an interview baby it's Travis
abduct the dog a lot of usernames were
taken for Travis the dog I don't know
why ok cool Travis and if you're new to
my channel and haven't seen my face or
this little boy out these before stop it
then make sure to hit that subscribe
button down below and I see do you know
where it is
I'm really excited to film this video
because I've recently gotten really into
like accessorizing and jewelry hats
beanies ya know I would be any like all
the time I feel like I've worn a baby in
every video recently honestly being
either like back if you don't want to do
your hair and if you die or like me and
you have some root issues you feel me
like they grow out and yeah so while I
was looking for accessories online I
came across this website
everything is $1.00 on the website I'm
not even kidding I've got like 30 things
I think and it was $30 and I'm talking
like packs of earrings like rings
bracelets whatever I've never seen this
place before and I was like one dollar
accessories like they're either gonna be
a hit or miss because it's hard to make
good quality things for a dollar I feel
like or maybe it's not an all getting
ripped off by other companies I don't
know my baby we fell asleep finally
yes really Friday so it's miss a this is
not sponsored and nothing like that I
found a website myself and I wanted to
try it out let's get into the unboxing
because I'm really excited unboxing a
packaging it's not a box it's packaged
oh it smells really weird comes in a
nice little package yeah I ordered 25
items
and the total was $25 that's crazy
I'm looking at these things and a lot of
them are like four pair earrings set
three pair six pair they're things like
that and that's like crazy for a dollar
like yeah give it to me oh my god whoa
all right so this is everything take it
out I guess I'm gonna go through it no
oh my god there's just so much I'm gonna
start with hoop because I bought oh my
god so many wow this is crazy I don't
remember buying this much okay now I'm
like never gonna run out who's so the
first thing is six different sizes in
this I mean I haven't like worn them and
whatever but they look like sweeps they
look good
Wow I'm like really happy with myself I
think $25 for all of this and I need to
open it but I'm just like away so then I
got these hoops which are also silver
but they're bigger there's different
designs I guess these ones like woven
and then these I'm just sort of like
lines I don't know but I like them
they're really big so yeah Wow these are
killer bees I think I got them mostly
for the gold hoop part I think I also
wanted to see the earrings
the diamonds are really big so big for
me but goal to designs on them good
sized pearls and the gold little studs
clear cells and stuff for like 20 and
this is a dollar I'm sorry but I'm so
impressed so far why should I put them
all on and they just all break though so
now I got these silver hoops Wow these
when something dive into light you just
tell these are like super not good
quality okay when did my nail break I
just noticed that wait what
I'm so sad ignore that I'm so sorry that
is
Wow so yeah I got even more silver hoops
they really look like the other ones
with different sizing but yeah I'd say
this place is great if you like hoops
because they got quite the variety I
think I ordered some of the stuff and
duplicates because I like silver and
gold and they were a dollar so I was
like why not so I also got the same ones
as these in gold yeah wow I I have a lot
of Hoops now overall like they look good
quality like when I look at them success
is a fake diamond ones like if you can
just see the spacing between them I
don't I don't think you're gonna be able
to see if you can just like tell with
you look it is like girl would you get
those other than the diamond ones I'm
like super pleased like these look
really good you know it's not like it's
a weird color or anything oh my god so
much stuff this is crazy
Wow wow that's intense looks like that
can you see it's like chains I didn't
really think it was gonna be this big
I'm excited to see how long the like
diamonds last in the products and see if
they like fall out soon or if it turns
my skin green because a lot of my rings
do that and I just not for it okay this
one is cool
this was $1.00 this one this you can see
it I don't know how to describe this one
but I really like it and I like how its
adjustable it's not a lot of rings are
adjustable yeah no oh this one's kind of
pretty so I got this ring because I
think I wanted to test out how the
diamond has looked on the ring see if
they look like real it or not because if
you're like wearing a $1 looking diamond
ring like girl it's pretty it's a little
too engagement ring looking for me you
know one day when I want to be IC wifey
then I wear this I just really got
engaged okay I got five more rings so
we're working with okay yeah no no this
one looks pretty fake to me I mean duh
$1 but like - that's one trend just I
don't think I would wear it I don't know
I mean honestly I'm just showing you
guys this
why I'm trying to like review and
everything I don't feel about it but got
that so this one this hearts on it I
didn't know they were hurt I don't know
why I just don't really like wearing
like heart rings like hearts all over it
not really a fan but you know it's cute
it's dainty and it's like really not bad
oh this one what okay I like this one
this one looks like a braid almost I
hope you can see these I don't like
woven or something but I really like
this I think it's gonna actually put
this phone right now but it also came
with this one and I actually think it
would be cuter without the little like
silver circle on it like it was just
that chain looking things but it's still
cute though
and then this one also came with it I
think it's just a diamond as you can see
but like not a real diamond like it
shape of them and really quickly I got
two anklets I used to love anklets when
I was in middle school I thought it was
like the most tumblr looking thing ever
I don't even know but I loved it but
these look like almost like the argument
my chokers but literally for your ankles
I just got the silver and the gold and
that actually look really cute I think
in the summer like a bathing suit and
the like a ton of jewelry like ankle and
city its oh look it's the look oh and
then I got this necklace oh yeah baby
I'm gonna describe this but it's cool
like it's not chain but it's like
thicker I got a good amount of earrings
but first these the first two were just
like I'm looking studs but they're cubic
zirconia and then the bottom ones I
don't even know my toes are they have
like little bows on them can you see I'm
really hoping you can see these but yeah
I like the first two you're not sure how
I feel about the last there but I'll
probably actually wear the first two
just like for everyday weird and then I
got these which are wow they're big
cubic zirconia earrings the very blingy
looking over your diamond
looking hearings but these are blini
these are like pal like hello
but for $1 like okay these are pretty so
I got these earrings which are Dingley
like I don't know not tassels these look
really good quality I have a dollar
I'm actually like thoroughly impressed
by this website these are really cool
they they look kind of like the other
ones I got but cool but they have this
gold like border on them
they look like expensive a dollar a
dollar yeah
with it I'm with it along with like
jewelry and accessories like that they
also have like makeup brushes and thanks
to clean your makeup brushes so I got
this brush cleaning egg clean their
brushes on this side it's just a little
egg so I also got some makeup brushes
from man what this is soft okay so I got
the egg 19 and I think I might use this
for like setting powder under the eyes
or something but this is stupid soft
like oh okay wait if they're all this
soft I'm gonna be really excited okay so
I got that high def brush in E 104 and
it's so soft too oh my god they're all
this soft
oh geez I'm excited for F 10 and E one
hundred and ten I'll probably use this
to like get that dog to a really sharp
with them like setting powder and then
this moment too is really cool and I
think I'll use this for setting powder
under my eyes when I want to like make a
winged effect the high def F 10 e 110
and then this one I just got the f-14
which just looks like a little contour
brush um but it's super soft as well
okay yeah if you need makeup brushes go
check out this place because there's oh
it's soft what my camera is about to die
perfect timing because I just finished
going through it all that was a lot of
pieces honestly I would suggest this
website to anyone who's looking for
inexpensive accessories because they
look really good quality and they look
really like pretty when you look at them
I'm really excited to see how while they
last and like how they hold up when I
wear them and stuff but yeah I hope you
