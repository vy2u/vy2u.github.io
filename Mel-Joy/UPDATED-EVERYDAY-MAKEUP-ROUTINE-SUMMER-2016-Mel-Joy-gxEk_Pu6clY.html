is going to be an everyday makeup
routine for the summertime this is an
updated makeup routine I definitely
don't like wearing as much makeup as I
do and the other times of the years in
the summer because it's hot out I feel
like first of all I'm gonna sweat it off
and second of all wait that's for and
second of all this is also the time that
you can let your skin breathe let your
freckles show you know you can get a tan
on all that stuff I don't wear this
everyday I don't wear makeup every day
in the summer definitely not if I do
wear makeup I'll probably wear something
along these lines so yeah I don't know
what else to say except for if you want
to see how to get this look then what
does really then you should just you
know keep on watching so let's get
started so I have nothing on my face so
the very first thing I like to do is
moisturize my lips and I'm taking my EOS
chapstick and just applying that I'm
gonna do a talk there tutorial just
because I feel like it's just more like
101 like what I'm taking my Clinique
dramatically different moisturizer and I
am applying this all over my face this
is hands-down my favorite moisturizer
cover
don't forget about Thousand Islands then
I'm taking my Maybelline Baby skin
primer and I'm just taking a little bit
of this on my finger and applying this I
have the most issues with my pores so
like around the nose a little bit on the
forehead on my chin and I'm just rubbing
this in circles this name is not wrong
it makes your skin feel so soft once
that is all massaged in I am taking my
concealer and I usually use the NARS
creamy concealer but I feel like it's a
little too like heavy weight I don't
know for the summer I like to go more
natural in the summer so I take my
Maybelline a better skin concealer in
light 20 and I'm just applying this
under my eyes and then where I have any
redness and yeah then I'm taking my damp
Beauty Blender it's the concealer one
and I'm just going to blend this in
finish all we're doing and then I'm also
to my eyelids as well because I have
pretty veiny eyelids so I just like to
you know cover that up and I recently
got these Beauty blenders because I was
like yeah I use brushes like I don't
know if this whole hype thing is about
and if you guys don't have a Beauty
Blender and I've been wanting to try it
and I don't know just go for it because
I love it I definitely know what the
hype is all about now I'm also taking my
age rewind concealer and applying this
on my nose and on my mouth because I
like really right there I don't I just
do I'm also blending it on my nose a
little bit because my nose gets super
super red after I'm done with that I go
in with my okay I'm still going to
butcher this one a slant on BB cream and
this is so cool it comes in like this
thing like that and there's also a
little cushion that comes with it that
you like precedent but I just use my
Beauty Blender and I just press it in
like this I love using Beauty creams in
the summertime because they have SPF in
them and it's just lighter on your skin
you know it's like a tinted moisturizer
and it will keep your skin not dry so
I'm just packing this kind of all over
my face and I love this stuff it gives
such like a natural finish but still
covers up everything that I want it to
cover up and make sure to blend it down
your neck as well and what I also like
about this if I do have any like redness
or freckles or anything on my face like
it covers it up but it also kind of
shows it too so it still looks like you
know you have like skin not just like a
perfect thanks I'm the why I'm showing
up so pale on camera I don't look this
pale in person I promise so after I'm
done with that I'm taking my Laura
Mercier translucent powder I'm taking a
knock off Beauty Blender and dabbing it
in and then making my concealer I'm also
going to put a little bit on my chin
okay so as I'm waiting for this to set I
am going to just come out my eyebrows I
don't do anything to my eyebrows except
for : ah I just take a spoolie it has no
product nothing on it and I literally
just call mom I pretty naturally thick
eyebrows so I don't like to fill them in
because then they just look super
dramatic so yeah so that's all I get for
my brows I just come through like this
kind of up and then brush them over you
know just put it in to place so after
I'm done with that I don't let it like
bake that long what I do is I just take
some of the Laura Mercier powder that's
in the lid I swirl my little Ecotools
kabuki brush and then I just put this
all over my face to set you BB cream and
I also blend in the under eyes under the
lid of the world and now I'm taking the
honest hacia glow kit and I've been
obsessed with this recently
I mean who hasn't been and then I'm
taking just this little essence brush
taking crushed pearl which is a gorgeous
gorgeous highlight and I'm just putting
this on my cheekbones and kind of
smiling seeing where the light falls and
just blending it up oh yeah can we see
it I'm also putting some on my nose just
a little bit and a little on my keep
it's been a little stab Wever you know
so I usually use the hoola bronzer for
my bronzer which is matte and like I
love that look but for the summer I was
like you know what I feel like the glowy
look is so in so recently I've been
taking mimosa which is like a brownie
brownie a brown color it's kind of
similar to a little bit of shimmery and
I've just been taking my bronzing brush
and I've been bronzing with that and I
don't know I've actually been really
liking it it's not super shimmery or
anything and then nothing like the
highlight but I feel like it just
creates a really natural glowy look and
then she's you know that's what I'm
going for in the summer time and I feel
like it also blends really well with
highlight and then I just put this on my
jaw line a little bit on my temples on
the top of my forehead
maybe the
I know I just think it looks really
natural and pretty gift yep so then
after I'm done with all that I just take
my ELF powder brush and this has nothing
on it and I just blend it because I
don't want any harsh lines I want to
look in that role and yeah so now that
we are all blended out because we've
gone to the eyes you can't tell I have
eyelash extensions because I'm obsessed
eyelash extensions but I do do a little
bit of eye shadow sometimes I'll just
skip eye shadow entirely because I'm
lazy I just I you know it's summer you
don't have too much makeup but if I do I
take my large Pro palette and I take the
color buff which is just it's like a
white eggshell matte color and I just
try this all over the lid up to my brow
bone and then after I'm done with that I
will take the color light brown which is
just a matte brown color and then my
Lexi 229 tapered blending brush and just
roll it in it top it off and then apply
this right into my crease just to add
some definition to my eye now it's gonna
be a little crazy but you're taking my
ecotools blending brush and we just
blend in all of this out and I also
sometimes if I'm feeling it take just
this what is this this is the Coastal
Scents
the RC no.2 brush and then I'll take
snow from this palette it's just a
really shimmery white and I'll apply
this in my inner corners just to get
that awake look you know like it opens
the eyes up a lot and just looks really
clean and now it looks like I got some
sleep last night and I also like taking
crushed pearl from the Beverly Hills
highlight as well and applying this just
under my brow bone a little bit just so
it hits that like you know if the brown
like went on too much of the eyelid I'll
just apply some of the white eyeshadow
just to the center of my lid so that for
eyeliner the first thing I do is I take
my Rimmel eyeliner and this is in what
is this in 213 in the nude I applied to
my waterline
and this is just going to make your eyes
appear bigger and brighter and then I'm
taking this essence smoky two-in-one
Kohl eyeliner and this stuff is so
strong guys when you touch it it'll just
go everywhere what I do with this is I
apply this to my tight line on my upper
lash line
sometimes I'll fight like it's actually
eyeliner if I you know I'm feeling it
and summertime I just like to wear less
makeup so I'll just apply it to my tight
line like so it'll just darken your eyes
up a little bit make your eyelashes
appear thicker I like this stuff because
it just adds more definition to your
eyes after I'm doing that I take this
elf waterproof eyeliner pencil in black
and I apply this on my bottom lash line
I try to apply this under the nude
eyeliner so I still keep the look of
these big eyes and that just adds a lot
more definition to my eyes after that
I'm going to comb out to my eyelash
extensions and I just take a little
spooley that the girl gave me at my
place and I just comb them out so
there's no clumpy ones and this was
actually the most dramatic I've ever run
my eyelashes because I'm going on a
cruise and I'm not gonna be like wearing
any makeup or anything so I was like you
know I just want my eyes to look done up
and the next thing I'm taking is my
better than sex mascara and this is a
bomb mascara and I'm just applying this
to my bottom lashes and then what I like
to do is take my covergirl clump crusher
mascara and just go over this and then
also just get the outer corners of my
eye really well because the tip is
smaller and if I got any mascara I just
take my spoolie I dab it off and then if
my mascara looks clumpy I'll take my
little eyelash eyebrow comb and I will
comb through them this is from Ecotools
moving on to lips when I first do is I
take my ELF lip exploiter and I exploit
my lips because I don't want try
lipstick sometimes I don't even put
anything on my lips because I but today
I'll just you know I'll put them on I
really like nudes for the summertime and
like glossy lips so I've been using this
barely-there 53 Milani lipstick is just
a gorgeous nude color and I'll just
apply that to my lips like so and then
the last thing I do is I take my Urban
Decay the trusty
nighter makeup setting spray hold it a
little far back I do a press like so and
then maybe another one and this just
helps assure that I makeup will stay on
all day so yeah this is the look I hope
