matte lip stains though here we're done
hey guys it's me Mel and if you're
wondering what's up with the background
I'm experimenting I don't know
today his video is going to be a super
actually probably my most requested that
a wet probably my most requested video
ever is going to be an updated workout
routine I get so many requests from you
guys to do that just because I gotten to
help kick recently I've lost some weight
I started eating healthier things like
that make sure to give this video a
thumbs up if it helps you in any way so
I know and I can do more kind of health
and fitness videos because I really do
feel passionate about health and fitness
so and also if you're new to my channel
hi I'm Mel nice to meet you and if
you're not already subscribed I would
love it if you did so it would make my
heart really happy we're almost at
500,000 I can't believe it this is crazy
what is going on thank you guys so much
you guys are amazing I could talk about
you guys forever honestly like my kids
like I could brag about you forever and
right before I get into this video a
little disclaimer I am NOT an expert in
any way shape or form I've just done my
own research on it I found what works
best for me would I like things like
that also if you're wondering how often
I do this workout it honestly like
changes like you know they'll be weeks
where I'm just feeling it and I will do
it like five times a week my stores
almost every day and then you whatever I
wanted but that is completely changed
I've kind of done a video on that and I
can do more videos on that if you want
to see those but pretty much I changed
my eating lifestyle a lot more I'm
eating so much healthier now and I also
turned to vegan if you didn't know that
now I feel like I have to workout a
little less just because I'm not
stuffing myself with really bad for you
food I will try to do it at least three
times a week sometimes four five I don't
know it really depends how I feel at
that time I don't know what to say
except that I hope you guys enjoy this
video because you guys have been asking
for
for such a long time without further ado
let's get started so the first thing
that I always have to do when I work out
is to listen to music I use my Spotify
you can follow me smell joy be myself a
medal two L's and then I just put up my
workout playlist it has the best working
out songs I get you pumped up and the
first thing I do is 15 minutes of the
elliptical for my cardio because I don't
like running so I just do this and I do
it on like the know setting like level 1
or whatever so I'll just do that and I
kind of go fairly fast and keep a good
pace so I just do that to get my cardio
in and then for my legs and my butt the
first thing I do are these I think hip
abductions and I have a hip problem so I
have to do things like this to
strengthen my hips and this you just
push out and I think I did this with 50
pounds so I just did that like 30 of
those and then I did this one which is
kind of the same thing but you push like
out that helps the inside of your legs
and I did this with 40 pounds and this
just helps your hips and yeah so I just
do that and then the next thing I do is
I do 30 donkey leg kicks of things on
each side this helps with your lower
butt and thighs and your legs and all
that good stuff so I just do 30 on my
right side and 30 on my left side so
after that I do these like side donkey
kicks which also helps your hips like
your outer glutes and things like that
because I have tendinitis in my gluts so
I just do those to help strengthen that
and also make sure to drink water
because that is super important when
working out so here's me drinking some
water and then here are these like hip
raises yeah they're like thrusts
actually um and these just help your
lower butt and your thighs and just all
your legs and your hips so I just do 30
of these and I'll also get this like
fancy 12 pound weight if I'm feeling it
you know it's a lot harder so I'll just
do like 30 to 50 depending
and how I feel so after that I do 30
squats and my form is kind of bad here
sorry about that make sure your knees
don't go in front of your toes but I
just take a 25 pound dumbbell and I'll
just do 30 squats to help your butt in
your legs and then now I do lunges and
these also help my glutes a lot and I'll
just do 15 on each side with this 25
pound weight I believe it was I'll do 15
to 30 depending how I feel that day but
yes I'll just do that on each of my legs
and make sure to keep your back really
straight when you bend down and make
sure not to have your knee go over your
toes either so then now these are like
side squats kind of unknown what they're
called but you just kind of use one your
legs to squat and these are hard
honestly so I just do I think 15 of
these on each side and that just helps
strengthen like your individual leg you
know one at a time so then moving on the
ABS this is my favorite part of my
workout the first thing I do are these
crunches type thing but I keep my legs
up and this just makes it harder so I'll
do 30 I'll do 40 of these actually I'll
do like 40 of these and yeah so then
after those I do like these leg lifts
and this helps with your lower abs and
I'll do about 30 sometimes more of these
I love these ones so I'll just kind of
bring my legs up lift my pelvis and yes
I do those and that helps with your
lower abs and it's a good time
so after that up to these bicycle
thingies and I just do 30 of these I'll
just go back and forth and have my
opposite leg touch my opposite arm yeah
so I'll just do those and these are
awesome for your abs so after this these
are like running man's some things but
sometimes I'll do them with my arms up
or down as you can see and this helps
with the side of your abs also you feel
it in your legs too and your arms so
this is a great workout so after I do
like 30 of those I will do a plank it
depends how long I want to hold the
plank for it can be anywhere from
literally 30 seconds to like as long as
I can how many ever minutes but so I
just fold a plank and then after I'm
done with the plank I do these like arm
things they help with your arms and your
abs you feel this so much in your side
abs so I just do this and I do about 15
of these just because I don't like
working on my arms too much just because
I have pretty like like muscular ish
arms from doing basketballs so I don't
do that as much but after I do these I
will do like five push-ups sometimes
more if I'm feeling it but I just kind
of like to do that to just end my own
workout there um sometimes I'll do them
where I'm touching the floor completely
like I'll have to put my whole body down
flat and that works out your arms really
well because you'll have to like put
yourself back up all the way but yeah
after I do that to complete my workout I
like to kind of bring my heart rate up a
little bit so I'll go on the treadmill
in here I have the incline at 15 which
is the highest it goes and I think the
speed was 2.6 I'll go anywhere from like
that to like a little less than four I
don't want to I don't want it to be a
jog or anything but here I'm just doing
kind of like lunges or I'm kind of like
bending my legs on the treadmill
sometimes I'll do this sometimes I won't
and I'll just walk but this helps your
legs so it's like a workout as you're
you know just walking so I'll do these
they feel these so that's just kind of a
good way to end my workout because I
bring my heart rate up and you know so
now I'm stretching because you should
definitely always stretch when you work
out and stuff so yeah I'm just doing
that so I don't hurt myself in any way
if you know what I'm saying so yeah I'm
just pretty much doing whatever I feel
like I worked out in my workout so I
hope you guys enjoyed my workout routine
that is pretty much what my workout
consists of sometimes I'll change it up
a little bit but this is actually like
pretty much what I do I do this a lot
