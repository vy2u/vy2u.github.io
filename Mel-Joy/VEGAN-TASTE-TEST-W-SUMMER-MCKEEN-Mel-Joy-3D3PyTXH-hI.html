from my channel that was great thank you
oh she's off oh and also we filmed a
truth or dare on here yeah do so yeah if
we did that a little crazy it's pretty
face today we're going to be doing a
vegan taste test because I feel like
veganism is really big right now yeah
you guys I know I'm newly vegan too so
really thank you this will be exciting
to try out some new things there's some
like kind of weird things and then some
good things I try to get like a variety
I don't know should we just get started
yeah sure I'm like really picky I I'm
not vegan I really want to be vegan but
it's so hard like I could go without
eating meat but like being a vegan this
is not dairy and eggs is actually hard
because it's in a lot of things that you
would have is an amazing Oh so the first
thing that I'm Lin said before actually
are these dippers but the thing that I
looked at them and I was like what it
says cheesy and like you can't eat
cheese is a B yeah obviously not real
cheese yeah yeah definitely it's
broccoli cauliflower and carrot crunches
sweat in a world and it's cheesy
flavored so that's the first thing we're
gonna be trying out what is it like
yeast yeah nutritional yeah that's
supposed to be like oh okay oh you smell
that
Oh eat like waters oh yeah sure you
wanna this looks like something bad I
gotta broccoli I don't know you got it
one's huge
okay I'm not involving a broccoli
evening when else is the carrot and
cauliflower it's organic too good this
is like very healthy I assume thank you
oh okay it's not as bad as I thought but
like it's not super like cheesy hey can
I just like dog food I try not doesn't
really yeah Oh me I'm boom I'm on fan
mmm mmm nope that's a note from you I
don't know I don't like it but I don't
hate it but I don't think I would choose
to eat this over other food but like I
was there honestly I'm someone that like
if there's food in front of me home
that's kind of true like it's not
horrible I could be worried yeah five
out of ten I got give us six the second
thing which I was really excited for
another you like brownies yeah I love
brownies cocoa runes mini brownie and
it's just a little mini brownie and I
was like oh I am really cute by the time
thing is like here they go vegan package
Yahoo to it I don't
you can't have chocolate anymore except
for like super dark you know like
semi-sweet drama because that's like
just literally straight-up cookout no
we're gonna look cute when you're bites
that's so cute I'm into it oh yeah
little ball good one two three
I was like hold on mm-hmm mm-hmm
oh man how do you the whole bag I know
me too it says but you can't just eat
one mm-hmm Joe doesn't like tastes like
a brownie not at all
but like it's kind of just like a little
coconut chocolate thing but like it's
good it just doesn't taste like a
brownie does that make sense yeah so for
that reason I think I gave it a t9
editor yeah probably like an eight nine
kind of excited for this because I used
to eat yogurt all the time but not like
I can and this is dairy-free yogurt and
it's strawberry flavored I really want
to know what it is
no no it's soy milk everything is so I
don't like this we have like a huge
spoon and then a smaller Saigon
something's a bigger rock look well the
consistency looks like you they're right
one two three
that tastes scarily like yogurt yeah but
the aftertaste is a little more like
thinner yeah
after Jace is a little different but I
like it here do Girt yeah I would eat
this I want to give you honestly I would
hmm I think I'm gonna give it like an
eight yeah same eight out of ten okay
these I'm really scared for so their
power raps but they're Texas DBQ flavor
no well I don't know they're like trying
to do beef jerky
I guess exactly right I don't know like
what do you think they put in it's like
sunflower seeds molasses women Tomatoes
yeah if it's good then happily yeah they
look like like dog treats like
everything in this is like gosh it
smells like it smells like what is that
that's the big thing
it smells like big yeah it looks like on
the inside
one day I just put the whole thing on
polish it a bit it tastes like beef
jerky mm-hmm I got that weird
it smells like fake and it tastes like a
stirrer tastes like beef jerky it
honestly like 100% how do they do that
like I don't know it's spicy we have it
like the aftertaste is a little bit like
definitely not be drinking like I can
kind of taste the fig a little bit what
you want to know
hey Adam says no this cuz you said wait
have you hey I see hate like I know when
you smell something you can like go
check I think I would give that like
honestly maybe a three or four yeah um I
give it like a five because it actually
did taste like yeah I just don't love
beef jerky anyway so the next thing is
this seaweed snack oh this is like
protein iron energy vitamins music oh so
it looks like healthy but vegetable
garden flavor if that interesting I
wonder if they put like other vegetables
in women because they had other flavors
but the flavors are like Thai and stuff
oh I've had seaweed before I don't
remember if I liked it or not really I
don't think I like sea I've had like the
Trader Joe's ones where they're like oh
wow those are good I like those it looks
like this a little sketchy
oh I got faith in you I'm into it it's
actually really good
I'm gonna eat these like for fun it's a
good snack mm-hmm like if I was craving
chips and our vegan I would just eat
these it's kind of sweet
mm-hmm like this could cure sweet tooth
honestly I'm really into this mm-hmm
this was a good purchase I'm having
about this now yeah okay so I'm gonna
give that like ten of them a nine out of
ten because the next thing mmm our bar
I've never tried one of these but what
people tell me is the cool thing about
these is that there's like no
ingredients there's like cashews dates
and like semi-sweet chocolate and like
that's it yeah I don't put anything else
in it and that means that like you know
it's good chocolate chip cookie dough
and I wanted to try this flavor because
I feel like it could cure sweet - yeah I
doubt this will taste bad
I know oh it even looks like like you
can like see the angry yeah that's so
cool yeah
mmm-hmm
it tastes like cookie dough yeah that's
crazy
I'm definitely getting the key it's like
really smooth - I think it looks kind of
chunky but it's not at all mmm good like
a lot China out of time mm-hmm and it's
gluten free - that's literally just like
raw ingredients mmm way out you're gonna
cookie oh yeah B of cookies Oh
Vanilla's snack arune's oh there you go
me max over coconut goodness I think
you're gonna be similar to these yeah
but like cuz I thought these are like
gonna be more brownie ish but I know I
love coconut I don't know if you're fan
yeah cuz I was like what are these
called macaroons right oh they had lemon
and chocolate but oh cool this big oh
pretty
yes hmm hmm very very coconut mmm it's
good
mm-hmm I like it yeah I like these I
think this would be nice snack mm-hmm
and sends it's vanilla flavor it
literally just tastes like you're eating
like polka
yeah like straight-up coca like oh my
it's like focus yes no messy but I give
this a 10 hunt me to the last thing and
definitely I think the most interesting
thing is you chicken
like chicken tenders but meat free yeah
but it's not chicken so they're seven
grain crispy tenders like let's just
take a moment it smells like chicken did
yeah it looks like chicken hmm and it's
not chicken it's like oh boy I'm so
excited if this tastes like chicken I
will just I'll eat this me too yeah so
this is what it looks like oh
because we just put in the microwave I
better taste better for you like toasted
it okay ready yeah let's do it
what why didn't like look it looks like
chick it looks like chicken it has the
texture of chicken a taste like chicken
how do they do it
I don't think you know bite me - it's
good it's a little like smoother than
chicken mm-hmm but like I don't mind it
like it yeah it's good how did they get
this like texture of chicken I don't
understand it looks like chicken I don't
know these people are smart though
mm-hmm I'm giving this a 10 out of 10
I should have these at McDonald's yeah
they should they should have like a
vegan option it would do really well I
think oh yeah yeah this is 10 is like a
lemon Oh Danny no I'm just a thief -
they have so much stuff on this road
like be weird I 100 calories I
think that'd be such a good snack some
ketchup
I don't know I'm into it okay like
