really different so today I'm going to
be doing a vampire makeup tutorial for
Halloween this is a scary makeup look
not like a sexy sultry makeup look if
you guys want one of those so no yeah
that's kind of the finished look I think
a vampire is a really easy and fun thing
to be for Halloween so if you guys want
if you how to get this look stay tuned
and keep watching so the first thing I'm
doing I'm taking a light concealer the
lightest one I have I don't have a light
foundation or anything so I'm just kind
of using this as a foundation and I'm
just putting that all over my face and
rubbing it in and then I'm setting it
with a powder and then I am just putting
a primer on my lids to make sure that
eyeshadow stay all night
and here I'm contouring my face with a
purple eyeshadow to really make the
hollows of my cheeks looks define me
kind of spooky like a vampire and then
here I'm taking a reddish eyeshadow mine
turned out to be a little bit more
Orange which kind of upset me but it's
okay so use a red one and then I'm
taking this dark black and putting that
in the corner
and then a little gold on it too just a
little accent and then I'm putting the
same eyeshadows under my eye and then
I'm taking a white eyeliner putting that
on on my waterline to make me look more
awake in my eyes look bigger and I
definitely think this is really
important I am putting a pink eyeshadow
or purpley pink eyeshadow under my eyes
and on top of my eyes and that really
really just makes it look more
flesh-like and Here I am taking a red
lip liner and I am just putting little
lines under my eyes to make look like
little veins and I'm just kind of
experimenting with this and then after
that I am taking a purple eyeshadow and
I'm just putting that on top to make it
look more vain life because veins are
kind of purply and then here I took a
bright purple eyeshadow and I put that
under my eyes and this is really just
enhancing me looking really sleepy and
tired and like I didn't get any sleep at
all
and then here I'm taking my liquid
eyeliner and I am applying a winged
eyeliner to my upper lash line to just
add a little more of a dramatic effect
here I'm taking a black eyeliner and I'm
applying this on my waterline just in
the corner to make my eyes look a little
darker and smokier and then Here I am
curling my eyelashes and then I'm taking
a mascara and I'm just applying many
coats of these just to give my eyelashes
a false effect and I'm also applying
this to my lower eyelashes and then here
I'm just coming through my eyebrows I'm
not filling them in I just want to keep
them pretty sparse for this look and
then here I'm lightly lining my lips
with a red lip liner and then here I'm
taking a bright red matte lipstick and
I'm just applying this to my lips and
then I am applying a sparkly red lip
gloss to the inner parts of my lips to
add more definition and here I'm putting
it down the sides of my mouth and this
is supposed to look like blood I didn't
have fake blood or anything so I just
use this instead but I think it looked
pretty good and I'm also adding it into
the inner corners of my lips like a lot
to make it look like I'm dripping blood
not just blood on my face and this is
probably the most important part I am
adding my fake fangs that I got from the
Halloween store had these for a year
because I was a I was a vampire last
year but I think this adds the most to
the look and makes me look the most
realistic like a vampire thank you guys
so much for watching this video I'll see
you in my next one bye guys
shake shake shake sure - yeah
ya see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
