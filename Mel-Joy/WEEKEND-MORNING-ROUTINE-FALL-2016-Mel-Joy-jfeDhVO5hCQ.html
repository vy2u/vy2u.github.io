burrito in honor of me well there you go
you get it I'm a different person with
my morning coffee whoa hey guys it's me
Mel and today's video is going to be my
everyday nope is going to be my weekend
morning routine if you didn't know I do
online school so school morning routine
is pretty boring because I really don't
do anything so Phil I get up and then go
on my laptop to do school but if you
want to see that I can still do that for
you guys try to make it interesting
something like that if you're new to my
channel hey I'm Mel it's great to meet
you I would love it if you would
subscribe to my channel it'd make my
heart very happy I have faith you know
the button is pretty much you're just
gonna see my weekend morning routine
what I do you know on a Saturday Sunday
whatever and what I mean my morning
routine I mean my a hundred percent real
morning routine you know so yeah if you
want to see my morning routine then stay
tuned and keep watching I'm gonna be
honest a lot of YouTube videos and
movies make it seem like you wake up
like this every single morning like
you're so ready to take on the day but
no I'm sorry that's definitely not my
morning routine so we're gonna rewind
that and redo it so pretty much I wake
up and yeah that is more like it I'm
definitely not my happiest in the
morning but the first thing I do I'll
take my Lenovo two-in-one yoga book and
this thing is awesome because you can
see that it was just like a little
laptop and now it's a tablet um so I
love scrolling through Twitter
favoriting your guys's tweet seeing what
you're up to also go on like my other
social medias just chicken you know all
that good stuff I've told you guys this
before but I tend to have a lot of my
best ideas when I sleep I know that
sounds weird but this yoga book makes it
so easy to just like write down my ideas
on little like draw no pad it has and
you literally just draw on the keyboard
which is so cool so thank you to my
friends at Lenovo for sending me this
awesome a yoga book then I go to my
bathroom
put up my hair and I wash my face i'm
using my Neutrogena rapid clear foaming
scrub yeah and then I'm just washing
that off with cold water and this is
painful but you guys told me to use cold
water because it's better for your pores
so I do that now and then I'm taking my
clinic moisturizer I love this stuff and
putting that all over my face and then
I'm brushing my teeth with my toothpaste
you know the drill and just got to make
sure you stay hi Jenica you know then
after I am done brushing my teeth
actually I'm still brush my teeth now
not I go back in my room and I make my
bed I'm not like super amazingly neat
when it comes to making my bed because I
will be in it later so I just kind of
put my pillows on and stuff and then I
get dressed for the day I put on my work
out clothes so I'm ready to work out and
then I go downstairs and this is
probably my favorite part of my day is
my morning coffee I am just like I am
not the same person without my morning
coffee
I do the 12 ounces I have to use a big
cup so then I take my zero calorie
stevia stevia you guys told me it was
and then my soy milk and I put a little
bit of each of those in I've been liking
to have some iced coffee in the morning
so I'll just put some ice in it and then
I'll have my warm lemon water and my
granola and fruit I don't like eating
too much before I work out so I have a
little bit of granola and fruit just to
hold me over till I eat a really big
meal after my workout and watch some
youtube as I do that and then before I
go to the farmers market we like to make
a list and this feature is super cool
because like I was doing earlier you
could like draw on it or whatever but
here I just turned the keyboard on the
hallo keyboard and I'm writing a list
with the text option because I didn't
want to like handwrite everything you
know what I'm saying
shotgun farmers market me out we out
we're here I'm gonna buy some fresh
goods that what people say nice produce
fresh produce so then we'll go to the
farmers market and if you don't know
what this is it has like a ton of fruits
and vegetables which are my favorite
things so we'll get a ton of stuff and
if you're wondering what we ended up
getting you can just look at the final
list of everything crossed off that I
made on the
about jimta and so now I'm going to the
gym with my friend I like to work out on
the weekends a lot so then once we get
into the gym something that I really
like to do and have been doing a lot
recently is watching YouTube videos
while I work out which I know you might
be like what this tablet is so easy to
just take around for that reason how to
mix the time pass you know we're back
from the gym it was a success
got my salad you're going to eat it and
I'm gonna post a book then when I got
home I posted a vlog on my vlog channel
it was a story time of why I went to the
ER while I did that I was eating a salad
that I made it like this little salad
bar thing I'm vegan but I like loaded up
with vegetables and other protein
because I want to have like a filling
meal eating my salad and responding to
comments cuz I love you guys and then
I'm going to take a shower because I'm
sweaty and gross so I'm just doing that
and then I actually got ready for my day
but I actually recorded myself getting
ready so this is a get ready with me
video I'll link it down below you can
watch that if you want to see how I got
ready but yeah thank you guys so much
for watching my weekend morning routine
I hope you enjoyed and if you did make
sure to give it a thumbs up and comment
down below what your favorite day of the
week is cuz I know it's kind of cool I
have a guess of what it is but like you
know I love you guys to infinity and
beyond I mean it when I say it and I
hope you know that and I hope you're
having a marvelous morning afternoon or
night and I'll see you in my next video
