eat in a day video this was just a day
on the weekend this isn't what I eat
every day but yeah let's get started so
first I make my lemon water this is how
I start my day every single day I make
lemon water and then I just drink it
throughout the day I refill my water
bottle so I just made that and then my
coffee if you guys know I love my coffee
so I just take some instant coffee
pretty simple
and then my leaner creamer which is just
like a healthier creamer for your coffee
and then some stevia as a sweetener cuz
this is zero calories and it really
sweetens really well and then I also
take this fat-free ultra-filtered milk
and this milk is so good for you there's
more calcium more protein everything
like that so I just mix that and that's
my coffee and then going on to my actual
breakfast I made a parfait this is one
of my favorite go-to breakfasts it's so
yummy and so easy so I just take some
Greek non-fat yogurt from Trader Joe's I
just do some scoops of that and then
some granola this is like pumpkin flax
seed it's really good and then I am
putting some berries on that I love love
fruit so you can barely even see the
other stuff just because I love fruit
and then I'm putting some of this like
hemp seed and chia seed mix from Trader
Joe's as well because seeds are really
good for you so I just have this for
breakfast and it tastes really good and
yeah I love this
so then for lunch you guys might think
this looks weird a lot of my friends do
but it is so good guys I'm not even
joking so I take some spinach and then
some mixed greens some more mixed greens
I take carrots red bell peppers um one
of those those are snap peas just a
little bit of berries and then some
avocado some cranberries some nuts some
pear cuz it was just there and then I
also take this Thai veggie burger from
Trader Joe's this is so good it might
look weird but it's so good and then I
just put some fat free balls on my
vinaigrette and this tastes really good
as well but I love this salad I'm
someone who just like loves fruit and
vegetables and everything mixed together
I just think the sweetness and like
everything is just so good like
everything mixed so that was my lunch
and then moving on to my snack sometimes
I'll have more than one snack per day
but today my other meals were pretty
filling so this held me over and I was
also just really busy for my snack this
is also one of my favorite snacks
perfect for when I get home from school
even though it wasn't a school day I
just took this passion fruit tea and I
put some stevia in it as well to make it
sweeter this was also just cuz I was
tired and I wanted some caffeine and
then for my snack I just took some mixed
fruit and there's like pineapple in here
and plums melon like a ton of different
fruit and I just sprinkled some like
trail mix on top there's some dried
berries on that as well and that tastes
so good with the fruit like mixed I
don't know I absolutely loved that snack
so then for my dinner my mom made this I
didn't make this so creds to her but
there's some quinoa with some onions and
then some Swiss chard and then some
tomatoes some Sam
and some asparagus and this was so good
the salmon was like what was it was like
pumpkin honey mustard or something but
it was absolutely so good so that's what
I had for dinner and that's definitely a
really healthy dinner she's a really
good cook so it's healthy and yummy so
for dessert I went out with my family to
traditional Sunday night Froyo so I
couldn't show you guys but at this place
that we go they have an option for
stevia frozen yogurt which is like
frozen yogurt
but with deb√≠a so it's less calories so
like this entire thing is 56 calories I
think which is pretty crazy and I got
the flavor peanut butter and it was so
good so I had this for dessert it was
definitely an awesome way to finish my
day so thank you guys so much for
