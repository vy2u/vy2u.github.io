one canis was like boy Wow all right
round two
Mika this is definitely my first time
filming this video that was a lie
hello my beautiful best friend today's
video is going to be a sit-down we're
talking we're hanging I'm showing you
what I got for Christmas feel like I
haven't done a sit-down video or filmed
one at least and so long like I've done
intros for videos and things like that
but this is like me you we're hanging in
whatever Amaya focused my focus and if
you're new to my channel hello my name
is Val it is great to meet you thank you
so much for watching if you enjoy this
video you should subscribe down there
one of those we're almost in a million
what is life you guys are crazy I love
you I love you I can't I can't I think
that is a whole different video of
talking about that but and don't worry
some gifts are coming in the mail for
you guys right now so stay tuned this
video was so so requested on my blog
channel when I blogged like my last day
of August tears and you guys were like
now like please do what I got for
Christmas so that's what I'm doing today
that's what I do
what's up also yes I'm wearing hashtag
my Calvin's under this onesie because I
shared because it is very see-through so
you're welcome for saving your eyes I
didn't really ask for anything this
Christmas I mean I asked for couple
things so this was not expected like I
didn't even know if I was gonna do what
I got for Christmas cuz I wouldn't have
enough my family is just so sweet they
got me stuff that was not necessary but
they did so thank you I love you guys
and Santa shoutout to you but a couple
things before I start this video one I'm
not doing this video to brag in any way
shape or form I'm so blessed for thing
in my life I didn't even need anything
so this was so sweet yeah just no
bragging no bragging zone for me the
important part of Christmas is hanging
out with your family just sharing like
love and laughter and everything and
eating really good food and just I don't
know that's just what I value in
Christmas not the presents not the
objects I don't know you get what I'm
saying to be the deep cheesy one for a
sec I'll start with some makeup products
cuz that's like what I asked for
and I love makeup so so the first thing
is this Kat Von D contour kit I was so
excited for this because I've literally
using the same contour since I started
makeup to this day it's a lot of
bluffing or going like I've only used
like two contours probably my whole life
so it's time to just branch out you know
try something I don't know I've been
loving it all these things don't have
the like packaging on them because I've
already been using them this has been
raised about so much on YouTube and I
know why now then I got the modern
renaissance palette and this thing is so
raved about I was like okay well you're
gonna hop on the bandwagon your China
okay I can see why it's raved about
first of all the colors are gorgeous and
they're still like warm tone like really
good like the fall and winter time I'm
wearing it today I've been wearing it
the past couple of days and it just
blends so beautifully just so then the
next thing I asked for was this Smashbox
photo finish primer water I've been
trying to get a lot more - like trying
to protect my skin when I wear makeup so
I've been trying to find like more
primers and things to put but for I put
all the cake face on and this also just
helps it last all day it's kind of the
main point of it the next primer I got
why not use two primers better than one
right and this is the Porefessional by
benefit this like was raved about for
such a long time on YouTube and I just
never got it I was like no like I don't
need it whatever but I'm so happy I have
it now look right when you put this
stuff on onto your face like on tear
pores it just blurs the map like
instantly and you're just like where did
my pores go I don't know I've been
loving this past couple days cuz
Christmas couple days ago then I bought
myself this Too Faced better than sex
waterproof mascara just because this is
a gap is my favorite mascara I love it
so he's floating around I have the
waterproof and the non waterproof one
and I love them both but I was running
out of waterproof one so I got myself a
lot of prison Merry Christmas to me and
my right so then taking my best friend
Olivia's advice I got the a cosmetics CC
it cosmetics CC cream
this isn't light I don't know if they
have a shade lighter cuz I might need to
get back like a little dark for me too
so little maybe find something kidding
which is color correcting a full
coverage cream and it really is for like
a CC cream just has the coverage of a
foundation but it feels so much lighter
on your skin and I've been loving it so
Olivia you too girl you know your stuff
then also a recommendation by Olivia are
these Ardell wispy eyelashes
I'm in trying to get a lot more into
like wearing eyelashes and things like
that because I don't know I really
really love eyelashes and like the look
of them I just not the best at it I can
get a little better I got three of these
I wore one of them on Christmas but you
can we you can re weird I love it right
I don't know I loved them I'm excited
about them then I got this sugar
advanced therapy lip balm from fresh or
is it yeah I've just been trying to find
better chopsticks because my lips have
been dry from the wintertime really
needed some good chapstick and this is
really good it's pretty expensive for a
lip balm so I was hoping it would be
good but if you have any other good chap
sticks please let me know down below
because I'm in like a chapstick addict
so then I also asked for this and it's
so so cute I've been seeing this all
over Instagram and stuff this is from
Adina's Jules I believe yes and it might
be backwards is it backwards but it says
my name it says melody and it's just
like a gold choker and I also picked up
these two chokers from Target to wear
with it but it's like a very different
colored gold because this is probably
like more real than the target ones so
like they don't match that well but I'll
figure something out because I wanted to
like stack them layer them I love that
and that's like a good quality necklace
so that it lasts a long time
a nice little cute choker like that so
then I also asked for these shoes this
is not my most original not at all pair
of shoes because these are like very in
a lot of people have them and wear them
least in my area I've noticed maybe not
so much in other ways I don't know but I
really like them they're just a skate
high nope they're just the low with
skate vans in black and these are like
such good basic shoes to like wear with
anything really I have them in red but I
don't have just like the plain black
ones so I wanted those and my family
I've got it for me and then this I also
asked for because yes you know me I love
my hoodies I'm trying to cut myself off
I did just buy two more hoodies okay
okay okay but one was on sale the other
one I just really wanted but after that
I'm done I've got I'm glad that was just
Christmas present to myself but they're
coming to me right now so I'm not going
to show them in this video so this is
just a zip up and if there's food on it
I'm sorry
IH poli last night and being the really
neat eater I am I didn't get any of it
on my jacket it's a plain black hoodie
that says Thrasher but it's zip up which
I love it's size small but since it's an
or whatever it's like oversize which I
like because I like oversized things or
just come fear and I don't know so I got
that really happy about that so then my
mom got me this chi limited edition hair
straightener because I always use hers
and I think she's got to the point we're
like Mel just buy your own but I just
use her so she got me this I would
usually just buy like black in this but
I actually really like this color so
like good job mom I used it today and it
works really well and then she also
picked this out for me this is a laser
hair removal it's Bella flash by Silk'n
6 Silk'n yes just like a at home laser
hair removal which is very cool we don't
know if we're gonna end up keeping this
or not because when I was talking to the
girl who like I get waxed by she was
like laser hair removal might not work
great on you because you like blonde
hairs and like supposedly it's better
with dark hair
we don't know we're gonna do research
about it but this is still really
awesome if I end up being able to use it
then my mom's it's literally in a
plastic bag got me this lush it's lush a
bath bomb and this is just the like
galaxy one you know the one that's all
over tumblr and Pinterest and whatever
I've had this done before but it's
awesome it makes it look like you're
sitting in space so I'm good with it I
got some filet and I'm actually really
excited about this like you know you're
getting older when like you get excited
about like home good stuff and whatever
so they're just white flannel sheets and
this is gonna keep me warm in the winter
cuz their flannel
I don't then not did I only get one not
two not first but for coffee stuff
things so I got this Jamaican Blue
Mountain and like Jamaican coffee is so
good these are just coffee
I don't it's just like literally coffee
more coffee but it's like for my Keurig
my family's create actually but I just
I'm a very avid coffee drinker so this
is gonna be great I love it I also got
these two candles and they're like soy
wax candles because my mom is like
allergic to like something in a normal
candle so whenever I light a candle she
always gets mad at me and she like adds
up coughing her butt off and I feel bad
but like I would have a cute tumblr room
so she got me this pumpkin spice and
vanilla bean my rep mer mer mer my Roo
Oh God let me know down below I really I
don't know and these smell so good I
love candles this one kind of smells
like boy I need to chill smells nice
and this one just sounds like pumpkin
spice and me being the basic white girl
I like it so then my sister got me these
socks and they're from H&amp;amp;M and they're
like wool blend you can never have
enough socks and gonna be honest and
they're just like cute Christmas socks
so love these thanks sis she also got me
this notebook which I'm really actually
excited for and it's like a red leather
one with floral it's really cute and I
want to like start journaling more just
like keeping track of my thoughts maybe
like right for fun or like poetry or
anything I don't know so I'm really
excited about this for make even like
to-do lists or schedules having just
something like this is perfect you'll
see any USB that has two of her favorite
books on it I believe like audiobooks

really nice of her I'm excited to read
those and speaking of books I do want to
start I do ask I do want to start
reading more books because they're good
for you your brain and everything so I
asked for some books and my dad knowing

well so thank you Dad I love you so that
I believe is everything I got for
Christmas it's not like the craziest
stuff or whatever but I'm happy with it
I'm thankful for it I didn't need
anything at all so sweet of them the
best part was literally just hanging out
with my family the whole day and eating
