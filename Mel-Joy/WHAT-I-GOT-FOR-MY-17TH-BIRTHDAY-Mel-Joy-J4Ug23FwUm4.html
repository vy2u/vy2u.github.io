you did not see my last video then you
don't know that I just came out with a
jewelry line I'm so excited that I get
to share this with you guys I've been
holding it for so long funny enough I'm
not wearing it right now didn't match
enough but it is my signature necklace
that I wear all the time

orange red string so many of you guys
have been asking where you can buy this
they'll be linked down below I'm coming
out with more jewelry right now all we
have is my necklace on it but it's
coming out so stay tuned for that I'm so
excited and I can't wait for you guys to
see the other jewelry so really quickly
just wanted to say that in this video
just a disclaimer I'm not doing this
video to brag in any way shape or form
you guys I've been asking me to do this
like crazy so that's why I'm doing it
I'm so grateful for everyone who got me
a gift so sweet did you need anything so
it means a lot thank you to all of you
guys so if you weren't aware my birthday
was August 2nd and I turned 17 years old
one more year till I'm an adult so
pretty much I'm just going to show you
guys what I got for my birthday
I didn't ask really for like anything so
I wasn't expecting this without further
ado let's just get started the first
thing I'll do just because it's like
huge and I don't know how I'm gonna do
this is from my best friend Dre you guys
not dry shoes in my best friend tag it's
funny cuz I heard all my friends were
like arguing who was going to get me
this because I've always wanted this it
like everyone knows that it is a
life-size teddy bear they had
I don't know his or her name yet but I
asked you guys in my last video to
comment a name for him or her it's
amazing to just like cuddle with I know
that sounds sweet but like my name is
Frank and she also got me my favorite
flowers which were sunflowers I'm pretty
sure they're dead by now but she showed
up on my doorstep with like flowers in
the bear and I was like my heart so then
the next thing that I will show is just
the stuff that my parents got me because
my parents are my best friends and I
love them so I'll just show off my
biggest gift yeah I have been on these
bad boys for a while and I was out with
my mom knows like I really really want
them but I don't know if I should get
them but I and of course my mom and
didn't find it for me but they are
timberlands
yay okay they're not a box but they're
not just the normal orange like
timberlands and you know that color you
feel me they are the matte black
timberlands and they're so beautiful
every single things like the logo I'm
gonna wear these so much in the my
trainer was wearing them the other day
and it's in the summer like they're so
comfortable so supportive investors and
she bought them for me honestly she's
all about the footwear being supportive
thank you mom and dad I love you guys
these are amazing mo says oh goodness
that could be bad good job man the light
fell did the lighting change let's hope
no okay and then also my dad got me a
bike I've been wanting a bike for so
long just because I grew out all my old
bikes and like my friends always want to
go on bike rides and I'm like I don't
have a bike but now I do and I'm
obsessed with it it's so pretty it's
from public bike I'm not going to go get
it but I'm gonna insert some clips right
here public bikes is really cute buy so
I asked me what color I wanted and
there's so many cuccos I couldn't even
decide so I just picked this really like
light powder blue but I'm obsessed thank
you Dad
so much so my parents also got me some
miscellaneous things that I'm going to
show and I love so the first thing is
this Clooney plug dramatically different
moisturizing lotion I use a
one of this and I'm like pretty much out
of it I really wanted it oh I used this
lotion every morning and every night and
I'm running off so they got me this and
it comes with the big and the small one
also excuse my nails thanks guys the
next thing she got me is this concealer
and I have been eyeing this thing
because I used olivia's when I was in LA
I tried out hers and I loved it and it's
this Born This Way concealer in light
because I'm pale and then the next thing
that got me is an eye shadow palette and
I literally am running out of like good
eyeshadow palettes I don't know why my
eyeshadow is just like wet bad like is
that possible I've been looking for a
good eyeshadow palette and they got me
the Tarte that hard toilet bark pillow
palette it could be say that so wrong in
bloom so it's the second one not the all
matte one I've been using this thing
like I've been use it I've been using
this thing like crazy I'm obsessed with
it it has such pretty matte colors and
then like three shimmery colors I love
it it's so pretty and weirdly they smell
like chocolate it literally smells like
the Too Faced chocolate bar palette I'm
wearing right now if you're wondering
and I've been wearing it in the past
couple of my videos and they also got me
this perfume because the perfume I wear
everyday is running out it's from YSL
it's the black opium but this stuff
smells so good so I'm really happy about
this and then they also got me can we
take a moment it is the Becca champagne
pop highlighter yes yes yes I've been
eyeing this thing for so long but I use
the whole Nastasia block it I used a
blue glow kit I just like was always so
hesitant to like try a new one new
highlighter because I love that one so
much I got me this one and I'm wearing
it right now if you're wondering I'm
really happy they got me this so the
next thing they got me was featured in
my back to school athletes video and
it's just this cropped like nude hoodie
I think it's super cute it's super
comfortable it even has like thumb holes
which for some reason I really enjoy I
just like love little things like that
and then from brandy melville they got
me these sweats that these are the most
comfortable sweats this was also in my
back-to-school outfits video yeah
they're just a slight gray material and
they are so comfortable like I have the
white ones of these but these for some
reason are just
ten times more comfortable I don't know
why Thank You parents you know how much
I love sweat so then the next shirt
funny enough was also in my
back-to-school outfits but it's from
brandy melville dry Heather tank top OMG
what if I wore these what this was great
on Brett oh wow so yeah they got me this
tank top they also got me this lace up
shirt from Linden from brandy melville
or john galt
you know it's just like a olive army
green I love this it's just such a
pretty color and people tell me it
brings out my eyes because it do not
realize and I don't own really any
shirts like this so now you so the
experience and then the next thing I
will show is from my fellow YouTube
