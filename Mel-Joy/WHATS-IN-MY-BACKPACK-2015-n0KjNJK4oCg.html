where a nice semi no yeah we're in a
different location today I just felt
like a change you feel so before I start
this video I just wanted to say a quick
welcome to all my new studies I've been
getting quite a few of you recently but
I've not had a chance to talk to you
since after my last video so hey guys
welcome to my channel I hope you guys
enjoy my videos and everything I'm so
happy to have you guys so I just wanted
to also say thank you guys so much for
the support recently a chill has been
growing kind of fast it means a lot to
me I love you guys so much so much and
yeah today's video is going to be a
what's in my backpack for school if you
guys are wondering I am a sophomore this
year 10th grade I've started school
three weeks ago
that's when school resumed session for
me if you guys are still in summer I'm
envious of you I got a couple requests
to do this video so I was like okay I
got to do it now I'm being completely
honest like this is everything that's in
my bag like I didn't really clean my bag
out or like put things in food food
kisses what is it my backpack yeah I
don't know what I'll say I think we
should just get started so this is my
backpack
it is a North Face backpack it says the
North Face up there and it is a gray
color with mint blue turquoise detailing
yeah yeah yeah let's start in these
pockets these are probably the most used
pockets these are these two pockets down
the side there's so many pockets in this
backpack I don't even know how to keep
track of them in the right pocket the
first thing I have is a lip balm and
this is the Nivea lip butter I just put
this on whenever my lips are feeling
chapped this is in vanilla and macadamia
kiss and I like this a lot it really
moisturize my lips a second thing that
is in is this extra polar ice gum I
always gotta have some gum in my bag
because if your breath stings you have a
gross taste in your mouth
or you're just bored or wanna chew on
something this will always be there for
you so I just have this mint one the
next thing I have is some cash money not
nope click two bucks this is for the
vending machines on my school if I ever
get hungry like I bought cheez-its today
it's like two dollars because
everything's like 125 I also have some
tissues palace times I've been in class
needing a tissue and there isn't one and
I don't want to be like hey teacher can
I look at the tissue from the bathroom
so these are good to have so I have this
polysporin if he doesn't know he replies
born but you've heard of neosporin it's
pretty much the same thing this I
brought when I like this scab on my face
I got cut on my face and I had a scab
and it's gross so I was applying this to
make it go away and it's gone now I have
this for emergencies I guess my friend
used this the other day at school so I
mean it's coming in handy I also found
an expo marker but have this Expo marker
in black this is from last year it is my
drink daily something my mom put in my
bag I know what is something I'm going
to have this but it's like powder to put
in your drink so yeah that is everything
in the first pocket and then in this
pocket next to it I also have on almost
empty Frost icebreakers mormonthink
you guys will figure this out as you
continue watching this video but I tend
to have a lot of gum and mints usually
the things that I put in these two
pockets or things that I just want quick
access to that I use a lot in school and
things like that I have an empty duo
container see I told you guys so many
minutes I have but I can take this out
now then I enrolled in them I also
really like to share my mints and gum
like when I take it out and sounds like
kind of I'm not gonna be like no so I'm
like alright I don't know I just feel
like it's the nice thing to do I guess
and then the next thing I have is this
pencil and this is the pencil I've been
using recently it's a mechanical pencil
yeah this is just like the one that if I
need a pencil just whip it out and I use
it so that's why I have this in this
pocket so it's easy access I also have
some led in case that runs out and the
eraser things that go with it in case
that runs up also that's actually all I
have that one I feel like there'd be
more in there but there's not that's why
I keep in this and in the next small
pocket is right here and in here I have
more yum chakra trident tropical twist
cup we have a gum wrapper I have any
stick tacks this is the 200 path room
adventure it has four flips of thing
out of these so I need to restock I
share these too but when I give these to
friends they take like a whole handful
so they go live faster than gum does
that we got to work on wrappers wow
these are way now about this toe ring
put it on I was wearing at school and
then I'm sudden I felt something weird
and I was like what is that my toe ring
like what's going on
totally cracked in half so this is one
of the halves
oh yeah it's Daisy it was cute until it
broke in half and the last thing I have
in this small pocket is this pen and it
is a erasable pen and I really like
Reysol pens because if I mess up I can
erase it and I was using this more than
I was using my pencil but now I'm kind
of using Bo I have this there too if I
ever need that Oh hmm actually I forgot
one thing I lied not the last thing I
have my earbuds these are a necessity
for school whether I'm in work time and
I'm working or walking from class to
class and I have nothing else to be
doing but yeah your buds toasting to
music so that's everything in this small
pocket and this is also like I'm a
harder to it there's like aroma so I
guess you're supposed to like hold stuff
in there but I don't know my hair I feel
like my hair is uncontrollable recently
and I just don't know what to do about
it if I should just cut it off or if I
should just suck it up and do with it
we're going with the second approach as
you could tell so then in the first big
pocket there's like three big pockets I
guess it's not a big pocket but I mean
it's still pretty decently sized pocket
as you can see actually first I have to
undo these clips honestly this makes my
backpack looks so much smaller and I
really I really like that future in this
first pocket which is like lace that has
all this stuff at my business I thought
this was my schedule it's not my
studying thing that's the first thing I
have is a ruler I have a twisted ruler
and I found this since last year because
you know why buys you stuff when you
have your old stuff also that's another
reason I didn't do it back to school
supplies haul is because I ended up
using a lot of the stuff I had last year
and that I just idling around my house I
don't need to buy a whole new set of
binders and a whole new set of pencils
or pens if I already have them you feel
and then I'm pencil
just to have in the velcro pocket I have
my calculator my scientific calculator
for math this was required for this year
I have this protractor to do some math
with because this was required and then
I also have this compass because this
was also required for my math this year
so I got this I have this make a bag but
there's not makeup in it this is an Ipsy
bag so this is my pencil case just
because I can never find a cute pencil
case that's I don't know I I just used
to make a bag and this fits everything
perfectly it's the right size and
everything and in here I just have your
basic school supplies I got my
highlighters I got my sharpies I got my
colored pens and more color pens my
mechanical pencils are these green and
purple eraser things have you guys seen
these be like push them out like this
and then I push out erasers I get so
cool I love these I was just like play
with these in class in middle school but
now since I'm studious high schooler I
don't use these to play using the board
but I like these a lot
so yeah I just have all of my you know
tens pencils things that I could ever
end up needing in class so the next
thing I have is this other empty case I
am NOT sponsored by it see don't worry
it says their bags they're pretty good
for a backpack or so it's just a slight
one with this pink trimming and look
it's like color coordinate the first
thing I have is a hand sanitizer and
this is from Bath and Body Works and
this is the pink sugar plum you gotta
have hand sanitizer because school is a
dirty place you know there could be
sickness is going around and you want to
be the healthy one so that's why I have
this and then I also have a del
moisturizing cream this is some lotion
because I am doing ceramics this year
the clay dries out your hands so much
and then you like wash them and it gets
even more dried out I don't want my
hands to be dry not like that feeling I
have deodorant I'm going to be honest I
have left the house several times in the
past couple years without deodorant and
I just kept going I'm like oh no I
forgot the order I like text all my
friends you have you reducers I've
learned my lesson and I bring my own now
so this is the secret at last protecting
powder 48 hours but yeah I have a
full-size one just because I had an
extra one that I was thinking why bye
you know
small child size one if I have one
already I might invest in a travel size
one just if this starts taking up too
much room but I also might put this in
my PE locker I have this because you
don't want to be small at school and
then the next thing I have is this
mascara and this is the covergirl
LashBlast volume and a lot of the what's
in my backpack videos I see a lot of
beauty gurus have you know full set of
makeup powder everything and to be
honest I don't think I've ever realized
makeup at school except for lip products
occasionally but I don't even really do
that I just kinda use chapstick kind of
just never at the time unless we have
the swim unit which is in PE we swim I
have some waterproof stuff that I would
you know like reapply or put on after we
swam but I don't have to swim you know
right now so I don't really need that
but I do have this mascara just in case
I scare as always necessity
I guess so then I have two hair ties
these are my favorite eyes I love the
cloth hair ties so that is everything
that I have in this little bag this is
like you know more my beauty stuff
cosmetic type things the next thing I
have in this pocket is nothing I don't
have it in this pocket here I have all
my definite things if you're a girl at
school and your new stuff hit me up I
got you it's that time a month or maybe
that time a month surprises you you will
be prepared clothes everything they have
in this pocket
so then into the biggest pocket I have I
have my lunch from today the remains of
that freshman year and middle school and
everything like that
I had so many managers I'll have a
binder for each class out of like seven
binders and that just put way too much
weight on my back pal this year I did
two binders but I did bigger ones
so the first binder looks like this and
it's just a white binder and I'm
planning to cover it in stickers but
right now I may have one it's a brandy
Melville sticker just californ there's a
surfer on it cool but in here I have
three subjects have ceramics s so
actually I have two my life I only have
ceramics an ASL knit ASL sign language
by the way when I have this black one
this is a two inch binder the other one
I think is an inch and a half and just
has the brandy melville also California
Los Angeles sticker on it and a plain
air cover this one too I have history
chemistry geometry in English this is my
my main binder it's because I have
certain days where I have all of these
classes or all of these classes so I
only have to bring one of the minder
some days or this one and this one or
both I like this way so much better than
having like seven binders so that's all
that I keep in my big one in this back
pocket which can also be used for your
laptop if I ever bring my laptop to
school I put in here because it's like a
laptop sleeve I have my planner um I am
definitely wanting to cover this in
stickers they did not have like any
other colors but it's just my planner
you know to organize my week my day I
just can't put my homework I put my
YouTube schedule on here and my school
schedule and my basketball schedule so I
can just look in here and see what I
have to do every day for everything keep
that back here that's pretty much all I
keep back here I have my schedule also
if you actually keep my water bottle I
don't know where it's at but I have a
purple camera back in this pug it was
like a little hidden pocket I keep a
body mist thing I have the pink with a
splash sweet and flirty body mist I use
a rollerball everyday like for my
everyday perfume and I would definitely
bring that except them scared that it's
gonna break because it's glass so that's
why I bring this even though it's a
different scent yeah I'm pretty sure
that's everything I keep in my backpack
