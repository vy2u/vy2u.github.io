know I I tried on at least 20 shades of
lipstick to me we're going with this huh
you guys like my cookie shells hey guys
it's me Mel and today's video is going
to be a really a very suggested video I
feel like I've been saying that in all
my videos recently but it's because I'm
trying to do videos what you guys want
to see so today's video is going to be a
what's in my purse so you're gonna get
to find out what some of first chair
won't stop spinning it was in my cart or
a lot of you guys asked to see to my
cart or I don't even remember my last
video oh is in my haul and I also did a
Twitter poll if you guys don't follow me
on Twitter you should because that's
where I talk to you guys a lot about
what videos I'm gonna fail know what you
guys want to see and all that stuff and
I try to respond to a lot of you guys
how my twitter is Melander squared over
three wise I was show as simple and
there was only one line but it was taken
so whoever has that username jealous I
asked you guys for videos and this one
got the most votes so I'm doing it this
is my purse oh I just noticed I'm
wearing like what's the word they're
like different shades that's bad know
what whatever will do it zips at the
front like so but like folds over a
pocket in the back right here it has
this cute little like keychain says
Bible pores on it and the detailing is
silver and there's the dark brown or
dark brown or black detailing on it and
the inside is just like nude ish page
and says m'kay on it
and I like it a lot and I think it looks
you with like the ballet pink nudie
first color this strap looks like this
so this is whoa it's like this long and
you can put it on these little rings
there's one here and there's one here
and then it becomes a crossbody bag I
like it just better like this just
because it's kind of a little big to be
a crossbody bag for me at least for like
my height it just looks a little funny
but you know I'll probably do it anyway
kiss whatever and if you're wondering I
got this purse at Macy's through Ebates
I got this for such a good deal guys
because it was on sale then 25% off for
another sale and then I got 5% cash back
I think maybe it was six it was some
percent of cash
act I got more of my back so you know
what I was pleased with this price do
you guys want to sign up for you Bates
to get cash back on your purchases
online I talked about it in my last haul
if you want to watch that to see but you
can click the link down below sign up
it's all Gucci you'll get some money
back or just saving money by buying
stuff like but just a disclaimer I'm not
trying to brag in any way you guys
really wanted to see what was in my
purse and the details about it so I'm
doing this video for you guys so I have
the tag still we recently bought it is
the Michael Kors Selby purse and in the
color ballet which I love the name it so
cute and it is the medium satchel and
it's usually three hundred and fifty
eight dollars but I got it on sale I got
save like 130 150 and I'm real with you
guys until you guys the prices and all
that stuff because I want you guys to
know in case you want it or something
this video guys is like a hundred
percent real I didn't put anything in my
purse for this video this is everything
is in my purse the first thing let's see
what do I see we got my wallet this is
my Kate Spade wallet my friend aundrea
who's at my best friend tag office for
me for my birthday very sweet of her I
got all my stuff my driver's license Oh
bad guys it was when my eyebrows were
barely there we got some gift cards you
know just my info you know what I also
have my grandma gave me this it says
melody and then it's just joyful life
therefore with joy shall you draw water
out of wells of salvation which is from
Isaiah 12.3 I'm not like strictly
Catholic or anything but my grandma gave
this to me and I think it's funny cuz my
middle name is joy and it says melody
joyful life like what I thought was cute
it's good to have a wallet but then the
next thing I have our sunglasses these
are my Ray Ban sunglasses I have a black
and brown case the guy gave me both like
how cool is that I was like I don't know
what I want he's like UFO I was like
boss thanks dude but they're that good
they're just the brown aviators I
honestly don't know the style of it they
look like this they're the polarized
ones I want the all black aviators still
some so cool just sunglasses are good to
have to protect your eyeballs so these
are
most of the next thing I see I actually
don't know whence is in here - lint
roller so you can see that this purse
can hold decent sized things I usually
don't have liberal in my purse it was
because I went to a birthday dinner last
time I took my purse out and someone
asked me to bring them a lint roller so
that's what I did I brought it for them
I probably take this out of my first
just cos take sample the next thing here
which is definitely a must
are my car keys this is just my Michael
Kors keychain I wish I could like put it
on the side like this it's gold
detailing and this is silver detailing
and I love too much pink I don't know I
figured I don't uh I was gonna buy like
a black one we still read you tailing to
put on it what do you guys think do you
think I'd be cuter I should just keep it
plain and then have this comment down
below I actually like what that pink
from you guys cuz I don't know what to
do and this is just my Jeep my baby and
I have bees because I need to get places
and I need my keys to start my car and
then the next thing I have a whistle
wait if you're ever in an emergency and
it's silver detailing you know what I
could put that as a keychain the next
thing I have is a portable charger but
me being me this is really pointless
right now because this is the charger
for it I need to actually have a
charging cable to be able to charge my
phone on the go so I should really
didn't get one because they only have
one it's like six feet and I don't want
to carry it around
I'll probably get like you know one of
those three dollar ones so that will
probably be in my purse won't play soon
because this is good to have in case
your phone guys this is just the Ramos
premium charger it was like 10 bucks
it's good do I have a lot of gum and
mints so I have my favorite which is the
sweet mint by orbit and then I have this
Eclipse polarized I'll sort of like this
one too and then I have Mentos now mints
winter drew that's problem my favorite
my degree and I usually have a free gum
in here but I finished it and didn't buy
new and I'll probably end up doing that
just cuz I like to have a different
variety and then the next thing is a
chapstick
this is my iOS summer fruit to traffic
also excuse my nails I need to
them done the Balch and summer fruit
cousin you know getting ready for summer
but I like this a lot it tastes good it
makes my lips feel nice and then the
next thing I have is a lip gloss usually
just carry around what I have on my lips
that day
and this was the last thing I had on my
lips ooh and I took my breath out so I
could touch it up later and on the go
and stuff but I have this all night
LM a lip gloss these are really nice I
really like them it's almost like
chapstick like it's so buttery and nice
and this is just like a pale pink and
then another thing I have this is a
little weird don't judge me but it is a
protein bar but it's open and half-eaten
cute mo cuz I take protein bars on the
go for a snack in case I'm out and I'm
hungry in it and I'm somewhere where
there's no food I don't know you never
know I guess it came in handy cause it's
happy I have some ear buds and I am
someone who can walk out the door and
forget your butt so easily so I like to
happen in places that will already be
there so like I'll know that they're
there and I don't have to like grab them
on my way out so I just have some ear
buds
I got receipts I got a lot of receipts
when I buy things I'll just put the
receipts in my bag we got some yogurt
receipts some dinner the same thing
glace more yogurt oh and then another
thing I keep in my purse
is pretty self-explanatory but it's my
phone this is my iPhone 6 in gold just
got a clear case on it you guys also
wanted to see what's on my iPhone video
that was on the Twitter poll but it
didn't win it got second place if you
guys want to see that video thumbs up
this video or comment down below yeah
and then the last thing are these brown
oil blotting paper sheets I got these at
generation Beauty they were giving them
out these are nice for when you're out
and you're oily but don't want to kick
up your face more with face products
which I really don't like doing so I got
these babies and they work really well I
love oil blotting sheets it's always
gross to see how much oils on your face
like when you do it and then we got the
little thing I showed you guys at them
and that's actually all I keep in my
purse it's not super exciting I don't
keep a lot of stuff in my purse if I'm
going somewhere and I bring my purse and
I'm not bringing my car most of the
times when I go out you know I Drive so
I bring my car and that has like lotion
and perfume and stuff in it
so if I am going to
without my car out put that stuff in my
purse is for emergencies whatever so a
lot of the stuff that I keep in my car
will be my purse if I don't take my car
with me so if you guys want to see
what's my car video I have that on my
channel and that is everything I keep in
my purse I hope you guys like this video

wanted to get it out for all you people
