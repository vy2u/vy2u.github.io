honestly so we're just gonna start with
my wallet kid speed wallet that my
friend gave me for like my 16th birthday
I think this has been in my life for
like a good two years it's done me well
I like it has so much stuff in here like
it's a little over crowded but it's okay
and this is everything in this pocket by
the way we're doing a big pocket first
what I love about this too is that
there's so many pockets if you can hide
so many things and then the next thing
are my sunnies I'm obsessed with these
bad boys I say bad boys way too much I'm
trying to like clean them because I'm
gross and they're dirty but I'll put
them on feet they look like this
and I'm obsessed so cute they're from
white fox can use my coat for a
percentage of down below they're from

fold and oh my gosh that's cool like
they're from the brand key that's how
you guys who makes it then your girl got
her car keys once again I have a
microporous football there was a time
when I was obsessed with these things
but I bought it a long time ago just
half white pink / red maroon ish I don't
know I'm into it I got my Jeep my baby
my love you want to see my Kart or you
can go see that so much in self-promote
but then my Hollywood
keychain thing because I'm basic and I
love it even though I don't live there
got that I have a portable charger
because my phone guys way too often I
have the charger with it but not a
charger oh it's plugged in my computer

cuckoo I can be sing a song I'm starting
four treatments but I love these
chargers I have so many of them and you

today but yeah I got my phone it's the
black not even black it's the Space Gray
6s plus if you want to seem someone
iPhone that's also my channel this is
literally just like a self problem for
all my other videos so then the next
thing I have on my CVS oil blotting
sheets I also have my elf wings like
occasionally like I'll switch amount or
whatever it instantly removes oil and it
won't smudge your makeup this is good
for when I get really oily what I love
about this is when you like open it it
like whips one out for you because it's
like sticky on that side so you know
it's just so helpful oops I shouldn't
have done that well it's okay okay so
that's great for when I get oily which I
do not fun then I have gone if you know
me I'm a gum addict addict I have a gum
at it I'm a gum addict so the first gum
I have in here is these ice breakers ice
cubes tropical freeze my friends are all
obsessed with these whenever I have
these it's just like everyone helps
themselves so just okay they're so good
and then I also have my favorite mint
gum which is the orbit sweet mint to
sound like too overpowering cuz I'm not
into that but it's like it's good it's
good I'm saying and then the next mint
type of thing I have is these ice
breaker duos and if you have not tried
these you're missing out you are
hardcore may stink apps stuff is so good
this is a watermelon one they like
raspberry and draw berry and everything
I like the watermelon one but pretty
much it's like some mint on one side and
then like fruity on the other side and I
know you might be like oh that's gross
what but it's so good like I don't even
know there yeah I always just want to
have a nice money breath you know when
I'm talking to someone I'm like oh my
god I hold my breath oh it's okay right
now and then I have a chapstick I
literally throw whatever chapstick I
have near
in my bag I just really love chopsticks
I make sure to have one this is just
like this chopstick duo and you can like
add another one on one end as a peach
one this smells so good god I love
chapstick I have this Pink Sugar Plum
pocket vanta bacterial hand gel this is
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
it's the perfect winter man sanitizer
because it's pink sugarplum you know it
smells really good
if you want to keep your hands clean and
all that jazz I got this bad boy then
for perfume I have this YSL black opium
perfume this stuff smells so crazy good
oh my god I'm obsessed I don't do spurts
right now and this is just when I want
to slug it which is always so you know
and I have a gum wrapper typical Eddy
poori with the shot okay I tried then in
this pocket rat hair I have first of all
I literally haven't like taken anything
on my bag like the last time I went out
I just kept everything in I just fit
myself but I have this choker it's just
a maroon choker really cute like
burgundy beads from choke me jewelry
which I have a coupon code why do I not
know any my coupon codes I'll put it
right here and down below and you get
20% off your order and their chokers are
so adorable I'm wearing two of them
right now so I have that I'm obsessed
with chokers I think in the past like
five of my videos I've been wearing
chokers so then I have to look colors
I'll usually have whatever lip colors
I'm wearing that day these have been my
favorite so the colour-pop lippie Stix
and skimpy and it's glossy and then the
colour-pop ultra glossy lip and fairy
floss and it's just new I've been really
into nude lips recently I'm ELISA Mona
but I like to have whatever lip color
I'm wearing that day and that's what
eyes are my lipstick I have a hair tie
it's just like a pink hair tart I have
two more gum wrappers put those in the
thin even mix trash can I have my house
key that's a good thing to have then I
have three bobby pins
interesting number of bobby pins to have
should probably like get more put him in
like a key container something but I
just have three probably cuz I was bring
them in my hair and I took him out or
something but that's also good to have
if your hair is not cooperating because
my never cooperates with me and then I
have a spoolie it's just like a pink
spoolie and this is to brush out your
brows I'm sorry if my brows that kind of
rough I like have not had the time or
energy to like actually sit down and do
them and you guys know I'm too scared to
get them done because I do them myself
and it takes so much time
I need to do that um so stick with me on
my brows sorry for that situation Oh
another bobby pin all right and then I
have these CVS lubricant eyedrops and I
know you're like you what lubricant eye
drops but this is for mild to moderate
dry eyes if you guys didn't know I don't
blink all the way I went to the eye
doctor and they're like hey you have
really crazily dry eyes because you
don't blink all the way I'm like what
when I blink I like don't shut my eyes
Lou and I just like half blink or
something so my eyes really crazily
always really dry and to really find his
my Isaac really read half the time and
it's really annoying
if you're looking for like dear Eddie's
izing that is not a word eyedrops that
make your eyes not read like this is me
this is not it if you catch my drift
don't worry this is just for really dry
eyes because I really dry eyes also when
I put on makeup Alan don't shut my eyes
because I'm just really focused and I
think that really makes it worse and
also just wearing eye makeup like
whenever I wear eye makeup my eyes get
so dry and it's really annoying so I'm
trying to figure that out also when I
Slade I said I probably like sleep like
this like with my eyes open which like
kind of creeps me out that also leads to
having dry eyes so shout-out to my eyes
but I have these my doctor told my mom
about these and she gave me so it's a
good time we got some lubricant I drop
and I will also probably have like some
sort of water or water bottle with me
for example probably something about
this size because I am addicted to
drinking water it is really bad I'm
actually over hydrated like perhaps like
what I know that sounds weird but I
honestly like I was I will probably have
some sort of order maybe and I think
that is it I thought it'd be a little
bit more of an foam but that is
everything in my purse slash backpack
that's the real backpack of me if you
