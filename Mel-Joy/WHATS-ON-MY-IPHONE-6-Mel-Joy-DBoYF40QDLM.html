like that chill ponytail luck today how
did I lose Viking okay hey guys it's me
Mel so today's video is going to be a
video that you guys have been asking me
to do like crazy
it is a what's on my a poem if you are
new to my channel and not subscribed you
can definitely do that it's free I post
videos every single Saturday so if you
want to do that little subscribe button
is right there so anyway and go back to
the video you guys have all really been
wanting to see a what's my iPhone video
or most of you I think you guys have
been commenting like crazy to do one of
these videos that's what I'm doing today
my last what's on my iPhone video was I
think over a year ago and it was when I
had a completely different phone
different model different everything
yeah that's order today I have the
iPhone 6 in gold I just have a clear
case on it right now it's just like a
jelly case I like having clear cases on
it because I like the color yeah
sometimes I put stickers on it I
actually just took one off today because
it was getting like really old you know
stickers get old no I just have it in
white gold there's no black gold so
that's pretty okay we're just going to
turn my phone on airplane mode for this
video so I don't get notifications that
distract us oh my by my hair today the
first thing you see when you turn on my
phone is my lock screen this is just a
picture that I took and I love it I
don't know the world is so pretty so I
just put this as my lock screen because
I really like nature so yeah and then my
background is just a picture of the
beach because once again with the nature
and if you guys know I love the beach I
talk about the beach all the time the
first thing this is my I guess homepage
right yeah the first thing is camera and
then I have my photos if so many photos
about 12,000 photos so I take a lot of
photos and then I am a calendar I have
my weather I check the weather all times
so I can see what to wear our my Safari
my mail I have a lot of unread
now and then I might after work FaceTime
note settings clog if you guys want to
see how many alarms I have I have a lot
of alarms I have ways which is how I get
places this is like my maps directions
it like tells you the shortest amount of
time it warns you if there's I got a
hole in the road or if there's a car
stop somewhere it's really helpful I'm
really really terrible at directions if
you guys have ever driven with me which
you probably have it I stuck at
directions so this comes in a lot of
comes in a lot of use I have my favorite
apps because it's my home page and this
is all the things that I go to the most
so the first thing is my Instagram we're
gonna show you a better plan well first
step if you guys want to follow me it's
Mel underscore joy with three wise you
can definitely do that
and see the photos I post yeah yeah
cool all right so that's my Instagram I
want us to grow a lot I love Instagram
you know it's a cool place I have my
Instagram notifications on so I can you
know stalk you guys see if you guys are
liking my photos if you tagged me in a
photo if anything like that that's why I
have it on there primer for the video
and then the second app is Twitter I
love Twitter Twitter is probably my
favorite social medias because I feel
like I can talk to you guys the easiest
on that so I definitely try to talk to
you guys as much as possible or retweet
your tweets out and respond to them
things like that so my twitter is also
metal on dashboard wrong with three wise
earlier she was simpler and I didn't
have to put the three wise but all the
other ones were taken so you know what
we're dealing so this is my Twitter if
you want to follow me on that you can
this is my snapchat I love snapchat I'm
all set out all the time you just want
to see what story consists of yeah story
who if you guys only have like a clique
in fiction if you guys want to follow me
on that says right here it is me myself
to melt two L's once again the amount of
letters that I have to put to get a
username available you know it's just a
struggle but it it's good I don't know
if it'll let you like take a photo of
the screen right now like if you take a
photo of the screen right now
and then you can add me maybe let me
know if it works comment down below the
next thing I have is tumblr I love
tumblr tumblr is like perfect for you
just playing a big listen mutual music
or in the bath or just like totally
relaxing to my tumblr is me myself in
mouth to else as well and then my
favorite folder is too if you don't get
it it's YouTube I have YouTube the app I
have YouTube studio which is pretty much
lets me kind of edit my videos and
manage more of my videos huge Anja
commenting that's more for like creators
if you guys post YouTube videos I
definitely suggest getting that I love
it YouTube capture next thing is vsco
cam I use that to edit my photos if you
guys want to see how I edit my Instagram
photos let me know down below or like
this video and I can do that I'm not
going to talk about it in this video
because I feel like it'll be too long
and I don't want it to be too long and
then the next app is health I use health
see how many steps I walked or to track
my weight or to track my Heights a nice
free app to track your health so I enjoy
this app and that's why I have it on
front screen and then lastly sturby exit
I love Starbucks it's even Starbucks I
think this app is really cool because
you can just like pay like I don't have
to bring a way to pay I can just use my
phone I have my card connect it to the
app and then you can also order to a
straw bucks location so I'd be like I
want to order this and then I can go
feed up which is really convenient
especially for school and things like
that so I have that and then the three
on the bottom are phone because you know
call people messages to tax people and
Spotify I am almost always on Spotify I
absolutely love Spotify if you guys
follow me on Spotify then you can see
like my little thing of what I'm
listening to and it'll probably be going
almost 100 of the time because I love
music I have a ton of playlists on here
my name is me myself ml with two L's
this is my Spotify if you guys want to
follow it you can see all my music I
pose for when I'm working out for when
I'm just chillin my favorites things
like that so yeah if you want to see
what I'm listening to and all the music
I've been loving you should definitely
follow me on there I just have snap
checked on there but I kind of liked it
with other social media your feelings on
my second page all they have two pages
my home page in this page I got my
fitness this is the first folder
formerly don't use any of these I'm
going to be honest except for the walk
free one to like track how much I run if
I ever go running and then I have future
living spark recipes those are just like
healthy recipes workout apps I give you
ideas if I'm ever stuck on what we're
going to do or what to eat and then I
have text apps I also don't use anything
any of these either but I have telegram
whatsapp Facebook Messenger touch pala
characters and ubu telegram and what's
up I mainly some middle schools so and
then touch houses like on your keyboard
you can like draw the words out and then
it will go on your keyboard that makes
sense not leaves it either that
characters which is like the emojis but
like not the cartoon you get me you get
me maybe and then I have AVO if I
everyone at twelve way FaceTime the
friends or something and then I have
photography the only app that I pretty
much use in this folder it sounds so bad
it sounds like I don't use any of my
apps but I have afterlight that's the
app that I use the most I use that along
with this go canvas like my two main
editing apps but then these other apps
are just like things that I'll like one
effect or like one one something or
other so then the next folder I have is
food and travel I have post mates
because if I ever want to drive
somewhere you know really lazy I don't
know post pizzas you know it's great you
can get food delivered and then I've
yelled because I've actually been using
Yelp a lot recently
just look up reviews and stuff I've
actually really been liking that and
then I have around me which is a app
that helps you find things around you I
use this a lot on road trips and stuff
because you don't really know where you
are
you're not really familiar with the
place and I use this a lot to find yo-yo
places is said I of Caltrain if I ever
want to take the train somewhere I'll
note schedules and then over because
over everywhere I'm sure and I have
etcetera this is just like the stuff
that that iPhone comes with it's like
the iMovie GarageBand all that good
stuff and then I've yo which is kind of
the same as the first folder I don't
know why they're not together or why I
named it yo and why does my phone say
its name what do you want a.m. it's not
nothing what's going on with my phone
right now and I have games I don't
really play games on my phone if you
watched one of my favorites video you
know my company Andy so I've candy crush
Sims waterslide Kendall Kylie and color
five and this is actually a lot of fun
this is one of the things I made it's
like a coloring book but on the phone I
don't know I have fun with this
I haven't you just in a while but who
knows maybe I will and then I have
utilities just more stuff the iPhone
comes with but I have word web that's
something that the phone doesn't come
with and that to look upwards if I ever
wanted to find a word I have social
these are like the social apps that I
don't use as much because the social
apps that I use more are on first page
and Netflix really isn't a social app
but I love Netflix so you know maybe
that's why I think if you guys want to
follow my Poshmark it's me myself and
Mel if I ever sell leave my clothes or
anything on there you know maybe you
could you could buy one or something and
then I have work there's two hours cause
it's supposed to be like where's my hair

on your phone no cards and then Chrome I
have shopping on they have three things

these on my phone but Amazon is
definitely a popular one for me at least
and then I've personal I'm my bank
headspace which is something my dad
showed me it's like meditation but I
haven't used a while but yeah maybe I
will and I find my friends you know so I
can stop my friends real fun no I'm just
kidding me my friends just use that I
don't know I don't know why but we do
and then I find my iPhone because you
know that's important if I lose my phone
I have to find somehow I don't even know
if that's what good I should really
issue a check and then I have download
because I can
