one I'll sit when you open my phone I
have my parents as my background because
they are my best friends and my homies
and I look up to them so much but this
is just a photo of them in a newspaper
that they were in because they like
volunteered for like some organization
that helped foster kids like it was an
amazing organization love my parents my
heroes and then when you log into my
phone this is just my background just a
picture I took on snapchat in Vancouver

interesting things these are like my
favorite apps that's why they're on my
homepage I have ways because I suck at
directions so when I Drive pretty much

will be using way so then I have
Instagram gotta love it

Twitter then snapchat now my snap squad
LFO we've little league names you guys
know I love snapchat I'm on snapchat all
the time it's kind of weird
I'm like we're gonna myself in 3
different places so yeah this is my
snapchat love using my favorite filters
like
this one I mean I hope they never take
it away
really I have snap qna is using metric
yeah I post on my story a lot I love
snapchat who doesn't honestly cuz spend
forever just watching stories they're
like little mini reality TV shows and
then I have tumblr I love tumblr I feel
like I don't talk about tumblr that much
but my account is me myself a melon with
two L's and like I always get makeup
inspiration from there just cute little
photos just like I love tumblr tumblr is
like tumblers always got my back when
I'm in a bad mood I'll just go on tumblr
just like also talked to you guys on
Twitter whenever I'm like in a bad mood
I just like just talk to you guys on
Twitter cuz you guys trim you then I
have to but which is you do we gotta
love it
technical difficulties I realize we're
never returned my phone sideways it
would stop recording don't turn your
phone so I've YouTube because yeah and
then I have studio if you're a creator
on YouTube I would really suggest
getting studio you can see like recent
comments I love looking at your comments
that way responding to comments and then
I have YouTube captured just in case I
need to real quick upload something
YouTube I don't know I've never really
used it but who knows maybe one day so
then I have photo I don't really even
use photo if you guys have heard of it
it's like just many like gifts my
friends use it so I downloaded it I
don't really do much with it then I have
vsco cam which is how I edit my photos
and now let's get into that editing so
pretty much when you open my vsco cam it
looks like this you can see like
Instagram feed even though I really
don't really care about my theme and
feed I just kind of post what I want
it's good for if you care about that so
I'll just take a photo with most
subscribers because you guys are my life
I love you guys this was me and
Vancouver with your subscribers these
girls were so sweet I loved them in
which the filter I use in almost every
single one my photos is a six I don't
know why but I never do like full full
effects if that makes sense I'll do like
six five three eight nine it just it
depends the photos I get like six for
this one and then sometimes that'll
lighten the photo too much so I'll put
it down one notch I don't really think
I'm gonna do that for this photo
sometimes this effect turns the photo
like more warm tones so sometimes I like
to make it cool tones by using
temperature and like putting it down one
but that's a little too much for this
photo
sometimes I'll turn the saturation down
if it
right or sometimes even up if it's too
dark sometimes highlights too like if my
face looks too late or you see like back
there how it's really white like if I
want to tone that down a little bit I'll
do a little bit I'll just do that like
twice yeah I like how you can like zoom
on it sometimes I'll do contrast and
I'll bring a contrast higher or lower
but I like this how it is so obviously
that some of the other effects that I
have used are a 5 but I never do from
you know full thing or HB 1 or HB - I
like both of those - a lot I've used p5
like really low I think like once like I
don't I don't even know for black and
white I'll use B 1 or B 5 but I'll turn
it down because it like makes it really
dark I'm literally like the most basic
Instagram photo I don't get like a face
tune and make sure everything looks good
like I'm so about like real instagrams
like I try not to do a lot of effects
your a lot of anything is like hey like
this is literally me like see that
pimple I got a pimple I'm not gonna like
facetune and outs I don't really have
that many apps for like that case so if
you're looking for that I'm sorry I
don't really have a lot of apps like
that but the next app that I use
sometimes is also after light and what
I'll do on after light because on vsco
cam it'll make you do it like notches
and sometimes one notch is too like
dramatic if I want the brightness a
little lower I'll do like you know
smaller or sometimes I do exposure you
know and that just like turns it out a
little bit but on a lot and also
temperature too because sometimes a
temperature on visco is like too strong
you know I'm saying after light is one
dollar but vsco cam is free and I love
both of these apps the very dope and
good to use for edit and sometimes if
I'm feeling arty I'll put some grain on
a photo that's mostly for like photo
that like was taken professionally you
know I'm saying like with a good camera
so that's pretty much right and my entry
remote oh is so simple I don't do a lot
of fancy stuff I keep it chilled then
the next thing I have is health such a
cool free app because you get it like
with your phone I just realized I wasn't
recording my screen at all
I have one job I like to track my steps
in health sometimes occasionally I'll
check in and be like hey my like walking
around in it also my weight when I weigh
myself I use this to track my weight and
make sure that I'm not going whoop or
you know saying and then I have to
Starbucks you place an order on your
phone and then pick it up was just so
cool and then you can also pay you just
hold it up to the scanner and then
you're good and it's just like it's just
very a sword convenient there you go so
then on this page I'm not gonna go too
in depth with these because I really
don't use a lot of these pretty much
just my homepage on fitness I just have
some free apps like little workout or
like healthy recipe ones walk free is
how I track how much I run when I go
running and then photography I have
these apps I really want to use any of
them
the only one that I would say is editing
is this one and this can you can just do
like cool effects it kind of creeps me
out sometimes you can do weird stuff
like yeah and like I don't know
kickstart I think is a collage up I
could be so wrong I really like don't
use these apps that I have them I should
probably leave him oh and then personal
I just have a space which is like a
relaxing thing that my dad let me get a
while ago and then I find my friends
who's me my friends stalk each other
asking and then find my iPhone download
which is how I manage my app venmo for
me to be my friends and for them to pay
me and I have Mel joy what which is my
app and if you're like what Mel you've
enough you didn't tell people like I did
a while ago but I don't like use it that
often I'm gonna really like focus on it
soon and like try to make it actually
really cool let's show you a little bit
it's pretty much just like you can
browse through my videos and stuff like
keep up with my tumblr see all my posts
or Instagram pretty much how to keep up
with me I want to do like actual blog
posts and like exclusive stuff so you
should download that to see those coming
because hopefully I figure out how to
get those up soon so yeah then I have a
daily horoscope cuz I should be show on
that I would literally check it every
day and be like is this right like is it
right and half the time I was right and
it creeped me out but I'm a Leo if
you're Leo liked this video because Leo
squad
what's up and I have contacts cuz I
don't wanna use contacts and I have clue
because just want to keep up with my
cycle
yes it's my period ass I actually find
it really cool because it will literally
like notify me be like hey you your
things happen and soon and you're just
like like it's very convenient
in that sense and then on the second
page I just have Netflix I don't know
why that's been personal but Netflix and
then I have food and travel I just have
Yelp I literally just like use it to
like look up reviews of places around me
