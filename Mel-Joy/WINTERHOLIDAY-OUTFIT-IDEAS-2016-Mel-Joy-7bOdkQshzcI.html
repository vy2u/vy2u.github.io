to incorporate some outfits I can wear
like holiday parties and like out with
your friends and like fancier occasions
that might not be like school
appropriate but also I'm not really
using my hands right now but I also
incorporated some like chiller outfits
that you could wear to school and not
get dressed coded and just to chill or

laid-back holidays outfit so I tried to
incorporate as many styles as I could um
