I love snapchat I want such a lot so you
can add me right here it's me myself and
Mel with two L's
don't forget the two L's I know a lot of
people do but it's just because
usernames were taken and I just had to
work with the two L's
I love snapchat and I love getting
serious faces in the least creepy way
possible so also if you guys notice my
lighting is different I just got some
new lighting so I'm trying to experiment
with it if it looks a let me know if it
looks better let me know um it might
take a couple times for me to get it
right but I hope it looks good I don't

sucker for salads there's so many
different type of salads I just find
them so good so either salads or Mexican
food because I love Mexican food
- like start YouTube and when did you
start it and what have you learned from
it okay I love discussion I started it
about two years ago yeah exactly like
almost years ago in the summer going
into ninth grade but I took like a break
right when I went into high school just
because I was really busy with school
and it was a new school I didn't know
anyone so I took a break but then I went
back to it and I started posting
consistently I have always wanted a
YouTube channel if you guys watch my
other videos you know that I've been
making little videos in my room since I
was like 8 or 9 I have them I might do a
reaction video if you guys want to see
them I don't know I was watching the
other day I was like what I've been
making video stills really young like in
my robe in my room I never posted them
so then I did just decided I was going
to new school I didn't know anyone was
kind of like a fresh start
it was definitely hands-down one of the
best decisions I've ever made and why I
started it because I'm so passionate for
videography and for beauty and fashion
does everything I loved
like combined into one and I was like
yes and stuff I've learned from it I've
learned who I learned a lot from YouTube
which I'm so grateful for I've learned
to be myself and not care what other
people think of me so a lot of like
confidence stuff I've learned to manage
my time so much better like then I used
to I used to be terrible at managing my
time but I'm so much better at it which
like thank you you do and I've also
learned like priorities you know and
like what's important to you and what
you should put first and things like
that I've learned a lot like that could
be a whole nother video thank you so
much that's so sweet
um and I have one older sister she's 21

amazing girl girl if you could choose
juicy any celebrity live in concert who

you've got push push push just got work
very quickly doing some cute and okay so
in my last couple of videos I've done
some cooking videos and it was literally
like World War three in the comment
section beans versus not vegans it makes
me really sad that you guys are like
arguing on my channel because I just
don't want to see anyone arguing because
I want to have like a positive Channel
and the whole vegan thing is so
controversial I honestly would give it a
shot and I've also just cut a lot of
things like that out of my diet already
I've also heard like some like it's not
good for your health I don't know I
don't really want to get into like the
whole little vegan thing just cuz it's
really controversial but please no hate
on this I just I definitely have cut a
lot of that stuff out and I think
torturing animals is terrible all this
stuff we do have in my house like I was
just talking my mom about this it's all
like caged what is it's like cruelty
cage free or whatever I don't know maybe
in the future but I just I don't even
want to talk about it on my channel
because I'm so scared of all the like
like hunter know hey see wash your face
with face wash repeatedly and creepy

excited oh okay I love you too you're so
cute you're beautiful girl and YouTube
crushes I might but I'm not going to
talk about it no maybe maybe not oh okay
so I think that's all the questions I'm
going to be answering for today because
I had a lot of footage if I opened your
stature and I didn't answer your
question it's probably because I had a
ton of questions that were repeated so I
don't want to just like say the same
answer again over and over and over
again if I didn't answer your question
