routine and you might be confused of why
you see me on the screen and not me
working out I thought that I would take
you guys through my workout routine show
you it and I will talk you through it
and tell you my technique and what I
think works best and why I do it so
that's why I'll be seeing me the entire
video I apologize if I sound gross I had
an allergy attack so I'm stuck with the
sniffles now but just ignore that
hopefully my voice doesn't bother you
too much does video but yeah this video
has been requested a ton in my last
video like half the comments were you
guys asking for a workout routine so I
thought that I should definitely do it
for you guys
my workout routine I usually do this
routine that I'm gonna show you in a bit
about every day except for like one one
day or two days just one when I want to
take a break because you should allow
your body to take a break you shouldn't
work out every single day it's just too
hard on yourself I just want to make a
disclaimer I am NOT like in any way
trying to show off my body or anything
like that because I don't that's not
what I'm doing by doing this video I'm
making this video so you guys can see
what I do to stay fit and personally I'm
someone that loves food so one of the
reasons I workout as much as I do is so
I can eat whatever I want like I'm not
the kind of person that's like oh I want
to lose weight I'm gonna go on a diet
like I just can't do that I'm like oh I
want to lose weight I'm just gonna
workout a lot more because I really
enjoy food and that's like one of my
favorite parts of the day
my thing is I eat whatever I want you
know I try to stay away from like
fasting things like that and then I'll
just try to work it off so that's why I
work out almost every day just so I can
kind of eat whatever I want and stay fit
still I eat a lot if you're my friend do
you know how much height you just want
to do that quick disclaimer I know it's
not needed but just so I don't get
anything in the comments about it my
confidence level has just gone up from
working out it puts me in a better mood
every day I work out it just makes me
happier when I work out I just put my
earbuds in like I'm in my own zone and
like nothing is distracting me nothing's
like bringing me down or making me mad
or sad or anything I'm just like in my
zone and I'm doing what I'm doing and it
just makes me like happy and it's kinda
good way to let off steam also a facet
if you guys ever feel angry just work
out like it will feel so much better
than when I feel fit like it just all
around makes me like feel better you
know I suggest that if you guys want to
do that you can follow my routine and
why I don't show you guys like me
running or me doing a bike or anything
like that is because my active cardio
mostly is basketball I'm on a basketball
team for my school and we still work out
in the summer together so I have an hour
and a half of basketball almost every
day and then I do this workout usually
when I get home just to kind of you know
like tone my body because the basketball
we don't really like work on this stuff
I'm just gonna explain now that if I
were to exercise on a day where I didn't
have basketball I would either gesture
this workout to kind of like get myself
a break you know so I don't like work
myself too hard or I would go on a run
the app that I have been using just to
track like how long have ran that's kind
of all I use it for is the app called
walk free and a couple of you were
wondering that in my last video so I use
a block free just to like see how fast
I'm moving or and how long I've been
running for if I were to go on a run or
go but on a stationary bike out go on a
stationary bike if I don't have
basketball one day my run would probably
be like two miles maybe less like I
rarely do more so I would do like one or
two miles maybe a little more and then I
come home and do this workout and then
you know I take a shower and do my night
routine if you want to see my night
routine it was my last video this video
is going to be showing you an ab workout
a little bit of arms just because I
mostly do arms a basketball cuz you're
just working with your arms so much for
the game that's why I don't include a
lot of arms and then some legs and some
but I really like to keep my ABS you
know flat in like define I guess I don't
know let's get started - esse T's for
working out is music headphones from our
music and water drink water when you
guys workout definitely you can get
dehydrated and then feel really crappy
and bad things happen your body so make
sure to drink water before after or even
during your workout headphones just - I
can't not listen music when I work out
like I have to it's just I don't know if
you guys want to see what I listen to
you can go to my Spotify it's me myself
in
mell with two L's mell joy on Spotify
let me get that for you guys notes like
this and you guys can just see what I'm
listening to while I'm working out and
all my other playlists so quick Spotify
shout out so the first workout that I do
is ABS I always work on ABS kind of
first the first thing you do is 30
crunches and he'll you'll see me doing
30 crunches I just do 30 crunches
because I really think that crunches is
a good way to get your stomach toned so
I just do 30 of these and when I do
crunches I try not to use my arms like
at all I try to like only use my stomach
to lift me up because that that gives
you the best workout and for your abs
and you just like tying your abs when
you do each crunch and that's really
helpful so after I do 30 normal crunches
I do 30 side crunches on each side I
just put one leg over one another so
it's kind of like like weight so I can
like lift myself up and not like my legs
go everywhere so I do that and I just do
30 on each side as well and these are
really great for the size of your
stomach um and you can just like feel
the soreness after you do them and why
you do them and it's just like it's such
a good ab workout so I just do those
also with the crunches and then after
I'm done with those crunches I do 30
dumbbells like lifts I don't know what
to call these I just get a five-pound
dumbbell I think it's five pounds and
then I just hold any one hand and I just
bend over one way um and this works your
love handles is what I like to call them
and that's one of the biggest like
anoints is on my stomach that I have is
my love handles or you know the little
like hello fat here I do that and I do
30 on each side as well as you can see
30 is kind of my workout number I just
feel like 20s like not enough but then
like 50s too much and 40 like I don't
know
there is a good number for me I don't
know why um so I do 30 on each side and
this really helps tone the sides your
stomach and get rid of that extra fat so
I really like these and I just added
these to my workout recently so yeah and
then after I do the dumbbells I do 30
just regular sit-ups and there's way
just you can put your hands here or put
your hands out in front of you
and I kind of like it depends a day I
did mostly this here I just feel like it
gives you a really good ab workout
because you're not like you know pulling
yourself up each time which I see a lot
of people doing um so make sure when you
do your sit-ups - only engage your abs
and not your arms because I know that's
a big mistake a lot of people make the
difference is humongous you can feel it
when you just you only use your act like
you can feel so much more after I do the
30 sit-ups I do 30 pelvic raises and me
I just lay on the floor and I lift my
pelvic area up pretty much but these
like this is for your lower abs and this
works so well if you only engage your
abs and don't use your arms I mean like
it's also kind of like a leg thing but
not as much if you tighten up your abs
each time you lift your legs up you will
get such a good ab workout and I just do
30 of these as well I really like these
for the lower abs and then after those I
do 30 I don't know what to call these me
I just want like me twist because you
put your knees out in front of you and
then you put one leg down like you put
your right leg down and then you lift
your right arm over and you like twist
each time and this really helps your abs
I usually do about 30 of them but some
days when I just I'm doing them it just
doesn't feel like enough like I'm not
feeling the brilliant I'll just do 50
but I did 30 today and then after those
I do like 30 seconds to a minute of leg
holes you just put your legs down in
front of you and you just hold your legs
there but it's supposed to help your
lower abs and I just do it like a little
bit of my song that I'm listening to and
then I'll just stop and then after those
I do 30 leg raises I keep my legs in the
same position as I was when I was
holding them down and I just lift them
up and I keep them straight the entire
time and this really engages your abs
and it's a leg workout so it's a two and
one and this helps your lower abs and it
also helps your legs so I really like
these and I just do 30 of those and then
after that I do 30 straddle raises I
don't know to call these but pretty much
it's where you go like this with your
legs and this helps the inside of your
thighs so kind of where people say the
thigh gap is it's not going to like give
you a thigh gap or anything but it just
helps I just do those kind of helped put
more muscle there and let's
and so yeah I just do those and it also
helps your abs - because you're in like
this position and you're kind of like
holding it legs up as you're doing it
so it's abs and legs so two and one
again I just do 30 of those and then
after that I do 30 leg lifts on each
side you just kind of kick your right or
left leg back up in the air and then
bring it down to your stomach and make
sure to like bend your leg when you
bring it down your stomach and these
help your legs and your butt and you
feel it in your arms - because you're
holding your arms there so it's like
three in one but I really like these and
I just use 30 on each side and you can
definitely feel the burn after and then
after that I do 50 squats and this helps
your butt and your legs to just kind of
get that extra toning in your legs and
then to lift your booty up a little bit
more and then I also do ten push-ups
this is kind of the only arm thing I do
just because my arms are usually so kind
of tired from basketball on but I'll do
more sometimes if I didn't have
basketball that day and I went on a run
instead or something like you gotta keep
your arm strong so I just did ten of
those and then after that to finish my
workout to get like my heart rate going
really fast
I do 50 jumping jacks but I do speed
jumping jacks so not like slow Jeff just
I do them as fast as I can and this
really gets your heart rate going I've
got to do the strong last little kick
and then it works out your entire body I
do the 50 jumping jacks like I can feel
it in my legs in my calves it helps in a
lot in your calves I can feel it in my
arms like my abs not as much but it's
kind of like a full body workout so
that's nice to finish off my workout so
yeah that's pretty much my entire
workout I hope you guys enjoyed this
video it was really highly requested so
thing is so much for watching I love you
all so much and I'll see you guys in my
next video bye guys
