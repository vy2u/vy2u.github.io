as you can tell I don't sound so cute
right now because I'm sick but not gonna
lie I kind of always wish I had a raspy
voice since I was a kid fun fact random
fact but yeah it really looks like I'm
about to teach a workout class right now
with my ELF and everything oh my god my
voice I don't know what compelled me to
wake up as I'm sick just realize how I
haven't been going to the gym recently
life is life things come up I get busy I
get lazy you know no excuses I need to
hit the gym I'm someone who loves
working out personally even if it's not
like a super intense workout like I'll
still do many workouts almost every day
at my own place I'm not the biggest fan
of people watching me work out uh so I
like to stay at home but today I thought
why not actually go to the gym and use
the machines I felt like I needed to go
to the gym maybe it'll help me get over
this sickness since I don't have like a
strict workout routine right now in the
gym since I like don't go to the gym all
the time I want to start making myself
one so today's video is not gonna be
like a workout routine it's just gonna
be like a get back in the gym with me
video I feel like I know how to balance
working out and food so much more now
but I really still want to get get back
into the gym I should it's not like all
about body image for me for me it's like
I just want to feel good I know working
out really helps you and your happiness
so I'm just gonna go get those
endorphins and it's important in life
and I really should stop pushing it off
so anyways what I was saying is since I
don't have a strict routine yet in the
gym I'm gonna do like a playlist video
as well so I'm pretty much just gonna
play like my songs on my workout
playlist just what I listen to when I
workout cuz music is such a key thing
for me when I workout like I can't work
out without music I can barely do
anything without music okay I just I
love music so without further ado let's
get my sick ass to the gym and get me
back some endorphins baby a very nice
perk of living in an apartment
having your own gym luckily no one's
here which makes me super happy because
antisocial ass no for real I just like
working out alone okay okay I don't know
what I want to start with I know I want
to do the bike and maybe some of this
but I don't want to push myself too hard
and be like soar to where I can't move
tomorrow but okay let's start let's do
it so I don't know how people record
their workouts because there's nowhere
to set up the camera balls you know what
my eyes I'm so sorry it's like cardio
that gets me like I can do a million
sit-ups a million what is it called
squats I do that like all the time but
when it comes to cardio I'm not in the
practice of it I used to do track and
then you know I dropped out of high
school we went to all night school I
want to do the bike but there's just no
way I'm gonna find a place for you to
stay okay
oh I guess it was a sign that we
shouldn't have done cardio I wonder if
he can hear me where she is listening to
music we like these two pimples they're
like little twinkling balls so cute this
is my favorite room probably the
aesthetic come on make me cheesy so now
we're in here this is my forte we're
gonna do abs but legs I don't love
working out my arms oh my god like I
have muscle and I don't even do anything
I used to get made fun of so much for
having boy arms because I did basketball
so we did like a million push-ups every
day and that's what happened to my arms
because I did basketball since fourth
grade so I honestly just feel like my
basketball muscles I was like stick with
me you know maybe I'm tripping but
usually I like to stay away from doing
my arms let's do some ABS and get back
to the music industries in the dress
what up can be a freak in the sheets
no suicidal window window baby
all I ever wanted was some Jones
don't change now I need all 36 souls I
don't
all these I need a freezer whip it up a
beer webinar two-seater said she loved
me don't believe her
Kenny mediocre 20 on a jogger on this
type make it go crazy only gonna
stay doing 180
she said do it me baby took a
double shot we all went crazy
I didn't even bring pottery I wasn't I
think I'm just gonna wrap it this video
honestly because I've been dancing
around like an idiot for a while I'm
back from the gym I was hoping to film
more and kind of do some fun stuff in
like the other room and whatever but
someone came in to work out and I didn't
want to disrupt their workout I hope you
