today's video is going to be a video
talking about what swimsuit fits your
body type the best because summer is
coming up pretty soon and everyone's
probably going swimsuit shopping I was
just gonna kind of talk about things
that I found out in research that
accentuates like the party body that
will make you look I don't know what I'm
trying to say but it's just like four
different body types what swimsuit looks
best on that body type so should we get
started I think we should everyone has a
beautiful body out there if you're
watching this you have a beautiful body
and just wear whatever swimsuit you feel
confident in and you like because that's
the most important thing that matters so
the first one we're going to be talk
about is the pear-shaped body and if you
don't know what a parachute body is when
you're curvy at the hips and thighs and
AB it's smaller on top they said four
examples Jennifer Lawrence Beyonce so
some tips and tricks to look for a swim
suit that looks best on that body shape
for a traditional fix just like fix it
easily look for a clean skirted bottom
that falls just below the largest part
of the upper leg like pepper thigh and
avoid wearing boy shorts or a thick
banded bottom because the extra fabric
will just call more attention to that
part of your body also a plunging
neckline or like a bright fun top like
an eye-catching top draws more attention
to the upper part of your body so if you
have a pear-shaped body you can wear
some substitutes like this that I found
things if you have a small bus so like
at a smaller boobs um my research is
said that a smaller bus requires less
support um you can look for styles that
has minimal coverage or like established
detailing or bows and patterns to create
an illusion of a bigger chest so tips
and tricks is when you're looking for
some suit I'll look for a triangular top
because it adds the effect of curves and
also tops with like bold prints or like
embellishments with ruffles or anything
like that kind of adds like extra to the
chest I guess so like bra tops and like
padded tops usually create more like
illusion that it looks like you have
bigger boobs because it's pushing them
higher or like halter tops because it
gives you that extra support a smaller
always means you can wear like tiny
scoop tops or bando so I mean you can
always do that and just embrace it and
if you have a small bust you can wear
tops sort of like these okay so if
you're the opposite and have a large
bust so what to look for we're looking
for some suit if you're trying to
minimize the attention to your boobs
because they're so big
avoid the embellishments with ruffles or
bows or anything like that and try to
find um one with underwire like a bra
because it will give you the support you
need bra style tops with the adjustable
straps and the thicker the straps the
more support you have and that all
provides extra like bus support also
molded cups are good for keeping support
and when you're trying to find your
swimsuit look for your bra size make
sure to look at the sizing chart because
it might be it might run smaller big
like I know in Victoria's Secret
swimsuits are known to run smaller so if
you're like a see usually get a beer
like it do you get a see but that's just
from my experience and my friends
experience so the next body type is
athletic and if you have a nice blended
body type it means you're more straight
up and down and less curvy what to look
for when you have an athletic body type
and you're looking for a swimsuit look
for swimsuits that will give you the
illusion of curves and it's known to
wear less if you have an athletic body
type because it flops your frame and
gives you the illusion that you have
curves some tips and tricks so tops and
bottoms with like embellishments and
like really bold patterns and like
stripes and things like that they impose
like anything that kind of draws more
attention it adds in treatment and and
it can create the appearance that you
have a curvier bottom or top so if your
comes wearing a mona kini or a one-piece
that also really helps with like slashes
or strategically placed out cuts so you
know there's swimsuits that kind of like
go here then they cut at the stomach
things like that can add can add the
illusion of having curves also the
smaller the swimsuit bottom the more big
your bottom will look and tie size
bikini bottoms it's the bikinis
tithe thus I enhance curves and adjust
perfectly to your size so if you are
athletic body type look for some some
suits like this right here so if you are
a person that is a little less
comfortable with your stomach because
weight Matt might go to your stomach
when you eat and things like that
you are the tummy concealing body type
and it means that you're just a bit
you're just built a little bit more like
an apple shape and tend to have most of
your weight near the middle of you so
what to look for when you when you're
shopping for swimsuits a lot of things
that help you smooth out your middle or
tankinis and high-waisted bathing suits
so shearing supposedly works miracles
and the gathered fabric hides bulges and
creates definition in the waist so
that'll really help and I figure
flattering surplice wrap silhouette
trims the waist with its crossover
fabric so that also really helps so if
you carry most your weight on the lower
part of your stomach um try wearing a
more retro style so I'm suit like high
waisted so it gives you the appearance
of a slimming waist so kind of like
gathers everything and it just kind of
keeps everything in place and makes you
look thinner and if you are looking for
tummy concealing bathing suits they're
right here there's just some that I
picked up so the last photo type that
I'm going to be addressing is curvy so
curvy is when you have full bust like
nice good big thighs like hips and like
a butt like so the key to having a curvy
to wearing a swimsuit for a curvy body
type to highlight your curves but also
providing enough support and coverage
and if you're also not really really
into showing off your curves then then I
would steer more to the mono Keeney's
and the one-pieces because that provides
a little bit more coverage or string
bikinis that have thicker ties that can
accentuate your widest areas so some
tips and tricks of what Paquito of what
style Simsek to look for asymmetrical
swimsuit draws attention and draws the
eye toward the neckline showing off like
your collar bones and things like that
also color blocking can help highlight
your body shape and like retro swimsuits
you know the six the fixed wraps up here
and
high-waisted bikinis can also help with
that - and here are some bikinis that I
suggest looking at so thank you guys so
