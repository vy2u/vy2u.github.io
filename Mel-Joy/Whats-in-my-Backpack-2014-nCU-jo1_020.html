what's in my pack than my pack in my
backpack video I've been in school for a
couple weeks now I just went into high
school because I really didn't know what
to expect what to bring what not to
bring but I've kind of figured it out in
the last couple weeks I'm just gonna
share when I keep in my bag so this is
my backpack it's a navy blue JanSport
backpack and it is the smaller size they
have a bigger size that has like a ton
of other compartments I had a bigger one
last year for my middle school I mean I
didn't end up really using all space so
it was just more weight on my back which
I didn't really love so I thought I'd go
with a smaller backpack this year and
it's actually holding all my stuff
really well right now but what I did use
the first day is I use this purse from
the Selena Gomez collection it Sears and
for the days that I have like half day
I'll probably end up using this with
just a couple of my binders or my new
long song Guang Shan play clay please
bag in this just really dark purple
color and this is the large size and
this fits like everything you want in it
I also might end up using that too but
right now I've just been using a
backpack and it's been working out
really well for me so let's get started
so I have six classes then freaking I
don't have a binder for all of my
classes because they said that we could
share binders for different classes so
for some I just have one binder
dedicated to it in some I'm splitting
the binder though the first binder I
have is just to really light pink pastel
pink oh I think it's really cute and I
use this for math we get a lot of math
like assignments so that's why I have my
own binder just dedicated to it this is
a one inch binder and this is from
Office Depot
so my next binder is just this pretty
blue color and you can see this as a
divider because I use this for English
and history so I have half of it
dedicated to English they're kind of
similar so that's why I put them
I have this navy blue binder this is for
science so that's for biology and I also
have a king five star notebook to go
with my English
this is required college line I got all
this stuff at Office Depot by the way
and then the next thing I have is my
elective folder this is for my film
class and it's just a white folders we
don't get up a ton of assignments or
anything I figured I don't need like a
huge binder here is my white PE by next
one inch as well
I also this purple binder and I haven't
assigned this for a class yeah but later
in the school year I'll see like where I
get a lot of handouts and I might just
put this for English and the blue
Peralta's for your reverse or this for
my film class or define depending like
health class anything so this is just
kind of an extra binder that's purple my
favorite color the next thing I have is
this black notebook but it is for graph
paper I may use this yet but this is for
math the next thing I have is this black
planner and it just says 2014-2015 on it
it's from for a pin size just gray and
white and red it's my baby so I just
have this to write down on my homework
and just to stay organized so this is
really helpful the next thing I have
actually are my sneakers for PE they're
just Nike for you run 5.0 I didn't want
to wear these to school cuz it didn't
bounce my outfit so I just brought these
in my backpack the next thing I have is
a used water bottle and I definitely
definitely would recommend bringing a
water bottle this is just a cute purple
blue color I was dehydrated once turn it
over the summer and it suck it coldly
totally sucks so make sure to stay
hydrated because you are in the Sun a
lot and especially after PE in between
classes it helps your brain refocus so I
would suggest bringing a water bottle to
school next thing I have is my pencil
case
and I use this last year too and I just
thought I'd keep it because I couldn't
find any better ones and I just have a
ton of stuff in here like I don't want
to open it because it'll all fall out
but something I've been really liking
for the school year they are these
papermate Flair pens and I set the
medium size they come with a ton of
different colors and they're just pens
and I love this for like color coding
and note-taking and you know orange just
for math and blue is right a they just
come in handy and I've been using them a
lot I also have pushup eraser colored
pencils highlighters some colored pens
some lead this is just 7.7 some scissors
their kids scissors on erasable pen
these are so handy and cool and I really
like them I have a glue stick a sharpie
and I have my favorite type pencils
these ones I have a teal color and this
lime color I actually keep these in this
pocket so I can just reach in and just
grab it it's really easy to access and I
use them for every class so I want them
in a more reachable place but as you can
tell I just have a time ton of stuff in
my pencil case and enfold it fits
everything I really like that ok so that
everything in the big pocket and now in
this smaller pocket I have this cute
little makeup bag and in here I kind of
have the more cosmetic type things I
have a mini deodorant because at a point
in time we go swimming in PE and your
deodorant might rub off while you're
going swimming so you might need to
freshen up on the line of swimming I
just have a couple makeup products
because if your makeup gets ruined I'm
also gonna put makeup wipes right now I
don't have like a mini pack like I want
to get
pack I'm going to put in there these of
your eyeliner smudges everywhere it'll
be messy so you said this star look
slack eyeliner in opps ideon it's just a
black kohl eyeliner it's super super
bold so if i just want to put on my
waterline make my eyelashes look thicker
or my lower water moon or anything like
that
I'll have it and then I have this
they're real mascara mini and I use the
big one like the normal sized one
everyday for my makeup and this is
pretty much out but I just have this if
my eyelashes like get clumpy or
something while after I swim I can just
like reapply it and it'll be all good
but I have to eat my second to last
class so I might not be using these
things but just in case you know and I
also the smokey Kohl Sephora eyeliner in
1300 and it's just a brown shimmery
color in case I want to do more of a
natural look like dark black I'm just
gonna end up seeing which one I used and
if I don't use them I'll just take them
out and if I use them I'll keep them
still kind of neat to figure that out
and something that's super important is
sunblock so this is sunscreen it is the
Neutrogena ultra sheer dry touch
sunblock SPF 55 weightless clean feel
and that's good because you don't want
to look oily and sticky and feel gross
so I just have this mini tube for if
we're doing pee outside or I'm walking
around a lot cuz you don't want to get
burned you don't want to get skin cancer
from the Sun so this is super important
and I would definitely recommend it the
next thing I have in here is a headband
and this is from champion and it's it
has like silicone on the inside so it
sticks to your hair and this is just if
you're in PE and your hair gets all
frizzy
you just pop this in your hair and it'll
be all good and the next thing I have is
some gum I think I'm gonna I don't have
make them right now but I'm definitely
going to put that in because you want to
have fresh right Island berry line I'm
very lime it smells really good tastes
really good so I just have this for when
you have like a sweet tooth but you're
not going to eat candy I would recommend
that and we cannot we can eat gum in
some of my
so I also have a hand sanitizers you
don't want to get sick so no no in case
you touch you go under your desk or so
much history and if they leave the dirt
residue I don't know but just in case I
have the Sweet Pea Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
hand sanitizer and then this is my
banana boat SPF 45 aloe vera vitamin E
chapstick and this is awesome like
smells like bananas and wonderfulness
and it tastes really good
and it feels really good on your lips
and that's everything I keep in this
little thing and I also have sunglasses
just in case it's really sunny at lunch
you don't want to hurt your eyeball so
yeah I have these these are from H&amp;amp;M and
this is my teal pencil that I keep in
that same area so I can just really easy
access it and use it because I use it
all the time
so that's pretty much everything I keep
in my backpack
it might change over the year so if it
does and I end up using a purse I'll
definitely refilm the video I hope you
