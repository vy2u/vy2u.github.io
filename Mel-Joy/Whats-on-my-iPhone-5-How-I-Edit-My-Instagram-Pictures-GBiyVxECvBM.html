what's on my iPhone 5 video so here's my
phone it's just a white iPhone 5 just in
silver because they didn't have gold and
five it fitted I totally we've gotten it
but they didn't this is my case that's
on it right now I switched cases once in
a while but this is an Amazon case and I
held this case cuz it's so colorful and
cute but it's like seriously so so off
like I feel like suede that's why I
really like it I hope this lighting is
better please let me know because I'm
experimenting with some lighting
equipment that I just got because I had
a gift card let's just get right into it
the first thing you see is my home
screen it's just some tied I bowl I like
tie-dye and when you open my phone the
homepage looks like this it has my
calendar up at the top I don't really
use it but that's there my photos and I
have a ton of photos of 2499 photos and
so if you could tell I really like to
take photos and I've camera and videos
and maps and passbook and weather and
notes and reminders and clock and
newsstand and stocks app store Game
Center settings voice memo Safari
contacts FaceTime and mail and most of
that spam mail so that sucks so that's
that first page I mean I use some of
these things but not like a ton so in my
bottom row down here I just have phone
and then I just have messages and
Spotify and oh my gosh I'm obsessed with
Spotify I Spotify Premium because I love
music and ten dollars a month could be a
lot but rather than having iTunes where
you buy a song for like 129 I haven't
limited songs like in one of my
playlists I have 181 songs then I don't
want to know how much that would be
usually but in a way this is my playlist
if you guys want me to make a public
playlist and share it with you guys I
would love to do that Simon oh yes those
are my songs and then I have snapchat
snapchat is literally my life I used
to communicate like it's me hi but I
just use snapchat to communicate with
all my friends and everything's and
videos and pictures and if you want me
to make a public snapchat I could do
that too
just let me know first folder I have our
utilities so just calculate a compass
and then I Ward web that comes in handy
when I need to look up a meaning of a
word I so sure I love social I have a
lot of apps and social I vine which I
don't really use and just watch I have
Twitter and you guys should definitely
go follow me it's Mel underscore joy

don't really actually answer questions I
just use it to look at people's stuff
what I gotta do and then I Skype because
I like to grab with my friends on the
night facebook Messenger which goes
along with Facebook and then in
photography my personal favorites did
you remain oh crap is after light is
definitely on my top two I have two
top favorites but after light I'll just
say gun my personal favorite is to take
selfies on
so I'm doing something so I like it I
don't like it redo okay I just took a
selfie who saved it to my gallery and
I'm going to go to after lights upload
my selfie and hear what I love to do in
this is make things like that I use this
pretty much centered all my photos so
the first thing comes with is all these
different options which I love you can
sharpen the photo blur the photo gray
fade I mean this is just like so many
things like look Oh change the
brightness contrast saturation exposure
all that kind of stuff and after light
is $0.99 and then all the filter is
microsoft favorite filter is rust and I
really like Lila just as like a fade to
my photo oh that's so cool okay Fusion
is like where you combine filters and
then make it your own
I think that is really awesome I did I
did not know about that no I really like
ash cool Raven I usually do like a mix
of all those and then here the light
leaks these are just all the light leaks
you can do on the photo all that stuff
dusty things you know just a little
speckles on you can do instant film we
have to buy it about here I'll show you
what it looks like I don't you can
really cool some of it things which I
don't really use that's pretty much
after light and then my next thing is
photo grid and that is pretty much just
here I make stitches I'm just going to
stay the same photo you can make
stitches change the ratio and then do
that and then change the border I know
you do a lot with this but I just like
this one I want to do like you know
picture my friends make landscape
portrait like oh this is what a lot of
people used to do like you have enough
today's my two selfies or you can also
just um you can mirror it so it's like
ooh but you kind of get that that's what
I use that for then I have insta collage
I need to sin a while but this is this
is just to you know make collages with
more than one and then this is I just
got this actually new it's Magic Hour
there's just a lot of filters you can
and I don't know if I like this yet
because I haven't really used it that's
there and I picked start I don't really
use that but it's there
my fiscal cam fiscal cam is kind of my
first second favorite ish I love Mel
vsco cam and after like together like
that is my ideal editing thing so if you
guys want to get stuff get after light
which is any nine cents and get vsco cam
which is free so like go to photos and
hit add and I'll add this picture of me

filters you can do so yeah that's that
and i also really liked on this fade i
just like makes it really pretty and
tumblr ish i guess so I really like fade
and another thing is skin tone this can
like make your skin tone more pink
getting red whatever rain and there's
pretty much most of the things that
after light has I know I really like
vsco cam and I would I would definitely
suggest getting Bisco cam and then
there's molded and this just has you
know a ton of different things to photo
wonder we're going to edit this but it's
good for blemish fix and there's also
effects on this I mean I don't want to
use the effects but that's there and
