trying to figure out who I was felt
uncomfortable living everyday in my own
skin you're constantly changing as a
person change helps you realize who you
are something's off and then your way
needs to fix it so hello my beautiful
best friend today's video is going to be
a much more personal video this video is
completely on the spot so it might be
rambling whatever I'm sorry about that
but that is me I'm a rancher you guys
know that what this video is all about
change and all about growth and all
about also me and like youtubers social
media people just everyone literally
everyone I was getting ready else
putting on my makeup after it's on my
makeup to film I was like you know what
like s it I'm not going to do my hair
I'm going to throw on a hoodie and I'm
just going to talk to you guys because
this has been on my mind and it's been
bothering me and I just need to get it
off my chest and I want you guys to just
understand what I'm thinking and hear me
out for just a second so yeah pretty
much what stemness that I woke up this
morning honestly like what I usually do
in the morning is check on my social
media and check in with you guys
see if you guys are liking the new video
of this week and all that stuff I
constantly read the comments so
literally check in the comments every
day making sure you guys like it
whatever so today when I saw the
comments on my car tour video it like
actually I am I have been seeing a lot
of comments on my videos about me
changing and about how I took my break
and I came back for our break as a new
person and you guys miss the old Mel and
whatever and reading those comments like
as much as hate shouldn't affect someone
these affect me personally because it's
all about like my personality and me as
a person and changing there was common
thing like I'm no longer down-to-earth
and I'm superficial and I'm only in it
for the money and I just want to sit
down and explain because everyone has
the wrong idea
we're not everyone because I know
there's a lot of loyal subscribers who
spread love on my channel with each
other not just me you guys are making a
better community for ourselves so I just
want to say thank you to all the
Bordeaux subscribers all the ones that
give me such nice comments and saving
all of my videos and everything like
that
it's just that means the world and
that's what I care about what today's
video is going to be not
about that just because you guys are
amazing there's a lot more new cool
stuff coming for the ones who care and
like my videos I was completely planning
on filming a different video today but
once I woke up and saw these comments
and everything I just
this couldn't not be filmed you know
just because there's a lot of change
that I've been going through as a person
I just want sit here and talk about it
this is my favorite thing to do sit down
and talk to you guys in front of the
camera of me you it will always be my
favorite thing and I want you guys to
know that because I know I haven't been
doing a typical melted-down videos
laughable videos which I think some
people are like what's going on but I
just wanted to branch out I just wanted
to try a new thing YouTube and life is
all about trying new stuff right so even
though there's not going to be a
sit-down video every week my channel is
still going to stay how I wanted to in
that way because my thing is you guys
you guys it's like I think that it would
be fair to say I changed as a person
meaning on the inside personality wise
how you treat people how you whatever
you could arguably say that I changed if
I wasn't caring about all of this do you
know what I mean because I care so much
for you guys and seeing these comments
really just hurt and I don't think look
don't want to cry nice for you there's
been a lot of comments about like my
personality and in that way I just want
to really explain myself because it's
also like you guys aren't with me every
day to see how I treat people how I am
because to the most part I think I'm the
exact same person I am when I started my
youtube channel but there's things in
life that when you grow up you're going
to change because when I was 15 I
wouldn't have thought to wear half the
things I want to wear and have the
things I like to wear I think what a lot
of people are messing up in the fact
that people are changing is how they
dress how they wear their makeup
whatever with different videos they
produce after they change this change
that I'm using that this video is all
like change because I don't necessarily
agree with this change so this is also
not just about me I've seen a lot of
other youtubers in the same position as
me a lot of social media people in the
same position as me I just think there
needs to be a video explaining it do you
know what I mean because I just thought
about
hardcore everyday I'm someone who thinks
constantly about what I could improve in
my own life when I to improve in my
friends lives in your life whatever I'm
just constantly thinking and recently
this has been this thing on my mind
because dreams settling people
discussing and talking about in liking
the comments in whatever and agreeing
that your personality is superficial and
you're no longer someone that used to be
I don't know if I'm making any sense at
all and I don't think I am now if you're
editing this girl I'm sorry I don't even
know what I'm saying so I've been seeing
a lot of those comments and I just
wanted to clear it up because I care
about you guys more than anything you
guys are my world there's just a lot of
stuff you don't see in a way I wish you
could see the behind the scenes I'm
going to start using my vlog channel a
lot more just for fun stuff so you guys
can see this and see me more often and
how I live my life and everything like
that because I think you'd be surprised
of me being kind of the same person
otherwise I think a lot of people forget
that social media influencers is a job
it's also a hobby which is how I got
into it I need to know it was a job it
is a job and it does take time and money
and everything to produce videos and to
do what you want as you go to your
channel you want to up your game or
whatever I got my sick equipment I want
to start producing videos that I would
love and you guys would hopefully love
and it's just really sad as I'm trying
to grow up and I'm trying to find myself
as a person getting beat down on for the
person you're becoming
since I have been seeing this discussion
of change within myself I was like I
wanna watch my own videos and compare me
to now like you guys have been doing
because I don't really I'm not aware of
this kind of change that's been
happening because I don't watch my own
videos I just when I feel my act like
myself you know I don't only know this
I'm acting different than I used to and
I don't really did it and when I did
look back at my videos I was like oh
obviously I've changed I look super
different I talk different because I've
learned more vocabulary that I like to
use and you're constantly changing as a
person you're constantly progressing
also I think change is not a bad thing I
think change helps you realize who you
are and I think part of this change
that's been happening is when I took my
break from YouTube I did not I didn't
know who I was I felt like I
it's really hard I don't want to grind I
didn't want to just how much attention
to it and whatever during that break or
anything I just I lost myself and it's
really it's really hard to talk about
and I I just want to bring awareness to
it because I think it's a problem that
teenagers struggle with all the time
there's all these people that you feel
like you have to live up to or be
someone for I just I just completely
lost myself because I was like I'm
trying to be the person that all these
people want me to be I'm reading these
comments and I'm taking their feedback
if I seem a certain way I made it like
that I need to change it and I was all
about what other people wanted me at who
they wanted me as I just always put
others first ever third a room first
of me I put what they wanted from me
first
I just in a way I didn't almost I didn't
matter to myself and when I was on that
break I just a time to find myself
because I was changing my hair color
every week I had brownie right orange
rises I didn't even know I was just I
don't even really remember what was
going to my mind but I just something
felt one I was like this doesn't mean
this is not me I just felt uncomfortable
living every day in my own skin and
something was off and I knew I need to
fix it so that's why I take the time off
and is really splayed out in my video
but I didn't really realize that's why
just time off I do I didn't understand
it until now when I realized I was
trying to figure out who I was picking
off my allergy stitches trying to fake
pain like who was I would I like to do
you know and recently I think I've
discovered myself I've discovered myself
a lot more I'm proud of myself but I'm
happy about it cuz I learned I want to
put myself first and I don't always do
it in every situation you know I'm using
my way up to it I don't think I will
ever put myself first in every situation
because that's just not who I am I grew
up in a family and a society at school
that taught everyone to love everyone
and to spread laws and I think that it
stuck with me because I want to love
everything around me you know I just I
want to give to them I want them to feel
happy I want them to feel loved I just
want to spread it and I think now that's
changed or whatever is just me growing
and discovering who I am and who I want
to be throughout my life I mean this is
just going to be the permanent me
forever here I mean like you're
constantly changing I'm going to be
constantly changing so I'm my parents
age this journey has been so much
changing growth for me it in such a good
way and I'm happy about it you know I'm
finally so happy about it and when I see
these come and say have changed in a bad
way it's like maybe I am that person you
know and I know I shouldn't do it but I
do because that's what I've been doing
since we started YouTube it's like my
thing has always been read every comment
listen to you guys pay attention to you
guys and I have to learn to only pay
attention to the love now because I do
have more hate than I did what I didn't
have as many subscribers I'm going to
learn how to deal with it and grow with
it and change with it I just want you
guys to know that I still love them care
about you more than anything I just
wanted to explain this because you guys
are literally my best friends and you
guys deserve to know this I'm such a
Rambler brother the kids oh and also
very quickly about the car tour I'm not
going to explain myself out of this or
anything but I actually was
contemplating filming that video for
three months since I've got in the car
because I was like do I want to put this
out there I don't want to look
superficial I don't want to look
materialistic I don't want to exploit by
the way a lot of comments are saying my
parents bought that car for me I
actually leased it which is cheaper and
for myself it's not me you guys do any
better I feel like I just shouldn't be
having to talk myself out of these
things
I'm going to stop it I just wanted to
make this video to let you know that I
do consider your other's feelings and
your opinions with every move I make
with my youtube every single move but
the reason I did do that video is
because it was my number one requested
video from you guys and I wanted to take
that input that you guys gave me and use
this for the better and give you guys
something that you want you know I'm
going to give this person what I'm
really excited about it I ended it all
cool different from my other videos but
it's just I guess know so I did end up
posting it and in a way I'm like maybe I
should have listened to my gut feeling
but I also want to give you guys the
Clinton you want to see so it's kind of
hard going back and forth but I realized
that I just need to do what makes me
happy I am going to try to make you guys
as happy as I can but I'm also just
going to be myself and hopefully myself
is good enough for you and will make you
happy and I hope it does
I've been so inspired I've had so many
ideas when I was on my break I wasn't
inspired and now I'm extremely expired I
just I want to film so many videos that
I've been wanting of them and I want to
get off it just you know change the
style of editing for a video try to
thing and on my vlog Channel I want to
start using that like hell just so many
videos with me and my friends more of
just me living my daily life for you
guys to see and as I grown as I prints
more videos I'm still going to stay true
to myself I'm still gonna do these tada
videos all the time because our favorite
and I feel like it's the most one-on-one
with you guys I feel like there's a lot
more I wanted to say and I always just
forget because I ramble but the whole
point is video is to let you guys know
that change is good if you're going
through change and you're scared or
whatever don't worry because life would
not be the way life is without change we
run that phones computers anything
everything involved everything changes
not just the world but people and I
think that it's okay and I don't know I
hope you guys liked this video and saw
the kind of different side of me for a
hot and emotional unstable side of me I
just wanted to say from the bottom of my
heart thank you to all my loyal
subscribers who have been with me from
the start or from a couple weeks ago or
a couple months ago just thank you for
watching my videos and hopefully
enjoying them and sticking with me and
talking on Twitter it's like it's so
cool that is a thing that we can do you
know talk to people across the world
it's just sick it's so sick and I didn't
mean to complain it all about the heat
or anything this video just a disclaimer
even though part of my personality to
disclaim everything and like fight back
for myself it's just part of me i'ma leo
you know don't have a closet for a
little bit but for real I love you guys
to infinity and beyond I mean it when I
say it and I hope you know that and I
hope that you're having a marvelous
morning afternoon or night and I will
hopefully see you in my next video
