today's video is going to be something I
really felt the need to make and address
I just wanted you guys to hear my whole
story of this I'm not blaming you guys
this was not your fault this was just a
miscommunication and it makes sense
because you know one YouTube video you
can't see someone's whole life I could
just talk about it forever the internet
really only shows a part of your life I
don't even know where to start this
video but I quickly wanted to show you
guys my lip progress because I know a
lot of you guys have been asking for
that and stuff it's only been like how
many days a week I'm gonna say a week
maybe a little less I have two little
bumps right here you can see when I
smile they're not gonna look like this
it's still some swelling takes two weeks
to heal so we'll see how they look in
two weeks really quickly before we start
this video I just wanted to say you guys
mean the world to me
and I mean it from the bottom of my
heart you guys why do I always I swear
to God the only part I get emotional
eating that was just thinking about you
guys and your support and stuff well put
yourself together I can't express how
much I care about you guys but I hope
you know it and I want to jump into this
video to explain what was going through
my head when I got my lip injections why
I did it and it happened so fast that I
literally had to take some time after
and think about like holy what did I do
this could have really affected my
channel I didn't think it would and I
got I just freaked out so anyways I just
think life is taken so seriously to the
point where like I just wanted to know
what my lips would have looked like a
little bigger and I got eyelash
extensions I got my hair done multiple
times a lot of times I was dyeing my
hair purple and like sixth grade you
know I've always been someone who loves
experimenting with the way I look the
way I dress for me this was another
learning experience about like beauties
I like to not live my life in fear
because I think that's when you learn
most about yourself and for me I learned
that lip injections I don't even think
of that big of a deal like they're not
for me at least for the side like this
experience it wasn't mostly just like I
hate my lips I feel unconfident with my
lips like yes I've always felt
unconfident with my lips there was
something to try
no I think I've made that video really
serious and really whatever and then it
took a wrong turn and I really meant to
say that like I love experimenting with
stuff I just love trying new things I
spend a lot of time staring at myself
tonight
edit my videos like I'll literally wake
up in the morning do some stuff I'll
start editing at 12:00 p.m. edit till
12:30 a.m. and I'm also quite a
perfectionist so I like my videos to be
the best they can be but sometimes I get
too caught up in that and I think they
end up being worst because I trim about
it too much looking at myself for so
long I think it can actually take a toll
I mean as a person in like hardcore I
literally start to pick myself apart if
you get really really tiring especially
if you don't like how the way you look
and you're not confident in that
I'm not giving excuses and I'm not doing
whatever I'm just letting you know what
I was thinking and what was going
through my head cuz that's what I do I
keep it real with you guys I'm not gonna
hide how I feel I don't know why I'm
crying literally my body just starts
crying when I talk about sad stuff I
know a lot of you thought the live
injections video was super like shocking
just because my message over the years
have been to love yourself like
completely for who you are and I still
believe that and I think in a way it got
twisted within the comments but I want
you guys to know that like my main
message still is to love yourself but
for me I've learned so much about life
over time and I've learned to take it
not as seriously because life is short
and why not live your life the way
you've always wanted to I've learned to
love myself and learn to love within
just love me love my big heart and how I
treat people and how I always care and
things like that I think what really
really matters is with it and I may not
be a hundred percent confident a hundred
said happy I understand whatever but
that doesn't mean I can't preach to be
right I want you guys to be the happiest
you can be and the most confident you
can be even if I'm in a little funk or
I'm doing something I'm here to grow
with you guys on being confident and
being happy and whatever and I want to
help you guys with what I've learned and
what I'm trying to learn I just want you
guys to know that I will never change
myself when it comes to society I want
to sound mean but I don't really love
our society as
sometimes I wish I was just born in the
1970s or something like that and I grew
up you know walking to my friend's house
instead of calling them and texting them
I just want you guys to know I will
always stay true to who I am even if
that meant getting lip injections like
that's what I wanted to do whatever if
I'm gonna stay true to it I will always
keep it real and share my decisions in
life and hopefully it'll help you guys
grow you can see someone making mistakes
in their life doing this just try new
stuff and you can you can take it in and
see if it's helped me and see if it's
done this I just want to be real that's
always been my thing I don't want to
like throw my problems on you guys so I
try not to do that and I try to focus on
the positive things you know my videos
but everyone goes through and I want you
guys to know that if I seem down the new
video or if I miss a week it's like I'm
a teenager I'm still learning stuff I'm
still figuring out who I want to be what
I want to be in this world and it's just
a learning process life is all about
learning and becoming who you want to be
in not giving a Fripp about how people
look at you or how people talk about you
it's just happiness drone I want to be
genuinely happy and that's all I'm
working for in my life right now I love
making videos I love editing videos I
love just creating content pouring my
heart and soul into it I don't know I
just think I was the happiest when I was
just engulfed into YouTube you know and
like I want to do it again I'm gonna
start posting twice a week I made a
whole schedule for my videos and what
day I film and whatever I want to step
up my game I'll be talking to you guys
way more I'm excited I just realized in
life you need to figure out your
priorities and I really figured out my
priorities over the past couple of
months and seeing how people treat you
in priorities and just taking it all in
and learning how you can live your life
better from it and more happy I don't
know if any of this is making any sense
I am such a good Rambler I want to have
fun on YouTube I want to do what I love
and I hope you guys can enjoy it with me
and I hope this video maybe lets you see
a different look on this whole situation
I was just so sad thinking that you guys
were looking at me as this different
person what I feel you know more wise
and more grown and more myself I'm sorry
for this mishap from the bottom of my
heart the last thing I want to do is
offend anyone and hurt anyone
you guys just got to see just what I was
thinking throughout this whole
experience you know if you excited for
two days the week upload like I am give
it a thumbs up I love you guys to
infinity and beyond
I mean it when I say it and I hope you
know that I really do I hope you know
that and you already know I hope you're
having a marvelous morning afternoon or
night you know hopefully you see your
beautiful face in my next video I don't
know a day I'm uploading it I'll figure
it out but it's gonna be two days a week
I love you guys and just thank you for
hearing me out if you made it to the end
of this video you're freaking awesome
