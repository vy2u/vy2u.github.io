doing an iPhone case collection I own
the iPhone 5 in white I'm going to just
show you all my cases I've had this
phone for about a year and I got most of
these cases like right after I got my
phone because it was kind of the you
know getting to realize you have an
iPhone stage but now I don't buy cases
very often let's get into it so the
first one that I'm just wearing on my
phone right now is light turquoise
aquamarine color I just have two pieces
of tape I actually put on very recently
when I was at my friend's house because
I thought the pink the blue looked
really cute together
on the front just looks like this it
goes all the way around and it is like a
silicone gel material and I have dropped
my phone in this couple of times and it
has survived so this case is from Amazon
and it was like two two dollars so very
pleased with this case and I really
liked it my next case that I bought I
mean my first case ever was at a little
technology store this was $2.00 $2.99 it
is clear in the back and then on the
sides it's a mint well it used to be a
mint now it's like brown because I just
used it so much protected my phone
pretty well my next case is this really
cute
sunflower Rainbow case also from her
Amazon I believe this one was $5.99 I
put this in my jean pocket and it
started getting blue around the side so
I took it out and changed the case
because I really like this case I didn't
wanted to get ruined it's a matte case
but it's like really soft it just has
all these colors and it looks really
cute on your phone my next case is this
case that says the past is like an
anchor holding us back you have to let
go of who you are to become who you want
to be and I thought that was just a
really nice message and I really liked
the anchor at the top and this is also
from Amazon and this was $10 more more
expensive
when I thought and it has cracked also
at the bottom so I just after it cracked
couple times and just check it off my
phone and I haven't had it on recently I
have some scratches at the top to a hard
case like plastic my next case I don't
really know what was going through my
mind when I got this case this case is
from Amazon was $5.99 and it is a mint
green color also plastic and harden has
black right there and it is covering
gold studs but it's a very intense case
I don't know if you can tell but you can
see the hot glue in some places but I
mean someone made the case I'm after
like hold it in your hand and typing
makes your hands feel like metal since
metal my next case is this floral case
that has a cross right here in bronze
studs this reminds me of wildflower
cases except this wasn't 189 on Amazon
it's the same material as this one the
studs actually came off right after I
got them like it all just peeled off so
I just glued them back on with hot glue
no superglue I believe and now they stay
on pretty well then I just really like
it I think it's cute cakes with a gift
my friend gave me my birthday
it's an American flag case I think it's
cute good for like fourth of July and
things like that and this is from
forever 21 and it was 780 and this is
just this plastic that's this one my
next case in this case from Amazon
ignore the stickers I probably take the
stickers off as you tell I haven't worn
this case since Christmas time it's just
a white case that has black up here and
then bronze studs there they like make
indents but I had this on my phone for a
very long time and it's also the plastic
you kind but agnostic is it from
babysitting that's this one and this was
like $2.99 on himself the next case is
from brandy melville this was a $10
case and it says I love you to the moon
and back and I thought this was adorable
it's a matte case but as you can tell
after wearing it for a while the matte
fades off and it gets shiny and that's
kind of why to get off also because it
cracked at the bottom so this is not a
very sturdy case but I just really liked
it and I thought it was really cute and
I like this thing and this case I got
like right after I ordered my phone
because I really wanted a case like this
it is a pink wallet case it has a handle
here and when you open it up there's
places to put your credit cards gift
cards places you could put your money
and then it comes with I'm blanking out
but it's the pen that you like right on
your phone with you know which is really
helpful because in here it's kind of
hard to like be typing with all this
stuff so you can just be like dude over
here it's the case for the phone it's
not super protective but when the whole
case is on it it's pretty protective and
this was $12.99 on Amazon plus shipping
though might have been 18 I got this one
on Amazon for two dollars because I
wanted it to be my protective case and
it's just purple and white I think it's
almost look like the OtterBox cases and
think about this is the front camera
doesn't align with the front camera on
the phone so whenever you take like a
selfie there's like a white vignette
around you because it's the white case
so that's the only annoying thing about
that but this camera is fine and it just
three pieces though is this and I've
only one ass on my phone a couple times
because I have a real protective case
now I'll show you next but this is my
protective case this is the lifeproof
case I just got it in black because
that's the only kind they had a target
and they had a deal that if you bought a
lifeproof case you would get a free $20
gift card to Target which I thought was
a great deal so it's a Christmas gift
that I asked for these are $80 I believe
and this is the new kind so this one has
no screen here's actually touch your
phone you don't know what a lifeproof
case
is its waterproof shockproof dustproof
mud proof any much everything-proof see
how it's this is yep the newer kind in
it's just two pieces like that you just
put on your phone shut up the sides shut
the little thing here and also comes the
headphone thing that's cruising it out
um I love this it's really fun
especially during this summer to take
pictures underwater with your friends it
can go six feet under the water you have
a friend that had a lifeproof case and
her phone died in it some water leaked
through I think because she had her own
screen protector on her phone which it
says you're not supposed to have so
water leaked in I've had no problem with
mine so far my next case I have never
warned but I thought I just included I
got it for Christmas but it came after
Christmas because Amazon shipping
sometimes takes a really long time it is
just this sweater red and white case
it's really pixelated oh no it's still
cute and this was like five dollars
my next case kind of case is a bumper I
recently went to Spain and I brought my
phone and it had a blue bumper around
did a light blue bumper that I got at
the same store as I draw this case and
that was $2.99 the bumper started
peeling like this part like it is
actually right now but there it was
peeling and it was almost all the way
peeled so I was just at some store with
my friends in Spain and I saw a bumper
for 299 euros actually I was like okay I
should get this because it was hard to
take photos with the blue bumper because
it's in the camera so anyways it's just
a black plain bumper I actually find
bumpers to be very protective because it
covers the front and back of your phone
but and some of my cases don't so I had
this on my phone for a pretty long time
and I like bumpers a case also from
Amazon as you can tell I really like
game is all in her cases and I love this
so much I had this on my phone for I
believe like three months I just I
really like it it's maybe blue and has
stars
and then like it's really cute it
actually has started to peel away since
I used it so much at the top up here
it's been cracked it also plastic and I
don't really know I just really liked
how it looked on my phone so that was my
