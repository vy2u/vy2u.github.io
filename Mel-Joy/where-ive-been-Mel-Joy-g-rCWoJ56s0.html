past like two months hello my beautiful
best friend so pretty much this video is
going to be explaining where I've been
what I've been doing what's been up with
me why I haven't posted in a frickin
month just all the changes in my life
that has been going on so it's kind of
just going to be like a life update with
me and whatever and before I get into
this video I really really quickly just
wanted to apologize and say I'm sorry
for being absent I tried to keep active
on my social media so you guys didn't
think I was like quitting or anything I
just want to let you guys know that I
love YouTube I love you guys this is my
dream I'm literally living my dream I'm
so blessed I'm so thankful for each and
every one of you I really mean it when I
say it so that's literally going to be
this whole video just me sitting down
and explaining everything so the first
thing if you can't tell I'm blonde again
there's quite a funny story that goes to
this I was brunette for awhile I got my
hair brown and naturally blonde not this
one them and then I tried to remove my
hair dyed instead of dyeing my hair
bright orange bright orange so I went to
the salon and it took them six hours to
fix my fire orange hair so we're at this
now I like it I'm not going to touch my
hair for a while because it's going to
get damaged and I'm trying to keep a
nice you feel me so pretty much I don't
remember I was saying cuz I got up I
have missed filming editing interacting
with you guys on YouTube so crazy much
but I'm just going to explain one
quickly why I've kind of been a my I
know it's just a hard video to come on I
think part of the reason I was putting
off filming this is because I knew the
first video that I would film to put on
my channel once my break was over it
would be this video and it's really hard
to film because you're kind of
explaining all the going through when
you don't really even want to accept it
because you don't want to be going
through it anyway so pretty much my
entire life or a lot of my life I've
dealt with a lot of anxieties and some
depression in my life I'm someone who
doesn't like love to talk about my
problems like I will to people you know
who I feel comfortable with and whatever
and I do feel comfortable with you guys
like you guys
my best friend but I also have this
feeling of like when I talk about my
problems I feel like I'm being spoiled
and not really you know taking in
everything I have and I never want it to
seem like that I always want to seem
like I'm grateful because I am so
grateful but there are times where like
my anxiety gets really bad or I get
depressed or whatever it's something
that I've really been struggling with
for the past month and I'm not really
sure why I think something that happens
to me is that I kind of push away my
problems I push away everything and then
it explodes and I think that this might
have been the kind of explosion and my
body just kind of shuts down and tells
me like you need to like chill and
really think about your life and I think
about what will make you happy and what
was whatever so pretty much the past
month I felt incredibly unmotivated
incredibly just like I don't want to go
out I want to lay in my bed recently
I've been trying to do everything I can
to fix it
my dad is like one of my best friends so
he's been helping me a lot thing is and
he's dealt with it himself it's almost
as if when I have the anxiety or when I
have the depression it feels like I
can't get out of it and I'm just stuck
you know and usually it lasts like a
couple days or weeks but this was the
longest like episode that has ever
happened to me it's been more than a
couple months a few months whatever I
don't know how to put it into words I
really wish I did but let's see I'm
going to try this is gonna be a very
real honest video like I really feel
like I owe you guys an explanation and
it's not fair for me to just keep in my
problems and even someone commented on
my video and I said I think it'd be nice
for you to share your problems with us
because I always pictured you as a
perfect person with a perfect life and
whatever but obviously that's not true
and we'd like to like know more about it
and it's so so true like I am NOT
perfect in any way shape or form I have
problems in my life I deal with them I
have thoughts I have whatever it's just
I mean it's part of life everyone I
think ghosts or that but I think one of
the biggest things about myself I put a
lot of pressure on myself I'm quite a
perfectionist if I didn't like my brown
hair I didn't want to spill or if I just
like my own sugar which I proved did it
I would want to film and I guess I
really felt like I wanted to take a
break to focus on myself and to try to
become really happy because since I do
put my life
on the Internet and I do share it with
whoever but I do want to let you guys
know that I have made a drastic dress
improvement in my happiness and just
life and also something I really also
wanted to address which I don't think
I've really seen a lot of people address
this on youtube but it's about youtubers
changing I could talk about this forever
I have with my friends I have with
whoever because I find it so interesting
and I'm someone who stinks a lot I
overthink which sucks like sucks but I
also think a lot about just charlie like
dissect situations right so what I was
thinking about how when people hit a
certain amount of subs people tend to
think they've changed the money gets to
their head the subs get to their head
everything like that one you will never
see that with me I care about you guys
more than the money more than the views
more than anything you guys are my heart
and soul and I want you to know that but
what I've noticed is yes I do see a lot
of people when they hit a big enough
subscriber count or you count or
whatever is they kind of start to get a
little more like cocky but I've been
thinking about recently and in the past
month I put my guard up so freaking high
because I was like already feeling bad
enough right now I'm not going to let
anyone else hurt me I'm just going to
shut everyone out which is what I did on
YouTube because I just couldn't hear the
feedback you know I just needed to just
focus on myself for a little bit so I
kind of ended up shutting out some
friends which I've been mending now I
cannot explain it I just laying in bed
was like all I wanted to do I just
didn't want to let myself get hurt and I
think there's like two ways people deal
with that one
they shut people out or two they put up
this kind of persona that's like I think
I'm a I'm Teleca like no one can
mess with me whatever yes they could
easily still be hurting and still have
so many emotions but they like to put
that persona up so no one can kind of
hurt them or s with them or whatever you
do don't saying I could be so wrong
about this that was just a little thing
about change and whatever I think a lot
of it is emotional changes people and
not just like I'm going to let the money
get to my head I think there are people
don't like that but I think it's also
important to know that YouTube and
social media and whoever factors
whatever it's a lot of pressure for an
individual to get all this feedback from
people they have never met
and anyone can comment anything they
want and I think that sometimes it's
really hard to accept that I think
that's where a lot of people disable
comments once you start growing more the
feedback gets more like you get more
feedback and more of it turns in hey I
just also went on YouTube you kind of
want to feel like good about yourself
and ok with yourself before you portray
portrait picture whoo before you portray
yourself to like the whole whoever can
watch your videos you know you would
rather watch these videos and be like I
liked my hair in this I like this and
that actually talks instead of like
dishing on yourself because then the
hate comments are going to mean more to
you because you agree with them does
that make sense I love that make sense
and he is never going to like mean as
much to me as all the love you guys give
me it just means the world and I always
try to focus on all the positive
comments and everything like that
because you guys are my loyal real ones
I love you but the hate can just zap off
like from what I'll never leave in a
comment I will never do whatever this is
like what's the point spread love like
everyone's going through them stuff
right now or has been or will be so just
spread love that's like the best thing
you can do you know I've been taking off
steps to just really care for myself I'm
someone who cares a lot like I think
that's also probably one of my problems
I just care too much right so I end up
getting hurt a lot of the time because I
care too much and I just kind of need to
like let myself be if I have a friend
that I really care about and they end up
just using me or they end up just
whatever I like it's going to hurt more
because I really care about the things
that are very important in my life I
just I care about my youtube more than
you know I care about you guys more than
you will ever know my family my friends
whoever that's just a toll on me
sometimes because I can't please
everyone right I know it but it hasn't
really sunk it in because sometimes I'm
like I can try to please as many people
as a little bit like Brooke you can't
this is going to be such a rambling rant
video I'm sorry you guys know me I
ramble i rant whatever I also wanted to
address a couple other things if you
guys have been on my channel for a while
than you know that I was like insanely
healthy right I worked out like every
day I ate like almost 2 lb to the point
where I lost a lot a lot a lot of weight
and I know when you watch me on camera
and you see here up it looks normal and
you guys are really used to that because
you guys are watching my video
for so long where I had a hollowed-out
face and I was insane jawline and I've
been seeing a lot of comments recently
saying like Mel look fat Mel looks like
she gained weight whatever whatever
mouth like a pig but it's like you
literally see here up right unless I do
like a napkin video or something and yes
I did gain weight but the reason I
didn't do it is because I was
underweight I did not mean for that to
happen I just got on such a health grind
all my friends all my family whatever
say I look a lot healthier now and I am
I'm a good weight for my height but like
I can't even watch my health videos I
just look so so skinny I don't know why
it took me so long to realize that it
wasn't healthy but I really just wanted
to clear that out because I've been
seeing a lot of comments about it but
yes I gained weight but it was a good
way it was healthy weight so that was
just that I felt like that was really
important to address I had so much I
wanted to talk about but I actually feel
a lot better right now just sitting in
front of the camera because I feel like
I'm like with you guys again
and it makes me really really crazily
happy YouTube is one of my biggest
what's the word one of my biggest well
you should make really happy that's I'm
trying to say one of my biggest things
in my life that makes me so extremely
happy I would not give it up for the
world I mean unless the world was gonna
like end and all of that was on my
shoulders like dad being 10 I just
really want to get back on the grind in
a way it was kind of like it twisted
like lose-lose for me because YouTube
makes me really happy yet I felt like I
couldn't do it 92 TMI celebrate but I
was like I want to do it makes myself
happy when my body was like nah Encarta
spleen I don't make sense at the time
when I talk I'm gonna be honest I hope
you got a point of this message but be
ready for hella videos better content I
really just want to focus on my youtube
just make my videos better and I think
for the summer I'm going to really try
to focus on it as well I just want to
put my little heart into YouTube because
it's my dream come true I hope this
video gave you a little idea of what I
was going through just thank you for
being patient with me and thank you for
being loyal and sticking with me through
this it means the world to have you guys
risked me and to have your constant love
and support I can't explain how much it
means to me I know this is kind of a
cheesy video and kind of like a what are
you talking about Mel's video if you get
the gist
I went through some the
immunization hopefully you'll get better
I don't want to complain about my life
and whatever cuz I have an insanely
blessed life I don't it's just been
weird it's almost like when you have
anxiety and depression it like takes
over you and you don't even feel like
yourself and like where am i bro like
come back you know yeah but that's
pretty much all for this video comment
