aware this set up is pretty rough I love
my feet in my house and all I want is to
be able to film in front of it and show
you guys but it was super overexposed
I'm gonna see if I can figure out
everything but me I thought I can either
film on a wall and your facial opponent
but then the wall would be boring just
like the lighting gonna be good
4x boom here my face to look egg and the
backgrounds to look cool but the
background doesn't even look that cool
so like hey I need to figure out the
right background or I need to make a
background the backgrounds I have her
just so boring so sick of that as you
can tell I'm sitting down in a hoodie
what which means it's a chill video Q&amp;amp;A
type catch-up high-ranked video I like
to Ray I'm a rancher I don't know where
I'm gonna start in this video I guess I
want to dust my channel overall and also
from this job is shiny thank you must
breathe down the bouquet site here bring
it here
I guess I just kind of want to start
with a dressing mic change because a lot
of my comments have been filled with and
this old man whistle Mel things like
that I tweeted out from you guys to ask
me questions for this video there's a
couple questions relating to this topic
but I just really really quickly before
we get into this video just because I
feel like in a way I feel you're or you
guys an explanation but I also don't
just because I used to be someone who
would explain everything I would let
people's opinions get to me and like I
would take it personally I'm not like
that anymore I just want to say we're
not even the same person I have the same
heart I'm still Melanie joy yes I dyed
my hair
style changed up but that just goes was
growing up and changing and you're not
gonna do the same personal life I guess
I've also just been a little lost about
my channel because I just I'm gonna talk
about this later
there's just a lot about social media
that has changed those ears and has also
changed my opinion on it and things like
that so yes we're going to talk about
all that in a little bit but I just
wanted to say that I love you guys and I
never mean to act different
intentionally I'm just doing me at all
times as I grow up I'm so gonna stay
true who I am I'm not gonna let anyone
change that and influence Who I am I
guess and I used to be really good at
letting people influence me and having
them just dictate who I am as a person
and now I'm just like know what I think
is what matters
Travis Pamunkey Travis is really one
right since and right now I'd always say
it in the wrong way or anything I guess
to put it in words I just grow into
myself I understand more about life and
day to day life and relationships and
people and things like that we are just
I feel a lot more wise I just want you
guys to know that if anything I've
changed a community I've changed for the
good for myself at least which I think
in the end is what matters and if you're
doing you and you like it you love
and whether Waldron is whoever is
supporting you for that reason and
because you're doing you are your real
supporter so in the end yes I change I
want you to know that I feel better with
this change best person I just feel
better I'm not doing anything
intentionally to make anyone mad piss
anyone off whatever like I'm just doing
me like I just want you guys to
understand that I really just needed to
say that because I feel like people have
almost been looking at me differently
like I just never want my supporters to
look at me differently because of how I
dress you know I do my makeup or
whatever really just bothers what's
underneath everyone's too caught up in
how people look on the outside these
days everyone just needs to focus on the
heart I don't even know if they're arts
and asking people in the world at this
point it would that's where I'm at I
guess I've just seen the love for life I
have to pay taxes I have to do dolt inch
things and I feel like it grow up really
fast for my age and that's probably why
everyone's like oh my god but like I had
to adjust my situation and like the way
I had to just is the way that was gonna
make me feel my best uh whatever I'm
saying is making sense I'm not asking
for your pity I'm not saying sorry I'm
not whatever I'm just letting you know
that I'm still Mel and I think people
should really stop getting caught up in
other people if you're happy with you
you'll be happy with everyone else if
you're like me any comment on my video
you should click off my video and go
figure out what's going on in your life
that makes you want to stay any comment
on my video that's just my opinion and
other times on the way and address you
can get in to the questions I'm gonna
try to be a lot more active on YouTube I
want to start posting twice a week again
we still do content I want to do but
also something that you love us want to
see you but yeah that's already rant my
goal in this video was like to rant so
like we did it we did that so this is a
really good question what's the worst
thing about being on social media is to
learn how do you feel about what YouTube
has turned into I'm not as person so I'm
going to be honest I love social media I
love YouTube so leads for you guys and
the fact that I've had you guys and
whatever been like it's just it means
the world to me like guys are my best
friends
I mean instead ask if I wasn't an
influencer and I just went on social
media everyday a film on social media I
don't know where I would be at as a
person in this life I see on behind the
scenes so I know it's going on you know
I know people are planning I can see
photo and know like what went into it or
likes videos and beef I've seen it I've
seen her behind the scenes honey and I
finished I wish oh my god I could just
show you guys to just put on the
internet but I have a lot of issues with
a lot of creators I guess I say from my
point of view like I don't social media
because I feel like I know what's going
on so I can stand to like not compare
myself to people things like that
because I know a lot of this a lot of
supporters don't and that is just what
scares me and that's why I'm gonna try
to do all I can to keep it real with you
guys you guys probably know it I live in
the Bay I know
live in LA where most influencers are I
don't really like the water youtubers
just because I prefer to stay in the
main you do with my friends who are high
school you know things like that and I'm
moving at a later but I didn't want to
force that lifestyle upon myself just
because I know how toxic it is or how
toxic it can be just because social
media like you never know what's gonna
happen if someone wants to use you
someone wants to just your friend or
suppose you who don't know it's a
competition people want the most
subscribers people want the most views
people want the most
and personally for me I don't care about
that stuff but that is not a common
opinion it's really not I'm gonna make a
difference that's why I'm doing I'm
doing I want to help people and this is
really oh nothing again so dude it's
changed so much youtube let me just say
okay YouTube used to do such a low key
place but anyone could upload a video
there's like I don't have any hours or
whatever uploaded to YouTube every
second it's just crazy
I don't I don't know you're like it's a
TV platform in a way you know like a lot
of celebrities you know you can like
pour it on Disney Channel back of the
day like I've started YouTube things
like that for me I'm going to be honest
I feel like I had a mini heart break
when it came to my youtube channel
because I had to have the realization
that it wasn't just a hobby and making
videos was so fun for me and it still is
right but it's different because I have
to think more about it because it's now
a business if people can attack you in
Langevin start beat than whatever I
guess I just remember I was absent on
social media I just feel like that we
need somehow dealing with knowing that I
had to you know continue with it just
because I like this is what I do
blanket I want to keep doing it but I
want to do it in a way that I am genuine
NIV and I'm not succumbing to all the
social media talked cygnus I'm gonna cut
my hands raw because I'm katalk for
years about this like yeah I'd say
that's one of the worst things I I don't
know I just there's a lot to it there's
a lot of social media that a lot of
people don't think about until you see
it and you're like what's the most
rewarding thing from gaining a following
/w channel I love you and I miss you I
love you and I miss you too that is such
a good question I would say personally
personally I would say the most rural I
get triggered ah I offered for set think
the most rewarding thing is you guys
having you guys come up to me and asking
for four aha you're just talking to me
or you know telling me that I helped you
through depression or whatever that oh
my god
like that's the reward me it makes all
the social media toxic minutes and you
know fakeness it makes it worth it if I
didn't pay attention you guys and you
guys were just like my fans I would not
be doing this I wouldn't want to be
doing this just because I think a lot of
people have the mindset that the reward
in YouTube and social media is money and
fame and love a blog and I personally I
talk about money and bank and all that
stuff all day because I don't think it
creates anything for anyone I don't
think it helps a person I don't know I'm
gonna be honest I guess it will help
them financially about them whatever but
I think a lot of people focus on you
know getting a lot of money and having
the coolest clothes and whatever that
once they get there and they're gonna
realize that money objects it doesn't
mean like it means nothing and I've
gotten there I've got to the point my
 my dream car you know I love my
house
my sound coffee is any way shape or form
ever - you guys just bragging about what
I have because you're the reason I'm
here money you know getting a house
getting my dream car whatever it didn't
fill any void or whatever for me it was
temporary happiness I am so grateful for
my position you know have being able to
buy stuff when I need it and pay rent
and things like that but I think people
get too caught up in it and I think I
got too caught up in it for a second
earlier maybe to life and I realized
that all I want in life is love and
friends and people that mean something
to me it's just not the same feeling I
went to high school I wasn't grown-up
like in the Fame world it's things like
that playing basketball my friends will
do whatever so I know what it's like to
live that life feel me I just like I saw
my friends this all the time like I want
them to do what they love and not
because society makes them and also
because they need money what matters is
waking up every day and doing what you
love and being with people you love and
money and fame and any of that tonight
it's just out gonna equal - dude it's so
not I don't know the most right thing
for me is you guys I want you to know
that penguins on fake and staged YouTube
videos I get spilled so much tea I
didn't spill buckets of tea but I I want
to get involved drama and ruining
people's lives
no I just go about my life I keep my
mouth shut and I do mean a lot people do
that but I just want you guys to know
that there's a lot of fake and staged
YouTube videos and everything is through
your world I don't
pretty much but just don't believe
everything you see you do have to know
that social media is a business and no
publicity is bad publicity so remember
that babies it actually hurts my heart
to see like a lot of supporters get so
caught up in some drama that's not even
real like it's not real but if that's
the creator's choice and that's what
they want to do then you do I just don't
agree with it but we don't have to be
gonna use a tool if I ever staged beef
on social media that's when I'm gonna
quit because that's what I know that
fame and money has gone to my head and
I'm good yeah no no no I don't get
involved in Java this is so bad okay any
progress on getting another tattoo if
not we will help you out in the comments
and girl I am your tattoos because once
you get a tattoo you want more I mean
maybe it's just me ever since I got my
few tattoos I don't worry about like its
leaves or anything yeah I do want you to
touch it what revolt on you guys and I
treated about this but let me know in
the comments what I should get I'm
thinking maybe the date I started my
youtube or I posted my first video or
like a symbol or like yeah one below you
doesn't want to get something in honor
because because I wanted a family on me
whatever limited
we do miss being a kid of course I'm
just being a kid I mean there's so many
things you don't worry about you don't
think about anything don't even know
about like I didn't know about school
shootings when I was five I honestly
think around that pace is really big
toll on your heart I'm not kidding and I
know why I don't know why I wish because
all the kids fertilize in a way that we
all just get given dollars and I'm just
like yeah let me know why guys are dumb
I don't think what you're saying boys
are very smart but when it comes to
females yeah actually
boys let me know down below well how do
you feel about people close to you using
you or not being satisfied with what you
can give to them well I'll be honest um
I've been used a lot I hate it
oh there's no way to not sound cocky
when I talk about this I hate it I don't
know I guess I just have a platform shot
you got shot out
thank you blessed I bless it's really
easy for people to use people like me
you know if anyone wants me sometimes
and they started raspy where they
started a clothing line or whatever it's
easy made me up and say hey let's get
this going and I'm like I'm everyone's I
do resent it I'll support Maryland so
the day I guy no till not
Orion's belt watching over them being
like hey I love you guys like I'll be
there yeah but when it comes to the
people who use me I've gotten so just
done with dealing with people who don't
have the right intentions
you just cut them off it's like if
they're not making good impact on my
life and they're taking from me or like
making me feel sad or whatever like why
are they there I just realize that life
is for you why are you letting people
watch that up song here okay what I
didn't have my if you guys back weird
wow that felt weird so someone says how
do you find true friends and get rid of
the fake ones honey that is a great
question and I feel like I've been
preaching how to give her the fake
friends for so long
well honestly back in the day I don't
even know yeah I feel like I did I did
know then I guess after I've been
through high school and also senior year
lemon just say wow friends
switch up I know what it is but I'm just
a junior senior you're like that's when
you're really determined with you don't
kick away you see a lot of tripped on
liars
I need the amount of comments I've seen
this year is crazy but true comes true
 colors so I was just say
the people who want prioritize you care
about you like see what you call and you
wanna kinda having a hard time I need
you if you don't do a rush over there
your real ones so people are like oh
sorry how do you go to like they don't
care about your well-being many for me I
realized that a lot of people choose
between friends and whatever
and like fun you know go I'm a party
you're like doing this like what would
be more fun in the moment you know a lot
of people just think about that instead
of if someone's going through something
especially people don't have to pressure
anxiety whatever then they have friends
who deal with it they're not gonna
understand I guess I really found
everyone's just talking to people
literally like communication like it's
so key and it sounds so simple I know
talk to your friends but like know about
everything you'll find that but it takes
time and also teenage years you don't
even know if those New York friends like
it it's hard because life is so long and
I really high school whether you're in
it is doing it your whole life but it's
not and I want you guys to know that
it's really not I feel like people who
prioritize these people who want to see
you the weapons be a banner and I've
been the friend of hers more than people
care about me you feel me um and that's
also really toxic and I feel like that's
a situation you should cut that off it
just takes too much out of you or if
you're not like into cutting people off
just give the energy to them that they
get to you don't know over don't the
wind and just give back what they give
to you Jimmy it's all just you know you
want to be treated the Golden Rule
I grew up a bag and let's go visit strip
just treat other people what is it piÃ±on
on drama YouTube channels p.m. and then
you meet in NW to drama channels
that's just goes along side what stage
what's not what's whatever so just be
aware of it you don't get too caught up
in it I just want you guys to know that
like I feel like almost in a weird way
social media isn't a big high school
it's a huge high school there's like
drama there's whatever people think you
can break up a lot everyone's like keep
up with it but I would just to know that
like all that really matters is it's not
a bad thing put your phone down and go
do things and just take some time off
line because it's not the whole world
it's not
the world it's nothing like the real
world there we go it's really not I
sometimes get too caught up in social
media and expend so much time on it so I
have to you know put my phone down and
we'll see in the world go run errands
you know both see people walking pretty
sure to see the real world I don't know
like it sounds so weird like social
media is like taking over I have a lot
of footage and I rent it for a very long
time
I don't know it's made sense and I'm
hoping it does I'm gonna start doing a
lot more chill videos like this because
yes no I've always loved them sometimes
I don't wanna know about a phrase but I
want to say and that's been me in the
past couple of weeks and I feel like I
finally not going to say it so I love
you guys so infinity and beyond
I mean it when I see it and I hope you
know that I really do from the bottom up
or so I hope you guys are doing awesome
genuinely and it's just know if you've
got no chairs I care
cuz I'm your meat so long guys and make
sure to love yourselves as much as I
love you that was cheesy but it's true I
will hopefully see your musical faces in
