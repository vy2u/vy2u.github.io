school in three weeks and so I wanted to
sit down and do kind of a reflection
video and telling you guys ten things
that I learned from high school I've
done a lot of advice videos over the
years on high school but I really just
wanted to tell you guys my experience
and I really hope you guys get a couple
of nuggets of knowledge from this video
number one not everyone is going to like
you and that's okay that's all right
you're gonna find the people that truly
want to be with you and that truly make
you happy and you don't have to be
friends with everyone
it doesn't make you less of a person
everyone is different and everyone has
different preferences when it comes to
who they want to be friends with and
that's alright that's life and that's a
good lesson to learn early on because
you don't have to be liked by everyone
and it's not the end of the world
number two you were going to change a
lot if I look back at my freshman year
self and my videos and pictures I can
just see how much of a different person
I was so so different I was a lot
quieter
I was super embarrassed about my channel
I was so inexperienced when it came to
just like life in general I've
definitely made a whole 180 and the kind
of person that I am for freshman year
and that's a good thing
change is good I was watching Brooke
Machias video and she's talking about
how yeah I've changed a lot but that's a
good thing that's part of the reason why
I want to go to New York and I want to
go to school because I thrive on change
and I think change is so valuable in
shaping your character and so don't
expect to be the same person that you
were freshman year because I can truly
tell you no one is number three you're
going to find the things that really
interest you I remember in freshman year
I was involved in theater and I was
super into drill team and I danced a lot
and that was like my thing but now I
know about making videos is my thing and
I enjoy this and I think it's valuable
when you find something that you enjoy
doing and you just wholeheartedly
embrace it and you don't do it in a
lukewarm fashion but you love it and you
do it if you're going into high school
just know you're gonna find the things
that you love to do it takes some people
longer than others
okay number four if there's more than
one way to live your life I feel like in
high school a lot of people think that
you just have to party and drink and do
all these other things to have fun and
that's so not true yeah that's how you
want to have fun than you do that but
there's also a lot of other ways to have
fun and there's also a lot of other ways
to live your life I feel like people
think that it's weird that I do YouTube
and it's weird that I don't go to
parties and it's weird that I don't like
being around huge crowds of people but
that's okay there's not one way that you
have to do your life you don't have to
go through high school and go to college
and get a job and get married you know
there's other things that you can do and
that's the beauty of the world that's
what makes the world go around that we
are all different people and that we all
live our lives differently you can learn
a lot about hard work if you let
yourself learn I cultivated such a
strong work ethic throughout high school
and that's something that I'm very very
thing before because going into college
I don't have to necessarily like change
into a person who works really hard
because I already am that kind of person
I already balance YouTube and drill
teams and friends and schoolwork and AP
classes and all that good stuff you know
I have that down because of high school
not saying college isn't going to be
harder because trust me I know it is but
you may think in high school that it's
cool to slack off and not do anything
but trust me it's gonna bite you in the
butt whatever you try to apply to
colleges and they look at those classes
and they're like you did not try it all
freedom is a good thing but it can be
easily abused know your limits know what
you can take and don't necessarily put
yourself on a path that's going to lead
to something destructive for me freedom
is what made me cultivate my youtube
channel and cultivate all the beauty
that came with that so I don't want to
sit here and say Oh freedom's a bad
thing because it's not but I do think in
high school that people could take
advantage of it
and use it to a good degree that's not
necessarily meant to be your vibe
attracts your tribe this is so cheesy
but this saying is so true if you're the
kind of person that is negative all the
time and that complains a lot and it's
just or mad at the world you're gonna
attract people that are like that and
honestly you're gonna look back and be
like why did I bake these friends who I
don't even enjoy being around yeah
positive light to other people and trust
me you're going to be able to make
friends just be a nice person and you're
gonna get nice friends in the end number
eight don't be afraid to speak up I've
always been kind
a more quiet person and so this is one
that I struggled with just in class and
stuff someone would say something that I
really disagreed with so I just sit
there and be like wow I really disagree
with that but I would avoid smile if you
have an opinion and you have sound
evidence on why you believe your opinion
is right say it you can't lose anything
from that being able to develop a good
argument is so important just for life
in general and so don't be afraid to
share your opinions and share you know
wise words from yourself because in the
end you're gonna regret not doing that
don't take yourself too seriously
high school is high school and well when
you're in it it may seem like oh this is
my life it's not it's literally just
high school and so if you have drama
with your friends get over it forgive
and forget because life's too short to
hold grudges it's high school have fun
and just let loose it's only four years
of your life and so make this four years
count but in the end there's more to
life than high school I feel like my
senior year of high school I've really
grown up and just realized wow high
school was done my thing anymore and
I've been working on stuff outside of it
and that's okay I feel like you can kind
of be put down for not being so involved
in school whatever reality there's so
much more outside of high school just
don't get so caught up into things and
so worried about things in high school
because honestly there's life outside of
high school and I am really really
excited to embark on it in a few months
here so those are all the things that
I've learned in high school if you are
going into high school you know let me
know what you're concerned about let me
know your worries if you've gotten out
of high school let me know what your
experience was because honestly I would
love to hear you guys's opinions because
opinions Braque you have a good word to
speak speak it you should also go watch

video where I literally filmed my entire
day I put it together and I put some
music on it and that was that so
definitely subscribe if you like my
videos follow me on Twitter and
