to be showing you guys 10 things that
you need for back-to-school season so
these are kind of my back-to-school
essentials and just what I really liked
whenever I was in grade school I also
want to note that this is not a hickey
if you're wondering this is from burning
my neck on my straightener really really
bad and actually hurts a lot so you
should have ly subscribe to my channel
as well I upload twice a week and if you
enjoyed this video I think you will
enjoy my other ones so simply check that
out and let's just go ahead and get into
the essentials so I press this central
would definitely be just a big calendar
I love to hang up one of these on my
wall because I put everything on here
and it keeps me organized and I don't
have any like mishap or I don't forget
any of my deadlines I just I really like
this for visualizing everything it's a
definitely a visual person and yeah this
one's from Walmart if you're wondering
well mark calendars are super cheap if
you're interested in so I really like
this one and I'd highly recommend having
one of these in your room or maybe
whenever I would have kind of some spare
time in school I really liked having
things to read so if two books here this
first one is called how to be a
wildflower and honestly just has really
pretty like quotes and pictures it's
more just kind of whenever you need to
like relax I think this book is really
good I also have Ernest Hemingway's The
Sun Also Rises I read this one back in
July and I really enjoyed it
so I totally recommend bringing some
books I know a lot of times I would just
go on my phone but I think that reading
can be a lot more beneficial and you can
always learn something I'd also
recommend having a planner this is a
2016-2017 one and actually giving this
away in my school supplies haul so if
you want to check it out it'll be linked
down below but it's really pretty and
it's blue and green and obviously having
a planner is really essential because
even though I have a calendar I think
just having this on the go is great swim
was pretty cheap because I know a lot of
planners now are like $60 so Erica I'm
just having a little one to stick in
your backpack I also enjoyed having it
just some really good pens these are my
favorite ones they're just the marker
pens from Paper Mate they've really
pretty colors I love taking notes with
these for some reason it was just very
different whenever
use these everything just looked so much
better and makes taking notes a little
more fun because I know it's not always
the most enjoyable thing but and make it
better go
so my next essential I feel like I've
showed in like every back-to-school
video but I love my All Whites
high-top converse I feel like you can
throw these on with jeans or a t-shirt
dress you just look really cute like
sporty and I just think they're the
epitome of school and so I definitely
recommend having just a good pair of
sneakers to throw on because you'll be
walking to class and you want to be
comfortable so these are my favourites
they're just all white converse and I
highly recommend getting some so my
school would always be super duper cold
and so I literally always had a very
comfortable cardigan to throw on this
was from Madewell it's like a salt and
pepper kind of one I just think it is so
pretty and it was awesome for just like
throwing on over something because I
would get so cold in class and it would
be so hard to focus cuz I'd be like
freaking out about how cold I was and so
I think just having a nice cardigan is
great because the weather always changed
so for me wearing t-shirt dresses was
always so much more comfortable than
wearing pants and so I love this one
it's from Brady Melville just black and
white stripe SuperDuper cute but again I
can just throw this on some sandals and
I'd be so comfortable but it'd be so
easy in the morning for when I was
running late or just didn't know what to
wear it so I think t-shirt dresses are
great a house of my favorite ones link
down below but the brandy melville ones
are always very soft and comfortable but
they can be a little bit short so you
just have to make sure they fit well but
I love mine and I wear these all the
time I think with bed so some mornings I
would be running late and I wouldn't
have enough time to like actually put
all my perfume I would just totally
forget about it and so I highly
recommend just getting a nice portable
one this one is from scent bird which is
a really really awesome subscription
service I'm not like being sponsored or
anything in the past I have been but I
just always use it because I love it and
it comes
nice little travel-size you can stick
this in your backpack and whenever you
have like gym or something or you're
late you did like remember to put on
your perfume I think this is great
because it's travel size and it always
worked and my last essential will
definitely be my very big Madewell purse
I know some of you guys might prefer
backpacks which I actually do but I just
kind of switched over to this bag for
college next year but it's just a really
big gray vade world bag but this is
great to throw in some notebooks your
laptop you know whatever you need and I
also like that it has a nice crossbody
strap and it matches with everything and
so I love this purse but I think just
having a nice sturdy school bag to last
you the whole year is really really
great because you don't want it to be
like falling apart and breaking all the
times that's so fun so those are all my
essentials for back-to-school let me
know what you guys use the most for
back-to-school season because I'm going
to be picking up my college stuff and I
definitely would like to know also make
sure to go follow me on Instagram and
Twitter it'll be linked right here

probably going to be moving and it's
going to be exciting so if you want to
join me on this journey definitely go

last back-to-school video which will be

hope you guys enjoy it and I love you
