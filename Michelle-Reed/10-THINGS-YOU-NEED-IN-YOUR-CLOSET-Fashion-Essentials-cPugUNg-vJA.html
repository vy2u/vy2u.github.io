a video on my top 10 wardrobe essentials
or what I think that everyone needs in
their closet obviously what I think
other people need is going to be
different than what some other people
think they need so take this lightly
don't think too much into it these are
just kind of the essentials that I wear
every day and if you're looking to build
a better wardrobe I think these are the
pieces that you should have I'm also
gonna model the clothes somewhere in
this I'm not exactly sure how I'm gonna
do that yet but just so you can see that
these is on and I also think I'm going
to style them so I'm not just gonna like
show you guys what they look like I'm
gonna show you what other pieces I would
put with it to show that it's essential
what not if you're new to my channel
definitely subscribe I upload once or
twice a week and I make beauty fashion
and lifestyle videos so I think that
would be a lot of fun if you stayed and
with all that being said we're just
gonna go ahead and get into the video so
first essential I think is the most
important thing that you need to have
and that is a pair of black high waisted
skinny jeans guys I think I live in
these pants I wear these probably every
single day these are the bdg ones from
Urban Outfitters I love these I love how
they fit I love how they wear they're
just really really good jeans a match
with absolutely everything and black
jeans are so slimming on and they look
good with pretty much any shoes so I
definitely think everyone should have a
pair of these black jeans just look good
on everybody and if they're high-waisted
they really hold everything together
they make you look good
the next essential I have is a recent
essential that is a pair of black
booties I absolutely love black booties
again they match with everything and
they just make everything look a little
more sophisticated so if you're trying
to kind of upgrade it out that I think
black booties are the way to go these
ones are from Ralph Lauren or they're
lauren by Ralph Lauren so those like
this they have some buckles on the sides
which I like I like the silver detailing
on them but so simple but they just add
so much to every single outfit and I
find myself wearing these pretty much
like four or five times a week so I
definitely recommend picking up a pair
of black booties this next essential is
actually from my sisters
closet I'm sorry Lindsey but it is just
a denim vest this one is pretty distress
which I personally really liked but I
think that these just look so cute you
could throw it done in vest over
anything and it just looks so much more
chic and like kind of Rutger ish and by
courage I don't know what the word is
you're wanting to just kind of amp up an
outfit try denim vest they Rock I
personally really really love this one
but honestly you can find these anywhere
from all different price ranges they're
just so good the sex essential is a
skirt and I think this one some people
might not think is essential but I
really like it this is just a I don't
even know what this fabric is called
it's almost like cable knit but a little
thinner but it's just a long midi skirt
so hits right about your calf muscle
this looks so good it's high-waisted
it's very slimming and if you just tuck
a very simple shirt in you just look
really good and you look like hey she's
got her life together which i think is
always good to have in a piece I really
love this skirt it's from PacSun I have
this in maroon as well just because I
really like it I feel good they're
comfortable and they're just such a
great thing to have in your wardrobe
this next thing is a wool hat I know
we're kind of in spring and summer so
you might not want to wear wool hat but
I still wear them despite the weather I
think these are so nice to have they
just look good on everyone and every
time I'm wearing a hat I feel like I
just have such a good day I just love
how they look especially with straight
hair I don't know why but I just think
hats looks so good with like straight
hair especially short hair my sister has
short hair and she was riding her hat
and she looked so good in it and I just
really really like how these looks so I
wish I could wear these to school but
like it's dress code or whatever but
love these thanks is a pair of shoes
that I recently purchased and I love I'm
obsessed with these especially for the
spring and summer platform sandals I
know they're kind of crazy they're kind
of weird sometimes I get weird looks
when I wear a but I love these so
they're just plain sandals with a
platform basically I like them because
they're like heels but they're platform
so they're so comfortable guys these
feel like I'm walking on foam they're so
awesome
I remember in elementary school all the
moms would always wear platform
flip-flops and they honestly remind me
of these but these ones are from
nice I think they're so chic and cute
and they're really fun to style if you
don't drop them this next piece ignore
the patter but I think is a really
really comfortable romper rompers or so
nice especially for the spring and
summertime because you just throw them
on and they're easy and they're
comfortable here's one that I have from
choice I know has some flowers all over
it I'm not saying you need to have a
sunflower romper I'm just saying a
comfortable romper is always nice to
have this one's just really cute because
it has little pom-poms on it which i
think is a really nice touch I really
like this one it's from choies which is
like a Chinese wholesale shop I'll have
a link down below super cute super
comfortable and I basically live in
these in the summertime this next thing
is also a recent purchase but one I'm so
happy I finally found and that's a maxi
dress if you never find a maxi dresses
that look good on me just because I'm
pretty tall and I have just like a
rectangle body and so I figure a lot of
times maxi dresses just don't give me a
lot of shape and they don't work on my
body but this one is so cute it has a
gray top and then it's just very simple
black all the way down very flowy like a
chiffon material but I am in love with
this it's so simple but guys like the
possibilities with this are endless this
one's from TJ Maxx
I love getting basic pieces from TJ Maxx
just because they're cheap and they're
nice quality they always have Free
People stuff too which is awesome so now
that this is free people I just like
pretty people but super cute and like
the one maxi dress that I found actually
looked good this next piece is probably
the most basic piece in this video but
it is just a plain tight fitted
long-sleeve shirt I think that these are
so nice to have because you can throw a
scarf over it you can put a hat on you
can tuck it into a skirt and it just
looks good so many different ways and so
this one is from brandy melville really
tight and fitted which i think is good
to have because they tuck better in two
skirts and pants they look good they
feel good on your body and so I really
like this one I'd recommend brandy
melville if you're looking for a shirt
like this I know that every time I buy
these I wear them out completely just
because they're so good to have and
they're so easy to stop the last thing I
have to show you guys is an accessory
which I hope is OK
about this video but they are Daniel
Wellington watches no this is not
sponsored
they sent me these a while ago but ever
since then I have worn these every
single day you can ask anyone I
basically wear these watches every day
they're just really really clean it
looks good I'm always the kind of person
that likes to have the time and so these
are really really non pretentious
watches that I just enjoy wearing all
the time and I think anyone from so
those are the fashion essentials that I
have to show you guys I really hope you
guys like this video I've been really
into fashion lately and I want to start
incorporating that more into my channel
just because I'm not really one for like
lifestyle videos anymore I don't like
hack videos I don't like comedy videos
so really not that funny and so I hope
you guys enjoy this because this is more
fun for me if you want to watch my last
video it was my workout routine because
I've recently been working out a lot and
I think it's super important so you
should definitely check that out
and I'll see you guys my next video bye
