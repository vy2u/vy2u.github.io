today I'm going to be doing a 10 things
that you need for fall videos so
basically this is like my back to school
one I did I got a lot of good feedback
on that one so I decided I would do
another one for fall this is my first
fall video so if you have any other
requests for fall themed video simply
leave them down below and don't forget
to subscribe if you aren't already you
can click this button or you can click
down below and I would really appreciate
it but yeah let's just go ahead and get
into the videos and change some perks
we're gonna start off with clothing
essentials first I just have a simple
sweater I think everyone is just a
comfortable
nice sweater to wear this one's actually
from j.crew it's a nice gray shade I got
it a little oversized so it would be
more comfortable because comfort is the
key I really like this one I'd be
definitely put like a flannel underneath
and have it peeking out of the top and
out of the arms so I really like the
sweater I definitely think everyone
needs that one sweater that's like their
go-to sweater you please give us a kiss
berry
then I just have a dress to wear with
tights I think it's really important to
have a dress that does look good with
tights because you don't wanna be cold
showing your legs so I have this one
from Target it is just like this fake
suede material and then it goes down and
has pockets something has pockets I'm
most likely gonna buy it it's also a
good length so I would definitely pair
this with like some maroon tights and
some booties and I think it would be
really cute I am also a fanatic for
scarves I absolutely love them and I
actually really like blanket scarves I
don't have one to show you guys I just
have this chunky one as an example but I
love blanket scarfs and my Catherine
just posted a video and she was wearing
like this plaid colored blanket scarf I
will leave it right here not Lincoln I
will show it right here but I absolutely
loved those they look so comfortable so
I would definitely recommend picking one
of those up I don't have one to show you
guys but they are awesome and I need to
go get one
also all hats are becoming a trend and I
absolutely love them so I definitely
recommend picking one up I'm actually
wearing one right now this one's from
j.crew it's just brown it's actually
like a maroon e brown but sell them at a
lot of store site you can get them cheap
from forever 21 mine was about 25
dollars I think from j.crew so
definitely recommend getting one of
these hats they really spice up any fall
outfit yeah well it might not be cold in
the fall time it still can get chilly so
I recommend having a jacket to throw on
this is my absolute favorite one I've
had this for a couple years now but it's
from choice and it's just a green jacket
and time kind of Navy boy right here and
then it cinches in at the waist which I
love cinching in right there because I
feel like jackets can kind of consume
you and make you look a lot bigger than
you actually are so on something cinches
in at the waist I'm all for it because
it's so much more flattering I always
wear this it literally matches with all
my outfits and it's perfect so I think
everyone should have a good jacket that
just goes with everything
now the next thing I have is definitely
the most support and that would be some
booties I love booties I used to be into
more like riding style boots but lately
I've just been digging these kind I have
this pair from Steve Madden which is
heel and it's almost a little more like
a Western field I love these I've worn
these so often they match with
everything and I think they definitely
dress up any outfit these ones I were
recently got and they're a little more
casual they're from Franco Sarto but
they're just kind of a dark brown color
I haven't seen boots this color before I
think it's a cool grayish Brown they're
really cute and I definitely recommend
picking up some videos because they are
awesome and I own way too many pairs of
booties my favorite makeup products for
fall is definitely a wine colored
lipstick like the one I'm wearing right
now this slug is Bordeaux by Rimmel so
it's a very very deep red almost like a
plug but it looks so pretty on the lips
and I love it I really like black cherry
by Revlon as well but I went to go pick
it up and they were sold out and so this
one was my second option but it works
great and I think
I should know I absolutely adore like a
maroon colored eyeshadow this one is
from my lorac Pro palette and it is this
garnish a it's literally the prettiest
shade ever it's like a shimmery dark
reddish maroon color right here but I
love this I always work this into my
outer corner and I love it for fall it's
like fall and an eyeshadow color if that
could be possible ee-vie garne in the
Loire Valley wow I just don't really
like wearing mauve colored blushes
football I think it's definitely
different than like a bright pink that
you were in the summer
this one is dolce vita dolce vita by
NARS it's just a really pretty mouth
color it has a little bit of shimmer but
you can't really tell on your cheeks it
just gives your cheeks kind of a glow so
so pretty a little expensive but it's
definitely worth it because it is so
opaque it shows up so well on your
cheeks and you don't have to use very
much and the last thing is a candle
because with this even via fall
essentials video if I didn't mention a
candles this is warm caramel cider from
Bath and Body Works I have burned so
much of this I need to go pick up
another one I just haven't gotten to it
yet but this one smells amazing
it just smells like apple cider and
caramel mix and it gives you're in such
a cozy feel when you burn it so don't we
recommend getting this candle or
checking out any about the bodyworksball
candles because they are amazing so
those aren't my essentials for fall I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
let me know down below what your number
one item for fall is because I love to
know if you're in the mood for watching
