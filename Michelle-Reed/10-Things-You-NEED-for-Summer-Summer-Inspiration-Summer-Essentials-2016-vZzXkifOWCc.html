sitting down here talking to you guys
today I really just wanted to sit down
and talk today's video is going to be 10
things that you need for the summertime
so these are the things I would consider
my essentials and just the item side I
really like so beauty and fashion and
just kind of random stuff before I start
I wanted to run something by you guys
really quick I have been considering the
starting eight fashion blog online just
strictly fashion not like other kinds of
blogs well you know you guys think I'm
thinking of starting it once I moved out
to New York so if that's something you'd
be interested in definitely let me know
I just have really really gotten into
fashion over the past year and I think
it'd be kind of a cool direction to go
towards it's so do you two think that
just having a blog and running that
would also be super cool and of course
if you're new to my channel and you do
not know who I am my name is Michelle
Reed and I upload videos twice a week
beauty fashion lifestyles so you should
definitely subscribe and it would mean a
lot to me and yeah let's just go ahead
and get into the video
so my first essential for the summer
time would definitely be a subscription
service that I love and it's called
scent bird and basically they send you a
new travel size perfume every month for
$14.95 you come in these super cute
little travel containers I love these
are perfect just to stick in your purse
or like your beach bag or if you're
traveling a lot they're so so good
because you want to bring a whole
perfume you can just bring a small one I
love this company because for me
personally I get tired of scents all the
time and I always want a new scent for
the different seasons because in the
summer time I prefer something that's a
little more fruity and in the winter
time I prefer something that's a little
more vanilla here's something and so
summer it is totally incredible for that
because you can just try out so many
different perfumes and really find the
scent that you like they also have a ton
of quizzes that you can take if you're
not sure like which one works for you
you can take it and see you know maybe
perfumes that you like and they always
have a scent of the month which is super
cool you have about eight millimeters of
perfume inside which is basically the
size of the
actual rollerballs it's not that I
decided to try the East a strong perfume
and black opium it's such a pretty like
vanilla scent and I love it for the
summertime if you're interested in
trying out supper definitely use my
phone I'll put it right here but it gets
you 25% off your first perfume which is
absolutely incredible and I definitely
recommend doing just try me alright next
essential would definitely be just a
little comfortable tanks this is one
that I have for urban and it's so flowy
and great just to wear with high-waisted
pants because it fits really really
nicely and it's super loose I live in
Texas if you don't know and so it's so
hot here and so things like this are so
perfect just throw on and I love my
night to central in general is just
linen linen is so so light for the
summertime but especially like linen
pants these are a pair that I got from
Zara and they're just striped and they
go down to my ankles and they have a
really really cute high-waisted Thai
drawstring I posted a picture of these
on my Instagram if you always check it
out right here it's at Michelle Rhee
definitely follow me on there I post so
often on Instagram but I adore these
pants and I've never seen someone wear
pants like these so my next essential
are off the shoulder tops if you've
never tried these on they are absolutely
beautiful and they're so so flattering
on I really really like this the ruffle
on it is so beautiful and for me
personally I'd like to show off my
collarbones that's probably like my
favorite part of my body and so I think
these are super super great for that and
they're just so summery in so far
- the central is so hard to show on
camera but it's basically just
flattering cropped shirts to tuck into
skirts for me I hate wearing shorts I
only wear skirts on the summer time and
so I love having shirts like these to
put on this one's just black and it
crosses in the front from brandy
melville I love this shirt so much
because it just looks really really good
on and it's also so tight that you don't
really have to wear a bra which is such
a plus right in a couple videos I'm
pretty sure but definitely definitely
want my samples for me in the summertime
I have more time to explore and walk
around so I think it's nice just to have
a good pair of little tennis shoes these
ones are the brand cole haan and they
basically look like oxford shoes but in
tennis uniform which I just think is so
cute and I also got these for New York
just because I assume walking a lot and
I thought these are kind of cuter tennis
shoes because I'm not super into just
like wearing tennis shoes around but I
think these are great especially with
the athleisure trend going on right now
I definitely recommend picking up a good
pair of sneakers my last kind of fashion
favorite would definitely be Ravens I
think it's so important just to have a
really good pair of sunglasses my
boyfriend actually just got me these for
my birthday and I think they're so cute
these ones are just aviators and they're
like the silver lenses with the gold and
matt reins and I just think they're
really really nice and they kind of
matched with all my clothes and they're
kind of like carefree and so I really
like these and I think just having a
nice pair of sunglasses is really really
great I need
for makeup favorites I absolutely adore
highlighting my face for the summertime
I did a little bit more of a highlighted
look today probably can't tell when it's
from hourglass it's the ambient light
palette and my sister's got me this for
my birthday but I love this summertime
it's just so nice to have like a really
fresh glow they'll usually just wear
this with a little bit of powder and
concealer and your skin just looks super
dewy and fresh you throw me I go I use
this foundation in my last makeup
tutorial and I honestly love it so much
it's the boots number 7 airbrush away
foundation and I like this because it's
super super lightweight and it's very
very liquidy and so when you put it on
it's just you don't feel like I'm
wearing so much makeup it just feels so
light and fresh it W recommend this if
you're someone who doesn't need a ton of
coverage I think this is great
it's almost like a tinted moisturizer
which is perfect for summertime and my
last little favorite right here is my
Clinique chubby stick in the shade
roly-poly rosy I love this blush it's
just a really nice cream blush pretty
much it's great for the summer time
because I don't like to wear a lot of
powders because it looks super cakey and
it gets everywhere you sweat it's
disgusting
you watch it they're just so essential
and so nice for your summer makeup
routine and I definitely recommend
picking one out so that is it for my
summer essentials let me know down below
what your number one summer essential is
I'd definitely be interested in knowing
all so make sure to go follow me on
Instagram and Twitter I've been so much
more active on there lately and I think
they're just really cool platform so

sure is a summer night routine so
