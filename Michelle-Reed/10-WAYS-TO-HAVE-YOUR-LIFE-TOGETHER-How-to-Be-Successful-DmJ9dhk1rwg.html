basement of my apartment building
because I may be sharing with you guys
ten ways to get your life together now
I'm in college I'm a freshman in college
and I have been here for about three
months now
and honestly I can tell you that my life
has just gone so so crazy and saying it
has been so much basically these are
just basic tips that helped me they may
be things that you already know but you
don't do all of them if you're new to my
channel you should also subscribe the
buttons right here I upload once a week
and I do beauty fashion and lifestyle
content here on my channel and this is
no heavy get to the video do you know
exactly what you have to do each day and
you have a plan and you already have
that in your mind it makes getting
things done so so much easier is this
something that I have to work on because
I'm always like hey I know I need to do
this but things just slip through the
cracks and then you forget to do things
so get a planner get a calendar and
write down every single thing you have
from you know hey eat lunch clean my
room to do this project write this paper
whatever I'm wearing something I'm just
like yes I love this outfit I feel good
I find that I do have a better day I
know that is extremely materialistic and
superficial but it works and I think
sometimes you just have to do it work if
you're wearing something that you don't
feel comfortable in and you don't feel
confident and you're not going to want
to achieve your goals you're going to
want to go home and change and go to bed
so whenever I'm wearing like heels or
like a nice pair of pants or jacket or
anything like that I always feel so much
more confident and it really helps me in
the long run
breakfast makes such a big difference
guys whatever I eat like oatmeal or
smoothie or something that's a little
bit heavier I always feel so much more
energized for the day so even if you
have to wake up a little bit earlier to
make yourself a good breakfast or you
have to make it the night before eat
breakfast because you honestly have so
much more energy you're gonna want to do
things getting ready and taking a shower
and really working out my makeup is
something that for me personally kind of
energizes me for the morning and I feel
like I can wake up and I have that 20
minutes just to have for myself I really
quickly wanted to mention a brand that I
think is so cool this is not sponsored I
just saw this email my email box and I
was like I need to show this message
because it's so so cool basically it is
a charity outreach company called the
adventure project and what they do is
they try to use jobs and
entrepreneurship to help people get out
of poverty so we're never for most
charity organizations in the fact that
they do value you know creating jobs and
promoting job growth and being
successful and they combat poverty with
that which I just think is so cool
entrepreneurship it's awesome and
incredible it's something that I'm
striving you know to be in that industry
and so whenever I sell this emails like
I have to share this message we're
currently having this super super cool
project or basically if you buy one of
their charcoal soaps they will dedicate
a charcoal efficient stove to a woman in
Kenya she fires actually caused so many
so many deaths in the world and so I
thought it was so cool that adventure
project is using something like soap to
help provide for the woman in Kenya and
charcoal soap is awesome you guys know
that I love my charcoal masks it's so
great for just clearing out your pores
and making sure that you don't have
breakout so if you're interested in
promoting this campaign and actually
purchasing a soap I will have the link
down below you should definitely check
it out
fine whatever I actually have a goal
that I want to reach it makes doing
little activities up so that goes so
much easier so if it's something like
hey I really really want to get this job
I'm going to work hard now in school I'm
going to get good grades I'm going to
study because I know that I want this
specific job if you're just able ously
working hard but you don't have a reason
for it it makes it so so much more
difficult
so maybe just spend time writing down
your goals and writing down what you
want to achieve and that can help you
get that home I feel like before I came
to college I was so bad actually taking
opportunities I got so scared I let fear
hold me back from so much but ever since
moving to college I've just said yes so
many more opportunities I have met so
many cool people which helps a lot with
networking which is so so important it's
not what you know it's who you know to
some degree and so I just think that
saying yes is so important so even if
it's an opportunity that you're like I
really sketch them about this this is a
little bit different that's not my
comfort zone do it you say yes to
everything you are going to overwhelm
yourself I know how this feels guys it
is not fun no but you can you can't do
know how to prioritize know how to say
no I know if you're people pleaser and
you're someone who likes to say yes to
everything this is really really
difficult but for your own sanity and
your own well-being you have to know how
to say no
like I said before you have to know what
you do have time for me you don't have
time for and I do think it's important
to actually write this out and be like
hey this is really important to me I
need to be investing the switch time to
do this thing okay you know this is
really important to me to be investing
this much time into this thing balancing
out your time is so important I don't
think we can ever truly have perfect
impeccable time management skills that
you can get there eventually
number nine is something that is my
personal favorite and I would be to
watch TED talks or sermons or anything
that just uplifts you I find whatever
I'm watching someone who's so passionate
and so successful it makes me want to be
successful I don't think this works for
the long run I do think you have to have
that fire within yourself as well but if
you're just starting out I do think that
that helps have your life together if
you see other people who have their
lives together you need that time to
recharge and regain and get that fire
back within you so if you are feeling
like you're kind of losing that try to
sit back and give yourself time on your
own to do what you need to do to be
creative and to find inspiration so
those are the tips that I have for this
video I really hope this helps you guys
out again if you want to check out the
adventure project it'll be linked down
below such a cool company and I think
just along with this video seeing people
work really hard to help others and be
successful in entrepreneurship and out a
bit really well my social medias will be
links right here if you want to check
them out you should also go watch my
last video was how to always look good
and I will see you guys in my next video
I love you all so much bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
