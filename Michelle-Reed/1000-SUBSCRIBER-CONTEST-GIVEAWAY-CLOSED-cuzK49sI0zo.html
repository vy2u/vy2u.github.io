makeup tutorial fall nail tutorial fall
lookbook full outfit of the day doesn't

sorry about that coffee break now on to

when you open it up there's all of the
little prizes and the insides pink so
yeah but there's all the prizes the
first and biggest thing you're gonna win
is a pallet this is the two faced
natural eye palette I love this way
better than the Naked palette it's my
all time favorite palette I just love it
so it just has really pretty shimmery
and matte shades it has like three matte
shades on the top and then six shimmery
shades on the bottom and I love them
like this color on my lid this in the
crease in this in the outer corner and I
love it's like my everyday makeup
routine it also comes with a little
sample of Too Faced shadow insurance so
that's cool next you're gonna win the

really bright but you're gonna win two
of these mac products first one is a
lipstick and this is a glaze and it's in
the shade Hugh I don't have this but I
want this guy's really pretty like baby
pink nude color so pretty I heard these
like smell like vanilla so you also want
a nice shadow and if I didn't know I was
gonna get this a probably would've got
this i would have gotten like blush or
something so I'm sorry it's in the shade
all that glitters and it's avelox pearl
and it's like a shimmery peachy pink
color it's really similar to the one in
the palette so I'm sorry but I mean
