fun part I'm gonna talk about prizes um
I asked on Twitter wait palette you guys
would want to win and a lot of people
send the naked too but I was like nah I
kind of wanted to do some kind of spring
theme of how you're gonna win is the
selah in the garden palette I saw art
and rose all this and so when I went to
Alta I found those smells like this is
so pretty and I really love it so this
is what it looks like there's the name
of all of the colors in the palette so
you get a little like I book with all of
like the eyeshadows and such in it yours
actual palette it's so pretty it's so
cute and I love it I'm trying to be
really careful I'm so all of these
gorgeous eyeshadows some of them are
neutral and some are colorful I just
thought it looked so springy I mean
the bully one looks so gorgeous you're
also gonna win this tart little lip
product I have no idea what this is
called but it looks like this I just
thought it was really pretty and kind of
floral it's in the shade adore adored
but it's like I think a lip gloss and
like a lip stain and one or something
like that but I just thought the
packaging was really really cute I don't
want to open its I don't want to mess it
up but that's what it looks like if
you're wondering you're also gonna win
two of my favorite favorite nail
polishes and they just happen to be
spring colors I'm the first one is Fiji
literally the perfect baby pink it only
takes a couple coats and it looks really
opaque and this is like my all-time
favorite nail polish and I adore it so
much also gonna win mint candy apple
which again is another one of my
favorite favorite nail polishes but it's
just a mate green and it's so pretty
like how can you resist this now the
next few things you're gonna win are
kind of cool because I actually made
these things they are hairbow got this
idea off of Matt proper your sevens
video and I made them and I love them I
wear them a lot and so I decided to just
make some and give them away for you
guys so you're gonna win i think eight
bows is how many there are but they all
look like this and i kind of
personalized because i made them so i
think that's kind of cool I want to say
the back does have glue on it if you can
see so that's gonna like weird you out
you don't have to enter this but it does
have like hot glue on the back I'm just
gonna tell you guys that so the first
one is just this mustard colored one
it's super duper pretty you also win
this kind of baby pink one I love this I
actually had an Instagram picture with
the one similar to this you will win a
chevron one a nude colored one this kind
of like army green colored one this
one's really thick and I think it's
really really pretty and I like blue and
white floral one this one is super Hardy
I feel like it's really awesome for
spring but it's just a total floral bow
this is the last one it's also my
favorite it's kind of like a twat
pattern it's so pretty in classy you're
also going to want a little note for me
I haven't wrote it yet because I want it
to be kind of personal to the person who
wins that counts towards anything you

everything you're going to win and so

thing about spring in the downbar so
