about my back to school essential slash
obsession so what I have to have for
back-to-school and what I found myself
using the most these aren't like the
cute do-it-yourself you know that kind
of stuff it's literally what I use for
beauty and fashion to school supplies
and then just random stuff so yeah this
is a cloud with book michiyo on youtube
so i will have her video linked right
here she's doing a current obsessions
video and it also be linked down below
you should definitely subscribe to her
she's awesome and I get a lot that we
look like twins so if you want to see my
twin go check out her channel and if you
happen to be from her channel you should
definitely subscribe right now I bled
every Sunday and Thursday and I do kind
of the same sorta video Sheena's so yep
with all that said we're just going to
go ahead and get into the video you know
so I 15 things to show you guys and I'm
going to start off with the beauty and
fashion stuff and then go into the
random stuff towards the end so the
first thing I have is a solid pair of
jeans these are my high-waisted black
jeans from American Eagle I think you
always need like one really cute comfy
pair of jeans that you're just going to
wear a ton during the week and these are
mine I only wear jeans to school so
these are so essential I can't even tell
you guys the second thing is really
comfy t-shirts because I know you will
buy these really cute shirts but let's
be honest you're going to end up wearing
the t-shirts that are the comfiest
here is one that I actually stole for my
sister I'm sorry Lindsey it's just a
plain white with black stripes top and
it has a little black collar this is
from Urban Outfitters I think so you
definitely need to get yourself some
soft t-shirts that are comfy personal
thank you
now I don't really wear dresses to
school but when I do I will only wear
them if they are super comfortable and
like t-shirt dresses so I really like
this one that is maroon and it is so
flowy doesn't really flatter me that
much but it is so comfortable and it's a
lot more comfortable than wearing pants
so I definitely recommend getting a
really comfy dress to wear no I don't
know about you guys but my school is
always really cold or it's really hot
there's like no in between and so I
always like to bring a hoodie in case
it's one of the cold days this one is
from brandy melville and it's super
slouchy and soft and it's something that
I can just throw on with any outfit and
it's going to match with everything I
hate sitting in class being all cold
views I'm always freezing and I never
focus whenever I'm cold so Delta
recommend bring me a jacket with you
guys now my school is pretty big and so
I have to walk a lot so sometimes I like
to wear tennis shoes I really wish I had
these like cute little tennis shoes that
were a little more stylish but I just
have my white all bruised but I really
like these they're a lot more
comfortable than a lot of my other shoes
and I usually end up wearing these over
like say a pair of flats or sandals just
because they have nice supports and if
you're walking you'll want to be
comfortable
for makeup products my first one I have
is the Smashbox photo finish primer
water I spray this on my face after I do
my makeup and it keeps my makeup on all
day and it kind of gives a little bit of
a dewy finish which I really like
this up rocks I've use this so much of
it I don't know if you can tell but it
is awesome and I'm kind of dreading
buying another bottle of this because
it's a little expensive but it's so
worth it because it keeps my makeup on
all day and it's great whenever you're
at school for like 7 hours I know if you
guys are anything like me you probably
stay up way too late and then you have
really bad under-eye circles and so this
instant age rewind brightener from
Maybelline is great this is by far the
best under-eye concealer I have ever
used and I love it I use it on my video
so you should definitely check this one
out
I recommend it also I love blushes that
double as both like a blush and a
bronzer because you can just sweep it on
your cheekbones and you look bronzed and
awake and healthy but you don't look
like you've sat there and contoured your
face for 20 minutes because no one has
time for that
this one is my pick seats in the shade
subtly Sun touched I really like it it
just gives your face that natural warmth
that looks really good and really
healthy and so I love this one it's from
the drugstore I definitely recommend
picking it up maybe I'm
if I'm back back I like to keep a little
body spray just so I keep smelling good
and I don't smell bad and so this is one
from pink it is fresh and clean again
this one is my sister's and I stole it
because it smells really good but in my
backpack I'm definitely going to have
one of these convenient and it's fast
and I live
Oh everywhere a of things the first
thing that I have is a planner I
definitely always need a planner because
I like to write out what homework I have
this one is actually from last year but
I haven't ordered myself one this year I
don't know which brand I'm going to go
with you guys should definitely let me
know what planners are the best because
I've heard of a few but I just want to
know definitely I would recommend
picking up a planner they keep you
organized and are perfect for high
school or middle school or college also
to write in my planner in other
notebooks
I love gel pens gel pens Rock the world
they make your handwriting look a lot
better than it actually is which is
great because I really don't like my
handwriting at all it's super messy but
I love these they write really smoothly
and I find that I write more sub down if
I have one of these on hand so
definitely pick yourself up some gel
pens they are awesome I also love myself
some good mechanical pencils because my
school never has pencil sharpener so I
can't even use regular pencils without
them breaking and becoming dulls so I
love mechanical pencils these ones are
easy grip ones I don't really care which
brand I get I just like to have one that
I don't have to sharpen so like these or
recommend mechanical pencil
this is an essential that I hold above
all other essentials in this video and
they are flashcards if you've watched my
videos for a long time you know I
eventually so many times I am an addict
them for everything AP tests just
regular tests quizzes literally
everything I had at school I use
flashcards so definitely recommend these
I like the ones that have the lines on
the back and then they're solid on the
front love these live these be these
arrows this next thing is my aqua burst
water bottle or just any water bottle
because I like to stay hydrated and they
like to have cold water so recommend
getting a water bottle this one is
aquifers so you can actually flavor it
with this I mentioned it and one of my
videos like the how to be productive one
but I really like this and lastly this
is a very simple essential but but
headphones are so important when you are
walking in the halls from class to class
you want to be jamming and you want to
be pumped up so I definitely recommend
getting some headphones to listen to
music you guys all probably have these
but I always forget them so just make
sure they are always in your backpack I
might even buy another pair just to keep
in my backpack because I need these so
those are all of my essentials for
back-to-school I don't really like this
season but it is going to be my senior
year and so I am excited one more year
we got this we can do this if you want
to watch my last back-to-school video it
was a first day of school morning
routine about how to dress yourself what
kind of breakfast to have all that fun
stuff
and I had a really fun time filming that
video so definitely check that one out
and I'll see you guys my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
