dressing like a little girl Joan
Holloway today I will be doing a madmen
or vintage 1960s inspired looks so sit
back and relax and enjoy this video so
like always we will be starting out with
the makeup look and I've already done my
foundation routine which if you want to
see I will link it down below first I
will be filling in my brows with the
benefit brow kit because I feel like
this is always a necessity to define
your face then I'm taking my NYX cream
blush in boho chic peach blush was
really in in the sixties and so I feel
like this blush kind of suits that look
then I'm probably my eyes with my Urban
Decay eyeshadow primer which also acts
as a base it's as a nude color and then
for eyeshadow I'm using my Too Faced
naked palette and taking any kind of
creamy shade and applying that over my
full entire eye and then using pink
cheeks which is kind of just like a
light pink color I'm applying that to my
lid then using kind of a soft gray color
I'm putting that in my crease and then
lastly I just taking kind of a charcoal
gray and putting this in my outer corner
and I lied that's not the last thing now
we're gonna take a black color and put
that in the kind of very very outer
corner and then like always just
blending it all out so there are no
harsh lines and now I'm creating a
winged eyeliner look which I cannot do
on camera so I went to the mirror I know
you're not supposed to pull your eye but
that's literally the only way I can do
it so I'm sorry I know I might get
wrinkles but please still have good
winged eyeliner then I'm applying a
generous amount of my covergirl mascara
and that is the eye look wait one more
step we're gonna take those two dark
colors and apply them to the lower lash
line just to finish it off then using
the clinic lipstick in Merlot I'm a
finest my lips it's a nice berry color
but I used a brush to have a little more
precision and that is it for this very
glamorous makeup look so now we are onto
the very voluminous updo first like
always just brush out your hair and kind
of find your part then gather the
section around the crown of your head
and kind of suction it off from the rest
and then tie it off the other section so
you don't get confused now you are going
to go away like a madwoman and tease
this hair like there is no tomorrow and
then you're gonna kind of gather it all
in just pin it I will recommend pinning
it a lot so it stays and smoothing it
out so it doesn't look like you tease it
which this is kind of hard for me so I
know it is still a little messy but
that's okay then we're brushing out the
other section pulling your bangs back
here spraying them and pinning it as
tight as you can also doing this to the
other side
then we're gonna raid the rest of the
hair into a side braid really really
really tight because this is going to
form the low bun take your elastic tie
it off and roll it into a bun this is
really hard for me because my hair is
super thick but just pin it's a time so
it doesn't fall out then put loads of
hairspray so you have no whiskies and
that is the end of this updo for the
outfit I am wearing this super pretty a
fit-and-flare dress from choies it's
very simple classy and I absolutely love
it it'll be linked down below
then my shoes are these pointed nude
heels from Target also very classy and
match the look and my necklace is a
pearl necklace from Francesca's along
with my earrings and that's it for this
1960s Mad Men inspired looks so I really
hope you guys liked this give it a
thumbs up if you enjoy this and I'll see
you guys in my next video adios
EXO so Michelle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
