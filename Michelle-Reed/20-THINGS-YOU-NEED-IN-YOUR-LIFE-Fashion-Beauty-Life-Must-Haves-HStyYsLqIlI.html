and exciting new series that I'm doing
on my channel and it's going to be 20
things that you need in your life from
beauty things to fashion things to just
random favorites but instead of making
this a really long drawn-out favourites
video I'm gonna make these really quick
and snippy it just little looks into my
life and what I'm enjoying so I really
really hope you guys enjoy this I mean
they're gonna do these seasonally or
monthly I haven't really decided but
yeah let's just go ahead and get into so
first I have a perfume a branded out
would be the brand clean I'm gonna talk
a little bit more about this one but the
other ones will be kind of fast just
because I'm really passionate about this
brand very very simple nostalgic brand
and they're also eco-friendly so they
don't test on animals they don't use a
ton of dyes and chemicals I'm really
passionate about that and so I really
really like that about this company I'm
not a big perfume person but these are
very very simple and just nice perfumes
basically with these you pick multiple
perfumes and you layer them which is so
cool because you have a very unique
scent
I usually start with this base set this
is clean air it's a very kind of woody
floral scent and it's very feminine and
light so you can wear this alone but
then I like to switch over and use a
second one this is clean blossom this
one smells more like Magnolia flowers
and orange blossom so it's definitely a
little sweeter but the two of these
together smells so so light and feminine
these are both available on clean
perfume calm and they're around $69 so
have them linked down below if you want
to check them out they've been my
favorite perfume so far I have a lot of
other fragrance pairings that you can do
they have clean sunkissed skin which is
a delicate creamy set with HUC freshness
and they also have clean warm cotton
breeze which is a bright fresh scent and
both of these are $59 and great summer
scents and if you want to try out
different pairings they also have really
great holiday scents and roller balls
which are perfect for summer travel they
have two sizes one for ten dollars and
one for 20 dollars or around $18 you can
try different roller balls and see what
you like so I'll have all the
information about cleans down below if
you want to check them out but they've
definitely been one of my favorite
companies for this month I've been
loving the shade + light eye palette
from Kat Von D as the most beautiful
matte shades it has like your warm tones
or cool tones your neutrals pretty much
everything that you would
I shadow Palace the Laura Mercier tinted
moisturizer has also been a favorite I
love this my skin has cleared up and so
I don't really need to wear foundation
and so this gives just the perfect
amount of coverage and it also has SPF
which is great the Revlon Ultra HD matte
lip colors these are phenomenal I love
wearing these I have this one on today
this is in the shade seduction it's a
really pretty just nude pink color and I
think it really complements my skin tone
this right here has been such a
lifesaver this is the safe to face
self-tanner basically gone through this
whole bottle it gives a really nice just
as glowy fresh like healthy tan it's not
too orange E it's not too Brown it's
just such a good self-tanner and I
basically use this every week just to
give off kind of a nice little of myself
recently I also got a new purse that I
have been loving this is a huge great
purse from it made while I adore this
purse it is beautiful so nice just to
throw all of my notebooks and stuff in
there and it all fits nicely and it's
just been a really convenience now this
is a fashion favorite it's a jumpsuit
it's this beautiful paisley pattern and
it's kind of a dark blue and then it
just fades out into these legs I posted
a picture on Instagram wearing this but
it is from Windsor and I love it
jumpsuits are so comfortable it's so
easy for spring and this one it's just
the best next I have a jean jacket this
is from j.crew I really like the color
of this because it's not super light but
it's not super dark it's just a nice
denim jacket but this is from j.crew and
I throw it on basically everything if
I'm feeling kind of chilly and it works
great these are my mate ball sandals
that I recently purchased but I love
them because they're so simple and you
just slide them on and they look really
really nice and put together and they
match with everything so I think every
much another pair of sandals like also
been loving my platforms these are just
black platform sandals from Nine West
I've shown these in quite a few videos
but I love them because if you're
wearing something simple you can just
throw these on and it makes
look so much more edgy and just kind of
different and different it's great I've
also been loving this blow out hairstyle
I think it's so pretty and effortless I
just posted a video on how to get this I
do this all night oh and it's so easy
and it's just great for spring and the
roses in my back area actually just
bloomed so I've always been having some
fresh flowers in my room and it has been
such a big favor because fresh flowers
just instantly boost my mood and they're
beautiful music favorites I have been
loving honey it's a Joe and then yeah I
love his music his music is so so chill
and great for driving and I've been
loving it my favorite songs I ever
probably Kostal love they'll be like
doubles I've also been loving the
Lumineers lately I love this song go
philia I know it's really popular but it
just it's such a good song and this
coffee has also been another big
favorite I have been on this coffee kick
lately
I love getting iced coffee from
Starbucks with vanilla and then a little
bit of almond milk it's so good food
favorites um bananas I've been obsessed
with really ripe bananas putting them in
smoothies or my oatmeal
I've just been enos I've recently become
one of my favorite fruits they're
amazing another food favorite has been
oatmeal I showed this in one of my last
videos but there's a certain brand of
oatmeal that I just love it tastes so
good and it's the one breakfast item
that I can eat and I'm full but I don't
feel bloated
so great so working out has been big -
every single night I work out for an
hour and it makes me feel so good I
usually have a couple of rest days but
I've been really dedicated to my
workouts and I can definitely see
improvement just like overall my toning
and stuff I don't know I just show you
guys guns but gym just working on my
fitness yeah workout try it kids it's
really nice
I'm really nice to people I know this
should always be a thing but it's
especially been a thing this month just
worrying about other people before
myself something that I've been
lately my most favorite has been a color
I just love olive green lately like
wearing it putting it as my eye shadow

of crisps so those are 20 things that
