guys for easy summer heatless hairstyles
a good thing about this video these
hairstyles work the best with dirty hair
and nothing says summer quite like not
washing your hair in four days right cuz
I know I haven't if you're new to my
channel hello I'm so happy that you
stumbled across this video my name is
Michelle and you should definitely
subscribe because subscribing is good
and you know I'd love to get to know ya
and I think that's really everything I
have to say before we get into the video
so let's just go ahead and see the
hairstyles I don't know what this was so
most of these hairstyles involve
fishtail braids so I'm first going to
show you guys how to fishtail braid all
you do is split the section of hair in
half and then you take a small section
from the other piece move it across the
other one and pull and do the same on
the other side so you just keep doing
this all the way down and make sure you
tighten it as you go and that's
basically it once you get the hang of it
it's super easy so first we are starting
off with this double side fishtail braid
so I'm starting off by taking about a 3
inch section and making sure to leave
out some of my bangs and then I'm just
fishtail braiding this down to about a
little past my ear level and then I'm
just securing it with an elastic and
loosening it so it looks thicker and has
more texture then I just added that
piece into another section and then
split the bottom section in half and
just continue to braiding like a normal
fishtail side braid until I was all the
way down and again I just secured this
and loosened it up like I did the first
braid and that's it this hairstyle I
think is pretty easy and it looks very
like texturized and really boho I really
like it
this next hairstyle is just two braids
put back into a nice slow messy bun so
it's great when it's hot outside and you
want your hair off your neck so I'm
starting off by finding my middle part
and then taking two sections from the
front about three inches each and
basically to do this braid all you do is
start off like a normal braid and then
take the outside piece grab a section
and then braid that in and take the
other outside piece and braid that in
and gradually do that until you don't
have any more hair to braid in and just
go into a normal braid until it reaches
the center of the back of your head so
I'm just doing this on both sides of my
head and loosening it up like I did
earlier and making sure to secure it as
well
after you have both of the braids you
can just go ahead and put them back into
the bun and I kind of just like to twist
it around and just do whatever looks
messy and nice and I also secured it
with some bobby pins and that's it this
is probably the easiest hairstyle and it
is super duper cute
our third hairstyle our classic pigtails
but they are fishtail and they're super
cool this is probably my favorite
hairstyle so I'm starting off by finding
a middle part and then just taking two
sections from the front and fishtail
braiding them all the way down to about
a little past my ear like I did on the
first hairstyle then I'm just loosening
up the braids and I totally feel like a
ram when I have these two pieces braided
and then I'm just putting them into the
rest of the hair and braiding down
fishtail braiding down and you can try
to hide the clear elastics the best that
you can and then you just loosen it up
it looked a lot better in the intro but
these ones weren't as good but yeah they
should look cute if you do it
now that's here so I've actually already
done in a video but it's always
requested and it's just a fishtail updo
all I do is part my hair into a middle
part and then take two sections and just
fishtail braid them down like normal and
then loosen it up I like always you know
the drill that after you've done it to
both sides you just take one piece I
like to twist it and then put it across
to prevent weird things in the front and
then I pin it and then I pull the other
piece across and tuck it under the under
one so that you can hide the fear la six
and then I always have these weird Tufts
in the front so I like to pin them down
and loosen up my hair so it's not too
structured and that's it for the updo so
those are all the hairstyles that I have
to show you guys I had so much fun
coming up with these and just getting
really creative with my hair it's
actually really fun to do and I simply
suggest trying it out definitely like
this video if you're thinking about
trying any of these hair cells because
I'd love to know if you are
yeah but already you should definitely
watch my last video it was a lazy summer
day routine and it was super fun to film
and I really liked how it came out it
was definitely one of my best videos I
think
yeah I really hope you guys like this
video and I'll see you guys in my next
one which will will be Thursday bye my
friends I love you all so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
