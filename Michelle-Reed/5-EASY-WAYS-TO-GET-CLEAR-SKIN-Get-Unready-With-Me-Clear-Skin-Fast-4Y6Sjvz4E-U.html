of makeup videos get ready with me these
tutorials etc people trying to perfect
their faces when in reality make it
begins with skincare not the get ready
with me but the get unready with me hi I
stay I'm coming to you guys with zero
makeup on because I'm doing a video guys
I could get on ready with me kind of 5
tips to get clear skin kind of video
today I just wanted you to sit down and
talk about skincare with you guys
because it's something that's really
important to me I also want to shout out
to origins for sponsoring this video you
guys are the greatest
and I love their products and I'm really
excited to be working with them in this
video and of course if you are not
already subscribed to my channel you
should definitely subscribe the button
I'll be right here somewhere so now
let's go ahead and get into the 5 tips
so my first tip would be to develop a
skincare routine just to do nightly this
is the one that I do every single night
before I go to bed I always start out
with my Neutrogena and makeup remover
wipes these are the only ones that don't
irritate my eyes and so I really like
using these they really get off all the
makeup pretty well I then use my buy all
greens cleanser which is also a mask
it's basically a two on one product but
I use this to detoxify my skin I apply
this product by dispensing it onto my
hand and then I kind of put a layer onto
my face and I let it sit for a couple
minutes just to let the foam develop and
then after about two minutes I will wet
my fingers and I will go ahead and kind
of turn it into a foam and just scrub my
face as if it was a cleanser and then I
will rinse the product off I absolutely
love this cleanser slash mask because it
includes both spinach and green tea
which are great for your face it's super
natural and it's also available in
Sephora and online at origins com so I
will have the link down below and I
definitely would recommend checking out
the product it's definitely a staple in
my skincare routine I then like to go in
with a toner this is my favorite one
from Clinique it's just the basic one
and I apply this to my face it kind of
gets rid of all the excess makeup that
didn't get off with the cleanser
and it's just a really refreshing feel
so then after that I use my first day
beauty ultra Repair lotion I love this
it's great if you have dry skin because
I personally do have dry skin and then
some nights I will use my charcoal mask
from origins about once a week tip
number two would be to exercise exercise
is so important to keeping clear skin
because a it provides a lot of oxygen to
yourselves which is great for your face
and B it reduces stress and stress is
one of the number one things that causes
acne and it's something that not a lot
of people like to pinpoint we're really
eager to try out all these new products
and stuff but we don't want to exercise
when that is so so valuable in reducing
stress and personally with all my
homework and college stuff coming up in
AP tests it's so important for me to
give myself that hour of time to
exercise because it reflects in my face
my face isn't breaking out like crazy
because I'm giving it the time it needs
to kind of relax that relax but do some
exercise to never ever go to bed with
makeup on I know so many people who
never wash their face and they always
sleep with makeup on like how do you do
that it is so bad for your skin just
make sure before you go to bed you
develop that routine that skincare
routine and you do it every night so
your skin is fresh and clean trust me in
the long run it will thank you for being
nice to it thank you for treating it
with the love and the character tip
number four you have probably heard all
the time I know but it is to drink
enough water water is so important to
hydrating your skin and giving it that
glow that it has you can try a
moisturizer after moisturizer when in
reality if you just drink enough water
your skin will get that moisture I know
a lot of you both dry skin and that's
different but I'm just saying in general
drinking enough water will give your
skin that glowy look all in all drinking
water is good for you in so many
different ways tip number five would be
to eat clean and eat right you probably
heard it so many times you are what you
eat and this because it's true if you're
eating a ton of sweets and sugars it's
good to show in your face your face is
going to break out because it's not
liking the foods that you're putting in
there how to eat lots of sweet potatoes
to vegetables nuts and legumes a ton of
plant products plant products are really
really good for your skin and they're
gonna reflect in a way that your skin
looks so I hope you guys enjoyed
listening to these five easy tips to
clear skin you should also go watch my
last video was a QA all about my life
choices in the future and college so if
you're interested in my life definitely
check out that video and I'll see you
guys in my next one
