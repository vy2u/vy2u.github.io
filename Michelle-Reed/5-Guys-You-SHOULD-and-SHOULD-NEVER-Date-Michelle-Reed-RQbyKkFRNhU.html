if you're new to my channel you should
definitely subscribe
I'm also this daily vlogging over on my
blog channel which is the sail out of
your shelf so you guys should definitely
check out that channel as well today's
video I'm gonna be talking about five
types of guys that you should date if I
have two guys that you should not date
so I seem to really like my dating
videos in the past whenever I've talked
about things like intimacy and sex
relationships and conflict and all that
kind of stuff I thought today that I
would just sit down and filled one of
these videos obviously when it comes to
dating everyone has different lists of
what they like and what they don't like
this is personally just my experience
from dating of what I would encourage
you guys to look for also what kind tell
you guys what to do this is just my
opinion I hope you guys enjoyed this let
me know if you do and let's just go
ahead and get right into the video so to
start this video I doesn't be talking
about the five things that I would see
is red flag things that you should look
for and things that maybe in a guy that
says that you shouldn't seek them number
one would be someone who is controlling
if someone is always looking for ways to
control your time looking for ways to
control how you live your life who you
hang out with what you eat I would say
that these are all warning signs so I
think it's Dylan cares for you they're
naturally going to give you advice on
things but if someone is always trying
to change the way that you do life I
think that that would be a warning sign
number two would be someone who lacks
ambition if someone is always sitting
around not actually caring about life
not cleaning stuff to actually prepare a
future I'll being diligent in a way that
keeps Pence's time I would say that
these are things that indicate that this
person doesn't have an addition for me
the most attractive thing I think in
someone is someone who has goals
ambitions and works hard to achieve
those things whenever someone talks a
lot of talk but doesn't actually put in
the effort to make those goals happen
for me that's a big warning sign and
that's someone that you shouldn't see
number three you guys may not
necessarily agree with me but for me
personally someone who doesn't want to
commit is a big warning sign I just got
a person that actually likes to see the
future with someone whenever I'm dating
them I don't really date short term I
don't just date around to have fun which
I know some people are into which is
five but that's just personally not my
way of doing things so someone ever
wants to commit so much who is always
canceling plans
someone who is constantly putting you at
the end of their list I think that that
is personally something that is a
wrestler I think I kyumin's we really
like to be valued and we really like to
be prioritize and so when someone does
it prioritize you it hurts especially
whenever you see like a future with this
person you're into them you want to be
prioritized you want to be loved you
want them to actually put you at the top
of their list in terms of doing things
with you number four would be someone
who can never have a serious
conversation with you but for me if I
can't have conversations that go more
than surface level this is a red flag
for me and a lot of people like really
really funny guys and guys who never
really take things seriously I'm the
humor is important if you share the same
humor so what it can be so much fun
hanging out with them but if someone
never can have like an actual
conversation with you and never actually
talked about like things that you're
going through problems that you may have
ears that you have guy that you're
dating should take you seriously take
your problems seriously and if he
doesn't I always say this is a red block
number five is the most important to me
and that would be someone who is
coaching especially when it comes to
boundaries now I know everyone doesn't
have physical boundaries whenever
they're dating but for me personally and
a lot of people there are just certain
things that you don't want to do with
someone the guy is always pressuring you
to do things that you don't want to and
saying it's okay it doesn't matter it's
not a big deal I think that this is a
really big red flag I think before you
start dating you should be on the same
page with boundaries but even if the art
if a guy is always pressuring you to do
things that you don't want to do this is
a huge red flag
you should immediately get out the
relationship your boundaries are
important they're not stupid if you
don't feel comfortable doing something
you should never feel like you have to
do this demux my things are things that
I would say are good signs whenever
you're dating someone and things that
you should look for number one would be
if he treats his mom well know this
might be a really old-fashioned but I
was drawn believer that if a guy treats
his mom well that he's probably going to
treat you well if a guy is really
disrespectful to his mom and always rude
to her and never respectful to her and
never helpful I think that's not cooking
it really meant morning spine and I feel
like guys generally treat you how they
treat their moms and I might be stupid a
lot of you guys may disagree with that
but for me Presley I also on it's
usually pretty accurate number two it
would be impede support splash
encourages you if you are dating a guy
who is
supporters of what you're doing if they
aren't like good healthy things a guy
that encourages you that I want to see
you succeed I think these are beautiful
beautiful things and you should
definitely keep dating this guy I still
want to really just drive off of support
and encouragement and I'm kind of bad at
showing that towards other people's ever
me being in a relationship where a guy
actually like trust what I'm doing and
believes in me and supports me it's a
big confidence booster is really
important I don't think that should be
the only thing that you thrive also and
you should have some sort of
self-confidence the third thing would be
if he is there when it's not necessarily
convenient there have been so many times
when I've just had like issues or
problems or conflicts or things that pop
up and the person I'm dating is right
there ready to talk to me ready to be
there for me I can't express how much
that means and how important that is
it's really easy to be there for people
when it's convenient for you whatever
you're off doing anything so one is
there even when they have a test the
next day or even when they're really
trust out they're really tired they just
want to go to bed but they stay up and
talk with you they pick out your
problems and they try to figure out your
heart I think that's such a beautiful
thing but I was doing that for you keep
them number four would be if he can be
stupid with you and goof off with you I
know this may seem stupid but honestly
whenever a guy looks at me whenever I'm
doing so stupid I'm just having fun
being myself and he joins in said look
at me like you're weird not in such a
beautiful thing that's like one of the
most attractive things you should be
able to be yourself and be quirky and do
like weird little things or the person
you're dating without feeling like
you're going to be judge or without
feeling like they're going to think that
you're like unattractive or something
number five would be if he genuinely
makes you happy I know a lot of times we
can be blinded and think that something
is real happiness what it's not but if
you genuinely go to bed at night feeling
like yet this person is making me happy
this person is respecting me I think
they can keep them around and just leave
Lyra but relationships are worked and
not every moment is going to be this
beautiful rainbows and butterflies tides
fantasy in your head but I do think for
the most part the person you're dating
should be making you happy and should
be bringing out the joy within you so at
the end of this video if you guys liked

one of your best likes down below and
also let me know one thing that you
really like whenever you're dating
