video because well this title might seem
kind of like gimmicky and may seem a
little bit clique baby I'm actually
being like a hundred percent honest in
this video these are five things that
you need to do a college so you're not
like first semester of college mean it's
so easy in college to give yourself to
so many different things whether it be
like friendships or jobs or internships
or clubs and it's so easy to stop caring
for yourself and your mental health your
physical health and so these are things
that I would recommend even if you're
not on college to be doing especially if
you're going back this semester
especially if you're gonna be going into
college next year these are things to
keep in mind first semester I really
just wore down my mental health I didn't
really expect college to be that crazy
and it was and I kind of forgot how to
take care of myself and I neglected
these things and I just ended the
semester really really tired as always
my name is Michelle I make college
videos and lifestyle videos fashion
videos I also blog on a second channel
shell out of her shell if you want to
join my family
I've been connecting a lot with you guys
recently and I really think that's great
so you should subscribe number one is to
give yourself an hour every single
morning to yourself now I don't mean
that you have to be like doing this hour
apart from getting ready but I know so
many people call it you wake up really
late and that is just a recipe for
disaster that is going to make you
stress in the morning and you don't want
to start off your day stress and I feel
like if you do that it's just going to
make you have really bad days and so in
the morning I really like to spend a lot
of time just like quietly listening to
music doing stuff that I like to do I
recently got a French press coffee
machine so I have like five minutes in
the morning to make my French press
coffee and that's like my favorite time
of the day and then I'll just like drink
my coffee and do my makeup pretty slowly
do my hair put on an outfit and just
really take that time to like spend
investing and my personal parents
personal health eating a good breakfast
that kind of thing because I feel like
once you start your day off right the
rest is just
much better don't roll out of bed even
if you have an 8:00 a.m. even if you
have a 9:00 a.m.
even if you have a club in the morning
wake up an hour earlier once you do it
for a week I find it's a lot easier to
do but like sleeping in is just not
worth it if you sacrifice that time eat
at least one healthy meal a day it's
hard eating healthy in college and it's
just not realistic to expect that each
meal you have every single day is going
to be extremely healthy because I could
tell you it probably well but if you do
at least one meal a day that's a step in
a good direction and when you're filling
your body with healthy things you are
going to be a healthier person too
so for me it's really easy for me to do
the healthy breakfast I think I just
said that weird you know what I mean
healthy breakfast is really easy I love
to make smoothie bowls and I also love
to make overnight oats or oatmeal these
are two of my favorite meals and if I
start my day with these I just find that
I just feel really healthy and I'm more
likely to eat healthy later in the day
gonna be doing a college healthy eating
kind of week of my life of what I eat so
make sure to stay tuned for that great
something that isn't for class it's so
easy in college to just read books that
you're assigned because chances are
you're gonna have a lot a lot of reading
in college right now I'm reading the
reason for got by Tim Keller and it's
such a good book but reading something
that is not assigned to you it's just
really good for your health it lets you
pick out what you want to be interested
in even if you're not interested in your
classes puts you in a good mindset it
keeps you in a good place it keeps you
having a good relationship with reading
reading is it something that you're
forced to do with something you choose
to do stop skimping on skin care my
first semester of college I did not like
wash my face while I would just wash it
with my cleanser but I would never use
skin care products do skin care at night
it literally takes five minutes it's not
a big deal even if you're lazy even if
you don't want to take off your makeup
do it because College it's so much
easier to break out I'm inserting these
pictures so many times in my videos but
my skin looked like this after my first
semester because literally all the
stress I was experiencing was releasing
on my face and you just want to make
sure that you're like keeping your skin
well and I find that whenever my skin is
really healthy
just feel really healthy I'm more
confident I don't have to wear as much
makeup right often feel like I have to
wear as much makeup and I'm just overall
like a much better person when I'm
investing in my skin and then lastly
would be to FaceTime your family I am
really bad at this because I get so busy
in New York life is just ten times
faster than it is anywhere else and it's
so easy to forget to FaceTime people
that you love but every time I would
FaceTime my family we would actually use
that house party so we could all fit on
it I would feel so much better and
sometimes you just need people from home
to remind you like hey this is who you
are this is who we are we love you we're
supporting you if you're stressed it's
just really good to FaceTime family and
if you don't have family you're close to
a really close friend also helps someone
who's not like in your school or in your
everyday routine we're going to survive
you who you are I think that's also
really important to have make sure to
leave down below what is one thing that
you would recommend everyone doing next
semester in college I really want us to
just like help each other out on this
video because mental health and physical
health is so important in college you
just like cannot lose that so don't
forget to subscribe I will see you guys
next week in my next video I love you
all so very much my friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
