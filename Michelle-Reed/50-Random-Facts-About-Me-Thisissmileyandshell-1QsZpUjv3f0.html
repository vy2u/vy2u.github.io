doing a 50 random facts about you video
because I did this a long time ago but I
kind of just felt like doing another one
so I don't want this to be like a 30
minute long video so we're just going to
go ahead and get into it I have four
siblings two brothers and two sisters
I was born in Chicago Illinois I love
working hours on end on one thing until
it's finished because I feel really
really accomplished
I am extremely independent I am addicted
to the drink coke so yes I love soda
which i think is very rare to find among
a youtuber because I think every
youtuber hate soda
I will pet any dog that I see on the
street because I am the biggest dog
lover there is no breath I definitely
not be healthiest person in the world I
do eat my fair share of junk food even
though I really hate hot weather I still
live in Texas where it is definitely
pretty hot I don't really know why but I
have a terrible fear of getting in
trouble by someone else I actually enjoy
getting constructive criticism because
it means I can make myself better or my
projects better
I am also my biggest critic this may be
a shock but I am completely unorganized
in all aspects of my life I love pugs I
am naturally a very quiet person I am
also a very good listener though I can
only buy real flowers because I hate
fake flowers I just do not like how they
look they're not real they're just
trying to be something they're not and
they make me kind of Angry yeah I'm a
perfectionist in school with my grades
but not really in other aspects of my
life Jesus Christ is my Lord and my
Savior I absolutely love learning new
things nothing makes me happier than
meeting my viewers in public I just want
to cry every time I see someone who
watches my videos because it kind of
just makes you realize that this is all
real even though I'm quiet I actually
love public speaking' I created this
YouTube channel when I was nine and when
I was into American Girl dolls which now
nine year olds are into iPhone 6s but
you know times have changed I have never
been outside of the country yet I'm okay
with not traveling too much because I am
definitely a homebody I'm actually not
even fan of Pinterest I am terrible at
running it's something I wish I was
better at but I just can't run for the
life of me I choose
my front tooth in third grade when I was
trying to slam dunk yes that is a true
story
my ultimate biggest pet peeve is
whenever you're trying to talk to
someone but they just stay on their
phone it's so rude and I kind of hate
technology in this way my first ever
concert was the Cheetah Girls no shame
no shame
I am a morning person so I love getting
up before everyone else and just kind of
starting the day by myself and drinking
my coffee and I just I do not like
Nutella I absolutely love music from the
60s 70s and 80s and it's my favorite
Pandora station to listen to I have
absolutely no idea what I want to do
with my life I actually have a pretty
decent memory I am NOT a procrastinator
I hate leaving thanks for the last
minute because it stresses me out
so I will always do something
immediately when I get it because I just
hates that feeling of stress I am 5 foot
7 even though I film videos of myself I
would much rather be behind the camera
filming other people do things I could
eat a whole bag or carton of goldfish in
one sitting
I love goldfish I have had a long hair
all of my life because my mom knew that
whenever I was a kid I would want long
hair so she never really cut it that
much and that is why I'm here today with
long hair I am pretty terrible at
staying up late because I love me some
sleep I'm not really a very picky ear
but I absolutely hate seafood like just
the texture and the fact that I'm eating
Seattle's even though I eat regular
animals this is going for it my absolute
dream car would be a Fiat 500 because
they're so cute and tiny and I just want
one so bad I actually love getting ready
in the morning so doing my makeup in my
hair and thinking my outfit it's
actually really really enjoyable for me
I am extremely conscious about my grades
which could be a good and a bad thing I
am very very close with all my family
members there pretty much all my best
friends and it's something that I'm
really really thankful for being so
close with my family and all I really
really wish I could speak another
language fluently even though I'm not
the biggest traveler I would really like
to go to college outside of my state
just like I try something new breakfast
is my favorite meal I love eggs and
pancakes and hash browns
good stuff I love to read and I really
wish that I have more time to do it I am
actually terrible at drawing and my
handwriting looks like a boys I'm not
even kidding
it's kind of embarrassing that's the end
of this video I really hope you guys
