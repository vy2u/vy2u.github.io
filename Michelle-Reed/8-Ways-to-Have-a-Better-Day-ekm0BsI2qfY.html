in heaven
hi guys today I'm here to do such an
exciting video it is going to be ten
ways to have a better day wait a second
guys I really meant to say eight ways
because I know sometimes we just have
really bad days and we need to pick me
up some activities to do just to lift
our spirits because life can be hard I
do want to note that I don't think true
happiness can be achieved by doing
materialistic things like treating
yourself or going on a run you know
happiness has to be something that is
within yourself and it's more of a
mindset but these things are still
helpful when you just need something to
do to get your mind off things if you're
new to my channel don't subscribe button
will be right here and I'm alone I'd
really appreciate it I upload every
Thursday and I'd love to have you here
and let's just go ahead and get into the
video
what was this I I don't know let's get
into the video my first tip would be to
relax we definitely need to give
ourselves some time to recharge before
taking on big activities and big things
that we need to do so I love enjoying a
cup of tea after school to calm myself
before doing my homework lately I've
been digging this herbal tea it's
actually called tiny tea helps me with
bloating since I go home after lunch and
I'm always a little bit full and it
really helps me feel better it helps
with digestion energy and healthy weight
loss and although I'm not really looking
to lose weight I love the boosted energy
gives me without having to drink coffee
because I'm kind of a coffee addict it
may sound intense but it's actually
super gentle what uses traditional
Chinese medicine principles to really
help boost your system and I've never
really been a tea person but this one is
so good you need time to recharge after
school to be more productive so just sit
down with a cup of tea I'll have this
one linked down below it's been my
favorite and yeah I've been enjoying
watching vlogs recently too so I love me
sunblock Tober I'm watching Molly's
right here who all have like down below
if you want to check her out and yeah
that's pretty much it also got to take a
few of those really embarrassing
snapchat pictures so here's an example
of what I look like when I snapchat if
you wanted to know I believe it is super
important to start or end your day with
exercise I love ending my day with
exercise because it really cleanses my
mind and it gets rid of all the bad
thoughts that I have in my head and so I
definitely recommend doing this for the
past few weeks I worked out every day or
every night and it feels so good and I
can just tell that I'm overall just such
a happier person so definitely try
running stretching getting outdoors it's
awesome every now and then it is also
important to treat yourself I'm not
saying every day go out and buy a new
sweater that's not it treating yourself
comes in many different forms for many
different people it may be reading a
book or enjoying a cup of tea or buying
a new scarf if you're me maybe so yeah
just every now and then when you're
having a bad day do some retail therapy
it's not always beneficial but I think
it helps sometimes maybe try treating
others as well sometimes people are
having bad days and they really need
something to pick themselves up and
you'll get the satisfaction of knowing
that you made someone's day yes
soon Erika pay for the person behind me
drew
the Internet can be an awesome place for
positivity but at the same time there's
a lot of negativity on social media so
and you need to get something done or
you're just having a bad day try
unplugging from social media and I
promise your day will get a lot better
next I would recommend accomplishing
something so make a to-do list in the
morning and throughout the day check off
the things that you completed and this
will make you feel so much better like
you're being so productive and getting a
lot of things done even if it's just
like cleaning your room or workout just
simple things that make you feel like
you know today was a good day I actually
did something if you are having one of
those days try going for a drive with a
friend or a family member and I can
honestly say this just lifts your
spirits so much sometimes we're just
having a bad day and we need to drive
and look at the scenery and relax and
this is so important for you to get your
feelings out and you know spend some
time with someone that you love and
lastly if you're having a bad day or you
just need to complete a task try
listening to some upbeat music this
always pumps me up and gets me motivated
I will link a couple of my favourite
Spotify playlist down below if you're
interested too because music is great my
friends
I'll be daddy tree that was everything
that I have for this video I really hope
you guys enjoyed it definitely give this
video a like if you are ready to have
better days because life is fun and we
should enjoy it and I really hope this
helped you guys out if you're wanting
some fall inspiration definitely go
watch my last video I showed you guys my
go-to fall outfit and I had a ton of fun
at filming that and I absolutely loved
doing those videos so definitely check
that out and I'll see you guys my next
video bye friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
