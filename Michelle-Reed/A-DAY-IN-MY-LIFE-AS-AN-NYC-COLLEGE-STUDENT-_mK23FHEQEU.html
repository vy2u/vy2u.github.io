morning I decided today I would do a
vlog style video showing you guys what
my day looks like as a typical college
student in New York I've always wanted
to do one of these videos but I've never
actually finished them but right now it
is 7:45 I woke up at 7 and I got ready
and I'm gonna take you guys throughout
my whole entire day now today I just
have a class at 9 a.m. and then it's
over at like 10:30 and then I'm doing
some studying with my boyfriend for a
presentation we have and then doing more
homework and then I think we're gonna
catch a movie tonight but I just thought
I would take you guys along like all the
little parts along the way of what it's
like going to school here I get so many
questions from you guys asking what it's
like going to school in New York and
what it's like like being a college
student in general so I thought that
this would be a good way to show you
guys exactly what my day looks like I am
not pretending to do anything in this
video my apartment is like kind of messy
in the background and it's really early
in the morning but I just thought it
would be fun let me know down below
where you go to school let's go and grab
breakfast
so for breakfast I'm just having some
Greek yogurt strawberries and granola
and chia seeds like what my usual
breakfast is usually do this or
overnight so we're gonna head off the
class I wanted to let you guys know this
backpack I'm using is from Madeline and
company I've just filmed what's my
background can you so you should
definitely check it out allow me to
introduce myself
so pivot classic Kings is so good it's
like you actually want to be there is
like you have to be there then I worked
on a presentation with my boyfriend and
now I'm headed back to the pyramid to do
more homework we also got pizza it was
really good to do it's a j.crew but
super rainy today right I want to head
back to the apartment early I would also
like to clarify that I do indeed have a
roommate here her name is hailey she
just does that class right now and doing
stuff because she works a lot and so
she's not here like all the time but
definitely when she comes back I will
show her if she feels up to it every
time I come back to the apartment I
always want to snack every time I put
fruit in here at free foods and it's so
after feeding you're good I realized if
you're watching this video and you don't
really watch my videos normally probably
don't know like where I go to school
what I do I go to the Kings College it's
really really great I love it as a
school it's tiny but all the classes are
great it's just an education that is
very very different to Christian school
and it's very Christian base and it's
just everything they asked for in
college the classes that I have this
semester are microeconomics American
political thought and practice like part
one business communications new
Testament and financial accounting and
I'm also a business major and I really
like my class is all so far they're
really really great I also live in a
studio apartment and it's really cute
and small but it does the job and I
really care about school and I really
wanted to do well in school and this is
like a Tuesday night so I'm not doing
anything crazy which I thought was a
good time to vlog so you can get like an
actual sense of what my day looks like
in you your need of good study music I
love finding these like hour-long
playlists that just say like study beads
I'll have this one linked down below if
you want to check it out but I'm about
to do some homework while listening to
this it's really relaxing and it makes
me focus
I feel like a lot of this food that's
okay because that's a big part of my
life I'm gonna start making dinner I'm
gonna make a sweet potato with some
salad because it's easy doesn't take
that long and it's good so my sweet
potatoes just came out I realize this
looks like no food this is all I'm
eating for dinner cuz I kinda just had
that snack and then I think I'm gonna
get so they got the movie tonight so I'm
gonna eat light so it's a little bit
later right now it's like 6:30 ish and
I'm about to go head to the movies with
my boyfriend he hasn't seen Dunkirk yet
and there is a theater and Cobble Hill
Brooklyn that is just really cute and
tiny and we like to like make the trek
to go there just cuz it's really cute so
we're gonna go there tonight itself
class tomorrow so it's not gonna be out
super early or anything but would it
show you guys what I'm wearing I'm so
just took off my makeup because for some
reason I have all of these or just these
two bug bites and I was like trying to
put foundation over there and just
wasn't working so like you know I'm just
gonna take off my makeup it's also
raining so this is kind of like my very
chill outfit so this is like the
overview of what I'm wearing tonight my
t-shirt is from the brand Hartmann
clothing and it's actually a really cool
t-shirt company they like contribute to
different charities depending on what
you buy and so I have this one it just
is cactus Club and then I have this like
oversized button-down shirt which I
thought I would never wear but I
actually heard all the time it's from
2020 AB it's really cute and then I just
have on leggings cuz I'm trying to be
comfortable and my boots are from Free
People and love these they just look
super distressed and I think they're
huge
so I just go back from the movie and it
was so much fun the going to bathe in
there's such a good time it's like 10:30
right now so I'm not to take the shower
and then go to sleep right now
I usually do go to bed like pretty early
or you should try to be a bed by like
11:00 that doesn't always happen
sometimes it's like 12 or 1 depending on
which this one really good David oh god
