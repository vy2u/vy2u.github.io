get asked what it's like living here
what is I going to college here and all
these questions and while I could sit
down and do a QA I want to show you guys
what it's like this is pretty raw this
is not me throwing out cool things that
I'm doing this is just a regular school
day what I do
vlog style in about three minutes hi
everybody I have not vlog did such a
long time guys I'm pretty sure it's been
like a month and I could sit here and I
could explain about how busy I've been I
just don't really think that's necessary
long story short um schools a lot and I
have been busy just doing stuff like
that
it's November 11 today it's a Friday
which is really exciting but I have
class this morning so I'm going to go to
class until 3:00 basically every school
we have houses which are groups of like
guys and girls and so my house is doing
something with another guy house so I
just decided that I was blog tonight
because I thought it would be fun I
guess a little update on live
it's November I go home and a week which
is so exciting my sister Lindsey's
getting married I don't think I've ever
been more excited to go home guys I'm
home for a week for Thanksgiving and
it's gonna be so much fun I'm looking
forward to it so so much I miss my
family like way more than you guys know
and so I'm really excited to go home and
see Ben just because it has been like
such a long time bouncing YouTube in
school is a lot guys and I think I've
been struggling to get it down but
everything comes in time so I'm not
worried but I just wanted to do a little
intro to this video that's my life spin
due to toe
anyway so I got back from class a little
bit of go try to go get a dress for my
sister's rehearsal dinner for winning
and give shoes but it didn't all work
then everywhere and I can't seem to find
anything but it's like four o'clock
right now and I need to go grocery
shopping so I'd a Trader Joe's these are
the parts of New York that are not so
glamorous having to walk to the grocery
store and do all your stuff fun I
literally don't have groceries right now
and I don't have any food and my school
is on a meal plan so it's like you have
to cook for yourself that's what I'm
doing it's nice actually looking forward
to going to class because your classes
