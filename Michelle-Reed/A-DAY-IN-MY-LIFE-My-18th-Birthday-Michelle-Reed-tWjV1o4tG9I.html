hi everybody today I'm going to be doing
a day my life video for my 18th birthday
it's July 1st and so I turned 18 today
and usually I would do these kind of
logs on my blog channel which is the
shell out of her shell but every time I
do a day of my life videos here on my
main channel you guys really seem to
like them like my graduation one and my
prom one they always do really well and
you guys really give me good feedback
and so I figured I would go ahead and
put this vlog on my main channel but
right now it's 9:30 and so I'm going to
go out for breakfast with my mom my
sister Jaime and gunner and it's a
Friday so everyone else is working right
now and so which is totally okay but
they're just the ones that are going to
come with me and I think we're just
going to hang out and stuff so for what
I'm wearing today I'm just wearing this
black jumpsuit which is from Windsor I
believe I just really like it it's
really really plain for my necklace this
one is from Nordstrom and then I have my
Daniel Wellington watch on number shoes
I'm just wearing my lucky brand shoes
which I think I featured in a haul video
but I love these my mom also got me some
peonies which are so so pretty and they
go really really well with my quote that
says there are always flowers for those
who want to see them happy birthday

say
