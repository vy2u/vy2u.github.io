business student in New York City aka
myself I also want to take care of for
sponsoring this video I will be talking
about them later in this video you guys
really like these day-in-the-life videos
and someone recommended that I do like a
business major once a lot of you guys
asked what major I am I'm just a general
business degree so I'm nothing like
specific but I thought it would be cool
to show you guys kind of my classwork
what kind of stuff I do flash like
running my own business with doing
YouTube how that works so I thought this
would be a fun video to do make sure
subscribe if you're new I do it's kind
of these videos all the time I also go
to the Kings College in New York City if
you're wondering so for today I have my
corporate finance class and I also have
my marketing class which my marketing
class is definitely my favorite class I
really respect my professor she just has
so much wisdom and she's like a business
leader and I think she's great my
corporate finance class is very new to
me and it's very difficult and so I'm
not very good at it it's like stocks and
bonds and that kind of stuff and I
actually have a quiz this morning which
I'm really nervous about so we'll see
how that goes but I have class at 9 a.m.
right now so it's about 8:00 I'm about
to leave and then I also have class at
3:00 so I'm going to need some work in
between then so have you been around for
a while you probably know I said this
like 50 times we have a business casual
dress code so I'm going to show you guys
what I'm wearing to class today my top
is from Topshop it's just this Thai
little top I'm wearing this skirt which
is princess Polly and then just some
tights which have like some little lines
in them with my Naturalizer booties and
that is it for my outfit
so I just got back from my nanny em and
my quiz guys I'm gonna be honest I don't
really think I did very well corporate
finance just does not come naturally to
me I'm not like a Docs and bonds kind of
person and I'm also new to excel so it's
a lot of new like functions and stuff
definitely weren't that great I also
like wasn't very rested and so it was
just not very good but it's okay I love
my marketing class though that class is
so interesting to me and I just I really
get it which is just nice to like get
something in class I have an interview
for an opportunity that I could be doing
with like a YouTube thing and so I have
that at 11:00 a phone call which I'm
going to pick up but before then I'm
gonna try to make some French press
coffee because I'm feeling a little bit
yeah so basically I would be like coming
and oak wondering like logistics so I
actually have started like seven years
ago so now I'm gonna finish some
homework and this is for my marketing
class basically what we have to do is
you read an entire case and then you do
a case study about it so you say like
the strengths and weaknesses and what
you would suggest the company to do to
do better this one is specifically
talking about like which customer
segment they should focus on and it's
also talking about their pricing
strategy and then how to market their
products and so basically this one is
for a company called HubSpot which you
guys probably know they're like real
companies and it's really interesting we
did one on Snapple that was super
interesting but it's really cool to do
this I love these I think they're so fun
so basically I ever in about four and a
half pages done I just need to do my
conclusion and I will be done so I'm
gonna go ahead and finish this up for my
class at 3:00 cuz it's like 11:15 right
now
turning in my right off isn't good so
now that I finished all of my school
work it's about 11:40 and now I'm going
to do work stuff until I have to go to
class so by work stuff I mean that I'm
gonna do this blog that I need to edit
because if you don't know I actually
have a vlog channel and while this video
is more blog style I do vlogs like three
times a week over on my second channel
Michelle to Rachelle so I'm gonna go
ahead and get that up I'm also going
into a really cool event next week I
have to write like a creative brief of
how I'm going to like market it because
I'm going there for like a PR reason and
the vlog is up if you want to go check
it out it's time for lunch
and what I like to do for lunch is make
a nice little bowl with some rice with
some lettuce a veggie burger and hummus
and some blue cheese and it tastes
really good so I'm gonna have to head to
class right now but I wanted to talk
about something that I usually do at
about this time right before I'm about
to head out I've recently started taking
the Carib personalized vitamin packs
basically they send you personalized
packs of five different vitamins that
you can choose using a quiz they come in
this really handy dandy box which I like
to keep right above my fridge just so I
know to take them every day but if you
take out the packs they basically say
your name and then they also have a
really cute quote I just think they're
really really cool if you're anything
like me you probably don't know jack
squat about vitamins and basically they
have this quiz where you can go online
and you can take this quiz it takes like
five minutes it's really easy and an
expert will actually help you select
find an ins that can promote your own
personal health because we're all
different we all have different things
that we want to achieve they actually
donate prenatal vitamins to women in
need based off of the purchases and so I
really think that's especially a good
cause especially cause my sister is
pregnant so it's really close to my
heart
recently I started taking vitamins
because as you guys know I'm actually a
vegetarian and so I recently started
getting like really small bruises on my
arms so I talked around and apparently
that's common whenever you don't have
enough b12 someone recommended
one of my videos oh I actually went
online and I took the care of test and
it actually recommended me b12 and so I
started taking that also in New York I
barely see the Sun and so I started
taking vitamin D because even in the
wintertime it's really important that
you get enough vitamin D I am also
really busy in college and my diet isn't
like the best it just helps me get
nutrients that I'm not getting from my
food because I am in college so I just
think it's all around a really cool
company if you want to get 25 percent
off your first month used the code
Michelle I also have care of links at
the top of the description box so I just
got back from a really sweet date my
boyfriend Ethan and I didn't really
celebrate on Valentine's Day we didn't
really get to do anything to get Club we
actually went out tonight and it was so
so fun I love him so much we always
usually do stuff on Friday nights and
it's always such a sweet way to end the
night and just like always makes me
really happy by marketing class today it
was also super super good it was really
interesting it was definitely a really
good lecture I think I'm about to hit
the hay for the night so I really hope
you guys enjoyed watching this vlog and
let me know if you like these day in my
life videos let me know if it was
helpful let me know what your major is
down below because I definitely love to

school because I think that it's a
