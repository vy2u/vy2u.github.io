at about 9:00 and my sister Lindsey's
currently sleeping in my room since she
has a new room
since she's home from college and then I
just brushed my teeth and went to get
some coffee because you cannot have a
morning without coffee
I spend a little bit of time in the
living room watching my dad play with
Roxy because they are the best of
friends let me tell you it is 10 o'clock
and we have just started the
Thanksgiving festivities this is Lindsey
she's picking up her air mattress she's
sleeping in my room but today I decided
that I was going to kind of blog my day
show you guys what I do on the holidays
cuz I thought that might be something
that you guys want to see you not admit
guys yeah so I just did my hair and
makeup my hair is just kind of my
typical curls they look like this
and then my makeup looks like this it
actually got a lot darker than I would
like but Jamie brought me Starbucks so
she rocks and it's delicious I also
wanted to show you guys my new Christmas
tree I got it from Hobby Lobby and it
makes me so happy
and then Thanksgiving we always wear
flannels so mine is from H&amp;amp;M decided to
see Crocs to walk because she was a
little hyper this always seems to happen
we found a kitty we wanted Roxy to wear
a flannel in our pictures so we put it
on her but do not worry we don't
normally dress up Roxy we just did it
for pictures and it was kind of cute and
she actually liked it I then just
watched my mom make the meal because
this means I get to sample a few things
which is always a good thing and this is
what our meal usually consists of we got
some stuffing green beans mashed
potatoes corn everything you can
possibly think of so it is approximately
6:00 o'clock and we are going to target
because they open at 6:00 for Black
Friday deals and we have nothing else to
do so we decided to do we just arrived
the target
it is random welcome very so I just got
back from going to targets and bath and
Bodyworks because they both opened at
about 6:00 tonight but I wanted to just
kind of end this vlog here because I
think I'm just gonna watch a movie and
then go to sleep because I'm so tired
hence these huge bags under my eyes
but I really hope you guys enjoyed this
vlog and kind of got to see what I get
to do on holidays because I love them
and I hope you guys enjoyed your
Thanksgiving and I'll see you guys in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
