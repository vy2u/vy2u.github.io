prom day and I'm so excited
today I'm going to be taking guys along
with me as I get ready have fun do some
shenanigans I like it stuff I don't know
how much footage
I'll have of the actual prom part
because it's not my prom it's the year
older than me since gunner is the senior
and I'm a junior so I think it'd be kind
of awkward
vlogging at the problems I don't really
know but we will see what happened don't
worry I've logged there today is a bit
unfortunate it is actually very cloudy
and a little bit rainy so that's no fun
but I mean I'm sure it'll still be a fun
day you got the sausage rolls and some
dolls and donut sticks she also got a
little car even some chocolate milk
which do these for anyone else I really
was called taking I made like elementary
school Roxy is creepy from the staircase
Jamie and I are currently on our way to
get our nails done because it's also
Jamie's prom it's actually Jamie I'm
actually a senior so
we don't really get our nails done that
often so this is kind of like a new
experience so we just went got our nails
done and first time getting acrylics
they feel a little weird they do feel
strange yeah I got new ones yeah
currently going into GSW right now oh
there's a lot of people here
you don't camera crews so I'm finally
going to be afraid you know I'm not
really sure I'm going to do I think I
might just do what I did in the banquet
video
so I just did my makeup and sprayed my
setting spray and I kind of did a crappy
job of filming it because I was like
really trying to focus on it I apologize
but I think I'm going to go grab
something to eat no it's a little hungry
the lighting was pretty bad over there
so this is what it actually looks like
it's pretty much the same exact thing as
my banquet one I actually am like 99%
sure it is the same paint we're gonna go
grab something to eat
I then just went ahead to work on
Jamie's makeup for her for prom my
sister Lindsey actually did my hair and
she basically just curled it and did a
poof in the prawn and the prawns in the
front it was super simple so Thank You
Lindsey I really liked how my hair
turned out Jamie and I are finished
getting ready
Lexi are you ready for prom are you
ready for prom hello Gunnar very nice
you look very nice we ready
oh my kinda always though I'm missing
something here yeah the video katralla
