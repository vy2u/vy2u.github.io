child to keep my head up to keep up a
smile a girl was to be strong elegant
and confident for it should never be
hard to accept a compliment but I have
one question that I must ask how do I
complete this difficult task when I live
in a world so vicious and heartless it's
impossible to escape the inevitable
darkness always consumed with material
and greed Tsering egos that they must
feed gossip is spreading like it's the
gospel sara is ugly and incredibly awful
confidence has become a foreign concept
as I grow to become so highly
self-conscious we claim to be so
accepting so open but I have never felt
this alone and broken we're told to be
different think outside the box that's
how they come and soaring like hawks
feeding on the things they think are
strange committing you that you must
change personality and morals are
irrelevant looks and appearances become
prevalent your pores and imperfections
must be erased along with that extra
weight on your waist we conform to the
patterns of the society since it's
proved to make us high in almighty but
once we start to look the same we're
shunned and given all the blame this
malicious cycle is never-ending as the
staircase of judgment continues
ascending when will they embrace who we
are including all of our mistakes and
scars these flaws making me me that's
why I make this desperate plea to fix
this world that we call ours to rid it
of the liars and cowards no one's
perfect
especially me but I dread the day when I
have to see my daughter crying into my
chest because she was told she wasn't
well dressed so that's my lament as a
shattered teen sick of the evil and
continuous greed how am I supposed to
keep up my head when I'm holding on by
such a fine thread
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
