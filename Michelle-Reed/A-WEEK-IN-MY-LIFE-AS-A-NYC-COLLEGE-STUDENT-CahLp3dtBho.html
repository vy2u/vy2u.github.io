at style con hi guys today is Sunday
September 17 I'm starting this week of
my life vlog on Sunday right now it's
like 12 o'clock I woke up at 9 wet and
got some coffee speaking I'm going to
style con so I'm trying to get like all
of my work done before I go home so
right now I'm just working eating some
breakfast doing that and then later this
evening I have church you go to church
at five o'clock today it's not the most
exciting day but you have a whole week
of vlog so it's going to be a great week
right now I'm currently headed to church
and I finished all my homework I'm gonna
go meet up with my boyfriend and then
we're gonna go and I'm really really
excited because I've been doing work for
so long I'm so where you just like have
a break and worship
I just got back from church I want to
apologize for not actually blogging like
after me I'm a very introverted person I
get kind of like sensory overload living
in New York sometimes and sometimes I
just like become a different person and
I just get really frustrated and I feel
like sometimes you see people's lives on
the internet like vlogging stuff in New
York and it's great but it's just I love
it though like I love it so much but I
just cooked up some dinner Brussels
sprouts sweet potatoes in a salmon
burger cuz I recently started eating
fish which I know some of you guys might
not like but it's my diet I'm just gonna
eat this so I just showered and my
body's a lot tighter than my face right
now because itself yeah the skin has
been a lot better than in the past and
so I wanted to tell you guys I've been
using this Clinique Moisture Surge I
promise it's not sponsored this stuff
just rocks and it's been like doing the
job at college I just use this and I
wash my face it's been like keeping it
really clear on my last video I forgot
to show you guys Haley so this is
Haley's Q&amp;amp;A with Haley Haley where you
from I'm on Waco Texas what's your
favorite thing to do that's not school
much more true what is your favorite
fashion item can I show that oh yes
there can you a favorite food Holly's
favorite part about New York things to
do and nobody expects you to drive nuts
Haley
so today is Monday I'm headed out for
class
it is about 9:15 and I busted 10:30 so
I'm about to leave right now but I want
to show you guys what I'm wearing to
class a lot of you guys act what I wear
for like a business casual dress code my
earrings today are from made well so I
just have on this white top this is from
j.crew
it's from video is just like a faux
suede little skirt it is kind of short
it's like obviously not everyone can
wear this my dress code isn't like that
picky and my shoes are just these black
booties which I got from dias Fe and
you're off to
for some required by law that we that
call all publicly funded educational
institutions of any sort provide
educational programming on the history
of the American Constitution on this day
it's not by the questions or after class
you've got just a few things trying to
get some dinner she got these sick pink
and green wig these are our house colors
yeah I like the length of the hair
though like come yet I brought my hair
you know this is what we do when we
procrastinate I'm making this egg
scramble that I saw and Molly bass and
watching Brooke Michiyo newest a blog
while I do it because she's really cute
it is Tuesday September 19 it is 12
o'clock right now I just got back from
class I also had to take a test and show
you guys my outfit this morning so I'm
gonna go ahead and do that so I have on
these hoop earrings which I don't know
where the phones in my sister and then I
have on my ring you guys always ask
where this ring is from it's from made
well and then my dress is from boohoo
it's really wrinkled but I honestly kind
of like how it looks wrinkled I think
it's cute that my shoes are just these
blast sandals you guys also always ask
where these are from they're from Nine
West it's really cute I like walking and
like the shoe like the equal to came off
and it's like my favorite shoes so I'm
really sad right now I'm really one key
to a really cute coffee today it's
September 30 it's like 12 o'clock I got
back from class and I went got lunch
with my friend Zoey which is really fun
so don't want to record those things
because when you're building friendships
is just like pulling out a camera and
recording things which is really rude I
want to interrupt this video for a quick
second just to say a little bit of a
thing that has been on my heart lately
I'm the kind of person who finds a lot
of purpose and identity and just like
straight up happiness and working hard
whenever I'm like working hard for a
greater purpose better than myself we
are like created us humans to do we are
not created to be lazy we're not created
to put our efforts into vain things
there's a verse in Proverbs that says
those who worked in land will have
abundant food but those who chafe
anti-seize have no sense and I just
think that's so true in my head I'm like
I'm in college I should be you know
partying I should be hanging out with
the groups of people I should be like
being stupid being a kid but at the end
of the day that's just not how I feel so
I'm ahead I'm like why do I feel like
that's what I should be doing how you
spend your life is how you spend your
life and no one is to tell you like what
you should be enjoying I just wanted to
say that because I feel like a lot of
times I just feel like I'm weird as a
person for doing the things that I do
and if you're the same Buddhist meet
you're not weird we are all cool that's
the end of a little bit
Shh I was trying to be really cute and
fill this on the roof because I feel
like I'd filmed a lot in my room the
roof opens at 8 a.m. it's like 755 some
reason I thought it was 8 and so I went
and I opened it and literally guys the
siren is going off it's 7:50 in the
morning it's so loud I literally woke up
like everyone in the building this kind
of stuff literally happens to me like
every single day it is Friday I didn't
pull out yesterday because honestly
nothing was happening in
