today's Monday so I am commencing my
finals week in my life if you don't know
me I'm Michelle and I am a junior in
college next year I'll be a senior so
this is my second to last finals week
which I am so excited for so I actually
don't have finals until Wednesday and
Thursday I have three finals but they're
hard finals so I'm gonna be studying all
the way up to there and then I subtract
of all my stuff and I move out on
Saturday to go back home to Texas and
I'm gonna do a separate moving vlog so
this is just going to be the finals
portion and then I'll have the moving
part in that one if you want to check
that out but right now it's about 10
a.m. I'm about to go get breakfast with
my boyfriend and because I'm going to be
leaving him for three months soon and so
I want to spend time with him so we're
gonna get breakfast and then we're gonna
go to the school and we are going to
study our butts off and get aids on all
of our finals my grades are the best
they've ever been and so this final
season I'm trying to get on President's
List which is basically a 4.0 which is
really hard at my school usually like
eight people get on it it's not like
something that like everyone gets I know
a lot of schools you can get a 4.0
without like having to try that hard at
the school so that's my game plan I'm
excited I'm gonna go get some eggs and
some coffee and get all fueled up
so today's Tuesday and yesterday's vlog
was kind of a fail and that's just
because I went out to breakfast with my
boyfriend and then right after that we
went to the school and I just worked
until about like 6 o'clock and then I
went got dinner with my brother and his
wife I came back home I went and I
worked out and then I studied a little
bit went to sleep but today's Tuesday
right now it is 10:20 I don't have any
finals today but today is like a
jam-packed study they hacked my stacks
I'm about to go to the school pretty
much all day I'm studying for my
economic thought and practice class I'm
also studying for my finance midterm I
feel like I wear this shirt and like
every single video but it's just really
comfy wearing black jeans wearing boots
I find whenever I study wearing real
clothes I take it more seriously I don't
know it helps me so I got back I've been
at the school since about 10:30 to 6:00
I left to go get food I went and ate
with Aidan I feel like I've studied so
much but there's still so much left to
study and I have to pack up and I'm just
really stressed right now and I know
there's so many things I should be doing
but my body is so tired for the rest of
the night I'm gonna make some coffee and
then continue studying which is great I
have my exam tomorrow which I want to do
well on I think I'm gonna watch
Christy's vlog so if you like it is time
for a break
my pack something I've been doing for my
coffee lately of course the bread fell
out of the fridge take your coffee but
in a blender
take coconut oil put just a little bit
of coconut oil in the blender blend up
the coffee and you get this really nice
like frothy consistency or it into your
mug it gets super frothy like a
cappuccino but it's like super healthy
because you didn't add a ton of stuff in
it after a day of studying is a face
mask and this one looks really scary and
it's not sticking to my face but it does
appeal so today's Wednesday and it is
about 9:45 I'm about to leave to go
start some studying again today
basically today I have my historical
theology test at 1:30 and then that's
all I have so imma stay at school and
study for my other two which I think are
gonna be hard are gonna be 80 degrees
today so I decided to put on shorts
feelin so good let's go ahead and take
on this day I took my theology final
which went really well so I feel really
good about that one I look like a mess
right now I'm cooking up some pasta I
never really eat pasta in college but I
don't have any food I don't wanna buy
food and so this is the organic brown
rice and quinoa one so it's technically
gluten-free but I don't really care I
just kind of eat it because I feel like
it's healthier but I'm gonna make that
go to bed early because my exam tomorrow
is at 8:30 it's my corporate finance one
it's gonna be hard it's probably gonna
be really bad positive mindset I just
shot a crazy person right now but
literally this is just the epitome of
finals I wanted to share a little bit of
a quick tip for studying I get a lot of
questions asking about study advice and
I feel like I've gotten pretty good at
figuring out how to actually study and
effectively so this is for my economic
thought and practice final and this is a
very detail-oriented final so he
basically lists all these different
economists you have to like put what
their theories were what school of
economic thought they were what time
period for this one I created a Quizlet
which I usually create quizlets for
everything because I really learned by
Quizlet this is my Quizlet right here as
you can see it's like super
detail-oriented I'll go through it once
and I will just make sure I know
everything like generally and I'll start
the ones that like I'm worried about and
I'm not very good at
and then I go through and I write them
all out so I'll have the flashcard up
and I will write the response and as you
can see I have so many of these I've
gone through this like probably ten
times and written out all like hundred
terms because for me I'm a visual
learner I have to write things to
actually remember things I'm not really
an auditory person and I can't just look
at something to memorize it so this
helps me so much guys I would definitely
recommend that if you're also someone
who's visual try this tip it works so
well created this about a week ago and
I've been doing it for about a week and
that's how I actually remember things
I got a 99 on this last midterm so I
really wanted trying to get that again
so that was why I'm trying so hard so
guys I am officially done with my junior
year my two finals are done I got back a
little bit ago I've been starting to
pack right now my corporate finance mom
was pretty rough I don't really know how
I didn't get it really well in the
economics one so I'm feeling good I'm
officially done I have like a day and a
half to pack and so I'm gonna be doing a
separate packing vlog when I talk about
my moving situation so I want to talk
about that so look forward to that which
will be coming and then I'm going to get
ice cream with Aidan just to kind of
celebrate being done with finals and
it's really hot outside
this is what I'm wearing out I just got
my hair back and a little bandana my
bodysuit is from forever 21 the whole
back is basically open so I think it's
super cute and then my favorite pants
you guys know I love these these are
from made well you can check these out
on do't I have them on one of my list
but I love them so that is what I'm
wearing so I came up to the real quick
because it is Friday
it is officially my last day here until
around August came up to the roof it's
like 11 o'clock I'm about to get
breakfast with my roommate knowledge and
its really bright up here so I can
barely see and then I'm going to
continue packing for my packing vlog and
then I'm also going to go get dinner
with Aidan hang out with him cuz it's my
last time seeing him for a long time I
want to show you guys my outfit today I
want to do a little bit of an outfit day
my top is from princess Polly I think
it's really cute and like ties in the
back then my shorts are from made well I
love these I can never find denim shorts
that actually look good and like fit me
right super duper cute and then for
shoes I'm just wearing these black
sandals which are from Target
I've locked in a while spending the
night with my boyfriend because I hadn't
seen him and the rest of the day I was
packing I look like a mess cuz I've been
cleaning and going crazy organizing this
I'm gonna head to sleep and I will see
you guys tomorrow

making us some coffee right now living

wonderful and then I and I actually mean

one of those people that says something
and then follows through with it no I'm
serious

year for so many reasons and in a way
that I wasn't expecting and in a way
that has absolutely you guys don't
understand how good of a person
Michelle is or actually you probably do

just the right moment and was the
