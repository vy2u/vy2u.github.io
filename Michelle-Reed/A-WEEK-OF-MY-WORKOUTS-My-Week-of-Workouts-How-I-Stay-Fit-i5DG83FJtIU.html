do BD and fashion and lifestyle stuff in
today's video is going to be a week of
my workouts as you guys know if you're
watching my blogs over at Michelle out
of her shell I pretty much work out 5 to
6 days a week and so I wanted to
document all the workouts I did this
week I know a lot of people are into
like heavy lifting and mostly just do
cardio and then I mix in like some ABS
legs arm workouts within and all those
workouts are also gonna be linked down
below if you want to check them out
also some of these angles are kind of
awkward so trying to be discreet because
I didn't want to film people at the gym
so if they're kind of weird that's why
if you have a favorite workout plan that
you're following right now let me know
what it is down below also make sure to
subscribe if you're new now let's just
go ahead and get into the workout
you
so I hope this video helped you guys out
if you are looking at pursuing a healthy
lifestyle and working out obviously I'm
not an expert and I don't know
everything but if you are in college or
you're around my age I think that these
are some really great workouts to follow
again make sure to subscribe if you are
new I'm gonna have a ton of videos
coming up because it's the summertime
and I have so much time to film but I
love you guys and I'll see you guys in
my next video my friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
