life video because we are going to
Austin and I decided to team you guys
along with me for my travels
made it to the hotel
oh hey there welcome to my crib ain't
nothin but a mistake
so I made it to the hotel and I were
about to there sleeps so I'll see you
guys tomorrow which is day two
ok Friday we have made it to our tour
we found the goods yeah
so we just got back to the hotel from
the tour and it was a really good time
it was really pretty in I think we all
enjoyed it Lindsay's back there but I
think we're just gonna do some resting
before we go back out because it's been
a long day it's really hot so yeah two
hours later at night we decided to go
explore downtown Austin and it was
honestly so pretty and so chill i
absolutely loved it
the capital building was also nearby so
we decided to check it out and it was so
pretty at nighttime definitely go at
night if you're planning to go see it
it's really really pretty and it was
just a cool experience to finally get to
say you know you've been at the capital
of your state Saturday morning and we
just got some breakfast and so Lindsay
and I are even breakfast that's on
camera I've got a well-balanced meal
right here we made it to the outlet
malls because we can't go somewhere and
not shop right
and we have to stop by Bucky's of course
when you really like beaver nuggets hi
guys I actually just got home a couple
minutes ago and I wanted to just do a
quick outro for this video I also wanted
to apologize for the length I know it
wasn't very long
I definitely anticipated having more
footage than I did it felt like I had a
lot but I guess I just didn't really
film a lot of parts which is completely
okay because I really just wanted to get
the feel of UT and explore not always be
filming everything so also I really
really enjoy blogging and know the
length of this video may contradict to
that statement but if you would like me
to create vlog channel definitely give
this video a thumbs up because I really
think I can do that and maybe do like
weekly vlogs or something my thought
process is instead of doing two videos
on this channel I can do one video on
this channel create a vlog channel and
do a weekly vlog on that one because I
feel like that would just work out a lot
better for me because it's really hard
to make to like nice good quality videos
for this one and said I could just do
more like relaxed ones on my vlog
channel so I don't know let me know what
you guys think about that because I
think it'd be really fun also you should
go check out my last video it was a Q&amp;amp;A
so I just talked about some things that
I was up to I answered some of your
crisis questions and it was a lot of fun
so check out that one and don't forget
to give me feedback on this video and
I'll see you guys my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
