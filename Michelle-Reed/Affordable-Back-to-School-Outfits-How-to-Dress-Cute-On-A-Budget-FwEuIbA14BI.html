it euphy screws get out of my head they
want to put your ice a bit ginny aqua
badbrakes hi friends my name is Michelle
rain and face video is going to be an
affordable back-to-school outfits video
I know going back to school and get so
expensive between buying like school
supplies and clothes and all that so
today I wanted to show you guys that you
can grow is really really cute but also
buy really affordable pieces if you
don't know me my name is Michelle Rhee
you should subscribe it or not but I'm
also in college and so money can get
really tight in college between buying
groceries and clothes and I also live in
New York City so everything is I double
the price of what it would normally be I
always tell you guys about a really cool
website that I have recently found that
I think can help you guys a lot if
you're trying to save money for school
basically this website is called shop
tiger and basically what it does is it
notifies you whenever items that you
really like online shopping go on sale
or if they're low on stuff or if they're
drops go out of stock it's really cool
because you can actually just attach it
to your browser and every time you know
you're just online shopping late at
night you just hit the button and then
you'll notify you whenever these items
go on sale see don't miss anything there
have been so many times whenever I'm
shopping and I'm like oh I really like
that but it's also really expensive and
I don't want to buy it and I totally
forget about it and like totally forget
that hey items go on sale so I missed
out on it and then it's gone whenever I
go back again that's why I love shop
Tiger because you don't break the bank
but you also don't miss out on items
that you really like it's also is it
something that you just have to use on
your laptop because aren't they and not
on my laptop that much I'm usually on my
phone right here and so I love shop
tires because I can also have it on my
phone to notify me and then I can also
have it on my laptop so I have two
different places another cool thing is
you can actually start collections of
things that you really like so say
you're just want to start like a
back-to-school clothing section where
you have all the things that you want to
kind of keep in mind that like hey this
would be cool for back-to-school they
save it in a collection you actually
share it to other people or on social
media so say you're going shopping with
your mom or something you want to be
like Oh mom I really like these pieces
you can send it to her and then she'll
also know when these things go on sale
one reason I really love shop Tiger is
because everything is in one place if
you look at my laptop guys you will see
it's a disaster like literally it has
links everywhere they're going to looks
like a garbage can and like a
electronic form I love Strassburger
because everything is just on one
website it's on one little area you can
just click it and it's all there I
really like the Speedwell bodysuit that
was literally like 50 dollars I'm not
spending $50 on a bodysuit so I waited I
use chefs tagger to notify me whenever
this bodysuit actually went on sale and
it's literally $9.99 now and I actually
bought it it's like this really cute
green rig bodysuit that's super duper
cute but I literally say $40 because I
use shop Tigers so you can definitely
use this it's free chalk Tiger is
sponsoring this video if you like it's
honestly just so helpful and something
that I've used for a while that I really
think it helped you guys out if you're
doing back-to-school shopping
so how would link down below if you want
to download shop tiger and start using
it today it's such a cool service I
totally recommend using it so everything
aside I really hope you guys enjoy these
affordable outfits let me know down
below which one you like the best and
let's just go ahead and get into it
so for outfit number one I'm wearing
this body con style dress from Old Navy
I got this on clearance for literally
seven dollars guys I'm not kidding it's
awesome and if it's not appropriate for
your dress code you can always tie
something around your waist and then for
shoes I am wearing these little loafers
that have roses on them I think they're
so cute they're from TJ Maxx they were
$25 and they're to brand Kathryn by
Catherine Malandrino
so for outfit number two I am wearing
this really cute little tank which is
from TJ Maxx it's actually free people
but it was $12 and also my jeans are Jo
jeans which are typically super
expensive but I got them from Nordstrom
Rack and they were around like $40 which
is a really good price for a good pair
of jeans
now this cardigan is from Madewell so it
is more pricey but I will link one
that's similar down below you can find
so many cute gray cardigans for really
cheap and then my sandals are just from
Target they were probably like $15
now I love this third outfit because I
think the skirt is adorable it's from
Old Navy and it was $17 and it's
probably still there right now so you
should definitely check it out links
down below and then my white top is from
the store called Uniqlo I think it was
around like $15 and then these sandals
are the brand Steve Madden but I got
them from TJ Maxx
and so they were literally 25 dollars so
that such an inexpensive outfit but I
think it just looks really classy and
cute and just proves that you can dress
really classy but also stay on a budget
now I know I tell me kind of showed in
these clips but I promise it like
actually didn't just those raising my
arms this little top is from Old Navy it
was like 17 dollars I think it's so cute
and classy I just hide it and then I'm
wearing the same Jo gene from earlier
and then my little yellow sandals are
also from Old Navy I think they were
like $15 as well they just add a really
cute little pop of color I just think
they really complete the outfit with the
cropped jeans I absolutely love this one
so those are all the outfits that I have
to show you guys I hope you guys enjoyed
