this video I wanted to mention that this
is going to be an after-school routine
so I'm basically going to be showing you
guys what I do after school and I'm also
going to be showing you guys what I do
at the night time too because after
school doesn't really last that long if
you know what I mean so if you're new
you should definitely subscribe to my
channel B button is right here or it'll
be down below if you want to hit it I
was definitely appreciated also let me
know down below what your favorite thing
to do after school is because I would
love to know and with all that being
said we're going to go ahead and get
into the video so the first thing I do
is get my car and turn on some John
Mayer music I've been diggin it lately
and then some days I will go to
Starbucks and get a drink since I do get
out at 1:15
this is my happy face because I got
Starbucks and then I had to Instagram it
of course because pics or it didn't
happen guys so you should definitely
follow me on there at Michelle Reid and
then I will head on home she travels
with the breeze so then I like to go
straight home and work on YouTube for a
couple of hours which is great about
getting off early because I get to take
that time to plan film edit a bunch of
videos for you guys say the same thing
Oh side note that black lab is not mine
no I did not get a new dog it's actually
my sister's boyfriends but they were
having a little play date today so then
I will head into my room and I will do
some homework and this clip it makes it
look like I don't have a lot of homework
but guys I definitely have at least
three hours a night although I only have
four classes I still take AP courses and
so they are very difficult so I like to
study and do all my homework at this
time I then like to go into my bathroom
and wash my face I actually just posted
a video all about how I've been clearing
up my skin with a key chain so I'll have
that link down below and also it
includes my skincare routine so you'll
get to see all the products that I'm
using here how I use them and all good
stuff
but taking off my makeup at night is
definitely one of the highlights of my
night because it feels so good you
should definitely like this video if you
agree with me on that then I like to go
catch up on some YouTube videos lately
I've been watching Haley Divine's vlogs
from Fiji she's like the cutest person
ever and I adore her videos especially
how she shoots them so but you should
definitely check her out she is awesome
and she has been my current obsession
and now it is dinner time we actually
had steaks tonight which usually doesn't
happen on the weekday so this was kind
of a luxury this meal was fantastic we
had some bread some creamed corn and
some salad and so that's what I ate for
dinner with my family and it was a good
time dinner is definitely my second
favorite part of the night I actually
have drilled team practice in the
morning so I'd like to go ahead and pick
out all of my outfits after turning on
some Spotify so I will go through pick
out what I want to wear and I will also
lay out my practice clothes because this
saves me so much time in the morning
since I already have to get up at 5:45
anyways
I then just brush my teeth and I will
hop in the shower again I take showers
at night because I want to save time in
the morning and then I will go ahead and
blow-dry my hair then I'll head into my
room and I will read my Bible I'd like
to read something at night because it
calms me down I have so much trouble
sleeping so this is the one way that
kind of relaxes me winds me down for the
night so I definitely recommend reading
before you go to bed and then I set my
alarm and cry a little bit on the inside
and go to sleep so does everything that
I do after school I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video let me know if you
did down below if you want to watch my
last video was actually all about a
accutane experience and how I'm cleared
on my skin so you should totally check
that one out and I'll see you guys my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
