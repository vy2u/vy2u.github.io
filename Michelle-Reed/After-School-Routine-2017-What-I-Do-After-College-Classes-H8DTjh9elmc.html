today's video is going to be an after
school or after class routine I've done
college night routines in college
morning routines but I've never done
just like it's straight up after school
routine it so it stays for you I'm going
to show you guys when do after school
including like studying tag I skin care
all that good stuff I want to say thank
you to the app Louie for sponsoring this
video I first heard about this app a few
weeks ago and I just thought it was such
a cool concept and something that has
never been done basically Lilly is an
app that helps you with shopping it
helps you find items of clothing that
will flatter your body basically how it
works is you just download the app and
then you go on and you will suggest you
know what things that you like so if you
like long skirts if you like short
skirts you put in your measurement so
Lilly knows what exactly like your body
is like and what's gonna best on you and
then basically she recommends you a ton
of clothes that you can shop for on your
phone it's also really fun because she
actually like talks to you like you're
just chatting like friends which i think
is really cool it's kind of like if you
were to go out with your friend to go
shopping but you don't actually have a
friend there right there it's great
because she can recommend clothes that
are actually gonna look good on you for
me I always order stuff and then I get
it and it just never looks good on me
it's oh I like Lilly in that actually
recommends clothes that are gonna look
good on you and that are gonna fit your
body officials suggest you close every
single week and she will let you know
when the price drops on them so if
you're waiting for something to go on
sale she will actually notify you so you
don't miss out on or even if you're not
an online shopping person you can
actually take Lilly and with you in a
store and she'll recommend a pieces
while you're there so I recently used
the app to buy this really cute skirt
that I absolutely love it's just this
wine colored skirt that has a bow at the
top and that has a really cute ruffle
and thing about me is I love long skirts
I love stuff that cinches in at the
waist because I think like my waist is a
feature that I'd like to kind of
accentuate my client and so lilly
recommended me this skirt and it fits
perfectly and so this is our true one I
wore a class in this video so if this is
your first time using Lilly you can
actually get free shipping and you can
also use my code to get $5 off so I'll
have the coupon code right here if you
want to use that if you want to check
her out and get five dollars off just
for using that and also if you decide
that you
like something you can get a return
label sent right to you to make the
returning process a lot a lot easier
that's our thing that I have to say if
you're new make sure to subscribe let's
just go ahead and get right into the
after school routine so I start off my
afternoon by just heading into my
apartment and I was wearing this really
cute skirt that I showed you guys in the
intro of this video but I love it I got
it off of the Lily app which I will have
link down below it's so so cute
afterwards I liked ahead and go get some
tea usually I have already had coffee
and so I don't like to have coffee after
class as well so I'll just make myself a
nice little cup of tea and change into
my comfy clothes these are some really
cute little PJ bottoms that I know
aren't that attractive but they're
really comfortable so I like to throw
them on while I'm doing some homework
and then I just like to open up my
laptop and kind of chill for a bit I
usually like to catch up on some YouTube
videos and watch some Netflix or
something I love this window in front of
my desk because you can actually like
open it up and watch people which sounds
creepy but people watching is fun you
can hear all like the sounds of the
neighborhood and it's just a really
really good time I love it I then like
to turn on some Spotify music for when I
study I've been into Foster the People
lately as you can tell I was dreaming
here basically how I study a lot of you
guys asked me I like to start off with
tangible assignments so if I have like a
paper to write or some math homework
I'll put that first and then next on my
list I will just have reading and then
I'll have studying at the bottom so
right here I was just doing some
financial accounting online homework
which is pretty lengthy it takes a while
for sure and then I also had a micro
paper to write and so that is what I was
writing and then I also had some reading
for my biz comm class and so I just went
ahead and read that I find doing things
in this order really helps because
whenever I get tangible assignments done
I feel like more motivated to do the
rest of the works and they've already
kind of done something actually that you
could hold then I head into my bathroom
and I'm usually kind of sick of wearing
makeup by this time so I like to run a
face wipe over my face and I wash it I
also have been into using masks a lot as
you can tell my skin has been a little
bit crazy lately I have a few little
breakouts and so I like to pop on in
Origins face masks these are three of my
favorites but today I'm using the dr.
Andrew wail for origins
I'd like this because it really
moisturizes my face it's a great
moisturizer also being a mask so just
leave that on I will go on my phone
watch some more YouTube videos reply to
emails or whatever and just kind of
chill for about 15 minutes then I'll go
ahead and rinse this face mask off I was
watching Monica Church and I loved that
video that she just posted I'll have it
linked down below you should definitely
check it out and then I just washed off
all my face masks and I also put on a
little bit of moisturizer and I already
feel rejuvenated and I'm usually ready
for some fresh air so I usually head out
of my apartment and I will actually go
for a walk I love my neighborhood
literally I'm so lucky and blessed to
live here and every time stress just
stepping outside and kind of looking
around at the brownstones just really
makes me really happy to live here and
really thankful that God allowed me to
live here and I just really really love
it this is like one of my favorite
things I do this pretty much every night
whether it's just me or was a friend or
with my boyfriend it's definitely one of
my favorite pastimes also within my
apartment building we had a knight
warship on the roof and so here's a
little segment of a singing it was a
great way to end the night
so that is the end of the school routine
I really hope you guys enjoyed watching
this video if you did give it a thumbs
up if you'd like to see more routines
