super-duper quick intro to this video
this is going to be my afternoon slash
night routine kind of thing for 2015 so
really hope you guys enjoyed this I love
filming these routine videos for you
guys make sure to give this video a
thumbs up if routine videos are one of
your faves because I think they are one
of mine too
I hope you guys enjoy and let's just go
ahead and get into it so I typically get
home at about 4 o'clock and I usually
tend to make this face cuz I'm super
excited whenever I walk into my house
I'm always greeted by Roxy aka my puppy
and she's the sweetest thing in the
world and then I go and set my stuff
down in the living room and I grab a
snack lately I've been really digging
bananas for some reason because they're
healthy and they taste good not the best
combo with coffee but they're pretty
good I give myself about 30 minutes
after school to reply to YouTube
comments watch some videos because I
think you need that time to just kind of
chill at about 4:30 I'll check my phone
and decide that I should probably start
my homework
so here I was studying for a history
test I had and also writing a paper in
French which I know is probably not
correct so my French viewers don't judge
me and then I get that feeling of
satisfaction whenever you finish
everything and then at about 6 o'clock I
will go put all my stuff away and start
doing some YouTube stuff so I will edit
videos while roxy watches me and just
finish whatever I have to do this night
I also packed up my gift for the winner
of my giveaway which was Rachel Lauren
because I wanted to ship that out then I
went and changed into some comfy clothes
I get a lot of questions about where
this green shirt is from and it's
actually from a local store but you can
probably find something like it also my
glasses are real I wanted to address
that
at seven o'clock I'll go watch some
Netflix and start making my dinner
tonight I decided to make pancakes and
usually I eats dinner with my family
with like a nice meal but no one was
home tonight so I just whipped up some
pancakes and added some chocolate chips
and that was my dinner I'll usually
check up on my social media too so make
sure to go follow me on Twitter at
smiling shell and on Instagram at this
is smiley and Shelley then I head to my
bathroom to wash my face and take my
shower
I like to turn on a Pandora station and
lately I've really been liking the walk
the moon one it's pretty nice to take
off my makeup I use the Neutrogena wipes
they're the only ones that don't burn my
eyes and then I use the Clinique liquid
face soap to wash my face I've used this
for years and I love it and then I tone
it with the clarifying lotion which
basically just gets off any excess oil
or makeup that the face wash did not get
the acne medication I'm on really dries
out my face
so this clinic Moisture Surge lotion is
the best for moisturizing and then I
also like to apply some aqua for because
it is the best thing for chapped lips
just can't speak in those and then of
course you've got to brush those teeth
after I take my shower I have to take my
little turban down and my hair is crazy
tangley after so I know he's a regular
brush and I'm the worst beauty guru who
ever I'm sorry I then turn on some
evening music from Spotify and I like to
read before I go to bed so I'm reading
this counterculture book right now but I
like to read instead of going on my
phone because it really calms me down
and makes me sleep better
then I just blow dry my hair and head
off to bed
so I really hope you guys liked this
video let me know if you did by maybe
tweeting me or follow me on Instagram
and post in the comments to something
because I thought to hear your feedback
like always I'll see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
