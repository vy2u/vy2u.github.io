I'm really excited because you guys
asked a ton of questions so I'm just
gonna go ahead and get started
will you be making a makeup channel um
no I'm really sorry I won't be making
one house just like my mix of videos at
the moment that's kind of my personality
I don't like just making Beauty videos
or just making like music videos so I
just kind of mash them together do you
have anything matte cosmetics it's kind
of expensive and I don't want to spend
that much and I think it's kind of
overrated but I mean can you do a makeup
collection I won't be doing a makeup
collection video just because I don't
have that big of a makeup collection so
it'd be kind of a pointless video this
is where I keep all my makeup if you're
wondering this is like my little mini
makeup collection
are you gonna be doing a back to school
series everybody's uploading that
everybody does those kind of videos so I
don't really think I will be you some
type of back to school video but it's
not gonna be like everybody else's what
grade are you going into I'm going into
eighth grade are you gonna be doing a
room tour no I have one of my rooms
pretty much the same forever 21 or
Charlotte Russe definitely forever 21 I
think Charlotte Russe is kind of cheap
favorite scent at Bath Body Works
probably warm vanilla sugar it's kind of
my scent oven or favorite color okay I
really like like this color of my nail
is just like minty green favorite view
Radley pattern I don't really know which
one it is but I think but it's like
mocha flowers or something is like pink

collection I might I don't really know
can you do it what's in my purse video I
actually have one like already and
edited I'm just waiting till the right
time to upload it how do you convince
your parents to let you wear makeup my
parents weren't that like strict I think
you should definitely just start off
with something that very like I'm
wearing like eyeliner or something like
that just tell them and make you feel
more comfortable I don't really know I'm
not good at this kind of stuff
what are your favorite stores there like
American Eagle Delia's like Marshalls

I love Urban Outfitters it's just really
pricey what phone do you have
it's the phone I have it looks like this
the background is Evelyn's kitty and
yeah it's a Samsung reclaim from Sprint
do you have a boyfriend I don't I think
middle school relationships are just
kind of dumb do you like pickles I
really like bread-and-butter pickles
those are pretty good
if you had ten million dollars to spend
what would you spend it on definitely a
house a car oh you're on a trip
somewhere see I'm really boring I buy
like the stuff that I would want I
wouldn't be like make up make up make

think they're good they're kind of cheap
they're brushes and such favorite brand

purse freak what is your favorite song
