sits out so Mike I say that hi guys
today I'm going to be doing a fun little
tag video at it is going to be the anti
boyfriend tab saw this going around
YouTube and I'm single and ready to
mingle so I decided that this would be
very appropriate for me to do yeah
that's why I'm doing this I don't know i
just went on like forever telling you
guys one like this video if you were
single and you want to do this video
because i think it's fun and cute and
yes go ahead and get started what is the
most important quality you look for in a
guy so very old fashioned with this but
i think that guys should be like head of
the house and just have leadership and
you know wear the pants in the
relationship because i like dresses guys
should be the head of the house and have
leadership so leadership is very
important quality looks like i said i'm
very good fashion what quality is
eternal me personally being cocky is a
huge turn off because when someone's
just obsessed with himself and talking
about themselves like 24 7 and how
absolutely what cool they are just
annoying in them nobody likes that I
don't know anybody who likes cocky guys
actually a lot of people like you guys
on her into them I just know what
physical feature do you notice first so
for me personally I definitely noticed
teeth and smile first because I think
straight teeth and just the cute smile
overall though it's definitely something
that I goes first I don't notice I color
I don't know his eyes at all i just
think eyes are kind of all the same i
know they're all different colors but I
feel like eyes are just note that Google
I think styles and dimples and all that
stuff is really
so complete soil is something that it
was first was really on describe your
dream date for me personally I have
always always always always always I
think that's not always wanted to go
dancing with somebody not like dirty
dancing or like line dancing necessarily
but just kind of like slow dancing kind
of thing I don't know why but I just
always wanted go dancing dancing with
somebody just be so much fun like going
out to eat and then dancing I'm so we're
not on it in my hands but think going
dancing would be really fun who would
your celebrity boyfriend be sure Roy yes
he's all family on Joseph gordon-levitt
dave Franco and James Franco and I know
dave Franco Jane Franco's are great I
don't David James or brothers by the
kind of package deal so they come
together and yes I would have for
celebrity boyfriend such as how is your
relationship deal for you somebody that
has bad hygiene hygiene is very
important for me being very well kept
and grooves and clean it's something
that's nice if you don't have that then
gonna have to go good hygiene it's
something that's very important but what
is your relationship dealmaker overall
somebody who's a gentleman and you live
in a south so I do you think southern
charm is very important and I i like
that i have to say and I think that
being a gentleman in being sweet and
treating your lady with love is
something that's very important and all
sounding like a jokey but i'm serious i
do think being a gentleman is very
important you guys you a gift what would
it be I honestly have no idea i don't
know what gift i think it should be
surprises so a surprise gift that I
don't know is something that you would
like but you say you have a type I don't
really think I have a type I have a type
of way I like guys to dress i'm a beauty
guru what do you expect or how guys
dress I think that like button down
shirt khaki pants and like Oxford's
oxfords oh my gosh Oxford's on guys I
can't even explain it's really cute i
love oxfords but that's a kind of way I
like I to dress not really preppy think
that is a way that are like ice address
I think it's nice but I don't really
have a type i kind of like all realms of
types
the world that is the end of this video
and I hope you guys enjoyed this is it
take it too seriously but if you are
single and you want to do this
definitely do it because I tag them
every single one you guys out there who
is single what does it have boyfriend
and i'll see you guys bye next one ah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
