guys today I'm gonna be doing a kind of
current slash April favorites it's May
now but it's kind of in the middle of
May so I'm a little late but better late
than never I think that's what they say
also I want to say that I bought a
microphone for this camera and it is not
compatible this is camera so I'm really
sorry I will be fixing the audio I know
it's a little fuzzy here and there but I
will be buying the microphone soon
hopefully one that is compatible with
the camera so yeah with that said let's
go ahead and get into my face first I
will be talking about is the company
called phone case of the month and
basically how this works is you pay $10
a month and they'll send you a different
case every single month and yeah they're
really cute they're really creative it's
a very quirky company and it's only ten
dollars and the cases aren't that bad
for being ten dollars also the shipping
is free so it's basically just $10 a
month but nothing added to that so they
come in these super cute little bags
that just say phone case at the month
they're so cute and they're just white
so it looks like this and it's just a
little owl case and it's grain it has a
super cute little orange owl and if I'm
not mistaken I think this is like the
wise owl one I really like this case
because it's kind of matte and I really
like matte case so kind of fuzzy also
says bow case of the month right there
that one that they sent me looks like
this and it's a bike if it says rolling
and to be completely honest I probably
would never really use this one because
I think this looks like more like a
guy's case but I mean it's just kind of
a hitting to miss thing and if you don't
like a case you can always just give it
away it's only ten dollars really cute
and quirky and they do have very
creative cases I will link all the links
down below to phone case of the month
and yeah I really like this company I
think it's quite Beauty favorites the
first one that I have is the ten color
blush palette from Coastal Scents it has
such pretty colors in a they're all
different colors some are bright some
are kind of dull some could almost be
bronzers like this one so the guys are
super pigmented it's awesome I'm not
being like sponsored to say this do you
think it sounds like a big sponsor I
really like it I think they're nice
pretty spring colors and I also have
another eyeshadow base from Color tattoo
this isn't bad to the bronze very kind
of dark brown bronzy color obviously so
about explaining I like to put this on
the kind of like outer corner of my eye
almost a crease to act
as a face before I put on like a crease
color in with powder eyeshadow and I
really like how it looks and I've been
doing this a lot luminex favorite I have
is an elf cream eyeliner and I've never
used to be an eyeliner person I never
wore eyeliner until recently I've been
loving just doing a very thin line on
the top of a halfway mark at my eye all
the way out I've been oh you're really
thin line in this elf cream eyeliner is
literally amazing gel consistency and
it's really easy and it stays black all
day and it's just really easy to work
with and it's only $3.00 I love you my
Revlon lipstick in sky pink just kind of
a baby pink matte color and it's super
pretty and I feel like the drugstore
doesn't really have very many neutral
color options without having tons of
shimmer in it but I just love this
because it's just a nice creamy
consistency and it's matte because I
don't really like glossy glossy lips all
but also someone told me that I should
stop by a drugstore makeup but I just
like drugstore makeup we really search
you can find stuff that's just as good
as high-end super here I have a product
this is the macadamia natural oil
healing oil treatment and I want to say
that I adore this I found this in my
bathroom somewhere and I was like what
am I not using this just put it in the
autumn of my hair just through the tips
where I have some like split ends of
whatnot and I really really love it it
works great it makes my hair so soft
I really just noticed a huge difference
in my hair and how silky it is it also
smells like freaking amazing so I would
definitely recommend this if you're
looking for something just to make your
hair a couple of nail polishes to show
you all I'm not sure if I have shown
some before it's called big spender by
Essie and this is literally all I've
been wearing it's all my nails now but
it's shifting girls don't look at it
it's a nice purpley pink color and my
friend Rose got this for me love it it I
wear it all the time on my toes you're
been loving what is this first tire from
Essie it's a nice kind of a green color
Rosanna mates but it's not like a
straight up Queen is just and awesome
cross between the two and I know a lot
of youtubers have been showing this
lately but it is honestly just a really
really great nail polish if you're into
greens I have one kind of jewelry thing
and I actually found this in my mom's
jewelry box it's a red watch from Eddie
Bauer really small and skinny but it
just has
and of a silver face on it and on this
because it is a nice pop of color yet
it's not super bright or anything it's
still really classy and I don't know I
just forgot my last favorite is a
swimsuit from Victoria's Secret I shove
this in a hall a long time ago but I've
actually been wearing it and I really
love it it looks like this
it's just a bandeau style swimsuit type
thing and it has a little like bright
colors all over it in little gold spikes
and I love this I need to get tanned
okay it's kind of a push up one but I
really don't think it's that push up I
don't think it's to pat it or anything
it has a little bit of high but it's
nothing super push up like target cell
so really push up some just gonna say
I'm just like why would you wear that
but this one is honestly not that push
up if you're scared of it
it's fine it's really comfortable really
recommend going to Victoria if you want
like a nice swimsuit I know they're more
on the expensive side but if you want
one nice swimsuit I would definitely
recommend going to pick towards that at
the end of my favourites video and I
hope you guys enjoyed this so if you
have a favorite to make sure to leave it
as a video response and I'll make sure
to see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
