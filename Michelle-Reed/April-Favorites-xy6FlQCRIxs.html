coconut tree hello guys today I'm going
to be doing a kind of current / april
favorites it's may know but it's kind of
in the middle of may so I'm a little
late but better late than never I think
that's what they say also i want to say
that i bought a microphone for this
camera and it is not compatible this is
camera so i'm really sorry i will be
fixing the audio i know it's a little
fuzzy here and there but i will be
buying a microphone soon hopefully one
that is compatible with the camera so
yeah with that said let's go ahead and
get into my favorite verse 8 when we
talking about is a company called phone
case of the month and basically how this
works is you pay ten dollars a month and
they'll send you a different case every
single month and yeah they're really
cute they're really creative it's a very
quirky company and it's only ten dollars
and cases aren't that bad for being ten
dollars also the shipping is free so
it's basically just ten dollars a month
but nothing added to that so they have
any super cute little bags that just say
phone case at the month they're so cute
and they're just white so excited it's
just a little al case and its grain it
has a super cute little orange owl and
if i'm not mistaken i think this is like
the wise owl one I really like this case
cuz its kind of mad and I really like
Matt case so kind of fuzzy also says
phone case of the month right there done
that they sent me looks like this and
it's a bike and it says role in it to be
completely honest I probably would never
really use this one because I think this
looks like more like a guy's case but I
mean it's just kind of a hitting to miss
thing and if you don't like a case you
can always just give it away it's only
ten dollars really cute and quirky and
they do have very creative cases i will
link all the links down below to phone
case of the month and yeah i really like
this company i think it's quite your
beauty favorites the first one that i
have is the 10 color blush palette from
Coastal Scents it has such pretty colors
in a they're all different colors some
are bright somewhere kind of dull some
can almost be broads like this one so
the code or super pigmented it's awesome
I'm not being like sponsor to say this
to make it sounds like a big sponsored I
really like it I think they're nice
pretty spring colors and I also have
another eyeshadow base from Color tattoo
this isn't bad to the bronze very kind
of dark brown bronzy color obviously so
about explaining I like to put this on
the kind of like outer corner of my eye
almost increased take act
as a face before I put on like a crease
color in with powder eyeshadow and I
really like how it looks and I've been
doing this a lot Luminex favorite I have
is an elf cream eyeliner and I've never
used to be an eyeliner person I never
wore eyeliner until recently I've been
loving just doing a very thin line on
the top of a half way market why I all
the way out at me know you're really
thin line in this elf cream eyeliner is
literally amazing the gel consistency
and it's really easy and it stays black
all day and it's just really easy to
work with and it's only three dollar
loving my revlon lipstick in skyping
just kind of a baby pink matte color and
it's super pretty and I feel like the
drugstore doesn't really have very many
neutral color options without having
tons of shimmer in it but I just love
this because it's just a nice creamy
consistency and its net because I don't
really like glossy glossy lips all but
also someone told me that I should stop
by drugstore makeup but I just like
drugstore makeup Lee really search you
can find stuff that's just as good as
high over here I have a product this is
the macadamia natural oil healing oil
treatment and I want to say that I adore
this I found this in my bathroom
somewhere and I was like what am I not
using this just put it in the autumn of
my hair just through the tips where I
have some like split ends of what not
and I really really love it works great
it makes my hair so soft I really just
noticed a huge difference in my hair and
how silky it is it also smells like
freaking amazing so I would definitely
recommend this if you're looking for
something just to make your hair a
little episode a couple of nail polishes
to show you all I'm not sure if I have
shown some before it's called big
spender by SE and this is literally all
I've been wearing it's all inhales now
but it's just engrossed don't look at it
it's a nice purpley pink color and my
friend Rose got this for me love it did
I wear it all the time on my toes have
you been loving what is this first tire
from se it's a nice kind of green color
with sana mates but it's not like a
straight up queen is just and awesome
cross between the two and I know a lot
of tubers have been showing this lately
but it is honestly just a really really
great nail polish if you're into greens
I have one kind of jewelry thing and I
actually found this in my mom's jewelry
box it's a red watch from eddie bauer
really small and skinny but it just has
of a silver face on it and this because
it is a nice pop of color yet it's not
super bright or anything it's still
really classy and I don't know I just
probably my last favorite is a swimsuit
from victoria secret i shove this in a
hole a long time ago but I've actually
been wearing it and I really love it it
looks like this it's just a bandeau
style swimsuit type thing and it has
little like bright colors all over it in
little gold specks and I'd love this I
need to get tan though it's kind of a
push-up one but I really don't think
it's that push-up I don't think it's to
Pat it or anything it has a little bit
of high but it's nothing super push up
like target cell so really push up
sometime just going to say I'm just like
why would you wear that but this one is
honestly not that push-up if you're
scared of it it's fine it's really
comfortable really recommend going to
Victoria here if you want like a nice
swim suit I know there are more on the
expensive side but if you want one nice
swimsuit I would definitely recommend
going to Victorian sat at the end of my
favorites video and I hope you guys
enjoyed this so if you have a favorite
