favorites video because I have not done
one of these since like april or march i
can't even remember also i just want to
apologize for being kind of missing
lately and not uploading for a week
which is insane and I'm mentally
punching myself in the face because
that's not good but now I'm back and
hopefully my videos will be back in gear
and normally uploaded again without
further ado let's go ahead and get stars
I guess I'm just have to start off with
beauty favorites because I honestly
don't have that many to like to move
first thing is a foundation and this is
the Maybelline fit me foundation and
it's just a stick foundation which is
very odd it's kind of a creamy
consistency and I absolutely love this
because you can put it on areas that you
need more coverage i guess so i can just
put this under my eyes or on my nose
whenever I don't have to like cake on
base makeup everywhere on my face stays
on pretty long it's not Kiki
surprisingly because when you look at a
stick like this you probably think it's
going to be cakey and it's super matte
which I also love I absolutely love this
if you're looking for a great cheap
drugstore foundation i would definitely
recommend this i also have the carnies
skin renew roller bowl ignore the black
my eyeliner hooded but this is basically
a rollerball that has concealer in it
which is awesome and it feels so good on
your eyes because it's very cooling and
it's a pretty light concealer but i like
to put this under my eyes and it's the
only coverage i really neither wakes me
up in the morning time whenever i am
getting running after practice and i
want to die because i'm so tired it
works great it's pretty cheap too it's
from the drugstore so i definitely
recommend this if you're looking for a
good so for eyes i have a mascara this
is the Maybelline one by one usually
when i get mascara i change it up every
time i buy a new one because i like to
switch things up but recently i've just
been repurchased on this one because i
love it it really really separates your
eyelashes which I like because a lot of
Oscars are really clumpy and this one
just doesn't do that I def
we recommend getting this it's a great
cheap drugstore mascara you know what
and you should try it because it's
awesome and I'm what am i doing I'm just
don't understand I last like makeup
favorites would be the Cielo smudge
stick waterproof eyeliner and Dan sell
some dark brown color just been loving a
brown eyeliner over black because black
can be a little harsh and especially for
school I just don't like it that much
but this I absolutely love it's just
like I said brown color and it goes on
pretty smoothly it's a really really
great eyeliner it came with one of my
palette I've just really been enjoying
brown eyeliner over black recently so
then I have to nail polishes because I
love nail polish if you know me I'm the
first one is from Urban Outfitters this
is a love letter and it is a neon coral
roxy and love this on my toes it's super
bright and it just stands out a lot and
i'm probably not to stop using this
though since it is fall just wear darker
colors because that's the thing but i
really really like this color it's a
neon orange i also have been wearing
this one if this is definitely more of a
fall color it's inch in chile from s 0
it's college in chile and it's from SE
and it's just a kind of purply stone
color i guess i don't know can't wait to
wear this for the whole time because
it's one of the very few fall colors
that i enjoy because i like my bright
colors i don't really like the Maroons
and such but this is a very pretty color
and i definitely recommend it if it'll
give her a good full nail polish so my
last like beauty related item is a
perfume and this is the sofa on carmella
from benefit and I just absolutely love
this it's my favorite kind of fall
perfume it's very very sweet because I
love sweet scents they're my favorite
but I probably wear this more for the
night time than the daytime because it
is a little more powerful more potent I
absolutely loves it such a sweet
definitely recommend it it's from
benefit too by the way its own tongue
Carmela the next thing I have is a
candle and I love candles candles on my
logs and the only one I've been burning
is leaves and I can just say I am guilty
as charged I bought leaves on I love it
I do think it is overrated because it's
not the best candle ever but it's
basically just fall in a candle I read
the bottom description because that kind
of sucks no offense it's such a bad
description it's like caramel rusting
out of the fire like it does not really
smell like that but just smells like
fall and I absolutely love it now on to
more random favourites I'm the first
thing I have as a thing called stereo
pod I think I'm saying that right if you
know me I'm all about adding my teeth
clean and stuff I just like to have
clean teeth because I hate the feeling
of having stuff on there and if you
don't know if you just set your
toothbrush like on your bathroom germs
and stuff get on the top and I did not
know this and that's when I figured out
about this thing called stereo pod and
their little like clip things and what
you do is you clip it on your toothbrush
like this or I guess you to go with that
too and what it does is it keeps like
the germs and some out there is little
cleaner right here I guess and you just
put it on your toothbrush and it keeps
it fresh it's a pretty cool concept it
almost looks like YouTube brushes like
Buzz Lightyear something does it
generate i don't know i just said them
but this is Italy it just looks cool
when you just have this in your bathroom
it looks like Buzz Lightyear to me I
don't know why but this one's green but
they also have a lot of different colors
like I said like kids blue and green and
here's red and orange I like the red and
orange ones too but I haven't used them
yet I mean they're not like toxic your
anything you want to worry about getting
sick by this it's perfectly safe it's
not going to damage your teeth or
anything then basically you just replace
these every three months because it's
tough finding it's like where's all but
most likely so let's make sure your
we're placing it but you do get to in a
pack so you're safe for six months you
gotta pack so to get your own Syria pod
if you're interested in you want your
teeth to be clean and bacteria free of
all we get the down bar and you can also
get it a bit
jana you don't want to water it because
i know that's not convenient for
everybody but i just wanted to try that
because i thought it was a cool concept
and it was brought to my attention and i
decided to share with you guys next I'm
going to just go on my phone and see my
music favorites because I don't normally
share music favorites but something
about me is I love music my favorite app
is Pandora because it's radio and
basically you just pick an artist or
song you like it it play stuff it's
similar to that I have been obsessed
with Bon Iver lately like literally it's
my obsession in the body bear pandora
station is absolutely perfect I favorite
songs from Bon Iver would probably be
holocene assistant I'm saying that right
holocene and I lent hours as well but i
absolutely love bon iver and i'd
definitely recommend them the temper
trap i love them as well bright eyes
vampire weekend vampire kick if it's
always on my favorite time I play a lot
of their music in my videos passion
pit's just all those and i will link my
favorite songs for the month down below

same taste as me in music those are
