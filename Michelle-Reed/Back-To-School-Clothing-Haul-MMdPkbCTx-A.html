back to school clothing haul because I
am going back to school August 27 and
I'm not happy about it but I did buy a
few things just to add to my wardrobe
also I'm going to be a sophomore in high
school if you were wondering quick
disclaimer of this summer I was saving
up for a laptop because mine is
literally about to die on me and so I
didn't spend that much money on clothes
and stuff so this whole isn't that
ginormous I honestly didn't need a whole
bunch of clothes or anything for school
so with all that being said I'm just
going to go ahead and get started so
first store I went to was H&amp;amp;M well
t-shirts were in my most recent lookbook
the first one is just a button-down
shirt I reward you have quite a few
button downs in this video because
that's basically what I where they're so
easy i don't know i just love them but
this one's just kind of a pinstripe blue
one off with brown buttons and it looks
pretty simple when you're just looking
at it but BAM it has these awesome
corduroy elbow pads and I love elbow pad
also I thought this is really cute very
simple and easy to wear to school I also
got this sweater which I am in love with
I can't really wear it for a while
because it's too hot here but it is just
a cream huge oversized sweaters almost a
high-low kind of has a v-neck so I think
so be really good for scarves and it's
just huge it's just a staple basic cream
sweater and I'm going to wear this so
much just with boots and jeans and all
that good fall stuff and I'm really
really excited for this I also got a
pair of shoes I have no idea what to
call these I don't know if these are
Oxford's or like tennis shoes or I don't
really know but they're just these suede
shoes that have little tassel tides on
them and they're so cute and I
absolutely love them i already got them
dirty oops i also bought a few things
from forever 21 I got this jean jacket
to wear with a few dresses that I have
it's just a very simple jean jacket its
kind of distressed and the back it has
just a little bit distressing in it it's
very simple very easy it's kind of just
staple piece that I didn't already have
so I decided to pick up one I know I
really like this I also place an order
off of forever 21 and I bought a few
things the first one is this dress and I
really sad because it doesn't fit me um
it's supposed to be big on you already
but it's just way too big on me it's
this really pretty kind of chiffon dress
and I don't know how to hold it up and
show you guys cuz it kind of folds over
at the waist the sleeves are really
really pretty though they're about to
your elbow again it just does not look
good on me but it's a really cute dress
so I'm really sad because I really like
this but I can't wear it also i got
another button down no surprise this was
just a gene kind of denim button-down
it's very very soft and thin I like this
one because it doesn't have a collar and
I think it's more feminine when it
doesn't have the color on it and it's
just really cute i think i'm going to
wear this with a bubble necklace on the
first day of school because it's pretty
chill not too crazy and its really
comfortable and i can tell i'm going to
wear this a lot because these are my
go-to kind of sure that I place in order
off of urban outfitters and I thought
another button down I have a problem I
know this one is just a striped shirt
and it has little floral designs on it
little flowers and it's so pretty it's
so just classic and I absolutely love
this and I think I'm just going to wear
this with some dark wash jeans and some
cute sandals or boots in the full time I
figure it is a nice piece to have i also
bought a pair of shoes because um i
don't have that many shoes i'm not like
a shoe person i just don't find shoes
all that awesome so i just picked up
these ones and they're just black
sandals and they're pretty simple so
they'll go with a lot does anybody else
like the small Merman outfitters
shooters yeah my friend Rose also gave
me a few of her things I just decided to
include this in this video because
they're cute of the first one is this
rose skirt and it's kind of
pencil skirt and it has little rosettes
all over it is really pretty and i feel
like i'm gonna wear this with like a
white shirt tucked in sometimes she also
gave me this pair of shorts which I
can't wear to school because they're too
short they're just these tribal pattern
shorts and they have like orange blue
and cream and black designs all over
them and their little distressed and it
like this I had no idea where these are
from but they're cute so sorry i also
want to a thrift store which rarely
happens because i can never find good
stuff at thrift stores but a new one
open and i found this skirt and it's
just a red kind of i don't even know how
to describe the shirt it just looks like
this and then the back has little pleats
in it it is a medium so it is kind of
big but if i wear high waisted it's fine
but i'm going to wear this with some
leggings and boots in the fall time and
i'm really really excited because it's a
really cute piece also it's from zara
originally which i've always wanted to
go to zara but they don't have one where
i live so I was really excited when I
found this because I've always wanted to
buy something from song is about a
couple pair of jeans because all I
basically wear to school is Jean I don't
know I just find jeans really
comfortable on these are the American
Eagle skinny stretch jeans and I'm
usually a size 2 in these but I got them
in a four because I'm going to roll them
up and make them cropped and I like when
cropped jeans are a little looser it
looks like this and as you can see I've
already cropped oh and legs I was trying
them on pretty simple they're kind of a
light / dark wash ass about this pair
which is more of a dark wash and these
are my favorite because I love dark wash
jeans and the pockets are simple so they
don't draw too much attention and yeah
they're just really simple and I love
these jeans are so comfortable in I just
love the last thing I have to show you
is the pair of shoes now these are not
for school because I don't wear heels to
school but my brother is getting married
at the end of august in like labor day
weekend and so I needed some shoes to go
with a dress and these are what they
look like they're just wedges they have
kind of a cork wedge on them
then they have straps right here and it
kind of hooked around that I absolutely
love these I love wedges if I can wear
like wedges every single day I would
because and they're the brand Jessica
Simpson by the way and i think i bought
these from dillards if you're wondering
so that is an my haul video I hope you
guys enjoyed this and make sure to like
this if you enjoy halls and you want me
to keep doing them in the future video
