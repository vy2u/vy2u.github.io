back to school clothing haul because
this is a video that you are it's really
really wanted to see there are a couple
things that I want to address though I
woke up early to film this video because
I knew I'd be busy so if I have like
that gross morning look that is why
secondly I got all of these dead ends of
my hair cut off so it looks any shorter
that is why we're gonna go ahead and get
into this video so while back I went to
anthropology and I've been starting to
wear Blazers more so I got this kind of
sweater a blazer it's a very nice like
chunky knit material and it's very soft
and cozy and really cute this is pretty
expensive but I really really wanted
just a staple blazer to wear in the fall
time so here that this was worth the
money next time up to this high enters
store called Buffalo Exchange and it's
awesome the clothes there are amazing
first thing I got is this oversized
denim button-down shirt because I
absolutely love these kind of shirts
they're so comfy and they go with
everything I got this just plain orange
II colors top with a bow in the back to
wear under Blazers and such because I
think that tank tops are so good to have
for layering and lot to say about this
top it is just a very simple kind of
slouchy gray shirt and it's a little bit
longer in the back
so I definitely think softest cheese
like this are great for school you can
just add a scarf or a necklace and they
look super cute next I want to j.crew
and I bought this thinking that it was
going to be really cheap because it was
on an outlet but I ended up being very
expensive so yeah it's just a kind of
cream-colored sweater very plain it's a
little bit oversized and then it has
leather Brown elbow patches which I love
elbow patches six-hour pair of shoes and
have only shoes I bought so far for
school but they are just white Congress
would like the red and blue lines on
them I know everyone has these but I
honestly don't have any like tennis
shoes that I actually wear to schools so
I needed them for my homecoming parade
anyway so I got when I went to American
you know and I really like American
Eagle jeans so I went ahead and bought a
couple these are just the super skinny
jeans are not jeggings are actual jeans
and they're just like a very very dark
wash and the pockets look like that I
love dark wash jeans they're my
favorites I also got the exact same pair
of these jeans in a judging form and
then I got a broad area I'm not going to
show that but it came with these free
like little shorts for pajamas and these
are so cute they have little umbrellas
on them and then like the shorts have
little ruffles on them I think that
these are so cute and comfy and I wear
them like every night to sleep then
October 21 I got a pair of denim shorts
not to wear to school when I needed
these for my homecoming parade so I got
these ones and then just denim like
cutoff shorts and I like a light wash
and I ordered a bunch of stuff from the
site called toys and they sell like kind
of unique stuff it's an international
website I've talked about it before
first thing I got is a pair of like one
of these envelopes cord so it's like a
skirt in the front shorts in the back
everybody has reminded me that I really
just wanted to hop on the bandwagon so I
bought this and it's so comfy family no
idea what to wear this with like every
shirt I put with this it looks terrible
so if you guys have any help on how I
should style this please let me know I
also got this super chunky knit
houndstooth skirt which I think would be
great for the fall time with like some
black tights and little boots
I just I'm imagining it right now and
it's gonna be perfect and then not too
Blazers from choies the first one is
just this in a nice striped one and then
it has kind of a flared out front it's a
little bit oversized but I really like
it it also has pockets which is nice
and very very cute and sophisticated and
I think that these are very very
beautiful and this one is more like a
jacket but it's just a black blazer and
it has like zippers on the side so it's
pretty punk rock pretty to you it's also
mine this is why I don't film videos at
8 o'clock in the morning this is what it
looks like it's just very cute and I
think that this is gonna be great for it
be following with their time then I got
this sweater and I'm she's gonna note
that like holding the sweater makes me
cringe I hated this material it's like
this gray sweater with orange suede
elbow pads and I thought it was gonna be
kind of oversized and it's kind of small
not really my cup of tea the material
feels really cheap so I don't really
like this make sure if I got is kind of
wrinkly I need to iron it but it's just
this kind of wine colored very simple
top it's a v-neck it's loose comfy and I
think these tops are great for school
because a lot of times I don't really
want to put together an outfit I just
want to put on a shirt so I put this on
and then like add a chunky necklace it
looks like you spent so much time on
your outfit when in reality it took like
two minutes but that is everything when
I bought for back to school what's on a
whole lot but I already have a lot of
clothes so I don't really need a ton of
things to be completely honest also I
got a really really pretty new bedding
from Kohl's I absolutely love it it's
the Lauren Conrad line so I might insert
a picture here you guys pretty stinking
cute at the end of this video school is
approaching so fast I go back in four
days and the tears are actually flowing
from my face right now but right now I'm
filming a ton to distract myself from
school coming so quickly so make sure to
request any more videos you'd like to
see and I'll see you guys in the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
