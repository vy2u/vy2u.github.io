back to school cloning call because this
is the video that you guys really really
wanted to see there are a couple things
that I want to address though I woke up
early to film this video because I knew
I'd be busy so I have like that gross
morning look that is why secondly I got
all of the dead ends of my hair cut off
so it looks any shorter that is why
we're going to go ahead and get into
this video so I'll back i went to
anthropology and I've been starting to
wear Blazers more so i got this kind of
sweater blazer um it's a very nice like
chunky knit material and it's very soft
and cozy and really cute this is pretty
expensive but i really really wanted
just a staple blazer to where the fall
time so fear that this was worth the
money next time went to this high enters
store called buffalo exchange and it's
awesome the clothes there are amazing
first thing i got is this oversized
denim button-down shirt because i
absolutely love these kind of shirts
they're so comfy they go with everything
I got this just plain orange colored top
with a bow in the back to wear under
Blazers and such because I think that
tank tops are so good to have for
layering I'm not say about this top it
is just a very simple kind of slouchy
gray shirt and it's a little bit longer
in the back so I definitely think
softest tease like this are great for
school you can just add a scarf or
necklace and they look super cute next I
want to j.crew and i bought this
thinking that it was going to be really
cheap because it was at an outlet but i
ended up being very expensive so yeah
it's just a kind of cream colored
sweater very plain it's a little bit
oversized and then it has leather brown
elbow patches which I love elbow patches
next time on pair of shoes and
only shoes I bought so far for school
but they are just white compris with
like the red and blue lights on them I
know everyone has these but I honestly
don't have any like tennis shoes that I
actually wear to school so I needed them
for my homecoming parade anyway so I got
these when i went to american eagle and
i really like american eagle gene so i
went ahead and bought a couple these are
just the super skinny jeans are not
jeggings or actual genes and they're
just like a very very dark wash and the
pockets look like that I love dark wash
jeans they're my favorites I also got
the exact same pair of these genes in a
judging form and then I got a broad area
i'm not going to show that but it came
with these free like little shorts for
pajamas and these are so cute they have
little umbrellas on them and then like
the shorts have little ruffles on them
and i think that these are so cute and
comfy and i wear them like every night
to sleep then at forever 21 i got a pair
of denim shorts not to wear to school
when i needed these for my homecoming
parade so I got these ones and then just
denim like cutoff shorts and I like a
light wash and I ordered a bunch of
stuff from the site called toys and they
sell like kind of unique stuff it's an
international website I've talked about
it before first thing I got is a pair of
like one of these envelopes scored so
it's like a skirt in the front short for
the back everybody has in mind me that I
really just wanted to hop on the
bandwagon so I bought this and it's so
comfy they have no idea what to wear
this with like every shirt I put with
this it looks terrible so if you guys
have any help on how I should style this
please let me know I also got this super
chunky knit houndstooth skirt which I
think will be great for the fall time
with like some black tights and little
boots I just I'm imagining it right now
it's going to be perfect and then got
two lasers from Choi's the first one is
just this navy striped one and then it
has kind of a flared out front it's a
little bit oversized but i really like
it it also has pockets which is nice
and very very cute and sophisticated and
I think that these are very very
beautiful and this one is more like a
jacket but it's just a black blazer and
it has like zippers on the side so it's
pretty punk rock pretty salsa hind this
is why I don't film videos at eight
o'clock in the morning this is what it
looks like it's just very cute and I
think that this is gonna be great for it
be following winter time then I got this
sweater and i'm just going to note that
like holding the sweater makes me cringe
i hated this material it's like this
gray sweater with orange suede elbow
pads and i thought it was gonna be kind
of oversized and kind of small not
really my cup of tea the material feels
really cheap so i don't really like this
the next year i got is kind of wrinkly i
need to iron it but it's just this kind
of wine colored very simple top it's a
v-neck it's loose comfy and I think
these tops are great for school because
a lot of times I don't really want to
put together an outfit I just want to
put on a shirt so I put this on and then
like add a chunky necklace it looks like
you spent so much time on your outfit
when in reality it took like two minutes
but that is everything when I bought for
back-to-school what's on a whole lot but
I already have a lot of clothes so I
don't really need a ton of things to be
completely honest also I got a really
really pretty new bedding from kohls I
absolutely love it it's the lauren
conrad line so i might insert a picture
here because pretty stinking cute at the
end of this video's school is
approaching so fast i go back in four
days and the tears are actually flowing
for my face right now but right now I
filming a time to distract myself from
school coming so quickly so make sure to
request any more videos you'd like to
see and i'll see you guys in the next
video hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
