you're new to my channel I make beauty
fashion videos I'm a college student you
should stick around I told myself that I
was going to stop doing makeup tutorials
because a lot of you guys said oh I make
it sort of with the same I was like yeah
kind of true but on this picture that I
posted on Instagram it's at Michelle
Reed if you're wondering so many of you
guys are like yo Michelle what are you
wearing I say I want to see you make a
tutorial and so today's video I decided
that I would bring you guys this look I
also thought those are really great
back-to-school make it cereal now
granted this is definitely a look less
like a full face like I kind of went
hand it took me like 25 minutes is it
like a really quick morning what I can
totally do that if you guys are like to
see that let me know down below and also
give you a thumbs up if you'd like like
a quick and easy watch my homegirls out
there who are kind of like me who kind
of like like doing makeup and it wakes
them up in the morning I think this is
like a really pretty look it's full face
it's good but okay everything that I
have to say let's go ahead and get right
into the video
so I've already applied coconut oil to
my face I don't like to use like
moisturizer I've just been using that
lately I didn't like to go off my
primary this is a Laura Mercier oil-free
foundation primer this honestly makes my
face look so much more smoother and just
gives me a really nice clean slate so
I'm just starting off of applying this
to my skin and then after that I like to
use my setting spray I like to use it
before and after I just find it really
like locks everything in so this is the
Urban Decay chill makeup setting spray
and using this lightly just and let that
dry for a little bit before foundation
my skin tone is literally always
changing if I've been mixing to that I
love this is the Clinique super belt
silk makeup this is in the shade silk
canvas and then I like to mix it with
the warm RC a flawless human ultra long
wear foundation so I just like to mix
that on the back of my hand
so it looks a little bit like but I
promise it does like actually that's my
skin tone then I'm just going you with
concealer this is the instant age rewind
brightening one I think the brightening
one is really good for highlighting on
into eye and under collar I'm using my
mercy silk translucent powder and I am
going to be baking underneath my eyes
basically just means you put a lot of
powder it sets your concealer but
obviously if this is for school like I
usually wouldn't bake but it's just
because I want to today I'm also just
dusting this powder on the rest of my
face really really light leaks I don't
want to look super cakey so now that I
look really really funny I'm going in
with the Clinique chubby stick sculpting
contour and so basically just like a
cream bronzer stick and I'm going to
apply this to my little cheek bone I
know it looks scary but I honestly feel
like it looks more natural than using
just bronzer after that was blended in I
like to take si Clinique chubby 6 again
and I like to just put it on my Beauty
Blender and I apply this to the forehead
over brows I'm using the goof crews brow
pencil from benefit if you're someone
who is like not that great at lining
your brows totally get this a lot of you
guys asked how I fill in my brows and I
really just kind of like follow where
they naturally are and fill them
then I just go in with a spoolie and
kind of brush it up and blend out all
product and if you're really feeling
like you want to I like to use the gimme
brow for benefit too just like a tiny
bit to add a little bit of color like
obviously you can totally skip this for
eyeshadow I literally keep things so
simple
I use my Naked 3 palette and I take this
shade right here which is limit it's
like a really nice kind of light mom and
I'm also using a little bit of nooner
which is kind of a darker brown color
and I'm going to apply this to the outer
corner it / kind of like deep enough to
crease a little bit and then using my
neat master Pony palette which is I
thank you this palette ever I think so
cute but then I'm just going with a
cream color I'm applying this under my
brow into my place so now that my under
eyes are done baking I just kinda like
to brush it all off trying to not get it
on like the cream contour that I did
earlier looking at all but can I get
aggressive when I do this and then I
just like to set my bronzer I'm using
the Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer
and I'm just lightly bronzing up my face
I am just using this wet and wild one
the cover came off but I think it's
mellow rose I'm just lightly very very
lightly applying this - I'm not lying to
me talk eyeliner but I am using this
white mix 1 to line my waterline it
really opens up my eyes I find it does
make a big difference I like doing it it
looks really scary right now I promise
it'll look normal then I'm just curling
my eyelashes implying - they're real
much less I'm using my soap &amp;amp; Glory
lipstick in the shade - / nude matte and
I'm just applying it to my lips I never
talk about I'm also applying their lip
gloss in the shade rose and shine guys
this smells just like the lush lip scrub
it is so nice I love it so I've been
sending everything with my urban decay
chill makeup setting spray I hope you
guys like this will make a tutorial let
me know if you try it I'll also let me
