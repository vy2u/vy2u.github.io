today's video I'm gonna be doing a
back-to-school clothing haul video I'm
going to be a sophomore in college next
shoot I know I look like I'm 5 this is
hair sell what I promise I am 90 not
high school or anything I do have a
dress code at college which I know a lot
of you guys might be like what and so
today's video I'm gonna show you guys
all the things I got I also live in New
York City though so some of new things
are just for like hitting the town going
out having fun and something too crazy
this isn't like a huge clothing haul or
anything let me know down below what
your favorite place to shop at is
because I'm about to do a ton of more
shopping music still need a few things
to go before I go back to school so the
first thing I want to talk about in this
haul video is something that you
probably don't see normally and try on
clothing haul but that is deodorant I
don't love it you guys are probably
going back to school and for me I'm get
so nervous on the first day of school
and like stress sweat is a thing is I
just felt like putting pewter and C
would be kind of cool I have a loving
spring of the unit which is called datum
and basically CEO Turin is a natural
unit and so it does it have aluminum in
it we have probably four things about
aluminum but it's not very good for you
there have been a lot of studies that
link it's a breast cancer and
Alzheimer's is just something it you
don't want to put on your body but the
thing about natural deodorant is it's
really hard to find one that actually
works because the Luminess does you know
prevent what the native uterus it's so
cool because it's natural but it
actually works
I've tried these out before and they're
just so so great and I also smell really
good I have three to show you guys this
one is coconut and vanilla this one's
just unscented and this one is lavenders
rose so whatever scent you prefer like
they got it all and they'll do not
tested on animals which is great if
you're vegan I don't wearing a leather
jacket just you guys I cannot afford
your leavens not real so the made
without parabens which really disrupt
your natural hormonal balance they're
not very good for you and it's also
major men and women so depending on if
you are a guy or are a girl and you have
like certain part menses it's a unisex
cuter as you can all use it before I
decided to review these few pterence I
look at their ingredients and there were
things that I could actually point out
so you have the coconut oil and beeswax
the uterine is $12 online so there is
free shipping which is super duper great
so if you want to check out the even
fewer I'll have it linked down below I
we really like it and I think you're
going back to school and you do want to
make a more natural conscious choice I
think it's a great great fit now onto
the clothes I'm going to start off with
made well because made well is my
absolute favorite store I love it I just
think everything is so classy and
beautiful and it fits right this is just
an olive green bodysuit and it ties in
the front
SuperDuper tight and cute but I mainly
like these for tucking in under skirts
because it just you don't get that like
awkward ruffle like tuck something in it
just makes me a little pudgy and just
although it's really well and this one's
really comfortable I know why bodysuit
can kind of like go up your butt and
they're not comfortable but this one is
I Primrose actually got me this little
t-shirt it's just a nice little tea with
horizontal stripes and it's blue and
again I thought this was really cute
tucked into a skirt I posted a picture
on Instagram it's optional readin called
me I just thought it was really cute for
something into a skirt and Louisville
t-shirts like this I actually got this
from Nordstrom Rack but it is made well
which I even know they still made well
so definitely I got your Nordstrom Rack
if you like to achieve me well clothes
right off this dress is about $40 it's
just like a blue little linen dress and
I love this goodness can actually
transition in the fall if I throw a
cardigan over it was like some chunky
socks and some booties like this would
be such a cute New York City Hall time
outfit that's about this little t-shirt
which is just a really pretty tomato red
color I love this color I just think
it's very different it's like almost
orange but it's still red and it's just
a color not very many people wear
something it's really unique but this is
also on sale because like $20 and this
last thing with something I definitely
splurged on because I don't know about
you guys I can never find chains that
just fit right I just have more like
muscular thighs but my waist and I hips
or more narrow like I don't really have
life tips they don't have a good side
out I just kind of have like normal legs
and so jeans just don't normally look
good on me I love these I think they're
so flattering they are the button-up
jeans from made well and are high
waisted and then at the bottom there's
like a light wash and then at the bottom
they have the bonds that are kind of
like the seams are sticking out I felt
these are so cute and I put them on I
was like jeans never make me look good
they never ever
let's go but I just something looks
really good and my blog channel a ton of
you guys told me I should buy view so I
bought them they're definitely a splurge
I also got a romper that I'm wearing
right now it's just really pretty lace
romper which I'll show the trial but I
thought it was cute and I'd love
anything like girly many mixing it was
like edgy your pieces like this just
kind of cute and different I also really
love Old Navy I don't know what it is
about maybe lately but it has just been
like killing the game I want to meet
whoever does like their marketing
because they just totally rebranded Old
Navy and I love it so all that aside I
got this body con skirt which is black
and it's just very very simple it's so
like playing I think I got this for like
seventeen dollars just playing black but
stuff like this is very flattering if if
I would have isn't super solids they're
really flattering also black is really
flattering and I live in New York so
it's like everyone wears black and I
also just got the same skirt in a
horizontal stripe pattern which if you
are someone who doesn't have hips like
myself wearing horizontal stripes really
does help with that and all they usually
tell you to stay away from horizontal
stripes but if you don't have hips like
they do the job and I also got this
blouse which is just a blue and white
pattern it's really really plain simple
something I can wear to class or I can
throw like a blazer over Jean and then
lastly I got this dress which is on mega
sale I found mall clearance is literally
six dollars it's just like a raspberry
color and it's SuperDuper tight but it
goes about like probably to my knees I
would say um and it's a quarter like
please so I just thought this is great
for the fall time like it's actually
just a ploy to follow dress and all the
while I was on clearance it was
defective but I don't see anything wrong
with it
I'm gonna buy it I also stopped into
Levi's which I don't normally buy things
from Levi's but I got these and I was in
TJ Maxx I thought this stuff is so much
cheaper so I feel but always basically
teaching Asperger's because everything
was cheaper there and not be short which
are not necessarily something to go to
work class or anything but they're just
white and they're a lot longer I will
them up but I just thought they were
cute and slaughtering and I don't like
shorts only and only things that are
super short and like go up my butt on
back
don't cities are more modest short to
just bring you
Krauser rolls so pretty like those and
then I got this button-down top that has
stripes on it it's really really plain
it's something like super special but
this with a red bandana I just thought
would be really cute
I showed this in one of my outfit videos
but I just want to show it again
something is cute from Erie is really
cheap but it's just a white key that
says khaki and clean on it I just
thought it's a really cute little
t-shirt to tuck in and like dress up I
just thought it was super duper fun
another forever 21 I'm going to go
through these really quickly already
shows them and out there you know just
in case you missed it I got this skirt
which just has buttons on it
and it's a really pretty blush color I
put it a few photos in this too
literally 15 dollars I'll try to link it
down below it's so flattering and
comfortable and it's super long so you
can wear this to school I opened up
these pants which is how vertical
stripes are worth to the shawn mendes
concert but they're really comfortable
they kind of like figure out and they
tie it the waist
super flattering with the vertical
stripes going to make your life I'm not
longer from PJ max I got this little top
which I think totally gives me like
Britney Spears vibes when I cry whereas
my sister told me but it's just a
spaghetti strap top obviously I wear it
like a jean jacket over this but it has
the lines in it it's definitely tighter
this is actually for free people but is
only $12 so like I gotta go if you do
max I saw the colors we're pretty also
from TJ Maxx I got these very very cute
little shoes I'm so going to be rocking
in my business casual I think they're
beautiful little lookers they have
little roses on them and colored and
beautiful these look something like the
Gucci ones but they're like $20 so I'm
broken novel or Gucci I also have these
sandals which are just black Steve
Madden sandals that wrap up around ankle
really plain I'm doing an affordable out
this video so probably our dbl before
there's honestly maybe doing an
affordable office video so I wanted to
pick up some cheaper pieces of style and
I think they're cute I also got these
from GSW that I'm wearing a ton for the
month of July they're just the suede
slight on shoes I love playing on shoes
because they're easy they're comfortable
and this brown color is probably my
favorite family more of a brown girl
than like a block you know my moto
jacket those are all the things that I
have so far and definitely be me doing a
little bit
or shopping for back to school because I
need some more like business clothes if
you enjoyed this make sure you give me
