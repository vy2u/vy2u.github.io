do a back-to-school clothing haul and
I'm really excited to do this video
because I have purchased quite a few
things that I would like to show you
guys it's also a try on haul which are
my favorites you can actually see you
know what the pieces look like on also I
do go to school I'm gonna be a senior
next year and so I do have a dress code
so all these clothes are within my dress
code so I figured that would help you
guys out if you have a dress code as
well also I know a lot of people watch
these videos that aren't necessarily
subscribed to certain channels so if
you'd like to subscribe right now you
can hit the button right here or down
below and then you will get notified
whenever I post a video and I would
really appreciate that so it seems that
I have quite a few things to show you
guys so we're just gonna go ahead and
get into the video so Urban Outfitters I
have a lot of stuff to show you guys
because I like Urban Outfitters the
first thing I got is this t-shirt it is
just a striped tee that adds a pocket
and says New York and it's a little
cropped but not to the point where you
can't wear it with jeans it doesn't
really show any skin so really like this
it's super comfy and if you don't know
me I love New York I would like to live
there and so I figured might as well get
some apparel with the state on it I got
this sweater on sale it was actually $30
from 50 and it's just a high-low sweater
this one almost looks frayed and the
front and the back and I just thought
that was a really cute touch it also was
kind of frayed on the sleeves and I
thought this would be really cute with
like some dark wash high-waisted jeans
and these boots that I'll show you later
I just think it's really cute it's gonna
be a great piece for the whole time I
also got this really long oversized blue
and white kind of flannel tee it's a
little lighter though so I could wear it
sooner because it's really hot here in
Texas and believe me when I say it's
oversized this thing is huge it's an
extra small and it's ginormous but this
will be great with like some dark wash
black skinny jeans I got this shirt
which is just a black peplum and again
this one's a little cropped it has a
ruffled bottom it is a little crops but
you can definitely wear this
with high-waisted jeans because that's
what I did when I wore this and it's
just a very simple piece but I find
myself always wearing the simple pieces
the most so I figured this would be good
to have but the last clothing piece I
got from here is just this really big
oversized almost kind of hoody shirt I
don't know how to describe it it's like
a hoodie material it has a v-neck and
the sleeves kind of go out a little bit
this actually has a little bit of black
stuff on the back but I figured I could
wash it out it was originally I think
like 30 or 40 dollars and it was on sale
for ten so I figured I would just pick
it up and try to get that little stain
out
also on Urban Outfitters I got these
shoes which are just these kind of dusty
pink color and they're little flat shoes
and I love these I love the pointed toes
however these hurt so bad to break in I
don't know if they're just a little bit
too big so maybe that's why but I have
some killer blisters on my feet from
these but beauty is paying my friends
beauties me also want to anthropology
and I saw this shirt and told myself I
wasn't gonna buy it because it was
pretty pricey but I tried it on and it
just looked so good it is this black and
white
flowy tank top it's pretty oversized on
the bottom it goes down pretty long and
it has a turtleneck which I love
turtlenecks now they just look so classy
and it makes every outfit look way more
sophisticated so I actually posted a
picture on my Instagram wearing this and
you guys fell in love as much as I fell
in love it's just such a great shirt in
the fall time I can definitely pair this
with like an army green jacket and it
would be dress code appropriate I got
two things from Francesca's this first
shirt is just an army green button-down
very simple but it's going to be great
for the fall time with maybe some combat
boots or something it's just very
sensible but a good piece
I know I'm gonna wear I just forgot this
vest which is so cute it's just a khaki
color and it kind of I don't know what
this is called it opens up right here
and then it has pockets and some crochet
detailing so super cute and it's gonna
be great for the fall time again I keep
saying that but you gotta prepare but I
also went to Buffalo Exchange which is
kind of a high-end thrift store and I
always find the cutest best clothing
pieces there and I found this Free
People top which was actually new with
the tags originally 58 dollars and I got
it for 20 which is awesome but it's just
a almost tie-dye print top and then it
goes down into these bell sleeves which
I love bell sleeves it's a very hippie
talk not something that I normally wear
when I put this on it just fit really
well I don't know it was a really great
deal so I'm really excited to style it
at PacSun I picked up this top which is
just kind of a white Henley shirt it's
pretty big but very very soft it's
actually brandy melville the brand so
and just great for a chilled egg I
figure this with like maybe some
converse or something would be cute to
wear to school then at H&amp;amp;M I just got
one tank top which again I can throw a
cardigan over and wear it to school but
just a white top that's very flowy the
bottom kind of ruffles at the bottom but
it just fit really well why don't I put
it on and it felt really good and airy
which is great for Texas cause it is so
hot right now and I can still wear this
for a good two months before fall
actually gets here I also wear jeans
like nobody's business and so I picked
up four pairs from American Eagle about
this pair which is just a high-waisted
black pair just very simple always
wanting high-waisted black jeans and so
I got these and they fit pretty well so
I figured I'd pick them up I also got a
light pair of those jeans so they're
just the same high rise form but they
are a light wash so early like these
ones these ones are really really
comfortable more comfortable than the
black ones then I got just a simple pair
of dark wash jeggings so very simple
they just go down into a skinny jean I
wear this pairs so many times I can't
even tell you how many times I've bought
this exact same pair of jeans they just
fit really well then I got another pair
and I thought the
you're the same as the ones I just
showed you guys but unfortunately these
are way too big
they don't fit they're a different time
I just thought they were the same so
I'll have to take those back in exchange
outs and then my ultimate favorite thing
that I gots are these pair of Steve
Madden shoes they're just little
western-style booties they have a little
cutout on them which I think will be so
cute in the fall time to worth like cute
socks that peak out and because here in
Texas everyone wears cowboy boots and
they're not really my thing but I think
these are good compromise I really
wanted to be fault just like one of
these foods to be honest
now this isn't clothing so I hope you
guys aren't mad at me but I got this
planner which is from rifle Paper
Company and it's just a 2016 planner and
I fell in love with this when I looked
at it basically on every single week
there is a new quote which if you know
me you know I love me a good quote and
so there's literally one every week
right here that I can just read whenever
I'm having a bad day and the lighting
just got really weird I had a little
pulitzer planner and honestly there was
just too much junk in that one like i
didn't use the stickers i didn't use a
lot of the extra stuff it came with but
this is just very basic and I know I'm
gonna use every slot of this and not
waste any of the paper or anything so
I'd really recommend this planner I'll
have it linked down below I'm not
sponsored or anything so that's
everything that I bought I really hoped
you guys enjoyed this video make sure to
give it a like if you enjoy hauls
because I enjoyed them a lot as well I
have my back to school videos linked
down below if you'd like to check them
out or you can watch my last one which
was all about high school advice if you

guys my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
