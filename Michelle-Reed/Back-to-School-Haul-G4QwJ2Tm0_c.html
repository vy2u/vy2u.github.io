school like haul video i watch shop even
my brother and nobody's home right now
that's why I'm in my living room so the
first thing I got is from steve madden
and i ordered this from zappos cuz these
boots would literally sold out
everywhere else from like Dillard's Macy
like Steve Madden they were also now a
bit like this they're just like leather
and they're really tall and they're so
cute they have a little bit of a heel on
a but not like too much these are so
cute i love them they cannot wait to
wear these the only problem is the other
boot has black soap on it like what is
that so i don't know if i'm gonna send
them back or um if anybody knows if like
somewhere they can fix this like remove
this it's not just amazing like scratch
off either it's like it's on the boot
like I don't know if you can remove that
somehow and these were like a hundred
dollars too so that's why i don't know
if i should just send them back or what
but they're really cute I won't put like
the name right here of what these boots
are called cuz I don't really remember
yeah I got one thing from Urban
Outfitters I love urban outfitters bags
love the way they smell too that's weird
um I got a pair of sandals basically
it's warm here to like October so I can
still wear these with it like this
they're just brown they like rope so
really cute the Caliph worn out which I
like that kind of love the only reason I
really got these they were on sale for
30 which I would have never spent thirty
dollars for these but then they said ten
dollars and then when the guy rang them
up they were only like eight dollars so
these are eight bucks like these um so I
thought that was a really good deal and
they're the brant he caught I don't know
if I'm saying that right yeah it was
also tax free weekend so all this stuff
was tax free so yeah I was kind of crazy
but not too bad then I went to american
eagle i just got a couple pairs of jeans
because i really like those jeans the
first pair is just like brown ain't like
a brown gray color and I'm just gonna
cuff and then I thought they were cute
and the pockets look like this these fit
really really well on my size too and
they are the skinny low rise the price
isn't on them but I'm pretty sure they
were around forty dollars and i got
these ones which these are so cute
they're like kind of jeggings but not
too jegging ish
but they are the super-stretch skinnies
and they look like this and i also might
cut these did I got these to wear with
my boots because I can like tuck them in
really well they say the theme they were
$45 but these are on sale for 30 so last
hour I went to his H&amp;amp;M and I got four
sweaters here and I cannot wait the
first one is kind of like big loose
cream on its really really comfortable
and just really soft and I can't wait to
wear this with like some boots and so
it's really big and I got this in a size
six cuz I wanted it to be big and it was
$25 and then I got this like maroon
colored one which i'm pretty sure
strawberryelectric for da got this but
it's actually not like a burgundy this
is like such a fall color and it's
really really pretty and it's kind of
big I just like big sweaters for the
fault i feel like this is gonna be
really cute my boobs it was twenty
dollars I'm not trying to hurry up for
my brother to talk and the last sweater
I got looks like this is just like an
oatmeal color it's pretty plain nothing
too special I don't know all right Scott
this cos is comfortable and really
simple and this was twenty dollars and
the last shirt I got it's probably not
gonna come on the color it is cuz it's
like neon but it's this neon coral
stripe top coral stripe top and it looks
like this it's just really really
comfortable and I feel like this is
really cute it's coming on like orange
but it's actually like a neon cool but
I'm pretty sure that's all I got so yeah
not too much but yeah also tell me if
