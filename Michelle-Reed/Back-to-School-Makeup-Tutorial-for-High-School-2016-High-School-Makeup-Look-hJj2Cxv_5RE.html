video because it is going to be a back
to school high school makeup tutorial
which is the look that I'm wearing right
now just want to let you guys know that
this is still a full face routine and so
if you're looking for like a 5 minute
makeup routine or like a no makeup
makeup look this is not your kind of
video
honestly in high school I just liked
wearing more makeup it was fun it made
this day more enjoyable whenever I had
that time to get ready and so if you're
like me and you like wearing makeup
which I don't think is a bad thing and I
don't think we should like put each
other down for doing I think this is
great but that being said if you would
like to see one that's a little more
natural like just mascara concealer the
basics kind of the middle school makeup
tutorial it's definitely like this video
and let me know down below because I
definitely be into doing that because I
still wear my makeup like that
occasionally and like always if you're
new to my channel deftly subscribe the
button is right here and I'd love to
have you here on my channel and as you
guys are watching this I'm actually
going to be moving into my college
apartment so that's so excited you can
definitely follow me on Instagram and
Twitter and snapchat so I'm gonna be
updating you guys on there and I'm just
so so excited also wanted to tell you
guys if you're wondering what this thing
on my neck is in this video I burn it
really bad with my straightener and it's
like scabbing and it's so gross but I
couldn't figure out a way to cover it so
if you're wondering what that is that is
what that is I know it's kind of gross
yeah let's just go ahead and get into
the makeup tutorial so to start off this
look I am mixing my Aveeno positively
radiant moisturizer with eye makeup for
ever HD foundation so I'm basically just
making up my own tinted moisturizer
which I think that's a great option if
you're in high school you totally skip
foundation if you want this is just what
I'm doing but taking this on my finger
and I'm simply putting it on my face and
then I'm using my Beauty Blender to
blend this out really making sure that I
get this all over my face and also down
my neck because foundation lines are the
absolute worse
so for my brows I'm first just going in
with my naked eye shadow it's a really
nice just neutral color and I'm simply
going to kind of fill in any bald spots
in my brows I like to do this before I
apply any gels because I find that gels
can kind of get kinked up and this just
kind of works better for me and then
after that I use my Holy Grail products
I love this it is benefits gimme brow
and it's basically just a spoolie with a
little bit of brow gel in it and this
makes your brows so much thicker if
you're someone who likes like really
thick brows I think this product is
perfect so now on to concealer I am
using my instant age rewind concealer
this is the brightener one and I'm first
just going to apply this underneath my
eye but I just use this underneath my
eyes and kind of a downward sloping
triangle and then I'm also applying it
to my lids to go ahead and conceal
as you can see I have one little lone
pimple that showed up last night so if
you do have any spots you can go in with
a concealer this is my benefit Boyan
concealer to set my under eyes I like to
use a pressed powder so I'm using the
Rimmel stay matte powder and I'm
applying this under my eyes I find that
using a pressed powder under my eyes
just works better and then using a lift
other for the rest of my face then I'm
using the NYX mineral Senate don't fret
its powder which is great miss applying
this to my face very lightly to set my
foundation silver bronzer I'm not going
to do any heavy contouring or anything
I'm simply taking my Vita liparota
bronzing powder which is more like a
self-tanner than a bronzer and I'm just
picking this up on my kabuki brush and
I'm lightly gonna put this on my
cheekbones I'm also blending this on
kind of wherever else I want to be a
little bit tanner I usually like to do
it right here on my jaw but on my
forehead around my hairline basically
all over my face but it just gives me
more of a tan lot and I'm also blending
this down my neck so it doesn't look
like a complete another shade and that's
our blush I'm using my 10 color blush
palette from Coastal Scents I haven't
used this thing and forever it's using
this one in the corner here and then
just because I like a little bit of
highlight I'm using Mac soft and gentle
and I'm highlighting all my cheekbones
my chin and the bridge of my nose
honestly I would just go like this you
can totally stop it right here but I'm
gonna go on to eyeshadow if you feel
like wearing eyeshadow I'm using my
Naked 3 palette which has beautiful
beautiful just mob colors and I'm taking
the shade limits and I'm applying this
in my crease and then I'm going in with
a shade nooner which is beautiful and
I'm applying this in kind of my outer
crease / outer corner and I just like to
flick it inwards a little bit to get a
little bit of dimension and then we're
just gonna blend those colors out really
quick and then for my shade and light
palette I'm using this really pretty
cream shade and I'm just going under my
brow and I'm also gonna take that shade
onto my lid just to brighten it up a
little bit
and I'm skipping eyeliner and I'm just
going straight to mascara this is the
Maybelline lash stiletto I think if you
like more natural lashes this mascara is
perfect Santi Nancy is just very natural
but they're really pretty I think this
mascara is great for people like more
natural lashes or like just we're
keeping it very simple and I'm using my
airy-fairy lipstick from Rimmel a
beautiful beautiful shimmery kind of
pinky nude definitely just a staple
lipstick that I wear all the time
I think I'm gonna put a gloss over this
this is the wet-and-wild gloss and the
shade jaci a la mode I'm pretty sure
this is from their back-to-school
collection but I really like it it's a
pretty like baby pink I think it goes
great over a nude lipstick and I my
staple I just like to set everything
with the Smashbox photo finish primer
water great for school I know your
makeup can totally wear off throughout
the date so a setting spray is probably
like one of my number one tip so that is
it for this makeup tutorial I really
hope you guys enjoyed it this is gonna
be my go-to look in college definitely
and I think it's great for those who
like to be a little more glam and stuff
