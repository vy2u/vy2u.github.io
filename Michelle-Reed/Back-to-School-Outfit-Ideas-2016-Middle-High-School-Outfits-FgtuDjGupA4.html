night someone hi guys in today's video
I'm going to be showing you guys my
favorite back-to-school outfit ideas now
I know that back to school so many
different people have different dress
codes and styles and it's really hard to
find outfits that you like it so I
picked four that were pretty different
and all in different dress codes so it
would better fit you guys and help you
guys because I know a lot of these
videos people were in like crop tops and
really short shorts and obviously like a
lot of us came with it to school so I
really hope this helps you guys as
always if you're new you should
definitely subscribe the buttons right
here and I upload twice a week and I
really like for you guys to stick around
because I have so much fun I'm making
YouTube videos and I know you guys would
enjoy them so yeah let's just go ahead
and get into the video so this first
outfit is definitely super duper cute
but it's also casual because it's a
skirt paired with some tennis shoes so
this is great for you guys who like to
be cute You've casual my turtleneck top
is so cute it's from brandy melville I
love it it tucks perfectly into this H&amp;amp;M
skirt which has the button detailing
which I personally really really like I
think they go great together and then my
little tennis shoes are from Urban
Outfitters
I love these they were like $15 they're
my favorites and then my necklace is
from Francesca's and my purse is from
Madewell if you're wondering but I'm
wearing it with all these outfits this
one is definitely my favorite outfits I
love it and I think it's super cute
especially for the first day of school
if you guys have a dress code I think
this outfit is perfect because it is a
little more formal and kind of business
casual I like it because it is
professional but the colors make it
super fun at the same time so my little
crop top is from Urban Outfitters it's
just floral and it goes great with these
pants which I know Michelle you're
wearing orange pants kind of crazy but I
really like these they're from American
Apparel and they're SuperDuper
comfortable and in my opinion they're
comfier than jeans my little cardigan is
from brandy melville and I think it does
make this a little bit more casual and
then my shoes are from j.crew and my
watch is the brand Yoda and again I'm
just wearing the same Madewell
purse and then the necklaces that I
always wear which I'll have them down
below this next outfit is for you guys
who are definitely more casual and
sporty this is like kind of your average
school outfit my top is from made well
it just says manana I think it's really
cute I wear it like every day these
jeans are from Topshop they are the
Jamie jeans and I love the rips and the
knees definitely one of my favorites I
think black high-waisted jeans are
flattering and they look good on
everybody and then my favorite part of
this outfit my super cute high-top
converse that are all white I love these
and then I'm just wearing the same
fossil watch from earlier this last
outfit is definitely my most me outfit
this is something I would wear to school
because I like getting dressed up for
school and I think this one is so chic
and classy my shirt dress is from made
well I think it's so pretty
I paired it with this necklace from
Francesca's which I really like the pop
of gold color and then I'm also wearing
another fossil watch again with my
Madewell purse and then these shoes
which are from Steve Madden I purchased
these last year though so I'm not sure
if they're still available but they're
so cute and western and I think they
give me my little Texas player but yeah
this one is definitely one of my
favorites
so I really hope you guys enjoyed
watching this I had a ton of fun filming
it for you guys here's the outfits

favorite to do so it was really fun
