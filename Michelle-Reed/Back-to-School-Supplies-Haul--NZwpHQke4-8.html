school haul video I go back to school
August 27th if you're wondering and yeah
I went shopping with my brother
yesterday to get my school supply here
my hair's gonna like catch on fire I
also wanted to show you guys my school
bag it looks like this it's just black
it's from Victoria Secret Pink
it's like buckles right here and yeah
once I get like into school and like
have all my stuff organized organized
I'll do a what's in my school bag video
also how my school works is um you don't
know exactly what you need until the
first day of school so this is the stuff
that I think I'm going to use so first I
just have like binders and stuff the
first one is just like this pink one oh
and I also want to office seat both I
didn't mention that uh munoz like this
pastel yellow ones and then I just got
this like green one and then I got two
packs of colorful paper this is just
college of love obviously and then I got
a pencil bag which I don't know why I
got this because I'm gonna use a makeup
bag that I use blasts here cuz it's
still okay then I got four five star
folders I have to use these five star
ones because they're the best and they
didn't have very pretty colors so yeah I
got a pink one I tried to like color
coordinate with my binders but that kind
of failed then I have an orange one this
one's really ugly looks like earwax but
all the pretty colored ones did have
Brad's and I had to have ones with
breath so I got this turquoise moment I
was like ooh this is pretty second I
just put it in the cart and didn't
notice that it doesn't up Brad's but I'm
sure I'll find a use for that somewhere
then I got a black one because then I
got these notebooks these are the
five-star three subject one's this one's
black I got a green one and then I got a
turquoise new one I also got a
competition but I need this for either
biology or English so then I got two
sets of dividers this is really
tellers just because I need those for my
binders then I got like utensils in the
South in the cold myself this bag is um
I got some scissors these are just
colored pencils it's the small pack and
I got these highlighters so look how
pretty the colors are I really like
these are really big I like really big
highlighters too and then I got these
big pencils which I didn't notice 4.91
so they're really thick so probably end
up taking these back to get point seven
but I like these vessels or might just
keep them I got a glue stick these are
just post-it notes because I needed
these for drill team and the colors are
pretty then I got these pens because
they have blue black in red all in one
pack because I needed all three of those
colors and then the last thing I got are
these sharpies they're like the
double-sided one so ones fine point and
anything service like the regular size
so that is everything I got it hope you
