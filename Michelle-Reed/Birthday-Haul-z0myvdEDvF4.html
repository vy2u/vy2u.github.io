birthday haul because my birthday was
July first if you didn't know and this
was super duper requested just on all my
social media science and just in the
comments of my videos you know anything
about me I love to do requested videos
I'm all about that so I decided to go
ahead and do this I mean who doesn't
really like haul nobody my birthday was
July first if you didn't know and thank
you for all the birthday wishes on all
of my sites and everything it means so
much to me I'm 15 if you didn't know
that's how old I was turning so yeah
let's just go ahead and get started so I
just want to start off with the big gift
that I got I asked for studio lights for
my parents absolutely hate having to
film in this setup because it's my
window if you don't know here i will
show you guys my setup right now it's
it's it's embarrassing and I've just
always wanted to film from my bed or my
vanity so I got studio lights so I don't
have to worry about having bad lighting
so they come in these black bags and
they're from cowboy studios and they're
just the softbox lighting i will link
the down below if you're interested if
you're wondering why I'm not filming
with them it's because I forgot to order
the stands that the lights actually go
on to though I had to reorder those and
I'm just waiting for them to come in
thank you so much mom and dad for these
because I cannot cannot cannot wait to
build with these i also got two light
bulbs or the lights because i'm pretty
sure you have specific light bulbs for
them these are just the 65 watts at
white you might show you guys like bulbs
I don't know where my sister jamie i got
a starbucks gift for which i've already
spent like half of because i love
starbucks of coffee you see sings like
nobody's business she also got me the
Stila in the light palette which i'm so
excited about because i haven't bought
myself like high and makeup and a long
time so the palette itself looks like
this and it just comes with a bunch of
really pretty neutral eye shadows and
that's what i'm wearing today if you're
wondering i kind of just did a neutral
look overall today i absolutely love
kitten the best because it's the perfect
champagne eyeshadow you want a tutorial
with this palette make sure to tell me
and I do like it back to school like
high school makeup tutorial with this
because I feel like it's really great
for teenagers Jamie's my older sister by
the way if you didn't know
still Lindsay bought me this dress and
I'm wearing and i'll go ahead and show
that right now but it's just a really
soft floral white dress it's so comfy
it's like the perfect summer dress and I
absolutely bought it it's from urban
outfitters and it's so gorgeous she also
got me to do polishes from earn
outfitters because I'm a nail polish
junkie the first one is in love letter
and it's a super neon coral probably not
coming on camera as neon as it is but I
have this on my toes and I absolutely
love it it's like more of a neon orange
though than a coral she also lots after
hours which is a beautiful shimmery
color it's got like purple pink and
green and I had this on my ring finger a
couple days ago but I really really like
this and I like these two together to
really pretty so I brother Jordan it got
to me a target gift card because you can
never go wrong with target I've already
spent it I've got a few things so i'll
go ahead and show you we stay matte
powder from rebel this is my all-time
favorite powder and i just ran out of my
rough a long one so i think sup this I
love it it's just an awesome powder I
got the elf blending I brush which I've
already have three to the use I don't
know why I keep buying these because I
think that I don't have them and then I
go over and I like three of them some
really knows wrong with me after the
blotting sheets from ELF because my
friend emily's obsessive blotting sheets
and she inspired me so yeah these are
like green tea ones I think they look
like this and yeah just kind of blah I
just got to I got three what the heck
yep I like these alright just dropped it
i also got me needling one by one
mascara because every time i go to the
drugstore and i run out of mascara i get
anyone so i don't like to use the same
one because i kind of all do the same
thing and obviously i got a pair of
shoes which were on clearance for like
fifteen dollars i think but i needed
these two of the dress that will show
you as I can't but they are just a nude
pumps and they have pointy toes because
I feel like you're pointed toes were
more like classy than round toes but
they're the Grand Massimo and I don't
know if these are still on sale but it's
been a bit of a perfect nude pumps and I
don't have any classic heels like this
so I decided think he's up so also i got
this dress custom-made for me off of her
ecomme someone from saying over you
don't link down below but she custom
made me this dress and it's so pretty
it's like a blue
lace just super classy dress so pretty I
needed this for a wedding that I'm going
to and I have to wear Navy so she cuz i
made this with my measurements and then
i just chose a color and she made it and
it's so gorgeous i'm not going to show
like a full body with this on because i
think I'm already gonna have a video up
wearing this and then I really like the
back because it has like a deep v neck
it's so gorgeous and I just love it it's
so classy I know it's not everybody
style and it kind of looks weird when
you're just holding it up but sober day
so I like this down below absolutely
love it but I think I'd have a video on
it oh so the last thing I'll show you
guys i recently got this phone case this
is kind of just a present to myself i
had a gift card but is on it but it's
the peak pineapple phone case and I know
like every youtuber has this but it's
soaking you and I had a gift card and
none of what this sweats or anything fit
me so I just decided to get this one and
it's so cute it has like some losses and
it's a pineapple and I like the front
it's like make green everybody to making
fun of me for this because I think it's
stupid but I love this and you should

roxina video in a while so I decided to
show her she's so much bigger hey Fox
