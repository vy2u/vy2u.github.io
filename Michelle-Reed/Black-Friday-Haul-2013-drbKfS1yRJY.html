hey guys today I'm going to be doing my
black friday haul for 2013 I did one of
these last year I went shopping at about
4am this morning till about seven and so
I wanted to show you guys what I got
because I know this would be requested
to do so I just decided to go ahead and
do it I didn't really go that crazy I
know some people go ham on black friday
and they just go insane I'm not really
one of those people I just got a few
things here and there that I decided to
show you guys so yeah I'm just going to
go ahead and get started so I went to
eddie bauer forever 21 H&amp;amp;M airy and
about what he works i'm going to start
off with bath and body works I got two
of the mason jar candles these were 2
for 15 and they're originally twelve
dollars each so thought that was a cute
that was a cute deal and I think these
are so cute cuz they're a little mason
jars but the first one I got is
sparkling icicles and this honestly just
smells like Cologne that's really only
why I bought it it smells so good it
smells like clothing has a lot to soup
ever of it because this is my favorite
Christmas sent and it just smells like
straight-up peppermint I kind of just
like the fall candles but these two I
decided to pick up for the winter time
and I'm pretty much set on candles now
so then I went to eddie bauer and
everything at eddie bauer is forty
percent off and they have really cute
flannels so i went ahead and bought one
and it looks like this it's just red
green and black and it's very Christmasy
and I'm love flannel it was free person
awesome i'll put the prices down
somewhere but absolutely love this and i
got it in a medium so it'd be a little
big so i went to H&amp;amp;M and the bag is so
pretty you like look at it and then it
is aqua pretty bags just make the
shopping experience better the first
thing i got is a dress and I don't
really buy dresses so this is different
but it's just a navy blue lace dress and
it should lead and it kind of just goes
down it's very simple very plain but I
feel like I can dress it up and make it
thank you if it's made really really
well and I just love it so much and the
lace feels very like nice lace I don't
know does it feel cheap put your link I
then bought this cardigan and it's just
gray white and black and it kind of
drapes down I've always wanted one of
these a drapey type cardigans if you
know I'm saying just that's very very
comfortable and I got it in a large so
it'd be very big and comfy and
absolutely love it it's very soft the
last thing i got is another sweater and
it's very very simple it's just white
and black it's very big I'm in the back
cuz buttons on it I thought that was
very cute yeah they absolutely love it I
like this would be good for a simple day
when I just want to throw this awesome
boobs and not really put work into my
outfit because that's everyday so then I
went to carpet 21 and I actually got a
deal here so that's exciting I got this
sure which is obviously the coolest
shirt ever it looks like a jacket but
it's like a military green color make an
army green color and then it has a red
flannel on it it's so good it's so me
and I love it it's just a button down
and it fits me perfectly and i love it i
just found this in the middle of clutter
and i was like a lot but it was
originally 2980 it has one see over
twenty dollars so it was a very good
deal I'd end up these pants and before
you judge me I've always wanted to wear
these pants and I didn't think I could
pull it off so just when I had to try
them on and I bought them so they're
like the MC Hammer tight pants and they
look like this they're just like beige
and black and they're so comfortable
they have an elastic band and they kind
of flare like around your thighs and
then they close in on your ankles and so
zips right there but they're so
comfortable and I've seen people wear
these and they look so cute so I decided
I I try wear them
but they're literally amazing and I love
them and I really hope I can pull them
off and I can wear them in public
because I they're so cute to me and then
I just got a scarf and this was on sale
for six dollars i thought why not but
it's just great and maroon and it's just
all one so is this an infinity scarf
what's the difference between an
infinity it is circle scarf or they're
the same thing because this is just all
one i think it's an infinity i don't
know but you just put it on once you
don't have to worry about wrapping it
and it's very soft and cozy very simple
and I by too many scarf so so now what's
a victoria secret i didn't buy anything
because honestly I'm not really into the
whole hoodie and lugging staying anymore
but I did get this because my sister
bought a tote bag and if you spent like
seventy dollars or something you could
get a tote bag as well but I didn't we
thought it was free though but you had
to pay like an additional toy dog or
something so I bought this to make it
seventy dollars but ended up not working
I don't know it's hard explaining but
this is a ultimate hand treatment which
I mean honestly can always use solutions
so I just you know whatever I don't know
really why I bought this but tears no no
its area area was having a great sale
everything was fifty percent off its I
wish I bought more but I only about one
thing they are these little like sleep
shorts and they have polar bears armed
and they're so cute and they're like a
flannel material I guess and they little
ruffles on the bottom I love them and
they're so cute and they weren't eight
dollars so i thought why not and I know
it's a winner and I should be my pajama
pants but I honestly it's so hot when I
sleep I remember it's so hot and so
shorts are just a better option and so I
bought these and they're super
comfortable and I probably order tonight
because they're so cute cozy how can you
resist polar bear sleep you can't the
last thing i got i actually ordered off
on the site called choice i love toys
the sweater i'm wearing is from there
right now they're the most unique close
a link
down below but I bought this sweater and
it's literally a polar bear sweater like
is so soft and it's ombre down it's so
fuzzy and it sheds it on and i love it
it's amazing it's the comfiest thing in
the world and i love it so much I
haven't already yet though because I
don't really know how to wear it because
it's a little I don't know fuzzy but
it's incredible and I love it asked
about two other things but I already
show that in my outfit of the week's
video and so I just decided to show
those because you've already seen those
about yep so that is everything I got I
really hope you guys enjoyed this if you
