you want to see me blogging for the
first time ever you should definitely
check that out
and we're just going to go ahead and get
into the important stuff aka the whole
in this video I was shopping at about 8
o'clock this morning just because I like
to sleep in and I didn't really feel
like getting up early this year so I got
a few things I didn't get a ton of stuff
but I got enough stuff where I'm happy I
got some pretty good deals first I went
to was Paxton now the whole packs on
store is 40% off which isn't the best
deal for me because I feel like a lot of
stores already do that but brandy
melville was 25% off guys brainy the
little never goes on sale so I got a few
things just because I noticed brandy
melville stuff is always the stuff I
wear the most so the first thing I got
is this dress which is kind of a grayish
color and just goes down it's a t-shirt
dress it's something that I can wear
with leggings and it's just easy to wear
and I really really like it it was $27
but it's 25% off so you can do them a
half it was cheaper and I really liked
it this next thing though is my favorite
thing I got from Brady Melville it is a
wine color to suede dress there goes the
bag it is a wine colored suede dress
that just goes down a belt a little
longer than mid thigh so it's a good
length I think this color is so pretty
for the Christmas time and I'm just so
excited to wear this with black leggings
and some black boots and it's going to
be so cute so I also got a sweater from
brandy melville it is
a v-neck sweater it's pretty oversized
and it's shutting everywhere right now
but it's fuzzy and comfy and just one of
the sweaters that you will always wear
so I figured I'd go ahead and think this
up it was really cute I also went to
Airy which again was 40% off but not the
best sale but I did like this blanket
scarf it is such a pretty color it has
like pink and red and navy blue and gold
it's so awesome and really really fuzzy
I just wanted a big scarf to bundle up
with because it's been getting kind of
cold here in Texas guys I think it was
$30 and it was 40% off that so whatever
that is that is how much this was I also
got a pair of boots from this little
like off-broadway shoe store but it
looks like this whatever that brand is I
can't really read it but I got these
black suede boots I've been waiting for
a while now the kind of trending right
now but they're just over the knee boots
so they go right here they're over the
knee and I love these they're like suede
in the front and then stretchy in the
back I think these are gonna be so cute
with like an all-black ensemble kind of
what I'm wearing right now so these are
only fifty dollars I don't know if they
were on sale or anything but there are
like $50 I've stopped them such a good
deal they're originally 100 and I am so
excited to style these in a fashion
video coming up definitely like a winner
lookbook it's a give you so excited
right now also was it Bath and Body
Works cuz I feel like if you go Black
Friday shopping you just have to go to
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works the whole store was
buy three get three free which is insane
and so I got three things and then three
other things I split between my sisters
because I'm shopping with them first I
just got the winter candle which I've
had before and I burned completely
through it and smells kind of just like
woods pine needles icy mandarin and
winter wood so very crisp it's really
nice to burn just in your room and I
also got another candle this one is
champagne toast I've had this before too
and I burned completely through it so
it's more of a New Year's candle but
it's just a very sweet light sense if
you're not one for those thick musky
vanilla
and this one's really good it kind of
just smells like juicy nectarine and
black crimped current but it's a really
good scent and I've had before so I know
I liked it and then I just needed
something to grab because it was one
more thing that we had to get that was
free and so I got this pair of fuzzy saw
and some dogs on it because when you see
fuzzy socks with dogs on them you don't
pass it up guys so these are really
comfy I've had a lot of these before you
end up losing them but I'm determined
not to lose this pair then I went to
Sephora support really wasn't having any
sales it was just like certain sets for
ten dollars or something so I actually
needed a new beauty blender because mine
is so dirty guys it is so gross I'm
gonna do a close-up because mine has
these little black dots in it a little
concern I think it might be mold which
is gross but sometimes I will put it in
a plastic drawer after I'm done using it
it's still kind of thing up so I don't
know if that would make these dots you
guys should let me know if yours has
this problem because I don't want this
one to have that problem and now you're
supposed to switch them out but they're
like twenty dollars and I feel kind of
crazy spending forty dollars on the
sponges but and then we had a 500-point
perk things so I got the Urban Decay
vices little palette which has really
pretty just purple gunmetal shades
they're kind of shimmery but really good
for this time of the year so it also
came with a little glide on pencil and
the brown shade I also picked up the
hand food hydrating hand cream I have
super dry hands and so this stuff is
awesome it's not greasy which a lot of
people said was like wow I know my crazy
lotion I'm gonna try this so I did it
it's awesome I think it was about four
dollars but it is so nice and I would so
recommend this if you have really dry
hands and you know that's everything I
got from support also stop by target a
couple days ago not on Black Friday but
I got these sunglasses which I really
like they are tortoiseshell
not sure what this shape is but I really
like them I leave sunglasses like in
nobody's business and so I never like to
buy expensive ones but what is going on
I don't like to buy expensive one so I
figured this pair would just be good for
driving and what doesn't and then last
week I also got a few other things that
I figured I just throw into this haul
video I went to Urban Outfitters and I
got this poncho which I took my senior
pictures in I'm shopping to music right
here of it on but it's a really pretty
tan color it has stripes in it and it's
about quarter length sleeves and so I
wore it with this shirt actually
underneath and I think it looks pretty
nice but so soft so comfy this in the
sales section so I was like heck yeah I
want to buy that and then I got this
sweater which is a black kind of
oversized cardigan pretty simple
definitely something that I splurged on
it's just one of those things that you
always wear and you're always in your
closet you're like man I wish I had a
huge sweater to throw on and I'm like
now I do so I figured I just picked that
up and then lastly I got this sweater
which is a huge Aztec tribal one I think
I wore this my last video but it's
ginormous I got this from Nordstrom Rack
it was something on sale but I love the
colors and it's just so comfy and as you
can tell I love my comfy sweaters so
that was everything that I bought if
you've got any really good Black Friday
deals let me know because I'm not the
best know person but I love hearing
about it from other people
