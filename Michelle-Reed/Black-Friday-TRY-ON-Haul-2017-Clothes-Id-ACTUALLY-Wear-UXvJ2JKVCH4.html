because it's going to be my Black Friday
clothing haul video actually went at
like 12 o'clock in the afternoon I
didn't even go super early in the
morning or anything I'm especially
excited for this one because I feel like
I watch a lot of these it's always like
random stuff that people wouldn't
actually buy but stuff they just bought
because it was on sale and so in this
video I'm trying to show you my stuff
that like I would actually wear and
things that really actually cute and
like I actually wanted to wear it just
things that I bought because like they
were on sale if you're wondering on my
background it's a little bit different
today because I've actually at my
grandma's house I'm also filming a
really fun week in my life video which
I'm really excited for you guys to see
because it is so cute that's coming next
week so definitely subscribe and also
while I've been here I've been posting
so much on my Instagram stories you
should also follow me on Instagram I
also want to let you guys know that I'm
doing vlogmas as well so make sure to
subscribe to my vlog channel is Michelle
Auto Show I've never done it fully but
this year I'm really gonna try to do the
first place I'm starting with is j.crew
basically I went to the factory store
and it was also an outlet store and so
they were having 60% off everything
which is such a good deals the biggest
purchase that I made was this jacket
I've been eating a jacket that's not
like a parka but it's more cute but good
when it's like 40 degrees because mine
is so old it's from Zara but it's like
paper-thin I got this one it's just this
camel colored jacket has a really nice
collar on it and it goes about to like a
little bit above your knee does
originally like $300 but it was 60% off
so ended up being about like a 98 I
think which is such a good deal for a
jacket like this I also wear skirts like
every day to class I just like them a
lot better than dresses and so I got
this skirt which is like a khaki color
and it just goes in at the waist and I
think that these are really cute to wear
with tights I think this was originally
$70 I got 60% off that so I'll put the
price of what this ended up being and
then I also got this one which is black
and velvet because I'm obsessed with
velvet right now along with the whole
rest of the world I think this is so
cute especially for the Christmas time
it's almost $75 and it ended up
being around 60% off whatever that was
and living in New York it is freezing
and so like scarves aren't even
something that like are meant to be cute
you actually have to wear them because
it's so cold so I got this really big
blanket scarf and I thought the pattern
was really pretty with the plaid but
it's also still a pain I wear the same
pink one literally all the Thailand sort
of picture you guys know I literally
wear it all time this was originally
like $40 and then it was 60% off that I
also stopped by made well made well is
literally my favorite store I think
everything that made well is so cute
made ball was having 25% off everything
which is pretty good for them I
purchased this dress and it's like a
knit dress and I thought the colors I
was so pretty it's like blue it also has
one of these mock necks which I think
are really really cute as well when I
wear this to beautycon and Dallas as I
got this shirt which is just a nice like
plaid button-down short sleeve shirt I
wear this all the time I really like to
tie it with high-waisted jeans I think I
got it for around like $15 so on Black
Friday for their actual sale I got the
bodysuit that I'm wearing right now I
think it's really cute it's just like a
lavender color and it's v-neck and it's
long-sleeve and I love these for tucking
into like jeans and stuff I just think
they look really nice I picked up this
this was literally like eight dollars I
got this top which is definitely like
kind of quirky but I thought it would be
cute tucked into black jeans it's just
like this vertical striped shirt and it
has like these little eyes on it which I
just thought were really quirky and cute
this was fifty dollars but I use my
student discount so it was 15% off that
which I thought was a good deal
and lastly I made well I bought this
dress which I wore on Thanksgiving and
it's just this stray dress that also
kind of looks like an oversized like
pajama dress but with boots if you style
it I think he can be really cute so this
was I think $80 and it was 15% off that
and also since I'm in Ohio we stopped by
the Buckeye corner which is like the
Ohio State sword my family is a huge
Ohio State fan and so I got my boyfriend
something for Ohio State in case he ever
is over while we're watching the game he
has something to wear and so I just got
him this really big like oversized
crewneck
steal because it's really comfy huge but
now we went to American Eagle an
American Eagle who was crazy because
they were having 40% off I also got a
free blanket for spending $75 but I gave
it to my sister because I didn't think
is that cute but first went to arey and
I got these little pajamas because I
always like to get Christmas pajamas and
so these ones are just red white striped
and it comes with like this little
almost like sleep shirt hoodie type puri
night I got this and this was $35 but it
was 40% off that and then it came with
the leggings which were $20 and then 40%
off that and so they're just these
striped leggings which I think you're
cute they like little candy canes but if
you wear these together they look so
funny my whole family was making fun of
me and tiny I looks like Where's Waldo
but I think they're really cute and
Christmassy else one of these sleep
shirts which were 15 dollars and then
40% off that they're just like grey
little sleep shorts they're really tight
and small but these are just kind of for
lounging around also cut this sweater I
thought this a while ago but it was 40%
off when I bought it so I figured I'd go
ahead and put it in here but it's just
this pink sweater which is like a
chenille material but it's so soft and
it has little balloon sleeves but this
is really cute with high-waisted jeans

got for Black Friday let me know down
