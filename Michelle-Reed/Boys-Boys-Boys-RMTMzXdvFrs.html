about these species of men I mean boys
every time I asked for your advice video
topics the number one thing is always
boys and relationships and just talking
about everything that has to do with the
opposite sex and so today I decided that
I would finally just do one of these
guys advice videos now first of all I'm
not an expert I don't think anybody will
ever be an expert upon the species of
men but I do think that I do have some
tips and advice and I am a teenage girl
so I've dealt with guys before so I know
your struggle and your worries so I
think that I can kind of sort of resolve
them so I asked for some questions on
Instagram and so if you want to be part
of my advice videos make sure you follow
me I will link it down below so without
further ado I'm just gonna go ahead and
get into the questions so one of the
questions that I got a lot of Amaka
dimension is dis event username bunch of
people asked it but how to know if a guy
likes you and I think that this is kind
of just probably the number one question
when it comes to guys for me personally
I think it is very hard to find out if a
guy likes you and I'm not really one for
playing games and having to figure out
because I think that's stupid so for me
personally I would just straight up ask
if you've been talking to this guy for a
while now and you feel like you know
there may be a chance he likes you just
ask it and say hey like is this going
somewhere or you know I want to be doing
here like what do you like me just ask
something like that because I don't
think it's worth the time and effort of
mysteriously trying to figure out if he
likes you I think that's stupid
and I think you should just know if he
likes you and if you want to take things
further so I would just straight up ask
angry wind Inc asked how to start
talking to a boy especially when you
guys have classes but you never talk if
you sit by each other in class or
something you know you can always figure
something out it's like asking for help
on something is always a good thing
hopefully he knows how to do stuff if he
doesn't then just pretend you smart
because you know maybe ask to borrow
something from him just that's something
that's very simple to start talking just
something really simple something that
doesn't sound like you like him but just
talking to him I think try having
conversations if he starts one and then
keep it going and don't kind of stop the
conversation if you know in a nice mile
it's Athena asked when do you know it's
the right time to have a boyfriend and
you know what teenager should you start
I don't think that's something that is
different for each person because for me
personally I consider myself mature for
my age has a lot of people are like
Michelle you're 15 like what the heck I
thought you were 17 but yes I am 15 and
I guess going into high school I felt
like I hadn't sure you level to start
dating but it's definitely different for
each person I know some people don't
want high school relationships and they
don't agree with them and that's fine I
mean that's them but it's all depends on
the person if you think you can handle a
relationship and you can handle being
hurt Marley Lucas asked how to talk to a
boy and not be nervous um I don't think
that's possible I think that sense of
being comfortable comes with knowing
someone for a while and it does take
quite a bit of time differently you just
turn on your roles and be yourself
around someone so when you first starts
on the new guy I don't think you're
gonna have that comfortable feeling you
just have to keep getting to know them
all so I think that sense of like
nervousness and little butterflies you
get I think that's all part of talking
first time I think I'm like that I think
that's something that comes with a new
person you're talking to so I like it
and I think just give it some time and
eventually you will become comfortable
with someone Christina they new low ISM
so I can say that Rowling asked how do
you know when he's losing interest
another thing that's kind of hard I
think like I said earlier I keep
repeating this I think you just have to
ask because sometimes you'll think
someone is losing interest and you'd be
like oh I'm so boring they hate me you
know why am I even talking to that but
really he's just busy and can't give
some long response and so I don't think
you should just assume he's losing
interest if his messages get shorter or
they're not as entertaining that doesn't
necessarily mean he's not interested it
could mean that he's busy but at the
same time those short messages with not
a lot of meaning could mean that he is
losing interest in you I think that's
just when you have to tell yourself that
it's gonna be okay Isabella and then
Capps I feel like guys are never into me
what gives this just kind of hurts me
like when someone says I I'm just like
no that's not the case but being a
teenager guys are still I'm sure and
they still don't know what they want and
they're still just going for you know
the cookie cutter girl and so when
you're in high school don't get defeated
if you don't have a ton of guy friends
or a boyfriend because I think that's so
stupid when girls think they need to
have a guide to complete them because
it's not the case as I guarantee when
you grow up and you go to college you're
gonna find a guy who's mature and
appreciates you
it is high school it's only high school
and things will change
a prophecy Rachael reach asked what are
good conversation starters to a boy you
never met before something I really like
to do is I like to ask people questions
or guys questions I guess you can ask
anyone everyone likes to talk about
themselves it's
but starting a conversation with a guy
just asking questions you're curious
about it doesn't have to be stuff that's
like really inappropriate or oh they're
nothing like that but just stuff you're
interested about don't always have the
cookie cutter hey what's up nothing
how are you conversation cutting that
gets boring really easily and so just
start asking questions and I don't think
he'll think it's weird Hannibal joy he's
talking about itself so definitely just
ask questions I think it's another
person Shawn he would ask what's the
number-one thing not to do in first
dating enjoy I would say don't totally
throw yourself at him and be like I love
you we're gonna be together forever
we're gonna get married to have children
that's not the way to go I feel like a
lot of girls do that when they first
start dating yeah oh it's my first
boyfriend that's my first lover I stay
together in that's not the case I think
you should just take things slow it's
still showing that you like it but you
know courts don't present attached to it
Lee sergeant Ashton you get super
dressed up on your first date I don't
think you should this is probably the
first time he's really gonna see you and
get to know you and so I think you
should look like yourself maybe a little
nicer you know put some effort into your
appearance but you know look nice for
him and look like you are happy to be
there but don't make yourself into
another person because you want to be
you and you want to look like how
normally do and sans asked what do you
do when your boyfriend hasn't told his
parents that you're dating but you
really want you to now this is a key
that he is not serious by your
relationship because Talia's parents
that he's dating another girl is pretty
important and I think that's definitely
something that has to happen for a
relationship so you need to tell him
that he needs to tell his parents about
you or we can tell you goodbye
because that's ridiculous so I would
make sure to tell him to go ahead and do
that right now
Emma Martin 23 asks you guys like you
and girls to first now I'm not a guy so
I can't really answer for this but I
don't see the problem in girls texting
in diapers I think it's a balance of
both and personally my boyfriend doesn't
not like when I texted first he likes it
because that's a chance to talk to me
and if you're the guy you're talking to
a guy you should want to talk to you and
so I feel like fixing him first
doesn't mean you're desperate or too
clean I think it just means you want to
talk to him which isn't a problem so
Mikayla Allbritton
asks is it done to be in a relationship
when you're a teenager um I don't think
it's done by any means I think a lot of
people make it seem dumb and do really
stupid things and relationships I think
a lot of times here on YouTube a lot of
girls that give off the I hate guys and
guys are immature in high school or high
school relationships are stupid and I
really don't agree with that because I'm
really stupid and I'm immature sometimes
and so I don't think it's fair to just
call on guys and make them seem like
they're sure I agree with it I think
it's fine today in high school everybody
has different opinions but me personally
I don't see the problem so I think my
camera is about to die so I'm gonna go
ahead and say goodbye even though I wish
I could answer more questions definitely
if you have a more specific question you
want to ask I'm just calming it down
below and I will try to apply to it not
promising but I will try very hard in
the end boys will be boys and no one
ever understands them
this is the best advice I can give so I
hope you guys enjoyed this and I'll see
you guys my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
