question that I've really been pondering
lately and I really need an answer
recently I have fallen under the spell
of British youtubers and I think we can
all agree that British youtubers are
probably the most addicting thing here
on the YouTube world I'm just coming to
y'all because I don't know why there is
such an obsession with British youtubers
I am one of these obsessed fan girls
that is addicted to every British use of
red I want to ask you why because I
can't understand the only British
youtuber is no matter how attractive
they are which for the majority of the
time they are super attractive junk food
even if they're not physically attracted
they're just attractive because the
British have the accent they're just
cool people because they're British and
so you don't really have to be that cool
just because you're British makes you
cool and I feel like when I'm watching
British youtubers there is no getting
out of it once you start watching them
you're sucked in not gonna get out
you're gonna be suck and you're gonna be
watching British youtubers till you're
50 and I mean when you're watching
British youtubers you can't just watch
one video you'll just go oh click on the
suggested videos mmm instead of being on
YouTube for 10 minutes you were on for
two hours because you're clicking on
every single British youtuber there ever
is time to watch some YouTube videos oh
my gosh I can be just uploaded I love
you so much scroll oh hey look south
africa oh my gosh i love zoella she's
perfect i love you yeah Oh Alfie hello
three o'clock five o'clock seven o'clock
twelve o'clock oh my gosh what is
happening to me my personal favorites
include Jack and Finn so well uh Dan is
on fire Alfie and there's many more but
those are my top four I have to say but
i just want to ask y'all why are we so
obsessed with them why are they so
amazing to us because i can't figure out
so if you have a theory on why British
youtubers are so amazing make sure to
leave you down below because I really
want to figure this out chala you can
talk to burzum I personally believe that
British youtubers are almost some kind
of spell you know it kind of like you
get sucked into this black hole
vortexing you just can't stop and I
don't feel very dramatic about this but
I haven't obsessed in for the past few
weeks it's kind of been controlling me
like I don't watch any other videos
unless they're British and it's really
weird press Americans you know we're
just Americans in Israel of America law
being patriotic yeah USA woohoo but
nothing is that
interesting about us I mean there was
definitely like a British or youtuber /
down competition I mean without a doubt
you know who's gonna win British why are
they so addicting why is why are they
why are they the gods of YouTube because
i'd honestly can't figure it out so
that's the end of this video and i hope
you all enjoyed and don't take this too
seriously i'm just kind of addicted
lately I'll make sure to see you guys my
next video and yeah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
