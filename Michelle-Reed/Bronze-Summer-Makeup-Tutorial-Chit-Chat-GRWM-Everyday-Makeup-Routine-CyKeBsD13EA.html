today I am so excited because I'm doing
a chit chat get ready with me video I
haven't done one of these in such a long
time a lot of you guys requested this
look on one of my previous intros I was
wearing it and you guys really really
liked it and wanted to see this tutorial
so I'm just bringing you guys what you
want I'm trying out like this bandanna
thing and part of me kind of feels like
I'm about to go to sleepaway camp but I
also feel like I kind of like it so if
you stumbled across this video and you
don't know who I am and you don't they
subscribe my name is Michelle Reid and I
upload twice a week so I don't want this
video to be too too long so we're just
gonna go ahead and get started and I
really hope you guys enjoy so I'm
starting off by moisturizing this is the
Aveeno positively radiant moisturizer
what did I say that I'm sorry if the Sun
keeps coming like in and out in this
video it's really cloudy today also my
mom's vacuuming right now if you hear
some noise first and foremost let me
know how your guys's summer is going
right now is pretty boring honestly I'm
kind of just getting ready for college
next year and so there's it like a whole
lot to do and I've been working on video
stuff a lot and I thing with YouTube is
you're always just like sitting in your
room editing or filming or planning
something and so you can kind of be like
lonely all the time
it's just constantly like YouTube stuff
it also looks like I'm naked right now
but I promise I'm wearing the shirt or
foundation today I'm using the boots
number seven air brushed away foundation
this is the shade warm beige gonna be
honest I've never used this foundation
so I can't say like oh I really
recommend this or anything because I
haven't used it but I will let you guys
know it's one of these like eyedropper
ones which I don't know how I feel using
this beauty blender because of course I
also wanted to say if you're into more
like day of my life videos and more just
in my life definitely go subscribe to my
blog channel it's the shell out of our
show and since it's the summertime I've
been posting a lot on there and so I
definitely recommend checking that
channel now I promise this will be the
last promo but you should apply follow
me on instruments weather as well I'm
trying to be more social and talk to you
guys more on the
so if you're interested in that
definitely go follow me it's at Michelle
read and at Michelle read whitey needs
to be pretty light coverage and it also
just feels really light on your skin
which personally I like because I don't
need a ton of coverage also say that
this probably isn't the best foundation
for oily skin cuz it's definitely not a
matte finish a lot of you guys have been
asking about my brows lately so I'm
gonna really quick to show you guys how
I do it I use this NYX eyebrow pencil
which actually isn't the best shade for
me but I only outline my brows in this
so I just kind of like draw this shape
not so those precise and then this
product is my Holy Grail this is
benefits gimme brow I love this I have
the lightest color and I basically just
brush into my brows just makes your
brows so much fuller as you can see and
I love it and that is all I do to my
brow so I'm gonna go in and clean it up
in a second but for now that is what I
do so I'm going to move on to it the
eyeshadow that I'm doing I don't really
use an eye primer because I don't notice
a huge difference i memorize it so i
just use some concealer to kind of
neutralize my eyes because i do have a
little bit of darker lids i also wanted
to ask if you guys have any
recommendations for videos I'm always up
for like new requests on YouTube and
like new video ideas so if you have any
just leave them down below I'm gonna see
the shallows Saturday but I wanted to
ask by the time this video goes up it'll
be out like what you thought about it
because I don't really know I love Blake
Lively but I don't know if I could watch
like a whole movie of just her I feel
like it's gonna be interesting I don't
know her eyes I'm using my Naked 3
palette it's just a really pretty like a
rose gold and I'm gonna take the shade
limits and I'm gonna apply this to my
crease I pretty much do the same I look
all the time but I change up like my
face makeup in my lips
taking the shade nooner and i'm going to
apply this in kind of like the outer
crease just to deepen up the crease with
my blending brush find that whenever you
look down while doing your eyeshadow
it's so much easier and it comes out a
lot better so I always like to have look
down a little bit so I'm sorry if this
background is getting a little bit old I
know I film here like all the time but I
just really like the lighting in here
it's super bright and it looks good it's
my sister's room you're wondering they
are liar and Factory I'm going to apply
those in the outer corner then I'm going
in with the shade stranger and I'm going
to apply this all over my lid also going
to take that shade underneath my brow
and just highlight under now I'm
applying my tattoo liner from Kat Von D
I recently just started using this and I
really liked it I never wanted to be the
kind of person to use high-end eyeliner
just because it's something that you
have to buy all the time and so like I
don't have to buy high-end eyeliner all
the time but this one's really good and
it stays black all day so now it is time
to bake my concealer so I am using my
innocent aja ride dark circle concealer
I love this stuff I've tried other
concealers and I honestly just don't
like anything as much as this it's so
cheap so you just can't meet the price
so I'm just going to do a little
triangle underneath my eye then I go on
my chin and I also go around my brows
because I like to clean up any of the
brow gel I got there also I wanted to
talk about something else I'm trying to
do an Instagram theme guys I never
thought I would be the kind of person to
have an Instagram theme but for some
reason hello Katie XO her video just
like really inspired me I decided to try
it out so if you want to go stop by my
Instagram you can go see what it looks
like I only have like four pictures on
there
right now also I'm getting myself a good
month I don't think I'll make it any
longer than that but and I'm going to
bake this so I'm using my botanics the
power of plants lighter-than-air mineral
loose powder guys this stuff rocks I've
never heard anyone on YouTube talk about
this but it's so good it's a little
pricey but it just feels so light on
your skin and I love it so I just take
it in my beauty blender and I apply it
underneath my eyes you don't know what
baking is it basically just sets your
concealer you leave it on for five ish
minutes and then you take it off and
your concealer doesn't crease and it
looks good all night baking is the dream
so I really like to bake it up here I
kind of just place it there to make sure
everything stays and then I just kind of
leave this on for like five ish minutes
sometimes ten if I'm really feeling it
and I have time but I don't think I did
today so five minutes later I'll check
back in with you guys so try it out five
minutes and so I'm just going to brush
if you've been on my channel for a while
you know I only use the rocket mascara I
just love it it works really well I'm
just gonna curl my eyelashes and apply
that and that would be my dog it's
really hard to talk is you mascara at
the same time so I'm sorry if I'm not
talking that much bronzer i'm using my
hoola bronzer i love this bronzer it is
so so nice I'm a better person where I
feel like I don't feature a ton of like
new makeup products on my channel just
because I think if the product still
works
and you like it like what you have to go
out and buy a ton of makeup products I
guess this is why I'm not like a makeup
guru but kind of in this phase of my
life where I don't like having a ton of
things it's like I don't just like
having a ton of makeup products and a
ton of clothes just kind of no rush I'm
excited to talk about this this is the
Clinique
roly-poly rosy cream blush chubby stick
you're the kind of person that really
likes rosy cheeks this blush is really
good because it's like pretty opaque and
dot it
my Chi I definitely really really
blended out don't worry like I know it
looks scary at first but I honestly
would be so down for clinic sponsoring
one of my videos because I love their
products it's just like I have used
their products since I was really really
young and so I still like to set cream
blush just so it stays on longer and so
I'm taking my NARS blush in the shade
dolce vita don't save me that runs very
very lightly just brushing this over top
of the blush I know highlighters are
like all the rage right now but I'm just
using my knack one it's soft it gentle
it's a really really pretty shade I
don't like go crazy with Tyler here I
don't know why there's such an obsession
I feel like it can look really really
glittery really really fast and so now I
feel like this is kind of like the
secret to getting that bronze glow it's
only to use some kind of bronzing
product this is the Vita Liberata like
face powder like to take this on a
kabuki brush and tars I just blend it
down my neck and so you don't get any of
that like oh wow your face is a whole
lot Tanner than your neck and then I
just applying it to my face
so just lightly kind of going over I
know stirlitz I'm using my Kate Moss by
rebel ripple I'm a lipstick in the shade
14 I'm just applying that and then over
top of that I'm using my NYX lingerie
liquid lipstick in the shade of a 8 it's
a really pretty nude as well just
applying that over top and kind of
cleaning up with and there you have it
the very pretty bronze to look really
like this makeup look I think it is
great for the summertime it's super just
like glowy and fresh tan and definitely
recommend trying it out if you enjoyed
watching this video you should
definitely go watch my last video it was
things to do when you're born in the
summertime and I really enjoyed making
that video and I think a lot of us get
bored in the summertime so you should
definitely check that out
follow me on Instagram and Twitter and
I'll see you guys in my next video bye
