don't have makeup on I should probably
do this ensure whatever I make up hi
guys I'm so excited for this video
because it is going to be a chitchat get
ready with me video and I'm actually
going to be answering some questions on
advice that you guys need in this video
so it's gonna be a little bit of an
advice segment so if you want to be and
my next one I definitely follow me on
Instagram it's at Michelle Reed because
that's where I asked for questions for
this video and also if you're new like
always definitely subscribe the buttons
right here I upload twice a week and I
would love to see your face watching my
videos I can't really do that but if I
could I'd like it so yeah if you want to
see how to get this super glowy and
fresh and warm and pretty look
definitely continue watching and yeah so
I'm starting off with moisturizing I'm
using my Aveeno positively radiant waist
razor I love this stuff or foundation
today I'm going to be using my number 7
Boots foundation I love this stuff I
can't remember I think I use up in my
last video but if someone asked for some
college application advice and so I
guess I'll probably give like the number
one thing I'd have to say with college
applications I feel like a lot of people
focus on like extracurriculars and stuff
but I really do think that your essays
matters so whenever you're trying to
enter a school usually have to read the
essay and so really focus on that and
make that really different because
honestly a lot of people are gonna have
the same extracurriculars as you and the
same grades as you but what sets you
apart is definitely that essay now that
that's all blended in for the most part
I'm gonna do my brows I'm just keeping
it simple I'm using my gimme brow from
benefit I really like this stuff someone
asked for some freshman advice and I
actually liked a whole entire video on
that I also have a lot of videos on just
highschool advice in general and so if
you'd like to see that I'll have those
linked down below but probably my number
one tip would be just to have fun and
not take it too seriously my freshman
year of high school was definitely my
absolute favorite the whole year in
itself I was like just so innocent I
didn't care about a lot of stuff and I
feel like that's like when you have the
most fun not saying like going
I'm like partying and stuff I definitely
did not do that as a freshman or as a
senior but also focus on your grades at
the same time because I really tried
hard my freshman year it really really
helped my GPA so do that too so now that
my brows are done I'm gonna move on to
my eyes and so first I'm just going to
kind of conceal them with some concealer
I'm gonna ask what to do when like all
of your friends have designer items and
you're on a budget girl I feel you I
honestly I only shove it like this sale
section at stores I don't even read that
last time I bought something that wasn't
on sale I don't buy designer things
hardly ever like I feel you I'm so into
saving money right now I think it's all
how you put it together you can buy
something that's ten dollars but if you
put it together well it'll look like
it's a thousand dollars it's like
honestly and using my shade and light
palette I'm gonna take this really
really nice peach color right here I'm
gonna put this in my crease as a
transition shade so someone asked about
not clicking with guys and how to
necessarily like find someone that you
click with my name is I haven't dated in
like three years because I've been with
Gunnar for the past three years
I think it's just it happens and you
can't try to force it like do you ever
feel like you're just not clicking with
someone then leave you just have to wait
till the right person comes along I know
it's so cliche to say that and hear that
especially the right person will come
along if you just give it time you don't
try to like force anything then I'm just
taking the more like red shade right
here I'm gonna apply this over top of
that crease color just to define it
and now I'm actually going into this
blush Alex these colors are beautiful
and I'm going to use them as the
eyeshadow i'm gonna use this color right
here i believe it's just a really pretty
kind of peachy orange color and I'm just
gonna apply that to my lid since a color
did kind of overpower like the red
calories I'm gonna go back in and just
focus that in the outer crease I'm gonna
as a highlight I'm just gonna use this
shade right here
so now I'm gonna go in with my concealer
and I'm gonna put this under my eyes and
kind of clean up all this excess
eyeshadow someone asked about not
overthinking your relationship because
she does that a lot
and I made her last relationship go
downhill and I can totally say that I
feel you on this one I am such an
over-thinker in every aspect of my life
like whether it be school or my personal
life or YouTube it's like I just I
overthink everything and it ruins it
like it really does all I'll say is you
just have to let go if something happens
and you overthink it and you do well on
it it's gonna affect you in such a
negative way and you're not gonna have
nearly as much fun if you do that so now
that my under eyes are nice and
highlighted I'm going to set it with my
same app powders yeah I just find that
whenever I let go of things I just have
such a more enjoyable time and I'm so
much more happy I think comparison is
also a big thing
often times we compare our relationships
to those that we see on social media
more like I'm not having that much fun
my relationship isn't as great when in
reality you're just comparing yourself
with something on social media which is
such a bad representation of what real
life is it just live your relationship
for you and not other people and I trust
me like you'll have so much of a better
time and then I'm going to set my actual
foundation with my botanics powder
because I really really like this and
since I'm going for a glowy look I'm
really going to use this with a light
hand and not really pack it on so now
I'm going to go back in under my eyes
and take this peak
shade I'm gonna apply this on my lower
lash line and then in my inner corner
I'm just really packing on that peach
color that I used on my lid and then I'm
just taking the red shade and I'm
applying this to my outer corner or my
outer lash line and then I'm just
applying a thin line of my Kat Von D
eyeliner some reason I end up doing like
a really bad cat eye so I apologize but
now I'm just gonna curl my lashes and
apply my rocket mascara so someone asks
on tips about dealing with anxiety then
I feel you on this I'm not like
diagnosed with things I hear anything
but I definitely feel anxious a lot and
one thing I like to do whatever I feel
myself getting really anxious and stress
is I just really really breathe a lot
and I try to deep breathe and tell
myself that it's gonna be okay because
it always is that's the thing make
things so much worse in our minds and
they actually are and so just repeatedly
tell yourself that and tell yourself
that you're gonna get everything done
and then it's gonna work out so now I'm
moving on to face makeup and I'm gonna
be using my color bronzer as you guys
know I love this some of us on
overthinking and how not to overthink at
night and I have been doing this so much
lately it's just because it's like going
to college and so many changes like
happening soon once it hits like 12
o'clock
everything just hits me and so honestly
my best advice would be just to go to
bed that's what I do cuz I always wake
up and things are so much better in the
morning and I'm like why did I sit and
cry on my bed about this because it was
so stupid shut off like your electronics
and just go to bed honestly because
probably not worth staying up and
overthinking and it's always better in
the morning for blush I'm using my
clinic chubby stick because I love this
stuff it's so creamy someone asked about
affording college and just like getting
scholarships and honestly just like
saving money I can really really feel
you on this because I've been saving up
money for the past like four years and
it's honestly just about cutting costs
where you can so like I said whenever I
shop I basically only shop in sales
section I barely eat out I don't eat out
very often I only go to Starbucks
I have gift cards it's all about
prioritizing and I feel like if you
really like want to go out of state you
can make it happen notice that that I'm
using my Clinique blush and sunset glow
as far as scholarships goes there's so
many websites that you can apply for
scholarships I think inside an hour of
each day to apply for scholarships cuz
there's so many online and just working
hard in school so you can get
scholarships actually from your school
as well and then for highlight I'm using
Mac's
soft and gentle because I've been loving
super it just highlighted and glowy skin
and it's so pretty and that for lets I'm
using two products I'm using my rebel
and ultra matte lip color in the Clair
seduction and then this wet and wild lip
gloss in the shade raised on good corals
that's it for my chit chat get ready
with me video this is the look that I
did just very soft and warm and I really
hope you guys enjoyed this if I answered
your question definitely let me know you

follow me on Instagram and Twitter so I
have been very active on there and I
