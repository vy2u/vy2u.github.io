channel you should totally subscribe the
buttons down below as you guys know I'm
going to be a sophomore in college next
year and so it didn't video I'm going to
be showing you guys the things that I
picked up for my dorm room before next
year actually live in a studio apartment
in New York cities it's not exactly a
dorm room but basically it's the size of
the dorm rooms I figured over just title
the video in the same way I'm you guys
don't last year I have a really pretty
gallery wall above my bed because I love
art I love quotes I really get inspired
by those things and so I got to be
really cool to collab with society6 and
this video ID six basically has a ton a
ton a ton of unique art pieces that are
made for you guys so they're things like
best fries pillows shower curtains
notebooks laptop cases honestly anything
you can think of all the money goes to
the artists themselves so it's a really
cool way to support people and find some
really awesome pieces I also have a
really awesome coupon code for you guys
you should definitely check it out right
here it gets you 10% off and free
shipping worldwide so let's go ahead and
get right into it so as far as my dorm
room theme goes I'm not really sure
exactly what I'm doing yet but I really
like flowers I really like plants I
really like things that are really
colorful I also like the color pink a
lot so that's what kind of my fame is I
kind of just got things that I'll match
first I have this pillow which I thought
it was really pretty it has a little
succulent at the bottom I love because
it's not like right on the front it's
like at the bottom so it's a little bit
more subtle I really like throw pillows
because they add a ton of color in just
pretty details and I spent a lot of time
chilling in my bed editing videos so
having a ton of pillows is really nice I
have a collection of all the things that
I purchased down below so you guys can
easily check that out well I also have
this tote bag because I do a ton of
grocery shopping in New York City and
you have to carry all your stuff back to
your apartment so I don't put so much
cute it's a really pretty mint green
color and it all times these little like
leaves
Daisy things on that I just thought was
a good size to put some something in or
if I want to go edit or study at a
coffee shop this will fit my laptop
perfectly the next thing is my favorite
thing that I got I love it so much it is
a really pretty canvas art and it has
little flowers all over it
just like your basic flowers nothing
like too crazy but their watercolor and
also canvas which I just think is so so
nice it's gonna be so pretty on my walls
all my other pieces I think you see this
piece is larger so normally I need to be
really really expensive to ship but
since I have a coupon code it really
helps you guys out with shipping said
nothing recommend using it else about
this little piece of art especially a
quote I don't really use reading so
lighting sprite but it says list simply
expects little give much those your life
with love
scattered sunshine forget self think of
others and do it you would be done by I
think things like this are really
inspiring just whenever you're feeling
down or you need a little bit of
encouragement having this on the wall
it's nice also a square size and I think
whenever you have a gallery wall it's
cool like mix things up and have a ton
of different sizes so I thought this one
will be really nice the next piece of
art I have is in this thing from a
fold-out I really really like the brave
stay lobby but I got this print which is
go say Lobby and like a script text
writing it's also a really pretty like
blush pink color it's also a really good
size and so I think I'm just going to
cut this and put this up without a frame
I might get it framed I'm not really
sure and I think eyes know I love pink
and I thought that it matched really
well with the campus I also have abroad
for my apartment because last year I
totally just like never got a rug I
always said I was going to get one I
never did I thought this one is so
pretty look how freakin vibrant this is
guys I just thought it was adorable it
has flowers like all over it I know like
this would be overkill for some people
but I just think it's so pretty and
bright I'm going to put this in the
bathroom or maybe like under my desk I
think we might be cute none of its
really cute laptop case because I'm
always going places taking my laptop
with me but it's a really pretty blue
patterning I love this shade of blue I
think it's very beautiful this my laptop
perfectly and I'm also going to keep it
protected which is nice because I'm
always flinging my backpack around
throwing this thing around and I've
never really had like an actual case so
this is going to be nice this next thing
is kind of boring but it is a necessity
and that is tells and I actually a whole
towel set because having multiple house
is so nice and college guys you don't
have to watch yourself like everything
if I got this print it's really simple
it's just gray and has like little gold
flecks in it and a more abstract but
that is the pattern I was sort of simple
and these are really really soft like I
cannot wait to actually use these just
kind of like hand towel another hand
towel an actual towel which are not
going to fold because it's huge and then
another actual towel but I think that
set is really nice I also picked up a
notebook because you can never have
enough notebooks in college and so this
one just has kind of an abstract little
print on it about the colors are really
pretty and this is just going to be guys
for like throwing down like thought
might users identity to journal actually
because I always need one of those an
interaction cycle
another class thing is a shower curtain
now I don't know what my roommate is
going to want to do so I picked this up
and if she doesn't like it then we don't
have to use it but it's basically just
in orange color it's kind of a pretty
like different color if you like awesome
I throw all the same colors together and
sometimes I want something different I
thought this orange might be a little
bit pretty for a shower curtain diffuse
it like this and we don't have to use it
but I thought it's nice thumbs up for
this haul video let me know where you
guys are going to school and if you
started decorating your dorm what theme
