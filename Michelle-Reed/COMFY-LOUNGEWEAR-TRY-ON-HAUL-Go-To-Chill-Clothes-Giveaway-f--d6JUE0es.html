Michelle out of your shell I've saw a
friend in this video because I am back
home in Texas for the week and I'm so so
so excited to be back home so today's
video I wanted to do another haul video
but I wanted to do this whole with some
really cute comfy clothes that I kind of
like to wear in college whenever I'm
lounging and just hanging out I have a
business casual dress code in college
and so I don't really get to wear like
comfy clothes to class and so whenever I
get home I always like to have like if
you go to pieces that I like to wear but
that'd be really good to do this whole
video dope it's also hooking me up in
this video if you don't know what dope
is it's only a shopping app you probably
heard everyone and their mom talking
about it out of you guys we're kind of
getting annoyed that they kept talking
about them but they offered to do a
giveaway in this video and anything
that's gonna benefit you guys I'm gonna
do because I want to help you guys out

sponsoring it this is literally just for
you guys basically how it works is if
you follow me on the dope about Michelle

Instagram app name and also what piece
you like and in 24 hours from when this
video is posted joy means if you're
watching this right when it's posted you
better get on this I'm gonna pick ten
winners to get one piece for the video
that I mentioned so you should
definitely enter it's really easy there
are a ton of pieces in this video the
first thing that I have is a really cute
little sports bra from Erie and I love
this cuz it's almost kind of glittery if
you can tell and I like this because
it's almost long enough where if you
wore this with high waisted leggings you
could so wear this has a top I actually
don't like to wear sports bras as top so
I would prefer to wear a top but I think
some of you would really like that I
think the color is super unique this was
really cheap too I think this is like 15
bucks I really like it I think it's cute
for working out or just lounging around
at home really like this also from area
I got this top which I wore recently a
couple days ago in a blog but it's like
this sheer turtleneck and it's really
cute and cropped and obviously this is
really sheer so I wouldn't just away
it like as a shirt but I really like
wearing this with something underneath I
wore it with like a black body sue and I
think this is so cute
it almost reminds me of like whatever I
used to do ballet and you would like
throw something over your leotard it
looks super cute it's kind of like
ballerina off duty to think it's cute
for like lounging around and the color
is also really pretty this next thing is
also from airy and I'm wearing this so
much I've been seeing a lot of girls
wear these really cute sweaters with
like huge balloons these and so it's
still pretty cold in New York it's like
in the 40s all this week I got this
sweater and it's like it's hand color
and it's a little bit cropped but not
super cropped and it has these awesome
balloon sleeves I literally love them I
think that they are so cute and it's
just like a really comfy like knit
classic sweater it's not scratchy a lot
of times you order stuff like this and
it's so scratchy so I'm so thankful that
I can just throw this on and even like
over a bodysuit this would be really
cute with some black jeans seal booties
the next thing is a classic lounge thing
I also have this from Erie something
area is really cute lounge wear a
jumpsuit and it's basically just long
but it's a tank top which I like because
my apartment can get a little bit warm
Emily neat this is more like a pajama
piece but I actually wore this out
because I think that it's really cute
though it's SuperDuper soft super cute
really really like this stuff from Erie
I got this body suit which I thought
would be really cute for your psyche
lounging around but it's this really
pretty floral pattern feel like
everything that's all is like purple but
I just really like this color and I
think it's cute cause it's like a halter
neckline so you basically just like tie
it like these the whole back is open
which we didn't really realize and I'm
not really like a huge open back kind of
bruisings I don't know what kind of
briars
to where and I don't have a huge huge
chest but I still have a little
something so I can't go braless and so I
honestly think if you are like pretty
flat-chested this would be really cute
to work so you clearly wouldn't have to
wear a bra on it's still like this thing
is cute gonna tuck it into some jeans
these next two things are just little
nightgowns because I recently discovered
that sleeping in nightgowns is a lot
comfier than stuffy with pants it's true
it's why I love this color it's like a
blue cotton e material I've got this
from Airy and it has little ruffles on
it and then the back is like fully
exposed if you can tell I don't they
want to try these on so enter the
picture of the models wearing them also
got this little nightgown as well this
one is just like a really pretty cream
color it's nice and sheer and I love
stuff like this I think it's fun going
to sleep it's things that you feel like
cute in in the last piece I got I'm
obsessed with this is from Urban
Outfitters and I literally love this
it's this huge cardigan and this color
is beautiful I really like it looks like
this new hair color too I think it's
really pretty it is just so cozy and I
love throwing this on over dresses with
tights I just think it looks so cute
like I said it's still really cold in
the city and so I haven't still wear
stuff like this and be like perfectly
fine so that is everything that I got
