video because it is a makeup tutorial
what Michelle does makeup steals
yeah I found this picture of Cara
Delevingne I think on like tumblr or
something I just thought her makeup was
so pretty and I also thought it'd be a
great Valentine's Day makeup tutorial so
I decided to combine the two and make
this video couple things I want to say
why I'm not a makeup artist I don't
really normally do makeup videos but I
am really into makeup and I think it's
fun I don't do all the perfect
techniques I'm just a teenage girl who
likes doing my makeup also I know I
don't look exactly like Cara Delevingne
obviously she is beautiful and gorgeous
and her bone structure is phenomenal but
this look is just more like an inspired
look and not necessarily identical if
you're new to my channel you should
definitely subscribe right now the movie
right here and also down below I upload
Sundays and Thursdays and I do lifestyle
beauty and fashion videos so I would
love for you to subscribe right now and
let's just go ahead and roll the
tutorial so the most important part I
think is to prime your skin and so I'm
using some moisturizer first this is one
from simple and then also my Smashbox
photo finish primer and like to set my
makeup and get ready for foundation to
prime my eyes I'm using my NYX jumbo eye
shadow pencil and milk it makes the
colors pop really really well I know
it's not that sophisticated but it looks
great
so I just blend that in and then all
over my lid I am using the shade strange
or just from my Naked 3 palette kara
didn't really have anything too intense
eye shadow wise so I just did kind of a
neutral eye look
I am then applying the shade naked from
the original naked eyeshadow palette all
over my crease and then to kind of
define the crease I am applying buck to
more of the outer crease just to make
everything look sharp and well put
together next I'm going back in with the
color strange and I'm just applying this
under my brow bone as my highlight and
then I'm going in with the Anastasia
brow Wiz pencil and I'm just filling in
my brows caracaras eye brows are
definitely not like mine at all and I
can't get mine waxed so I'm doing the
best that I can but she has pretty bushy
eyebrows and then I'm going in with my
naked skin foundation I love this stuff
it looks so natural but it looks so
glowy and Kara's makeup is definitely
very glowy in this I'm going in with a
fit me concealer and I'm applying this
in an upside-down triangle motion
underneath my eyes and kind of swooping
it up to clean up any of the eye shadow
this really brightens up my face it's
probably the most important part will
the second most important and then
drawing little V's underneath my eyes
with my L'Oreal magic Lumi highlighter
and I'm setting everything with my
Rimmel stay matte powder I'm going back
in with the shade buck and I'm applying
this to my outer lower lash line to
define things and then I highlight my
inner corner I'm using the shade nude
from my lorac Pro palette this really
brightens up the look and then I'm
applying my Ardell natural lashes and
I'm doing a very thick winged eyeliner
not the best at waiting the eyeliner but
this is pretty good for me I would say
I'm just setting everything with a black
eye shadow I'm also going in underneath
my lower lash line implying this tight
lighting my eyes and applying rocket
mascara I'm using my hoola bronzer to
contour my cheekbones and my forehead
until it looks nice and slim then I'm
using a Clinique cream blush in the
shade robust rhubarb because Cara looked
like she had some pretty peachy
cheekbones and then I'm also setting
that with peacefull from Tarte and I'm
contouring my nose just a little bit not
too much I'm not super good at doing
this but I think it turned out pretty
nice and I'm highlighting with hiding
from benefit to give my skin more of a
glowy look for lips I'm using my Revlon
Ultra HD matte lip color it doesn't have
a shade but it's basically the brightest
hot pink color I love this it looked so
good and I was really feeling it so and
then I'm finishing off with my smash
primer water and then I said for the
makeup tutorial so I really hope you

so much fun recreating the look and just
