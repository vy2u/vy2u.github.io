chit chat get ready with me video I feel
like lately I've had a lot of stuff
going on in my life and just like update
I figured I would kill two birds with
one stone and film this video and do my
makeup at the same time definitely let
me know if you guys enjoy this video I
will definitely do more of them if you
guys like then do this be a like let me
know in the comments I'd really
appreciate it if you are new to my
channel definitely subscribe I upload on
Sunday sin Thursday's I'd love to have
you here on my channel so with all that
being said I think I had talked a lot in
this video so we're just gonna go ahead
and get it so to get ready with me so to
start off I already moisturize my face
and I use my simple moisturizer love
this if you're someone with sensitive
skin this is really great it's just very
mild then going in with fiber lately
I've been obsessed with priming my skin
this is the Smashbox photo finish primer
in the light one I really like this one
because just that original one is just a
little too heavy for my skin cuz my skin
is not super sensitive but it is a bit
sensitive but y'all I'm so pale - guys
I'm would really like the same shade as
a shirt I'm wearing what a sad day so
for foundation I'm using my naked skin
foundation this foundation rock so I
feel like I haven't talked to you guys
and so long I just want to talk about
some things about like what craziness
husband my life lately so basically the
next week I get to go to New York I'm
trying out for a scholarship competition
thing at one of the schools that I hope
to go to and so I'm so excited guys I
have been to New York in such a long
time it hopes to get like some really
good video shots while I'm there - I
want to do kind of like a travel diary
type thing but not swear it's like super
fancy and edited because I don't even
know how to make that kind of stuff but
just something like really raw and fun
to watch which is kind of how I feel
like I want my videos to go kind of
everyone has made that transition in the
past like few months of just wanting to
make content that is more genuine and
that you actually enjoy watching I'm
just like done making these like cheesy
like almost like fast food videos where
you don't really get anything out of it
they're just non nourishing not fun to
watch I mean they're fun to watch but
you don't do anything
like not me at all and so I think that's
pretty much good for makeup I'm not
taking my fitna concealer which is
almost gone I have to like shove it in
here to try to get somehow
yeah the scholarship that I'm working on
this taking up all of my time it's been
exhausting it's a lot of work and so I
just haven't been able to put how much
time into YouTube but at the same time I
think you kind of change your priorities
sometimes and sometimes things just have
to go on the back burner and that was
YouTube for a while so that's kind of
why I've been a little bit m.i.a lately
after spring break or actually Spring
Break I'm staying home I'm gonna film a
lot and just make really awesome videos
for you guys so now that is all blended
out I like to do another concealer just
to like very dark under eyes this is the
instant age rewind brightener so it's
not really concealer I just feel weird
using it alone but I just put that
underneath my eyes I don't do a triangle
or anything because that would be a lot
next I am just using my Rimmel stay
matte powder and my powder brush is not
here so I'm using a blush on so this is
on point fun I really like how dewy skin
looks I just think it's so fresh and
natural and I've been kind of taking
more like a fresh approach to my makeup
rather than anything too intense so now
we're moving on to eyebrows I'm using my
Anastasia brow Wiz I'm not like a huge
brow person guys I'm just gonna be
honest don't really do that much I don't
like draw any lines I just fill in where
my natural brow like arches I really
need to tweeze my eyebrows so I'm using
my Kula bronzer I think this is the only
bronzer I've like legitimately ever used
it just works really well I have been
using these Saint Tropez self-tanner
lately
just because I'm a competition season
and it looks better if you're not like
super HD and you're wearing a costume
and I'm so pasty so what I was really
intense I'm noticing that it's very hard
to talk while doing makeup it kind of
slightly apply it to my forehead not
really thinking that much I feel like
that's my whole makeup / - you just
don't really think about it just go for
it or blush today I'm going with my
staple this is gnar
Dolce Vita the dulce Vita love this
flush guys it stays on all day it's a
really pretty muggy like dark blush it's
just so pretty and so I'm just applying
this to the apples so that's it for the
face I don't do any highlighter or
anything because I usually don't have
time to do any highlighter just gonna
prime my eyes with concealer because
honestly like my primer does nothing to
my eyes just blending that out with my
finger I'm just gonna set that concealer
with my pressed powder so it doesn't
crease because that does happen guys I'm
also gonna take my NYX what is this
jumbo eyeshadow pencil of milk do you
guys remember like back in old school
YouTube this was like the thing to have
I just dropped it but I'm applying this
underneath my brows and then to my inner
tear duct and then also on my eyelid
because I really want the look that I'm
doing to be super bright there's my dad
hello dad really what the eye look that
I'm doing to be super bright and just
like healthy and youthful and so you
gotta make sure to highlight those areas
going in with my lorac Pro palette and
I'm going to take the shade white and
cream and I'm gonna mix those just cuz
if I cream doesn't show up on my eyes
very well I take the shade mom I think
it's like this kind of brownie purple
color just working that into my crease
really trying to define I'm vlogging
today so I wanted to say to you guys to
go check out my blog channel it's
Michelle out of her shell I love it
vlogging is so much fun guys I enjoy it
so much i vlog like maybe like once a
week which is lame right now I know but
I'll get better in time I promise I'm
not gonna take the shade pewter which is
kind of like this purpley brown shade I
have to use this palette and so long
it's weird but I'm just going to apply
this to the outer corner of my eye
so then I'm going in with the shade of
white again and I'm gonna highlight
underneath my brows and then in my inner
corner and I'm really gonna make this
like a stark highlight my inner corner
so now we're going on to mascara I
haven't been wearing eyeliner for the
past week and I just really like how it
looks
using my rocket mascara go big or go
home I'd use a saw scare for the past
year I think many of you guys have been
asking me where I want to go to college
good question I'm still in the process
of figuring that out and I also don't
know if I'm going to like say or not I
just haven't sorted out everything and
so I don't want to act too quickly and
tell you guys something and I'm like oh
wait don't regret that so okay it is so
hard to put on mascara and talk I will
be right back so now for lips I'm using
it be using the Rimmel lipstick in the
shade oh wait this is the Kate Moss
collection these lipsticks are so good
this is just a really pretty Bobby pink
color that's usually what I stick to
yeah for the college thing I miss taupe
know exactly where I'm going yet I
applied to one school and I got into
their business school which is a really
really good school so that was such a
good thing it's a now I'm torn between
New York and that school and I haven't
really figured everything out yet so
once everything is finished I go in with
my Smashbox photo finish primer I just
bought a new one it said all my makeup
with this give dry skin I'd so recommend
this it just kind of moisturizes your
skin after all the makeup at the end of
the process see you guys that's it for
the makeup I really hope you guys
enjoyed getting ready with me today I
had a blast and I can't wait to do more
