Works I picked up some candles and I
really want to show you guys what I got
they're all Christmas once too so that's
a plus and I also have some SC polishes
that I recently got that I want to show
you guys I'm also unlike a super good
mood because we just got off for
thanksgiving break so the first thing i
got is something that goes um put
candles inside up and it looks like this
has little snowflakes on it and then the
bottoms of snowflake it's just really
cute and this was 550 you just put them
in like this then I got four of like the
medium sized candles so the first time I
God is winter candy apple it looks like
that it's like this um I didn't do like
the whole 24 10 cuz it wasn't going on
and I didn't feel like waiting so I just
went ahead and bought them and this one
smells it smells like candy apples like
I don't really know what else you can
say then I got winter which is such a
creative name and it has notes of pine
needles for a balsam in winter woods
yeah I just kind of smells like all
those winter candles it's not original
but I really like this smell like pine
trees and stuff and then I got vanilla
bean noel which smells they're very very
light sand but it just smells like
vanilla last one I got is twisted
peppermint this is definitely my
favorite I'm living the cover it's
actually not very cute but has a snowman
on it this domain arm so it was kind of
creepy I can't lie
I'm obsessed with peppermint I'm such a
fan I like this germ x on my backpack
and I use it like two times every 10
minutes and it smells so good I'm SI not
digging the color though White's blue I
kind of wish it was like white or red
but you know whatever it smells good so
that is all I got from Bath and Body
Works so now i'm going to show you guys
the SE polishes that i recently got
coles recently started to sell them so i
bought four of them and so the first one
is the one I have on right now minus my
ring finger and this is Fiji it's just a
pale pink it's my favorite pale pink
because you only need two coats and it's
just super opaque and pretty and I love
it next I have eternal optimist and this
is actually one of my sister got but
she's in college so she's just gonna
paint an Ellen when she comes home but
it looks like this it's like a moth kind
of dusty rose pink that's when I got is
a lapis of luck way to say that lap is
of luxury i'm probably saying that wrong
but it's kind of like a periwinkle
purplish blue it's really really pretty
just kidding that was not the last one I
also got the rock solid base coat I've
never honestly had like a true base coat
and I want to strengthen my nails
because as you can see they're really
really short so trying to get them all
long and pretty but I fight then so says
the end of this little haul i'm so
excited to thanksgiving break so i'll
have so many more videos up for you guys
like so many more videos so that was the
end of this video and i will see you
guys my next one ah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
