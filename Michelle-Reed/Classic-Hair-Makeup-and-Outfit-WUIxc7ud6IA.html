Hollywood this is a classic hair makeup
and outfits tutorial featuring red lips
soft curls and nude pumps enjoy starting
off I am pinning back my hair and taking
my nearly naked foundation and applying
this to my face to give our skin a
flawless look which was very popular
making sure to blend down my necks I
don't have any obvious foundation lines
now I'm taking my garni roller ball
underneath my eyes to get rid of any
puffs or darkness and I'm putting a
concealer over top and then I am just
setting all of this face makeup with my
Rimmel stay matte powder to give a matte
look now taking a soft pink blush I am
applying this to my cheekbones
now I'm taking some oil blotting sheets
and blotting my face since a matte face
is a very classic look for eyes I am
just going to be priming my eyes with my
Urban Decay primer potion and then
applying a soft nude eyeshadow over top
now I am taking a gel eyeliner and
creating a very thick wings line then
I'm just curling my eyelashes and
applying a Volume II mascara and then a
lengthening mascara
cleaning up any excess around with the
q-tip red lips are all the rage so I'm
applying a my Revlon a red lipstick and
then blotting off any excess and
applying a deeper berry lipstick to the
center and then I'm just filling in my
brows to frame my face and give more
definition for hair we are going to be
achieving some very soft curls so I'm
brushing out my hair and taking about a
one-inch section and just curling my
hair with my hot tools 1 inch wrapping
it around the barrel holding for 10
seconds and then I'm letting go into the
palm of my hand and then pinning the
curl to the top of my head this way
you're going to get more voluminous soft
curls instead of sperry structured curls
this is the same technique that is used
by heat rollers but is much much easier
and then I'm just here spraying the
curls at the top of my head
and you're done I'm just kidding um so
just I'm in all of your curls and now
you will have very bouncy very soft
luminous curls which I absolutely love
and then I'm just hair spraying these so
they last all day long and there you
have it soft voluminous curls
for my outfit I am wearing a navy lace
dress from our EECOM which sells custom
made dresses using your measurements so
they are the perfect fit every time this
dress is super classy and I paired it
with a white bubble necklace from Etsy I
absolutely love the deep v-neck that is
in the back of the dress I feel like it
is so pretty and then for shoes I'm just
keeping it simple with some nude pumps
from Target
you like the pointed toe it's just super
pretty versus a rounded toe so I am an
absolute love with this dress I feel
like the style is very timeless and so
to get your own dress like this one
check the links below I also have my own
coupon code as well so I hope you all
enjoyed this very classic look and try
it out for your own because I feel like
it's super pretty so yeah and always
remember to keep it classy bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
