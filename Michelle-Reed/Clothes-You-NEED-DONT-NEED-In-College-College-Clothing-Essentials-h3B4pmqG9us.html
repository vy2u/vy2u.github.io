realize it ain't gonna fit
I gotcha in this video I would be
telling you guys close that you should
and shouldn't bring to college I know a
lot of you guys are probably packing for
college and honestly whenever I moved to
New York I brought so many things that I
just like didn't need and I also forgot
to bring things that I really needed in
so in-phase video I may help you guys
pack for college obviously wherever you
go to school in the climate is going to
kind of change what you cut but this is
my experience personally pick it with a
grain of salt I think some sort of
phrases although at my school we have to
wear business casual so I don't have
like Nike Shores or like t-shirts or any
of that I couldn't worry about to school
obviously is that something that your
school allows and like bring that I'm
going to be a sophomore at the Kings
College and I make a lot of college
videos in beauty and fashion videos let
me know where you're going down below
and I also think I'm going to make these
videos or like things for your dorm what
you shouldn't shouldn't bring let me
know if you'd be into that down below
give this a thumbs up also let's just go
ahead and get right into learning off of
the things that I would say you need for
college the biggest thing that I feel
like a lot of people forget is their
rain jacket it rains everywhere at one
that is nice quality that house is going
to protect you
I left a ton of my clothes in New York I
don't have my actual rain jacket this is
one I have to show you for example ever
you wake up one morning and you realize
that it's raining and you don't have a
rain jacket it is the worst feeling ever
so make sure that you get one of these
basic comfortable shirts
this one from brandy melville it's just
gray but I just think any shirt that's
just like plain and simple that you can
throw on with jeans or leggings is
essential for thing about college is
making sure you have multiple pieces
that could go in like multiple different
outfits so like make sure when you're
packing you can wear something like five
different things before you bring it to
college oversized jean jacket I love
this one it's actually twisted so you
can actually get this one like in stores
or anything but these are so nice if you
want to throw it over like a jumpsuit or
like even leggings it's really really
nice to throw on really essential and
they can go with everything just saying
is probably the most important but that
would be comfortable sweatshirts to wear
in your dorm I can't even tell you how
many times I would come back from class
and just draw on a sweatshirt this one
is just high school one is just those
kings on it but it is so
come see don't limit yourself because I
would always wear these all I was doing
homework in the library or something and
they're just really considerable few
dresses that you can go out in so if you
have an event maybe like a sorority
event or you're going on a date or
something it's nice to have a nice dress
already in your closet so you'll have to
go out and find one this one is just
from the off Saks Fifth Avenue store
when I wore them to an event that I have
at school it's like a little party my
colors are throwing Regicides as those
slits on the side couple of nice
business shirts you never know if you're
gonna have to do a presentation for a
class or a job interview or anything so
I have this shirt that's just for made
while it's really wrinkled but it has
little ruffles on the bottom but having
these already on hand again just helps
you don't need a time just have like two
shirts wear pants that maybe like a
pencil skirt just in case you do have
something that you do have to wear
something more professional a lot of you
guys may laugh at this one but I'm
serious that would be a fuzzy robe so
many times I would get outside on my
bathroom just want to like cozy up in my
bro's and I go on my laptop for a little
bit I know it makes you stupid but like
I wore my robe so much I'd recommend
picking up one for shoes I have two
pairs of shoes the first one would be
just a nice pair of tennis shoes that
you can actually wear cute outfits to I
white converse eyewear with everything I
could totally put these with like 90
shorts or leggings but I could also
throw them all with some jeans and like
a cute top and they're just really
versatile I have literally have lipstick
on in this entire video I'd also working
about having one pair of shoes that is
cute but also comfortable this is a pair
of sandal that I got these are from
Steve Madden they're just a little suede
slip-on but I like these because they're
comfortable to walk around on cuz you
usually have to walk around campus but
they're all so freakin cute these are so
adorable
so now other the thing is that you don't
need to bring it it's kind of random but
don't bring a ton of like really tight
like skirts like so that are like body
con skirt and college you're usually
going to want to be comfortable and just
things like this aren't practical you're
probably going to bring them and think
you're going to wear them but that's
gonna be one of those nice that you like
it all Cheetos and your comp loaded you
just don't want to put on a skirt like
this so I mean you could bring a couple
but like don't stock up in your closet
with like tight clothes because you're
probably not going to wear up I also
what I recommend
a ton of cute sundresses they're also
just not very practical you have
day-to-day when you're going to class
most of you guys probably aren't going
to throw on like a sundress but this in
between dress that it's like not formal
enough but not super casual is just not
super practical for college the next
thing would be the pieces in your closet
that you've never really worn at home
but you're like I might wear this in
college you probably won't for instance
like this fur vest is something that I
probably wear like once every three
months I don't wear it that often and so
I left it at home and I never even
thought about it so if you're like going
through your clothes and you're like I'm
really attached to this but I never wear
it just don't bring it it's going to
save space next a ton of sandals aren't
necessary I think you should have like
maybe a black pair and a brown pair but
don't bring like every single sandal
that you have because on estate agents
aren't that comfortable and you're
probably going to be wearing tennis
shoes more often than not and sandals
just honestly are like kind of
inconvenient to wear whatever you're
walking around campus so I do think you
should forget a couple pairs but like
don't bring all of your sandals just
bring your staples I'm going along with
that don't bring all of the purses in
your closet so this is a purse that I
think is like one of my staple ones but
I have like three others that are just
like it so I would recommend kind of
leaving some of your purses at home
maybe have like a black blonde a brown
one and then a small purse to go out and
that's honestly all you need also don't
bring a ton of workout clothes I brought
a lot of like pink off and like these
little like jacket things and stuff and
like yes you're going to wear these to
class I think that's one thing but hey
you're probably not going to have a ton
of time to work out and be you just
don't need a lot of workout clothes okay
like it takes off the short sleeve shirt
one jog in like some leggings that's
honestly fine you can wash your workout
clothes you want me to breathe like
every single seat so those are all the
things that I would say are essentials
and that aren't essential don't forget
to let me know where you're going to
school I'm definitely interested also
let me know what things you think are
essentials and what things are essential
because I want it's all like help each
other out in this video so it would be
super nice you should also go watch my
last video and also subscribe to my blog
channel because I have been blogging a
ton I love you guys and I'll see you
guys in my next one bye friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
