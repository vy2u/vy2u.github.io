home for you guys this is a collective
haul though so the stuff has been
accumulated over like almost the past
month don't want to say so I just felt
like doing hall and show you guys some
things that I got recently except in
this hall i think i want to show you
guys separately like what the pieces
look like so you're not just seeing them
for yourself on camera you're actually
seeing what they look like on so i think
i have a few beauty items fashion
related stuff and shoes so if you this
is a good wolf variation we got going
here so i guess i'll start off with a
pair of shoes that i got actually got
these a while back I'm I ordered them
online I'm from ebay i believe or sapos
but they are studded loafer type shoes
and they look like this they're grey um
I thought they were like a beige color
like more like a sandy color but when I
got them they were great and I've
honestly never worn these because I
don't know how to wear them like feeling
something that like cerebella 93 X would
wear like the full time call me crazy
but I just really like these that I have
no idea how to wear them I'm there the
brand nine west if I did say that but
they look like this so if you can call
it how you would style these shoes that
would definitely help me out and be very
appreciative then I got a swimsuit and
this is from target i love target
swimsuits are really cute so it looks
like this it's just white and it has a
little like medallion thing in the
middle right here and it's super cute it
has like a double-cross time if you can
see it's got like two strings and then
two strings in the back add some suit
because it's a bandeau yet it has straps
because I cannot hold on just a banjo
those things fall off and suck it white
so it makes you look pretty tan and such
and I really like this some suit so I
definitely recommend going to target of
you're looking for some cheaper
swimsuits but I believe this was around
like fifteen dollars also Ohio bark bark
also a while back i bought this swim
cover-up from victoria's secret it's
just like crochet and it's like a little
dress and it looks like this another
look like this if i'm going to the pool
or like beach but i'm not going to the
beach so where else should beach but i
mean i would rose to the beach but not
going to a beach so I need stop talking
but is why it is really nice
but over your swimsuit I like took it up
to the cashier and it's just that it was
50 dogs what book I'm sure you could
find this somewhere cheaper this is for
Victoria Seager if I didn't say that too
then I went to in urban outfitters one
that was in a different mall than mine
on to the sales section and they had an
amazing sale selection I wanted
everything but I just got one thing and
it's really simple it's a button-down
shirt and it's kind of linen it's really
really like for summertime and I we're
button-down shirts like nobody's
business or like the one thing that I
just love because they match with pretty
much everything and it's so well made I
just love it I love her but not but
isn't stuff like my favorite store but
it's an ice cream color so matches of
the lot and this is only I think like
twenty dollars i think it was marked
down from fifty dollars i want to say i
went to a j.crew outlet and they were
having a sale where everything in the
store was fifty percent off so including
regular priced items and sale items
first thing is a shirt and it's so cute
i love the shirt I've worn it so many
times but it looks like this it's just a
navy and white striped shirt has a
little gold anchor right here and it's
super cute super comfortable perfect for
summer and I want more of these t-shirts
from Jacobs they're so comfortable and
this fits me perfect it's an extra small
but it kind of looks a little big so 17
times so this shirt was originally $34
and then it was fifty percent also ended
up only being 17 which is quite a good
deal but you say and then of course I
had to get a pair of chino shorts and
these are super cute they're like a
seersucker kind of material and they are
pink and white stripes in their friggin
adorable and I love them these are the
city fit so they may not need chinos I
don't know that's different than chinos
they look like this and they're super
cute super summary I absolutely love
them these were originally like fifty
dollars i want to say so they were only
25 which is awesome for ginger shorts i
never by chino shorts full out because
that's insane i'm not going to pay fifty
dollars for pair of shorts even though i
just paid fifty dollars for beach
cover-up but what are you gonna do then
for the first time ever i went to
american apparel and i'm not one to be
like the whole basic brain available
american apparel kind of thing but I saw
a steal you and I are Merida's show
these in a video and had to have them so
they are bright sun Flower high-waisted
shorts that these are so cute
feel like they're such like the epitome
of summer and a pair of shorts and
they're high-waisted I know a lot of
high-waisted shorts are like up your
butt way short like ugly trashy but
these are just a really modest life
which i like is i don't like wearing
super short shorts and you like
high-waisted shorts these are perfect
cuz they're super high waisted and i'm
going to be honest these were sixty
dollars I I know I don't really own very
expensive shorts I just have a couple
forever 21 ones and then like the
occasional chino short from j.crew that
i got fifty percent off i'm also paid
for half a tease because she was being
the nice generous to mother that she is
a lobby mala then i bought quite a few
nail polishes because if you don't know
i am a nail polish addict if you see my
room tour i have quite a few nail
polishes just because i love nail polish
summers I have to Essie nail polishes I
don't really know if I've shown these in
a video is about from kohls because Cole
started recently selling nail polishes
in mall ball Matt because i love sem so
the first one is called bond with
whomever and this is part of one of
their not new new collector buy things
for the spring line but it's a nice
purple lavender color and it's really a
bright lavender it's not like a dull one
and it's going to show up on your nails
which i love and i think i have one
other lavender nail polish but it's kind
of chunky now so i got another purple
one and this is jamaica me crazy which
is the best name ever i just want to say
like it's like a bright bright purple
with tons of just gold and orange reflex
in it so it's super pretty i love to
wear this on my toes i warned it quite a
few times it's very summery I don't know
why I'm taking out the cap brush so then
I sister yesterday was feeling very very
sweet and she bought me some china glaze
nail polish which china lease is
probably one of my ultimate favorite
brands probably goes se even China Glaze
to nail polishes the first one is called
turned up turquoise and it's a beautiful
super bright turquoise color with a
bunch of really small blue shimmer in it
so it's gorgeous for summer I had a sore
my toes right now and I absolutely love
it I'd show you my toes but people have
some weird things with feet so and then
this one is one of my ultimate favorite
it is trying to glaze refresh me this is
my favorite favorite mint nail polish I
edori I have it on right now it's super
opaque season Bertie long I wanted to
get a new one
and all of us those are each like 650 I
think about them sally's beauty store
and if you brought to china glaze nail
polishes you got a free nail tech and
drop screen eotech intensive therapy
nail strengthener is her soft pili nails
which I definitely have short nails I am
a nail biter I know if you're not in
nail biter you don't really understand
like how could you possibly bite your
nails but I know it's the worst habit i
had I've been trying to get rid of it
forever so I really thought about this
for free it's a nice strengthener this
is like ten dollars i think you know
gone for free so it's pretty good deal
with you that's the end of this hall I
hope it's a little longer than my normal
videos i'm trying to make longer videos
because people have been really getting
on to me about that so also i am
definitely making a summer morning
routine i just have been procrastinating
it because i want it to be really good
but I just feel not you don't need to
request that because on I'm on that but
if you have any other requests just make
sure to tell me because in a summer now
and I basically do nothing all I do is
home videos so if you have any requests
definitely tell me and i'll see you guys
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
