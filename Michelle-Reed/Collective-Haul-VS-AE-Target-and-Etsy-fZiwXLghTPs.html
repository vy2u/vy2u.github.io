today I'm going to doing a haul video
because i haven't done one in quite a
bit of time and i feel like i've
accumulated a bunch of stuff to show you
guys over like the past month or so and
so i decided i would do this the first
thing i got is something from victoria's
secret because i absolutely love
victoria secret it's super overpriced
but everything is so cute and comfy and
it's my weekend so i got a pair of
sweats because i absolutely love
victoria secret sweats and these ones
are just kind of like a faded blue and
then it has a BS heart in coral with
like sequins all over it and the inside
is fleece and they're so comfortable
literally every day after I come home
from school I put on some form of
sweatpants or yoga pants and so I cannot
wait to wear these they're so comfy and
cute and I just love it i'm saying i
bought off of etsy and this is a shirt
actually want this a while back but i
never showed it to you guys and so cute
so i decided to but it's just a plain
navy shirt with a frock it on it the
pocket just has kind of a seersucker
pattern with an anchor and my monogram
and i absolutely love it it's so cute
it's just a cute t-shirt for whatever
you're feeling like not dressing up and
so i'll try to find the etsy store and
link it down below i'm not sure if i'll
find it because i want this a while back
but i really like this i think it's also
from etsy i have a quite a big addiction
to add see I got this shirt and if you
watch Parks and Recreation you know what
this is from its ron swanson and it has
Ron Swanson space on it says meet on
bond because he loves meat and it's just
great i actually got another one for my
boyfriend and because you watched the
show together but i absolutely love this
shirt it's a softest t-shirt i own and
it's so comfortable and has Iran to
office based on it so I couldn't resist
the next time I too was american eagle
and i just picked up some more genes
because i only like american eagle jeans
the first one is if your white jeans
which I don't own any light jeans I just
have so many dark wash jeans and so I
decided to switch it up and these are
just kind of light wash go down and
they're straight I like jeans a lot of
people like you jeans are so
uncomfortable I think jeans are really
really comfortable like the ones I'm
wearing right now are so comfortable I
don't understand how people don't like
them but and then I also got another
pair of supers direction easier is my
typical dark wash one's a little more
flu than black which I only gets but all
of them I love these jeans they're comfy
and I wear them with everything and
american eagle jeans are my absolute
favorite so yeah if you're looking for
good genes i would definitely recommend
american eagle the next one I went to is
target because target is my obsession
it's probably my favorite storage
because target has everything you could
possibly need the first thing I got is a
swimsuit which I know I'm crazy because
it's februari and I'm buying a swimsuit
but I really don't care this one was
really cute it's just a teal one of
these like class b1 so do you think ones
that kind of like bras but i don't know
i think they're really like supportive
and when you're swimming you don't
really want something well now so i love
target some states because they kind of
mock victoria secret ones and so they
look exactly the same yet they're like a
third of the black thing I got from
Target is these knee-high fuzzy songs
I've never seen these before and it's
all then I was like I have CNM and
they're just knee high fuzzy socks and
I've never seen these before and like is
this real life right now they're so
comfortable and i love that there is so
long and they're awesome they had a
bunch of different colors but i like
this purple color so i got them and
they're really cheap maybe like four
dollars but I
so for my friend katie's birthday party
we did some shopping and we stopped by
Delia's and I haven't shopped there
since I was in like intermediate school
and I found this cardigan that looks
exactly like the brandy melville one I
don't know it's called but it's just an
open it like huge sweater cardigan with
a hood on the back and keep you not this
looks exactly like the brandy melville
one it's 3490 which is kind of expensive
but it's half the price of the brandy
melville one it looks literally the same
exact way so if you're wanting the
gritty Melville sweater that looks like
this definitely go to Delia's because
this is identical and it's so much
cheaper and I love it that I'm so i've
also been shopping at a site called
choice a lot lately and they have super
cute like just unique clothes and i
revived it how do I close them lately
and so I want to show you guys a few
things I got from there the first one is
this dress which is not going to be
everyone's cup of tea you I understand
it's kind of weird but I like it it's
just a cream color dress and it goes out
into the skirt that has red and black
and yellow like floral patterns all over
and it short sleeves and asked how like
these cap sleeves almost a call of it
it's so cute and dainty I haven't been
over where this though because I don't
know what to wear it too but it's super
cute and I'm really excited to find
something to wear that too I also got a
little black dress this is my first
little black dress and I love it I
showed this in my previous video or one
of my previous videos I was like getting
ready for a date but it's just a very
simple black like kind of almost a
sweetheart neckline kinda and it drapes
into this skirt it's pretty short which
I'm not really okay with doesn't really
like wearing short stuff but so
comfortable it's so comfy and I love it
it's really stretching it was really
cheap too but it looks like this and
it's so cute and I just don't really
know where to wear it too though cause
is so short but I will find some way to
where the ass about this shirt which is
just an oversized denim
down shirt which I just love these
because they're very simple and I could
just sort of black jeans and some flats
and they look really cute but I love
them and I also like to add my statement
statement I also like to add my
statement necklaces to them and make
them look really cute so really love is
everything that I have for this whole
video I really hope you guys enjoyed it

below because we've kind of been stuck
with videos so enjoy the rest of your
day or night or morning or whenever
