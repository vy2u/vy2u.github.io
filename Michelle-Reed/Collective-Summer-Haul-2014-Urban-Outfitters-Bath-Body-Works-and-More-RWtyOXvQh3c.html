summer collective haul because I love
hauls you guys love hauls and I am a
Shopaholic no shame and I've accumulated
quite a few things because in the summer
I just tend to buy war I don't know what
it is like this video if you enjoy my
haul videos or any haul videos because I
want to keep doing them in the future
let's just go ahead and get into this
video so the first place I ordered
things from is choice and it's basically
just a high-fashion kind of
international website first thing I
purchased was a kimono and it's super
duper colorful and floral and it has
really cute fringe on the sleeves and
theme for the kimonos are so comfy for
the summer and they're just the epitome
of summer also bought this dress and
it's just a very thin kind of
fit-and-flare dress it's white with aqua
and pink and navy designs on it so
pretty looks like something cerebellar
would wear quite pretty something I
probably wear it to something a little
more formal then as soon as I bought our
swimsuits and these are so cute I'm
actually in love the first one is a
cobalt blue color and it has a light
blue bow on it and it's a bandeau and it
ties in the back which is great because
you can control how tight you want it to
be early like this one also got it in
this really pretty banana yellow color
with a light pink bow on it and it also
ties and these are so cute and they're
just I love it they're gonna be perfect
to tanin since they are Bandos yes okay
with bottoms but these are extremely
cheeky bottoms it may not look like it
but they are cheeky and something about
me is girl I do not like my butt hanging
out on my swimsuit I know that's a trend
right now but I just know the next place
that I went to was Urban Outfitters and
I went in the sales section because
there's sales section rocks and I got
this dress it's just a horizontal
striped straight dress so there's no
cinching nothing at all it's just neat
and crate and the back is my favorite it
has a bow and the straps came to cross
and then it buttons down so it's so cute
and it's just very simple and classy and
I think I'm gonna wear this on my
birthday which is July first also
purchase these shorts they're just kind
of maroon high-waisted shorts they're
not too short or anything though buckets
are just simple and I've worn these so
much because I feel like they make me
look a little tanner
so with that dress I can't wear a normal
bra or else it'll show so I picked up a
super light adhesive bra aka sticky bra
from Target I've never worn one of these
and they kind of scare me actually so
yeah we're gonna see how this works so
then I went to Goodwill with a couple of
my friends before seeing the owner
Soares and I found quite a few things
first thing I got is this oversized
coral button up which I'm going to wear
as a cover-up babe where's to the beach
or something I'm totally kidding I don't
even live near a beach I will wear this
to the pool and it's so comfy such a
good color for summer a bright coral and
it's the brand coughed and Bureau that's
right now
also purchased this button-up pink top
kind of thing which I know is not
everyone's cup of tea I thought it'd be
cute with some chinos and a statement
necklace it kind of had like a 60s vibe
or 70s or whatever time era that was
also purchase this dress which is from
forever 21 originally and it has polka
dots and it's Navy and it flows out and
I like it because it's not too short
everything nowadays is so short and it
drives me insane then I went to airy and
I bought some swim suit bottoms these
are just coral plaid bottoms and they're
in between like a high-waisted style in
just a normal style and I love that
they're so flattering they cover your
butt I like some sue bottoms that cover
my butt I don't want my butt hanging out
I just don't like how that looks on
or even other people I just think keep
it coffee please
so if you want something that covers up
your but yet still makes you look good
it definitely look into these swim
bottom also in the summer I don't really
like wearing a normal bra as if that
makes sense so I picked up some of these
bra let's from Erie
this one's just kind of like a blush
pink color I have the white went on
right now a lot of these bra lights
don't have a whole lot of support but
this one has pads in it so it covers
everything and it makes you feel like
you have support and that's why I like
it about the Body Works was having their
semi-annual sale so I figured I'd go
ahead and pick up the candle little did
I know this was not even on sale that it
is my life I got the mahogany teak wood
one aka the boyfriend canto cuz it
smells like good smelling boys and it's
awesome I've already burned quite a bit
of it already as you can see but this is
definitely my favorite candle because it
smells divine and the very last thing I
bought was from a both Tiki kind of
story it's just a mustard yellow
wristlet because sometimes in the summer
I just don't want to carry a purse I
just want to be able to walk out put
something on my wrist and go and so I
bought this cuz it matched my purse if I
wanted to use it as a wallet so that is
the end of my haul video really really
