this video because it is my first and
maybe only doraville I'm not really sure
I want to do a really quick disclaimer
and kind of tell you guys about my
living situation because I think that
definitely affects like the hall itself
I'm living in New York if you don't know
and I'm staying in an apartment but it's
kind of a dorm style apartment so
basically we have one room and I have a
roommate your name is Lauren and we
share a kitchen and then we also have a
bathroom and so it's kind of like a
studio apartment but it is like an
apartment building it's not to the
school because my school is just like a
building that is my living situation and
so I don't want to buy a ton of stuff
here because I live in Texas and I'm
going to be flying there and so I can't
necessarily like bring everything with
me obviously I have like two suitcases
and then the rest of the stuff I have to
ship the stuff I am going to be shipping
to myself but it's not a ton of stuff
because like I said I don't want us to
pay to ship like a ton of stuff also if
you're new you should have to subscribe
I upload twice a week I know a lot of
people enjoy watching dorm haul videos
so my name is Michelle I'm going to be a
freshman in college if you're interested
you should definitely stick around
because I'm going to be making a ton of
college videos here coming up so before
I get into the stuff I want to talk
about a really cool company and I say a
really cool company I mean a really cool
company it's called dough's and
basically windows is it is a mattress
company that sells mattresses to college
students and young graduates it's ladies
mattresses are super reasonably priced
but they are so unbelievably comfortable
and basically all they do is ship it
straight to your house I know a lot of
you guys who are watching this video are
probably moving into apartments and you
guys are looking for mattresses I know
the mattress shopping experience is
awful having to go to so many different
retail stores and compare prices and
make sure you're getting the best deal
and work with people who are probably
working on Commission so they're just
going to tell you you know what you want
to hear all you do is you go on to the
dough's website and they have a ton of
different sizes that you can choose from
and you pick the size that you want and
they ship it directly to your house and
it arrives in like three to five days
which is absolutely incredible they're
made with premium gel memory foam and
also a foam core so they're super super
comfy you can have such a
night sleep on them because I know as
college students you know we are so busy
we probably don't want to stay up all
night with an uncomfortable mattress and
so it's really important just having
something that's comfortable and you're
wondering like hey Michelle these
mattresses are pretty cheap you know why
are they cheap or be sketchy definitely
not sketchy they're just cheaper because
they don't have to pay like to put them
in retail stores and pay people to sell
them and since they are just online and
they're going directly to the consumer
you don't have to pay for all the extra
stuff because if you're ballin on a
budget like myself having a cheap
mattress is good company was actually
created by a college student himself who
endured the pains of mattress shopping
and so he wanted make it easier for
people like himself and so I think
that's so cool I love supporting like
small businesses and startups and seeing
them grow and just personally that's
kind of what I want to do I love my
dough's mattress and I definitely think
you would too I wish I could bring it
with me to New York City like so bad but
since I can't take out you know my
college stuff or the dorm stuff it's
like protocol or whatever definitely
when I move into my own apartment I'm
going to be using this mattress because
it is so comfortable you're interested
in purchasing your own zoe's mattress
definitely use my coupon code Michelle
Reed and it gets you 50 dollars off your
mattress which can definitely help I
know does it sound like a lot but in the
long run fifty dollars can save you a
lot so definitely use that check out
those it'll be linked down below it's
like the first link down there so a lot
of the stuff that I wanted to buy for my
door is like gallery wall stuff because
I want to make a gallery wall from
Marshalls I bought this canvas it's just
a really pretty like gold and gray kind
of watercolor canvas it's not really
picking up off your there goes you were
pretty and just like metallic and shiny
and I kind of want to stick with gold
and like neutral colors got two things
from Urban Outfitters Urban Outfitters
sales section is awesome first thing is
aq which I know you're probably like
shell why do you have the Q letter but
it was on sale and I thought it was cute
and so I just bought it
so yeah almost like a little edging
design I just think it's really cute
then I also got this mirror which is
just a really really pretty gold mirror
that you hang up like so and I just
thought it was pretty it was really
cheap it's actually like really good
quality I would
think that this would be but it goes
with the gold theme I'm obsessed with
ordering prints online I think they're
so pretty I might frame this but I might
not but it's just a little picture of a
girl with the camera who I feel like
kind of looks like me I believe this is
from paper stores
I'm pretty sure I'll have it linked down
below if I could find it but it was only
about $20 because they were on sale so I
decided to pick that up that's what this
one that my mom got me for graduation
but I wanted to show you guys it just
says hello darling and so I'm going to
hang that up there I picked up this
calendar from Walmart because I was
doing a collaboration with them on
Instagram but I really like it it's just
gold and white and it's really simple
but I like that it's pretty big and you
can hang it up I'm lining this up above
my desk or something really like it I
think it's nice just having like all of
your dates and stuff on there next thing
that I have is actually something that I
will also got me for graduation but it
just says there are always flowers for
those who want to see them and it's by
Henri Matisse that quo and I really like
it I just having the gold frame I don't
know if I'm going to take the frame with
me because it'll definitely weight it
down shifting but it this goes really
really well with all the other prints
and they'll kind of complement each
other so for my bedding I actually
wanted to go with a blush pink color and
have kind of gray and white pillows I
love blush pink and grey I think it's
really pretty yet so I just ordered this
super simple linen duvet cover from Etsy
it's a really really pretty color it's a
little more pink on camera than it is a
person it's more like a dusty rose I
love it it is so soft so I do have to
buy the Tuesday to go in it it also came
with a sham which is nice I won't have
to buy this but really really good
quality I'll have it linked down below
it is expensive but I feel like if I'm
going to spend a lot on one thing I've
wanted to be my bedding because
obviously I spend a lot of time in my
bed because I like to sleep off this
bedding and this can probably fit my
suitcase which is nice always have to
buy the DVD cover there get a couple of
pillows which I didn't really think
about shipping these and so I don't
necessarily know if I'm gonna bring
these but I have this one from Marshalls
but it's just a really long like
cream-colored pillow that's really
really fuzzy and comfortable I love
pillows I'm gonna have so many pillows
on my bed I really like this and then I
got this one from Walmart because
honestly guys I don't like to spend a
lot of money on pillows I think spending
a lot of money on pillows is a waste
like Urban Outfitters pillows and
anthropology pillows are like 50 to 60
dollars and I refuse to pay over 20
bucks for one and so I got this one that
has almost little like roses on you I
don't you can tell but so so comfortable
I love it and Walmart has a ton of great
pillows too if you're looking for some
that are a little bit cheaper that's
everything that I have to show you guys
I know it wasn't like a ton of stuff or
anything but like I told you guys I
can't really buy a ton of stuff here if
you'd like to follow me along on my
college journey definitely follow me on
my social medias Instagram and Twitter
