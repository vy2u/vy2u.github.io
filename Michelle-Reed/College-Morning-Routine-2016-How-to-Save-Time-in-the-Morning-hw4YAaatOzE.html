quickly wanted to do an intro to this
video basically you're about to watch my
college morning routine I recently did a
weekend one but I wanted to do one that
was actually my morning just so I can't
give you guys some tips on getting ready
quickly
ever since moving to college though I
really learned you know how to get rid
of quickly because I do have to take the
subway to school and I have to commute
and so it takes a while and so these are
my tips and tricks and I hope you guys
enjoy also what I mention in this video
I am working with a company called
unique which is a drone company I am
featuring their breeze drone which is so
so cool basically all the shots at the
end of this video were filmed with this
and I just wanted to talk about it a
little bit because I think it's so
incredible basically why I like this
drone is first and foremost it's so easy
to use
obviously I'm new to drums and so I do
not know everything about them but using
the breeze has been absolutely
incredible it's so easy to use basically
you just hook it up to your phone you
have all your features on there it has
one for a selfie mode and orbit a follow
me a pilot so you can do everything on
your phone and it is wireless in my
videos I'm used to always having you
know the same angles and videos but
we're using this you definitely get to
see new perspectives on things just feel
like you're hanging out with your
friends and stuff it's so easy just to
take along with you ice wise it is
definitely relatively more inexpensive
compared to other drones which I know a
lot of you guys are younger and you
don't have the money to spend on a
really really nice drone but this one is
relatively inexpensive compared to those
and it's still awesome quality like the
quality on this is so good guys it has
4k as 1080p and so like it because it is
smaller so it's compact so you can fit
this in a backpack in a case and you can
take it with you whenever you're going
on like a vacation or trip with your
friends I'll have a link to the unique
breeze drone down below that you should
definitely check out because it is my
new baby guys and living in New York
City I can get such incredible shots
with this thing and I definitely think
if you're in the market or a drone or
you just want something to like have fun
with your friends with it's so good so
it's pretty much all you have to say and
let's just go
and get into the video so I usually wake
up for class at about 7 o'clock
since my classes start at 9:00 and I
live in New York City so I have to
commute to class on the subway so I will
typically wake up at around 7 and my
biggest tip for you guys would be to not
check your phone right when you get up I
know this is such a bad habit so try not
to do that and instead of you know
messing with your phone or whatever try
to just make your bed and get up and
relax it maybe play music but just avoid
going on your phone because we all know
that leads to snoozing and getting on
social media and it's not good then I
just go and I make a cup of coffee and I
get a glass of water just cuz I think
it's important to hydrate in the morning
I know coffee is not the best thing but
it always wakes me up whenever I'm doing
my makeup and stuff I just like to drink
my coffee in the bathroom so then I will
head in there and I would just go ahead
and splash some cold water on my face
this always wakes me up right whenever I
get out of bed so I do still like to
wear makeup to college just because I do
have a dress code so I first just apply
my primer all over my face and then I
mix my foundation and my moisturizer and
I blend it with my hands to save time
then I just go in with my concealer and
i conceale my eyes and once I have is to
use bronzer as eyeshadow if you're in a
time crunch because it's super quick and
it looks good and then I just brush in
some of my gimme brow product to my
brows and I line my eyes very lightly
with eyeliner then I just apply my under
eye concealer because I always have bags
because I never get sleep in college
real talk guys then I just set
everything with my Laura Mercier powder
and I apply my bronzer all over my
cheekbones and just a little bit of
blush to make me look a little bit more
awake and then I just apply my rocket
mascara and some chapstick and that is
my very easy College makeup routine
literally takes like 5 minutes guys her
hair I will usually just straighten my
hair since my hair is naturally already
pretty straight so I just kind of
straighten it or about five minutes
throw it into a middle part and it looks
more put together than it actually is
then I will go and I will pick out my
outfit and make myself a breakfast
oatmeal's super easy for me to make in
the morning it takes like five minutes
and it fills me up because I don't like
to skip on breakfast guys because it's
so so important then I'll usually just
like to eat this and I will finish up my
homework that I didn't finish the night
before and then my roommate will
make me laugh because she's funny and
then I will just go ahead and I will
head out the door and get on the subway
because I live about 15 minutes from my
classes this is honestly my favorite
part of my morning I love commuting
because my neighborhood is beautiful and
exploring New York City is just really
really cool and having that fifteen
minutes to myself is the best now I do
have a business casual dress code so I
can't really just throw on leggings but
one thing I like to do is wear oversized
coats so you know you can't really see
what I'm wearing underneath and it looks
like I'm put together but I'll have all
the pieces link down below if you want
to check out exactly what I'm wearing
but this is typically something I would
wear to class yeah I honestly love
living in New York City and I love
exploring which is one of the main
reasons why I love the breeze drone
because you can see so so many cool
angles of New York and I can just
explore with my friends and use it and
it's honestly just such a cool device
especially for living here
but again I'll have the unique drone
link down below if you want to check it
out it's definitely been one of my
favorite things living in the city and
it just made experiencing the city so so
so much better
so I really hope you guys enjoyed
watching this video I had so so much fun
filming it for you guys I love love
little morning routine videos again if
you want to check out the unique breeze
drone it'll be linked down below you
should definitely check it out should
also go follow me all my other social
medias since I am in college I'm always
posting on those even if I am NOT here
on my channel but yeah I'll see you guys
in my next video bye friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
