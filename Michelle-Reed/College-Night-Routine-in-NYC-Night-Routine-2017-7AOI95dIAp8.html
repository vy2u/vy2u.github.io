College night repeat currently a college
unit in New York City so this is my
routine that I do every single day at
night time also on the roof of my
apartment right now it's a little bit
noisy so I'm sorry if you're new to my
channel you should definitely subscribe
the buttons down below I upload beauty
fashion and lifestyle content you also
go follow my other social medias which
will be linked right here I always is
posting all my instagrams you should
definitely check it out so basically
everything that I have to stay for the
night routine so I'll just go ahead and
get into the video so my night routine
usually starts at college my last class
ends at about 3 o'clock so this is more
so like in the afternoon but my school
is actually in New York City and so this
is our view outside our classroom it's
super super nice after I finish all my
work in class I just pack up and I get
ready to go
I usually like to put in my headphones
and start my commute at home since I do
have to get on the subway I've been
loving Sam Cooke playlist right now I
just love his music it's so good for
getting on the subway too
so then I just head down the elevator
and head out the door
i weirdly really enjoy like communing to
and from school just because everything
is so pretty and there's always
something new to see in New York so I
just head down and I get on the subway
to get back home this subway station
that I get off at is actually the cutest
thing ever I always have to resist
buying flowers every time I walk by
because they're always so pretty but I
just head back into my apartment and I
usually like to change into something a
little bit comfier and then I just head
to the bathroom and kind of wash my face
and whatnot and just chill for a second
I usually grab a snack during this
period - I didn't actually show that
this is what I usually do homework this
actually lasts like five or six hours in
reality I know it looks like I'm sitting
here for like 20 minutes but I do
homework a lot a lot a lot for college
but having this view to look out while I
do my homework thanks everything is so
so much better so at this point it's
usually about 6 or 7 o'clock and I'm
usually finished up so I will put away
my stuff and then head out to go eat
some dinner with my boyfriend now I
don't always like eat out for sure some
nights I cook dinner but a lot of nice
we'll just go and walk around our
neighborhood and go grab something to
eat because the neighborhood is so so
pretty I absolutely love it
so this is what I usually do what we
usually varies a lot sometimes we go out
to nicer places sometimes we just like
stay around the neighborhood but it was
really really pretty this night it was
actually not super difficult and the
view was beautiful and it was sunset so
really really good evening this is one
of our favorite restaurants to eat at it
has basically like everything you could
possibly imagine and it's so so yummy I
usually get a potato because I really
like baked potatoes I don't eat meat and
so potatoes are like the easiest thing
to fill you up if you're not eating meat
but after that I just head back home and
I start getting ready I just wash my
face and take off my makeup usually go
to bed at about midnight and every night
because I'm usually doing homework for
such a long time but then I also shower
since I have class at 9:00 a.m. so I
don't like a shower in the morning and
then I just put on my moisturizer wash
my face and then I get into bed and I
usually have to do some last-minute
reading in bed before I hit the hay and
that is everything for my college night
routine I really hope you guys enjoyed

below

routine looks like down below you should
