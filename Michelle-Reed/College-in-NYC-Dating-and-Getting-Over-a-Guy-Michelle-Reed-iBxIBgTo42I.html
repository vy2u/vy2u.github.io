be doing an advice video for you guys
the last video that I posted which is
talking all about dating and
relationships you guys gave me really
really good feedback and so I decided to
do another one this week if you're new
to my channel you suddenly hit the
subscribe button down below I upload a
nice fashion and lifestyle videos and I
upload about once a week so you should
definitely check that out always being
cool stuff here in the city so if you
want to check it out something make sure
to follow my Instagram as always I also
asked for questions on there so if you
want to be featured in my next one you
guys asked literally like over like 200
questions I'm going to go ahead and get
right into this video is it hard to
attend college in New York City like how
do you manage to balance your studies so
much to do / see around you I feel like
the biggest thing for me personally is
yes there is a ton of stuff to do in
York City the thing is I am all about
saving money right now I don't actually
want to spend a lot of my money and love
it are a lot of free things you can do
in New York City a lot of stuff costs
money as I feel like the biggest thing
for managing your time in college is not
spending all your time like doing fun
stuff instead of your studies it just
has a motivation not wanting to spend
money because it makes it a whole lot
easier
I don't move on from a guy that you had
strong feelings for I definitely think
this is something that varies from
person to person and the most important
thing first is it making sure that you
have closure with this person if you're
in a place where you don't know where
you're at if you're talking to this guy
or if you're completely ignoring him or
you're completely passive not having
that closure makes getting rid of those
feelings a lot more difficult work on
yourself whether I'd be putting all of
those feelings into a talent or
something a hobby a job something that
you you know maybe didn't have the
chance to do while you're dating this
person for me one thing that was really
important was working out I think
working out is such a good way to fuel
all of those feelings that you used to
have because a you're going to do work
out also it's just an hour or an hour
and a half of your time where you can
just put into you know working your body
instead of working in life I think
lastly the most important thing would be
just knowing that everything does happen
for a reason and just because you know
this guy they have not worked out for
you that doesn't mean someone else why
not and also does it mean that you can't
spend that time working on yourself how
do you bring up the subject
a purity cig I see me and are interested
in I am in college and it seems like
every guy just wants my money
I feel like this question is probably
coming up because in my last video I
talked about that something that's
really important to me and I honestly
feel like that's something that you
should make clear up front I know in
college there's like this hookup culture
so I would just say to be upfront and I
feel like and this is a guy that
actually cares about you and you can see
pursuing a longer relationship with that
that's not going to be something that
affects him and that he should be on the
same page as you
I know it's scary especially whenever
you first start dating but I feel like
if you are in college that's something
that you should be able to talk about
with someone I'm I feel like if you can
talk about that with someone and that's
kind of an indication that you shouldn't
be dating in the first place I've never
felt so self-conscious in my life but
lately I have been feeling so down on
myself and honestly I feel like a loser
for letting stress get the best of me
what do you do when you feel like this
you can ask any one of my friends or
anyone who's ever been around me you
definitely know that I am someone who
does get stressed easily I think a just
acknowledge that you're not loser just
because you get stressed
everyone gets stressed we live in a
world where it's constantly going going
going so so fast-paced to feel stress
and feel anxiety those are normal
thoughts and normal feelings that you
should have though it doesn't make you
losers that makes you like everyone else
that makes you like me
I think it's tip would be to give
yourself time to do whatever you want to
do whether that be working out whether
that be watching Netflix whether that be
reading a book but also for me praying
is really important whether you believe
in the law whether you don't whether
meditating is your form of doing this I
think having quiet time for me to talk
to the Lord and actually like put my
problems out writing them out is so so
valuable and it also helps eliminate
stress and especially anxiety what's the
most important lesson you've learned in
college so far and with your best piece
of advice to a college freshman so first
and foremost I am finishing out my
freshman year of college so I'm almost
done which is so crazy I think the most
important things that I've learned this
is something that my mom used to tell me
in high school that I would never
actually take it to heart but just that
all you can do is all you can do I feel
like for me I have a tendency to always
feel like I'm not doing enough feeling
like you know my grades are as good as
it
be feeling like I'm behind on YouTube
feeling like my views are down feeling
like I'm not engaging with people enough
let me know if you're also with me it
would only be better than you were
yesterday something that was really hard
for me to learn I feel like I'm still
learning this every single day I still
get worked up I still feel like I'm not
enough I still feel like I'm like in
adequate expecially in school it's
something that I didn't really grasp in
high school my biggest tip for college
freshmen would probably be stupid for
freshman college Deborah for Jessica not
spend all of your time partying and not
only focusing on your social life there
are really really cool experiences you
can have that you can actually remember
and be not regret in the long run so be
my biggest tips I have spent so much
time in college just really really
engaging in specific moments and trying
to be present at the end of the night
college is only four years and I feel
like it's really easy just to breathe by
it and go through or not take anything
in so I just recommend being present and
spending your time on real experiences
that are actually going to last because
in the long run you're going to look
back and really really enjoy those times
it feels like you actually took
advantage of college that would be my
biggest tip what is your favorite thing
about living flesh going to college in
New York so I basically wanted to live
here ever since I was really really
young I feel like that's something that
you guys probably know because I talk
about it like all the times I'm really
really sorry my favorite thing about
going to school here is feeling like
like yes I'm in college but also feeling
like I'm starting a life for myself I
feel like a lot of people who go to
university they go somewhere and then
they go back home but for me I want to
see in New York long term and it's
something that I want to build my life
here so cool being in college and
already getting to start that process of
like finding a job getting internships
also it's near a city that was always
something to do and it's beautiful and I
love my neighborhood and I'm so so
blessed I could not ask for anything
more so many good things out living in
New York City and it's the part that was
really expensive but other than that I
love it and I've been having a blast I
crush them in here when I that's all
that I have to share with you guys I
really really hope you guys enjoyed this
advice video if you did give me a thumbs
up and also let me know down below and
the
comments I love reading you guys's
comments they literally warm my heart
and they're the absolute best thing you
should also go watch my last video it'll

other social medias I love you guys so
so much and I'll see you guys next week
