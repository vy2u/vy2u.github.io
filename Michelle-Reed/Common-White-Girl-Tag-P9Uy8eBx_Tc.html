fun little tag video that I've been
seeing going around and it is the common
white girl tag and I'm really wishing I
was basic enough to actually have
Starbucks here some company in this
video just kidding I do but I just
wanted to say before that this video
that this title and the title of this
video it's not just be offensive I know
some people can take it in the wrong way
and if you are one of those people feel
free to just exit out of this and leave
your mean comments to your brain I'm not
trying to be racist or anything here
it's just a fun video that's been going
around so without further ado I'm just
going to go ahead and get started the
first question is your favorite
Starbucks drink and that is very very
hard for anybody who is a basic probably
mine would be the iced caramel
macchiatos those are really really good
I love those and then one more time I
like the peppermint hot chocolate that's
delicious but mostly I just get
something that's like iced coffee or
along the realm of that and I do not
like pumpkin spice lattes so I feel like
I lose a few points on the basic level
there are two of us how long does it
take you to get ready in the morning and
I actually have practice in the morning
for drill team and so I only have about
like twenty to thirty minutes and that's
basically how long it takes me so about
twenty to thirty minutes but if I'm
actually at home and getting ready it'll
take me a good bit longer because I
actually try to present myself better
but just for school ones up is about
twenty minutes
number three is how many selfies do you
take on a daily basis I do not take a
selfie each day like buy any it probably
will be like once a week and I'm not
really into the whole like I saw me
holding my camera that kind of thing
because I just like using pictures that
I take on my good old DSLR that I love
but I'm not really to the whole
something thing that much but 80 watts a
we go
say or once every two weeks or so number
for us how many Instagram followers in
pictures you have it so I'm just gonna
go on here and see I have eight thousand
seven hundred and twenty three followers
and I have two hundred and twenty three
pictures so five is do you ever say lol
oMG out loud yes I do I don't see oMG
but I say lol but it's kind of just
sarcasm just like oh wow like it's
coming to the point where it's not
sarcasm anymore and it's kind of
becoming a problem and I need to solve
this my fix is do you wear the same
clothing item or more than once and yes
I do I don't know who wears different
clothing item every single day that's
insane hello my name is Elvira Pete
outfits 7 is are you racist and I think
this is the dumbest question ever I
can't even understand why this is in
here are like common white girls
supposed to be racist no not reason
ain't guess how many tweets you have and
not that obsessive Twitter I don't
really think I have 1343 tweets so I
don't really know that's considered a
lot to some people but not a lot to
others so 9 is Instagram Twitter or
tumblr and considering it don't have a
tumblr because I try to get one once and
I didn't get it at all just Jurina but I
like Instagram the best probably cuz I
like looking at other peoples pictures
and I feel like it's fun because you're
feeling edit them and make them all cute
and post adorable selfies and it's just
awesome 10 is what do you spend most of
your time doing and that would probably
be on this little guy right here
yeah double right here filming and
editing videos and dancing and school
and homework is basically what I do
that's my life summed up a lot of it is
who are your favorite youtubers my
absolute favorite favorite favorite
youtuber of all time is danceOn on fire
he's literally I wish he was my older
brother he's the funniest guy I have
ever watched it I feel like he just kind
of says my life in videos and
other than that I love hello Katie XO
she's my favorite beauty youtuber
because she's different and she inspires
me so hello kitty hello I love you it's
so Domino now probably Helen Keaney XO
and dance on fire aren't to you for it
you to focus how often do you do your
nails and I never do my fingernails
basically because I have a problem with
like fighting them and shipping them and
they're just a gross but my toenails I
always have to have painted because I
hate the look of unto toenails like I
just I don't like it at all so I paint
my toenails like every week because I
like to brush thirteen is are you a
Shopaholic it I was so prone to
impulsive eyes that's the one thing that
just i guilty up but I haven't gone
shopping in over a month
like physically shopping so I would say
I'm not really a Shopaholic honestly but
I am an impulsive buyer 14 is how many
times have you watched Mean Girls and I
watched it quite a few times I don't
know exactly how many times I've watched
Mean Girls if you do I think that's a
little sad but I have watched it this T
is do you own a lot of clothes and I
wouldn't say I have that many clothes
because I've seen youtubers and they
know I'd say it's have a kind of an
average amount of clothes for a girl not
too much but not too little
16's do you take pictures of your food
before you eat it and no I am not guilty
of this I hate when people do this with
you go on their Instagram and only
posted food it's like I don't really
care what you're eating and I'm sorry
the people know the T is do you wear
makeup every day and yes I do I like to
make my
know what I mean I guess I could go like
make them listen I wanted to because
doesn't really bother me but yes I do
for the most part 18 is what are your
average grades in school and I usually
get like all A's and then I might get
like a couple of days here and there and
that's how I am like last semester I had
a B in English but everything else was
an 8 so 18 is how do you usually style
your hair um basically how you see it is
how it is every day because I can't curl
excite practice but I really like
curling my hair I insert a picture of it
maybe but I will either curl it or
straighten it and those are living into
things that do home alone and nobody's
watching me my hair is like in this
rat's nest do but for the most part just
straight or curly whatever I feel not
being lazy to do that 20 is do you
always look presentable and I would say
no if you saw me the 75% of time I am
looking like being hot vest on even
hafez just a mess because it's not cute
but whenever I go in public I'd like to
look presentable I don't really like to
scrub I think this would they call it
and that is everything in this video and
I will leave some people that I tagged
if anybody's loved that hasn't done this
because literally all my friends have
done this on YouTube hope you guys
didn't take it too offensively or
anything but I will see you as that next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
