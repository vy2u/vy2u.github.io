advice video just on my confidence
finding friends I love it yeah a lot of
you guys wanted to like no like going
into school like a lot of tips and
confidence so yeah so we decided that's
also I want to say Rose makes her own
videos and she makes videos like mine
that are like beauty and fashion and
random and all that good stuff so
definitely go subscribe click her face
if you want to I don't even know if I
can do that mostly just check it down I
asked for questions on my Instagram that
y'all had we have 10 questions that we
picked and we have 10 answers so let's
just say go ahead and okay so hotels got
asked what do I do if I have no one to
sit with that lunch actually frozen is
that the same to you last year now we're
kind of loading yeah well like when you
go in your first thing make sure you
like just scan the room I guess yeah
scan the lunchroom yeah
like you don't want this that was
somebody that like you're best friends
with because I can tell you you're
probably not gonna have your best
friends in your lunch because school
needs you don't mix it with someone that
looks like someone looks like someone
you're not gonna want to get it because
honestly there's definitely people who
don't know people at lunch you're not
the only one you're probably like
everyone else I'm with you because I am
Chloe Tatum asked what do you do if you
have classes without friends there's
always gonna be that one class yeah like
I had one class last year I literally
didn't know anybody I don't take it as
an opportunity to focus more on your
work oh is that one classy kind of
absolutely get to focus in yeah please
to your advantage same time don't be
like totally anti-social people are
gonna open up as your goes on yeah and
there's definitely many people who don't
know people as well you're not the only
one and just know that with all these
things there are people that are with
you so skinny of anyone asks what to do
if you don't know anyone and you get
told to pair up doors don't sit there
and
like literally like hey you look like
you're alone yeah I always out the
person left behind me or next to me yeah
maybe you partner
honestly it's not a big deal it's a
partner yeah you get partner with
someone you really don't like or they're
like really quiet or like whatever
there's a huge difference yes yes it's
for closets for a great if it works it
comes to where it's just you know work
stuff
yeah there's some style tips that make
you feel more confident I would say
don't like to dress up too much to the
point where you're uncomfortable because
honestly it's school who are you trying
to impress
oh not wear what you want yes you don't
people to be like look what she's
wearing
yeah let's try hard don't worry about
that don't worry about darling wear what
you feel comfortable in like there's
only about like everyone has that one
outfit or like makeup style but the like
oh yeah my virtually ice cream choice
and I'm like everywhere I'm like I don't
want to feel confident in yeah but don't
be a distraction at the same time yeah
okay
yo its Olivia asks how do you build your
self-confidence I think confidence is
definitely something that's important in
high school because a lot of people
don't have it yeah and even like the
most confident people are still like
yeah other moments when they're like if
you are like a very quiet like sheltered
person try to surround yourself with
more like outgoing yeah I like people
that have like a positive vibe I yeah
because I don't even like kind of feed
off of it you know you have like one
different like I know Michelle I have a
good friend and like she is her she is
her her other VI friends that she gets
with and so like meeting them to that
like Morgan Avenue branch off of your
friends yeah I don't know just keep your
head up and yeah it's about lifting
yourself yeah don't walk around yeah and
don't like if you don't feel comfortable
doing something don't for myself to do
it yeah Jordan Meredith asks how to be
confident in your faith at school I can
tell you people in high school are very
opinionated and they not to say that you
shouldn't share your beliefs yeah I
think that's right but another's clothes
that are like marked towards your
religion and others
different ones for different religions
and it's awesome to get involved in
those and then also a few there's like
people that you go to church with they
go to your school yeah I mean you can
hang out with them and that's like okay
I'm gonna like see that
don't don't like hiding yeah cuz it's
also made of a high but it's a joke it's
not something to just be went yeah
that's how to be confident when
presenting in front of the class your
team OC or high schools require you to
speech or release arzo's go down don't
look people above everyone in the eyes
cuz that's ya don't do that because then
you're just gonna feel like a lot of
people are watching you I always look at
like it's a back wall yeah okay like my
friend in the front make it a
conversation like you're just talking to
the class like you guys have little
pinpoints oh you do have that on when
you're like yeah look down and then you
can end up right where you left off
that's what I hope to design a dancer 28
wants to know how to talk to people
without being nervous
that you just thing to do it so I like a
common interest on someone because I
know people say opposites attract but I
can guarantee if you're polar opposites
with somebody it's gonna be difficult
when I'm talking to someone that I don't
really know and like it's awkwardly
quiet you're kind of like yeah they have
the opportunity to say something back so
they're gonna feel the awkward silence
too so don't put all the pressure on you
because I don't do that because they're
there it also hop in the conversation
yeah but seriously like try to talk to
people that are new and that you don't
know because I know it's hard but
honestly high school such a good time to
me so that's the end of this video and I
hope we answered that y'all's questions
and in the end just don't be nervous
about this stuff I really hope this
helped you guys because that's what
we're here for
yeah yeah and if you have any other
questions make sure to leave them down
below and go subscribe to rose again
just another friendly reminder I'll see
you guys in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
