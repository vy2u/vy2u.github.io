be cooking some sugar cookie bars with
cream cheese frosting for Valentine's
Day
so while we do this we're going to
answer some questions because I put it
out for some questions like two seconds
ago just so we can like chat and bake
and just have a good evening together
yes I agree so if you're ready to my
channel you should unsubscribe button
will be your right here I've looked on
Sundays / Thursday's and I'd love for
you to subscribe so I thought that being
said we're gonna go get cookie but I
want to say we are not chefs and so if
we mess up which is highly like like
yeah which is highly like you know I
white you do not judge it happens to the
best of us and the worst of us in a
medium bowl whisk together flour salt
and baking powder
set aside many involved this one's
pretty good
yes dump it in here we have three and a
half cups of flour not flowers if you do
use the anymore hands I prefer to dance
or a nice rose one and a half teaspoons
of salt you want me to do this pretty
good and Gunnar is gonna whisk you know
what me and cats have in common
what so we've got our dry ingredients
we're gonna set them super bowl did you
guys see him on the Super Bowl us or the
Patriots football we're using one cup of
butter wait
this second stick of butter more butter
it's there are a lot of uses like I'm
putting that we're going that's it oh
yeah one and a half cups of sugar
actually really dry mashed potatoes next
year beating in two eggs the vanilla and
red food coloring okay so our first
question is you could be a food what
would you be Oh first on this one yeah
if I could be a food I wouldn't want to
be pasta because everybody loves me then
I would want to be you cannot see
jambalaya it's a little bit everything
so the next question is if you could
take a free trip anywhere in the world
right now where would it be and why
Tokyo would be super cool to go to Tokyo
we're like China yeah I kind of want to
visit the mountains in China
I feel like that'd be so cool I'm like
the old like temples and stuff like the
Great Wall of China
yeah yay we did it we did it we did it
we did it yeah so now we are going to
put the dough in this pan after Gummer's
freeze it and we're gonna answer another
question as we all know you've been down
because I don't have a wide lens what is
one thing that I like that gunner
doesn't like and vice-versa
Furby you would definitely be peanut
butter of course wants to do but gunner
is allergic to peanut air but I have
peanut butter with like absolutely
everything I eat so dr. pepper Michelle
gave up soda so I've had soda in a good
month now I probably have like at least
two or three today I'm like dying inside
yeah it feels like mints and that like
you get it Michael's in your little
we started trying to think if I wash my
hands
happy decided to make hearts instead
because we kept words weren't really
working so Gunnar
would you rather have your lips for toes
or toes for earlobes your webs for toes
you would have played no foundations of
walk I would want to have toes for your
lobes be so cool you'd have like toe
earrings on they'll be sweet
here are our little hearts they are
actually not very little they are joy
Norma's then they go at 350 since those
are cooking right now or baking right
now are you gonna make the icing so some
cream cheese so we got the cream cheese
have a cup of butter 2 cups of powdered
sugar and vanilla and a smile are you a
giver or are you a taker and give advice
on things that I know that I'm like yeah
pretty decent man coming out to take
care of advice I don't like to do I feel
like I'm definitely more of a giver I
don't like feeling obligated to take
stuff from people or like I don't like
asking for money
so we just took the hearts out and
they're looking pretty snazzy they're
not too bad a little burnt
little thick but what is something that
you are excited for right now I'm
obviously excited to move out of the
dorms and into my permit ready from out
of the room again dorm one is awful you
graduate there's a lot 2016 it's like a
big year for Beyonce so I'll be going to
college I'll feel like moving out
graduating and just like a lot of like
different stone it's either be like
really good or really bad you're
actually killing her right now like
really Taunton you're killing it so we
just finished making our cookies and we
ate some 1 out of 10 I would say
probably a four and a half say that you
could play hockey with I'm like thank
