stuff is really moisturizing and it
gives you like help you shine your lips
and it's just really great I've also
really been enjoying painting my nails
because it helps them stay longer and I
have a few summer polishes that are my
favorites and they're right here
my fossil bag is one of my favorites as
well it's just really pretty and neutral
on it matches with everything and I also
like this Coach little wallet in here I
don't have a lot of stuff and it's just
small to fit Celtic purses and then the
Sally Hansen nail cuticle cream is
really great it smells really citrusy
and it's very very moisturizing to your
hands
this sure is really summery and pretty
it's really thin and light turns red for
21 I really like the color on it I just
I've been in love with coffee this is my
favorite it's the French roast from
Starbucks I just use my cured with this
little and I really like that mug too
and he's so good it's kind of a darker
rose which I personally like a lot
better even mad shoes are really
comfortable to you and they kind of go
with everything I like my 93 runs
they're so comfortable to run in and
they weigh like nothing at all really
like this white shirt as well forever 21
it's really light and I like the cotton
material this makes it really like your
summer and I can wear this it's a
cover-up over my t-shirts and I love it
and then my puppy daisies also on my
favorites but you know she's kind of my
favorite year-round um and I really like
these videos so tell me if you want more
favorites like thank you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
