stuff is really moisturizing and it
gives you like healthy shine gear lips
and it's just really great I've also
really been enjoying painting my nails
because it helps them stay longer and i
have a few summer polishes that are my
favorites and they're right here my
fossil bag is one of my favorites as
well which is really pretty in neutral
on it matches with everything and i also
like this coach little wallet in here I
don't have a lot of stuff and it's just
small and at 15 l vs and then the sally
hansen nail cuticle cream is really
great it smells really citrusy and it's
very very moisturizing to your hands
this sure is really summery and pretty
it's really thin and light turns red for
21 I really like the color on it just
I've been in love with coffee this is my
favorite it's the french roast from
starbucks i just use not cured with this
which is also and i really like that mug
too and he's so good kind of a darker
rose which i personally like a lot
better
these magic shoes are really comfortable
really cute and they kind of go with
everything like mine thank you three
runs they're so comfortable to run in
and they were like nothing at all's
really like this white shirt as well
from perfect when t1 it's really light
and I like the cotton material this
makes it really like your summer and I
can versus a cover-up over my swimsuits
and I thought ID and then my puppy
daisies also on my favorites but you
know she's kind of my favorite year
round um and I really like these videos
so tell me if you want more favorites
like me and you guys later in back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
