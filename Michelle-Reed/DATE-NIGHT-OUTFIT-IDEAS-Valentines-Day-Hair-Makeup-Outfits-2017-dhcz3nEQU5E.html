nobility hi everybody in today's video
I'm going to be showing you guys three
date night outfit looks along with a
hair and a makeup look for Valentine's
Day I think these are super fun for
Valentine's Day if you're going out with
your friends or your boyfriend also make
sure to subscribe if you're new so just
go ahead and get into the video
super makeup I'm starting off with the
super pretty
Bobby pink and glittery look I'm
starting off with my Aveeno positively
radiant moisturizer and I'm just
applying this all over my face and then
I'm using my covergirl Ready Set
gorgeous foundation I'm just applying
this everywhere after concealing my
eyelids I am taking my lorac eyeshadow
palette I'm using the shade light pink
I'm applying this all over my lid and
then I'm applying mob in the crease and
then I'm going over and doing a cut
crease with the shape here and then I'm
going in with this eye shadow which is
from the balm it is an over eyeshadow in
the shade if you're rich I'm single and
I'm applying this all over my lid to
give a shimmery base and then I'm taking
my seal at loose glitter eyeshadow and
dusty rose and applying that over top
then I'm just concealing underneath my
eyes by Maybelline age rewind concealer
and then going over that with my almay
loose powder and I'm doing a little bit
of baking and applying the rest of the
powder all over my face and then I'm
just going in with my benefit gimme brow
and kind of thickening up my brows and
I'm just lining my eyes with my balm
liquid eyeliner which is so good at
lasts all night I love this eyeliner and
then I'm just brushing off all the
excess powder from the baking and then
I'm going in applying my flutter to full
clinic mascara and then I'm just taking
my Too Faced cocoa bronzer and I'm
applying this all over my face and then
I'm also applying a little bit blush
this is Dolce Vita from NARS then I'm
just highlighting with my Clinique
chubby highlighter and finishing off the
look with airy fairies Rimmel lipstick
for hair I'm just going with a very
loose wavy look all I'm doing is taking
my hair putting some hairspray in and
then I'm just curling it with my bond a
one-inch clamp list curling iron which
is awesome so I'm running this through
my hair not really focusing too much
trying to get it to be as loose as
possible and then I'm putting my hair
into a middle part and just going and
curling the rest of it
what I've done I'm just really shaking
it out and loosening it and also
applying some dry shampoo to get some
more volume and that is it for a my
really really quick like ten minute curl
hairstyle I love it it's superb luminous
and pretty so these are the three
outfits that I have chosen I think
they're great for all different
occasions I also want is definitely my
favorite I'm wearing this top which is
from Monto it's like the prettiest dusty
rose color and it cinches in at the
waist I just think it's so flattering
and cute and then I just have on my
Madewell jeans which I love I love me
some black jeans guys and then I just
threw over this Zara coat which is
really cute because as you can see U is
actually snowing while I was filming
this and unfortunate event fit and then
it fit for outfit one now outfit two is
definitely more dressy but I still think
that it's cute and kind of simple I'm
just wearing this bodysuit which is from
American Apparel I think body suits are
so good to just give a very flattering
look to your body and they're also easy
to tuck into skirts which mine is from
Uniqlo I think it's so pretty and flowy
and flirty it just really really cute
and then my shoes are the brand Marc
Fisher they're the cutest velvet heels
I'm obsessed and also I'm wearing my
Daniel Wellington watch and I'm wearing
that with all the outfits here and for
my last outfit I am wearing all black
with a little bit of pop of color my
sweater is from brandy melville is just
cropped and I think it looks great with
the skirt which is from the loft and
then I'm just wearing some simple black
tights but the shoes are definitely the
main focus of this outfit I think
they're so so so cute they're from
public desire and then my scarf is from
Urban Outfitters just really cute and
warm and that's it for my Valentines Day
looks for you guys I hope you guys
