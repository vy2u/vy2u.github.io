with all that being said we're gonna go
ahead and get into the video first we
will be making a salted caramel
Frappuccino so you're going to need some
milk some chocolate syrup some whipped
cream some coffee and some salted
caramel syrup as well as some caramel
syrup in my ninja bullet I am combining
a cup of ice one-half cup of cold coffee
make sure that is cold 1/2 a cup of milk
1 ounce of salted caramel serve and also
one ounce of my Hershey's syrup and you
can use a blender as well I just used my
ninja bullet until it was kind of nice
and thick and I see like a Frappuccino
and then I just put it into my cup which
was kind of a struggle added whipped
cream Hershey syrup and caramel syrup
and then I also added some sea salt and
you know that's it for the Frappuccino
super easy super tasty it is awesome
next we are making the infamous pumpkin
spice latte so I'm starting off with
some milk some sugar some whipped cream
some pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie spice
and vanilla extract
so first I'm adding a cup of milk into a
microwave-safe Bowl also two tablespoons
of the pumpkin puree one tablespoon of
sugar 1/4 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice
and then 1/4 a teaspoon of vanilla
extract covering it with some plastic
wrap and making sure to add a whole and
then I'm heating this up for about a
minute and a half I think I ended up
doing two minutes and then I am just
whisking it so it gets nice and frothy
and then you just pour this into your
cup also with 1/4 a cup of hot coffee
and a finish it off we just are adding
some whipped cream and then using some
of the pumpkin pie spice on the top and
that is it so tasty and I definitely
recommend making it lastly we are making
a pumpkin white hot chocolate this is
definitely my favorite drink it is
awesome so I'm using some milk some
pumpkin puree some cinnamon pumpkin pie
spice vanilla extract and also some
white chocolate so we're heating up one
and a half cups of whole milk 1/2 cup of
pumpkin puree 1/2 a teaspoon of pumpkin
pie spice and then 1/2 a teaspoon of
vanilla extract and then I'm just
whisking this until it is nice and
smooth and once it is heated up in
smooth I'm just adding in my 2 ounces of
white chocolate and then repeatedly just
mixing that up making sure it is nice
and smooth pouring it into my cup adding
some whipped cream and then also adding
a little bit of cinnamon and that's it
it's so so yummy it's awesome
