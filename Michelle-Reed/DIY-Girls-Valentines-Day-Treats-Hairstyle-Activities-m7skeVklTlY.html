Valentine's video with my friend rose
and today we're going to be doing kind
of like a DIY treats / hair tutorial
kiss you want to go out for kind of like
a girls night spa night kinda deal that
was like three different videos hahaha
so the hair and makeup part of this is
going me if you are going out or if you
do have a boyfriend and you go on a date
no for the makeup in this fall section
is going to be on roses channels so
click her face if you want to see it up
but her channel also be linked in the
downbar so you should definitely watch
that part after you watch this port and
like this video if you're single and you
still want have fun on Valentine's Day
because it's not just for couples it's
clearance so let's go ahead and get to
this video so for this lovely hair
tutorial that I'm doing today I'm using
my newbie three-in-one curling iron yes
three barrels come with one curling iron
which is great because you don't have to
switch around a dozen times depending on
if you feel wavy we're tight girls you
can do it everything what because you
have three sizes but today I decided to
use me 25 millimeter which is just kind
of like the medium sized one last night
I also make sure to apply my white
truffle serum yes truffles as in the
chocolate of truffles this stuff kind of
acts as a lot of different things you
can use it as a heat protectant in
anti-frizz serum which is what I use it
for or just something to make your hair
a little smoother I notice that my curls
are a lot softer when I use this because
i hate's like brittle gross burns hair I
have had people say that my hair look
shiny when I use this so I think it's a
great thing it smells like good boys
good smelling voice is what I meant and
let's just go ahead and get into the
hair tutorial so I'm starting off by
brushing my hair and using my alligator
clips to pinback different sections so i
just took my nume curling iron and
wrapped an inch piece around the barrel
and I didn't have to hold it very long
because this curling iron gets super hot
super fast and you get this super cute
little curls so I just did this for the
rest of my hair and I section my hair
off in about three
front sections stuff this curling iron
is also great because you don't have to
hairspray since the curls last all day
and even into the second day because I
love me some second day curls let me
tell you I then just applied the truffle
serum to the ends of my hair to give it
a little bit of shine so for the bow
Rose just took two pieces from the front
of my hair and then kind of tied them
together with a clear elastic but left a
loop in the last tie and separated it
and then pin down each section and took
a piece from the center and wrapped it
around to create a bow and it was super
cute and it lasted all day so I think
this is very cute for Valentine's Day I
understand that this curling iron is a
little bit expensive I get it I found a
few coupon codes for you guys the first
one is shell doll and it gives you 40
percent off the whole entire site and
also free shipping to the US the second
one is secret admirer and this gives you
forty nine dollars for one curling iron
and you also get a free pouch so
definitely use those I don't have them
linked down below if you want to go
check them out because saving money is
great if you guys know me you know i
love my coupons so i really hope that
helps you guys out so the first DIY that
we are doing is these little
heart-shaped rice krispie treats which
were super delicious and super easy to
make so all you need is some rice
krispies marshmallows butter white
chocolate and a heart shaped cookie
cutter we begin by melting three
tablespoons of butter and then adding in
a bag of large marshmallows and melting
it until they were all smooth and
together then we just added in these six
cups of the rice krispies and then
spread it all out onto a cookie sheet
and made sure it was nice and even then
we just cut out the hearts from the rice
krispies and melted the white chocolate
in the microwave I know mine says
marshmallow don't get marshmallow it was
not that good but these are definitely
be a lot better with white chocolate so
we just spin that onto the hearts added
some sprinkles and that was it
the next treat is this strawberry hot
cocoa which is super cute and tasty all
you're going to need is some chocolate
chips strawberry ice cream butter
whipped cream sugar and some sprinkles
so first we just melted some chocolate
chips in the microwave and then put the
rims of our glasses in here and it will
harden and will be super cute and tasty
then we just melted the 4 tablespoons of
butter the sugar and a pipe of
strawberry ice cream together until it
was a nice consistency and then you just
add in 4 cups of water to make more and
then pour them into your glasses and add
whipped cream if you're like me you can
add a ton and also add some sprinkles
and that's it for the super easy hot
cocoa strawberry goodness the last treat
we made were these strawberry cookies
and all you're gonna need is some
strawberry pudding mix sugar chocolate
chips baking soda salt vanilla and some
butter so the first step is to cream
together the butter and the sugar and
then add in your two eggs and your half
a teaspoon of vanilla and then mix it
all together then combine all of the dry
ingredients into a bowl mix it all up
together and then slowly add it to the
wet ingredients
after this i just added in some red food
coloring to make them pink and then
mixed in the chocolate chips and put
them on a cookie sheet with some
parchment paper and then cuts them in
the oven and then this is what happens
so they were so cute and tasty and I
definitely recommend making these
definitely go watch roses video which is
linked down below to get some kind of
ideas of what to do on Valentine's Day

spot things to make I'll see you guys in
