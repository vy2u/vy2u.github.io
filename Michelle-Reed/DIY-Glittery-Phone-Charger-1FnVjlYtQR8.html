make this glittery charger that I've got
lots of compliments on and yeah it's
really easy to make first you're going
to need some Mod Podge and any kind of
glitter i'm using this martha stewart
kind hairspray scotch tape a plate a
brush i'm just using a makeup brush and
of course a charger so first just take
your tape and then tape off any of the
kind of metal or iron I don't know what
it is side just so you don't get any
glue or glitter on them now take your
Mod Podge and just paint on a thin layer
or a thick layer doesn't really matter
just make sure it's very even so you
don't get too many clumps once you have
an even layer of Mod Podge just put on
your glitter I'm just going to sprinkle
it on i'm using this bronze color and
i'm just going to sprinkle it on with
the little sprinkle cap until it is
covered well
so then your charger should look like
this and then just let it dry for at
least 24 hours now you're gonna take
your hair spray and then sprayed the
glitter this is going to keep it on so
it doesn't rub off or anything or just
get your hands I'll glittery and then
again let that dry for 24 hours and then
your charger should be good to use I
know it might have some clumps in it
because I did it really quickly but if
you really try and focus you can get it
to me nice and thin in all the same
consistency</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
