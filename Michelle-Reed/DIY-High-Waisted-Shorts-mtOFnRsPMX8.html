make these super cute high waisted
shorts hi guys today I'm here with my
two friends this is Lauren and this is
rose and we're gonna be making these DIY
shorts they're like high-waisted the
high waisted sabrosa like lace and
fabric and make it look oh cool so yep
also i want to say Lord has her own
channel and she does covers of songs you
should check girl because she's awesome
police in the downbar or we can go into
it right now so for what you're gonna
need first you're going to need some
ugly high-waisted jeans ours are from
Goodwill I'm just a regular old pair of
scissors some lace trimmer just ribbon
the liquid stitch in fray check some
cute springy fabric and then just a
sharpie and some trustworthy friends
just kidding that was really cheesy okay
so first we're just gonna be marking
where we want our gene length to be so I
was having my friend Lauren help me and
then you just cut your jeans off just
like any other pair and Lauren was smart
and she folded her is over and cutters
so now we're just testing out what we
want to do getting those creative juices
flowing
so taking the liquid stitch Lauren just
put it on the lace and then put it
around her pockets I took the red polka
dot fabric and put it inside my pocket
just using the glue I pressing it down
and then like I said Lauren just lined
her pockets and I also did that as well
and it looked really cute also this glue
is permanent and it's basically like if
you cannot so you can just use ass glue
and it works fine so now taking a razor
blade I'm just cutting into the jeans
little strips and then using a fork yes
a fork I am just going to distress them
so just you know go away for cannot your
jeans and this is going to give it that
distressed look so Lauren did it on our
pockets and I did as well and then I
brought to show my friend rose but she
used polka dot on her pockets so yep
that's the end of this video and I hope
you guys enjoyed this and if you make
these shorts or any kind of shorts make
sure to post them on my instagram or
twitter and i'll see you guys my next
video bye
