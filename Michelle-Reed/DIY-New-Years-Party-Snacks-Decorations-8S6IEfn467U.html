doing a DIY New Year's party video so
basically I'm just going to be showing
you guys some very easy decorations to
make and some really tasty treats a
couple things before I start I want to
say one that if it looks like we're
drinking alcohol it's definitely Welch's
grape juice so do not freak out and - I
want to say thank you to my friends for
helping me out with this video because
you guys raw make sure to follow me on
Instagram and Twitter and maybe show me
a picture if you happen to try any of
these things out also like this video if
you've never actually had a New Year's
party without further ado let's just go
ahead and get into the video I do not
know what this is so first you're going
to need some wine bottles which I got at
a craft store some gold spray paint some
white tulle chopsticks
yes chopsticks and then some stencils
and black cardstock so first I'm just
cutting out my stencils which I found on
Google then I just taped the tencel's
onto some black cardstock and then cut
them out this way they are really neat
and they all look the same
then I rolled out my tool and cut out
little squares around the numbers this
way it's a lot easier to outline the
numbers in the tool using some hot glue
I just glued the tool on to the letters
and then cut them around as neat as I
could it's not going to be super neat
but it still really defines the letter
it makes it look a little more
professional to hold up the letters I
just glued together two chopsticks that
I had because I was too lazy to buy
something but they actually worked
pretty well then all you do is glue the
chopsticks to the back of the numbers
and they aren't the prettiest on the
back so you can cut out another number
and put it on the back but I just
decided not to so for this brave eight
make sure you put on some gloves and
then just go at it I would let it sit
for about two hours before you actually
touch them and use them now this next
part is totally optional but I just took
some of these black ribbons and hot glue
them to the top of the wine bottles I
just think it adds a little more New
Year's Eve feel to the bottles and it
overall looks pretty so this is what it
looks like at the end I think it's a
great centerpiece and these are also
super cute to take pictures with
for the next project all you're going to
need is some mason jars some floating
candles and some glitter which I just
chose this rose gold kind so you can
pour the water in first and then
sprinkle in the glitter but I think it's
a lot prettier if you put the glitter in
and then pour the water over it either
way it just looks really really pretty
and this is definitely my favorite
project I made then I just popped in the
candles and lit them and that is all but
these are so mesmerizing and I can't get
over how pretty they are now we have to
have some balloons for New Year's
festivities so I just used some confetti
and clear balloons and I put the
confetti in the balloon but I'm gonna be
honest this is really hard so you may
want to watch a TV show cuz it takes a
while then I just blew up my balloons
and as you can tell I'm not a fan of
blowing up balloons but once you're done
these are really fun to kind of pop at
midnight and just throw around so I love
balloons and I really like this project
so you see next we will be making
glitter ice cubes so all you need is
some ice cubes and some edible glitter
so about two days before just make some
ice cubes in your freezer and then take
the edible glitter and sprinkle it on to
the ice cubes it doesn't taste like
anything so you won't actually taste it
but they just look pretty then just put
them back in the freezer for a couple
hours so the glitter adheres to the ice
cubes and then if you pour some of your
drinks over top of it it looks really
really pretty for this food project
you're going to need some funfetti cake
mix some cool whip some yogurt and some
animal crackers so first I just started
off by making the funfetti cake mix so I
put in my eggs my oil my water and
whatnot and then I mix this up so there
were no lumps next I mixed in my yogurt
and my whipped cream and I will have the
exact recipe down below and of course
you know I had to sneak a lick after
mixing everything together you just
cover with some plastic wrap and put it
in the fridge for about four hours and
serve with some animal crackers and this
is a great dip
so the last thing we're making is some
punch so you're gonna need a punch bowl
some raspberry sorbet vanilla extract
scream raspberry juice and some
sparkling cranberry juice so I just
added in all of the liquids first and
the vanilla which again I will have the
exact measurements down below and then I
added in the sorbet and mixed everything
together this was actually my first time
in making this and it was so good and I
think all my friends seem to love it as
well so that is the end of this video I
really hope you guys enjoyed watching it
maybe leave me a comment down below and
tell me what you are most excited for
for 2015 I'll see you guys my next video
