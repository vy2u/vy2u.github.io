do-it-yourself pool party with your
friends kind of video so I'll be showing
you guys how to make some super yummy
treats a really cute swim coverup and
also these really cool like fairy lights
which would be great for night swimming
I found this with nice to critique
friends so thank you guys so much for
helping me out with this video is
officially summer for me and I'm about
to be making some super cool video so
you should definitely subscribe because
I know you're gonna tell yourself that
you're gonna do super awesome things in
this summer but let's just face it
you're just gonna binge watch youtube
videos so you might as well subscribe
right yes that is everything I have to
say so we're gonna go ahead and get into
this video no first we will be starting
off with this tie dye cover-up that i
have seen all over pinterest and it's
super easy and cute so all you're going
to need is an oversized white t-shirt
some thai thai i used red yellow and
blue but you can use whatever colors you
want and then some fabric scissors I'm
pinching the center of the shirt and
creating a swirl for the tie-dye effect
and then I'm going in with six rubber
bands and tying that around to secure
the little knot and then I'm going and
tie dying and I didn't really want to
mix the colors but they ended up mixing
so I would suggest not letting the mix
so they'd be pretty but yeah my just
happened to kind of be all the colors of
the rainbow but that's okay then you
just let the shirts it 48 hours after
the shirt has SAT for eight hours you
just wash it and I did mine on cold and
medium water level so to start the
cutting all you do is cut off the
sleeves as if you were making a muscle
tank then flip the shirt over and create
a racerback I just kind of drew a semi
circle and then use this as a pattern
for the other side so they were even
then I flipped the shirt over and cut
off the collar just where the scene was
that and then I flipped the shirt back
around and did a straight line about an
inch below the neckline and then I cut 3
equal strips and braided those
then I just so the three pieces together
but I wanted to sew it on a sewing
machine so I didn't actually feel myself
doing it and then I sewed it to the top
in the middle below the neckline and
then I sewed a little piece over to
cover up all the scenes and that's it
for the cover-up it's super cute and
really inexpensive to start off the
treats we are making some watermelon
kiwi popsicles for this you're going to
need some Kiwis some cubed watermelon
and then some sugar so we're starting
off by making a syrup by adding a cup of
water and then two tablespoons of sugar
and then letting the sugar dissolve and
then I'm putting in three cups of
watermelon into the blender until it's
blended completely I'd recommend using a
juicer though so it's not lumpy and then
I'm just putting this into the popsicle
molds about two-thirds but I went a
little bit overboard and after that sits
for an hour just cut your Kiwis up I'm
actually very bad at cutting Kiwis so no
judgment guy is no judgment then I'm
just blending those up again and adding
two tablespoons of the syrup and then
I'm putting about a third of the Kiwi
into the top and that is how you make
these popsicles and they're super yummy
and I suggest making them for the next
popsicles are making some yogurt
blueberry strawberry pops so you're
going to need some paper Dixie Cups some
yogurt I use vanilla yogurt some
blueberries and some strawberries so I'm
starting off by cutting the strawberries
and you want to create a little slit in
the middle of them so the popsicle stick
and fit in there so first you're going
to put in the yogurt and then the
blueberries and then a little bit more
yogurt and then the strawberry and then
the stick and then top it off with the
yogurt so I just did this for about ten
of the popsicles then I just let these
sit overnight and voila you have some
nice yummy treats
so the last food item we are making are
these super yummy banana and Nutella
sushi rolls so for this all you're going
to need is some Nutella some bananas and
then some wheat wraps I'm starting off
by coating the meat wrap with the
Nutella and doing it pretty generous
layer and then I'm putting the banana on
and kind of rolling it which is actually
very satisfying and I really liked
rolling them then I just cut them into
about two inch little sections may be
more an inch and yah that's it they are
so yummy and guys they're really good
for breakfast too lastly we are making
these glow up jars which are great for
night swimming or nine cool parties so
all you're going to need is some mason
jars some glow sticks and some glitter
it's all I'm doing is cutting the
glowstick and pouring out the glow stuff
but make sure you have non toxic glow
sticks um just to be safe and then I'm
just doing this with whatever colors I
like and then I'm adding the glitter and
shaking it all up and then you get this
really cool glow jars they're so easy
guys and they are super super pretty to
put outside that is everything that I
have to show you guys and I really hoped
