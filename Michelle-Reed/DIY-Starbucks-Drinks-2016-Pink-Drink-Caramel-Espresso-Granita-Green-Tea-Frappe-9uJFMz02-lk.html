Elizabeth here on YouTube and we're
doing a Super Bowl club she's doing DIYs
that you need to try for the summertime
and so shall we check out her video
it'll be linked down below and if you
happen to be from Kenzie's family she'll
be subscribed yet subscribe yeah I
upload on Sundays and Thursdays but in
this video I'm doing do-it-yourself
Starbucks drinks for summer which is
super fun and because I know Ken's and I
both really like starlit get so worried
Zig did so if you want to save some
money
definitely watch this video go ahead and
get into video so first we are starting
off with the pink drink from Starbucks
so first you're just going to need one
lemon some strawberries some coconut
milk mine is vanilla flavor but any
coconut milk works and then some kind of
berry tea so first I'm starting off by
just cutting up my strawberries and then
I also went ahead and cut my lemon in
half since we will be squeezing that
into the drink later after making my
berry tea I just let it sit in the
fridge to kind of cool for a little bit
and then I filled it up about halfway
and my Starbucks cup and add it in half
of a lemon and then some ice and my
strawberries and then I filled it to the
top with the coconut milk you can kind
of change up your proportions that this
is just how much tea to coconut milk I
wanted in mine and then I added more
strawberries and there you have the pink
drink it's so good and it tastes super
similar to the original one and now on
to the caramel expresso granita which if
you are a coffee lover you will love
like myself all you will need is some
strong coffee I didn't have espresso so
I just used cold brew coffee some
caramel sauce some vanilla some ice and
then just some cream so first I started
off by kind of blending up my ice and I
try to do this in a food processor added
some vanilla to sweet in it and then I
decided to take it to the blender
because it worked a little bit better so
then I'm just pouring that into my
Starbucks cup and then I added in my
cold brew coffee till about it was 3/4
full or so and then I added in my cream
and the caramel sauce you can put
however much you want to in there and
then I mixed it up and put my lid on and
there you have your caramel espresso
granita it is so yummy and lastly we
have the green tea frappuccino so all
you're going to need for this is some
matcha powder and I couldn't find pure
matcha powder so I'm using a green tea
latte form some whipped cream vanilla
extract and then some milk so basically
all I'm doing is mixing up my ice and my
matcha powder and I just put a couple of
tablespoons in there some vanilla and
some milk and then I'm blending this up
and then I just poured it into my
Starbucks cup and added my whipped cream
and that is it I know I don't have exact
measurements everything but if you want
to see just go down below and I will
have the exact measurements down below
so I really hope you guys enjoyed

making it and again make sure to go
