a video that I'm super stoked about
because it's going to be a Jew yourself
Starbucks drinks kind of video Starbucks
drinks are so expensive and honestly
like who has the money to go there
everyday in my five dollar tree because
I know I do know much I'm gonna be
showing you guys how to make an iced
chai tea latte a Java chip Frappuccino
and cookie crumble Frappuccino and the
new s'mores frappuccinos so super super
stoked to show you guys if you have a
Starbucks addiction like I do make sure

bad it is such a problem also if you
happen to try out any of these recipes
definitely tweet me a picture or tag me
in an Instagram photo because I love
seeing whenever you guys actually like
read great things because it shows that
these videos are maybe a little helpful
if you're not already subscribed
definitely subscribe right now because
I'd love to have you in my little family
and let's just go ahead and get into
this video again with appointing the
show why do you always point out so the
first string we are making is an iced
chai tea latte and it's super easy and
super tasty so all you're going to need
is some chai tea some milk and some
sweetener and I chose to use sweetened
low
so I started off by just making my chai
tea and I'd actually recommend making
this maybe a couple hours before and
letting it cool off so it doesn't melt
the ice and then I just added in my
sweetener and then once you pour it over
the ice just add some milk and that's
literally it it's so tasty and so good
for the summer because it's nice and
cool instead of hot
you got home
now this next drink we are making is a
Java chip Frappuccino and it is so yummy
let me tell you for the strength you're
going to need some Hershey's syrup mini
chocolate chips whipped cream ice and
some cooled down coffee and yes there is
coffee in here so I just added in my ice
you can kind of put however much you
want and then I added a teaspoon of
Hershey's syrup then I added the
chocolate chips and you can put however
much you want and then I added my cup of
coffee and blended this all together in
a blender why it's not the best so it
didn't blend too well but you get the
picture
then I poured it into a cup and of
course I had to spill it that's my life
and then I added some whipped cream and
some Hershey's syrup and you are set and
good to go
the second property no we are making is
the new s'mores Frappuccino for this
recipe you're going to need some graham
crackers some milk some white sugar some
whipped cream some marshmallow topping -
Smuckers some cocoa and again some cold
coffee so I'm adding in 3/4 a cup of ice
1/2 cup of milk and then 3 tablespoons
of the marshmallow 2d blender and then
about a cup of coffee I'm also adding
and then lastly I'm just doing the brown
sugar and the white sugar and then
blending everything all together
after adding the Frappuccino to your cup
you can add some marshmallow and also
some crushed graham crackers to kind of
finish off the Frappuccino I also added
some chocolate syrup because I love me
some chocolate and this last Frappuccino
is my favorite mocha cookie crumble so
for this recipe you're going to need
some mini chocolate chips some white
sugar some coffee creamer some Hershey's
syrup some whipped cream some brown
sugar and some coffee and some crushed
cookies and I just crush some Oreos in a
food processor so I'm adding a cup of
strong coffee to my mixture some coffee
creamer about 1/4 of a cup and then my
white sugar and then my brown sugar each
1/2 a teaspoon and then 1 tablespoon of
chocolate syrup and then again just some
mini chocolate chips to your liking then
just the 3 crushed cookies and some ice
and then again you just blend it all
together
I just added some whipped cream to the
top and took some of the extra cookie
crumbs and I put that on the top to
garnish and that's it for the
Frappuccino
so like always I really hoped you guys
