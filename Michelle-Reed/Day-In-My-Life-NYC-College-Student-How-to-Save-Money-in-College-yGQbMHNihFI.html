morning but today's video is really
exciting cause I've never done something
like this this is gonna be another day
in my life vlog just a normal college
vlog because you guys really like these
but something about me lately that I've
been really into is saving money and
just being really conscious about making
small little changes in my life to save
money I feel like YouTube really ups how
cool consumerism is and how cool like
spending money and buying things is but
I feel like no one really talks about
like how saving money and like being
financially stable it's actually really
cool and so in today's video I'm gonna
show you guys my favorite tips that I
incorporate throughout my entire day
that sort of thing you need a is for
sponsoring this video I've worked with
them before and I absolutely love them
let's just go ahead and get right
so for breakfast I would definitely
recommend eating at home for breakfast
it is so easy to make quick breakfast
one of my favorites is overnight oats
overnight oats are so easy literally all
you need your oats all my milk and like
maybe a banana if you want to get fancy
they're so easy and so cheap I think
oats are probably like three dollars for
a jar almond milks probably like maybe
four dollars so I just take some of
these Trader Joe's quick cook steel cut
oats I just take maybe like half a cup
of these mix it with a little bit of
almond milk overnight in a little
container with a lid and then you wake
up with like this really nice
consistency I added a little bit to all
my mouth last night I was really tired
you can add anything you want in the
morning I usually like to add coconut
chips some agave and also a banana which
is a super cheap fruit and there you
have a super easy breakfast which
literally takes like five minutes
I would also recommend going to the
farmers market it's so much cheaper I
feel like before I went to the farmers
market I had this idea that like farmers
markets are more expensive everything's
organic and like locally grown so I just
got these five really nice Honey Crisp
apples and these are like seven dollars
when normally they'd be like nine
dollars for four of them at a grocery
store and so definitely check out your
farmers market if you're trying to get
like good cheap fruit that tastes good
so basically I've just been twerking on
YouTube stuff for a little bit I just
posted a video I'm trying to be better
at being more consistent and calling I
just posted that which feels really
really good I now have a ton of homework
to do it just feels so good outside it's
like 50 degrees I just am loving like
spending alone time in the apartment
it's just so important for me really
appreciative it's like while I have a
ton of stuff to get done and I honestly
feel really behind on life
I'm just really content and I'm just
like happy to be where I'm at and it
feels really really good definitely
ready for some coffee
I said that I would have is not to go
out and buy a coffee would actually make
it at home which is really hard for me
because I love iced coffees maybe just
cut back like a couple times a week I
really like the organic coffee Code Java
love single serve coffee sustainable
ones it's like you're into that kind of
stuff so I just had like a free second
to sit down and it's getting really cold
here in New York and I always
procrastinate on or during winter
clothes and so I think I might go ahead
and try to order a couple of things just
cuz they're like necessities I'd also
like to note that this is not a hickey
is to subscribe I'm also in the basement
so any time I have to buy anything
online I always use Yoona days and if
you were a college student you should
definitely take advantage of them
basically all you do is sign up with
your student email through your college
and you're immediately hooked up on the
website you can use the app on your
phone or you can use it on your computer
I usually use it on my computer just
because I don't really like shopping on
my phone a spot of all your browsing all
your favorite fashion stores you can
actually get discount codes for all
three favorite brands like Urban
Outfitters princess Polly I know it's
super popular right now and I love them
Nasty Gal rag-and-bone these are brands
that are super duper cool and you can
get like 15 to 20 percent off on all of
these brands just by going through Yoona
days like this doesn't cost any money
the website is really easy to navigate
onto so you literally just go on it and
you will just click when you want to
apply the discount and actually get it
and then you can use it on all your
favorite websites there are so many
brands it's not just like random brands
that no one's heard of and also if you
have a friend who loves online shopping
you can refer them and you immediately
have five dollars off it is such a great
way to save money
Unity's also has a ton of giveaways on
their website so if you actually want
free stuff you can totally do that as
well so while I don't online chop off
that much I really like to use unities
when I do because I save mine
being college like money's tight so I'll
have the link down below if you want to
sign up and start saving yourself you
should definitely do it I've been using
this for about like two years that I've
been in college literally save money by
doing absolutely nothing this isn't like
a gimmick or anything I just think it's
really cool and another thing that I
also encourage is actually checking out
free resources so one thing that I love
to do is read but like buying books all
the time can be really expensive and so
we actually have like this whole like
bookshelf down in our basement I don't
really think anyone uses but you can
just like take books and read them I
will just come down here and pick up a
book there honestly there's so many
books down here and they're just so nice
to go through and not like actually have
to go through a library or anything so
it's kind of noisy out here about
another tip I would have is instead of
going to a coffee shop to study try
finding a free spot so whether that be a
public park or for me the roof of my
apartment building I really really like
so while I'm getting ready right here I
don't want to talk about why I have
shifted to more of a saving money kind
of mindset so obviously like buying
stuff going out to eat like that kind of
stuff is fun naturally that's something
that like you're going to want to do
especially in college and a lot of the
times I feel like you've bond with
people are like over food or like going
shopping with people the more I grow up
the more I realized that like ultimately
being happy comes from things that are
not material buying things like
instantly for instant gratification is
that fulfilling I think for me one of
the biggest parts of saving money comes
from the fact that there are a lot of
things later in life that like I really
want to do I think a good living space
is really important to me because doing
YouTube and stuff you know where you
live is kind of like your office it's
not the place that you want to be able
to work in and grow in and just feel
comfortable in and that like takes
having money saved up to have a place
that you really like I also know that
within like the next like five to ten
years I want to get married and I want
to have the kind of wedding that like
I've always wanted and while that may
seem like stupid that's like something
that I want not having to live paycheck
to paycheck it's also something that's
really valuable which also means like
you have to have money save and also if
there are things in your life that are
kind of stupid that you don't
necessarily eat but you do like to spend
money on like prioritize those and your
budget like two things that I really
like that I honestly don't want to cut
back on or like having fresh flowers in
my part literally like in my bathroom
right now like buying nice coffee and
those are two things I don't need like
those are not necessities but I still
feel like to some degree they make my
life nicer having those two things so
I'm gonna cut out other areas of my life
that aren't necessary so I'm not gonna
go out to eat that much with like my
friends so I cut back in those areas so
I can do the things that I want to do
it's all about just if you put something
into your life you got to cut something
out that's how you balance aids and
especially how you balance money I'm
like obviously on YouTube I do make
money and I have prioritize like saving
that money because I want to do the
things that like matter to me move so
that's my rant I'm gonna go ahead and
keep getting ready
so just finish class and I got ready cuz
I'm gonna go hang out at the park with
my boyfriend that's another tip I would
have for you guys instead of like eating
out or doing something like that just go
somewhere that you can just like walk
around and talk but I definitely always
enjoy like our dates in the park as
opposed to like actually going somewhere
more I don't know they just seem a lot
more special and so I'm about to go head
there hopefully catch the sunset if I'm
not too late that's what I'm hoping
so I'm gonna end up this vlog with a
verse and just kind of a little message
this is something that I want to start
adding into my videos if you're feeling
anxiety of you're feeling fear this is
my favorite verse it literally got me
through college last year every morning
I kid you not I would read this verse to
myself Psalm 34 for I sought the Lord
and he answered me and he delivered me
from all my fears those who look to him
are radiant and their faces shall never
be ashamed for me that verse just brings
me so much peace I hope you guys enjoyed
this video if you want to check out
Yoona days make sure to go down below
and download it I really love you guys
and if you like vlogs also let me know
because I would love to just continue
doing these if you guys enjoy them I
love you guys and I'll see you as my
next video five minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
