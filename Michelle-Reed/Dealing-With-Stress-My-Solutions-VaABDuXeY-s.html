bohemian waves and it kind of just looks
I've ever got to curl the ends of my
hair you win some you lose some hello my
friends today I am here to do an advice
video on dealing with stress because I
know this time of year is the worst like
you have so many tests you're playing
for colleges you're trying to get into
colleges things can just get really
chaotic in this end of the school year
time so I decided that this would be
very appropriate to do but in this video
I'm going to talk about how to kind of
subdue it lessen the pain if you know
what I mean because I understand that
it's gonna happen my first point is to
learn how to say no because I feel like
the main reason why we get stress is we
put so much on ourselves in today's
society were really pressured to do
every single activity that we can you
know be the best in academics be the
best of our sports and our jobs just all
areas of life like this sense of
perfection is really craved I guess
we're lack of a better word up and so I
think you do have to learn how to say no
to think so if you have a ton of stuff
to do one died in your friends are like
hey let's hang out you know maybe think
is this going to lead to me staying up
till two and being extremely stressed
out it is super hard to say no and I
know that because I love to help others
out but sometimes I just can't because I
have to deal with my own personal
problems and you know sometimes you
don't have the time to deal with other
people's my second point and probably
the most important i would say is to
manage your time wisely good time
management skills are so valuable but
they are so hard to cultivate and i can
tell you that up front because i'm not
the best at it I actually spend about an
hour getting ready today instead of
reading my history books so it is hard
to manage your time wisely what I like
to do personally is make a list of
everything I have to do in importance so
let's say I have a paper due that night
I'm going to do that first and maybe I
have a test in a couple days I'm going
to study for that next just think about
the activities that are more important
than the other so if you haven't worked
out in a week in you're obsessed with
working out and go work out and do that
activity like your homework can wait a
little bit for that that will also
energize you so just manage your time
wisely and know what you can do what you
can't do now positivity is really hard
for me because I would consider myself a
pessimistic person unfortunately like I
don't like to admit that but it's true
things are so much harder to get done
whenever you're being negative about it
nothing is going to happen if you just
sit on your bed and you're playing about
everything you have to do like yes it
sucks I will tell you it sucks I feel
you but you just got to get it done
Danielle on YouTube who I love her video
she actually just uploaded a video on
positivity and I loved it so I will link
it right here or in the down bar
somewhere so i definitely recommend
watching that up for this video if you
need some help I'll positivity the
fourth topic i have is planning your day
out because i think it's so important to
have a game plan for every day i love
being spontaneous but there are some
days where you got to know what you're
going to do because you have so much
stuff to do i personally wake up about
15 minutes earlier than I necessarily
could just because I like to plan out my
day and kind of get ready for it and
prepare because life is hard and you got
to prepare for the battlefield because
life is no I but seriously just wake up
a little bit earlier I know let me kill
some of you guys I'm a morning person so
it's not too tough for me but just plain
your day out and know what you're going
to do what you gotta do give yourself
some time to yourself to just kind of
relax and prepare
the next tip I actually really like it
it's to give yourself some time to
yourself to do your own activities in
your own things that make you happy you
are going to go insane if you only do
homework for like 12 hours straight or
practice for your volleyball beats for
12 hours straight this is actually
something for me that I love to do
filming is such a big stress reliever
for me because first of all I get to
talk to you guys which I love but also
reading I really like to do and i also
just love watching youtube videos so
find something that makes you happy and
give yourself time to do that I last tip
we just know that stress passes I feel
like a lot of times in life whenever
we're going through things it feels like
it's going to be there forever in
there's this sense we feel like this
stress is eternal that's never going to
end but it will because everything
passes and I promise this shell to pass
this too shall pass and I promise this
to show and I promise this too shall
pass and things will go on like it's
going to go on I know I can be kind of
dramatic about things I'm like oh my
gosh I'm never going to get to do what I
want to do I'm so stressed out but you
will I promise things go on life goes on
it things will get better so those are
pretty much all the things that I have
to tell you guys I really hope this
enjoyed you this is why you do not drink
coffee 10 minutes before filming a video
i literally can't speak stress is normal
on everybody's going through it but I
think we can all work together to defeat
it as well as we can't let me know any
of your tips that you guys have and give
this video a like if you got any advice
from it and i'll see you guys next video
bye
I'd never make a change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
