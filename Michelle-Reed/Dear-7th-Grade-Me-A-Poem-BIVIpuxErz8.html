get the more we care and the more we
fret about how others perceive us and
see us but not how we ourselves see
ourselves I never was the most outgoing
person and as I grew up my seclusion
worsen I always chose to stay in and
read which label Mia is quite an odd
breed as others were attending social
gatherings staying up till 3:00 singing
and laughing I was losing myself in all
these visions about projects and my
future ambitions I always thought this
wasn't a weakness that my creative mind
was seen as uniqueness but that
perception of myself was soon changed
when I was called a nerd and seen a
strange 7th grade me thought this was a
tragedy as I overreacted and cried in
agony but oh how I wish I could go back
in claim that I was simply intelligent
which was not a shame we live in a world
dominated by entertainment where
knowledge and wisdom are put in
containment what one writes or what one
reads has no value if it's not on a
screen we can't endure a 10-minute
conversation without our phones buzzing
and vibration and no what a shame it
would be if we left that phone as an
absentee our talks become of surface
level topics where the options of a
conversation seemed to be microscopic we
can't even involve ourselves in debates
due to fear of offending our mates
I thank God every day that 7th grade me
refused to change I hope to never live
in a place where scholars and inventors
are seen as a disgrace on lines are such
beautiful contraptions having the
ability to form endless actions nothing
compares to that feeling of pride when
you solve an equation or create your own
rhyme now that I'm older and slightly
wiser I've given up the childish desire
of wanting to fit in with these
so-called friends when I have something
far more valuable a brain and a lens
