grab a seat and enjoy I was born on July
1st 1998 in a small home in Chicago I
had four other siblings who I loved lots
I had Jordan Lindsey Derek and Jamie so
I guess you could say we had a pretty
big family
um out of my whole family I was always
called the baby since I was a youngest
and parently the most spoiled even
before I could talk I'd cry constantly
one time my mom's friend even said I was
just crying because I couldn't speak yet
um ever since I was a child I've always
been a small little ball of energy
sometimes my mom would take me to the
grocery with her and all I would do was
dance around and sing jesus loves you to
all the customers because you know I
felt too led to do so but I'm an ally so
spreading the word so yeah I even
remember telling some workers to get a
move on while they were back in
groceries so you know I had my moments
while I was never really a prankster or
anything I remember one time my sister
Jamie and I fed snails and rocks to my
dog Mandy so I guess you could say we
were in a wee little bit of trouble from
my mom second grade I met one of my best
friends Chandler she was really really
sweet and we basically did everything
together as kids or as far as I could
remember I was never really smart as a
good to tell you the truth since I was a
chatterbox I never ever focused on work
I was definitely more concerned on
meeting new friends and having a social
life than getting good grades I even
remember getting a 50 on my first book
report which was a very big
embarrassment I remember when I was
little I would go to my mom's room and
tell her I had stomachache so I wouldn't
have to go to school although this never
really works but you know times have not
changed I still honestly do not like
school that much also as a kid I was
more of a homebody and I absolutely
hated going anywhere outside of my home
if I ever went to any camps I'd get
homesick and lay awake at night crying
on the inside
because I miss my mom and my family and
whatnot my biggest injury happened when
I was seven I actually broke my leg
while jumping on a trampoline although
it didn't really bother me because I got
a cast and then once it was pink I
became a lot happier not so sad I was
about nine my oldest brother Derek was
leaving for college in New York and I'd
always had a personal bond with him and
I was really close to him so I remember
just laying awake at night crying
because I missed him so much although
this also led to many trips to visit him
which inspired my love for New York City
and just my love for the city and I
still love New York City as my favorite
place in the world to this day also at
the age of nine I displayed my public
display of affection towards God and I
was baptized although this was a super
big day I was super nervous knowing that
all 1,000 eyes in the church were zeroed
in on me that was honestly again a very
big day for me and I think I got the
special plates on that one I also began
making videos at this time and all I
really remember is sitting in the corner
of my room talking as quite as a mouse
so nobody in my house could hear me I
was just a tad bit awkward sometimes my
siblings would show my videos to my
family and I think I was so mortified I
absolutely hated it um I just remember
getting tons of crap for it as a kid and
I literally would just like want to cry
but you know I continued it on
thankfully you know school was probably
the worst time in my life I remember in
seventh grade I sat on gum and it was
the most embarrassing moment of my whole
entire life don't want to go back to the
day you don't really have a whole lot of
friends but I had just a few close ones
I guess my chatterbox days of elementary
school quickly changed and it became a
lot more independent it wasn't until my
freshman year of high school when things
really started to change I guess you
could say
on the day of my drill team tryouts my
mom was actually hit by a car and you
know my priorities quickly changed but I
still went through with it and I tried
out for my drill team it was really
nerve-wracking but he ended up making it
in the end in spite of everything and I
still remember visiting my mom at the
hospital that night and I swear nothing
can take away the memory of seeing her
face when I told her that I had made the
team it was definitely a really good
moment in my life through this dance
team I met five of my best friends Jenny
McCall Sierra Caitlin and Megan and
they've honestly helped me just I guess
let loose and be a lot more crazy in
high school
I also was contacted by an awesome
company called stylehaul to become
partner and this was such a big
milestone in my youtube career and I'm
so thankful to have them with me
YouTube has honestly become my favorite
hobby and job that I've ever had I'm
currently living by Jeremiah 29:11 which
states I know the plans I have for you
plans to prosper you and give you hope
in a future you know leaving things in
God's hands is definitely pretty tough
but it's also reassuring and it really
helps my life so thank you all so much
for watching my draw my life video hope
you enjoyed and see you guys my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
