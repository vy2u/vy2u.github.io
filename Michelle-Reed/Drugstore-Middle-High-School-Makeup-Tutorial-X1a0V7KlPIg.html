to school new makeup show are you really
have about fifty dollars with the high
shine maybe maybe spending fifty dollars
on eyeshadow is a little crazy
that's more like it
hi friends today I'm going to be doing a
back to school makeup tutorial featuring
both a middle school makeup tutorial and
a high school makeup tutorial if you're
anything like me you probably don't have
a whole lot of money to spend on high
end makeup so I decided that doing a
tracks or version would be very very
helpful for you guys also i will be
starting off with the middle school look
so if you are in high school make sure
to go to this time to skip to the high
school i really really hope you guys
enjoy this so i just go ahead and get
into it so first we are going to start
off with the middle school makeup
tutorial which is very minimal and
natural so we're going to start off with
the revlon photoready concealer to
conceal any spots or under eye circles
that you may have
then we've got to set it with the Rimmel
stay matte powder to ensure that our
makeup stays on throughout the whole day
at school then I'm taking the decisions
formula happy blush which I love because
it's super glowy and it gives a very
youthful glow to your skin then taking
this cream shadow from Maybelline and
barely branded I'm applying this under
my brows into my eyelids we're going to
be using one of my favorite neutral
palettes and it is the NYX love in Paris
Khaled's I'm taking the kind of
champagne color and applying this to my
lid and then using the chocolatey brown
color in my crease and then we're going
to finish off the eyeshadow by
highlighting our inner corners and under
our brows then I'm just curling my
eyelashes and applying my rocket mascara
which you guys know I love
her lips were going to do something very
natural this is the elf jumbo lip gloss
stick and it's kind of a coral peach
color and we're just going to apply this
to our lips and yeah that's it for the
very natural simple middle school makeup
tutorial so now we are on to the high
school makeup tutorial and I don't know
about you guys but when I went into high
school my skin started to break out a
little bit more so I'm going to be using
my covergirl whipped cream foundation up
just to kind of cover up any acne or
spots that I may have more than a
concealer can then i'm taking my revlon
photoready concealer and i'm applying
this mainly just under my eyes to my
dark circles and then we are setting
everything with the Rimmel stay matte
powder and then we are going to use the
Physicians Formula happy blush to give
our skin a very pretty youthful glow now
my rails need some work so i'm using my
elf eyebrow kit to fill in my brows
where I need it then taking the NYX
eyeshadow pencil and yogurts I'm
applying this as my base for my
eyeshadows and it's a very nice bronzy
gold color then taking a Knicks love in
Paris palette i'm using the gold color
all over my lid then taking this kind of
bronzy brown color I'm applying this to
my crease and then we've got to
highlight under the brow into the inner
corner with this kind of creamy vanilla
shade then I'm lining my eyes with my
elf gel eyeliner which I can't do on
camera because I have to focus at my
mere and it takes me like 10 minutes and
as you can see it kind of turned out
terrible so I'm sorry but I'm just going
to curl my eyelashes and apply my rocket
mascara
infer lips were using this covergirl lip
gloss balm it's kind of a pinky shimmery
shade it's really nice works great as
they lip balm with a little bit of color
at the end of this back to school makeup
tutorial I really hope you guys enjoyed
