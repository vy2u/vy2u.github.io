video because I was actually blogging
and I asked you guys if you would like
to see kind of a college workout routine
video with really easy at home workouts
not in terms of like these workouts are
easy but like they're easy to do if
you're on a time crunch you don't have
time to go to the gym these are really
really good basically I show you guys my
favorite cardio workouts I show you guys
my favorite ab workout my favorite
full-body if you don't want to like run
or something I papercut workout my
favorite arm workout and I also include
my favorites down link down below if you
really like them you should stick around
and subscribe before I start this video
I want to talk about my favorite current
leggings brand I Blahniks reached out to
me and asked if I wanted to try some of
their limbs and possibly feature this
video if I really liked them if you
don't know what fabletics is it's
basically a really really cute workout
brand it was founded by Kate Hudson I
don't know about you guys but whenever
I'd really feel confident my workout
clothes and they're like bright and fun
I just feel excited to workout even if I
am working out at home so I really like
these because I only usually wear black
leggings but whatever one on top Linux I
was like these are so cute and I'm gonna
get some fun leggings I've let Excel so
has their VIP membership all you do is
start out by taking a quiz that kind of
shows what your style is just so fab
Lennox knows what products to recommend
and then each month from the first to
the fifth they will send you a
notification to let you know that you
should go on and shop their pics you
don't like anything yours not intuitive
that month you can skip the month and
you won't be charged for you know shop
it or you skip on the sixth month you
will be charged for the $50 for the
membership credit however if you want to
use one of my own deals you can get two
pairs of leggings for $24 whenever you
sign up so I'll have the link down below
if you want to check them out I worked
out in the pink pair last night and oh
my gosh they were so so good
there's squat proof first one that I
have are these marble pairs and I got
all of these and a size extra small with
the long length because I do have kind
of longer legs
I really don't wear anything else
besides high waisted leggings because
they just suck everything in I thought
this pair which I think is so nice for
Easter it is like a purple orange and
green
uhare again it's just the I wasted extra
small long ones there I think is my
favorite it is just like a classic
bubblegum pink color this is so cute and
then on the side it actually has like a
strip of lining to where you can like
see your legs which I think it's just
like a nice little detail playing black
pair because you know some days you're
just feeling like wearing all black to
the gym because sometimes it's the most
flattering if you're looking for some
new workout gear I definitely recommend
fabletics let's just go ahead and get
right into the easy college workouts so
if I'm feeling cardio that day I always
just like to go for a good run of course
I found this back home so there are
houses but I'm in New York City so there
actually aren't houses but I also like
to run the stairs in my building which
is a really easy cardio workout and I
also want to mention that these next
workouts I actually found online on
YouTube so they're just variations of my
favorites but I'll have them linked down
below if you want more extensive ones so
for this cardio workout I just start off
with jumping jacks and then these squat
jumps and this takes about 45 minutes
total and then I just do my mountain
climbers kind of trying to do them a
little bit faster also these butt kicks
and then the side plank pulses and I
usually just use like a 5 pound weight
and I'll kind of just go down while
holding that and then the next workout I
like to do are the plank pull through so
you just kind of reach over with the
weight these are really good for your
obliques and I also have really weak
arms so you'll probably notice that from
this video I also like to do some jump
lunges which you do have to be careful I
know my forms not perfect there and then
I'm just doing push ups and I'm on my
knees because again I have real weak
arms and then I like to do these things
where you kind of just push the weights
up and then touch your toes again I used
5 pound weights and then I called these
tea lifts where you just kind of go up
until you're horizontally straight and
then these shoulder pulses and then also
just your standard bicep curl and then
these I like to lift my leg just to kind
of work on balance and then also do tea
lifts at the same time and then I also
like to do leg extensions with a little
bit of a pull this is really good for
your abs but you're also working your
arms at the same time and then for
squats I like to do these ones where you
just kind of like pulse and bring your
knees together and I like to do them on
my toes because they actually like hurt
more
look so funny with guys they really hurt
your thighs and then a nice Valerie in a
squat on my toes as well and then I like
to do a little bit of a first position
squat and then a first position pulse
where you just bring your knees together
again and then this ballerina Burpee you
just kind of do like a ballerina jump
and then go down and touch down like a
burpee like you would with a normal one
and then I just do these kick lunges or
you just kind of kick these are so fun
they're really fun to get like
aggression out if you're mad I would
definitely recommend some kick lunges
and then I like to do a leg pulse where
you just kind of lift your leg pulls up
and down and then Valerie Anna kicks
these really hurt your butt but as you
can tell they're a little bit hard to
kind of keep your balance and then I
just like to pulse with them and then
switch to the other leg and go back and
forth obviously my form is not perfect
on these but I'm working on it
and then I like to do just some weighted
squats like so and then some squat
pulses on my toes and then I do these
knee tap planks where you just go down
touch your knees to the ground super
easy and then these hips thrusts which
looks so funny if you do these at the
gym but they really hurt your butt if
you keep doing them for a while and then
also shoulder and hip tap so you kind of
touch your shoulders and then you touch
your hips while planking of course this
really works your abs and then grabbing
my weights again I like to do weighted
donkey kicks which are good for your
butt and again my form was a little
slacking here you really notice that
whenever you watch videos guys and then
these butt moves which I think are
really funny I saw these in a video
linked down below but they really hurt
your butt you like circle your knee and
then you move it up and down and then
you go straight but if you do like these
really small little movements they
really kind of like work up to hurt your
booty after a while and then I like to
do like extension pulses again this is
for your butt and then I just kind of
like to lift my leg up and down to
really work that area and then I also
like to grab my weights again and I just
do a weighted sit-up where I go down and
I touch my toes and then I like to do
these leg extended situps these ones are
really hard and challenging but they're
really good for you and then I just do
these crossovers for my lower abs
and then just a traditional sit up with
the weights and trying to add weights
and everything because like I said my
arms are very weak and then I like to do
Russian twists and then that's it you're
finished for the cardio workout for my
but I just like to do these donkey kicks
flexed first I like to do everything on
one leg first and then I just kind of
pulse it and then I do a full extended
kick and then I do these hammy curls do
you think look real funny but you
basically just like pull in and out like
you're curling and then I like to do
pointed kicks at the end and then I
switch over do it on the other side this
is actually a block a lot easy does work
if you do it especially if you do it
like twice in a row it really hurts your
booty so I'll have it linked down below
if you want to watch it like extensively
to where it's not shortened like I did
right here so then I'm moving on over to
ABS this is my classic ab workout I love
it again I'll have this link down below
I like to start off with doing just some
bicycles and then I do some leg
extensions and this definitely works
your lower abs if you're in that area
and then I like to do these leg grabs
which is basically just a single leg
drop but whenever I kind of touch my
legs it adds a little bit of an element
to it
these I think are hard like jackknives
or something like that but basically you
just come in to your knees and then I
like to do bicycles again and then we
move on over to the cross plank which is
basically where you kind of like bring
your knee to the other side really works
your obliques and then do some mountain
climbers and then I like to do just a 30
second plank and then a side plank pulse
again this really works your obliques
and then I move back down into a plank
position and you kind of do a twist and
this also works your obliques but also
like your middle core as well and then
candlesticks I love these I think these
really work as well and I'm sorry my
shirt is coming up in all of these I
don't really realize it was coming up
that much then I like to do some leg
grabs where again it's just kind of like
a single leg drop clasp over is again a
leg extension again this time I decide
to put my arms up but I see you tell if
that hurt and so put them right back
down and then I like to do a reverse
crunch this really works those lower abs
and then I just do a plank for about 30
seconds and then another plank twist and
that is it for the ab workout I love
this I've been doing it for a while and
I've definitely noticed results so love
it
forearms I'm not putting text in for
this because I don't know like what
these are workouts are called but as you
can tell this is kind of like how they
are I basically do each of these for
about 15 to 20 reps and again this is an
exit video that I love so I'll have it
linked down below if you want to watch
it but really like these workouts I kind
of interchange between using five pound
weights but also 10 pound weight so it
just kind of depends on whatever I'm
feeling whatever my strength is usually
it's five because your girl is weak but
we are building muscle that's the whole
point of working out
finishing off with this crab move and
that is it for the arm workout and I
don't know all of these at once I
usually pick a day I just want to make
that clear so hope you guys enjoyed this
video I hope it gave you guys some tips
on what you can do at home to work out
because working out what's important and
just because you're on a time crunch it
doesn't mean that you have to skip a
workout as always if you're new
definitely make sure to subscribe to my
channel you can follow me on Instagram
if you want to keep up with me and then
on my vlog channel which is Michelle out
of your shell if you're super interested
I love you guys and I'll see you guys in
