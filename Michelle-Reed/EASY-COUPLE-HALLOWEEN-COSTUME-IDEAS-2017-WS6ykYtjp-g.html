exciting because it is going to be my
first-ever actual Halloween video it
couples Halloween outfit ideas video and
we try to make things that were kind of
easier to put together and so these
aren't like exactly like the people or
anything but it's stuff that you could
just like go into your closet and kind
of pick out the stuff and use it so for
costumes we did full house we did Jesse
and Rebecca Bonnie and Clyde we did
Madame Ann Don Draper and Betty Draper
it also did the cute little old couple
from up so those are the four outfits we
did we kind of trying to pick different
people so these aren't like trendy or
anything special things to eat in for
helping me out with this video and being
in it I really really appreciate it if
you want to see more of the pictures
that we took along this video make sure
to follow us on Instagram
I'll have them both linked down below I
love you guys and let's just go ahead
and get right into the video
so in this first outfit Eden and I
decided to do Jesse and Rebecca from
full house and this one was really cute
because it was actually pretty easy but
I still think it's like cute with the
90s vibe so we both just wore like some
light wash jeans mine were high-waisted
I got them from a thrift store they're
like eight dollars just with the tank
top and a little sweater which I also
thrifted for like eight dollars with
some high tops and a scrunchie and then
Aidan just wore like an oversized
flannel and some new balances and it was
really cute and simple but definitely
like probably my favorite outfit out of
all of these I really really like this
one
so Aidan and I both really like madmen
so we thought that we would do dawn and
Betty Draper which this outfit was also
really cute it was pretty simple my
dress I tried to thrift one I couldn't
find anything that really fits so I
ordered this one from Amazon is like 20
bucks and it actually fits them all the
only thing is I had to pin like the tops
is a little big but then Aiden just wore
like a nice suit jacket and a tie in an
undershirt and then also just some
loafers and it was really easy if you
throw on a red lipstick it kind of gives
it away too but it's super classy if
you're into Mad Men or the 60s and
whatnot this outfit is actually the old
couple from up I love this movie and the
soundtrack is like my absolute favorite
and so we decided to do this one
basically I just found this plaid yellow
dress on Amazon it was less than 20
dollars but it actually fit really well
and I think I'm gonna wear it again
because I think it's really cute with
some sandals and then Aiden was wearing
these really goofy glasses we got them
from a thrift store and they were like a
dollar I just think they're really funny
and then his shirt is just like a yellow
shirt that he thrift it as well but this
is really easy but really cute and I
just really liked this movie and so I
thought this one was fun and kind of
different and this last one is just the
kind of old-school style
bonnie-and-clyde which I love this one
as well I think it's so cute but
basically we went off this picture cuz I
know there are a lot of different Bonnie
and Clyde adaptations or whatever but I
just were shirt that I already had with
the thrifted scarf in this really long
thrifted skirt which I think I'm gonna
shorten so I can wear again with the
beret and some heels and then Eden just
kind of wore like again just a nice
dress shirt and a nice like suit jacket
with some khakis and then he also had a
hat which we bought for him to wear but
it was totally a girl hat and so he
didn't actually wear it he just held it
which I thought was funny but
so that's the end of this video I hope
