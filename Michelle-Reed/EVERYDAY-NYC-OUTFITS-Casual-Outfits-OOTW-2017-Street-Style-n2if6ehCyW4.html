friends in today's video I am bringing
to you guys an outfit of the week video
with my favorite everyday outfits to
wear here in the city these are very
simple and basic and great for all
different weather patterns and there's
my favorites to wear here in City if
you're there you should only subscribe
and hit that button down below I upload
about once a week an expedient fashion
lifestyle videos and you should also go
follow up my other social medias linked
right here so for Monday's outfit I was
wearing something that was definitely
probably for the coolest weather it was
definitely a chilly and rainy day here
in the city my scarf is from airy and my
gray jacket is from Zara and then I'm
just wearing a basic long-sleeve shirt
which is from the lost my black jeans
are from made well they're my favorites
and then my shoes on my Steve Madden
shoes I love them because they're very
Western and they get a kind of different
vibe to this outfit so Tuesday's Alpha
is definitely one of my favorites for
just running errands getting groceries
doing all the stuffs that I have to do
this is a very very simple outfit my
turtleneck is thirsted but it's
originally from Lands End and then I'm
just wearing my crops made well jeans
from made well and then my high-top
white leather converse which I love and
then my aviator sunglasses are from Ray
Bans I think this off it is really
really simple in cute and happen to be
really warm this day and so it was
perfect for the weather and definitely
my go-to quick throw on outfit for
Wednesday this one is definitely a
little bit more dressed up the shoes are
a little bit of a focal point I'm just
wearing this turtleneck which it was
also thrifted from a local fur store my
jeans are from made well they're the
ones I wore the first outfit and then my
shoes which are my favorite part of
outfit are from ModCloth I think they
add just the perfect touch of color to
dis out fit and they are super cute
so for Thursday's outfit happened to be
so warm it literally felt like spring
everybody was out in the neighborhood it
was so great my top is from Urban
Outfitters I just tied that and I'm
wearing mom made well high-waisted
cropped pants which I could finally
break out since like 50 degrees my shoes
are from Lucky Brand and I also threw
this cardigan over which is from Urban
Outfitters with the same Ray Ban aviator
sunglasses definitely more summery and
springy but I had two guys I was loving
the weather I wanted at that
and Friday salsa is definitely the most
casual this is kind of a typical college
look I'm wearing at this baseball cap
which is actually from my boyfriend
Aaden I think it's really really cute
it's just red and definitely different
I'm not used to wearing baseball caps
and I'm just wearing a white t-shirt
from Uniqlo and I made well gray
cardigan and then the saying that made
well black jeans because black jeans are
my staple guys and then my shoes are
from Cole Haan I love them because
they're tennis shoes but they're a
little bit more fashionable which is
really really awesome for walking around
the city and love them and that is it
for my outfit of the week video I hope

guys some inspiration I love you guys so
much bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
