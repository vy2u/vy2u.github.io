hi guys today I'm here to do a video
about new hi guys stay I'm here to do a
video showing you guys how to do some
do-it-yourself summer tops so I have
four different styles to show you guys
that venture from just cutting your old
tops
dyeing them doing really fun things that
are actually really great to do when
you're born in the summer like me it's
just a really great way to take some of
your old clothes and make them into
something new it's really cool and I
have a lot of fun filming this for you
guys if you try out any of the tops from
this video you should definitely show me
a picture on Twitter Instagram and I'll
definitely like it in comment and it'll
be really cool to see your guys's
recreations also don't forget to stay
tuned till the end of this video because
I have a really fun giveaway where I'm
giving away one of the shirts that I
actually made so definitely stay tuned
for that it'll be at the end and let's
just go ahead and get started so we are
starting off with my favorite shirt
which is the super cute watermelon one
is aqua and one so for what you're going
to need for this project you are going
to need a white tee you can either use
an old one or purchase one you will need
some spray fabric paint I used red and
green then you also need a fabric marker
to draw the seeds so first I'm just
cutting off the bottom of the shirt to
make a cropped t-shirt you can measure
it to where you would want it to be
cropped this is just how much I want it
off so at first I wanted to create a
line to divide the green in red but I
actually don't really like how that
looks so I wouldn't recommend it but I
just want him with the red and I sprayed
it along the bottom of the shirt until I
liked the color I kind of did a light
reddish pink and then I went in and did
the green and again I try to create a
line but I wouldn't recommend doing this
and then just did the green and don't
forget to get the size of the shirt and
underneath the arms because I rolled
mine up and you'd want it to so be green
then I just went ahead and did the same
thing on the back side
no time to waste in an hour so the paint
will be dry and then you can wash it in
72 hours and then I just went and drew
my seeds in you can freehand it like me
or do a stencil whatever you please just
make sure you're drawing underneath
something because it will bleed through
if you don't and yeah that's it for this
little crop t-shirt I love it I think
it's so summery and fun and super easy
next we are making this purpley blue
galaxy ombre tank top I love this one
and it's definitely my second favorite
shirt so first you're going to need a
white shirt again you can use an old one
or go ahead and buy one they're pretty
cheap and again some spray fabric paint
I am using black purple in blue so first
I'm cutting off the arms to where it's
kind of a halter top you can freehand
this like me that's what I did and it
worked out pretty well and then I'm
going ahead and cropping the bottom of
the shirt to like I did with the first
shirt I did this one a little less
cropped though so to create the ombre
effect just do the purple on the bottom
first and spray it a lot to where it's
very dark and then gradually go up and
spray less and less if I make sense and
that's why you're going to get the ombre
look so I'm doing this to the back and
the front and making sure to get the
sides I also mixed a little bit of the
black in the blue and do the same thing
with the blue to give it a galaxy look
and again just let the shirt dry for an
hour and you can wash it in three days
and that's it for the galaxy tank top
the third shirt we are making is this
dip dyed fringe tank top all you will
need for this DIY is an old tank top and
some basic fabric dye so I'm starting
off by cutting off the bottom of the
shirt to make it more cropped and then I
went ahead and cut the little pieces at
the bottom so then you get the fringe
effect and I just tied knots at the
bottom so they wouldn't fray and then I
stretched them out so they were a little
bit longer for the dyeing process you're
going to get some steaming hot water
mine wasn't hot enough so make sure it's
steaming 1/4 cup of salt and then you
can also put the dye in and make sure
everything is dissolved and nice then
you just submerge your shirt into the
water for about 45 minutes and
occasionally stir mine didn't die
completely how I wanted it to because my
water wasn't hot enough but yeah just
make sure the water is hot and do the
instructions exactly and then I just
rinsed out the dye and washed it in the
washer and that was pretty much it for
this tank top
lastly we're making this loose ribbon
tank which is a great way to turn a
t-shirt into a tank top so all you're
going to need for this is an old shirt
that you want to turn into a tank top
and also some ribbon of your choice of
color so I'm starting off by cutting off
the sleeves and to kind of a halter
style but more of a tank top I don't
know just how I'm doing right here and
then I'm cutting off the top collar in
the back and the front the same length
then at the bottom of the shirt I'm
cutting out kind of a sharkbite shape
just so the ends are longer than the
middle and then I'm measuring out my
ribbon and tying the back into a knot
with two different types of ribbon so I
did two strands and yeah that was it
so those are all shirts that we are
creating in this video and now on to the
giveaway so she go yeah sure I will be
giving away this watermelon crops
t-shirt because this one was my favorite
