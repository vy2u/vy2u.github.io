about my favorite healthy breakfast food
ideas I wouldn't note that I am sick
right now we can't already tell I'm
losing my voice so the voice-over is
kind of hard to listen to and this is
kinda hard to listen to I want to say
I'm sorry but I still wanted to get this
video for you guys I know these foods
aren't necessarily completely healthy
there are some things that some people
might say aren't healthy but to me these
are just better options opposed to other
alternatives so in this video I have
some blueberry banana pancakes
strawberry banana quesadillas and of
course avocado toast he's such as been a
personal favorite recently
I want to apologize for not uploading
two times this week I've had a lot going
on you should check out this vlog that I
posted I talked more about that so I
don't want to rants not rant but I don't
want to talk too much as it's intro so
if you're interested you can go watch
that video but of course if you're new
you should definitely subscribe to my
channel I upload on Sundays or Thursdays
or Sundays and Thursdays and I'd really
appreciate it so with all that being
said let's go ahead and get into the
video so first we're starting off with
the banana blueberry pancakes which are
my personal favorite so what you're
going to need is a banana make sure it's
ripe an egg some almond milk or normal
milk some whole wheat flour baking
powder blueberries so we're starting off
by blending up V banana the egg 3/4 a
cup of almond milk 1 and 3/4 a cup of
wheat flour and then 2 teaspoons of
baking powder along with 3/4 a cup of
blueberries just blending this in my
ninja bullet and then I'm pouring in the
rest of the blueberries you can do
however much you want I kind of just put
some in there then I'm spraying my pan
and cooking my pancakes like you
normally would I kind of burnt mine a
little bit but they were still tasty
guys don't worry
then I am just talking off my pancakes
with some blueberries and some honey as
a healthier alternative compared to
syrup and there you have the delicious
banana blueberry pancakes next we are
making some strawberry banana peanut
butter quesadillas guys so good so for
this recipe you're going to need some
wheat tortillas a ripe banana peanut
butter strawberries and then some
cinnamon which is optional but I'd
recommend it so all you have to do is
chop up your fruit as thin as you
possibly can so the quesadilla is not
too thick then I'm spreading the peanut
butter on both tortillas just a thin
layer and then I'm decorating my and I
just put them in a random pattern
because I don't like patterns and then
I'm just sprinkling on some cinnamon
putting on my top layer and spraying my
pan and I'm just cooking my quesadilla
about two minutes on each side just so
it warms up the inside and then I'm
cutting it and it is so good guys this
is so delicious and it's so easy to make
and the last option is some avocado
toast I know you've probably seen this
everywhere by now I'm sorry but all you
need is an avocado and some whole wheat
bread so I'm just toasting my bread and
then I'm mushing up my avocado and a
bowl and I just added some pepper
because I personally really like pepper
then I'm just spreading on the avocado
and adding some tomatoes which is
definitely optional but I just like to
give mine a little more flavor sometimes
I will also fry an egg which is it
necessary I know not everyone thinks
eggs are healthy but sometimes if I'm
more hungry I will add a fried egg and
that's it super yummy and filling so
those are the breakfast food ideas that
I have to share with you guys if you
enjoyed this definitely give this video
a like because I really appreciate that
it lets me know if you guys enjoyed the
video if you want to know how to get the
things that you want in life you should
definitely go watch my last video it was
all about that and I gave some advice in
that video so I'll see you guys in my
next one
