it's not summer
Oh
everybody say I'm going to be doing
three very easy hairstyles for back to
school because I know sometimes whenever
you're waking up early you can wake up
too late or you're just having a bad
hair day or you don't feel like doing
anything to your hair so you need some
really easy hairstyles to do I am so not
talented with hair so these hair cells
are pretty basic and easy but I think
sometimes simplicity is nice so I really
hope you guys enjoyed this and let's
just go ahead and get started so first
we're gonna be starting off with this
very simple braided hairstyle so first
I'm just finding my middle part and then
teasing the crown of my hair and the
sides of my hair then I am taking the
front piece of hair and i'm doing a
French braid but I'm not the best at
French braiding I still mess up so if
you can't French braid just do a normal
braid and it honestly kind of looks the
same but I'm just doing this to each
side and then I'm going to be pinning it
and kind of pushing the hair up for a
little more volume and then I'm
finishing off with some hairspray and
that's it for this hairstyle
and now we are on to the five strand
braid which is kind of difficult but
once you get it it's really easy so
first I am just teasing the top of my
hair and also keeping the middle part
and then I am just going to gather my
hair to one side and sectioning it off
to five pieces so the basic technique to
this is you go over with one piece of
hair and then under the next piece of
hair and then twist up or pull up not
twist up and this is what's going to
give the five strand braid look I
actually watched another video to learn
and I will link it down below it's a lot
better than my explanation so I
definitely recommend watching that video
what I think the braid is really cool so
I decided to include it in this video so
then I'm just tying it off with a clear
elastic and then kind of pinning some
parts of my hair back so it doesn't fall
out and then finish it off with some
hairspray and that's it
so now we're on to the super cute
braided topknot button so first I am
just going to put my hair up into a very
high ponytail you can put it up at
whatever height you want to then I'm
just grabbing a piece of hair and
braiding it from the back and pinning it
off so I don't get confused with it with
the other hair then I'm twisting the
ponytail and wrapping it around itself
to form kind of a messy bun and then I'm
kind of just pulling some pieces out and
pinning some pieces until i get my
desired shape then I'm just wrapping the
braid around the base of the bun and
pinning it and that is it for this
hairstyle so that is it for the
hairstyles I really hope you guys
enjoyed this and maybe try some of these
out whenever you're having a bad hair
