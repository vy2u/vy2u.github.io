time on Instagram I'm also really
obsessed with Instagram stories you

let's just go ahead and get right into
it so for outfit number one I think this
one is so cute I'm obsessed with long
skirts right now so I think this one is
just great my skirt is from 2020 Ave
which is an online boutique
I'll have link down below you should
definitely check out and then I'm
wearing a body suit from made well I
think body suits are awesome because
they tuck in so well to dresses and this
one was like on sale for $10 and then my
shoes are just these pointed flats which
I believe are from j.crew but yeah this
is one of my favorite outfits because
it's comfy but still like modest and
appropriate and I just really like it so
for my second outfit my top is so cute
I love things that like tie on the side
I just think they're really like flirty
and fun and girly and this one it's from
2020 Avenue and then these are my
favorite Madewell jeans they kind of
like button up and they're high-waisted
so they're definitely my favorite style
and then my shoes are just these kids
floral tennis shoes I love the kids
rifle Paper Company collaboration
they're so cute and I think they really
like jazz up any outfit
so this next outfit is definitely a
little bit more chic if I do say my body
suit is from forever 21 I love love this
one so it's like eight bucks it's really
simple and I just threw over this long
kind of button-down top which is from
2020 AB which is really oversized kind
of look so you just threw on your
boyfriend shirt I think that that style
is really cute and then my jeans are
just Jo gene zip my shoes are from Steve
Madden and then my earrings that I'm
wearing are from made well I think
they're so cute so you just add like a
more sophisticated touch to any outfit
and then this last one is also one of my
favorites it's super cozy but still like
really easy to just throw on I'm wearing
a beret which I thrifted
which I'm still like getting used to
wearing but I think they're really cute
for fall and then my sweater is from
