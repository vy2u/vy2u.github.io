currently in college and so today's
video I'm gonna be showing you guys my
everyday college makeup routine for 2018
this look is actually based off of this
Instagram photo that I posted because a
lot of you guys said you wanted to see
this makeup if you just claimed rights
before I start I am wearing a jumpsuit
in this video I know it looks like I'm
not but I promise I'm wearing clothes
just really comfy also I do like to wear
makeup to college so if you don't that's
totally cool but I know there are a lot
of girls out there who are like me who
like getting done up for class I think
that's totally cool so also in this
video I used the new Beauty Blender blue
cool Beauty Blender and I actually have
two of these so I'm gonna be giving one
away in this video this isn't sponsored
I just thought I would like give this to
you guys because I'm sure someone would
use this cuz these things are way too
expensive all you have to do to enter is
make sure to follow me on instagram
which is that michelle read and
subscribe to this channel then whatever
you comment down below just say what
grade you're in so if you're in college
what grade are you and if you're in high
school also leave your instagram at name
so i can contact you because otherwise
we're not gonna be able to actually like
figure out where your address is
everything that i have to say so let's
just go ahead and get right into this
makeup routine because i haven't done
one and a little bit so starting out I
always use this but this is the Laura
Mercier foundation primer it this is the
hydrating one because I have super dry
skin and obviously as you can tell I
wanted to like do this on my skin it's
like at its worst and I have this huge
pimple on my cheek and I just think
that's reality in college sometimes I
watch these videos and it's like these
people with absolutely perfect skin but
I definitely have like the worst skin
whenever I'm in college I also have
awful under-eye circles today and that's
because sleep has been something that
hasn't really been happening so also I
feel like I might get questions about my
hair in this video all I did was sleep
in two french braids and then I undid it
and this is the hair that I guess
foundation I used the Born This Way
Foundation from Too Faced I love this
foundation I think it's such a good
foundation doesn't really look cakey it
just works really well with my skin I
know not everyone wears foundation to
college and if you don't like that's
totally cool I just personally like
wearing foundation I think it really
evens out my
town and I feel like something makes you
feel more confident and I not do it you
guys aren't following me on Instagram I
have been posting a lot of outfit
pictures lately I've really been trying
to do more like fashion II kind of
Instagram posts like showing outfits and
stuff I've just been really into fashion
lately and like wearing different things
and so if you want to follow me it's
Michelle Reed I've also been listing a
lot of items on the dope app which is
basically an online shopping mall this
isn't sponsored I just want to let you
guys know I get a lot of questions of
where things that I'm wearing are from
and they're always on dope so you should
definitely follow me on there and if you
buy something you can get five dollars
off and free shipping - the code in the
shell I'm just using a Beauty Blender as
well I'm the blender kind of girl I
don't really like using brushes because
I finally it was kind of cakey if the
lighting gets funky it's just because
it's about to storm so now for concealer
I'm using this is the fit me concealer
from Maybelline obviously we got a lot
to conceal so usually start with just
under my eyes so kind of a college
update I graduate in a year and a half
so it's coming up soon you guys are just
tuning in I go to the Kings College in
New York City it's a really small
Christian school I'm a business major so
I don't have like a specific focus I
just like am a general business degree
for like life plans I'm gonna be honest
guys I don't really know what I'm doing
I know I still have time so it's not
like a huge worry but I'm debating
between like should I stay in New York
for the summer should I go home
should I in turn this year should I know
a thing about New York is a lot of the
internships here are unpaid which is
just really hard if you're like staying
here over the summer paying rent for the
summer and you're doing an unpaid
internship and then doing another job -
it's just really hard and the
internships here are a lot of time so
I'm kind of like in this process where
I'm like weighing the pros and cons like
should I invest all my time in my
YouTube channel to possibly like do
something bigger with this or should I
dedicate more time to getting a job
outside
- it's just a really hard balance to
find a figural so to set my makeup I'm
using the Maybelline fit me powder as
well I never saw myself as someone who
we'd be doing like YouTube full-time and
like just being a youtuber because that
always seemed very fleeting but it's
just like while in college it's the
thing that makes me the happiest and I
find the most joy from doing it mainly
because I feel like I've gotten to like
make a message that's bigger than myself
and so I know it's just been hard to
like figure out should I be investing my
time elsewhere or investing my time
other areas I've been blogging so much
on my second channel I just feel like
I'm kicking it with the vlog viewers
like you guys are just so good if you
want to tune in enjoy my little fam I
honestly love my vlog channel so much
it's Michelle out of her shell for
living for next year I kind of have to
start figuring that out as well so it'll
be my last year in school and I'm pretty
sure I am living with my friend Rose and
her roommate Rio next year and I'm gonna
be moving off campus so finding our own
place which would be so cool I'd
probably be sharing a room with Rose
which you really get used to sharing a
room in college like it's not really a
big deal you don't know where we're
gonna live I feel like in New York
finding an apartment it's kind of just
whatever you land on and that's kind of
like how you do it and it set the rest
of my face I use the Laura Mercier
candle glow perfecting powder just like
a shimmery powder and since my skin is
so dry I don't like to set all of my
face and I like to use a blender because
it just keeps it nice and moisturized
not super cakey or anything kind of just
gives you a nice like subtle glow all
over your face so after that for bronzer
I'm just using my Tarte Park app
princess bronzer I love this bronzer I
just think that it is a really nice like
simple kind of bronzer I'm gonna be
honest guys have been really cakey with
the contour lately it has not been
looking that good no judge but I feel
like you get to the age of like I'm
turning 20 this year and you feel like
you have to have everything in your life
figure it out and I'm just like getting
to the point where I'm like no she'll
you know so now for blush I'm using the
butter blush from decision
for me oh this is in the shade vintage
Bruges and I'm just gonna apply a little
bit of this all over my cheeks I kind of
go above the apples of my cheeks just
got so dark I'm also kind of ready to
have an apartment that's not a studio
apartment just because we're living in a
studio apartment there's like no sense
of privacy you have to wake up at the
same time as the other person because
you're in literally a shoebox this place
is tiny I love this apartment it's so
cute I'm so thankful for it but I think
having a one-bedroom apartment is gonna
be like such an upgrade it's over
highlight I am just using this Laura
Mercier highlight in the shade and
discretion or indiscretion this pimple
doesn't even cover to keep my brows
really simple all I've really been using
lately is the Too Faced natural eye
palette and I just take the shade
cashmere bunny and I apply this in my
brows I then just take my benefit gimme
brow which is like a little bit of a
shame to it and you just put it through
your brows obviously I'm not a beauty
guru I'm just a college girl for
eyeshadow
I use meet that trim Oni palette which
is basically just a palette of all matte
shades I'm specifically gonna be using
these to kind of like oranjee shades I'm
just gonna apply these to my lid and
then also to my crease a wintertime is
just kind of nice to give your eyes like
a little bit more of a warm tone to that
so then after that I kind of like to mix
this red shade and then also this brown
shade and I just put them together and
put them on kind of like the outer
corner / a little bit in the crease
somedays in college I will skip eyeliner
some days I'll do it it just kind of
depends but I'm just gonna curl my
eyelashes and apply these scandalize
retro glam from Rimmel mascara I'm so
excited because this weekend I am
actually going skiing for the first time
I'm going with this company called
skedaddle
I'm filming a weekend in my life video
it's like my first trip for like a
youtube related thing which I'm really
excited Forks I've never actually done
that's been like a goal of mine but I
just have a feeling I'm gonna need
so bad at ski just because I didn't grow
up doing it I feel like I'm Way not
coordinated enough you know I dance I
still feel like it's a little bit
different
I'm obviously staying on like the bunny
slopes but I would still appreciate it
Phillips
I feel like this kind of makes
everything come together but I'm using
the Laura Mercier velour extreme matte
lipstick in the shade cool it's a coral
color this lipstick is so good not
specifically just this one but this Brad
they stay on all day they don't dry out
your lips they're awesome they're
basically the only ones I use I would
highly recommend them and then you have
the very pretty orange coral I hope you

fun making it for you guys I really hope
