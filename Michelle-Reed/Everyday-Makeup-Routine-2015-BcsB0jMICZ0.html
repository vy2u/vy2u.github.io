I'm going to be doing in everyday makeup
routine for school or just kind of what
I've been doing lately now not every day
I'm gonna wear eyeshadow or not every
day I'm gonna wear lipstick but this is
kind of whatever I want to put a little
more effort in so I will add and take
things out of this routine but this is
generally what it usually is it is
actually a snow day yes a snow day in
Texas today so I took the opportunity to
film this video for you guys and I could
not be happier today I'm literally in
the best mood and I'm so happy and I
have no worries it is great
make sure to follow me on Instagram and
Twitter and tell me how you like this
video follow me some screenshots of this
video I would love to see that you're
watching because you guys mean the world
to me and I guess we're gonna go ahead
and get into the video right now so
before starting my makeup I always have
to moisturize so I've been using my
Clinique waste your Serge lately this
stuff rocks and it makes my face feel so
nice I definitely recommend it and then
I just go in with some concealer I
haven't been using foundation recently
because my skin has been pretty clear
but I love my Maybelline instant age
rewind it is great and then I like to
use a wet Beauty Blender with this so it
doesn't absorb all of the products
I've been spend enough time and I've
actually moved on from I stay matte
powder and I've been using my Revlon
Colorstay lately
it gives pretty good coverage and I
think it's nice if you're just wearing
concealer because it does give you more
coverage than a translucent powder and
then I also use my clinic blush and
sunset glow it's a really pretty almost
kind of broad and see blush peachy
colored it's really nice I love it for
brows I just go in with my benefit brow
kit and filled them in a little bit I'm
not into like super structured brows but
I do like to give them a little bit to
color and that is it for the face to
prime my eyes for eyeshadow I love my
lorac eye primer it keeps it on all day
and I love it and then I like to use a
champagne color base this is my typical
one from Maybelline I love it and then I
like to use my Urban Decay eye shadow in
sin all over my lid and for my crease
color I take my lorac Pro palette and
use the color taupe and I put this in my
crease I love it it's my favorite crease
color and then I just put a little bit
of pewter in the outer corner then I
just take the cream color and I put this
under my brows to highlight and then I
finished off with my they're real
eyeliner I love this stuff it's super
easy to use and then lastly I just apply
a little bit of mascara this is the
Maybelline great lash this is actually
so awesome it's my new favorite and I
definitely recommend it then I applied
my EOS lip-balm in some days I will just
apply this but I actually decided to use
my Mac rebel lipstick to give my lips a
little bit of a raspberry tint but I
made sure to sheer it out a lot and I
definitely got some on my teeth right
here and that is everything that I
typically put on my face
so that's pretty much it for my routine
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video and maybe it helped you guys out
with some new products that you might
want to try out because I love
everything in this video I rarely change
up my routine as you guys can probably
notice so these products are my favorite
and I swear by them and I will have them
all linked in the downbar let me know of
your favorite products in your makeup
routine because I'm always up for trying
out new things so definitely leave that
down below and I will try to reply to
you guys and I'll see you guys there
next video
I literally just wandering my clothes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
