everybody today I'm going to be bringing
to you guys my everyday makeup tutorial
for 2017 this is the look that I'm
pretty sure I'm going to be wearing for
most of the year it's super duper just
natural and pretty and great for
everyday I haven't done just like a
basic everyday makeup look in a while
and so I decided to bring this to you
today as always if you stumbled across
this video and you're not subscribe you
should definitely subscribe I upload one
to two times a week and I love love love
posting videos for you guys you should
definitely hit that down below you
should also go subscribe to my blog
channel it'll be linked right on the
screen right here I have been vlogging
so so so much more this year yeah that's
everything that I have to say so let's
just go ahead and get right into the
makeup look so starting off I am using
my covergirl Ready Set gorgeous
foundation I've recently went back to
this one and I've been self-tanning into
my neck is a little bit Tanner than my
face is I'm going to try to even out my
skin tone with this I've still been
using my Beauty Blender as always I just
love how this looks I know people are
starting to move back to brushes but I
just feel like the Beauty Blender gives
such a clean natural finish which is
something I always really like
super guys I'm using my instant age
rewind eraser dark circle and I'm just
going to cover up my eyelids with this
you can use primer if you want to I just
find that concealer honestly evens on my
own then I'm taking my Laura Mercier
silk powder and I'm just going to set
that concealer with a little bit on my
finger just so it doesn't crease or
anything so far I shadow I have been
very much into keeping things really
really simple I'm in college so I don't
really have a lot of time to do like
really intense eye look so all I've
really been doing is taking the
eyeshadow buck for my Naked palette it's
just this really nice kind of taupe
brown color and all I do is apply this
to my lid and also in my crease and I
have a very nice like mono eyeshadow lid
look and I honestly think it's really
easy but it does look put together so
let's I'm going to go ahead and do right
now just like a flat
for eyeliner I'm using my Clinique
high-impact custom black eyeliner I
really like this because it's not a
liquid eyeliner it's just a nice kind of
coal liner and I think it looks really
pretty on the upper lash line whenever
you smudge it it looks very kind of like
smoky and pretty going back in with my
concealer I'm going to do my under eye
circles because I have very dark under
eye circles few of them never get enough
sleep I like to do my eyeshadow first
just so I can clean up right here
wherever it falls then I'm just using my
Beauty Blender and I'm going to blend
this then it means my Laura Mercier soap
powder and I'm going to bake my
concealer which I've been doing a lot I
just honestly think it works really well
you know how Big E is basically you just
take your powder and you take a lot of
it on a Beauty Blender you just apply it
underneath your eyes to your concealer
and let it sit for about five ish
minutes basically just let this sit for
a little while and it really sets my
concealer and I find it just makes the
look come together more and I think if
you have time in the morning that it
really does help so while this bangs and
I look like an absolute crazy person I
am using my benefit gimme brow product
and I'm going to just swipe this through
my brows to thicken them up I don't
really like to shape my brows or do
anything crazy I think it's just nice to
thicken my brows to make them look a
little bit crazy
so just fight off the rest of the powder
after letting it sit for five minutes
and then I'm going back in with my Naked
palette I'm taking that buck shade which
I used on my lid I'm going to apply this
to my lower lash line I'm going to
highlight my inner corner on my eye I'm
using my Clinique chubby stick in the
shade hefty highlight it's just a nice
highlighter and it's cream and so I'm
going to take a little bit of this on my
finger for mascara guys I have found my
Holy Grail mascara this is the best
mascara ever I recently did a video with
Clinique and they sent this to me but I
have been obsessed with it it's the
Clinique flutter to full mascara
basically you can choose like what
degree of like mascara you want to put
on your eyelashes but it is just awesome
I don't know why but it really lengthens
my lashes and it makes them so much
fuller but I've just got obsessed with
this so I'm going to go ahead and coat
my eyelashes
so don't ever finish with the eyes I'm
using my Too Faced chocolate Soleil
bronzer I'm just going to bronze my
cheekbones my forehead and my chin and
do a little bit of contouring blush I'm
using my Tarte Amazonian clay 12-hour
blush in the shade peaceful I'm going to
apply this to my cheekbones and up above
for highlight I'm using the highlighter
that I use for my eyes and it is the
Clinique one and I'm basically just
taking this on my Beauty Blender on the
tip and I'm going to apply this to my
upper cheekbones my chin my nose on my
forehead this highlighter is so pretty
and it gives just the prettiest dewy
finish to your look which I think dewy
skin is so so so pretty and glowy
expecially for starting the new year so
I'm just going to go ahead
number list I'm using my NYX lingerie
liquid lipstick in the shade
I'm apply this to my lips it's a really
pretty nude color I think it looks great
with the eyeshadow so that is it for
this makeup tutorial I really hope you
