these but I'm sorry gonna have I'll try
to yeah hi guys
today I am here with Gunnar aka my
boyfriend and we haven't done a video in
forever especially this one today he is
going to be doing a back to school
makeup tutorial basically like when I
wear every day but he's gonna do it it's
gonna be really fun haven't done one of
these videos since like a year and a
half ago this time it's gonna be good if
you're new to my channel you should
always subscribe it'll be right here or
down below and I definitely appreciate
that like this video if you'd like to
see more videos with Gunnar because we
gotta have those likes so with all that
being said we're gonna go ahead and get
into the video
starting with foundation infallible Pro
matte are your hands clean yeah
yeah I kind of feel skinny honesty
foundation is complete I know what this
is
that is not next which brush do you want
there's actually a lot of different ones
you can use can achieve it's quite nice
having someone else do your makeup yeah
I'm down I'm down I wash them like once
a week
I think my eyebrows need you need me I
needed my eyebrows filled in see this is
where being an art student comes into
play they look pretty defined than me
that's right well she's obviously
connect this is a pink that is
translucent should I do like the end
thing that focus
whoa you've got a snack because you're
being a terrible patient in a Minecraft
this one I'm kind of just smeared it on
there remember girl smearing is key
look at me okay should we go on to the
eye makeup now oh boy let's get naked
we're gonna use five let's go there is
that all the
do really good choice
no we're relaxing whenever I see girls
look like terrible I make it up home yet
it's okay I may be pain I seen videos of
guys trying to use eyeliner that's bad
it could be worse don't try wing okay
try you don't want me to do the under
eye yeah I usually don't do under is
thanks
yeah I'd stab you so much for school
right
that was close
you're scaring me usually oh my god this
is a trust exercise
I got that one on I'm gonna love your
face yeah the eye look is complete I
would say so this is the completed look
that Gunnar did and I feel like eyeliner
is I feel like black mark it was a bad
idea after I feel like the blush and
contour pretty good though I'm a
blushing look circle chunky I don't
really I'll describe it chunky this is
what we got this is what we're working
with you might want to stay home yeah
yeah so that's the end of this video I
really hope you guys enjoyed watching
this and maybe got a couple of tips
because you know maybe me doing what not
to do so what if we learned don't use
black market
sure don't use don't get too chunky on
the woods true don't attempt a wing if
wings are Hornets do it if either in the
mood for another one of my videos you
should definitely watch my after school
routine which was the last video I
posted and I had a lot of fun filming
that and I think is we're not pretty
well so we will see you guys in our next
video together bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
