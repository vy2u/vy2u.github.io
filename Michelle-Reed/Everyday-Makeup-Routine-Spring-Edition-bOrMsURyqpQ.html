very very requested video today and it's
going to be my everyday makeup routine
because in the past like 3 or 4 videos a
lot of people haven't asked me like so
how'd you do your makeup I really like a
makeup how'd you do it everyday makeup
between questionmark
and so I decided that I would finally
put up this video and let you guys know
how I've been doing my makeup lately now
I don't change up the products I use
very often and so you can really rely on
these products and know that I love them
a lot they're all awesome you've
probably already seen them in a lot of
videos that's just because I don't
change them up if I find something I
love I'm gonna keep using it so but if
you want to know the products I use just
go down to the downbar I'll probably
have them in the video too but just if
you want a list they will be all down
below so I think that's everything I
have to say so let's just go ahead and
get into the video
so first I'm using my covergirl stay
fabulous foundation and I'm applying
this to my face it's pretty light
coverage yet it kind of clears my face
and just makes it look smooth and I've
been using it for a while then I'm using
my Revlon Photoready concealer and it's
a great cream stick concealer so really
covers under-eye circles and blemishes
really really well and it's my new
favorite concealer and then I'm using my
holy grail stay matte powder from Rimmel
I've used this for a year I think now
and it's honestly the best for just
covering up oily skin and making your
skin really soft and smooth then I'm
using my Mac blush and stay by me which
is a really pretty pink peachy color and
I think it gives my skin that kind of
glow that I need
and then for some extra glow I'm using
my benefit high beam highlighter and
I'll playing this to the tops of my
cheekbones because I love the way it
makes my skin look in the Sun it's just
like flawless if you know I'm saying and
then I'm using my benefit browsing brow
kits and filling in my brows just a
little bit not till they look fake but
just give them a little bit of
definition and then I'm using my
Maybelline Color tattoo and barely
branded which is a really pretty light
champagne color it's just a good base
for my eye shadow and I'm taking my
Urban Decay Naked palette and using the
color in sin which is a really pretty
just light champagne to kind of set that
cream shadow then I'm using naked which
is a really pretty kind of light brown
color and I'm applying this to my crease
then lastly I just kind of mix smog into
our course and put it in my outer corner
for a little bit of definition and then
of course you got to blend this all out
so using my handy-dandy blending brush
and of course I wasn't even in the frame
in this part fail so then I did a thin
line of eyeliner but I'm terrible doing
eyeliner on camera so sorry then I'm
just curling my eyelashes with my
Sephora curling eyelash curler what did
I just say here then I'm using my
Maybelline the rocket mascara to my
eyelashes it's my favorite mascara
and that is it for the eyes your lips
I'm using my clinic lipstick in
raspberry gloss it's kind of a pretty
raspberry color and I'm in just applying
it to my lips and kind of shearing it
out so it's not so bold but more natural
and that is it's for the makeup so
that's the end of this video I really
