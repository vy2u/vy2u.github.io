makeup routine just for school or days
in general and the music is by Foster
the People so to start off I'm just
using my Maybelline fit me foundation
stick and I'm applying this to my face I
love it because it's matte and I can
just use it on areas that I need more
coverage and then I'm just blending that
in with a sponge and concealing my
under-eye circles with my Garnier
rollerball I love this because it deep
Huff's my eyes and conceals and then you
see my stay back powder I am just
setting all of the face makeup
for blush I'm using my ELF cream blush
just to make me look less dead in the
morning and I actually look like a human
being and then I'm taking a white
eyeshadow base from NYX and using this
as my primer so my eyeshadow stick and
show up and then I'm just taking a
shimmery champagne color from my in the
light palette and applying that to my
lid and applying a taupe color to the
crease just to define it and then a
darker Brown to the outer corner and all
of these are a part of my Sela palette
if I didn't say that and then I am just
simply aligning my eyes with a dark
brown eyeliner
and then just curling my eyelashes with
a Revlon eyelash curler and applying my
favorite mascara which is the Maybelline
one by one
lastly I'm just taking a Clinique chubby
stick and mega melon and I do this
occasionally for school not everyday but
if that is it's for my everyday makeup
routine and I hope you guys enjoyed this
xoxo Michelle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
