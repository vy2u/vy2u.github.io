my everyday summer makeup routine
because in a video a while back I asked
if you guys would like to see this video
and a lot of people said yes so we're
gonna do it today I know that the title
says every day summer makeup routine but
it's a little deceiving because this is
more just in whenever I actually want to
look decent video so I don't don't
really do this every day because
typically I choose to look like this but
I hope you guys are ok with them also
today I went from kind of avicii mermaid
style hair style thing today but I'm
feeling more like this warrior in the
nineties and roomy enough said that's
we're just going to go ahead and get
into this video because I hate long
intros after you make sure to LIKE this
video so we're gonna back up into it I
was so dumb I really apologize so I
don't really know I got so excited with
the waving but we're starting off with
our bare skin and then I'm gonna take my
Porefessional primer to prime my face I
love it because it fills in all my pores
makes my skin base mood and it's just
really great then I'm taking my boots
number 7 foundation it's like this stay
matte kind of one I absolutely love this
foundation because it keeps my skin Matt
all day and it stays on all day and it's
literally the perfect foundation then
i'm taking my rug one photo ready
concealer I'm concealing my blemishes
and my under eye circles
then I'm taking my stay matte powder and
I'm setting everything I know I uses in
like every video but it's amazing
believe me and I'm taking my elf blush
in Bella log and I'm applying this to my
cheeks to get my skin a little bit of
color then for eyebrows i'm using my
benefit I rock it and I just filling
them in a little bit not too much then
i'm using my seal a switch pot and
kitten and i'm using this as my primer
and then we're taking my Urban Decay
Naked 3 palette and using the eyeshadows
strange i'm applying this over top of
that base then i'm taking the eyeshadow
limit and i'm applying this in the
crease and for the outer corner we are
going to be using factory and mugshot
I'm just kind of mixing those and we
always gotta blend you cannot forget to
blend then i'm also using my ELF gel
eyeliner which you guys know I can't do
on camera and then I just curl my
eyelashes and applied my Rockets mascara
and for the lips i'm using my Revlon lip
butter and raspberry pi I just kind of
sheared out a little bit I will kind of
switch off my lip color someday I'll do
nude someday I'll do Barry damn that's
it for the makeup I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video because I enjoyed
making it for you guys like always make
