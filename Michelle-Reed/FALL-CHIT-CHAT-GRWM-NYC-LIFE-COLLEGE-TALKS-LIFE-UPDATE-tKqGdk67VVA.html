8:30 in the morning and I'm sitting down
I'm filming a chit chat and get ready
with me video with you guys because
obviously I've been in college for like
two months now and I feel like I have
not just talked to you guys about how
life has been going and so I just really
wanted to sit down and chat with you
guys so I hope is okay if you're new you
should definitely subscribe the buttons
here I upload once a week and I also
upload more on my blog channel yeah I
know this videos gonna be quite long
because I've missed you guys and I have
so much to talk about so I'm just gonna
go ahead and get into it right now so
right now it's currently 8:30 on a
Friday and so if you're wondering why my
face looks a little bit tired and my
under eyes are bad it's a mix of college
and the fact that it's 8:30 in the
morning and I honestly feel like this is
when I'm in my natural state so it's
honestly the best time to watch me so so
I'm just starting off with my Aveeno
positively radiant and mixing it with my
makeup forever HD foundation I basically
just like to make my own tinted
moisturizer I've been doing this for a
while it basically just typed out some
questions that you guys have asked me on
my Instagram over the past little bit
and I'm just going to go through and
answer those today oh is school going in
general because if you don't know I am
in college and this is my freshman year
and I go to the Kings College in New
York City and I'm majoring in business
it's just a little like run down to
school honestly has been a lot I'm new
color to be a lot I knew I would have a
lot of work I just I like came into it
knowing that it was gonna be hard I go
to a very difficult school and so I did
think I would have a little more like
stability in my life just in terms of
being able to balance YouTube in school
and that kind of stuff more I just want
to know I was sitting in my writing
class the other day and I got bit twice
by something and I don't know what they
are but there's the biggest bug bites
ever I thing about school is I really
enjoy my classes I am still in my core
classes or whatever not taking my actual
degree classes yet
but I really enjoy them like I like
going to class just a really great
school and overall I've been loving it
basically just concealing my eyelids
with this to pry my eyes for the
eyeshadow that I'm gonna be applying
favorite and least part about New York
City
I guess so summer for the least part cuz
I like to end on a good note least
favorite part is probably how long it
takes to do things especially just like
little things like going to the grocery
store I have to walk there you have to
carry everything back you can't buy
everything that you would like to or
else you wouldn't be able to carry it I
mean you can always super home but I try
to save money all the time does New York
City is expensive they're just like
basic stuff like that and just getting
places you have to plan with like the
subway system and you have to plan your
routes really well you can't do things
on a whim but you kind of have to plan
if you're trying to get somewhere on
time that's been something that I have
not been used to I've been showing up
late to things I'm just setting that
with a little bit of pressed powder
favorite part about New York City yeah
there's so many things this is really
cliche and I know everyone's does this
but it's just the fact that everything
is here the amount of people that I've
got to meet so far and just the things
that I've been able to do just because I
live here is really really awesome so a
lot of stuff is it very much based in
Texas and so it's been so nice coming
here and YouTube stuff is here and I
just get to meet people and it's really
really incredible so I've been really
into kind of like the rustic orange eye
shadow look lately and so I'm using my
shade and light palette my Kat Von D but
I'm taking this a peach color right here
I'm just applying this all over my lid
and also in my crease just as a really
nice like transition color how have you
changed since going to college this is
something that I haven't really told
anyone and I feel like I haven't really
thought about that much but honestly you
get over things really really quickly
when you're in college I think in high
school I just thought things were a
bigger deal than they actually were and
I like worry too much about them I do
think I worry here in college especially
about grades and stuff but it's
different kind of boring I don't worry
over just like smaller and more petty
thing
I think I'm worried about in high school
I'm not going in with the more red color
right here and I'm gonna apply this in
my outer corner to add a little bit of
definition per usual how have you
changed since going to college something
you've learned since going to college I
think the biggest thing I've learned in
college so far is definitely just
prioritizing whether that be like
friendships schoolwork YouTube stuff
really learning how to manage my time
better because it's something that you
know you have so many different
opportunities in college to do certain
things and so you really have to choose
you know what is the most important to
you of what you think is gonna benefit
you the most yeah I always said in high
school that I had my time management
skills down and then I came to college
is like no no no you did it Michelle
then I'm just gonna take the cream shade
right here and I'm gonna highlight
underneath my brow bone with this just
to bring in some light into my face
since the eye look is a little bit dark
so then I'm just going in again with my
instant age rewind concealer I'm gonna
apply this underneath my eyes I received
a lot of questions in general just about
how other youtubers you know don't
necessarily go to college and why I went
to college why I think it's important
and all that kind of stuff I just want
to say that for the record I think
everyone has the right to do whatever
they want to do you don't have to go to
college I don't think that college is
for everyone by any means I look like a
crazy person okay but for me personally
you know why I went to college in the
first place I the education is so
incredibly important I'm just for me
personally I think learning and
attaining new knowledge is so so
important and for me I like to do that
in a college setting I don't think you
have to do in a college setting I think
you can just learn by the real world in
general but for me personally I just
really I like to do that at a setting
with other people and with people who
are the same somewhat believes as me I
just think that's important
know that like YouTube is something that
is so fleeting while I love it and I
would never give it up for anything
because I love talking to you guys
obviously it's 8:30 and I chose to wake
up and fill this video instead of
sleeping in because I love talking to
you guys
supportin to me want a degree to be able
to take this into another direction if
you know God doesn't make this my only
plan in life then because I know that I
have a long day today I'm going to go
ahead and bake my concealer I'm using
the Laura Mercier loose powder I let
this sit I'm gonna go ahead and do my
brows all you're doing is applying my
gimme brow from benefit I love this
product and if you have thinner eyebrows
I think it's breaks it really does
thicken them up cryolator I'm using my
Schwing black eyeliner from the balm
this is a really really great eyeliner
and I really like it after eyeliner I'm
just gonna brush off the rest of this
powder other version I thought is just
like in general what my favorite part
about college is I feel like I have
talked about this more on my blog
channel which is Michelle out of your
shell you should definitely follow me on
there because I love love logging I'm
now just going back in with this peach
color I'm applying this underneath my
brow bone I think my favorite part about
college is just probably the people that
I've met here you are just generally
like really great people and I think
they're really really awesome and then
just going back in with the red color
I'm gonna play this in like the very
very outer lower lash line but then I
just curling my eyelashes gonna find my
rocket mascara and then going in with my
Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer I'm
just applying that to my cheeks
favorite moments so far since living
here there's a moment when I was filming
with Taylor crossbreed and not filming
they were taking pictures and I saw a
subscriber who actually goes to NYU and
she came up to me and she said hi and it
was just like one of those moments where
everything kind of like connected and I
was just like you know what my life is
pretty cool and I'm super thankful to
live here and then I'm using my tart
blush in the shade peaceful it's a
really nice just kind of like corally
pink color
the last thing for lips I am using my
meet Matt Hughes lipstick from the balm
and this is in the shade committed and
so that is it for my eye makeup look I
really hope you guys enjoyed watching
this video like always leave your
requests down below I'm so happy that I
got to just sit and talk to you guys
because I haven't gotten to do that in
such a long time and you guys mean that
absolute world to me you should also go

lookbook and I had so much fun filming
