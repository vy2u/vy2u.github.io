of a fall ish clothing / accessory /
makeup ish beauty ish hall because I've
collected a few things over the past
month or so and I decided to show them
to you guys is that a lot by any means
because I guess I just haven't been
quite the shopper lately and I haven't
bought everything for fall yet that I
wanted but I decided to show you guys
stuff that I have bought in the past few
ish weeks or so first I'm going to start
off with a place called choice I think
I'm saying that Ryan it's basically just
an online boutique I will leave it in
the down bar and they sell just really
cute clothes that are pretty average
price some stuff can be kind of
expensive but for the most part it's
pretty cheap the first thing I got is
this sweater and it's very chunky and
net and it has kind of the charcoal
color and then a cream color and then a
blue and it's super pretty and just
comfortable i love it it is one size
fits all but let me just say this is not
one size fits all this is pretty small I
wish it was a little bit bigger but it's
alright it's really cute and comfortable
and perfect for fall because sweaters
are pretty much all I where the whole
time I also got this dress now this
isn't gonna be everybody style I
understand that but I absolutely love it
it's just a very thick black dress which
is good for fall and I know it looks
like when you were at a funeral right
now but I have a way of accessorizing
this and i love it has pockets which
instantly makes me love it and i
probably going to pair this with like
some lace tights a red floral necklace
like the j.crew one if you don't talking
about and then I have these like brown
boots which I am gonna mix brown and
black because I'm a rebel but I don't
think of you really cute for the fall
and I absolutely love it so that's all
the stuff I got from choice i will link
it down below it's a great little
boutique and i love it the next place i
went to is H&amp;amp;M and I got of course some
more button downs because I absolutely
love button downs a lot but the first
time I got is a flannel and I got this a
little bit big so I can wear with
leggings but it's just a green color and
it has pink stripes in it and it's super
comfortable and I just absolutely love
it I love flannels they're my favorite
thing to wear in the fall and winter
beside sweaters but they're so
comfortable and this one particular i
just loved it it was only like twenty
dollars and
Oh else about this button down shirt
which is wrinkly cuz I've already warned
it but it has kind of a tribal aztec
pattern like near the chest i guess and
then it just buttons down it's kind of a
denim color so i probably wear this with
black Jean very simple something that's
easy to put on you just look put
together that's why I love button downs
because you can literally just put on
jeans a buttoned down and like some
sandals or boots and you look like you
spent a lot of time in your outfit when
you leave you just kind of put on the
shirt so then I went to american eagle
and i just picked up a pair of jeggings
they look like this they're kind of a
light / dark mix I guess but they're
super stretchy as a pocket of like i
love american eagle jeans they're my
absolute favorite because they're so
comfortable and i needed a pair to wear
with my combat boots but definitely if
you're looking for some good comfortable
jeans american eagle is the place to go
so then while I was in Boston a while
back i went to brandy melville because i
had to because i've heard all this stuff
l training alone and just wanted to try
it I got this huge oversized sweater
which is my favorite sweater I oh now
it's just striped and it's very very big
and comfortable super soft it's just so
cozy and I love this and I'm born this
with leggings and jeans and I'm warning
scarves and I've worn it with a ton of
stuff and I just love it it's kind of a
new favorite staple sweater and I really
want more of these and then I also got a
bag from brandy melville it's a
crossbody bag and has a bunch of fringe
on it which I love it makes me feel like
a hippie even though I'm probably the
least hippie person there is suede
material and it's very small because I
don't keep a lot of stuff and I just
figured it'd be a nice cute little purse
to have because I usually just carry
around my fossil on but I decided to
shake it off with this shake it up shake
it up so recently I got a new stylehaul
manager and she's happy the cutest
little gift I decided to show because I
was so excited when I got this in the
mail but it comes in a little stylehaul
batch she wrote me a note measure super
sweet this is the flower are you kidding
me this is the former lipstick and the
color nude and it's just a basic nude
lipstick which I don't have but it looks
like that it's kind of a pinky nude so
it's absolutely pretty island I've never
tried this brand so
I was excited also got this lipgloss
from I think it's from zoo a but it's
called tender and it's just a nice
corally pink color and it's very smooth
already worn this it's not sticky at all
which is good for lip gloss because a
lot of times you can get really sticky
lip glosses I so got this nail polish in
home run is the minty green and it's
from pure eyes which I think they sell
it clears i believe or maybe but it's
very opaque and I've already warned it I
love it s on all these hair ties which
are creaseless so they don't make your
hair crease when you put it up in a
ponytail ways you never have I got this
three bird nest coupon and then a Jew
MIT gift card for twenty dollars which
i'm going to use because it has the most
pretty and unique jewelry knife always
wanted to try it so yeah that's
everything that I got so thank you so
much harm and I'm so excited to have a
new manager and this just made my day
when I opened it and then lastly from
kohls I just got a couple of nail
polishes to update my fall nail polish
collection because I don't have that
many fallen nail polishes but they're
both from SC because that's my favorite
nail polish company and the first one is
vested interest and it's kind of a
greenie gray color it's very interesting
it's very fall though it's kind of like
a muddy concrete color I feel like which
sounds really like not cute but it's
cute and then this one is my favorite
it's in after school boy blazer and it's
just a dark navy cobalt blue color and
it's so pretty it's a little bit purpley
to it's just literally beautiful and I
cannot wait to wear this on my toes says
everything is haul video I don't wasn't
too much or anything but I just decided
to share it with you guys um I hope you
