like they'll buy a ton of candles and
like never burn them I burn these every
day the first 1i have is pumpkin caramel
latte and it says this is a warm rich
blood of creamy pumpkin spiced caramel
and sweet cream and I don't smell
pumpkin I just smell like cream and
caramel I'm the person who likes the
really warm like bakery sense I'm not
into like cranberries like I smelt
leaves and I hated it I was like oh this

guys the Koch I've bird it's actually
doesn't look like that much but I find
this so much and I love it i also got
marshmallow fireside and i like this but
not as much just cuz it's not as strong
and i'm personally like super strong
like bakery sons and it says it is b2c

marshmallows and sumptuous vanilla cream
blend with the comforting aroma of rich
smoldering woods and yeah pretty much
feels like that um this is a much
lighter sent though like I've burned
