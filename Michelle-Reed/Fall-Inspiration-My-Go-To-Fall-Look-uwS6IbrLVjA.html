fall look video so this is basically my
essentials for fall actually showing you
guys how I wear them though how I use
the makeup products all that good stuff
before we start this intro if you don't
like long intros go ahead and skip to
this time because there are a few things
that I want to address before I get into
this video and I know a lot of people
hate long intros so you can just skip if
you're gonna go down in the comments and
complain about how long the intro is so
as you guys have probably noticed I have
not been uploading twice a week every
Sunday and Thursday like my schedule is
and the reason for that is because I am
currently applying to colleges and I
also applying for scholarships basically
my time has been dedicated to dads and I
know it stings it really really bugs me
not uploading twice a week I really wish
I could but right now my education kind
of has priority and I just cannot do
that schedule right now but in a couple
of months when I finish with all that
good stuff and all my scholarships and
whatnot I would definitely be back to
uploading twice a week and I cannot wait
for that honestly I miss uploading twice
a week a lot but just right now this has
to work because I am currently working
on that stuff and it's a little bit more
important right now if you're new to my
channel you should definitely subscribe
the button will be right here and it
will also be down below if you're on
your phone I would really really
appreciate that I upload every Thursday
not Sunday on Thursday now but I haven't
really appreciated so with all that
being said we're just going to go ahead
and get into the video so starting off
with makeup I am doing this look that I
wore my fall essentials video because a
ton of you guys requested it I'm
starting off with my L'Oreal Pro matte
foundation because I like to have a
matte finish in the fall time that's
just something that I think looks nice
for the full time and then I'm going in
with my boy concealer and I'm going to
be using this as a primer on my eyelids
because I don't really feel the need to
use primer this works just as well I
just set it with some translucent powder
and you are good to go first I am using
my cielo in the light palette and I'm
taking the shade bliss and I'm applying
this to my crease as a transition shade
I really like this color it's a nice
kind of warm tone crease color and then
I'm taking the kind of amber colored
bronze shade with a wet brush and I'm
applying this to my lid if it's wet it
applies a lot better and it just looks a
lot more vibrant so
I'm doing that and then I'm going back
in with that blue shade I'm applying
this over the crease again just to kind
of clean up the area I'm taking smog
from my naked palette I'm applying this
to my outer corner just to give the eye
look a little bit of definition and then
on the center of my lid to kind of the
outer edge I'm applying half-baked this
really makes the whole look pop and it
honestly just adds so much dimension
it's awesome
then I'm highlighting my brows with the
shade cream from my lorac Pro palette
I'm also smudging bliss on the lower
lash line this definitely just adds a
little bit of to the look and then I'm
also applying a little bit of smog to
the outer edge next I'm going in with my
Anastasia brow pencil and I haven't been
able to get my eyebrows waxed cuz I'm on
accutane so don't judge my brows I'm
just filling them in as much as I can
they are horrendous
I know I'm going in with my instant age
rewind brightener I'm applying this in a
V motion to clean up the eyeshadow a
little bit I think it definitely adds a
lot to the look and the brightener is
phenomenal I definitely recommend it and
then I'm setting this with my Rimmel
stay matte powder which I've used for
years and I swear by for bronzer i'm
using the hoola bronzer and i'm just
applying this kind of lightly i'm not
really focusing too much just to kind of
give my skin some bronze and some life
since i'm pretty pale then I'm using my
tan color blush palette from Coastal
Scents and using the kind of red shade
I'm applying this to my cheekbones then
I'm doing a little bit of eyeliner and
applying my covergirl LashBlast mascara
which is very old like I haven't used
this in forever but I've been loving it
recently and we're finishing off with
some Ribble Bordeaux which definitely
completes the look and that's it for
hair we are keeping it simple and I'm
adding some wave with my one-inch
curling iron from Hot Tools I do this
very loosely I barely even think about
it I just go through super quickly brush
out the curls and make sure they all
look nice and natural and then I'm
putting my hair up into a half-up
half-down style and then I am braiding
the ponytail area down and then
loosening it up I think this template
just adds a lot to your typical half up
half down hairstyle and I really like it
I've been doing it a lot lately
so this is what my typical fall outfit
looks like I will usually wear a chunky
sweater this one is from H&amp;amp;M it's kind
of cropped and it's a nice baby pink
color I love it and I also tucked it
into my jeans which are from American
Eagle and I paired it with a necklace
from Francesca's and my favorite booties
which are currently from Franco Sarto
they're awesome and yeah that's pretty
much my typical fall outfit so I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video I had a
ton of fun filming it as always I
absolutely love these hair makeup and
outfit videos I know a lot of people
don't do them anymore but they're
honestly my favorite I think there's so
much fun so you should also go watch my
last video it was do-it-yourself
Starbucks drinks because who doesn't
love false Starbucks drinks in my rights
so you should doubly go check out that
one and I'll see you guys my next idiom
