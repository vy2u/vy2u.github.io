loves tag I'm so excited for fall it's
not even funny I tried to film this
outside and I failed because the
lighting was terrible everywhere I went
I'm filming this again and I just went
to my room so I'm sorry guys I wanted to
be all cool and film outside but I
failed so I hope you can forgive me but
my shirt has many else on it like is
that adorable I don't know so the first
topic is five of your favorite fall
makeup products and i have a few to show
you guys the first one is a blush and
this is by elf or eyes lips face it's
from the studio line this is an mellow
mauve got purpley pink dark color with a
little bit of shimmer but not enough
that it's going to show up on your face
it's so smooth and creamy and it's just
really pretty and I really like this and
I feel like once you want to switch out
of your pink sand into like more mauve
colors this is really pretty next I have
a lip product by NYX and it is the soft
matte lip cream in Tokyo pink color
which I know is it fall related but I
really like this cuz it's matt and i
feel like fall lip colors are a lot more
stuff this stuff kinda diff they are
Matt and I really like this also it
smells like cupcakes like I'm not even
joking I really like this X I have a
foundation this is the Revlon Photoready
foundation love this because it's really
smooth but heavier coverage i have it on
right now and it's also a lighter color
so it's gonna fit me more any fall time
it also has a pump and it's a really
nice quality pump too so i really like
this I mean it's also if you are going
to take pictures this is great it has a
little bit of shimmer in it I don't know
if you'll be able to see on camera but
um doesn't like show up on your face so
you look glittery but when it takes a
picture um it's your skin look perfect
so it just it's good like this is one of
the maybelline color tattoo I the
shadows and bad to the bronze a shimmery
brown color it's a little bit darker
than I would usually go for but like in
the fall time when you just want
something that's a little bit more
dramatic I feel like this is really
and they're just really creamy and
really meant it like super pigmented and
yeah they just came out with a ton of
new colors for fall and I really want
the beige I think I really won't go
along and lastly I have a pallet this is
the two-faced natural eye palette or
just kidding this is the two-phase naked
eye palette and it has a bunch of cool
tone colors and I really like them it
has some matte ones it has some
shimmering once just has a good variety
and I really feel like it's a nice
palette so pretty and so pigmented and
just hand is like covered in swatches
but I really do like this for the fall
time I feel like all the colors are
really really pretty the next question
is your favorite fall hair product
honestly my hair and doesn't really
change for fall so I mean this is kind
of just year-round but act like it's for
fall and this is the Moroccan oil
treatments basically just like an oil
you put in your hair when it's dry or
wet it doesn't really matter i don't
think it's it really soft and really
silky and i just really like this um my
hairdresser actually gave this to me for
free free so I mean it's amazing what
can I say next question is your favorite
fall nail polish and I have to because
of course I couldn't choose one like
what is by area it's and champagne
shimmer it's like a bronzy shimmery
color so pretty like any was this this
and I have essays recessionista which is
like a purpley pink color it's a little
bit more dark for fall and I feel like
if you are into more fall colors this is
good next question is your favorite fall
scent and I know you're all expecting me
to pull out a perfume but it's a candle
what can I say it is the pumpkin caramel
latte and candle from Bath and Body
Works I got this at the 24 20 sale I
think yeah I got another one but I don't
like it as much and this smells like a
warm rich blend of creamy pumpkin spiced
caramel sweet cream mmm guys smell it
I'm just kidding i hate when people do
that but it smells so good if you're
into more like vanilla caramel rich
sense you'll love this
next question is your most worn fall
accessory in clothing item so for
accessory I love scarves it's from urban
outfitters it's like a huge chunky knit
scarf it's black and has like taupe
little dots and it's just so cute it's
an infinity scarf to you just look so
cute and they're just cute to bundle up
with and yeah I love this clothing item
mine would be boots and this is a pair
of steve madden boots or as tall haven't
worn these yet because i can't it's like
100 degrees outside but like dark wash
skinny jeans and like a sweater and then
you're off it looks really cute so why
not now there are five fall random
questions so the first one is who is
your favorite fall style icon and
honestly I don't have one cuz I don't
like base my style off other people
number two is if you're going to a corn
maze what do you wear first of all I
don't know what a corn maze is I think
it's one like people chase you chainsaws
correct me if I'm wrong but I think
that's what they're talking about it
would wear boots like ugg boots jeans
and a hoodie or three is your favorite
Halloween movie and mine would be
charlie brown and the great pumpkin just
because it's classic like me I watch it
every Halloween when we're like eating
our candy number four is your favorite
Halloween candy and mom would probably
be just anything Sour like sour patch
kids or sour straws I don't really like
candy corn I think it's nasty lastly
number five is what are you being for
halloween I'm being myself cuz I'm gonna
stay at home and hand out candy I know
I'm being boring but I don't know I just
think I'm too old dress up like I know I
don't have any like Halloween parties to
go to yet so that was the end of my
fault loves tag I tagged all of you guys
to do this and put it as a video
response now i will put who I tagged
right here like specifically will
probably only be like two people because
I've no YouTube friends but yeah I love
you guys and by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
