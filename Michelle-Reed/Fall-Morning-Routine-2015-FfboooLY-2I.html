watching a follow up morning routine
which is actually a collab with Nina and
Rihanna who are the most positive upbeat
twin sisters you will ever watch so I
will have their fall morning routine
links right here also with their channel
will be down below as well but you
should definitely check out their video
and their channel I've been obsessed
with them for the past like six months
or so they're so awesome they do just
really positive routine videos Q&amp;amp;A is
just like fun videos to watch so
definitely link them down below check
them out
and if you happen to be from their
channel you should definitely subscribe
I upload every Thursday and I do these
beauty fashion lifestyle videos so you
definitely subscribe the button will be
right here and down below and I really
appreciate that and with all that being
said we're just gonna go ahead and get
into the video so usually I start the
day with a text from my boyfriend Gunnar
and it's usually something goofy like
this it's a great start to my day I love
it
and then I will catch up on my YouTube
videos in my subscription box and I will
just kind of chill for about 30 minutes
and then I will finally decide you know
what it's time to get up and I will get
out of my bed and since it's fall I get
to wear these super cute plaid pj pants
which are my favorite right now and then
I will light my favorite fall candle
which is this autumn one and put up my
window because it's been feeling very
good in Texas lately it's not super hot
and then I will go wash my face and I
will moisturize I always like to start
off my day with some skincare just to
get my skin healthy and glowy and ready
for the makeup that I will apply later
on and of course I have to brush my
teeth because it's very important and
then I will go below my nose because the
fall time makes my allergies horrendous
then it's time to greet my dog Roxy I
usually spend like 10 minutes with her
in the morning because she is adorable
and guys I've said this before but I'm
obsessed with her she's my favorite then
I will drink a little bit of water I've
been trying to drink water before
drinking coffee
the morning because it's definitely
better for you and then I'll just go
ahead and make a cup of coffee I just do
a French Roast and I'll add a little bit
of milk and sugar and then I will drink
this while I do my makeup so for my
makeup I'm not gonna go into detail
where the products will be listed down
below so I'll usually start off with a
little bit of foundation and then I will
fill in my brows and today I went for
kind of a deeper autumn I look I really
like it though but this isn't really
everyday this is just maybe once a week
or so so I just did that I applied some
concealer blended that in set it with
some powder added mascara and eyeliner
did some bronzer some blush and then a
little bit of a dark lipstick and that
was it for my fall look for my hair a
lot of you guys wanted to know how I did
this low bun in my last video so
basically I just gather my hair at the
nape of my neck and I will kind of pull
the hair apart until I like how it looks
and then I'll just secure with bobby
pins and a hair tie loosen it up loosen
the hair in the front and that's it it's
really easy and messy and cute and then
it's about time for breakfast so I will
eat some honey bunches of oats cereal
and then some peanut butter and apples
I'm not very fancy with my breakfast I'm
too lazy to like actually make something
so this usually does the job for my
outfit today I wore something a little
fancier than usual but my top is from
Urban Outfitters and my skirt is from
H&amp;amp;M which these skirts have been so in
lately and then my tights are also from
H&amp;amp;M and I'm wearing my favorite pointed
booties from Steve Madden but yeah this
is something that I usually wear on a
fall day but maybe a little more done up
so I really hope you guys enjoyed this
fall morning routine video I love
morning routines they're my favorite to
film also don't forget to go check out
Mia and Rihanna's video it'll be linked
down below if you want to watch my last
video it was 8 ways to have a better day
and I really liked it I thought that it
was very helpful and you guys seemed to
enjoy it too so definitely check out
that video subscribe and I'll see you
guys my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
