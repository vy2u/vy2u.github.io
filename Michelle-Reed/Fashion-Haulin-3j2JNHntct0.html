spring kind of haul video I went
shopping with my sisters and my mom and
I got a few things I didn't get too many
things but i decided to haul it for you
guys i'm also filming outside today
might be a little crazy i don't know i
just decided to change things up and
yeah let's get started so the first
place I went was american eagle and i
don't really shop there too often but we
had like a forty percent off coupon so I
decided to I got this pair of sandals
and they'll kind of like a copper rose
gold color and I figured they'd match
with a lot of stuff and they were really
cute and I needed new sandals cuz when I
really worn out so yeah I'm also gonna
put like the prices somewhere so i don't
have to say them because I don't really
know the price I also figured out that
American Eagles sold like chino pants so
I bought a pair and I really like them
they're just kind of Korra you have
almost like an econ pattern on them but
they're really skinny and then I'm just
gonna cuff them and I thought these were
really cute and summery they're not very
thick they're very thin material so
they're not gonna like be really hot or
anything I also purchased a tank top and
it's kind of like a teal minty color and
it's just looks like this and its really
really soft almost like a burnout and
it's just really comfortable and i
figured i would wear this with a lot of
different things so i just got that also
from american eagle i got a pair of
sunglasses they look like this I gotta
put them on yes so they look like this
they're just really really simple and
actually see now but they're just like a
tortoiseshell and they're really simple
and I just like simple sunglasses and
then I got one thing from urban
outfitters and it's just one of these
crop top and the bottom has a really
pretty like eyelet lace pattern at the
bottom and wear this with the skirt them
about to show you to a brunch and it was
really cute and i really like it has a
somewhat just as a silver zipper in the
back and it's a cream color this is
really cute really summery aim yeah from
forever 21 I got a high-low skirt which
I'm not really like a huge fan of high
low but this one was really pretty so a
blush lace color and so it has like the
skirt in the front and then it trails
down into this really pretty lacy bottom
but yeah it's just a hi low and it's a
really cute really simple very springy
and I got this for around twenty dollars
and I thought it was cheap I really
really like it so then I got a pair of
wedges from target and I don't really
buy really expensive shoes because I
don't really wear really fancy shoes all
that often so I just bought this
pair of wedges they're really simple
they look like this they're just a brown
wedge and has like the watcher there
they're just brown and natural and they
match with a lot of things so these were
only like twenty dollars so i figured i
would go ahead and buy them and they're
really cute they just have like a bronze
buckle and really simple they do hurt a
little bit because I'm not used to heels
I don't wear heels of school not one of
those kids and I really like him so we
also just had my drill team banquet and
my big sis got me a few things so I
decided to show y'all um you got me a
few headbands and I really like them
they're just kind of braided and they
have little like gold chains the rum
they're really cute really pretty and
yeah I don't really know how to wear
these but I'll figure it out she also
got anything is really pretty pair of
like dangly earrings which I don't
really wear that often but I wore these
to the brunch and I really likes them
they're just kind of a turquoise and
gold color and they're really kind of
bohemian and they're really pretty so
that is everything that i bought i hope
this video wasn't too crazy being
outside um hey James James didn't hear
me I hope you guys enjoyed this and I'll
see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
