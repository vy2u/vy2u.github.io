doing these stripped-down challenge
which is the video that I've wanted to
do for a while I just love the idea of
being able to sit down and one cut and
just spit out a bunch of thoughts and
you know that's the video and that's
what I have planned for today
I honestly don't have anything planned
about what I'm gonna talk about so this
could be a disaster there's a great
chance that it could be disaster because
if you don't know have this challenge
you can't edit it's all in one take
basically the spin-off of a cena's
social media video about her quitting
and just kind of a response to that but
I've seen these videos go in a lot of
different directions like literally
every possible direction so I think it's
more just you know talk about what
YouTube has meant to you talk about
things that are going on your life and
yeah that's kind of the gist of it I
guess I'll start with responding to a
Cena's quitting social media video
because that's kind of the reason why
this came up and what YouTube meant to
me so we're just gonna camp out there
for a sec I have very mixed feelings
about her video I had watched her a lot
previously I was actually really
fascinated by veganism for about a year
I was like obsessed with watching what I
eat in a day videos and all that stuff
and so I really really enjoyed her
videos and then she posted that one and
just everything kind of changed I agree
with her I agree some people find
validation from social media and some
people don't really think it's a
positive environment and then some
people do and there's no point in me
just sitting here and talking about why
I love social media well that's kinda
what I'm gonna do but um I want to make
the point that everyone has different
opinions and that's okay it's okay that
she didn't like social media that's fine
we don't need to attack her for that
that I was just very uncalled for and I
never want to just point the finger at
someone because everyone has different
reactions to things and that's okay cuz
that's the world we live in but at the
same time YouTube has just been the most
incredible thing for me I can't even put
into words how much I love it and how
much it means to me I think when people
find out that I do YouTube they're like
is the girl
that makes youtube videos like that's
cool but for me it's so much more it's
it's just so awesome and I school I was
senior in high school if you don't know
I never really found the place that I
fit I guess always on a really
independent person and also a very
driven person I'm the kind of person
that's constantly doing something I'm
constantly filming constantly editing
constantly doing my homework constantly
insert verb because I just feel like
life is too short to just waste away the
day and I think for me I find purpose
and working really hard on something and
working you know on YouTube and such and
so YouTube was just always that place
for me that creative outlet right just
go to and I could enjoy creating videos
and putting out content that I was
passionate about that was the main thing
it was never like numbers or subscribers
or anything I genuinely started this
because I loved creating videos I was
more fascinated by the film side of it
that was actually what I was gonna do in
college but that switched quite abruptly
in the past like month or so so yeah
YouTube has just been awesome and for
someone who never really found their
place in school YouTube is just the
greatest thing and for me I feel like
school is very formulaic you know you're
taught this is how you write this is how
you read and I know there are exceptions
there are very artsy creative classes
but I never found myself in those
classes I just felt like it was all do
this do this and no creativity
whatsoever and so for me YouTube was
like this beacon of hope of a Michelle
you can create a video all by yourself
and there are no rules you can just have
fun and that was the most attractive
part of YouTube for me and I love it so
much also being able to work at a young
age is really cool I've always been the
kind of person that enjoys working a lot
and for me it's never like oh man I have
to
this video or oh man I need a plan out
my next month of videos because it's fun
I enjoy it I sit down and I'll sit down
for hours upon hours and I'll be like I
have been sitting here for 10 hours
editing this but it's so much fun like I
don't want to stop and that happiness
that I get from YouTube is real and it's
honestly the reason why I do it so yeah
social media has it's bad sides yeah it
can be annoying a lot and getting hate
comments after you spent hours upon
hours on the video isn't the most
encouraging thing in the world it's
worth it especially worth it for the 90%
of positive comments that I get from you
guys it just it means a lot to me I feel
like we live in a world where we're
constantly like you know I want this I
need this I don't have that I constantly
need more and we don't sit back and
truly thank people and don't truly point
keep you up point PP out point people
out whenever they're helping us or
whenever you mean a lot to us even on
Thanksgiving I felt like I wasn't really
that thankful it's just like the day of
Thanksgiving and I'm gonna post this
tweet that I'm thankful but I'm not
truly thankful and that was part of the
reason why I wanted to film this I don't
think you guys know how much you mean to
me and how much YouTube means to me um
just the fact that God gave you this
opportunity to make these videos make
money off of them which it's definitely
very controversial I know a lot of
people think YouTube isn't a real job
you know YouTube shouldn't count ever
someone comment on one of my videos a
while back and I don't normally get
offended by hate comments just because I
know that my purpose and I get my
confidence through God and I don't need
it through other people's approval this
one for some reason just kind of drove
me crazy someone said that I needed to
get a real job because YouTube wasn't a
job and I just kind of sat there and I
laughed a little on the inside because I
don't think people realize how much of a
job YouTube is however you want to
define job you know I'm editing I'm
finding music I'm filming I'm cleaning
out videos I'm talking
to other companies you know there's so
many other jobs that go with in one job
like I'm literally doing ten jobs as a
17 year old and that's awesome I'm not
complaining about that because I love
that that's the reason why I love you
too but for me it is a job but it's a
job that I enjoy and I don't think we
should discourage people whenever they
have a job that may seem you know more
glamorous and that's because yeah people
will get upset that I get free stuff and
yeah I don't get it sex you're like you
get paid this much just because you put
this product in a video and I'm like
yeah but the thing is you don't know how
much work actually went behind that
product placement and you don't know the
research I went through it's not as
simple as it seems and it's not as
glamorous as it seems not to say that it
isn't fun because it is but that's
always a comment that kind of irks you
but yeah just the fact that YouTube is
my job is absolutely incredible I love
it I was actually watching Brooke and
she owes what is this called
stripped-down challenge video and she
was talking about how much better
College was than high school and that
just encouraged me because I don't know
if you guys know this but I'm not the
biggest fan of high school I've never
been I wouldn't miss it
I try to figure out like where I'm in
focused I think it's here I wouldn't
really consider myself like high school
is my prime because I've never been a
school person I've never really fit in
with classes and sports and all that
stuff so College I'm really hoping it's
just gonna be a stronger point to my
life because right now high school isn't
the best and I'm definitely ready for it
to be over yeah so that's something that
I wanted to talk about just not
necessarily finding my place not to say
that like I'm this kid who's always
alone that by myself which is okay but
that's not me I mean I have friends but
it's just never been an enjoyment for me
being in high school it's just something
that I go through and then I get out at
1 o'clock and I'm like it's YouTube time
and
I love it so I just want to say that I'm
so thankful for YouTube and I'm so
grateful for and I know a lot of people
say that's changing in ways that is not
the best or they don't agree with but
the thing is our world is ever-changing
it is constantly changing media
especially has to change it has to keep
up with the times and how well we
adopted those changes shows are what's
all right I'm looking forward now how
good of a person we are but I think that
shows how strong you are how you can
keep your I am so out of lots of words
and I want to cut this out but I can't
try to say that it shows your true ethic
I don't even turn to say uh we're just
gonna scratch an idea I'm so sorry I
can't believe I'm putting this on the
internet but yeah media is ever-changing
things change and that's just how the
world works it especially me when people
who are older than us will say you know
my generation we didn't have all these
phones and Technology and social media
because for me social media is such a
powerful tool for so many positive
things it's not this negative thing I
mean yeah it has negative aspects I
uploaded a whole video about how we're
too obsessed with our phones but you
know past all that it's such a good
platform and I couldn't imagine my life
without it yeah that's like bad to say I
couldn't imagine my life without social
media but I couldn't because YouTube is
incredible and for me it's the
creativity aspect that I love and just
having this platform say what I want to
create what I want be what I want to be
the person that
you know I want it to be not that it's
different than Who I am because it is
the same as Who I am but it's pretty
much everything that I wanted to say I
really hope you guys enjoyed this let me
know your thoughts down below mainly
just wanted to do this video to say
thank you because you guys are
incredible of me I know a lot of these
videos have been sad which is fine
but for me YouTube is just such an
amazing thing and I'm so grateful for it
and I pray to God every day and I'm just
like thank you God for giving you this
opportunity because it's absolutely
incredible and if you ever want to make
a youtube channel holla at your girl and
I will help you because it is the best
decision I ever made and I would
recommend it to anyone I'll see you guys
