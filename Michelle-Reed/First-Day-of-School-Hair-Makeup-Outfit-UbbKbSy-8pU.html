back to school first day here make up an
outfit video so I really hope you guys
like this so like always we're gonna be
starting off with the makeup look it's
very simple and pretty natural so I'm
starting off with my bare skin and I'm
going to be using my Porefessional
primer to fill in my face and get rid of
any large pores well not get rid of them
but minimize them next I'm using my
Garnier rollerball which I love because
it has caffeine in it to wake you up
because I know the night before the
first day of school you probably told
yourself to go to bed two hours earlier
but then you really couldn't so you
ended up watching Netflix tool 2 a.m. so
I'm just applying this underneath my
eyes and I'm blending it in with my
little sponge to give a more natural
finish and then for a little more
coverage on going in with a cream
concealer and I'm applying this
underneath my eyes and to any blemishes
and of course we have got to set this
all with our Rimmel stay matte powder
next I'm using my Benetint cheek tint to
give more of a natural glow to our
cheeks and of course you've got to fill
in those brows so I'm just filling them
in with some gel and a little bit of
powder I'm using my favorite palette
which is this Stila in the light palette
and I'm using kitten all over my lid and
then kind of a topi color in my crease
and then a dark brown color in the outer
corners so very very simple very neutral
and we have got to blend this all out so
I'm using my blending brush to blend it
and I'm applying some Brown eyeliner but
you guys know I can't do this on camera
and I'm also gonna curl my eyelashes and
apply my rocket mascara for lips I'm
using a pinky nude lipstick it's
actually called pinky nude and I'm
applying this to my lips and then using
a little bit of a coral gloss to the
center of my lips to give the illusion
of bigger lips and that's it for the
makeup now we are on to the very simple
hair as well so first I'm brushing out
my hair and I seem to have a little
trouble right here then I am just
sectioning off my hair and taking my hot
tools 1 inch curling iron I am wrapping
my hair around the barrel for about 5
seconds and letting go so it's very
simple it kind of gives these soft wavy
curls so don't really think about it too
much just kind of curl and let the curls
happen and we're just gonna replace a
clip really fast for a sec now I
wouldn't usually use heat on my hair
everyday for school but since it is the
first day I'm gonna put in a little more
effort than I usually do and that's it
for the hair
you can and now we are on to my favorite
parts which is the outfit now I don't
know about you guys but I usually have
my outfit planned like months in advance
for my first day of school but every
time I pick it out I always end up
hating it the morning on my first day of
school so then I have to go back into my
closet and find another outfit which you
girls know is a struggle
then after trying on my whole entire
closet I usually find something that I
end up liking
so for this outfit I am wearing a very
pretty kind of striped peplum top which
is from choies which I'll link down
below and then my jeans are just these
American Eagle jeggings from American
Eagle obviously and then my Oxford's are
from t.j.maxx my backpack is from brandy
melville talked to my sisters and my
necklace is from Jay simple and then my
ring is from brandy melville
so that is it for my first day of school
hair make up an outfit video I really
hope you guys have a great first day of
school and make sure let me know what
other back to school videos you'd like
to see make sure to go follow my
instagram and twitter they will both be
linked down below like so itself
