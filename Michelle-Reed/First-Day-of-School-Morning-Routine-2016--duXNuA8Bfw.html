you're new to my channel you should
definitely subscribe I upload twice a
week but today I'm going to be doing a
first day of school morning routine not
actually going to be a freshman in
college so I'm not living at home but
this is going to be if I were and like
tips that I think help for first day of
school you're a new school or you're
just nervous all that kind of stuff
these are kind of my top tips for that
and I really hope they help you
definitely like this video if you're
going back to school soon and leave a
comment down below letting me know when
you go back to school because I'm super
interested and that's pretty much all I
have to say for this intro and I really
hate long interest let's just go ahead
and get into the video so on the first
day of school I usually like to wake up
a little bit earlier just so I have more
time to get ready and look nice and not
be stressed out because being stressful
getting ready is the absolute worst and
so I usually wake up at around 6:30 to
7:00 depending on when you start school
and then I like to go and wash my face
because I think starting with skincare
is really important and it really wakes
me up so I just like to use a facial
cleanser and then I'm using my origins
original skin essence I love this stuff
it makes my skin really soft not
sponsored or anything I just really love
this product and I think it's awesome
and it's really helped cleared up my
skin and then after that I will usually
hop in the shower after brushing my
teeth um I usually like to take my
showers at night but I find on the first
day of school I needed something to
energize me and just to kind of refresh
my mind and so taking my shower in the
morning is also really nice then I put
on my super fluffy robe which I love and
I go grab some coffee I think it's
really nice just to have a glass of
water or tea or for me coffee because
I'm addicted while getting ready I just
think it kind of wakes me up as well
before you know eating breakfast I also
like to turn on some music just to kind
of pump me up I have a playlist called
go to vibes and I love these songs for
makeup I'm using my vino positively
radiant moisturizer I think it's super
nice and then my boots number 7 airbrush
foundation it's super lightweight if
you're someone who doesn't like to wear
a lot of makeup and then I'm filling in
my brows with my name
get shadow and then using my gimme brow
over top and then I am just neutralizing
my lids with my Maybelline instant age
rewind concealer and then I'm taking
this peach shade for my Kat Von D
palette and I'm applying this to my
crease and then I'm taking the kind of
rust color and I'm putting that over top
of the crease to define it a little bit
and then I'm highlighting with the cream
shade using my Maybelline instant age
rewind concealer I'm applying this in a
V motion underneath my eye since I have
pretty dark circles and I am just baking
that with a setting powder this really
helps make your concealer last all day
you just leave it there for about five
minutes and then wipe it off while this
is baking I like to use my Kat Von D
eyeliner and I'm just applying a little
bit of eyeliner and I'm brushing away
all of that powder using the peach
eyeshadow that I used earlier I'm
applying this underneath my lower lash
line and then I'm taking that rest color
again I'm applying it in the outer lower
lashline and curling my lashes and
applying my rocket mascara I love this
mascara it is awesome and I really
really like the combo of this eye shadow
look then I am applying my hoola bronzer
to my hollows of my cheeks and then also
my forehead a little bit and I'm using a
coral blush and I'm applying this to the
apples of my cheeks and onward and then
i'm using a highlighter this is mac soft
and gentle I love this highlighter
really really makes my skin look glowy
and then I am just using this lipstick
which is 104 from Rimmel the Kate Moss
collection and I'm setting everything
with my Smashbox photo finish primer and
that's it for the super natural look on
the first day if you want to do
something a little bit nicer to your
hair I really like adding waves with a
hair straightener basically I just flip
the straightener a little bit at an
angle towards the end of my hair and you
get this really nice just casual wave so
it's not like you curled your entire
head but it looks super natural in just
a little bit you know more done up for
the first day if you're like me and like
to kind of dress up a little bit more
and so I really really like this
hairstyle I don't even use hair spray I
just let it fall naturally and it's
beautiful and soft and it's my go-to one
I also like to pick up my outfit the
night before so I'm not stressed out and
trying to frantically decide what to
wear the
the first day of school for breakfast
I'm just having some avocado toast
because it is a classic I really like to
make sure I'm nourished especially on
the first day of school because you
might be nervous and it just helps
whenever you have a full stomach I also
added a banana and some raisins because
I'm in like a raisin phase right now and
I really really like them but that's all
I had for my breakfast this is what I
like to wear for the first day of school
I think it's really nice wearing like a
casual comfy dress but adding tennis
shoes so it makes it more casual not so
dressy this dress is from Urban
Outfitters it's one of my favorites I'll
have it linked down below it's actually
on sale right now so definitely check it
out my watch is from fossil I love it
and then I'm wearing my favorite
all-white high-top converse which are my
go-to shoes right now so that's it for
my very casual outfit and it's
definitely one of my favorites
