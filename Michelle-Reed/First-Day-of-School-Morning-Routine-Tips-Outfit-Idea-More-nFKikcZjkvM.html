between their cross I will send them up
a message I send a message stick it I'll
get it
since we
hi guys today I'm here to do a video all
about how to have the ideal first day of
school morning routine all from like
what's eat for breakfast what's a good
outfit how to not faint walking into the
school because you're nervous all that
stuff that's really essential to know
for the first day of school if you
happen to be new to my channel which if
you are hello my name is Michelle I'm so
happy you stumbled across this video I
upload every Sunday and Thursday you
should definitely subscribe you can hit
the button right here if you're on a
computer or it's down below if you are
on your phone and I'd love to have you
here parts of my family also I would
love to know when you guys go back to
school so leave that in the comments
below because I'm a little bit
interested so think that's everything
that I have to say for this intro and I
hope you guys enjoy and let's just go
ahead and get into the video so on the
first day of school I would definitely
recommend waking up early enough to
where you can get ready and I'll be
stressed out and let's face it you
probably won't wake up like this
sometimes I walk a little faster than
ha we just again
you're going to be tired there is no
doubt so what I like to do is head on
into the bathroom and splash some very
cold water on my face to wake myself up
just because I'm probably not used to
waking up this early
and I'll also brush my teeth I would
also recommend taking your shower at
night so you don't have to waste time in
the morning and you can sleep in a
little longer and I like to go make
myself some coffee because I like to
drink coffee while I do my makeup but if
you don't like coffee you can have tea
or even some water to hydrate yourself
so then I like to go and turn on some
music because upbeat music just makes me
really happy I was listening to new
politics here and then I will do my
makeup on the first day of school I like
to do something a little more intense
and I would normally do for everyday
wear but I actually have a whole video
about middle school and high school
makeup tutorials so definitely check
that out it'll be linked here and down
below then for hair I just wanted to do
some soft waves so I put my hair into a
messy middle part and then I took my hot
tools one-inch curling iron and did very
loose waves with pretty big pieces of
hair just like you get a more natural
look but still looks like I put in some
effort I then like to shake my hair and
then add some hairspray to add some
volume and that's it for this very
simple hairstyle
I would also recommend picking out your
outfit the night before so you can avoid
that stressful I do not know what to
wear feeling because it is the worst
poor breakfast I like to make a smoothie
I will usually add a fresh banana some
frozen fruits a few fresh strawberries
some milk and then some honey and I
don't know about you guys but smoothies
alone don't really fill me up so I like
to eat something as well with it I had
some peanut butter honey toast which if
you've never done that before definitely
try it add some honey and it is very
good and it's a very nourishing
breakfast because on the first day of
school you don't want to have an empty
stomach and be the only kid whose
stomach is growling in class because we
have all been there
you will probably be nervous on the
first day of school so just keep your
head up and put your shoulders back and
walk in with confidence and just pretend
like you got this going on and you are
happy and smile at people and you will
have a great day so for my outfit I'm
wearing this best from Francesca's which
I know may not be in everyone's dress
code but it was 105 outside and it was
pretty hot so I paired this with a tank
top from H&amp;amp;M and I really like this
combo I mean again it might not be good
for everyone school but it doesn't
exactly show all of your shoulders so my
jeans are from American Eagle and then
my favorite part of this outfit which is
the shoes are from Urban Outfitters and
I love these they're so dainty and cute
and they make me feel really classy when
I wear them so that is it for my outfits
and this video so like always I really
hoped you guys enjoyed this video I have
a lot of fun making it and I really hope
you guys have good first day of schools
because it is the new year it is a new
school year and it is time to take it on
and make good grades make the friends
and just have
time if you'd like to watch another one
of my back to school videos I actually
just uploaded to makeup tutorials for
middle schoolers and high schoolers so
you should definitely watch that one if
you want to know what to put on your
face and what not and yeah I'll see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
