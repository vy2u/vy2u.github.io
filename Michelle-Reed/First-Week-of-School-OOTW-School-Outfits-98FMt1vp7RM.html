quick intro before we get into this
video basically this video is showing
you guys four outfits that I would wear
for back-to-school or for the first week
of school I tend to dress like this all
throughout the school year so but
however it applies to you I really hope
this gives you guys some ideas on what
you can wear for school because I think
we all know the struggle of being in our
closet not knowing what to wear and I
don't want you guys to have to go
through them if you're new to my channel
and you like what you see definitely
subscribe you can click below or the
link right here the little button right
here and I would really appreciate that
also I want to know if there's only four
outfits because I had to get this up by
Thursday so I could film another one
while I was at school because I would
have time so that's why there were four
outfits I'm really sorry about that and
with all that being said we're gonna go
ahead and get into the outfit of the
week so this first outfit is very chic
and it's something I would totally wear
to school my top is from Madewell my
necklace is from Francesca's and I'm
wearing some dark wash jeans from
American Eagle and then my purse is from
Italy so I have no idea what brand it is
and I'm also wearing Steve Madden
booties my watch is from a brand called
Daniel Wellington I'll have it linked
down below I also have a 15% off code
that you can check out but it's so well
made and so classy and I thought it just
fit the outfit perfectly and I've been
obsessed with it so I'll have it down
below you know this is totally something
I would wear to school it'd give me the
confidence I need but it's so casual and
comfortable
so Tuesday's outfit is a little more
dressy but the dress is super
comfortable so I don't really think it
is the dress is from PacSun I love the
stripe design these are really popular
right now and then my necklace is from
Francesca's and I'm wearing the same
purse I wore in the last outfit from
Italy and then my shoes are just these
really cute open Oxford's I got them
from TJ Maxx and that's pretty much it
for the outfit and I paired it with a
really pretty kind of berry lip cuz I
thought it just tied the whole look
together since it was lacking some color
so this outfit is definitely my favorite
and I think it's the most me outfit if I
can say my top is from hmm and then I'm
wearing this kind of tie-dye cardigan
which I actually got at Marshalls for
like seven dollars which was awesome my
jeans are the same American Eagle ones
that I wore in the first outfit and then
my necklace is from Francesca's and then
I'm wearing the same booties from the
first outfit as well just because I
really like them and then I also wore
the Daniel Wellington watch because it
honestly matches with all of my clothes
and it just adds a simple touch to all
my outfits so that's it for this one
for the last outfit I am wearing this
top from Anthropologie I love the
turtleneck on it it honestly just makes
me feel very classy and sophisticated I
know all of you guys can't wear tank
tops but this one I would say is a
little bit more modest because the
straps are thicker my necklace is from
Madewell and I'm wearing the same jeans
again I know I wear jeans all the time I
repeat them it's okay and then my shoes
are from Urban Outfitters but that's it
pretty last outfit I think it's very
comfortable again yet very classy so I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
I had a ton of fun making it I really
liked how it turned out and I think it
was a little different than what I
usually do so really hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you guys are in
the mood for some more back to school
videos I posted one about all the stuff
in my backpack for what I carry so you
should definitely check out that one and
I'll have all my other back to school
videos linked down below and I'll see
you guys my next video which will be
Sunday bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
