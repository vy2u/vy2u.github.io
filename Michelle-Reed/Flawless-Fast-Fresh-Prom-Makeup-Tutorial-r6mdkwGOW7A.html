be showing you guys how to get this very
simple and clean prom look using clinic
products this video is made in
collaboration with Lord &amp;amp; Taylor to help
bring you guys the easiest most
efficient prom look which I know all of
you guys are looking for all of these
products can be purchased at your local
Lauren Taylor counter so let's just go
ahead and get into the look so to start
off this look I am using my Clinique
super balanced makeup and silk shel I'm
using this as a canvas for the rest of
my makeup I love this foundation because
it's really really natural-looking but
you don't really feel it but at the same
time you get really really great
coverage and the shade just fits me
perfectly so I've been loving this
foundation for step two I am using the
Clinique cheek pop in the shade pink pop
it's the prettiest bright pink with a
little bit of shimmer I just apply this
right at the apples of my cheeks because
it gives a really really subtle glow and
since it is so bright it just adds life
to your face which I really like for
step three I'm using my favorite clinic
chubby highlight stick and hefty
highlight on my cheekbones my chin and
my nose my forehead it gives a prettiest
shimmer especially in pictures which is
great for prom for mascara I'm going
simple with the eyes and I'm applying
the flutter to full mascara and black
onyx it really really lengthens my
eyelashes and it just really finishes
off the look and it doesn't smudge it
which is also great for prom and then
lastly I'm keeping it simple with lips
and I'm just using my Clinique hot matte
lipstick in the shade peony pop and I'm
applying this to my lips since
everything else is so neutral I like to
go bright on the lips I think it really
just completes the look and this
lipstick lasts all night and that is it
for my Clinique prom makeup tutorial
make sure to check out your local Lord &amp;amp;
Taylor counter for a flawless and fast
you time service for prom I hope you
guys enjoyed love you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
