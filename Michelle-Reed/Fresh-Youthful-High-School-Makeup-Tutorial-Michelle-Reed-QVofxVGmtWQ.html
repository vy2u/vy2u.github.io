hi guys today I'm here to do this very
fresh face and youthful makeup tutorial
I really love this look I do this pretty
much every day for highschool and I love
it of course you don't have to be in
high school to do this I just think it
is very age-appropriate but honestly
it's so Universal and it works for
everyone if you're new to my channel you
should definitely subscribe I upload
once or twice a week and I'd love for
you to stay on my channel and watch my
videos mean the world to me and so with
all that being said we're going to go
ahead and get into the makeup look so
I'm starting off with moisturizing my
skin with my ultra Repair lotion this is
from first aid beauty I love it
moisturizes your skin is so important to
obtain really glowy and fresh skin then
I'm using my photo finish primer from
Smashbox it's the light one just to
ensure my makeup stays on all day for
foundation I am using my naked skin
foundation it's super light and it looks
so natural so if you're looking for a
natural foundation I definitely suggest
this one and then I'm taking my instant
aged or white brightening concealer and
I'm applying this pretty generously just
because I've pretty dark under eyes and
I'm also going ahead and concealing my
eyes to use as primer for eyeshadow to
bring some light onto my face I'm using
my magic lumi highlighter this really
just highlights my face and I like to
put it in a V motion underneath my eyes
just again bring some more light on my
face and then I'm setting everything
with my Rimmel stay matte powder just
doing it lightly so you still get the
glowy effects for brows I'm lightly
filling them in with my Anastasia brow
pencil I basically draw in my arch and
then I put a diagonal line going down
just making them really natural I don't
have the best eye brows I know but I'm
filling them in in a natural manner and
then I'm using my hoola bronzer to
bronze my skin I basically just do it on
my cheekbones and then on my forehead to
bring some warmth in my face because I'm
quite pale and then I'm using my BEC
abhe tint in guava I love this it is so
natural looking and I've been obsessed
with it it's so good for spring and it's
a really pretty peachy pink color and
then after that I'm taking my Mac
highlight and soft and gentle and I'm
applying this to my cheekbones because
we want to have very glowy and fresh
skin and that highlight rocks for eyes
I'm using my Maybelline Color tattoo in
bold gold just to kind of prime
them and then I'm applying my Mac
highlight soft and gentle yes a
highlight but it works really really
well and then I'm using Urban Decay
Naked in the crease and then kind of in
the outer crease I'm applying buck just
to define the eyes really simple eye
shadow and then I'm highlighting with
white from my lorac Pro palette I'm
lightly very lightly lining my eyes with
my Urban Decay glide on pencil it's the
brown matte shade to make my eyes look
bigger i am lighting my eyes with a
white eyeliner just on my waterline this
really opens up your eyes for mascara I
am using my Maybelline lash sensational
mascara honestly not a huge fan of this
I'm just recently trying it out and then
I'm applying my beg of each tint to my
lips again just to give a very natural
flushed look to my lips then I'm setting
everything with my Smashbox photo finish
primer to lock everything in and that is
it for the makeup super fresh youthful
and glowy so I really hope you guys
