video which I haven't done for a while
so I decided to do one this is all about
freshman advice so freshman in high
school which is ninth grade if you don't
know it's like the first year of high
school you may be wondering why this is
up so early and like I'm sure already
talking about school it's because some
of my viewers go back to school at the
beginning of August and even the end of
July so I don't want to miss out with
them so that's why I did this so early
so without further ado let's go ahead
and get started first I'm going to be
talking about my freshman year
experience and all that good stuff and
then I'm going to go in to some
questions that you guys asked on my
Instagram and I'm going to answer those
so my freshman year overall I wanted to
do this so my freshman year was still
fresh in my mind and I want to say that
I loved freshman year it was so much
better than their old school in middle
school I only had like a couple of close
friends and I was kind of quiet and I
just didn't really like put myself out
there I only had a couple of close
friends who ended up leaving me going
into high school honestly I met so many
more people in freshman year I met so
many more people who I just loved it
actually made me happy now in high
school I met so many new people into so
many cool different people and I can
honestly say I love to freshmen so I
have some points on my phone that I'm
just gonna look at the first thing I
want to talk about is your studies and
like classes and all that stuff so I
want to say make sure you stay on top of
your studies I know that it's so cliche
and you're just like jello I know I
don't care keep ahead of things because
for me I want to go to a good college I
want to pursue a career in film and all
that accomplishing goals so whether
that's get all A's get all A's and B's
paths I don't even care whatever your
goals are that you just want to meet set
goals at the end of the year you feel
like you've accomplished something study
for tests from middle school to high
school the workload is so much more know
that you're not going to get the perfect
grades anymore that it's okay you can
it's okay but make sure that you're just
keeping on top of things for tests I had
to study so much I'm not the kind of
person you can just not study it all and
get hundreds I wish I was but I'm not at
the study hard core if I wanted a good
grades and it sucks that I'm like that
because I would just be sitting on my
bed making flashcards for like three
hours a night and I felt like such a
nerd and I was at white why do I have to
do this but whenever I got that good
grade on a test or whatever you can
really see your hard work paying off
sometimes I get pop quizzes and I would
literally get 30s and 40s and 50s
because I have to study
I would say at the beginning of the year
everything seems so hard or at least for
me it just seemed like oh my gosh this
is so much work how am I going to deal
with this you get used to it as a year
goes by by January I really got used to
it I really found out my work methods
what works for me and all that stuff so
you do get used to it brave you will be
okay I promise next year I'm taking my
first AP class and I'm really really
scared I don't want to go through that
again second thing I'll be talking about
is making friends because that is the
number one question I get is Michelle
I'm quiet I don't make friends I don't
know how I'm gonna do this in high
school I'm feeling I'm sitting a little
edge I'm gonna get trash can't I sold
out my Instagram I thought was really
funny the first thing I want to say is
join clubs now before you freak out on
me like shut up for the 50 times I would
not be telling you guys that if it
weren't for me I joined my drill team or
dance team freshman year and I met so
many people so many just really cool
people and whenever I started out with
school I already have friends I had
people who I knew and that's so
important that you meet new people if
you join a club and you share the same
interest as people it is so much easier
to meet friends I'm not some super
outgoing person you can just strike up a
conversation with a random person that's
not who I am I've never been like that
so clubs was just such a good way for me
to make friends and meet people and I
would really recommend it now if that's
not your thing you don't want to join
clubs maybe you do a lot of stuff
outside of school I totally understand
that making friends can be a little bit
harder just in your classes maybe take
some fun electives where you do group
work and stuff that's a good way to meet
people Dean Ambrose and more and all
those friends I have I just met them
through school and we are really good
friends I love them so much I don't know
you can't force it you can't be like hi
my name is Michelle be my friend
Oh gotta let happen naturally I'm
sexually having to be a middle schooler
I'm still going to say because I still
think it's kind of important in middle
school I didn't know anybody in one of
my lunches and I was so freaked out I
was like I know what he sit with I don't
know what I'm gonna do and I ended up
sitting with so much of random people I
have never met in my life one of them at
that table was actually Lauren and she
is now one of my best friends and I can
just say him it was awkward the first
day they were probably like who's out
freak with us but eventually we
became friends and still to this day
she's still when my best friend she sent
my much this year as well so if you
don't know anybody in your lunch just go
up to a table I know maybe you'll get
punched maybe you'll get slaps but maybe
you will meet a friendly face that you
will eventually become front now the
third thing I will be talking about is
losing friends because you've probably
heard that your friends change from the
transition of middle school to high
school and I can say it's true I wish I
could tell you that you're best friends
with all your middle school friends but
you're probably not going to be most
likely I lost some of my best friend
just because they changed they got their
priorities straight and I was one of
your priorities and that's just how life
goes people change and you just gotta
let them gotta let people change and
you've got to be open you will meet new
people you will meet better people and I
wouldn't say that unless I did go
through that myself
it sucks it sucks really bad but I can
tell you I'm it makes you a better
person in the end you will probably lose
some friends in the transition but you
just got to let it happen because that's
life life sucks sometimes but you will
get through it I promise
so now I'm going to be talking about the
first day of school and what to expect
and like my first day of school
experience now this is like a total nerd
thing but I am a nerd so I'm just going
to go ahead say this um if you are
scared about getting lost because my
school was huge and I was scared of
getting lost um I started at 8:30 with
the doors open at 8:00 so I went to 8:00
and mapped out my classes I'm such a
nerd why literally I just knocked out
all my classes so I wouldn't get lost
because you do not want to be that kid
in the hallway who's crying and peeing
their pants because they don't know
where to go you can't do that and you do
get lost don't be afraid don't cry ask
somebody maybe there's a friendly face
just be like hey do you know where this
classroom is and I think I did that once
or twice and I was fine and you could
probably make friends through that too
so
everybody's getting lost although
freshmen don't know where they're going
that's life that's how it works and
don't breathe no free free because it'll
be okay I promise I promise so now let
me going on to my Instagram where I got
more specific questions and I'm just
going to answer a few that I find kind
of important definitely follow me on
instagram if you want to be a part of
this Q&amp;amp;A section of my videos Catharine
511 asks is the homework easy and that
definitely depends on your school and
the classes you take for me um it wasn't
homework that was really that difficult
it was test pens on your teacher and the
classes you take sell just a girl asked
was it still easy to do YouTube videos
even though school was in session I
never felt on school days because
sometimes I have practice after school
and it just was not possible I always
filmed on the weekends and then just
like uploaded those videos throughout
the week Sam Cham as did you have
friends the first day of school yeah I
did know a few people through drill team
and I knew pretty much someone at every
single in my classes except a few but I
mean you meet people glittery sparkles
that's how do you not throw up and cry
and have anxiety the day before take a
deep breath it's not bad I don't know
why people make high school such a big
deal because it's really not have a lot
more freedom it's so much better I don't
know why people are freaking out because
it's not really that bad Oh baby asked
will you get trash can no Anna banana
asks are the juniors in seniors as bad
as everyone says they are and I would
say no yeah the first week they're gonna
be like a little fish nerd and intern
air it's stupid but for the first week
you probably will get made fun of a
little bit your refreshment but that's
just how it works
think they're the top dogs and let them
think that because you'll probably need
senior student you're probably thinking
the same thing eventually LG so2 asks
how do you deal with Mean Girls if you
do not want to deal with Mean Girls stay
away from quote Mean Girls because
that's the best philosophy I have
surround yourself with people that make
you happy not people that are going to
be mean to you and if you ever have any
counter with these people then walk away
ignore them are some people in high
school that still act like they're in
middle school that would be these quote
Mean Girls and you just have got to
ignore them let them have their fun they
think they're awesome that's cool just
ignore it silly egginess are even saying
that wrong if you could tell every
freshman something to make them not look
like idiots in high school what would it
be probably don't act overconfident
because there's some people going there
like often
since I was 2 and I'm just awesome don't
act like you're some stud muffin and
you're awesome
I love you acacia acid you say friend to
the people you were friends with in
middle school see you're friends with a
few of them but yeah I did lose friends
from middle school</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
