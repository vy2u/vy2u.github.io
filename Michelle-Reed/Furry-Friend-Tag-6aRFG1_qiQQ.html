friend tag if you don't know what this
is just like a video with one of your
pets this is my dog and I just have like
questions on my phone and if she's
acting crazy it's because I have a bacon
guy in here a good tree and she's kind
of freaking out okay what is your pet's
name this is Daisy
sit sit what kind of pet is it in what
breed she has a dog obviously and she is
a full bred Golden Retriever so yeah how
long have you had your pet friend she is
18 how dear since I was I was 6 how did
you get your pet I got her from a family
that had like 5 golden retrievers and
she was one of them and I think she was
like the runt of them because she's
actually pretty small she's only like 60
pounds and she's really skinny but she
needs a lot so I don't know it's just so
small how old is your pet
she's like 8 or 9 I think that's kind of
bad that we don't know her birthday
obviously she's kind of older cuz she
has like the white on her face yeah
what are some quirky things about your
pets personality um she gets jealous
because we have a bunny and if we're
like holding her petting her she'll like
go crazy and she gets jealous a lot what
does your relationship with your pet
mean deep love her I've always loved her
since I was like really really little
it's like so sweet she's never ever mean
hey she's literally like never mean
she's so nice and she's like such well
trained she's like the sweetest dog ever
she's never bad like ever she's like the
perfect dog what are some of your
favorite pastimes with your pet I loved
when she was
tiny puppy she was so cute us maybe like
she's still adorable now like you can't
resist his face it's like so playful and
yeah I just loved her I still love her
though you have another dog Mandy but
she died but she would like jump all
over she used to be really crazy but I
think it's because she's older now she's
kind of what our dick names that you
call your pet I call her a Daisy Doo
bird
I call her pups like all the time unlike
Evelyn can witness Stacy I always like
walk in from school I'd be like hey he's
