you guys my complete summer hair makeup
and outfit look so sit back and enjoy so
first we're starting off with the makeup
look so I'm taking my bare skin and
pulling back my hair with my adorable
headband that i'm using my boots mousse
foundation which is a little bit too tan
for my face but my body is actually a
lot saner than my face right now so i'm
applying this to kind of even out my
skin tone then i'm using my revlon
photoready concealer to cover any dark
circles or blemishes and now I usually
wouldn't wear this much makeup in the
summer but if I'm going out I will wear
this much then i'm taking my Rimmel stay
matte powder of course and then setting
everything I mean would this even be one
of my videos if I didn't use this then
I'm taking my elf blush in candid coral
and applying this because I think it's
more of a summer in shade and of course
you got to fill in your brows so i'm
using my benefit brow kit and just kind
of defining them a little bit but not
filling them in too much then taking my
maybelline color tattoo and barely
branded i'm using this as a kind of
champagne primer and then i'm using my
stila in the light palette and using the
kind of light gold color called bubbly
all over my lid
and then i'm using my naked palette and
using half baked on the kind of outer
half of my lid for a more defined goal
then for the crease i'm using my
favorite color which is naked just to
kind of define overall the whole look
then lastly i'm taking these two brown
shades and putting them in the outer
corner to give that final touch of
definition and then you have to blind so
I'm just blending this all out with my
favorite blending brush and now I can't
do this on camera but i'm using my stila
brown eyeliner and we're just going to
magically pretend I did and then for
mascara I'm using my covergirl clump
crusher all over my lashes then to
moisturize i'm using my gos lip balm
before i apply any lip products and for
a nice kind of shimmery coral color I'm
using this clinic lipstick and sugar too
great for that is it for the makeup look
so now on to the hair first I am just
going to brush it all out and pin back
my veins and then doing my favorite
curls with my Hot Tools 1 inch wand and
I'm just wrapping it around holding it
for 10 seconds then letting it go to get
these very soft natural wave corolle
thingies and then of course you have to
hairspray it so I'm just using my
favorite hairspray and kind of running
my fingers through it to give it that
wavy look and I did it to the other side
as well then i'm taking my bangs or just
the front part of your hair and braiding
it just like a normal braid
and then you're going to use your
elastic which ideally would be clear but
of course I ran out which is just
fabulous so I'm just securing that and
then I'm kind of pulling it apart to
give it that more boho look and then I'm
just going to tease the crown of my hair
because we all need a little bit of
volume and I'm just pulling the braid
back and pinning it and then I just did
this to the other side as well and
hairspray to everything so that is a
super cute braided bohemian summer
hairstyle that I absolutely love and now
we are on to the outfits so this is kind
of what I do every time in the summer it
takes me a lot less time to pick out my
outfit is really who cares to be honest
for my dress I am wearing this free
people dress which is absolutely
beautiful it's so summery and loose and
comfortable and I absolutely love it
especially the sleeves like come on and
then my bag is this super cute fringe
kind of bohemian I know I've sit
bohemian like five times but bohemian
bag and I think it's very chill and just
goes with a dress
and then my sandals are these super-cute
strappy urban outfitters black ones that
I absolutely love and that is it for the
summer look so I really really hope you
guys enjoyed this and try out this very
simple very classic summer look XOXO
