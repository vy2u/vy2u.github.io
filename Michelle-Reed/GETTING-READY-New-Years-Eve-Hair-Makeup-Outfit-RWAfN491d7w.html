and my eyebrows already filled in for
blush I used my Too Faced cream blush
and T rose just as a nice kind of Bobbi
pink color I packed on this Maybelline
Color tattoo and barely branded so these
shimmery eyeshadows would really stand
out using my 88 color palette from
Coastal Scents I use the silver shade
all over my lid then taking this lorac
palette I use the colour slates in the
crease and then make sure to blend it
out very well to really smoke up the
eyeshadow I applied a black color to the
very outer corner and then blend it out
like there was no tomorrow then I went
back in with that slate shade and
applied it to my lower lash line and
then I took that silver shade and
applied it to kind of the inner corner
then I applied some subtle eyeliner with
my ELF cream eyeliner to define the eyes
I just added in my favorite rocket
mascara to finish off the eye look for
lips I apply my MAC lipstick in rebel
which is pretty intense so you can do
something a little more natural but I
personally love this color
since the eye look is SuperDuper intense
I decided to do pretty natural curls I
just brushed out my hair and then teased
the top and then I used my hot tools
clipless curling iron which is about in
1 inch barrel and I just wrapped pretty
large sections around the barrel and
held it for maybe 3 to 5 seconds and
then let go to get these very loose
curls then I just ran some hairspray
throughout my hair and made sure to comb
out the curls to make them more soft
with a comb and that is it for this hair
look
now my outfit is not all that glitzy but
I love it because I could wear it for
other occasions as well so my shirt is
from Target and it's just a plain black
shirt and then my tights are from j.crew
this houndstooth skirt is from choies
and it's super cool in it I absolutely
love it and then my necklace is from
world market for shoes I wear these all
the time but they are my favorite
booties from DSW and that is all for my
outfit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
