five easy ways to get fit for this
summertime this is a super fun collab
video with in the Elizabeth and Miss
Molly and fourteen Kenzie is going to be
doing five easy ways to lose weight /
kadhai fitness routine molly is going to
be showing you guys some inexpensive
healthy recipes so you should definitely
check out their videos i'll have them
linked down below
they're both great youtubers that we all
make pretty similar videos so if you
like my videos you're probably gonna
like their videos and if you happen to
be from either Kenzie or Molly's channel
or just on youtube you should definitely
subscribe the buttons right here I blow
it off Sundays and Thursdays I just
wanted to say that I'm not a health
expert but I am very much into fitness
and working out and just eating right
and so these are the tips that work for
me I'm not saying that you're
necessarily going to get a perfect
bikini body for summer because I feel
like being fit is something that you
should strive for all year round
you're more likely to do something
consistently if you actually enjoy doing
it so if you really enjoy doing yoga do
yoga if you really enjoy biking bike
Urmi I actually really really enjoy
running it's something that whenever I
first started working out I hated like I
could not make it through a while
without dying and now if I run three or
four miles
I feel really rejuvenated and it just
makes me feel really really great
obviously if you try something new
you're gonna be pretty tired from it
after you workout for the first time and
that doesn't mean oh hey I don't like
this it just means oh your body's not
used to it but I'm something that you
enjoy doing because it definitely makes
working out a lot easier and less of a
choice
when you have someone there whose tummy
like okay Michelle you know we're gonna
workout Monday Tuesday Wednesday
Thursday from 5 to 6 p.m. every night
you're more likely to keep consistent
with it also working out with friends is
just a lot more fun because you're gonna
enjoy it work is you can talk and hang
out and just kind of have someone there
to push you and push you through your
workout so it's one of those days where
you're just feeling super duper lazy and
you're laying in bed and you're like you
know what I'm not gonna work out but you
have a friend who will tell you hey
Michelle you know we need to go that's
definitely gonna help you get on the bed
and keep you on a track for working out
because the key to being healthy and to
having you know more of a fit body is to
do something consistently you know you
can workout for like two hours one day
but not for the next two weeks and
nothing's gonna happen so just make sure
you're consistent and get your friends
healthy
I find that much more likely to eat more
fruits and vegetables that they're more
fresh and they're locally grown and I
actually really enjoyed having them and
so also just going to a farmers market
is fun like getting outside and going
through Congress everything it can be
just a fun thing to do during the summer
but it's more likely to keep you eating
healthy if you actually have really good
quality fruits because trust me good
quality fruits honestly tastes like
candy and they don't even seem like
you're eating something healthy so
definitely try that out look around
locally pretty screwed is really really
great and you should check it out so
this next tip is one of my favorite
breakfast smoothies that I enjoy baking
I know spoon these don't really fill me
up but this one specifically is so good
I basically like to take about one and a
half bananas preferably frozen but the
ones I had in this video weren't frozen
and so I just added in some eyes make
sure they're really ripe and super
spotty again mine weren't super spotty
but for the video and then a scoop of
peanut butter you can do scoop and a
half depending on what you like I also
like to add in some blueberries because
I think blueberries taste really good in
it and then some almond milk or coconut
milk whatever milk you prefer to use and
then I'll add some cinnamon on top and
then I'll also add in some oats you can
cook your oats or not cook them I didn't
cook myself that's necessarily bad but
it tastes the same to me and I like the
texture that it makes with the smoothie
so then I just blend it all up
honestly keeps me sustained for such a
long time and I definitely recommend
making it you're gonna be able to lose
weight or be healthier if you don't have
breakfast so make sure you keep that in
to get that summer bod
and this next tip is one of my favorite
workouts that I like to do to help tone
my stomach and my abs because I know for
summertime that's definitely more of a
concern for people so first I'd like to
start off with normal situps I basically
put my legs at 90 degrees and I will do
30 making sure that I keep my shoulder
blades off the ground and then I will do
30 seconds of leg down so basically you
just put your hands to your side and
make sure your legs go down and back up
this really works your lower abs and
then I put my legs into a toe touch
position and I basically just go up for
30 seconds as well and then I will do 30
seconds of bicycle sit up for some
reason these ones really really work me
so just do these for 30 seconds and they
really work your obliques that I like to
do ankle taps for 30 seconds so
basically you just lean up and you try
to touch your ankles and it really works
your obliques and then I like to do
Russian twists in the video I didn't do
this with a medicine ball but I'll
usually do it with a ten-pound one I'll
just go back and forth for 30 seconds as
well then I'll just do the standard side
sit-ups for 30 seconds on each side so
just making sure again to get my
shoulder blades off the ground and then
I would do pull threes which basically
just I go up and then I try to pull my
hands through my legs and then I will
pulse for 30 seconds after doing 30
seconds on the pull three and then I
will hold a plank for one minute a side
plank for 30 seconds and then the other
side plank for 30 seconds and then I
Warpaint's everything again so have a
picture inserted right here so if you
just want to look at something and be
able to tell what to do it'll be right
here so you can screenshot it but it's
definitely one of my favorite ab
workouts to do and definitely tones my
eyes which is something that I know a
lot of people want right now so those
are the five tips that I have for you

fit for summer definitely leave them
