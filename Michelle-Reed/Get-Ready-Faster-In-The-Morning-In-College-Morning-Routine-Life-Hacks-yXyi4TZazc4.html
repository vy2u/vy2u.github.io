with you guys 10 ways to get ready
faster in the morning for college I know
a lot of you guys are probably going to
college and I know there's a big big
thing where people skip class because if
we spend too long and they can't get up
and so today I'll be sharing with you
guys my top tips for getting ready fast
I also want to thank Gillette Venus for
working with me on this video I
absolutely love their razors and they're
literally building once I ears also make
sure to leave your number and kit down
below for getting ready faster so we can
all help each other out in this video
because I know we can all use some help
in this department let's go ahead and
get right into the video my first tip
would be to take your showers at
nighttime whenever I take my showers at
night you save a ton of time in the
morning because you don't actually do in
the morning I also really like shaving
my legs at night there's something about
getting into a bed with clean sheets and
clean shave and legs it just feels so so
good by Tuesday the razors are both from
Gillette Venus I absolutely love it it's
the first one that I have is the
Gillette Venus comfort glide and I also
have the Gillette Venus swirl both these
razors make me feel so confident because
they just really really shave my legs
well and they keep them smooth
especially in the summertime which is
really important to me they have a ton
of different razors so depending on
which one kind of fits your needs
Gillette Venus have them all for you of
these two just happened to be my
favorite one so let me this is also the
number one women's raised their brand
and they also have a really cute hashtag
called smooth score that you can use to
show why you like them first one that I
use is the Gillette Venus comfort Glide
I really like this one because I don't
want to get in awkward positions to
shave it just really gets around all of
the kind of hard to get areas and it's
really comfortable to use also on this
razor it has the skin nourishing body
butter gels which are really nice
because whenever you're shaving they
kind of release onto your legs and they
leave them feeling SuperDuper smooth and
so on and we don't have to use any
shaving cream with this since they do
have the body butters on it which is
really really great my favorite one
though is the Gillette Venus swirl razor
I like this one because it has be
flexible on it it's the only razor that
has this and basically it just helps get
especially around your knees which I
really like so if I'm not always
companies this or one also has advanced
blades on it so it gets around every
single little
so you don't have you know like awkward
patches that you missed while shaving
plus both of these razors especially for
the summertime whenever you're wearing a
cute bikini and so you don't have to
worry about having unwanted hair and you
want to check out Gillette Venus just
make sure to check out your local CVS
you can pick them up there but yeah my
first dippin definitely be take your
showers at night number two would be to
pack your schoolbag the night before
there is so many mornings that I would
just be rushing to like shovel must
dozen but school bag and I was totally
being late to class make sure you just
pack everything the night before your
book you know your wallet all that good
stuff so you can just grab it in the
morning number three would be to make
smoothie bags the night before I love
starting my morning off with a knife
smoothie so I would just pack like my
banana berry spinach ice whatever it may
be then I just dump it in the blender
add some almond milk and you're good to
go
breakfast is really important to me and
so if I don't make these I'm just always
thrown off so I usually make like 5 out
of time so I'm set for the week
number four is kind of weird is
something that I just started doing the
UM be to brush your teeth in the shower
even if it just say it's like a couple
minutes guys it really does save time
and it's really nice to do and so I
recommend just sticking your toothbrush
in the shower brush it in the shower and
you're going to go number 5 it would be
to have pictures of your outfits already
on your phone so you can just pick them
out the morning up I know they always
say to like pack your outfit the night
before but I never do this because I
always wake up and want to change it so
what I like to do is have pictures
already at my outfit of the days on my
phone so I can just scroll through them
pick one and you don't actually have to
go through the struggle of picking out
an outfit it's just already on your
phone number six would be to use your
bronzer as eyeshadow so while you're
contouring your face just go ahead and
use it as I showed up you want to do a
crease color or like lid color to put it
all over and it looks really good and
it's really easy if you like to wear eye
shadow number seven would be to put a
Julis on your mirror even if you have to
do the morning I just write down a few
things that you want to get done and
having it on your mirror is nice because
every time you go to check your outfit
do your makeup or whatever it you can
just kind of get a list of like what you
have to do now - it really does save
time
number eight would be to use dry shampoo
instead of washing your hair I have used
dry shampoos so much because I just find
that I like my hair by there whenever
it's a little dirty like today I just
put some dry shampoo and fold it back
and I just felt really set to go and it
feel like I had actually like do
anything to my hair dry shampoo saves a
ton of time in the morning because you
don't have to actually wash your hair
and also just gives it volume and
texture 9 would be to have a playlist
already ready on your phone there are so
many times when I would like want to jam
out in the morning I would spend like 10
minutes trying to take a playlist so
that I can forward just kind of like and
get a list of like oh yeah I know I'm
going to listen to the song and so you
just wake up press play and start your
day and every time would be to put your
lotion in your body spray in your
backpack so while you're walking to
class you can put it on then there are
so many mornings and I would just like
run out the door be like I totally
forgot to put on deodorant lotion or
body spray whatever it may be so if you
have those kind of like extra little
things just put them in your backpack so
you just put them on on the way to class
so those are all the things that I would
have to say help you get ready faster in
the morning again let me know what you
like to use down below you want to go
watch my last video it'll be linked
right here I've also been vlogging on my
second channel which you can check out
just of all my other social medias I
know it's like 10 different plugs but if
you want to know more my life just go on
all the different platforms I love you
guys and I'll see you guys in the next
one bye friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
