say I'm here to do another get ready
video with me and this one's going to be
more of like a bohemian summer kind of
style so I'm gonna be showing you guys
this hairstyle in another hairstyle that
I actually like better than this one but
they're both kind of sides what's
bohemian Styles this makeup look and
then the outfit that I'm currently
wearing before I get into the video I
want to really quickly just talk about
an app called snuff that I have
discovered that helped me kind of pick
out my outfit today and find my favorite
products that I've been using lately
basically this app is kind of similar to
Instagram where you just post photos but
it's a lot more organized so you create
shelves where you keep different
sections of your life is kind of the
best way I can describe it so I have one
with like my summer dresses summer tops
places that I've been lately just to
kind of document what I've been doing my
go-to makeup products and also outfits
of the day which is my favorite section
of it especially if you have a lot of
clothes in your closet you can go and
take a picture of every article of
clothing you have and you can scroll
through them and kind of see like what
you have because I know sometimes I
forget that some of the pieces that I
have or in there I'll just like
completely forget to wear them yeah it's
such a cool app and like I said it
helped me create my outfit that I'm
wearing today so if you want to follow
me I'll have my username right here I'm
pretty sure it's just this is smiling
shell I'll also have a link where you
can download it down below and I
definitely suggest trying it out because
it's just another cool social media app
that I've been dating lately if you
happen to stumble across this video and
you're not subscribed you should
definitely do that right now I upload
every Sunday and Thursday and I've been
kind of on a roll with my summer videos
so you should definitely enjoy my little
family and yeah with all that said let's
just go ahead and get into the video
so to start off the makeup I'm using my
laura geller hydrating face primer just
so my makeup stays on all day and then
I'm using my L'Oreal infallible
foundation with a Beauty Blender sponge
to give the foundation a more natural
look I am then going in with my
Anastasia brow pencil and filling in my
brows a little bit to define them then
I'm priming my eyelids with my lorac eye
primer to ensure that my eyeshadow stays
on and I'm also using my Clinique chubby
stick in Bountiful beige as a shimmery
base we're using LT bronze from my lorac
Pro palette in the inner half of my
eyelids and then I'm going in with the
shade called at dusk by Clinique
I'm going in with this in my outer half
of my eyelid and then in the crease were
just putting taupe all over to give it
kind of a softer look in the very outer
corner I am using olive in my martini
which is a nice kind of olive shade by
Clinique and then as a highlight I am
using cream for my war Pro palette I am
NOT just smudging that olive shade on my
lower lash line and doing a thin line of
eyeliner with this L'Oreal carbon black
eyeliner and finishing off with some
mascara this is the l'oreal voluminous
mango one then i'm going in with my
concealer i'm using again my favorite
age or wine concealer it rocks this is
the brightener and it really brightens
up my face and i'm setting all of the
face makeup with a powder this is the
revlon colorstay one as a contour shade
I am using my BH Cosmetics palette and
taking this bronzing shade and then I'm
using a soft pink shade of blush from
Mac and finishing off with my lipstick
which is airy-fairy from Renly
so for these hair looks I went to have
some nice natural wave so I'm just
wrapping my hair around a one-inch
barrel very loosely to my hair to give
it some wave and body and then I'm going
in with some hairspray and kind of
crunching it to give it more of a
natural texturizer look for the first
look I'm just tossing my hair over my
shoulder and I'm taking kind of a
half-up half-down style from each ends
of my ear and I'm tying this up and then
basically you just split it in half and
then you push the hair out and over it I
don't know what this is called it might
be a pull-through but I'm just grabbing
some more hair and I'm keep doing this
down the piece of hair until I've done
it three times it's really really easy
then we are doing a five strand braid
after that so basically you just section
your hair and five strands and you take
one piece from the other side and put it
over and then under another piece and
then you go on the other side and do the
same thing it's very difficult honestly
and it took me a long time to learn but
it looks really cool so have an in-depth
tour tutorial down below that I actually
learned from if you want to check it out
but then I'm just securing the hair and
loosening up and that was the first
hairstyle for the next hairstyle all you
do is take a top section of your hair
and split it into three pieces and do
one start of the braid just like a
normal braid and then on your second go
take a hair from the right side and then
take a hair from the left side and braid
it in I believe this is a Dutch braid
but I think it looks really cool and I
just did this to the ends of my hair
when I couldn't braid anymore but once
you get past your ear you can just do a
normal braid on have to do the Dutch and
then you just secure it and loosen it up
a bunch it looks a lot better if you
loosen it up a lot then I just took
about a three inch section on the other
side of hair and I did a fishtail braid
until a few it just passed my ear and
then I loosened it up secured it and
then I push it over to the other side
and then like the first hairstyle I just
pushed it through the braid and then I
wrapped the piece of hair around the
band and I secured it and curled some
pieces and that's it for this hairstyle
so for my outfit I am wearing this top
from Tobi that's super bohemian I love
it so much it's flowy and so summery and
then my bralette is from Urban
Outfitters these are so contour I
definitely recommend picking some up and
then my leaf shorts are from choice as
well as my supercool sunglasses and then
my bag is from Madewell
and yeah that's pretty much it for my
outfit
