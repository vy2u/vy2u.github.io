along with me as I get ready for the
fourth of July I know that the fourth of
July has already passed but this look is
still wearable for any days so hope you
guys enjoy with Bella as the leaves turn
brown so first we're just gonna start
off with this very summery festive
makeup look so I'm ready do my
foundation routine which I'll link down
below and I just failed I used my ELF
candid coral blush like always to give
my skin a glow and then I used my
maybelline color tattoo and barely
branded to prime my eyes for the
eyeshadow i will be using then i took
this clinic eyeshadow which doesn't
really have a name but it's kind of just
a soft champagne color and i set to the
cream shadow with this eyeshadow and
then i use my urban decay naked eye
shadow which is my all-time favorite
crease color and i just put that in the
crease like usual and this brush is
super super rough on my eyes so that
explains his face then I took Urban
Decay's buck and applied this in the
outer corner just kind of as a soft
brown shade and then i use my clinic
chocolate brown eyeshadow in the very
very outer corner to define the
eyeshadow and then like always we've got
to blend that eyeshadow out yeah
and then i'm using my naked 3 palette
and taking any color called dust and i'm
applying this to my eyelids because it
kind of looks shimmery like fireworks if
you know what I'm saying then I use
Maybelline Color tattoo and I don't know
the color it's just like a blue color
and applied this to my lower lash line
and then I said it with a couple blue
eye shadows from my Coastal Scents
palette and then i use my elf gel
eyeliner which you guys know i can't do
on camera so whoa let's pretend i did it
on camera and then I just curled my
eyelashes and apply my rocket mascara
because it's my favorite stem for the
lips i'm using my maybelline superstay
lip stain which i love because it stays
on all night but the only thing is it
does dry out so after the lip color
dries make sure you put on a little bit
of chapstick so your lips aren't all
crackly and that's is it for this super
pretty makeup look now on to the hair
i'm doing this Bohemia braid which you
guys have requested me to do it story on
for a while so first i'm using my Hot
Tools one-inch curling wand and I'm
curling my hair so if you have wavy hair
or curly hair just skip this step you're
fine but if you have super straight hair
like me maybe try to curl it because I
think it adds to the look
and then once i'm done i am here
spraying it all I'm kind of running my
fingers through it and then teasing the
top with my teasing comb because you got
to have some volume now what you do is
pull the hair back and leave about a
fourth of it down and just braid the
section you're holding into a very loose
kind of braids then I'm just securing it
and pulling some hair up from the fronts
kind of moving it around making it look
a little more messy and yeah that's this
very very simple yet adorable braid so
for my outfit um it's not really
something that you have to wear on
fourth of July you can wear it whenever
but my shorts are just these maroon
colored high-waisted shorts from Urban
Outfitters they're very very comfy and I
feel like they make me look a little
Tanner's so yeah it's always a plus am I
sure it's just a slight cropped shirt
from pacsun and my shoes I've been
wearing these since I bought them
they're just sandals from target I
actually went to a little festival near
my town where they were setting off
fireworks and I used my new Polaroid
camera and I had so much fun I went with
my boyfriend at my family and it was a
whole lot of fun
so make sure to give this video a thumbs
up if you enjoyed it and I'll see you
guys my next video adios amigos XOXO
