about getting ready for homecoming so
I'm going to be showing you guys a
hairstyle the makeup look I would do and
also what outfit I would wear if this
look is more casual or more dressy than
you would usually wear to your
homecoming back completely okay you can
modify it to fit whatever attire or
whatever like makeup look is suitable
for your school nobody really goes to
the homecoming dance unfortunately at my
school so I don't really have experience
with knowing like what's too dressy and
what's not and I also didn't want to
spend like $200 on the dress I wasn't
going to wear also this may be too early
for your school I don't really know when
everyone's homecomings are but I know
around me a lot of people's are coming
up soon so I'm just doing it in advance
for those people also subscribe if you
happen to be new to my channel I upload
every Sunday and Thursday and I'd love
to have you here a part of my family Oh
with all that being said we're just
gonna go ahead and get into the video so
first we're starting off with the makeup
look which is a smokey eye I am using
brushes from royal and langnickel and
actually have a coupon code for 20% off
right here and I'll have them linked
down below I'm using the 20 pieces kit
and I absolutely love them so I'm
starting off with the Smashbox photo
finish primer because you'll most likely
be taking pictures at homecoming and you
want your makeup to last all night then
I'm using the covergirl Ready Set
gorgeous foundation it's my absolute
favorite and I'm just using a Beauty
Blender to get a more natural finish and
to prime the eyes I'm using my benefit
boying concealer and I'm just gonna set
it with some translucent powder because
I find that this holds the smoky eye is
the best rather than using an actual
primer I am also using the crease brush
to do the powder so I'm going to be
using my Urban Decay Naked smokey
palette I really like this palette the
colors are beautiful and I'm taking
whisky and I'm using this as a
transition color so I'm just working
this into the crease and then I'm going
over it with Radar to give it more of a
sparkly finish for whisky I use the
crease brush and then for radar I just
use the smudger
so then I'm going in with the shade
armor which is a really pretty glittery
color and I'm using the middle size flat
shader brush and I'm just plying this to
my eyelids I really like it I think it's
a very pretty color then with this
smudger brush I am using the black
market and dagger shades and I'm
applying these both into the outer
corner and just mixing them and then to
highlight the inner corners I am using
the shade hai which is a really pretty
shimmery color
next I'm highlighting under my eyes with
the instant age rewind brightener and
I'm kind of swooping this up in a kind
of V motion because this is going to
kind of clean up all the excess on the
side from the eyeshadow and also cover
up any glitter that may have fallen off
and then I'm just setting this with the
translucent powder which is the Rimmel
stay matte so then I'm using the shade
password I'm doing this on my lower lash
line about two 3/4 from the outer edge
and then I'm taking the shade dagger and
I'm going from the middle to the outer
lower lash line and then black market
which is going to be on the very outer
lash line and I'm using a lip brush to
do this which may seem weird but it's
the perfect size then I'm lining my eyes
with the l'oreal liner intense eye liner
and I'm doing a little bit of mascara
I'm actually doing a lot of mascara we
are really coating this on because big
lashes aren't fun to put on then I'm
just setting all my makeup with the
powder brush with that same powder that
we used earlier and then I'm going in
with my Anastasia brow pencil and
filling in my brows to the desired
amount that I'm feeling and then I'm
applying my hoola bronzer I love this
bronzer and I also really love this
angled brush it's so amazing it
perfectly sculpts your face it's awesome
and then I'm using my NARS blush in the
shade Dolce Vita which is such such a
pretty color I love it
kind of a Mavi pink color and then
lastly we're just finishing off the lips
with the Rimmel lipstick in a 8 which is
coming off a lot darker on camera it's
not that's Ark in person it's a nice
neutral but that's it for the makeup you
should definitely check out the brushes
down below as well super hair I am doing
my favorite fishtail up to do which I've
showed in a video before but you guys
always ask me how I do this so I'm
starting off with slightly wavy hair to
give the braids some texture I also have
a middle part and I'm doing some teasing
at the top of my head so the updo has a
little bit of volume and then I'm just
fishtailing both sides of my hair if you
don't know how to do this you basically
just take small chunks and move them
over to the other side I'll link a video
down below of someone who actually does
an in-depth tutorial then I just kind of
like to loosen up the braids because it
gives the updo a more texturized to look
then I pull out some pieces and kind of
you know mess up the hair so it's not
too uniform it's more messy and then I
just move the pieces across my hair and
I bobby pin them and I will pin down the
sides in the front because they look
kind of weird
then I will hairspray and that's it it's
super easy and I wear it all the time is
so pretty I love it
so my dress is from choies I know it may
not be everyone's cup of tea but it is
so fluttery and pretty and it makes me
feel like I'm a princess so I love it
and then my necklace is from Francesca's
and my bangle is from H&amp;amp;M my gold heels
are from DSW and that is it for the look
so I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video it definitely tweet me pictures or
tag me on instagram if you happen to try
outs the makeup look or the hair look in
this video I would love to see it you
should also watch my last video with
this guy because he did my everyday
makeup routine himself it was pretty
good so go check that one out and I'll
see you guys my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
