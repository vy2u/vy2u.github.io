this video because I'm going to be a
problem get ready with me video so I'm
showing you guys this makeup look my
hair and my dress now obviously I'm in
college so not actually going to prom
but back at high school prom formal and
banquets were totally my thing if you
guys have stuck around for a while you
know I have been posting these videos
for such a long time and I was thinking
I was like it would be so weird if I
just didn't post one of these this year
let me know down below when you're
promised if you're going to prom and
what you're planning on wearing whether
that be like your dress your makeup your
hair look I'd love to know also make
sure to tweet me pictures and tag me in
your Instagram pictures because I would
love to see how good you guys look up
Iran this year so just go ahead and get
right into it I would just like to note
that I am wearing a dress right now but
it is just not showing I promise I'm not
naked
so for makeup I'm starting off with my
covergirl clean BB cream and I'm just
applying this all over my face
and then I'm using my bomb time ball and
foundation as concealer over all of the
spots in my face so I feel like need a
little bit more coverage then I'm just
concealing my eyelids and setting this
with some translucent powder and then I
am just going in with my Rimmel brow
powder and I am running this through my
brows and then going back over with a
spoolie this is my benefit brow product
and then I am just going in with my new
tooth palette from the balm and going in
with a tan color in my crease and then
I'm just defining it a little bit more
with this darker brown shadow then using
my Maybelline creme shadow in the shade
bold gold I'm applying this all over my
lids and then I'm going in with this
Maybelline eye shadow which is a really
pretty gold color all products will be
linked down below if you want to check
them out I'm just applying that over top
and then just applying my instant age
rewind concealer underneath my eyelids
and then I'm just blending the Sun and
setting everything with my covergirl
translucent powder very very lightly
because I want to keep this look as dewy
as possible and as you can tell my
forehead or my face in general is a lot
a lot paler than my body so I'm going in
with my Too Faced chocolate Soleil
bronzer and I'm just applying this on my
cheekbones my forehead and my
chin area also going in with this peachy
colored blush on my cheekbones and then
I'm just applying my clinic chubby
highlights on the tops of my cheekbones
and my chin and my nose area and I'm
just going back over that with Mac's
soft and gentle to really make sure
everything looks shimmery and pretty and
then I'm going in and I'm applying some
false eyelashes these are just demi
whispies from Rimmel not remote from
ardell and then I'm just going in with
my Clinique eyeliner I'm applying this
to my eyelids just to make sure
everything looks good with the fake
eyelashes then I was going with my
clinics flutter to full mascara and I'm
applying this over top and then I'm
finishing off with my super red lipstick
from Milani that exact name will be
linked down below and that is it for the
makeup look for hair I'm keeping things
really simple and sleek I'm just
brushing through my hair and putting a
little bit of hairspray through it and
I'm just going to run this through to
kind of comb away any flyaways and then
I'm just going over and straightening my
hair to where it's like stick straight
until I get a really really sleek look
because I've really been tender like
sleek straight here as opposed to you
know crazy curls or anything and I think
it's such a pretty and classy prom look
I love it love it love it so back in
high school I would never ever wear red
dresses they always scared me but I
actually found this one at t.j.maxx and
I thought it was so cute it's the brand
crystal doll really really simple it was
like 35 dollars and I think it's just so
pretty and something that I could
actually wear again and then I just
paired it with some new pumps which are
from Clarke so they're so so comfortable
but that is it for my prom looks super
classy and super elegant and I really
hope you guys enjoyed watching this
video I had so much fun filming it I
absolutely love these videos and I don't
even remember the last time I wore red
lipstick I feel like I'm like in drill
team again like at a recital I think
it's so much fun make sure to go watch
my last video which will also be linked
right here and let me know what else you
would like to see for
down below leave me a comment I love you
guys and I'll see you all my next one my
