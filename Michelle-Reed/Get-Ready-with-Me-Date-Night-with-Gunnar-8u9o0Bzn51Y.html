going to be taking you guys along with
me as I get ready for a date that I'm
going on tonight except this is more of
just of what I've been doing with my
makeup and a cool hairstyle that I like
to do occasionally video but that was
too long for titles so this is just
gonna be kind of a getting ready style
video I want to apologize for the kind
of Mia videos I've had lately I have
been so busy with school I just had
finals all week and a lot of tests
before that and I actually just got back
from taking SAT this morning my videos
have just been kind of blah lately and
so hopefully I will jazz it up now that
I have more time to focus on YouTube
which is a great thing make sure to
subscribe if you enjoy this video or any
of my videos it wants to see more of my
face and also give this video like if
you like getting ready with me because I
hope that's a fun thing to do so without
further adieu we're just gonna go ahead
and get started so like always we are
going to start off with the makeup
portion i'm using my covergirl whipped
cream foundation i love this stuff it
makes my skin so glowy it is beautiful
in a stroke store and then I used my
Maybelline anti age or wide concealer
for my dark circles
then I used my cracked setting powder
which I have still yet to buy a new one
and I spilt it on my pants so go me to
add to the glow to my face I am using my
pure Marvel blush it's just a nice kind
of rosy pink color super pretty and then
I use my elf eyebrow kit to fill in
those brows because the brow game must
be on point my friends to cry my eyes
I'm using my lorac eye primer to prepare
for the eye shadow and then I just took
my NYX jumbo eye shadow pencil in the
color yogurt and I use this as a base
it's kind of a Goldy peach champagne
color I'm using my lorac Pro palette and
taking the color nude I'm applying this
to my lid and then I use taupe and
totally missed like pointing to the
eyeshadow so I'm sorry but I applied
this to the crease for the outer corner
I just applied some of sable to define
the eyes and then highlighted my brows
underneath my brows and my inner corner
with the color cream I've been loving my
they're real push-up liner so I just
applied this and did kind of a slight
wing and then finished off with some
mascara
to finish the look I applied my Rimmel
lip stick and airy-fairy is a beautiful
kind of nude color and then as it for
the makeup super natural and pretty
so just finished my makeup and now we're
on to do the hair look for hair I don't
know about you guys but I cannot do my
hair without watching Netflix so I
definitely turned on some Dance Moms
I used my hot tools one inch kind of
tapered curling iron like always and did
my typical curls I do these in a lot of
my videos super easy and simple just
wrap it around the barrel for a few
seconds but I decided to kind of do a
front French braid type thing so I took
a piece from the side I don't really
know if this is a French braid but it
looks kind of cool and then once I got
to my ear I just braided normally and
then I secured this with a clear elastic
and loosened it and I just think it's
kind of cute and bohemian
so I didn't have a lot of time to fill
my outfits because I want to see a movie
with gunner but my dress is from brandy
melville it's black and then my jean
jacket is from forever21
my tights are from j.crew and my little
socks are from Urban Outfitters and then
these writing boots are from Dillard's I
forgot the name of the brand but I'll
have them down below and then my
necklace is from Madewell and that was
it for my outfit
Oh
