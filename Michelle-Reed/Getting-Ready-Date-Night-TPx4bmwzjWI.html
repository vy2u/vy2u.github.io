that I could wear my pajamas on a date
that's kind of not possible so this is
definitely the first step to getting
ready for day two makeup I'm using my
covergirl stay fabulous foundation I
love it because it gives my skin the
coverage it needs but it's not too cakey
so I think it's great for a date because
you still want to look like yourself and
not being caked on with makeup then I'm
taking my Garnier roller ball which has
concealer in it I absolutely love this
because it wakes me up and gets rid of
my dark circles and then I'm just
setting all this with my stay matte
powder from Rimmel I absolutely love it
and I've used it for ever it seems like
now I'm taking my NYX cream blush in
boho chic and applying this to my cheeks
just to give my face a little subtle
glow and then I'm just filling in my
brows with my ELF brow gel because they
were needing a little bit of work so now
I'm taking my sin a primer sample or
applying this to my lids and then I use
a NYX jumbo eyeshadow pencil in
strawberry milk it's kind of a pink
color and I put this on my lids as well
in my Naked 3 palette I used two of the
more peachy color shades and I put those
on my lid I don't really remember what
they're called but that's what I put on
my lid and then I used my Naked palette
and put naked in the crease because it's
my favorite crease color and then I took
some of the darker colors in the Navy a3
palette and apply these to my outer
corner because just a my face a little
bit of definition and then I blended all
of this together so it looks clean then
I just blend my eyes with a brown
eyeliner this one's from Sela and then I
curl my lashes and apply my all-time
favorite mascara which is the rocket
mascara I just did a coat of that
and then lastly I'm just using this
covergirl pink tinted lipstick balm type
thing just to get my lips a little bit
of moisture in color so that is it's for
the makeup step three is hair now I will
be curling my hair with a straightener
which is different but it's really easy
and I'll show you guys how to do it so
I'm just sectioning off my hair all you
do is clamp down the straightener flip
the hair over twist it and then glide
down it does take some time to get used
to but once you do the curls turn out so
pretty and soft and I love them again
what you do is clamp down flip the hair
over twist the straightener and then
glide down it does take some getting
used to but I promise it's so worth it
it's so pretty in the curler just
different than if you use an actual
curling iron so then I just hair sprayed
it and ran my fingers through and I did
this again did this to the rest of my
hair into the same thing hairspray that
ran my fingers through just to make it
more natural and not so perfect if you
know once it's for the hair step four is
the outfit
now I don't know about you guys but
whenever I go somewhere it takes me so
long to pick out an outfit so this is
kind of the struggle that I go through
every single time I pick out my outfit
and then there's that moment when you
finally find the perfect thing so the
dress that I'm wearing is from choies I
will link it down below I absolutely
love it it's just black and it's very
fitted and comfortable it's kind of
short but it's so pretty and then my
shoes are these ballet flats from Target
they're just nude and then my necklace
is from Etsy and I can't find the link
so I apologize but yep that is
everything for my outfits I love it step
5 is to take a deep breath
I know sometimes going on a date is
nervous so this is something that is
essential in step six is to have fun
because honestly that's all that matters
so I hope you guys enjoyed this and I'll
see you guys my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
