you along with me as I get ready for the
day but this is going to be a fall
version of this also the brushes I'm
using in this video are from pure wet
makeup so I will link it down below
so first I'm just starting off with my
fit me foundation I absolutely love this
I've used it in a lot of videos but I
absolutely love it it's amazing and then
I'm taking my liquid powder foundation
from L'Oreal and using this under my
eyes as concealer and taking a big
fluffy brush I am dusting my powder
which is the stay matte powder all over
my face then using the blush brush I'm
applying a kind of mafia peak color
blush as a primer I'm using my NYX jumbo
eyeshadow pencil and milk but it's
depotted and then I'm taking a few
different of the eye shadow brushes and
you see my Naked basics palette I'm
putting a cream color on my lid a taupe
color in my crease and then a dark brown
color into the very outer corner so it's
very simple then let me see my ELF cream
eyeliner it's my absolute favorite
eyeliner it's so easy to use and it
stays on all day and then lastly I'm
just using my mascara from Maybelline
it's the one by one
and then for lips I'm taking my ELF
mineral gloss and sorority girl which is
a mauve color so here I'm just giving it
very simple I'm just brushing it out and
straightening the pieces that are more
wavy because I know my hair is naturally
very straight so I'm just straightening
a few pieces here and there and that is
it for hair and makeup
and so for outfits I work from this to
this my scarf is from forever 21 it's
very comfortable and soft and then my
sweater is from urban outfitters it's
just a maroon color and then my boots
are from Steve Madden and then my purse
is from brandy melville so that is it
for this video and I hope you guys
enjoyed and I will see you in my next
one so bye and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
