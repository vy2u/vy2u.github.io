hi my friends its Michelle and today I'm
going to be doing a getting ready style
video for prom since I'm gonna let you
guys them I'm a secret this isn't
actually prom it's actually my dance
team banquets but it's pretty much as
formal as prom it's not even more formal
so I titled that so you guys would maybe
like understand what this video is
however I am going to my school's actual
prom so let me know what kind of video I
should do for that if I should do like
another getting ready video or I don't
really know I know a lot of you watch
these videos so if you are new don't
forget to subscribe because I'd love to
have you guys in my little family of the
swag lien shows that was really weird
yeah definitely like this video as well
if you love getting ready videos for
prom because I watch these so often
they're just very cool to watch I
believe that is everything I have to say
for this little intro so let's just go
ahead and get into it so starting off
with makeup I use my Smashbox primer
water this really refreshes my face and
prepares it for makeup I use the
balletto airbrush system for my face
makeup I've used this for three years it
rocks it's super easy to use and it
looks great in pictures all you do is
put your foundation in the little tubey
thing and then you spray it on your face
and it gives this very clean look and it
gives you a very flawless definition to
your face I swear by this because like I
said I've used it for three years now
and it is honestly just the best for
under eyes I use my instant age rewind
brightener this just brightens my look
also hoping and pictures and I just
blended this out with my Beauty Blender
sponge
now I just set the concealer with my
Revlon Colorstay powder but you don't
need a lot because the airbrush system
really doesn't make your skin look oily
or anything
I use the Behr blossom blush and you
really have to be careful with the blush
because it can look streaky if you don't
do it right so just concentrate be close
to the mirror and really work on it then
I just set the blush with my Tarte one
in peacefull I wanted my skin to be a
little bronzy so I added my Rimmel
bronzer in sun bronze it's one of my
favorites and I just kind of contoured
put this on my forehead and all that
good stuff then I just set it all again
with the primer water and this kind of
locks all the face make up in her
eyebrows I just outlined my brows with
my benefit brow gel and then I actually
went in and filled them in with my
Anastasia brow Wiz pencil after I near
my face makeup I got my hair done and
honestly had like no time to fill my eye
makeup so I didn't do that but I will
have it linked down below the tutorial
that I watched and it's basically the
same exact look certainly on our way to
get my hair done now I wanted to do an
updo and I cannot do a formal updo for
the life of me so I went and got it done
and this is kind of a local friend of
mine who did it she actually sewed the
updo in I've never heard of this but it
stayed all night and it looked very very
pretty and you didn't have to use bobby
pins so I definitely recommend finding
someone who knows how to do like a
sewing up too because they're awesome
and I'm never going back to a normal one
again so I know that not everybody can
go out and get their hair done so I
created this really simple braided
hairstyle for you guys I started off
with the new me argan oil which makes my
hair super soft and less frizzy and also
acts as a heat protectant I also use the
5 in one kit which is great because I'm
switching around the barrels but I don't
have to buy another curling iron so I
did this in sections and I started out
with the biggest barrel and I did these
two the smaller or the longer pieces and
then I used the 25 millimeter to the
next section and lastly I finished off
with the 19 millimeter on the top
because this makes the most tight curls
and gives the top a lot more volume
then I just finished off the look with
some hairspray and I took two of the
front pieces of my hair and just did a
normal braid all the way down and then I
secured it with an elastic at the end
and after that I thicken the braid by
just pulling apart some pieces I love
doing this because it really makes it
look better in the back then I pulled
each strand across and pinned it and
kind of tried to hide the bobby pins in
and do a great job but I tried which is
all that matters I absolutely love these
curls because they last all day and into
the next day so you have super awesome
second day curls I also got a couple of
coupon codes for you guys prom time gets
you 40% off all hot tools and free
shipping to the US and then dance away
gets you $100 off a curling one set so
I'll have those down below and you
should definitely check them out my
dress is from the brand Alice Paris and
it's definitely my favorite dress I've
had so far because it was so comfy and
nude and classy and I honestly loved it
so much the mermaid style is my absolute
favorite so this one is just right up my
alley
and then my shoes are from Macy's and I
found them on sale so go me but they
were just some sparkly gold heels
that's pretty much it for my getting
ready prom video and I really hope you
guys enjoyed this and here are some
pictures that you guys might want to see
so I really hoped you guys liked this
video I had so much fun making it and I
had such a good time at my face don't
forget to subscribe and maybe check out
