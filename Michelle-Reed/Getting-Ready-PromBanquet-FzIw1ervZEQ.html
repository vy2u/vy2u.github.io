guys along with me as I get ready for my
banquet which is pretty much as formal
as prom so that's why I called it prom
so I hope you guys enjoy this video
so first I'm priming my face with this
Revlon Photoready primer just so my face
looks decent in pictures and it's ready
for mica then I'm using my airbrush
system so I'm using the balletto
foundation and creme de la and I'm
applying two layers of this to my face I
love airbrush makeup because it looks
really really smooth in pictures and
it's honestly just a better option for
me then I'm using my Garnier roller ball
underneath my eyes to conceal my dark
circles like usual and then also like
usual I'm just setting all of this with
my stay matte powder because I love it
so much and I'm using the blush in vert
blossom and applying a couple drops of
this to my face to my cheekbones
and then I like to set the blush with a
powder blush so I'm just using this Mac
one it's kind of a peachy pink color
then I'm just filling in my eyebrows
with my ELF eyebrow kits to prime my
eyes I'm using the Urban Decay eyeshadow
primer in Eden and then applying this
Maybelline kind of champagne colored
base to my eyelids
then I used sealless kitten all over my
lid and kind of did this in a patting
motion so I didn't get any fallout and
then in the crease I used this taupe
eyeshadow from one of my 88 color
palettes then I applied gilded gold and
luster to my outer corner and applied a
little bit of this black color and ebony
to my very outer corner
and then I make sure there's no harsh
lines I think it's important to blend it
all out so I'm using this little
blending brush that I got from pure wet
makeup and then I did a kind of subtle
cat eye mascara but I can't do it on
camera so that's why I just did it here
then I'm taking those same brown shades
and kind of running it along my lower
lash lines to give it kind of a smoky
look
and I'm just curling my eyelashes and
applying my very favorite rocket mascara
but I use the waterproof kind so it's
stay on all night
and that is it for the eyeshadow her
lips I'm just applying a little bit of
chapstick and then using my lipstick
queen lipstick and pinky nude it's a
very pretty matte nude color just to
keep things simple and clean so yeah
that's it for the makeup I think it's
really pretty and smoky and appropriate
for any formal occasion for hair my
sister used this one-inch curling iron
and she did very structured curls to my
hair and then she would let it go and
put it in a clip while it was kind of
cooling down so the curls stayed in
better so she did this to the rest of my
hair and then kind of teased the top and
put a little bit of big sexy hair spray
in to give it a little bit of volume and
then put it up in a half up half down
style for my dress I am wearing this
really pretty Sherri Hill dress and it
has purple and gold and silver sequins
and then purple ruffles I absolutely
love it it's pretty much me in dress
form and it was really comfortable and
just honestly a really really good dress
my shoes are just these silver heels
from a local shoe store but they're
pretty much just basic formal meals so
yeah that is my dress
and I really hope you guys enjoyed this
I'm gonna insert a few pictures here but
yeah I loved I banquet it was so much
fun so I hope you guys enjoy the rest of
this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
