spring getting ready video so I hope you
guys enjoy so first we're gonna start
out with skincare because I think it's
good to have good skin before applying
makeup so I'm taking my Michael Todd
cleanser and I'm washing my face with
this I love the Michael Todd products
because they're all-natural and they
don't have any harsh ingredients and
they work really well next I'm taking my
citrus moisturizer from Michael Todd and
I absolutely love this because it smells
like the lush store and it's amazing and
makes my skin really smooth so I'm just
applying that
so for makeup starting off with my bare
skin and applying my covergirl state
fabulous foundation I've been using this
for a while and I love it it's not too
thick and gives me the coverage I want
so I'm just applying that and then using
my Garnier rollerball conceal which I
know I use a lot but I absolutely love
it and I swear it's one of the best
concealers I've ever used then taking my
ultimate favorites powders the stay
matte from Rimmel and applying this to
set up these knees then using this
peachy pink colored blush from Mac I'm
applying this to my cheekbones to just
give my face that's settled below now
using the Eden primer from urban decay
I'm just priming my eyes before I apply
any eyeshadow then using the Naked
palette I'm using my half baked
eyeshadow which is a nice shimmery gold
color then I'm just applying a crease
color which is naked from the Naked
palette obviously then I'm putting smog
in the outer corner for a little bit of
definition
and I'm just blending that all out so
there's no harshness then I'm using a
pop of color with this blue kind of
cream eyeshadow for Maybelline and I'm
applying this to my lower lash line and
then curling my eyelashes and applying
my favorite rocket mascara
our lips I'm using my EOS lip balm to
moisturize this is the summer fruit one
and then using this baby lips kind of
reddish pink tinted lip balm for a
little bit of color and that is
everything for makeup sup in my hair I
don't think this messy bun is really
working so I'm taking my hair out and
I'm going to be curling it with my hot
tools wand which I've used a lot but I
love it
basically all I'm doing is wrapping my
hair on the barrel but not holding it
too long because I kind of want more
wavy soft curls so I'm just letting it
go pretty fast and yeah I'm just doing
that to the rest of my hair it's really
easy just very simple not too curly
curls if you know what I'm saying then I
run my fingers through it in hair spray
now I'm just doing this to the other
side of my hand that's it for the hair I
really like because it's very soft and
pretty
the firming outfit I am wearing this
PacSun kind of long-sleeve very soft
comfortable teeth it's floral on the
back it has a floral pocket and I
absolutely love it and my shorts are
these kind of oxford blue chinos from
j.crew and i absolutely love them as
well because they're so comfy and
springy and my wrap watch is from Ellie
Preston in for shoes I'm wearing these
Urban Outfitters sandals
so that was everything for my outfit and
I really hope you enjoyed this little
spring getting ready video and I'll see
you guys my next video bye xoxo the show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
