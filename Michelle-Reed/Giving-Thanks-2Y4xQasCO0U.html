different kind of video just to step
away from a beauty video as you all know
Thanksgiving is coming up and I feel
like sometimes we can kind of get caught
up in the anticipation of Christmas and
we kind of forget to give things seems
like everybody kind of gets caught up in
the materialism of it all and how
they're all excited for Christmas and
sometimes Thanksgiving just kind of
slips our mind and so today I wanted to
do this video and just sit back and tell
you guys what I'm thankful for I sort of
challenge you all to tell me what you're
thinking for as well so just leave a
comment below it doesn't have to be very
long it can just be a couple things or
one thing or 50 things I honestly don't
care it but I just think it's nice for
us to kind of look back and give things
the first thing I think before is my
parents and I cannot even tell you how
amazing my parents are and how much
encouragement they surround me with
tears stories of people who are just not
close to their parents and I can't even
understand because my parents are
honestly you mean the world to me my mom
I kind of just consider my best friend
because I tell her everything and I know
what everybody else kind of gives up on
me she's always there and she's always
helping me through things the parents
are such an awesome image of what a true
marriage looks like my parents love each
other so much and they've worked
together for everything and I can't even
imagine having anybody different to call
my parents secondly it would definitely
be my family I have a pretty large
family I have four symlinks like two
brothers and two sisters and they have
honestly always been my best friends
I've never really been wanted to have
like a whole bunch of friends to
surround myself with and I'm always with
my friends I've kind of just considered
my family my friends honestly it's just
they're basically like my friends and
they're always here for me and they're
hilarious and I do everything with them
and I'm very very close to my sisters
and my brothers thirdly i would like to
be thankful for my friends um going into
9th grade I kinda lost a lot of my
friends if you've watched any of my
videos I think I talked about that but
in ninth grade I met a lot of my really
close friends that I have to
a-and I am absolutely so thankful for
them because they're always there for me
they're always helping me whenever I've
have it that day and they care about me
and I know if sometimes you go through
hard stuff but it's just like they're
always early don't really know people
who are as close as my friends are so
happy to have them there the funnest
people to be around we have so much fun
together but at the same time they're
always there for the more important
stuff as well fourth I want to be
thankful for y'all if you were watching
this video my viewer is my subscribers
it just youtube in general how happy I
am to have it just getting to film and
edit and make videos and inspire others
it's such a crazy opportunity that I'm
so blessed to have and the fact that I
can call this my job and I can do it for
an income is insane and I know a lot of
people don't get to do stuff that they
love is their jobs and the fact that I
do it just it makes me smile know a lot
of people who just don't look at youtube
and be like well that's dumb you're
getting paid to put on makeup in front
of a camera and people say that I'm just
like that's not how it is there's so
many things behind it that make it all
worth more and make it such a
significant opportunity the thing is
that i live in a country where i can
worship freely and i can do what i want
and not be told how to do it i can
worship a God who I love oh so dearly
and I'm not told how to worship you to
worship because I know in other
countries that's not the case and I know
that I'm so blessed and I take it for
granted every single day but I love
getting to worship freely how I want and
what I want to and to think that that
could be taken away from me it's just
crazy so I'm going
for that six I just want anything before
my boyfriend Gunnar and I know that I've
done videos with him in the past I think
of two videos or so but it's honestly a
very great thing in my life and I'm very
very nickel for him it kind of that
little like positive thing in my life
when everything's going wrong I mean him
in YouTube is just like those are the
things that kind of keep me going in
some I just want to say thank you for
him as well seven please that is a word
I thankful that I have food on the table
every night and that I don't have to
think of ways to get food and that is
just something that I always have and I
know that there are children out there
you go to bed starving and I don't have
to deal with that I'm just so thankful
for it's crazy to think that there are
kids going to bed on an empty stomach
and the fact that I don't have to go
through that it's just something I'm
very very thankful for so now that being
said those are just the very few things
that I'm thankful for just the things
that come to my mind I'm sure there are
many more but I just want to say thank
you guys for watching this and I hope
you guys leave your comment all I you
think for down below so yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed watching this and that you
have an awesome thanksgiving with your
families yeah i'll see you guys there
