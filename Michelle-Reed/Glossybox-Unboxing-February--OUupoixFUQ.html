doing my second GlossyBox unboxing for
the month Oh februari this is actually
the cutest box ever it's a Valentine's
themed one so I'm so excited to open
this for the second time because if
we're being honest here I got excited
and I already opened me I know I'm
terrible but still it's fun you guys get
to see what's inside lawsy box is a
monthly subscription service and it's
around twenty dollars a month so have it
linked down below if you want to check
it out and let's just go ahead and get
started so the box has a bunch of pink
roses this time instead of like their
normal like light pink and brown box so
so cute and then it comes with the card
like always we've got some fun
Valentine's themed items and this is
honestly so much better than last month
so this one wrong the first thing we
have in here is the unwashed bio
cleansing conditioner this is just like
a normal conditioner and it says that it
blocks didn't at your oils and color
free of harsh sulfates and parents it's
also moisturizing and nondescript
cleanser so it's not going to strip
everything off your hair this is about a
fifth of the normal size so I think it's
a pretty decent sample and it smells
really good and clean like you know that
typical clean scent this is what it
smells like actually haven't used this
yet but I'm totally excited too next
thing in here is a full-sized julep nail
polish and I never actually tried a
jewel of nail polish oh I'm so soaked
doin ice all this it's a really cute
valentines day topcoat it has some
hearts and sparkles in it so I think
this would be really pretty over like a
light pink or even like a red nail
polish for Valentine's Day these are
actually $14 so they're pretty expensive
nail polish so I'm wondering if they're
good I guess I'll tell you guys if I
like this the next thing in here
actually comes in the cutest package e
it's a titty's lip butter in pink and
it's in this really cute little box so
let's see what I looks like it's a super
cute little like a vintage container so
you can feel cool whatever you're
applying your lip balm so I guess is
just like a tinted chapstick kind of
thing that's what it actually looks like
so I think it's a pretty good color
payoff for liking lip balm because
usually stuff like this is completely
sheared has no colors so
it smells really really good and this is
honestly so cute I thought this is
perfume when I first opened it we've got
two more things in here this is the yogi
flow Indian rose in sweet almond oil
omega shower gel sensation now i did try
this and it's kind of just like a
foaming body kind of wash type thing but
it smells really good it's really sweet
and it's really hard to describe I don't
really like you know how to describe the
symptoms this is a huge bottle this is
definitely a full-size yes this is a
full size and it's $15 super stoked for
that and the last thing in here isn't
actually makeup product which besides
what bomb I haven't seen yet it's the
jelly pong pong very lashes mascara curl
so the packaging honestly isn't all that
cute i mean you know compared to
everything else like the lip balm but
the brush is like a soft bristle lon if
you know what I'm saying and looks like
a pretty black so I guess I can't really
say if I like this or not because I
haven't used it yet but i love new
mascaras and I feel like mascara is
something that you always need because
they're always running dry or whatever
this is actually a $22 mascara so I'm
assuming it's a good brand I've never
tried jelly pong pong I've actually
never tried like any of these brands so
really excited um I'll let you guys know
if I like this or not maybe a favorites
video or something that is everything
you were my glossybox i'm sorry this was
kind of a short video I kind of just
wanted to show you guys this month's box
because I'm going to be doing these for
a little while I believe make sure to
let me know any requests that you guys
have because this coming weekend I've
already planned that I'm going to film a
ton for you guys and I think I may be
doing a morning routine pasa
so like this video if you'd like to see
another morning routine for me or if you
just enjoyed this video and leave me a
comment down below I'll see you guys my
