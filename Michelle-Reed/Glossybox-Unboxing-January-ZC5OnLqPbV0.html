exciting video for you guys because it
is my first unboxing video of glossy box
I have always wanted to try one of these
like monthly subscription services so i
got the opportunity to do so I got
really excited and I took it I have yet
to open this and I'm so excited to show
you guys because I've been kind of
putting off opening this for a week so
it could be like a real unboxing video
for you guys glossybox is a little more
expensive than your typical subscription
service but do not fear my friends I got
you guys some coupon codes so definitely
go down below I think it's about fifteen
percent off your first box so you should
definitely check that out also I think
you can get a free gift if you sign up
in January so simply check it out I am
so excited to open this it's like so so
first off I think we can talk about how
cute the actual boxes it has little
light roses on it and i already cut it
open so i want to waste time doing that
this video so the box itself is super
pretty this light pink color is actually
my favorite boxes make me happy is out
weird like pretty boxes just make things
ten times better like this video if
you're with me on that one because i
sound weird but it's true it's so pretty
when you open it it's all like packaged
nicely and we got this little card right
here this just kind of tells you all the
stuff that's in it so i think we got
about five goodies here i'm going to put
the actual value of all the products on
the screen somewhere so you guys know
how much bang you're getting for your
buck or is it buck for your baby so
here's what everything actually looks
like you get some little black paper
here everything's all packaged nice
sleeve the first thing that I see is a
queen shape here and clean revitalizing
face toner this actually looks really
pretty it's a nice pink bottle it smells
really sweet and very refreshing so I
think you put this on after you wash
your face and it kind of gets off the
excess oil and makeup so I'm not excited
to try this I've kind of stuck with the
same skin care products like all my life
so join something new is going to be
cool because it's 2015 and we're going
to try new things in 2015 the next thing
is
fishy this is literally all in French
and I can't say this even though I'm in
French three that's embarrassing the
vishie one step cleanser for sensitive
skin which is great I don't actually
have sensitive skin but I know a lot of
you watching probably do so this is a
cleansing milk a toner in an eyes makeup
remover I don't know if I would use this
for all three of those things this is a
pretty decent size for a sample size I
think it will give you a good idea of
what it actually does next us see some
makeup my favorite thing this is the
lollipops Paris crayon young 10 you this
is a long-lasting eye pencil in good by
noon and I love me some eyeliner so
let's see what this looks like it is
nice and dark I like that it's kind of
more of like a Kohl eyeliner so it's a
little more faded which can sometimes be
good for like school and stuff so you
don't have super opaque eyeliner on I
believe this is a full-size and it is
1770s so that's almost like the box
value so this is super cool and I can't
wait to use this the next thing we got
here is the skin and coat Tomczyk the
skin and coat truffle therapy serum now
i'm not a huge serum user i honestly
don't really know what they do I'm so
sorry I sound so uneducated but I don't
so i guess we will see it says it
brightens and firm skin on contact fades
fine line softens rough patches and
leaves behind it to be fresh face finish
i actually have a lot of roughness on
this cheat because i only break out here
and every time i do break out its scars
so I think this will be nice to kind of
soften up that area the full size of
this is actually eighty dollars so that
is insane so I think this is a pretty
good sample considering that it is such
an expensive product and of course we
have to do these smell test I just
dropped it again oh my gosh it smells
exactly like coconuts that is awesome if
you've ever tried the Aussie like three
minute miracle hair conditioner this
smells exactly like that so that is
awesome and the last thing I see is the
beautiful eyes flat stood brush so let's
see what this is the packaging looks
really cute from the outside it's a nice
just kind of like shader brush for all
over the lid and you can never have too
many of these so it seems really soft
and I
this is like a full size brush I love
getting new makeup brushes because I
never washed mine and I'd rather just
get you once and wash my brushes that is
everything that we have in this box I'm
really excited because most of the
things in here aren't things that I've
heard of and I like trying out new
things because I feel like we can be
kind of secluded with our makeup and
just use the same brands but I really
really like using most of these I think
a lot of them are actually like foreign
or French I could be wrong but I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
again I will have all the links down
below if you want to check it out and i
absolutely love getting monthly
subscription services because it's like
Christmas once a month everyone and
Christmas all year round is a good thing
right yes right it is make sure to
subscribe if you like this video and
leave me a comment playing me so
feedback on it and i'll see you guys my
next one bye
