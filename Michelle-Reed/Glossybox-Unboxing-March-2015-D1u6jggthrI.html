it in depth GlossyBox video but this one
is going to be for March I have this
glossy box right here but the thing
about this video is I did it a little
differently I tried to engage you guys a
little more basically throughout the
week I tried out these products on a
different day and so you can get more of
a first impression of me actually using
them not really nice sitting here and
holding up a product that I could
possibly not like but say that I like
overall I pretty much liked everything
in the spots except one product which
you'll see so I hope this gives you guys
a better view about GlossyBox
and my impressions of it also I would
like to know that I have a coupon code
for like a free gift down below if you'd
like to check that out and I guess we'll
go ahead and get started with what is in
my glossy book so I just washed my face
so you guys don't really see me like
this my hair is also very crazy but it's
night time this is what I look like so
tonight I am trying the Oracle Cosmetics
moisturizer this stuff actually has gold
in it like actual gold so I have pretty
high hopes for this it's also like $180
I'm just gonna be like totally upfront I
don't think I've ever spent that much on
a moisturizer but I am excited to use it
so we have a little bit of cream right
here so let's just go ahead and turn
yourself
I can tell it's a very big it's a very
creamy thick moisturizer which it's
actually a good thing because right now
my skin is extremely dry the scent is a
little weird I don't really know how to
describe it just kind of like a very
pure Feeny sense but the moisturizer
itself feels awesome very happy about
this and I'm glad I got it actually in
the middle of filming a tutorial right
now so I apologize if you can hear the
autofocus in but I'm about to use the
bellapierre cosmetics blush in cheek
stain this is soo pretty we're pretty
like the bright pink color so I'm really
excited I notice that it is very bright
very bright colors I think it's perfect
for spring it's actually blending into
my skin my skin it's actually blending
into my skin very nicely like it's very
smooth it doesn't take a lot of like
rubbing or anything I really really like
it it needs a nice matte pink blush
color and it'd be great for the
springtime I kind of like a lot of blush
so tonight I am actually using it the me
dad shampoo and conditioner haven't used
these yet
I am excited they actually smell really
good
they just smell like good like salon
products if you know what I'm saying so
really excited I got my dunder-mifflin
shirt on if you watch the office shout
out to you so I guess I will go back to
you guys after I wash my hair and after
I blow-dry it until you guys if I like
it so I just blow dried my hair and my
hair is super soft I don't know if you
can tell but it is just very straight
and soft and honestly it feels great so
I would definitely buy that shampoo
again I think it rocked and I'm happy I
caught it so today I'm gonna try out
these so Susan concealer quad it just
has four different shades in it I think
I probably be this shapes about someone
I'm going to try does that really look
like it's covering that much like I
honestly feel like I'm just wiping like
grease on to my face right now so here's
the eye with no concealer and this one
has concealer so there really isn't a
big difference I think maybe if you
needed a light amount of concealer this
would be good but for me I really like
to cover my under eyes so not really
digging this I do like that it has four
shades now I'm trying the more brows
brow gel really excited because I'm into
like filling in my eyebrows now it's
just a little wand contraption it's a
little bit too dark for my eyebrows
almost a little gray tint to it if you
can see but I feel like I'd like this if
it was my shade the consistency feels
nice but just not this one just a little
bit too dark so does the end of this
video and I really really hope you guys
enjoyed seeing what was in my March
velocity box make sure you go check out
that coupon code down below because I
think that would help you guys out a lot
free stuff is good or discounted stuff
is good and like always I will see you
lovely friends in my next video adios
amigos and let me
goodbye
