doing this spring makeup tutorial
because raise your hand if you are ready
for this nasty weather to go away I hate
it and if it's not going to come soon
I'm going to start putting on my makeup
like it is spring this is one of my
favorite looks to do it's super glowy
it's colorful it's just youthful and I
really like it I think it would work on
a lot of different skin tones and kind
of look good on everybody i also want to
mention that if you want to know how to
get this hair look I've actually done it
in a video already so only get down
below i feel like i may get a couple of
questions on that so we're just going to
go ahead and get into the video of them
to start off this look i am using my
clinic Moisture Surge moisturizer this
is going to ensure that my skin is glowy
because i have all the moisture that i
need to prep for foundation and then i
went ahead and moisturize my lips with
my burts bees chapstick as well for
foundation i used my favorite clean
whipped foundation from covergirl i love
this because it has a very dewy look to
it since it has kind of a mousse texture
and it's great and i just applied this
with my little sponge and for concealer
i use my instant age rewind concealer
from Maybelline
I set everything with my Revlon
Colorstay powder but I did this with a
light hand because you do want to have
that dewy finish and you don't wanna
have a super mattified face or anything
and for blush i use my bellapierre pink
cheek stain this actually came in my
glossybox and i love it because it's the
super bright pink color perfect for
spring and it actually stayed on pretty
much all day so i love it to fill in my
brows I used my Anastasia brow Wiz
pencil in soft brown and then I just
went over it with the spoolie to kind of
blend everything out make sure it's not
too harsh to prime for eyeshadow i use
the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion
and eat in this kind of conceals all the
redness and I also made sure to apply it
to my lash line because we will be
putting eyeshadow there then I just used
my barely branded little face for my
shimmery eyeshadow and then I took my
lorac pro palette and you see shade nude
I applied this to my lid this is a nice
shimmery lid color and I love it and
then I put mob in the crease with this
big fluffy brush and kind of expanded my
crease a little bit above I just liked
how it looked weak algae door Lavery's i
took my coastal scents 88 color palette
and use this kind of goldie purple shade
and i applied this to the outer corner
also a little bit into the crease as
well and then i use a more purple shade
to the very outer corner and i think
this kind of just ties together the
whole look and then i use the white
shade for my lorac pro palette to
highlight underneath my brows for the
lower lash line I applied to purple
colors so this kind of makes the whole
thing pop adds a very springy touch and
it looks great and I use my favorite
eyeliner which is the they're real
push-up liner and i just did a standard
line with this knowing or anything and
then lastly i finished off with my great
lash mascara
for lips I use my NYX soft matte lip
cream in Tokyo it's a very pretty kind
of baby pink color and then I finished
off with these you a lip gloss and
tender because this NYX product can be a
little drawing to my lips so this just
ensures that my lips are nice and
moisturize and that is it for the spring
tutorial
so that is the end of this tutorial I
really hope you guys like this and if
you try it out tweet me a picture on
Twitter or Instagram a picture to me
because I love seeing them you guys
actually recreate the looks that I make
it makes me so happy and I honestly have
nothing more to say even though i really
want to keep talking to you guys are you
guys doing how's your day going are you
doing swell because i'm doing swell and
on that note I should probably go so
i'll see you guys my next video ah it's
dead
