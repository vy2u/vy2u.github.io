video because it is going to be a chit
chat gut running with me video I talked
for like 15 minutes in this video which
I never do but has been such a long time
as I just sat down and told you guys
like how life is going and so that's
what I did in this video grab yourself a
cup of coffee subscribe if you're new
and let's go ahead and get into it
so on one of my Instagram pictures a
while back all of these guys said you
wanted to see what this makeup look was
in a video and so I decided that I would
go ahead and post this for foundation
I'm mixing my Ready Set gorgeous and my
covergirl clean mass BB cream as you can
see I'm so pale right now in New York I
feel like I never really seen the Sun so
as you guys know I went on accutane from
the end of my junior years to like into
my senior year alone for like nine
months because I was getting cystic acne
before that I didn't get them all the
time and they weren't absolutely awful
but it was to the point where I was just
really insecure about my skin I was
tired I getting pimples and for like my
entire senior year my skin was
SuperDuper clear after that I have never
been like more confident that I want my
senior year of high school I feel like
if you have clear skin you don't really
understand but having acne just like
really makes you extremely insecure
about your face because you could be
eating the right stuff getting enough
sleep you'd be getting enough water and
your skin just still breaks out all the
time did a whole entire video about like
my before and after experience and how
much I loved it was a have a link down
below if you want to check out but ever
since coming to college my skin has just
like completely taken a 180 and been the
worst it has ever been obviously I know
in college it's like you have stress you
have things going on I'm not eating the
best diet I'm definitely not eating junk
all the time but compared to what I used
to eat over the summer as you guys know
I'm so so healthy which I am so
relatively healthy but like not the same
I used to be but it's been to the point
where I feel like my sore head is always
bumpy I always have these little like
clogged pores I always have pimples on
my cheeks on my chin I like literally
can never catch a break with my skin in
college and honestly been the biggest
insecurity of mine I feeling I never
really realize like what having like
acne felt like before
till I went to college obviously I know
right now I'm skins in a good period I
can tell you tomorrow like I'll have
like five pistols that will just come up
overnight
no accutane is not necessarily like
guaranteed to cure all your acne but it
was a lot of work and also a lot of
money even with insurance I just feel a
little bit like I got gypped because my
skin is been like a mess it's going to
use my concealer to conceal my eyelids
because they're really really dark and
never get enough sleep in college and
I'm just setting it was a little bit of
loose powder or eye shadow I'm just
going in with my naked by Urban Decay
palette this is the third one I'm just
going to use some of the warmer kind of
purply tones in my crease right here so
I'm officially almost gone it was my
first year of college which is so so
crazy I have finals next week I'm
actually taking a break from studying to
film this College has been like
absolutely not what I would expect at
all I can say I feel like nothing really
like what the way that I saw it going as
far as like school goes I'm definitely
very happy like with my grades and how I
ended in class and gently proud because
I maintain like a GPA that I can say I'm
proud of you're like I've kept up
YouTube like pretty decently kept
uploading consistently next year I'm
still living in this apartment building
that I'm at it's like least through my
school but I just living in a different
room so this will probably look a little
bit different but it's still going to be
like the same kind of stuff I guess the
weirdest part of college has been like
the friendship aspect of things and just
like meeting people in general also
taking the shape nooner I'm going to
apply this in like the inner kind of
crease areas to define things I feel
like I really like took for granted in
high school growing up with people is
kind of like new me more than when I did
on YouTube all my friends in high school
like Noonie honestly before I did all
this stuff and it was never really like
my identifiers I feel like literally in
high school no one really cared that I
did this no one said anything if they
did it like never really got back around
me but obviously I know it takes time
too
actually like get to know people and it
takes time to build friendships what can
you do but overall first year of college
has been great I'm so excited to go home
I feel like being in New York has given
me like a newfound love for Texas I'm
using this Clinique eyeshadow which is
in the shade cream pop it's a really
pretty like shimmering a pan color just
applying this to my lid and then going
in with my concealer this is the instant
age rewind I'm also so excited to get
back into working out back home and just
like getting back on the health kick
before I went to college I was so much
healthier than I am now I worked out
every single day I'm always run I would
always like do my little workouts and it
just like made me a really happy person
overall I feel like working out just
makes you and like a completely
different person I can also say in
college I just straight-up don't have
time to do it like college is so so busy
and hard like balance everything and so
I'm so excited to get back home and just
get back into working out my boyfriend
also lives in the New England area and
so he is very very far and so he's going
to be visiting me over the summer in
Texas which I'm so excited for it's so
fun having people like visit your
hometown and getting to like show them
everything and I am honestly so beyond
excited also too I got ye in like two
weeks which I can not wait for guys I
don't really travel that much and so
this is like one of my biggest trips and
I cannot cannot wait I'm definitely
gonna be filming like blogs and I'm
hoping to do a fashion video and I'm
just so ecstatic so definitely subscribe
and look out for that content I'm going
to be baking with my covergirl

powders let me know what you guys are
doing over the summer I'd love love to
hear you garden plans even if you're
just like working making money like
whatever it may be
let me know down below I'm very much
interested I'm also going to be trying
to upload twice to three times a week
definitely twice a week maybe three
times a week I'm so excited for that too
I'm not going to be trying a new
approach on my channel where I just post
more often and post content that
I want to post things that I feel like
you guys would like and more personal
videos thinking about doing like Monday
advice videos Wednesday like a fashion
video and maybe like on the weekend like
a routine video or something I look so
funky right now so let me know if you
would like that schedule just wishing it
on doing my different content throughout
the week I think that'd be really fun
I'm just going in and I'm kind of
brushing this powder over the rest of my
face for eyebrows I am using my Rimmel
brow this way powder I love this brow
powder in gel I think it's so good if
you're in the need for a drugstore brow
product this is Rox I'm just going in
and kind of fixing up my brow
we're now going is like Clinique pretty
easy liquid eyeliner I love this
eyeliner it is so easy to use and I just
think it looks good I'm just doing a
very thin line my thin line kind of
turned into a thick line but that's okay
and I'm just brushing away all of this
baking powder and getting that
everywhere actually haven't baked in
such a long time I haven't really been
into it just because I never really have
time to like sit and wait for it but ah
makes me miss it makes everything look
so nice for contouring i'm using my holy
grail

chocolate soleil bronzer i've been using
this for a while now I really like it I
have been obsessed with swimsuits lately
