of the most dressed up one my dress is
from American Apparel and then my scarf
is from airy I love it it layers really
really well over this dress and I think
it just adds a nice pop of color I'm
just wearing some sheer tights from
Duane Reade yeah super classy I know my
jacket is from Zara and then these
knee-high boots are from Nine West and I
really like this outfit because it is
dressy but at the same time it's
probably one of the most comfortable
ones and I think everything just really
fits together
my second outfit is a bit more casual I
am just wearing this denim jacket which
is from a local thrift store in New York
and then my scarf is from Steve Madden
and my sweater is from Urban Outfitters
this hat is like my favorite hot ever it
is from Zara I think it just adds such a
cool touch to any outfit my jeans are
just some black high-waisted jeans from
Madewell
and then I'm just wearing these shoes
which are Lauren by Ralph Lauren
so this outfit is a lot of black so it's
definitely more me because I do wear a
lot of black and neutral colors but I
think it's comfy and really cozy for
winter this has probably been my most
go-to outfit just because it's so easy
and simple but it's very warm for the
winter time and just overall really
really practical now this outfit is
definitely me with the neutral colors
but I did add a pair of heels just kind
of add a little something it's still
really comfortable because these heels
are so comfy my sweaters from brandy
melville my little necktie is actually
from Urban Outfitters my cardigan is so
so comfy and cozy it is from the brand
and Taylor Loft my jeans are made well I
really really like neckties because I
think they just add like a little bit of
pizazz to any outfit kind of like a
flight attendant vibe but I really dig
it for some reason and though my shoes
are just these velvet heels which are
from DSW which are so comfortable guys
the chunky heel works wonders
and I think overall this office just
really flows nicely so this last one is
by far the comfiest I am wearing this
huge turtleneck sweater which is from
Free People it's so comfy guys you could
probably get away with wearing it with
tights too it's awesome
I'm wearing those same made while black
jeans and then my shoes are definitely
the focal point for this outfit they are
originally from ModCloth but they're the
brand Chinese Laundry and I cannot get
over them guys they're so cute not the
most comfortable shoes but beauty's
paying guys they are so cute and I think
they just definitely add so much to this
outfit and that is all for my comfy go
to winter outfits video all of the
outfit pieces will be down below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
