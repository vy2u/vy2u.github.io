grandparents because you guys really
seemed to like them last year so we're
doing another slang video part two so
I'm going to ask them what current slang
terms mean and they're going to guess
also if I get the definitions a little
bit wrong it's okay this is just from
urban dictionary you guys ready yes
yeah the first term is swerve just word
by the way this crazy guy yes that's
literally what sort to me basically it's
whenever someone's being really annoying
or like you're really tired somewhere
just like swerve it away so kind of yeah
but what does stay in your way kind of
day where you belong and don't be
getting over my right it's like whenever
a guys hitting on like your girlfriend
or your girlfriend
and on the other guy it's like whoa stay
in your lane various and grants are
pretty close we'll get to both
girlfriends so I may have done this one
in the last video but what does on fleek
your horse's name flaking
say on the plate on before that I'm like
Lindsey those eyebrows they're on fleek
close enough okay this one is low
appropriate but it is a thought each
letter stands for something
think of an inappropriate word that
starts with an age it is also a
gardening instrument yes where were
these hoes that the hoe over
there yes that was both of them every
mile out the word but get John I know
grandma looks at Instagram so she might
know this one what is WCW stand for like
hashtag WCW woman camp women can so
organize women Oh what is w Express
Wednesday yeah you like somebody
yeah
what is a catfish catfish is the bottom
12 or so unless somebody hangs out on
the bottom it's like someone who
pretends to be someone that they're not
so they go online maybe post like these
really good selfies and you seem like
they're saying you know it's kind of
hard zero chill what does it mean if you
told you of zero chill that means you
don't have it don't have a chill man
zero chilly flipping out zero to use a
reel and VP does that mean you the man
you the man you know you though
MVP like someone does your favor so I'm
gonna either real MVP you
yeah a selfie stick
what is a selfie stick let's say you
take pictures of yourself with the long
rod that you see my grandma I'm good at
that one night

squad I think hey what's down you're
famous no that's good yes that's my
family that's my my government game yes

the end the very popular dance mood
