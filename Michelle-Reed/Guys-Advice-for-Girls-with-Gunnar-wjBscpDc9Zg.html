with my pride and joy I am here with
Gunnar and favorite he doing like eight
guys advice video but from a guy's point
of view because I think that's nice that
I'm a guy
make sure to give this video a like if
you want videos with Gunnar because
pretty sure must show you guys do but if
you want more gotta have those lights so
I'm pretty sure that's everything that
we have to say so let's go ahead and get
into it
should the girl makes the first move
normally guys make the first move
because we're supposed to like come out
and be like babe I like you interaction
wise I think it can be like either way
cuz if you like say you have a class
with someone they're like growing you
just want to be fronting like go up you
could be like hey what's up the first
move like dating so like a girl was like
the first one in text I know that's a
big question like should the girl be the
first one in text I think that's fine
yeah I think that's fine Billy the
person that you're trying to talk to is
it may be much response yeah yeah not
like semen real into it and you might
want to like back off and reassess the
situation angry I didn't start a
conversation with a guy now I don't know
if this means like over text or in
person if I'm just gonna answer both I
am NOT a very like start the
conversation kind of person you're
doubly more I've done he's really good
at that I'm not too so I think you
should Oh
okay we're humans to have likes and
dislikes come up you like it what's up
my name is Judy what's your name you got
a competition go talk about yourself
awesome stuff but they might be
interested in our questions is a good
thing because people find it really easy
to talk about themselves under back so
just keep asking questions I'm sure
they'll ask you my questions back if you
got a class with them like I said
earlier the goal will be like eight I
completely don't know what I'm doing
even if you do or I don't have a pencil
I need a pencil works every time
how do you know this the next question
is what do guys usually do when they
like a girl will start talking to that
girl and like make the conscious effort
to get to know them and try and like
I'm bad at that well try and get to know
ya why are guys such cool bases next
question the next one is what do guys
look for most and growth personality
each guy like lights different things
girls like for Michelle she's really shy
quite tryna be quiet
I like that about her because I would
like to talk a lot and if I was dating
something I talked a lot we get into
some some classes here and there but she
just lets me just go on and on about the
most random stuff but I like to like
hearing stories yeah I mean each guy
looks for different things I mean
there's not really like one true thing
that they look more just like be
yourself and great like oh what do you
do if you are friends if you are a
friend zone I don't really think there's
something you can do about it I don't
think you should change yourself to be
like the person that they would like I
think you should accept this guy just
wants to be friends
it sucks like I think we can all say
that it sucks but that's what
how do you friends Oh a guy without
being harsh just straight up saying hey
I think we should be friends I think
this whole videos just been like be
straightforward but like there's no
other way to do things
you just have it they can't be around
the bush and did that friendzone out
like hey I just want to be just friends
or you're gonna end up dating someone
that you don't like this walked off
gonna be talking the arm for the guy
thought the girl pay for dates
I don't want Michelle take her stuff
because it's me taking her out on a date
I mean even if she offers sometimes I'll
be like hey I'll like treat you to
something in turn ups and turn ons for I
guess like girls like guys upper girls
so I can't answer this to my guys one
turn off trussing when you turn on humor
if you have a good sense of humor and
you can laugh at yourself for in jokes I
mean
Oh what is it good gift to get your
boyfriend I mean every guy is different
so you can't just say like get in this
because you know maybe he's not
interested
like Michele got me this like cord
catcher that you put on my bed or your
desk and you put your cord service so
they don't fall off and I use that with
my family for cords in that and it's
greatly not it's something small but I
like I love it I mean practical things
are a lot better than getting your light
pumpkin I would look I'm not yeah I
would just say like think of things that
they would actually use on an everyday
basis and no fines so we are kind of
like drenched in sweat so not here so
we're gonna go droughts yes I really
hope you guys enjoyed getting some
advice from Gunnar I think it's great to
have a guy's point of view and very
happy he came in joining us today make
