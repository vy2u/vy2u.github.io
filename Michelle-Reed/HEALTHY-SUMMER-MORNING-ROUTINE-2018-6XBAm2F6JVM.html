make some lifestyle content here on my
channel and I think my friends over at
the great courses Plus for sponsoring
this video in college I posted quite a
few of these kind of like morning
routine vlog style videos night routine
vlog style videos you guys really liked
them and so I decided to do one while I
was home this is gonna be my healthy
morning routine while I am on break I
think that these are a lot more genuine
than just setting up a camera but I'm
also mixing in some other shots as well
so you guys don't get too bored make
sure to subscribe if you are new to my
channel let me know if you like these
more vlog style videos I want to show
you guys my healthy breakfast me working
out what my skincare routine is recently
how I like to feed my soul in the
morning I usually wake up around 7:45 in
the morning I like to wake up before
8:00 I usually hang out on my bed for
about like 15 minutes or so I will go my
phone I will see kind of what I have on
my to-do list so let's just go ahead and
get right into it
so I then just roll on out of bed and
I'll go ahead and start heading into the
kitchen after I make my bed I mean by
bed basically every single morning I
think it really starts your day off
right I know I say that all the time but
guys it's important I really like this
Colombian instant coffee from Trader
Joe's it's so good thighs I love it
happening so I like to come back in my
room with my cup of coffee I know I
probably should be drinking like lemon
water and apple cider vinegar but I'm
just gonna be honest this is how I start
my day so it's about 8:30 at this point
this is what I usually like to sit down
and kind of get my mind straight and
figure out what my goals are for the day
I like to first just read my Bible for a
little bit and pray and then I will map
out my day and my planners all the
different things that I have to get done
because even though it's summer I still
like to be productive it's really
important to me if you guys watch my
vlogs you know I like to work hard
especially in the summer because you're
never gonna have as much time as you do
I like to turn on some worship music
this is and I'll called tell all my
friends I've been listening to it lately
and I really like it and I just think
it's nice to do while I read my Bible I
need to finish this morning routine
video that I'm filming right now I need
to pack up my stuff because I'm going to
Boston tonight and then I'm also taking
an entreprenuer class that I really
really like and so I need to work on day
4 so I'm taking it online class right
now but I also just kind of wanted to
keep learning over the summer and
there's so many YouTube things that I
wish I could do but I feel like I don't
really know how to start so I found this
course through the great courses plus I
was actually watching another college
youtuber and she was mentioning this
company I was like so cool and then they
reached out to partner with me basically
the great courses plus is a subscription
on-demand learning service so they have
tons and tons of online lectures from
like top-notch professors people from
like Ivy League also just general
experts some people from like National
Geographic
it was a huge library and there are over
10,000 video lectures about basically
everything so math history I'm currently
taking a class that is called the
entrepreneurs toolkit and it's so cool
because it gives you all this practical
advice to starting your own business and
it's taught by Professor Michael G
Gold's be taking ideas that you have in
your head and actually implementing them

so it's not my favorite time in the
morning it's breakfast time I cannot go
like an hour past making out without
eating breakfast so I'm about to go make
some oatmeal I usually make either
avocado toast a smoothie bowl yogurt and
granola but this morning I'm really
feeling like a hearty bowl of oatmeal so
for my oatmeal I just take some normal
instant oats and I will combine it with
my milk also adding some chia seeds just
to get some protein I always like to
make wine over the stove I also just cut
up some peaches to add into my oatmeal
as well and I'll just cook this up add
in some peanut butter and there you have
the best bowl of oats so nourishing so
good for your body
so usually in taxes it's like 100
degrees and so hot even at 9:00 a.m. we
had a really nice thunderstorm and so
now it's like 85 degrees so I decided to
come out here and work on my vlogs I try
to upload my blogs by like 10 a.m. every
morning and so I like to come out here
and just finish up you guys want to
check out my blog channel it is Michelle
out of her shell if you like this video
you probably like those videos as well
also my oats are so delicious
I haven't eaten oats in such a long time
so I just got changed to go to the gym
I'm about to go work out I usually work
out at about 9:30 to 10:00 every morning
if you guys want to know what exactly I
do at the gym make sure to watch my last
video it was a week of my workouts and
you'll actually see like what I actually
do at the gym and what I do weekly let's
just go they get a nice sweat in so I
always go to the gym with my sister
Jamie we basically do this every single
morning and it's kind of our ritual
so I used to only wash my face at night
but I actually started washing it in the
morning time as well because my skin has
been breaking out a lot I just popped
this pimple but I'd like to start off
with my bio clarity cleanser I know this
sounds sponsored it's not I did a
sponsored video with them and I've just
been using this for a while so I'm gonna
go ahead and wash my face with this and
then use my collagen this is a nutrition
toner from its skin and then just
moisturize with my Clinique Moisture
Surge this is my favorite moisturizer
ever for makeup I use my Becca
shimmering skin Perfector liquid before
hand and then I'll use my Clinique
lightweight foundation I'll use my Laura
Mercier concealer over top and all my
pimples under my eyes I'll set
everything with my Laura Mercier powder
and then just like to take some bronzer
this is the Tarte Park a princess one I
will carve my face and do all that good
stuff and then just apply a little bit
of my Physicians Formula blush and then
also my Anastasia glow kit to my
cheekbones my nose my chin my forehead
I'll fill in my brows with just a little
bit of eyeshadow because my brow pencil
actually ran out right now and then I
just did kind of a light eyeshadow look
with my Naked 3 palette align my eyes
with my eye liner and then just applied
some mascara and then firm lips I used
my Tarte lit me lingerie in the shade
whisper her hair all I do is really
straighten it lightly and fold in the
ends and it kind of creates this shape
that frames your face and it's really
easy I was just going to the airport so
my outfit was simple I threw on this
target hoodie which kind of reaches in
the back super cute and also just my
Lululemon leggings
so it's basically for my healthy morning
routine I hope you guys enjoyed this
