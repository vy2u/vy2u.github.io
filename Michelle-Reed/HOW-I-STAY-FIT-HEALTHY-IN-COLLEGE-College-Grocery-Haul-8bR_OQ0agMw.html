video because I haven't done this in a
long time but I'm going to be doing a
college grocery haul I think grocery
shopping is kind of difficult when you
first start and I've watched so many
Trader Joe's homes because I love to see
what people buy if you are a nerd and
really enjoy grocery shopping to give
this video a thumbs up and let me know
down below where your favorite place to
grocery shop is eating healthy is so
important for me I'm the kind of person
whenever I fill my body with healthy
things I feel healthier and I can focus
on things that I need to achieve I just
think that health and eating is so
important in college especially you want
to make sure you're getting enough
energy and you want to make sure that
you are being healthy even though you're
cooking your own meals
I love Trader Joe's I know not everyone
has one but if you do I highly recommend
them because they are affordable and
they also have just really cool options
and if you're cooking for a small amount
of people I think Trader Joe's is
especially good and I'm gonna save your
cooking for one I think this stuff's
great they have a lot of single serving
stuff which is awesome
I spend about ninety dollars at this
trip which is a lot of money when I only
go every couple of weeks or so and so
I'd rather get a lot of stuff at once
then go every single week just because
it's still kind of a commute for me and
I still just like to stock up I recently
tried to start eating more protein as
well so I'm a pescetarian and you fish
the first thing I don't like to mine a
ton of processed stuff but I like to buy
like one process thing usually whenever
I go and so I got the multi green
petabyte crackers because I think I'm
gonna try to make comments after I film
this video I got two things of the
organic herb salad mix this is my
favorite salad from Trader Joe's and I
eat a lot of this I like to put it in
bowls of rice I like to meat salads I
got some shredded carrots because again
I'm trying to make better salads and so
I'm trying to find more veggies for them
as well I also got some avocados I
usually just use these for avocado toast
or add them on to salads or I will add
it onto like little bowls so they like
to be you guys would like a video with
easy college recipes for like breakfast
lunch and dinner let me know down below
I also got the tomato basil marinara
sauce because I recently right now
this song I got some roasted red peppers
because like I said I'm trying to make
my own hummus and it may be a fail but I
think that these will make it better I
got to speed potatoes so I eat a lot of
sweet potatoes these basically go and
everything you can chop them up and make
fries you need a baked sweet potato you
can add them as a side onto something I
also got a can of white kidney beans
because I want to try to make avocado
toast with like a bean paste underneath
and it's a good source of protein so I
thought I'd try it out got a thing of
bananas I eat bananas all the time I'll
freeze them for smoothies or I'll just
eat them alone other thing a frozen
cooked shrimp I think like frozen struck
tastes pretty good and I make a lot of
stir fries with veggies on them with
rice because I think the shrimp is
pretty tasty I got some falafel I've
never tried the Trader Joe's wha-ho but
I thought that it might be good again
just to get some chick pea protein in
and I think my bra keeps showing this
video and I'm sorry but I'm not gonna
refill this so if that's bothering you
I'm sorry I also got to think of
blueberries I eat blueberries with
oatmeal and I'll eat their laptop
smoothie bowls I also got the butternut
squash ravioli I love this I had this
one my sister Janie came in town I like
to eat a ton of pasta but I do think
that that pasta is good I also got some
raw walnuts because I'm gonna put these
in some salad I got a can of garbanzo
beans I also got another one of these
because I need this for the hummus I
also got two lemons
I got Greek yogurt I think Greek yogurt
is really good and I'm not vegan so I
EFA's I love the taste of Greek yogurt I
know it's kind of bitter for some people
but I think it's really good and then I
also just got some sliced pineapple
because I like to put this into schools
I got some fresh Atlantic salmon I eat a
lot of salmon I think salmon is so good
I'm gonna cut this into two and then
how's this for two nights I've mentioned
a really good salmon recipe and my
productive night routine you should
check it out it was so good also just
really easy to make so I have it quite a
bit
I got Q little Tomatoes a Honey Crisp
apple because honeybees apples are
objectively the best apples out there I
got two things of frozen mixed berries I
eat very bowls so much I try to add
protein powder into them but whenever
I'm feeling fruit I love these and
they're
tried this but I got the white bean and
kale veggie jelly slices because I
always wanna make sandwiches but it's
really hard when you don't eat like
chicken or turkey so I thought I'd try
these I also got a couple of cloves of
garlic I wanted to try out some
non-dairy yogurt so if you're vegan I'm
trying this is the coconut milk
blueberry yogurt
I got a blueberry one and I also got but
no I just had try I got beefless ground
beef I like to make taco salads and I
think that this tastes pretty good it's
not that bad for you it doesn't have a
ton of sodium or anything it also has a
decent amount of protein so I got cowboy
caviar which is basically just beans and
corn I love to add this on an avocado
toast then I also got some raw almond
butter that is it for my grocery haul I
hope this gave you guys some ideas don't
forget to leave down below where your
favorite place to grocery shop is down
below
I love you guys and I will see you guys
