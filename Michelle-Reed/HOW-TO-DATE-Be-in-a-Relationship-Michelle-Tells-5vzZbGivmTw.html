the weather this week and so I decided I
would just sit down and film a talking
video with you guys because it's really
going outside and I didn't want to go
out and film something a little more
intense whenever I just feel kind of bad
today's video is going to be a Michelle
tells video which is my advice series
basically I go on Instagram which you
should follow me on and I will ask for
questions and this week's theme is going
to be relationships and guys and dating
because I get a lot of questions on this
since I have been in a relationship for
the past two-and-a-half years so I feel
like I know a thing or two about dating
and I feel like I have some good advice
to give you guys I also wanted to do a
little side note that on my blog channel
I'm going to be vlogging a lot more in
2016 and I absolutely love logging so if
you're interested in knowing more about
my life and what I do on a day to day
basis go follow me on there it is
Michelle out of first shell you can go
click right here and subscribe or you
can move down below it will be one of
the first links and yeah I really hope
you guys are excited to just grab a cup
of coffee and have a little advice chat
with me the sky is the limit asked what
is the best age to start dating I think
it varies from person to person I don't
think there's a set age that like when
you turn 16 or 17 you should start
dating it is about it's about the person
and what their specific preferences are
I know a lot of people want to date one
person and marry that person I know one
person may want to date a ton of people
and then find something that works for
them so definitely varies from person to
person I just think you have to be
mature enough to handle relationship
until you can actually get court
short-ass do you believe that opposites
attract or do you think it's better to
date someone that you share a lot of
interest with again I think it varies
from person to person dating is
definitely something that is specific to
a person I know so many people are
opposites and they just work really well
together I think that's how Gunnar and I
are we are quite different but there are
some things that we share beliefs on and
that we share an interest in so I don't
think you necessarily has to be
opposites or you have to be exactly the
same I am definitely more of a quieter
person and I loved listening and
observing people and Gunnar's definitely
more of the talker likes to tell stories
and we mix really well in that way
there are other ways that we are more
similar savanah pills us how do I deal
with everyone dating just anyone in high
school when I'm waiting for someone who
is genuine I would say to hold out I
don't think there's any point in just
dating someone to date someone that's
ridiculous I know in high school it's
like everyone has a boyfriend and
everyone has a girlfriend and it's just
kind of like the thing to do but and
people are pretty open to that I've
never seen someone really judge other
people for that reason I think it's all
just a personal opinion and if you want
to wait to date someone then you can
some Christian hmmm asked how should you
tell someone you like them and you were
super good friends with them I know this
is really hard for a lot of people they
don't just want to come out and say they
like someone cuz they're afraid of
breaking a friendship but I think you
should just ask them if you are friends
with them they genuinely will care about
you they would want you to be happy if
you are in a really good friendship with
this person they're not going to cut you
off just because you told them that you
like them I don't think that's how it
works and you shouldn't be too scared to
tell someone that you like them because
you deserve to know and that's just my
personal opinion I know a lot of people
disagree with that but just personally I
think we have the right to be happy and
if it's going to make you happy to know
if someone likes you you deserve to ask
crystal fiha asks do you think it's
important for your partner to have the
same beliefs as you I know different
people are gonna say different things on
this this is just my personal opinion
I'm not telling you to think like this
but there are certain things that I
would want the person that I'm dating to
be on the same track with me on with
religion and stuff that's just something
that personally I would want my
boyfriend to share that with me because
it is so important if you see yourself
receiving a long-term relationship with
this person I just think it's wiser to
go with someone who shares that beliefs
but on other things like political
stance just like day-to-day things I
don't think they necessarily have to
believe the exact same as you Rob but
there are certain things that I would
want my boyfriend is share I know not
everyone's going to agree with that and
that's fine that's life but that's just
me personally
NEC 515 s self-confidence what is it too
much and when is it not enough I think
self-confidence is so important
especially in dating before you ever
date anyone or go in a long-term
relationship make sure that you have the
self confidence in yourself and that
you're not relying on that person
to build your confidence up I see a lot
of girls who are really insecure go into
relationships thinking that this guy is
going to praise them and tell them that
they're beautiful everyday and make them
feel good you need to feel good without
having someone else so self-confidence I
don't think is ever too much until it's
the point where it's cocky but I think
you need to be a confident person and
you need to know that you're beautiful
that you're loved and that you are a
valuable person before ever dating
someone or else if you go in with
insecurities and you expect your other
person that you're dating to fix those
insecurities they're not and you need to
be confident before because
self-confidence is awesome and it's
never a bad thing
Verena I'll live IRRI sorry I would sure
that asked what to do when your
ex-boyfriend ignores you when it was his
fault I really like him and I want us to
be friends love you love you too I would
say that you can only try so hard to be
friendly with your ex to a certain point
I mean he is your ex you're not going to
be best friends again I think that's
something you need to accept that you
can only do so much so if you're
friendly to him and you're nice to him
and you let everything go that's all you
can do on your part you can't force
anything in a few does it want to be
friends as well oh well you can find so
many other cool friends who aren't your
ex
despite whose fault and maybe just no it
didn't work out and it didn't work out
for a reason and that's fine and move on
to bigger and better things but never go
so low as to make him feel bad about it
just keeping nice and friendly and if he
doesn't give those actions back to you
and that's it that's all you can do
Emily God asked how difficult has it
been to date while you're in high school
and gunner is in college a lot of people
say it's a long-distance relationship
but gutter is only like 45 minutes from
me so I can't really call it
long-distance but I think it is
different but at the same time we are
both pretty independent people and so we
know how to live with ourselves and not
always have to be together not that I
don't want to be with them every day but
it's not something that like tears me
apart not seeing him every day because
we are used to it and when we do see
each other it makes that time so much
more valuable because we haven't seen
each other in a while
but it is nice seeing him whenever he
comes home or whenever I go up to see
him it just varies I think it just
depends on the person and you have to be
the right kind of people to do it or
else it's awesome so I think those are
all the questions that I'm going to
answer today give this video a like if
