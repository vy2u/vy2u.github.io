today I'm here to do a video all about
college stuff so when we talking about
college applications getting in where
I'm going just like all like the
nitty-gritty of college I just wanted to
put in one huge Q&amp;amp;A so I asked for your
questions on Instagram I just spent four
because I feel like that's the best way
to do this to like see what you guys are
worried about because I'm going to be a
freshman in college if you don't know
and so I kind of wanted to talk about my
senior year and just the whole process
and how I got to go to this school that
I really wanted to go to answer
questions on my Instagram as I always do
so definitely go follow me at Michelle
Reid if you're interested let's talk
about College what are you majoring in I
am Adriene and Business Administration
how many colleges did you apply to I
apply the three schools I applied to
Liberty Christian of the University of
Texas at Austin and the Kings College in
New York City because I pretty much knew
that those were the only ones I really
was deciding between I know a lot of
people apply to like six or ten colleges
but it kind of just depends on what you
want to do what are your tips for
narrowing down your choices of schools
so for me personally I kind of made a
pro/con list of all the schools that I
had and I had things that were the most
important to me to things that weren't
the most important to be for me
personally location was super important
I wanted to go out of state pretty much
I knew I wanted to be a more of an urban
area my second biggest thing was the
size of the school I'm the kind of
person that I'd rather go to a smaller
school I have grown up in a huge public
school and just realize like that wasn't
really for me and then the third most
important was of course like the
programs and I know it's probably
supposed to be like my number one
important thing um but just the programs
making sure I had the major that I
wanted so that's what I would recommend
doing and then you can kind of weigh out
like oh this isn't really in the place
I'd like to go to and that's what I did
and that's where I came to the choice of
the school that I wanted to go to your
test scores determined whether or not
you'll get accepted into your college um
yes and no test scores are very
important so your SAT and your a CT
scores are a big factor but they're not
completely it you know your
extracurriculars your grades in school
your essays those are all big factors on
whether or not you get into your school
so you can ask any school when they're
not going to be like oh you don't have
the score you
can't get it it's usually not like that
it's definitely dependence and if you
look at school charts you can generally
see that the kids make sense all have
different scores for the most part but
that being said though you need to try
hard on these tests because you can also
get scholarship money from them it's
like you get a certain score that's what
I did
so still try hard but know that those
aren't like the only thing that factored
in which was more important to you your
essay or your scores for me personally I
definitely think my essay was more
important especially for UT Austin I was
trying to get into their Macomb school
business which is pretty difficult to
get into so for me personally I do oh my
gosh all these other kids are gonna have
the same test scores as me they're gonna
the same extracurriculars but I found
something that made me stand out and I
wrote my essay on that so for me that
was YouTube I really emphasized YouTube
a lot and I put that so much into my
essay and I truly believe that's the
only reason why I got into that business
school I'm not going to that college but
that school is really really great and I
do think it's because my essay that I
got in is it worth it to save money and
go to a community college or get the
whole experience in dorm at a real
college um for me personally I am all
about saving money but I also know that
investing in your future is really
important so you just have to find a
balance I knew that I didn't want to go
out of college with a ton of debt and
I'm really grateful for my parents for
helping me pay for college and basically
paying for my tuition because I know
that's something that not everyone gets
and if you pay your way through college
I commend you and I'm just saying that I
know it's not easy and it's hard but for
me personally my parents told me you
know you need to get this certain amount
off your tuition Turville so you
probably can't go here and so I worked
my tail off to get scholarships make
sure my scores are right so I would get
a four that I literally did this whole
scholarship competition for the school
I'm going to I didn't get it but I did
get some money from that and so I would
just have to say if money is tight and
you don't have the money to go to a
college don't feel bad
Community College is definitely not like
a bad thing at all you're going to save
so much more money and just coming out
of college without all that debt is so
nice I do think you should invest in
your future but not to the point where
you get out and like you're just swamped
with that because
no one wants to do that so you kind of
just have to pick and choose for
yourself for me personally I would not
want to go to school and have a lot of
debt I'd rather go to Community College
if that was my only option how did you
finalize your college choice I've been
on a bunch of tours but I haven't fall
in love with a specific school so like I
said earlier I definitely had priorities
like location and stuff so basically
when it came down to it I was between
the Kings College in New York and UT
Austin for me UT Austin I got into their
business school which is incredible they
awesome marketing program so that was
the big factor for that school and then
Kings was really small which is
something that I really liked if you
look it up it's not big at all and it's
a New York City which is probably like
the biggest factor and so when it came
down to it I got them two about the same
tuition price almost and so New York
City definitely won and I was like you
know what I feel more at home here and
this is where I want to go not saying
that UT is a bad school so many people
told me like oh you're gonna walk on
campus and you're just gonna know and
well I think that does happen for some
people don't really happen for me it was
really hard for me to choose between
schools
yeah just way like your pros and cons
and you kind of just have to figure it
out for yourself
approximately how long does one
application take to complete this
definitely varies like a lot depending
on the application between like entering
all of your scores and doing your essays
and putting all your information in you
can take quite a bit of time I don't
know like an exact time to tell you I
remember on my UT application I spent
like weeks on that thing that required a
lot more essays in such than my Kings
won my Kings application didn't take
very long I would be completely honest
but it depends on the school if you're
doing like the Common App or an
application process that is more generic
it's probably going to take a little bit
longer I would definitely start now in
August or September in the early fall
time I know some people start in the
summer which is again very very good but
I would try to get those all done before
the end of your fall semester how many
times did you take the a CT / SAT so the
a CT I took twice in the SAT I just took
one time so I know a lot of people take
out like four or five times my a CT
score I got pretty much the score that I
wanted to the first time but I took it
again and it
a point which was good my SAT I just
took once because most of the schools I
want to took either and I just figured
like the AC T was more for me than the
SAT you'll find one is better for you
than the other and so I would find the
one that's better and then retake that
one it's where you get the score that
you what will your College schedule mean
for your filming schedule so basically
my schedule I have class Monday Tuesday
Thursday Friday and all of my classes
are from like 9 to 2 I believe so right
now I'm hoping I have that Wednesday off
that I'll be able to film then and then
maybe in the afternoons but I also know
that school is hard and I'm going to be
so busy so I'm only going to be
uploading once a week I'm pretty sure
but I can't really tell you till I get
there that's just kind of what I
forecasted but I am planning on still
keeping up YouTube
maybe not twice a week uploads because
that is a lot guys know it seems like oh
you just throw up this video but it's
really difficult and for me I'm a
perfectionist I like my videos to look
nice to put together so that's all I
have for you guys today I really hope
this helped you guys out if you're
applying to college let me know down
below what college you go to which one
you want to go to all that good stuff
I'm so interested you should also go
watch my last video which will be linked
on the screen and also follow me on my
social media and I'll see you guys in my
next one
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
