all about how to get what you want in
life something that we all want
basically just talking about motivation
and skills that I think are important to
actually achieve your goals and then
getting what you want is really mainly
something that has to be within yourself
and you really have to want it so I'm
just saying that I do think that I have
ten important tips that may help you
guys along the way if you're new to my
channel I upload every Sunday and
Thursday or Sunday or Thursday of the
week so you should definitely subscribe
also my last video you guys seem to like
the lighting in here so I'm just still
mning another video in here it may not
be for sure like a main spots but I
think natural lighting is nice every
once in a while everyone seems to hate
really long intro so we're just gonna go
ahead and get into the video tip number
one would be to actually ask for what
you want so many times I feel like we
put up these barriers and we act like oh
no this is so silly this is so stupid I
can't just ask for this when in reality
if you just want something try asking
for it sometimes almost be so down on
myself I'd be like oh my gosh always
happens to me and I never get this
people can't read your mind sometimes
you just have to ask them for what they
want and they might give it to you I was
reading hashtag girlboss which is such a
good book it's by Sophia Amoruso I
believe she said this in the book and it
really spoke to me if you're frustrated
because you're not getting what you want
stop for a second have you actually
clawed out asked for it if you haven't
stop complained you can't expect the
world to read your mind
you have to put it out there and
sometimes putting it out there is as
simple as just saying hey can I have
that and the worst thing that can happen
is rejection and they say no and you
move on to something better
sometimes just asking for stuff it's
what we need to do it's something that I
need to get better at number two is
fairly obvious but it is to work for it
success does it come without hard work
it just doesn't you really have to want
something and you have to work hard and
not slack off or put it off or
procrastinate however I do want to
mention a super cool company where you
college students who may like to
procrastinate there's a really cool
website called Bubo learn and they
basically create little notes and study
guides for people who have midterms or
tests or you just want to do better in a
class in college these range in price I
was looking online in summer 3
some are $9 but honestly what is better
to invest in than your education
maybe stop getting Starbucks every day
for the week and get yourself a study
guide so you can get an A I know it's
really hard in college to keep up your
grades because college is so much harder
than high scores so I've heard I am in
high school but lumo learn is just such
a cool company for people who do like to
procrastinate because let's say if
you're out to make a study guide or
notes or something go on there you find
one you like and you study and you get
an A
I have Aluva learns down below such a
cool company I definitely and so for
this I know I'm gonna be using it a lot
next year be a hard work pays off study
research practice until you can actually
get what you want number three would be
to always keep your game on I feel like
a lot of times we have bad days and we
like to say oh today's a bad day so I'm
just going to sit in my bed and watch
Netflix the most successful people don't
let bad days bring them down if you're
having a bad day take it as a sign that
okay I'm gonna work harder I'm gonna
beat this bad day that's the mindset
that I've been trying to have lately
don't get on that flakes or eat a tub of
ice cream go and do your homework or
study or edit a video or whatever that
may be to attain your goals number four
would be to stop complaining this is
definitely the biggest thing is to have
a positive mindset or if you don't get
an opportunity that you really wanted
try to find more opportunities that's
something that I do a brand rejects me
from a business deal say okay I'm going
to find a cooler brand take it as a
challenge
I think negativity is so so detrimental
to hard work and success and you just
got to cut it out and keep a positive
mindset
I know easier said than done but it's so
so important then five would be to write
out exactly what you want I feel like
sometimes we work towards goals that are
really vague and we're just saying oh
hey get better grades get this job etc
write down specifically what you want
have an A in biology get this raise for
my job whatever it may be
write them out and maybe post them on
your mirror or on your planner and so
you have something to look towards every
day number six would be to visualize
what it would be like to get these
schools something that really motivates
me if I'm in this mode of
procrastination I'll just think oh my
gosh imagine how good it's going to feel
to be done with my homework
to have a's and to be getting into
college that's going to be
right feeling it so I look towards that
to motivate me I know this method of
motivation doesn't work for everyone
people were just good okay cool I'm
gonna keep procrastinating but for some
people like myself it definitely is
helpful to think of attaining those
goals all the sweat and tears and blood
doesn't matter because you made those
goals number seven would be to be open
to constructive criticism sometimes
people can see what you need to improve
in more than yourself I feel like a lot
of times will take constructive
criticism as like judgment but it's not
necessarily that to be successful and to
get what you want you need to constantly
be looking for what you can improve in
while recognizing yeah I'm good at this
but hey so once I was a little bit
better than me and this I'm gonna go to
that person and see how I can improve
number eight would be to be thankful
never feel entitled to anything never
feel like I deserve this without even
working I deserve this job because I've
been here for so so long no you don't
deserve anything entitlement is such a
bad mindset to have it's awfully create
envy and jealousy and just anger and
it's so not a good trait to have every
single day write down what you're
thankful for sometimes I will do this
and I'll give myself like five things I
have to write down and I'll put those
down and I'll be thankful for them just
so I keep gratitude into my daily
routine and I'm not always trying to
take what someone else has or anything
you're just thankful and you're grateful
and you recognize the good enough number
nine seems to be kind of like common
sense but make sure you can handle what
you want I feel like a lot of times we
work really hard for something and then
we get it we're like crap I cannot
handle this it seems like common sense I
know but you really need to make sure
you can handle all that pressure and
anxiety and all the stuff that comes
along with having a new job or getting
into a degree that's harder than the one
that you have right now so just make
sure you can handle those pressures but
at the same time push yourself
and lastly study other people who have
what you want to get what you want that
was kind of good easy to say but if
someone has the job that you want maybe
go to them ask some questions figure out
what they did to get that job if you see
someone who has all A's and you're like
hey I want to know how I heal is study
them sounds kind of creepy but I feel
like the best way to be successful in
something is to
people who are successful in that
something so that's everything that I
have to say for this video I really hope
you guys got a few tips I know this like
February March April time of the year is
so hard to push through it feels like
it's never ending but push through it
because we have goals to get if you want
to watch my last video it was a really
fun get ready with me wake up with me
video and I basically show you guys my
everyday makeup routine so I'll see you
