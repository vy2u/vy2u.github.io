being loved allegiance to the pain hi
everybody today I'm here to give you
guys tips on how to have a better day
because I know some mornings I just wake
up and I'm super negative and I'm like
wow this is gonna be really bad boarding
it so I wanted to give you guys some
easy ways to kind of boost your mood
throughout your day and have the best
day I also wanted to be very transparent
and say thank you to origins for
sponsoring this video I love working
with them and you guys always ask me how
I keep my skin clear and it's honestly
origins I love them so excited to be
working with them like always if you're
new to my channel you should definitely
subscribe I upload twice a week and
let's just go ahead and give this video
a thumbs up so we can help other people
have a really good day because I know
it's something that we all strive for
and that's alright bang bang savor this
intro so we're gonna queue the tips
right now
so first I'd recommend starting off your
morning with some skin care I love using
my origin skin essence products origins
recently expanded its quarter life
skincare collection to include these I
first like to use my retexturizing rose
clay mask to wake up my skin and because
I feel so pampered in the morning
whenever I use a mask and after I take
it off my skin is so moisturized and
then I use my skin essence lotions with
a cotton pad after the mask and it
actually uses Canadian willow her to
make your skin less still and boost your
glow which you guys know I love me it's
um glowy skin so my skin is seriously so
soft after using these two products they
both moisturize my skin and smooth it
out and unclog my pores so you can click
the link below if you're interested in
purchasing any of these origins products
they're also available at Origin stores
online and at Sephora and thanks again
to Origins for sponsoring this video
these products are my life I'd also
recommend giving yourself some me time
in the morning and for me personally I
love just sitting down with a cup of
coffee and doing my makeup I'm not
necessarily saying you need to wear
makeup to have a good day like trust me
that is not it but whenever I spend some
time just listening to my music and like
putting on my makeup it's very
therapeutic and I always find I have a
better day whenever I give myself the
time to do this rather than rushing
next I'd have to say to rock your outfit
I know this sounds really superficial
but whenever I wear an outfit that I
feel good in and I feel confident in I
always have so much of a better day
people always ask me why I dress up and
this is honestly it just makes me feel
good and I find I have a better day with
it so whenever I put this jumpsuit on
honestly I feel like a million dollars
so I love it
so definitely find that outfit that you
just feel really good in and wear it
whenever you want to have a good day or
every day it doesn't even matter if
you're anything like me you can get
pretty caught up on social media and
your phone so I definitely recommend
unplugging I find I always have a better
day when I set my phone aside and I'm
actually present in whatever I'm doing
whether that be hanging out with my
boyfriend or my friends are doing work
just you know try to put your phone down
and be in the moment and you'll find
little moments that you experience that
you would have you know been staring at
your phone otherwise this is really
really important to me and it's probably
my number one tip in this video
if you're in need of a little boost I
definitely recommend letting loose and
just turning on your favorite song and
you know jamming out in the car I can't
even tell you guys how often I just jam
out by myself to my favorite music in my
car it's so so important and if you're
having a bad day this is like my number
one tip because it's so so important
just to feel good if you'll energize and
who doesn't love doing this honestly and
lastly I would recommend getting active
and getting a workout in or some yoga I
know a lot of people prefer yoga
especially at night if it's been like a
rough day and you just want to chill you
know go to the park and set out your mat
and stretch and relax and just get a
good stretch in this always feels so so
good physically and mentally and you
might even meet someone you never know
it's a lot of fun just get outside and
enjoy yourself enjoy this video and
you've got something out of it that's
always the goal of my videos and
honestly these are just the things that
make me happy and that make me have a
better day so I hope you guys do the
same as always you guys should also go
