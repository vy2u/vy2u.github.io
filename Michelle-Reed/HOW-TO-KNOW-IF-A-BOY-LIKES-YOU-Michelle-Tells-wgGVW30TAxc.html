you guys because honestly I haven't just
chatted to you guys for a while and so
today I'm sitting down and we're talking
I always ask for questions on my
Instagram so you should definitely
follow me on there and I'll be right
here and yeah you can always ask me
questions because I do feature usernames
in this so you might see your name and
it'll be really cool so we have a lot of
questions to answer so we're just going
to go ahead and get into it
Jenny Parks 13 asks how do you deal with
people being better at everything and
what I got to tell you is usually people
are not better at everything that is
literally impossible honestly everyone's
faking it you probably heard the phrase
fake it till you make it so maybe some
people look like they know everything
and they're always better but let me
tell you most people do not so don't let
it get you down you're probably better
at something it's Emma asked do you
think you will live in the States for
the rest of your life or when you move
abroad I probably live here for all my
life but I do want to travel outside of
the States I have never been out of the
United States and I just think that I'd
really like to do that I want to study
abroad in college particularly in Italy
I have always wanted to go there or just
literally anywhere else besides the
United States so yeah I definitely would
travel abroad I don't know if I'd
necessarily live overseas Kage's mean
asks have you ever had braces I did have
braces I had them from the time I was in
seventh grade and then I got them off
like halfway through my freshman year so
I will insert I will insert a little
picture right here that you can check
out I was not the cutest with braces but
who really is cute with braces honestly
Sarah but the SI song that when you hear
it just makes you instantly happier
definitely it's cigarette daydreams bike
aging the elephant if you haven't
listened to this song I will link it
down below click that like literally X
out of this video and go listen to it
because it is such a good song I listen
to it like every morning on the way to
school it just puts me in the best mood
check it out it is awesome
I heart Justin Bieber for ever ask your
favorite quote at the time which I'm
going
find really quick this one's actually my
planner but I love it it says we are
what we repeatedly do excellence then
it's on it act but a habit by Aristotle
which I just think is such a good quote
because I think if you repeatedly do
things the best that you can you're
gonna be better in everything and just a
really good quote to live by so recently
that's definitely been my favorite table
stubble you asked what is your big
spirit and why is that your fear my
biggest fear is probably elevators I
would consider myself a pretty
claustrophobic person I guess I'm not
like diagnosed is claustrophobic but I
hate being in tight spots and getting
stuck on an elevator would be the worst
thing in the world like I couldn't even
imagine so it sound like my biggest fear
I always take the stairs if that is an
option
ah Calais wants to know if I have ever
felt left out by people at school and
definitely in like middle school and
Intermediate School I feel like that was
like the big thing if you were like left
out from a group but but I think as you
get older you kind of accept the fact
that not everyone is going to include
you and for me personally I'm a very
independent person so I don't mind being
alone missus ID I feel like that's weird
if you like to be alone Joyce to be
surrounded by people and talking and
happy but I enjoy being by myself I
don't feel uncomfortable I feel
completely fine yeah I definitely have
whenever I was younger but now I
couldn't just accepted it if someone
leaves me out it's not the end of the
world
Maddie dogs asked how did you know your
boyfriend liked you and how did he asked
you out and so how did I know he likes
me uh we just kind of knew and we told
each other I feel like there's this
thing nowadays where people don't tell
each other that they're into them and I
just think that's absolutely ridiculous
for me personally dating isn't just
something that I take lightly I date
people who I could potentially see
myself marrying which I know might sound
kind of crazy like surely you're in high
school with what's the point then I
don't understand if you're just gonna
date people and then it's not gonna go
anywhere I just think that's absolutely
ridiculous and so I would just
straight-up tell someone if I like them
because if you like someone you deserve
to tell them and you deserve to not
waste time figuring out if they do or
not you know I just I don't see the fun
in that I know something
enjoy that I don't think it's fun but
how did he ask me out he came up to my
door asked me to use a girlfriend he
gave me flowers and it's been two years
so me macoraba
asked to describe the mind said that I
have grown to approach life with whether
it be philosophic or how will you see
the world I can only change my own
attitude I can't change other people's
so I guess not letting other people's
negative energy affect me that's
something that I've really learned
especially in the past couple of years
is just being happy with myself despite
other people what they might think it
means so those are all the questions
that I'm going to be answering in this
video if you did happen ask me questions
thank you I really really appreciate it
