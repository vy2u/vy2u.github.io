that I have wanted to film for such a
long time and I'm just now getting
around to sitting down and making for
you guys basically today I'm coming to
you from my bed because we're chilling
and talking about body confidence and
how to not hate you're bought for a long
time I didn't really think I was
qualified to do this video because I
thought to myself you know mashaallah
you struggled body confidence you
struggle with comparing yourself to
other people so why should I make this
video and I step back and thought
exactly I struggle with it so I feel
like I am qualified to speak on it
because I get what it's like and I get
how hard it is to overcome for this
advice video I'm going to talk about my
opinions and then I'm going to go into
Instagram and see what you guys think
and see your comments and your questions
so if you ever want to be in one of my
advice videos or one my Q&amp;amp;A videos you
should definitely go follow me on
Instagram it's not Michelle Reed and I
post fun stuff on there I post about my
videos and it's just a really great
place to talk with you guys so I feel
like the route of body confidence issues
comes from two places one comparing
yourself to other people and to wanting
to look a certain way to please someone
else comparison is the thief of all joy
and that's the quote from Roosevelt and
I think it's so incredibly true in every
aspect of our lives whether that be with
our bodies or with our talents I think
with our bodies it's so easy to go on
Instagram or Twitter and see these
models and see these really popular
people on social media who have the
so-called perfect body we feel
threatened and we feel wrong about
ourselves wrong the way that we look
it's so easy while social media is such
a good place if anything you guys know
I'm such an advocate for it I think
social media is awesome I just tweeted
out something promoting social media but
at the same time it can be so incredibly
destructive to self worth and self
confidence and to I think the root of
this problem is one that's kind of
disappear but wanting to look a certain
way to please someone else it's easy to
think hey you know guys are attractive
to this I want my body to look like this
or hey I will really want to get a
boyfriend or a girlfriend so I'm gonna
look a certain way to please someone
else and it's easy to find yourself or
than other people I feel like it's 2016
we're kind of more so away from that
thinking in that way and here's what I
think we are so much more than our fun
and we're so much more than what other
people think about us we have so many
talents and qualities and aspects of
ourselves that are so important and so
much more important than our bodies and
is simply neglect looking at the things
that are awesome about yourself it's too
greedy I don't think we're gonna watch
this and be like I'm sure you know it's
easy you can sit there and say all that
stuff but it is so much easier set
that's done and I agree you know when
you go and try on dresses and you think
you're a smaller size than you are and
you get really worked up about it but
the thing is it's just sighs there's
literally a tag on a dress why should
you go get all worked up and bent out of
shape because of a size of a dress
because of the way that you look it's so
insignificant in the grand scheme of
things I can talk for 30 minutes about
self-confidence but honestly it's
something that you have to learn and
yourself I mean some days you just
aren't confident you're to wake up and
see parts of your body that you know
maybe yesterday you didn't really think
we're that bad but today for some reason
they're just gonna bother you and that's
okay some days you just have days like
that you don't have to be confident a
hundred percent of the time no one is
I'm not it's a live your life in a way
where you constantly nag at yourself for
the way that you look you don't deserve
that you deserve so much more than that
I know this sounds ridiculous and I know
some people may say it's cheesy or weird
I don't really care if you're having one
of those days where you just feel really
really bent out of shape and you don't
feel like you're very confident pull out
a piece of paper and write ten things
that you love about yourself whether
that be personal things like I am a
really good speaker I'm really nice to
people I'm a really good dancer maybe
some things like that or hey I really
like my hair
hey I've been toning up my body lately
just anything some days you just need to
tell yourself and give yourself credit
for the things that you're good at maybe
the problem with lack of confidence is
it's so visible to other people when you
start tearing out other people because
you think they look better than you are
you're jealous of them but you don't
want to show that so you're gonna be
insecure and take that out on other
people that's when it becomes a problem
so now I'm going to go into Instagram
and answer some of your guys's more
personal questions just because I can't
really get a feel of what you guys want
to see unless I get it from you guys
directly Cammie cakes asked how do you
think we can change the media's view of
a perfect body we are kind of getting to
a point it's very late in history I
think we should have hit this
mark a long time earlier but RV just
changed the way that their Barbies are
made they have Barbies of all different
body types
I just think personally is so incredibly
cool when I commend them for doing this
I think media just emphasizes what we as
humans personally think and so we have
to change our way of thinking for media
to change its way of thinking savanah
pills asked what do I do if I constantly
make an effort to eat healthy and work
out but my body doesn't look any
different I totally feel you on this
sometimes I will eat healthy for such a
long time and I'll workout and I'll
still look at my body you'd be like why
am I not reaping the rewards for the
work that I'm putting in it's
frustrating for fitness and exercise
it's a process and it's gonna take a
while so if you are trying to see
results which I think it's fine I feel
like working out kind of has a negative
connotation let go you're trying to
change your body
no you're just owning it and wanting to
live a healthier lifestyle that's fine
it does take a while to see results but
in the meantime when you're in that
process just recognize that you're
putting a conscious effort to live a
healthier life so and that in itself is
enough but give it time and in the
meantime don't beat yourself up about
Queen beating asked I struggle a lot
with eating I won't eat and make myself
dizzy for the sole reason that I carry a
trait for obesity in my family I am NOT
fat but I have curves I'm 5 foot 4
inches in a way with 31:35 and feel
terrible about it how can I cope I've
experienced I find that I am the
happiest whenever I eat til I'm full
whenever I don't eat a lot because I'm
restricting myself I find mine so one
crabby and two unsatisfied personally I
just think that's not worth it to look a
certain way you deserve to eat until
you're satisfied until you're full not
overeating or overindulging but eating
to them out where you feel happy because
as much as we want to believe that once
we achieve a certain fitness goal or a
body goal or whatever people say
nowadays you're always going to want to
change something about yourself we're
never going to be completely perfect you
know once you perfect your skin you're
gonna move on to your weight once you
get the shiniest hair gonna move on to
wanting better clothes it's human nature
we always want something more so why not
just accept the fact that you're not
going to be perfect that you're not
gonna have the perfect body and eating
the amount that makes you happy that
makes you full so those are all the
things that I want to say definitely if
you have any comments down below leave
them you have any questions I'll
definitely be answering more in this
video just because body cough
this is hard and I understand I
understand that me sitting here and
telling you guys about it is never going
to be enough it's hard and it's a hard
issue to tackle but honestly at the end
of the day you're more than your body
and you should love it you're not meant
to look a certain way you're fearfully
and wonderfully made despite what others
may speak about your despite the way
that you may compare yourself to other
people if you guys are gonna go watch my
last video it was a chitchat get ready
with me and I really pop dated you guys
on my wife so you should definitely
check that out and I'll see you guys my
next video
