requested video and it's going to be all
about my study tips and how I maintain
good grades on my nightly routine I
showed you guys kind of how I did my
homework and a ton of people were like
Michelle we need help studying you look
like you have your life together like
give us some tips so today that is what
I'm doing and then one of these videos a
long time ago and it got really good
feedback but this one's gonna be a
little more in-depth of actually like
how to study rather than more like
general things if this video hopes you
would all make sure to give you the like
what make sure to give it a like and let
me know on Twitter and Instagram what
you did and how it helped and all that
good stuff I want to make a super quick
note to say that studying is kind of
personal it's not something that kind of
works for everybody you could have to
find like what works for you so some of
these things don't work for you then
that's totally okay I understand I'm
just kind of showing you guys what works
for me and let's just go ahead and get
started
tip number one is to make a schedule
what you have at the beginning of the
week or like during school of what you
need to do I think it's good to have
everything organized and planned out
whether in a planner or on like a little
calendar in your room just no doubt that
you have to do this this day you can't
procrastinate it and then cross it off
whenever you're done even if like color
code does that make it super cute that
way you're more likely to check it more
often because it's just visually
appealing but this is good to keep a
plan and a routine because people are
more likely to follow a routine then
just kind of go about and do homework
whatever they think they need
number two is whenever you're studying
make sure to find a good quiet
atmosphere where you are free from
distractions so Twitter and Instagram or
your laptop likes to distract you put
those things away as far as possible so
you can't use them unless you need to
use your laptop or whatever just about
all those things away because I
guarantee you'll be more likely to stay
on task with what you have to do ten or
three would be to rewrite your notes
when you get home because I know in
class sometimes your teacher can be
talking really fast and you're writing
and it's super unorganized and you can't
really find like what you're looking for
if you go back to your notes so if I
have notes like that I will go home
I will rewrite them because a writing
something down multiple times helps you
remember it better or at least for me
because I'm a very visual learner and B
it's gonna be a lot more organized so
let's say you have to go back to this
unit because you have a test on it you
can just quit go through like the
highlighted things and just be a lot
more organized because I figured out
that trying to like color code your
notes in class and be organized with
them is really hard and if I focused on
like making sure everything's organized
I will miss important things so I rather
just write everything down and then
organize it later because you know what
hope tip number four is to use
flashcards and what I would recommend is
whenever you get a unit of information
instead of waiting til the night before
the test to make flashcards start making
them when you get the notes because this
will save you a lot of time and it also
be better because you'll refresh your
memory right after you learn the
material so you're more likely to retain
it better tip number five is to say the
hardest work for the beginning of your
study time and the end of your study
time actually look this one up and it's
been like scientifically proven that
it's better to do the harder work in the
beginning in the end because that's when
you're the strongest then I don't really
understand the end because I know I'm
like super drained by the time I'm done
studying so apparently number six is
probably my favorite tip and it is to
reward yourself so let's say you have a
ton of homework to do you have a lot of
math worksheets be like a shell if I
finish this book work I will give myself
a piece of chocolate or I'll let myself
online shop that way you have something
to look forward to at the end of your
studying and it's not super like boring
because you know you got a life at the
end of the time number seven is also a
personal favorite of mine it is to find
online quizzes and tests of the material
that you're studying I think this a lot
for us history I could go on line of you
like chapter twenty-eight of my book and
I would look up like quizlets that had
information and then I'd quiz myself by
assisting yourself immediately after you
learned that in four
it's kind of just a quick check like do
I cap it is do I knock out this joint
you can study some more sometimes some
of the questions on the quiz let's we're
actually on my quizzes so just like
memory it would be whenever you're
studying don't just read the information
to yourself and like pretend that your
minds gonna absorb it because it's not
after you read a chunk of notes or
something trialing for citing them in
your head or saying them out loud if
you're more auditory reciting
information in your head and not wild
it's just the better kind of check if
you got it or not because if you're
chilling on your bed just reading
information you can pretend that you
have it but you really don't
number nine is for my auditory learners
out there try making up some little
rhymes for stuff or some little acronyms
and this will help you remember stuff or
just try things up out loud I think that
saying stuff out loud would really help
some of you guys out so my tenth tip and
the last tip that I have for you guys is
to try summarizing summarizing is such a
good skill to have because I know
sometimes I will read like a huge page
of stuff it'll be like oh my gosh I have
no idea what I just read so to keep
yourself accountable just try to
remember the main facts and at the end
of your reading
maybe summarize it in a couple sentences
or a few sentences okay so that's the
end of this short little study tips
video I really hope to help you guys
with any finals that you have coming up
the exams all that terrible stuff yeah
this video like if you need some help on
studying and you think this video might
have you I love you guys so much
and I hope you all make aids on all your
tests and be phenomenal studiers because
such a good seal out I'll see you guys
at next video bye
smoking cigarettes they be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
