back-to-school Tryon clothing haul
because it is the time of back to school
videos whether you like it or not and so
I purchased a few things while in Ohio
that I wanted to show you guys yes if
you guys would like to see a haul on my
blog channel which is Michelle out of
your show if you're wondering you should
definitely go follow me I love that
channel and I love logging I also didn't
let you guys know that I opened up a
snapchat for you to which I didn't
really want to do for a while but then I
decided that I would know ahead and to
do it for you guys because I think it's
fun user name is Michelle read whitey if
you're interested so you should help me
check that out and also if you're new
and you just stumbled across this video
watching other back to school videos you
should definitely subscribe I upload
twice a week and my name is Michelle
Reid and I definitely love for you guys
to be here watch my videos that's pretty
much all of these self promos that I
wanted to give in this intro so let's
just go ahead and get into the haul
video so the first things I purchased is
from Anthropologie and they were having
a sale so I checked it out and I
purchased this little dress it's just
this white kind of cream-colored
fit-and-flare dress and I think is
really pretty and comfortable and a kind
of person that would much rather wear
dresses than pants and so I love just
having a ton of these comfy dresses to
wear and then I ordered a couple of
things from brandy melville the first
one is just this black crop sweater very
very simple but something that I can
just throw on with some high-waisted
jeans and maybe a cute denim jacket and
I'd have a really nice outfit to wear so
I love Brady Melville all their stuff is
so so comfortable I also purchased this
shirt which is a really really pretty
like light blue color I love this color
and it's just a cropped fitted little
turtleneck tee which again I thought
would be really cute with like
high-waisted black jeans and some black
boots here in the fall time just a
really good essential brandy Melville's
awesome four essentials I don't even
think I mentioned this to you guys but
I'm not going to like high school I'm
actually going to college and I'm moving
to New York and the school that I'm
going to there's actually dress code
which I know a lot of you guys is going
to think it's super duper weird which
yeah first is going to be weird to me
but my school was in the financial
district of New York and so they want
you just to kind of blend in with the
business people and look professional
and personally I just like that it has a
business casual casual or casual dress
code and
so I needed just some more pants I got
this pair from American Apparel it's
just like a polyester high waisted
orange pair of pants I don't own a lot
of orange stuff but I think this is a
really pretty color and really really
perfect for fall and there's so many
different ways I can style this so I'm
really excited for these people that's
all right I got another pair of pants
and I'm going to show this pair to you
guys in a video but they're just these
striped linen pair of pants that are
high waisted and cuff at the bottom I'm
not gonna lie though these are kind of
harder to style just something about the
ribbon at the top it's really hard to
tuck things in too so I don't think
they're the most ideal pants I only have
a couple of shirts I can wear with them
but they are cute and still happy I got
them this next thing is a skirt and I
bought this from a thrift store called
Buffalo exchange if you've never heard
of it it's an awesome awesome thrift
store and they sell kind of higher-end
their store items and so I really really
like it and I purchased this I wasted
denim skirt which kind of has a cool cut
being the Frog different but simpler
because again instead of wearing pants I
love skirts and dresses and I've already
worn this a ton I really really like the
skirt the brand is Lucy Paris if you're
wondering from Urban Outfitters I
purchased this skirt online it was in
the sales section and it has stripes on
it and it has little pockets and it's
just a mini skirt when I say mini skirt
I mean mini skirt this thing's shrunk a
lot in the wash honestly not to be able
to wear this to class or anything but I
think just for like a casual day might
work but just know I didn't intend on it
being this short it just shrunk a lot so
also remembering Outfitters in the sales
section I purchased this dress which is
so cute I love it it's just striped and
it has a little pocket and it flares out
on the bottom but I love the little I
don't know what this is called but has
this black kind of fluttery outline on
the sleeves and the hemline and I just
think it's so cute and fun and girly and
I wear this with high-top converse in
Ohio and I just thought it was such a
cute outfit and so comfortable I love
comfy dresses I'm so happy I bought this
at j.crew I got this skirt for class
it's just a standard cream color pencil
skirt very very simple but then in the
back it has a
we'll cut here I think this is so nice
and I can already tell it to be
something that I wear ton because it
just fits me really really nicely super
classy I want to express to get a couple
of pair of pants this first pair is so
cute it's this really nice just kind of
beige you plaid color and it just kind
of cuts off the bottom very simple these
are the editors style if you're
interested I also got the same pair and
just a black color so just a very simple
black pair of slacks very plain and
simple but I know I'm going to have to
wear a ton of these pants for class and
so I figured I just go ahead and pick up
a couple and then place an order on a
sauce or ASOS I don't know if I'm saying
that right
I don't normally shop there but they had
a couple pairs of cute pants and so I
got this Parrish is just gray and
polyester which usually I don't like but
I think in pants it's fine it's very
loose and comfortable for a day where
I'm not feeling like wearing something
super tight I saw this pair which are
probably my favorites they're just your
standard like black I wasted pair of
slacks very very very simple they don't
have a lot of pockets but I just like
them I think they're comfortable and
they fit really well and they're just a
good pair staff made well was
having such a great sale and that store
was so expensive but I loved it and so I
picked up three things from there that I
love the first thing is just this
t-shirt that says manana which is
Spanish for tomorrow I believe it's just
kind of cropped very very simple just
something that I could throw on under
like a denim jacket with some jeans and
it was only like 20 bucks so and then
got this dress which is probably my
favorite thing I bought in this whole
haul video I just think it's so cute
it's a cream color and it has a collar
knit buttons down very very simple I
like that it's pretty long so it is
something I could wear to class and it
was just so cute with like some brown
wedges so pretty and I'd always add this
in the store and it finally went on sale
and so I decided to purchase it lastly
it made well I just got this little
cardigan that is striped and it has
little tassels on the phone at home I
think it's so so so cute with like just
a plain black shirt underneath and some
jeans and little booties this is going
to be perfect for the fall time cute and
something that I haven't seen a lot
so I'm moving to New York City from
Texas as you know so I do not own any
winter jackets because I'm not used to
the cold great for me but I bought two
big winter jackets from Eddie Bauer we
went to their outlet mall and everything
was so cheap so I just went ahead and
bought these two things the first one is
just your standard khaki rain jacket
because it rains a lot more New York
than here in Texas and so it's really
long and just has great coverage also
has a hood because it's very very
necessary and then I bought my winter
coat which I love it's just like your
standard parka huge jacket the exposure
is really high right now I'm really
really sorry but very simple it's black
and it has kind of like that quilting on
the inside and so this is going to be
super warm and just great for the
summertime summertime for the wintertime
I'm so sorry
and then lastly I have a couple pairs of
shoes to show you guys they're both
tennis shoes because in New York I'm
going to be walking a ton and so I
wanted some comfy shoes the first pair
I'm really really excited about they're
just all white high-top converse and
they don't have like the red lining or
anything there's completely all white
really really excited for these I
haven't ever owned a pair of high-tops I
wanted to wait so I really like to pair
and so I saw these in Ohio and the
outlet I just thought they're really
cute and I went ahead and purchased that
I already showed you guys on video but
figured I would show them again these
are just cold on little sneakers and
they almost look like little oxford
tennis shoes they're so cute and for
someone who is more like girly and stuff
as myself I think these were great
because they're like cute sneakers very
very excited to wear these on the
streets of you so that is everything
that I have to show you guys I hope this
kind of gave you guys some inspiration
of what's out there for back-to-school
