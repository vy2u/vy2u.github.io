overlooked hi guys welcome back to my
channel my name is Michelle Reed and if
you're new you shouldn't subscribe I
upload two times a week but today I'm
going to be doing my back to school
supply as well for 2016 because I
basically do one of these every year
although I'm going to college
I still want to do them I think they're
really fun the thing is as you'll
probably know by now I'm moving to New
York for college and so I'm not buying
my supplies here in Texas I'm going to
buy them whenever I move there and so I
still wanted to do this and show you
guys what I would typically get I
decided to buy these supplies for you
guys and so basically this is going to
be a giveaway if you're interested in
the giveaway make sure to stay tuned
till the end but until then I'm gonna
show you guys everything that you can
win and what I would typically buy for
school so first things first I always
love having binders for school and so I
bought these two which are so so cool
because they're almost like a soft
material and the pattern is just so so
cute these are about 1 inch wide but
they're just like super casual binders
and then I got this one which has a
little bit more color in it but it's
super pretty I wish you guys could feel
these they're so so soft but yeah these
are both one-inch binders and then for
those binders I actually picked up these
dividers which are mark oh they look so
so cool I saw these in Target and I was
like I must get these because I know
marble is such a trend right now but I
absolutely love these dividers and I
think that they're super super cute
there's five dividers in here so you
should have enough to cover a few of
your classes this is kind of random but
I've always wanted to buy one of these
adult coloring books and so I picked up
one for you guys it just has a ton of
different like patterns in it and so you
can use your colored pencils and maybe
if you have like some free time and you
want to get some stress out I've always
wanted to buy one of these but I never
have time to color it so I figured I'd
buy some for you guys so hopefully you
have time for this too I picked up this
pencil pouch which is really really cute
it's just a super cool kind of like
watercolor pattern I thought the pastel
colors are really pretty and so he says
or never this cue and I would buy
supplies and so guys it's 2016 what a
time to be alive
seems kind of boring but everyone needs
is it's just some college-ruled paper
because I know I would always run out of
this
school and so it's super handy to have
so I just picked up a big pack for you
guys also the five-star brand which I
personally love the best because it has
the reinforcements on the side so the
paper doesn't come out of your binders
and stuff I also purchased three folders
this one is just a really pretty light
blue color this one is a really pretty
like yellow sunshine color I love this
color I think so make me so happy if I
were to use this in school and then I
also picked up this blue color to you
and then I picked up two of these five
star notebooks these are just the one
subject ones and these are always my
favorite I'm definitely gonna buy these
for college but they're just very simple
you know five star notebooks these ones
are always the best for me though they
really held together nicely so I just
purchased two of these I purchased this
planner which i think is so cute it's a
really pretty mint green color and it
has a goal of 2016-2017 sign on it but
it just has all of your weeks and then
your months on the typical stuff that is
in a planner just ah this is really
simple and guys planners now or like
sixty dollars and I just I refuse to
spend that much on a planner I just
think that's absolutely ridiculous and
so this is just a cute small one that
honestly does the job but it's still
pretty and aesthetically pleasing for
pens and stuff first I just have these
felt tip pens from paper me guys let me
know if you love these too I would
always use these in school and they
definitely make me write better for some
reason but they're like marker pens but
I just think they're really really
awesome and this one has some really
pretty colors I thought you guys would
enjoy this pack as I just got some very
simple Crayola colored pencils 24 pack
because I would always need these but I
would never have them and teachers would
have like collected bins but they would
all be so bad so I thought you guys your
own pack and I just got a three pack of
highlighters the Sharpie ones were
always my favorite because they have
this smear guard on them which is great
and so just picked up a pack of these
and then my favorite mechanical pencils
which are just these Paper Mate ones
these are so expensive but they were
definitely my favorites and I would
always leave it seasoned so figured you
guys would like them too but I just
picked up a pack for you guys then just
some post-it notes because I would
always run out of these and I think
really handy just for memorizing stuff
and remembering stuff and so this just
has three different colors and it's a
really cute cube and I'm pretty sure
this is the last thing that I got for
you guys but these are just the washi
tapes aren't scotch I just got three
patterns for you guys because I always
see DIY videos with these but who
actually cause washi tape I never have
it so I thought if you guys are wanting
to do some cute DIY stuff with your
supplies these would be handy I just got
the cutest patterns I can find and let
me know how it works so those are all
the supplies that I got now for the
