clothing haul because I have recently
accumulated some things that I wanted to
show you guys in the past few months
there's not really like a theme to this
haul I kind of just bought things to
update my wardrobe I'm trying to buy
more sophisticated pieces and classy
pieces and just kind of change up my
look and so I bought a few staple pieces
that I wanted to show you guys this
isn't a try on haul just because I'm
doing a lookbook next week which I'm
really excited about I'm actually gonna
film it after this one and I want to
save the pieces and I don't want to
spoil anything until then so I'm just
going to show you guys the pieces where
they're from how much they wore and all
that good stuff of course if you're new
to my channel you should subscribe I
upload every Sunday and an occasional
Thursday so if you'd like to check out
my videos you should definitely
subscribe and also be down below with
all that stuff being said we're just
gonna go ahead and get into the video
we're gonna start with Urban Outfitters
because I have the most stuff from there
and I love urban so first I bought this
shirt which says Cooper do I was a
French three years don't know how to
pronounce it but it means lost heart and
it has a heart the middle it's just a
simple t-shirt and I love to use these
simple t-shirts for layering I think
they're really cute under a jacket or
cardigan and I just thought it'd be a
nice little touch whenever I'm feeling
kind of lazy I also purchased this
t-shirt it's just a light purple color
and it's very very simple very soft I
love soft shirts like this and again
great for layering great for under a
jacket or a cardigan and these are the
things I end up wearing the most I know
I'm gonna get a lot of use out of it I
ordered this shirt from online it's kind
of a cropped denim shirt so it goes down
and it kind of a sharkbite cut and it
has a pocket unfortunately this is a
little too big for me of course any
order stuff online you kind of always
have to guess your size and I should've
got an extra small this is just too big
I'll probably just give it to my sister
or someone but I'm really sad cuz it's
really cute and it's a good staple piece
with black jeans and tennis shoes and
this dress so just probably my favorite
thing that I got from urban and it's
definitely more springy I can't wear it
yet but it is a really pretty floral
color and it goes into a high-low
at the bottom it's a really like flirty
and cute dress
and I love the length it's a perfect
length it's just very flattering it has
cap sleeves and a really pretty
sweetheart neckline and I just love this
and it's so cute and I can't wait til
spring rolls around I can wear this I
also ordered a pair of shoes these are
just kind of a canvas color pair of
tennis shoes these are great for making
something more casual or kind of
dressing down and outfit and they're
also super comfy when you're walking a
lot so these are like $15 and I was like
you know what why not so I bought them
really cute for brandy melville is a
very simple leather jacket with faux
leather but it's so so cute and it has
kind of a mesh or not a mesh but it's
kind of puffy on these shoulders and
down it has some zippers I've always
wanted a leather jacket and this one was
around $60 so figure that was a
reasonable price and I love it it fits
me like a glove it's just such a nice
addition to an outfit it makes every
outfit just looks so much more edgy
everybody I would buy a leather jacket
but I've stoked for this from H&amp;amp;M I
bought a few things I bought this peplum
top which the colors are beautiful it's
like a cobalt blue and white and black
and it just flares out and it also has a
slightly open back which is fun this is
such a flattering shirt I'm trying to
buy clothes that aren't as loose and
baggy that actually like look good on my
form and so this one's perfect
and it's gonna be great with some duties
that's office pyram overalls which is my
favorite thing I got there just olive
green and they go down and on the hips
there's really cute pockets or zipper
pockets and then it just goes down to a
long pair overalls these are so cute
I've never owned overalls and I'm so
beyond stoked to show you guys how I
style these next week and definitely
stay tuned because these are cute and
they are gonna be even cuter and look
super popular right now and they look
great to add with a simple top because
they add so much and they're just such a
great statement and I think that
everyone needs one of these
and this is only $15 I don't like to
spend a whole lot of money on jewelry
unless it's a watch because I usually
end up losing it or breaking it or
something so I love this also from H&amp;amp;M I
got a pair of high-waisted jeans these
are kind of almost like a smoke color
but they're high-waisted and then they
fade out right here and then they just
go down they're skinny very flattering I
can never find jeans that actually look
good on me and so these looked really
nice and are great to wear with some
shirts that are cropped I also got two
pairs of gap jeans these are the skinny
ones so they're not jeggings ervice
normal jeans but I've got a black pair
and then I also got a true blue color
because I used to always wear American
Eagle jeans but I noticed I got the best
quality I've been trying out gap there
all right I still haven't found like the
perfect pair of jeans so let me know
where you guys like to get jeans because
I'm so interested from choice I got a
jacket a lot of you guys were asking
where I got this on my Instagram she
should pull me up chérif self promo but
it's just this navy blue jacket that
cinches in and then the sleeves are kind
of arrow II I don't even know they're
kind of striped there was neither jacket
like this and then the back also has
that same pattern and has I really cute
fur hood and I love this it's so so warm
just really flattering to guys it
cinches in and I love it it's just the
perfect coat fits me perfectly I also
went to the fossil outlet store and I've
been wanting a new wallet so I got this
one it's a wristlet and it has black
white and brown I love when they have
all the colors on it so you can wear the
black pairs of wrappers and white purse
and it matches everything so really
really like this it was like $35 because
it was half off since it was on an
outlet so love it and lastly a lot of
you guys are asking me where I got my
glasses from my last video and so
they're from the brand vogue I will try
to find the style number but they look
like this they're just I don't know what
shape this is but I really like them I
think they're more flattering for my
face and I really enjoy them they're
kind of tortoiseshell very very cute and
pretty
so that's everything that I have to show
you guys I really hope you guys enjoyed
this haul video I loved sitting down and
just showing you guys when I bought it's
like coming home and showing your
friends when you go and it's super fun
so I got the joy you should definitely
watch my last video it was all about
relationship goals and just kind of this
warped sense of mine we have developed
about them so I will see you guys my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
