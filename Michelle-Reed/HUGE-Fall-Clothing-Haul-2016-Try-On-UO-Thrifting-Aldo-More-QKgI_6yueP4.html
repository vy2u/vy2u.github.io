doing a fall fashion clothing Tryon home
in this video I'm not only just gonna
show you guys what I've purchased but
I'm also going to give you guys some
tips for shopping I get a lot of
questions especially on my Instagram
just asking like how to shop and what
pieces to buy and kind of just how to
build a wardrobe and so in this video
I'm also going to be giving you guys
tips I also have a lot of stuff because
I've been in New York City for a month
and the shopping here is so good if
you're new like always definitely
subscribe the buttons right here I
uploaded once a week and I also upload
more on my blowin channel which is
Michelle out of her shell you want to
check that out I also want to say that I
know this background is not the cutest
I'm still in my dorm and I can't really
figure out a good filming location this
is the only one that has good lighting
so I promise I will fix it you can
definitely see goldfish over there yeah
really classy we'll just go ahead and
get to the whole video so I'm gonna
start off with the thrift stores that
I've been going to the first third store
that I really enjoyed going to is how C
works they have a lot of different
locations in the city but I always find
such great stuff there first thing that
I have to show you guys is a turtleneck
because hey I love turtlenecks this one
is gray and it is a sweater and it just
has your casual turtleneck and then it
goes into a nice sweater at the bottom
it's SuperDuper simple but I just think
that these are so flattering they're so
great people call these a trend but I
think turtlenecks are always in I love
them that space is also a turtleneck
I've already showed you guys this in a
video but it is my mustard-yellow
turtleneck you guys always ask me where
this is from this is from Housing Works
it's definitely very boxy so it's not
very flattering but the color is
beautiful
I think erotics are really really great
staples for the fall time because you
can pair them with so many different
things but you look very sophisticated
so I'd really recommend picking a few of
those up for your fall wardrobe also
purchase this one which is more like a
sweater hoody kind of thing will
I'm a hoodie but it has a mock
turtleneck so it's a little bit smaller
and then it just goes down into a very
flowy this is definitely more
comfortable this isn't something that
like I'm buying to look like fashionable
or anything else about another sweater
this one is very very plain but it just
kind of goes down and it's a little bit
definitely I want to load up under
sweaters for the fall time because
they're so great to put with scarves and
skinny jeans and boots and under jackets
and there's so many different ways to
style them so definitely recommend
getting some of them I also got this
sweater dress which is just very plain
black and very straight I love how
straight this is I think that is so so
flattering on with some tights and it
definitely goes well with an all-black
look I would so wear it with my scarf
that I have on today or my necktie I
think that this would look so good
purchase this skirt which is definitely
more of a fun piece I always like to
throw in a few fun textures or colors
after this one I love the velvet it's
just a velvet brown skirt which I think
it's bull goes great with a pair of
tights and boots take off this dress
which is just black and it has kind of
like a floral pattern on it and again I
just thought this with tights and boots
and a jacket that I'll show you guys
later with you very very cute also
something good to wear to class because
I have a business casual dress codes
about that would be good so the next few
pieces that I have are from relational
vintage I believe I'll correct myself
I'm wrong but it is another for vintage
trick shot that is in Greenwich Village
and I love this I went with my friend
Rhodes and oh my goodness guys I felt
loved I had so many good pieces first
thing that I got is a denim jacket that
if you know me you know I have worn this
so many times in the past month but it's
just a very long denim jacket kind of
looks like a utility jacket and then on
the top it has a really nice corduroy
detailing and then it also has it here
on the cuffs of the sleeves I just think
this is great if you're feeling more
grungy and you're feeling like just
throwing it over some black jeans and
boots and I think you have a whole
entire look and even with a dress and
like
I just think so great and it was $10 so
I also got another denim jacket this one
is a little bit more basic it's just a
very true denim color and then it just
kind of hits a little bit shorter it's a
little cropped but definitely oversized
I just thought this would be good for
layering especially in the fall time so
that's another tip I would recommend is
definitely picking up some denim jackets
I think they're so easy just to throw on
over things this next thing is not gonna
be everyone's cup of tea I definitely
know there's a green velvet long skirt
and again I love having pieces like
these just to kind of like throw people
off and be like keep them guessing yeah
so fun it fit me perfectly so I just
decided that it was meant to be and I
purchased this and I'm really excited to
style this piece in a lookbook it's
gonna be so good I then stopped by urban
and I first got the little tie that I'm
wearing today I know it's different
definitely adds a little bit of kick to
any outfit I really really like it i
also got this sweater and it's a very
very pretty teal green color and it's
very oversized and long if you like you
could almost wear this tight it's
definitely a favor for wardrobe i'd
recommend throwing it some color when
you're shopping so if you see something
that you're just attracted to the color
wise definitely incorporating because i
think it can be really fun i also
purchased this little cardigan drape
thing it's really wrinkly i need to wash
it but it's a really pretty oatmeal
color and the sleeves kind of flare out
and it's kind of just bunches at the
bottom but i thought this was really
comfy just to throw on i would
definitely wear it with why i'm wearing
today
and then this purchase was kind of my
guilty pleasure purchase I've been
wanting one of these teddy bear coats or
so long so I just decided you know what
we're getting one it's literally just
like a fuzzy blanket coat and it's
two-tone very neutral very cute not
super fashionable pretty tacky but for
one of those days where it's freezing in
New York City and I don't want to put on
an actual jacket I just want to bundle
up this will do the job from Uniqlo I
bought this turtle
tank top which I thought would be great
under a jacket if it is a little bit
warmer and I don't want to wear long
sleeves just a cream nice turtleneck
sweater even though it is full I'd
recommend incorporating a few like tank
top pieces just cuz you never know what
the weather's gonna be like and then
this skirt is so pretty and it makes me
so happy it's the most beautiful mauve
color and it goes right at like the
smallest part of your waist and then it
just kind of goes out at the bottom
super flowy and pretty and just dainty
and girly again I love really girly
pieces like this I got this piece when I
was back in Texas but I wanted to show
you guys it's a really pretty mint green
kind of trench coat blazer type thing
really were to describe but I thought
this would be so cute just a layer over
dresses and skirts and on my Instagram a
lot of you guys asked for it was from
it's from 2020 AB which is a really
awesome online store I'll have it linked
down below definitely adds a really
great pop of color and then for fall
shoes I've only picked up one pair but
these are from the brand Aldo and
they're just above the knee boots and
they're black and suede and healed and
they tie up in the back I've been
wanting a nice pair of these boots for a
while so I went ahead and I purchased
them I love these I think over the knee
boots are so so cute and they just
really add like a little bit of flare to
any outfit so I will be styling all
these pieces in a lookbook very very
soon but I did want to kind of just show
you guys what is out there for the fall
season because a lot of times I'll post
my look books and the clothes will
already be gone and so I just wanted to
show you guys ahead of time you should
also go watch my last video which will
be elites right here it was a very very
cute weekend morning routine and then
also on my social medias here because
while I'm in college and I'm busy and
not posting that often I'm always
posting on there I love you guys so much
and I'll see you guys my next video I am</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
