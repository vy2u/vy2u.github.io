exciting video this is my New York City
fashion haul or clothing haul I like
shopping in Soho while in New York and I
have a ton of fun I actually blogged it
if you want to check it out it's over on
my blog channel I'll have it linked
somewhere on the screen but I had so
much fun and I found so many good finds
and so I'm really excited to show them
to you guys it's also a Tryon home
because I basically only do Tryon house
because you can't see what a piece looks
like unless it's on if you're new to my
channel you should definitely subscribe
I upload on Sundays or Thursdays and I
love doing cause I feel like hauls are
one of my better videos on my channels a
lot of you guys seem to like these I
think they're fun you get really really
good fashion advice from it so yeah
really excited to hop on into this video
so let's just go ahead and get started
so first we're gonna start off with toby
calm which is a really awesome online
company i'll have it linked down below
also if you're a first-time user or
customer you get a 50% off code which
also have a link down below that you
should definitely check out but i got
three things here the first thing is
this shirt that is kind of like a
cropped tee and it has the lake set
detailing and it has bell sleeves I
really love this I love the color I love
the lace up detail I had yet to pick up
something with this trend on it so I
think it goes great with like black
high-waisted jeans it's a little more
crops than I usually go but I think for
spring this will be really really nice
to wear and then got this shirt which is
definitely more of a simple shirt but
it's just kind of this maruti purple
color and it drapes down and it kind of
goes longer on the side so I think this
is like a sharkbite Tom I really really
like the color of this I didn't have
anything that's as purpley kind of
maroon color so love this it's great for
just a day whenever you're not feeling
like styling a whole outfit you just
want something more simple this last
thing unfortunately was too big but I
still really liked the piece it's just
this army green jacket it's so hard to
show on camera this from the impossible
but basically just drapes in the front
and then it goes down and then in the
back its inches but I ordered this in a
small for some reason this is really
really big so if you are going to
purchase this piece
I would recommend sizing down like two
sizes because this is a small on it just
really like it's a miss my body it's not
even like to the point where it's just
that kind of grunge oversized it's like
oversized so we're gonna get this just
would recommend sizing down a little bit
when I went to New York I bought a
couple pieces for my presentation for
the scholarship competition I was and I
needed a business casual dress so I just
got this one that has horizontal stripes
and then in the bottom it has a vertical
stripes which is super flattering it
cinches in on the way short sleeve just
very very simple this is from The Loft
it was really really expensive I'm not
gonna lie but I just think something
like this is a staple and I know
whenever I need to wear something that's
a little more conservative this is gonna
be good this next piece I'm so excited
about I got this from j.crew but it's
this dark denim jacket they just put in
this down the front it has pockets it
goes down and I love this I feel like
all denim jackets are a light wash and
so it's nice to have this true denim the
deal on this guys this was a $90 jacket
on clearance for $40 and then I checked
out it was 20 bucks this j.crew jacket
they had one left was $20 so this is
such a steal and it's perfect for spring
whenever it's one of those chilly or
spring days and you just need to throw
on a denim jacket so in New York I
stopped by a store called Uniqlo or
Uniqlo really really cool store they
have very simple pieces but not this
kind of not necessarily olive green but
just kind of a sage green color top it's
just really flowy and plain it's a
really cool material I've never owned
something this material but this is such
a staple under like a black leather
jacket and black jeans and black booties
I think does it just create a really
really nice outfit again for one of
those days where you don't feel like
styling something and I got this very
very simple what is this like a mock
turtleneck top and it's long sleeves and
it kind of flows outwards I like this
because I feel like a lot of women's
tops cinch in at the waist like they
assume everyone has is really small
waist this is just a very straight
structured simple top which I think
looks good on all body types so I really
like this the color is something I know
have very again easy to style a pretty
mellow I first placed an order and I got
a few things I got this plain just olive
green simple top which is great for
throwing a scarf over I think but it's
just tight fitted very flattering
I then got this gray red shirt which is
long sleeves I really like this shade of
gray it's not like but it's not dark
it's just like a good between I wore
this so many times it's so comfortable
and it's just it's the perfect length
it's not cropped but it's not long just
a good like standard shirt I then got
this top which is again like an olive
green color it's just a more flowy and
plain again one of those shirts that you
just throw on day you're not feeling
maybe like a statement necklace and some
skinny jeans you just look very put
together and then this shirt I
absolutely love this probably my
favorite shirt I got from brandy
melville but it's just a kind of pin
striped shirt that buttons down and I
thought it was black it's actually navy
blue this is so cute with high-waisted
jeans because it is a bit crops with
like some heeled booties you just look
like you have your life together it's
like one of those shirts that you're
like yeah she like knows what she's
doing yeah and then the actual brandy
melville store which I want to say if
you guys have ever been to a brandy
Melville store do you ever feel like you
kind of get like a pretentious vibes
when you go in I feel like the people
there just act like they're doing you a
favor by running the store I don't know
I just get really weird vibes and then
whenever I was checking out they asked
if they could take a picture of my
outfit for like a customer page which
was kind of weird I don't really know
what's going on but took it as a
compliment I don't know I got this talk
which is just a really plain white shirt
and it has holes at the bottom and when
this was hanging up they actually had it
tied here on the bottom which I totally
imagine this with like a black leather
jacket black skinny jeans and scipio
buddies and maybe like a chunky necklace
or something I don't know I just thought
very cool like rocker ish phibes but and
then I got one of these tops which
basically looks like a dress short
sleeves and then it goes down pretty far
but as slits in the side so you can't
actually wear this as a dress because it
slits right here so I currently wear
this with again black jeans I feel like
all these outfits of like black jeans
but this I just think is a really cool
piece
it's gonna be really fun to style one
it's a little out there for me but at
the same time it's relaxed at the same
time and then I saw these pants hanging
up and I told myself Michelle you do not
need another pair of sweat pants but
what do you know these are just super
comfy grey like big sweats with stitches
on the ankles the softest sweats I've
ever felt if I could live in a pair of
pants it would be these pants and then
I'm at the top shop which again they
don't have here in Texas but was kind of
disappointed Topshop is really expensive
and I feel like the clothes just don't
measure up to the prices but I had to
get a pair of Jamie jeans because so
many people talked about these and I was
like you know what I'm gonna splurge and
buy these there's black jeans they're
skinny and then they have the rips and
the knees and then they go down these
are really really cute and I feel like
just a staple piece I know everyone has
these right now but they're nice these
jeans are just really really
good-quality and they're really the only
thing at Topshop that I could justify
spending you know like $70 off no no
with the sorrow which is one of my
favourite stories now I love d'asaro I
got the shirt that I'm wearing right now
it's just this floral cropped shirt with
kind of puffier sleeves so pretty for
spring and then in the back it has a
really pretty button feeling so cute so
freeing and just nice to wear and then I
got this piece which is probably my
favorite thing in the hall it's a
mustard yellow kind of faux leather
skirt goes down super simple has a
zipper in the back I love this guy's
it's the perfect length it has pockets
gonna be so cute to style in the spring
like this just screams spring to me I
don't know about you guys and then I got
this shirt which i think is so so pretty
it's just a button-down top that short
sleeves it has pleats and it kind of
flows out I'll insert a picture of me
wearing this I posted it on my Instagram
you guys should definitely follow me at
Michelle read love this so cute with
high-waisted black jeans it's just very
feminine and girly but it's gonna be so
much fun to mix with more like masculine
pieces I love doing that and then I also
got this hat which is actually for my
sister of Jamie but I wanted to show in
this video because I think it's super
cute just a black hat
with these little silver medallions and
like a tribal piece I wore this back on
the plane because I didn't want it to
get crushed in my luggage but I just
loved it i was watching Carly Kristin's
video and she was like if you see
someone wearing a hat you just feel like
they have their life together they can
totally just be having a bad hair day
they put it on a hat and you're like wow
holy they got everything together and
then they got a pair of booties because
I wanted these to wear with the dress
and I just wanted a black pair of
booties so I got these black ones from
Ralph Lauren they just zip they have a
buckle these are at Marshall's for I
think $50 which I thought was a good
price for a stable pair of black booties
and these look like they would really
hurt to break in not at all like so
comfortable I walked around New York for
two days and these didn't give me one
blister so go Ralph Lauren love these
boots so those are all the pieces that I
have to show you guys let me know if you
have gotten any good deals what your
favorite stores are to shop that I'm a
Shopaholic I'd love to know if you
