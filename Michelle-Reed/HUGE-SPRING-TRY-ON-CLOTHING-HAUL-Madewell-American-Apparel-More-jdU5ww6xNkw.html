everyone today I am here to a try on
spring the whole I know it's been a
while since I filmed a video so just
letting you know that I am back I have
not done a try on haul and literally I
think like four months or something and
so I decided to come here and show you
guys some things that I got in New York
City right now it's not necessarily the
warmest but whenever I went back home I
got so excited plus I knew that I was
going on some fun trips this summer if
you're new like always definitely
subscribe button is right here also I
want to let you guys know I have been
super active on my Instagram my Twitter
my snapshot so deadly go fall on my
social medias also my hands are orange
self-tanning fail I know also I know I
cut my hair if you want to watch the
vlog than I did it in it'll be linked
down below it's super different but so
springy in summary a lot of things I'll
just go ahead and get right into the
video so I'm starting off with some
stuff from an online clothing store
called 20/20 AB I love this tub if you
watch my videos you probably know I talk
about them all the time but they sent me
a few things to include in this video
not being paid or anything I just really
like the brand and I can do stuff
awesome I first have got this shirt
which is really really clean it's a
really pretty like sage green color and
then it has built sleeves and it's a
little bit crop but not to prompt
actually wear this to class today I
think it's really cute I hands are not
this orange guys I promise and on this
next thing is so cute I'm pretty sure
I'm going to use this as a beach
cover-up because I just think it is so
so pretty it's like this 70s kind of
Paisley romper the colors are absolutely
beautiful it has really pretty bell
sleeves and then has some little shorts
I just thought this was adorable and
then the back is literally completely
open so I think I'm going to use this as
like a swim cover-up another one thing
that I got are these wrap up sandals
they're kind of hard to show but I've
seen these everywhere and I'm not
usually one for trendy things I just
found these are so so you really really
strappy sandals and I decided to pick up
a pair I think they're really pretty
brown color so the next few things are
from Free People I first have almost got
this dress I think is so so cute right
here on the front it has these little
flowers and then it just goes down until
your really cute baby don't say oh well
then it also
of the flower trim on the bottom I was
actually invited me to go Hawaii with
him this summer and so I totally saw
myself wearing this on the beach I just
thought it was really really really
really cute in the back that completely
exposed I also got this top from three
people this is actually from Nordstrom
Rack so it was a little bit cheaper
it just has a high neck and it has lace
detailing on it and then it kind of goes
into a peplum style I love high neck
things I think they're so dainty and
cute and fun and I thought the colors on
this are also really pretty just with
like some high-waisted denim jeans and
like some chunky heels or something I
thought that'd be really really cute as
I love this dress from a department
store it's the brand as you wish but
it's kind of just a black off the
shoulder dress that's really really cute
it goes to about my knees and I just
think black is like the most flattering
color I really like off the shoulder
tops are really cute if you ever way to
a situate your color bows I think
they're really great I want to fall
Valentine's Day I posted a picture on it
a lot of you guys are wondering where
this is from this is actually routine a
Mac it's just a really cute
borma jumpsuit a legs kind of float out
order so seriously I don't do but I
thought this is really cute just this
definition of spring like when I look at
this I think of spring as a life because
it has the drawstring around the waist
so it just really looks good it brings
everything together
and so another jumpsuit this is from
Anthropologie I don't ever buy things
full price at Anthropologie just goes so
crazy expensive actually office for a
problem fashion show that I went to but
it's just black and it has just normal
straps and then it goes down and it has
these kind of floral patterns on the leg
and the legs flare out just the most
flattering jumpsuit it looks so so good
on might still be on sale at
Anthropologie so if you're interested in
this doubly check it out I think it's a
really really cool find and I'm pretty
sure American Apparel was going on
business or the store was closing or
something and basically everything in
the store was like $15 which was just
really weird to me because American
Apparel is so expensive I got four
thanks here because everything was $15
and then everything was 40% off so all
this does is like 25 bucks which is so
good I first got this dress which
everyone has been asking me where it's
from I've been posting so many pictures
on
Instagram with it but it's just was
really cute ribs gray dress and it has
some button detailing and it goes a
bounce down to my caps and it's just
kind of tight super flattering super
cute just to throw on and run errands
with I also got this top which is just
burnt orange and it's cropped and I
thought this would be cute I definitely
do turn all over this I don't have to be
cute with like a high-waisted skirt or
high-waisted jeans I wouldn't actually
like show my stomach with this because
I'm not really into like crop stuff but
if I was cute for layering and I always
need crop things for high-waisted pants
that I wear this next skirt is adorable
I love it it is the prettiest like
banana yellow color and then it's really
really flowy and it ties in the waist
which I like so you can kind of see like
what size you want it to be only thing
is this is a little bit see-through and
I didn't really realize it I was trying
it on so I need to see you're all like
how to put slip under this or something
because it is see-through and I also got
this skirt which I need to get altered
but it is just a white really cute like
tennis style skirt but it is going to
just look like this I have like some
little splits in the front and it's a
really nice tool in a material which
linen and my absolute favorite for the
summertime preverbal Outfitters I just
stopped by really quick and I just
picked up this t-shirt which was on sale
it's literally just a great t-shirt
really simple nothing - and I honestly
sleep in this because I think it's
really comfortable then I found my
favorite shorts ever
these are little thick shorts and they
just have like green wall I'm pretty
sure or something like that but I
devised cute and it literally feels like
a fleece blanket so they're so
comfortable to sleep in from made well I
got a pair of capris these are just
really light denim capris i think the
distrusting is beautiful on them these
are on sale and they're a little bit
looser and just more relaxed and
comfortable
I actually feature these in a lookbook a
while ago but I really love meetable
jeans they're my absolute favorite under
Nordstrom Rack I found a pair of joe
jeans on sale which Joe jeans are so so
nice so I went ahead and picked them up
it's just a dark wash pair of jeans
really really plain just straight jeans
I can never find jeans that fit me right
because I hit are like pretty narrow I
don't have like very wide tips at all
but my thighs are also a little bit more
month
Keeler's I can never find jeans that fit
with Joe jeans always work so I would
definitely recommend those if you're
looking for some from j.crew Factory I
just have this red pencil skirt because
my college I have our business casual so
I'd also be cute for the springtime or a
nice pop of color I'm not usually a red
person but I think I was like a really
pretty like tomato red also if you
watched my blogs I talked about how I
lost my wallet and so I picked up a new
wallet this one is from fossil I think
it's so cute and literally matches my
jacket
it's like suede but it's also leather so
just really nice great quality wallet I
love this and then I have two pairs of
shoes this first pair of shoes is a
brand Naturalizer so they're so
comfortable but they're just black
booties and they are healed and they're
like half snakeskin almost but half
leathers so they are so cute I
completely wore out my black booties
living here in New York because I walked
on them so much but I just think you
were really cute I warned them like
every day since I've gotten back to the
city I also have the shoes sent to me
but I call it spring I thought I
mentioned that I think they're so fun
there's a secured little pair of heels
and they are pink velvet like so crazy I
don't think I want anything like this
right now so they're really cute and fun
I was doing a Valentine's Day post with
them because everything that I have to
