you're new to my channel you should
subscribe this video is going to be a
huge summer clothing haul because I have
a ton of stuff to show you guys all the
glowing pieces in this video are from
the company princess Polly which is a
really cute little Australia both geek
and they were super sweet designs
themselves to feature in this video and
so I decided to do this all videos today
I don't have a discount code which is
Michelle xx and it gets you 20% off so
you should only use that if you plan on
ordering something everything will be
links down below along with the website
so let's just go ahead and get right
into the whole video so the first thing
is my absolute favorite thing because it
reminds me of the movie lala land
because it's so cute it's just the
prettiest little yellow dress it's like
the perfect summer dress hit about mid
thigh I would say and then the back is
the cutest part it actually ties in the
back I usually tie it in a knot kind of
hard to show right here but you'll see
in the Tryon this is adorable and if you
have like your summer tan going I think
that this looks absolutely so cute I
also know shipping is expensive and so
they have free Express shipping if you
order over $70 to us so it's definitely
very useful I really like this dress
I don't buy a dress in a size 8 but I
would recommend sizing down because I
think the fabric is a little bit too
larger and so I would have rather gotten
to size 6 in it I usually wear an extra
small or small and clothes I know what
you guys have been asking applies
although a lot of you guys been
commenting that my undereyes are super
bright and it's only because I'm filling
in my living room and it's so bright in
here but it looked reflects off of my
eyes and so I promise I'm not wearing
concealer that's like why it just looks
like that next dress is basically the
same style as the olan but it is
actually denim it's a really nice little
cotton dress and it goes about the same
length it's a little bit shorter I think
this dress is so pretty I think the blue
on this is absolutely beautiful and then
again in the back just has the really
cute open back with the tie I would
recommend actually sizing up and this
one it is a little bit tighter and it's
also a little bit shorter so I kind of
wish I would have gotten a size 10 you
go to sing a style for some reason the
fabrics are different here no I love
cute jumpsuit and so I got this one
which the fabric and that's what is
really really nice quality it's
definitely very cottony but it's a
really pretty moss color and it's just
that little strap goes up and then the
legs are like those culotte I am so
saying that we're all kind of flare out
a little bit so they're a little bit
bigger and then the back is my favorite
part because again it has a little time
identify date I think if it's perfectly
can it's still a little bit loose and
breathable for the summertime it does
still flatter your body the best pants
are really really cute they are just
little striped pants you can't see them
right here because it's so bright but
you'll be able to be in the Tryon
they have little stripes in them and
then the legs square out and they also
tie around the waist and I actually got
these for class but they're a little bit
too tight for me to wear to class
because my school is business casual I
feel like it does it a lot but I got
these in a size 6 and I definitely
should have got these in a size 8 or 510
so if you're planning on getting these
I'd recommend sizing up a size or maybe
two sizes because they are a little bit
tight they're meant to be a little bit
looser things are really cute especially
if you're going somewhere more
professional or if you wear it like a
black bodysuit and some cute little
black heels I think I'm going to be
really cute materials also really light
and breathable which is super nice for
the summer time I really really like
these this next thing is a skirt and
this is just a really cute black denim
skirt how by it's very frayed at the
bottom and it also crosses over and it
has like a belt on it is like a wrap
skirt which you guys know I love me a
cute wrap skirt they're so flattering I
think this is such a staple to have the
material of this is so great such a nice
quality definitely something that I can
tell I'm going to be wearing so much
because I love skirts I went to throw
the black bodysuit I'm going to show you
guys in a second I don't know about
skirt and a size six and I think it
could absolutely perfect this is a
really cute little done skirt it is just
denim and it has little flowers on it
I think the Rose is on it or just punch
a nice little detail and brings out the
ball I'm just kind of your average like
a little denim skirt I have this in a
size 6 and I would definitely recommend
sizing up the size about fit but it's
definitely tighter the quality is really
this is just a classic really cute rib
bodysuit that kind of buttons up it's
black and I really like this thing cuz
it's very very flattering these actually
button up I just don't have the funds I
won't actually work I'm like completely
open like that this is so flattering if
you tuck this into some high-waisted
jeans or high-waisted skirt so
comfortable I wore this yesterday and I
was just living it up because it was
perfect for summer because this is a
nice little piece to go on I got this in
a size 8 and I think it fits absolutely
perfectly and then have another skirt
which I think this one is beautiful I
think the colors is this are just lovely
it's a really pretty olive color but
it's a really cute little wrap skirt if
it almost looks very afraid
like it looks tropical it's something
you wear in the jungle or something it's
a very thin material so it's a very
breathable material for summer I have
this note I'm six should have gotten it
in size eight because it is a little bit
tight I were going to sizing up in this
one I think but it's a really cute skirt
it's just a little bit tight on me this
shirt is going to be really interesting
to actually show you guys but I'm going
to try anyways it's just a light blue
shirt this is like Cinderella to me it's
like literally Cinderella in color form
basically you put it on and it has like
wavy sleeves which I think are so cute
but you basically wrap it around your
waist and you tie it I can even show you
guys this you'll see it in the shrine on
I think this is such a flattering shirt
such of your collarbones I think it
makes them look really really nice color
is beautiful
so for summer I think this would be
really cute with like a flowy skirt and
some little sandals a blue shirt I got
it in a size six I think of it perfectly
the last thing I have to show you guys
is this white shirt it is a really
pretty big crochet shirt and sleeves
have really nice lace detailing on them
just ties in the front I think this
would be such a lovely slim cover-up it
is a little bit bigger it just has like
two sizes on the work side but the white
color also makes you look really tan in
the triumf if I just wore this with some
jeans and I think it looks nice I got
this in a size eight to ten and it fits
like it's supposed to it's definitely
oversized but it's it's also suitable so
that was the end of my try on haul I
