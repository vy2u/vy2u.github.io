done a trial clothing haul and pretty
much a really long time I think it's
been since like February
tonight I have a haul for you guys
today's haul is all princess Polly I
seriously love princess Polly so much I
don't think I've ever loved to bring as
much every single thing I get for
princess Polly is always super
flattering it's comfortable and it just
makes me know really confident I'm so
excited for this haul video I love them
use a discount code I have a 20% off
coupon code it's Michelle XO if you want
a 20% off your whole order I'm just
having a really cozy day I'm drinking a
nice cup of coffee we are chilling out
I'm also getting a try on haul because I
know you guys like to see sizes what
things look like I also know it's sizing
with princess Polly sometimes things can
be a little bit different so I'm gonna
give you guys my sizes just so you have
that for reference and it departs for my
coffee and get right into it I'm also
doing a giveaway with them on my
Instagram if you want to follow me and
possibly win a $250 gift card I'm giving
away two the first thing I got is the
top that I'm wearing I love this I know
it's summer but I still really love
wearing kind of comfy loungy clothes I'm
usually cold in my house and so I like
this it has really just thick sleeves
it's really comfy and it's off the
shoulder you can wear it like one
shoulder bow I think these tops are
really flattering to like your
collarbones blown collarbones and your
shoulders and so I personally really
love them I got this in a size 8 let's
say I got is the top I love this shirt I
think it is so pretty I've been eyeing
this on the website forever and I
finally went ahead and ordered it it's a
crop top but if I wear this with
high-waisted shorts pants it looks
really cute it has this really nice lace
trim on it the detailing is beautiful if
you guys know me I love girly outfits I
think they're so cute and I got this top
and a size 8 as well I love the dresses
from princess Polly especially but I got
this one it just has green and white
weaves on it and it ties in the waist I
love a good tie dress this dress is so
pretty it has leaves
it has little like vines on it it is so
so cute I'm a little bit taller and so I
went ahead and got a size 12 in this one
because I've got my buying things that
are too short lately and then I don't
wear them so I don't feel comfortable
about this dress and this one is
probably my favorite thing I got our
second favorite at least I love it it's
this beautiful linen material it's such
a pretty color I love khaki I think it's
beautiful it buttons down and it's a
little low-cut so I definitely need to
pin it but I love the sleeves on it
again it's so girly so cute I also got
this one in a size 8 as well okay real
talk though on this one the most
flattering thing I have ever worn the
dress and it totally looks like sandy
from Greece I think it is adorable
this dress is off the shoulder so again
it really shows off those color bones it
looks so pretty it's black so it's
really flattering it goes about to your
knees and it's quarter length and you
know this is gonna be so cute for a date
night whenever I get back to New York
City for my last year college I'm
totally gonna wear this whenever I go on
a super cute date it just makes me feel
so confident I love when you put
something on and you just feel good you
feel like yourself you feel confident
and to me that's exactly what princess
Polly does I showed this dress on my
Instagram story and you guys really
liked it and I love it too it's so cute
I got that dress in size eight as well
and I also got this one in an 8 but it's
just this little crocheted dress and
it's kind of off the shoulder but it's
really like a tube dress and it ties in
the front and it's lace and crocheted so
cute and this one looks so pretty if you
have a tan it's a little see-through and
so I definitely think this is something
that I'm gonna wear us like a swim cover
Abhiyan boy you'll be able to wear this
I don't know I just think it's really
cute and just dainty and pretty this is
a top I finally know something about is
it not a dress I think that this one is
so cute I got this in a size 8 but I
kind of wish I would have gotten into
six would be tighter but it's another
off the shoulder top it's just black and
then the sleeves on it are really cool
because they actually have slit in them
and so I think that they're really cool
and different but I think this was like
high-waisted jeans and booties and the
fall time is gonna be so cute but yeah
like I said I kind of wanted this to fit
more like a bodysuit it's a little bit
bigger and so I'd recommend sizing down
this top is really really cute as well
again I kind of wish I would have gotten
this in a 6 but I got in an 8 it's just
a long-sleeve bell sleeve top and has a
stripe on it the fall time I know I'm
gonna be crazy by the sweaters when it's
summer but these are things that I
always wish I have whenever I go back to
school and so cute just a light creamy
crochet kind of sweater kind of like the
one I'm wearing but it's off the
shoulder so comfy I love these the
lounge and I think Simmi comfy this
would be so cute with like some
bell-bottom jeans and some boots and
like one of those little train conductor
hats I don't know the name of them I'm
that into all the trends right now I got
this in a size 6 dress is one of my
favorites as well this is definitely one
of my absolute favorite colors it's this
army green color and it buttons down and
then the bottom just kind of has like a
flare bottom the sleeves are cute I love
throwing these kinds of things on with
just some sandals and calling it a day I
think that they're really really cute so
love this materials really awesome it's
a really nice thick material and I got
this in a size 8 this one also might be
one of my favorite things I bought I
think that this is such a truss but it's
just like an off-the-shoulder maxi dress
I love red I've been wearing a lot more
read lately exciting fred is so so
pretty but it's tighter on the top and
then it goes out and it has little slits
and I just think that this is so
beautiful for the summertime super flowy
I got this in a size 8 and it fits
perfectly like I could not have asked it
to fit any other way I got this jumpsuit
and I've been seeing this a lot actually
so I'll just Conte I think with this but
it looks so pretty on her it's just an
off-the-shoulder and polka dot jumpsuit
not this one is size 10 because again
like I said I'm a little bit taller this
dress really cute it has little poppies
on it please don't be the person who
goes down below and says you said cute
56 times like I feel like we know a kind
of person that is in real life I know I
say cute a lot really adorable super
summery I think this is an awesome
little flair dress and I got this one in
a size medium size pants not these pants
which unfortunately don't fit me I think
I overestimated how much I've been
working out lately about these in this
size 8 so I'd recommend sizing up in
these ones I also have more muscular
thighs because I run a lot there are
these high-waisted black pants with
these little bell bottoms on the bottom
and I thought these would be really cute
for class but unfortunately I can't even
sit them up they're too tight so so I
thought if you want these but I do think
that they're still for accessories I got
a few things I really wanted to be
trendy and get one of these hats that
everyone's wearing and y'all look how
cute this hat is unfortunately I got
this in a size small and my head is too
big for it
like I can't get this to go on and if I
do oh my gosh it hurts too bad so this
is the closest we're getting I'm not
gonna go out looking like this I would
recommend probably slicing up in this
hat I don't think my head's huge baby it
is think I should have gotten the medium
but it is really cute I also got this
belt because I just don't have enough
belts to wear it's just a black a simple
belt design but I just need belts I'd
love to be cute with high-waisted jeans
I got this scarf it's just like a gold
almost olive colored scarf that I think
is really beautiful I actually wanted
this for my hair I thought this would be
so pretty in a ponytail tied up I love
how Kristin John's always Styles her
scarfs in her hair and so I thought this
one would be really cute for that
I love platform shoes I think they're so
comfortable and flattering so I got this
black pair that are really adorable I
would actually recommend sizing down and
these funds
I went sized down and there's still a
little bit big so maybe you'd size down
to sizes or like size and a half you're
really cute I'm still gonna wear them
even though they're a little big but so
that is my haul from everything I got
from princess Polly if you guys enjoyed
