haul video over the past like a few
trips I've gone and done some shopping I
consider this huge this is a lot of
stuff for me I know it's done a lot of
stuff for other people but for me this
is huge so that's why it's in a title I
don't really want to do a long intro so
I think I'm just gonna go ahead and get
into this first I went to San Antonio
for dance competition and we did some
shopping while we were there so the
first store I went to was papaya which
I've never been a big fan of but I went
in there and I saw some really keep
stuff so the first thing I bought is
this peplum top it's just a black peplum
top it looks like that but in the back
it has this really cute like tois tan
and black go in the back that flows down
I think it's so pretty very flattering
shirt and it's very cute this one sale
for twelve dollars so I figured I'd go
ahead and buy it also about this awesome
pair of kind of fake leather shorts
they're high-waisted so they hold
everything in but they're so cool I
think they're so cute and they have
pockets which is awesome and I really
really like these these are on sale for
like twenty two dollars like I've always
wanted a pair of these I went ahead and
bought its but I really really like
these I think they're so cute so I also
needed a pair of swim bottom so I want
to target and i got these ones they're
very cool just tribal pattern make green
red and orange ones if they're so cute i
love target swimsuits because they're so
comfy and they're so cheap and so I
picked these up and I think they were
like eighteen dollars or maybe either
the brand Massimo but we also went to
the outlet malls in san marcos and went
to the pac sun and i got this shirt it's
just a very soft t kind of when you're
feeling lazy shirt and then the back
it's all floral and super pretty and
then it also has a floral pocket on it
and I thought this was very very cute it
was so comfy and when I wear this to
school I got so many compliments so many
people rolling shell I love your shirt
and I was like thank you tears were
flowing but I absolutely love this shirt
it's very comfy and it was on sale for
like fifteen dollars so
couldn't pass it up we also add to the
victoria secret which let me just say it
was amazing if we had more time I would
have bought everything in that store but
we only have like 15 minutes so I got a
couple things the first thing is the
swimsuit and this is one sale for
fifteen dollars as well and I could not
pass it up it's just a super cute floral
design swimsuit with a little circle
thing in the middle and it's a halter
top and it just ties in the back I think
it's really cute the insides hot pink
and i love victoria secret swimsuits and
they're usually like fifty dollars so i
figured you know fighting one for
fifteen dollars is amazing so I also got
this sweater from victoria secret it's
just a really cute mint green hoodie
listen starts on the bottom it's very
soft and comfy and I love stuff like
this just a lounge in with some leggings
and it was originally like fifty dollars
when i got it for 20 so i thought that
was pretty awesome and i absolutely love
it and I've already warned it a lot and
it's super comfy and I'm going to wear
it after this video because I love it we
also it to the polo outlet and I wanted
some polo t-shirt so I got these men's
ones and the first one is just a gray
one and I absolutely love it super cute
super comfy just to wear when I want to
wear something kind of chill I also got
this really really pretty kind of
sky-blue color one looks like that these
were two for 20 which is that was a
great deal I've always wanted some polo
shirt so I figured I picked these up and
I could wear them with some jeans and
sperrys or sandals if it's nice outside
and the last thing I got in San Antonio
was this poncho because one in San
Antonio you got to get a poncho it's
actually more of a bull ha jacket but it
looks like this if you follow me on
Twitter Instagram you probably saw me
post pictures of this me my friends all
got matching Baja jackets just for the
fun of it and I'm so happy we did
because it's just so comfy it's like
police on the inside and it's super cute
and I love it I know people call these
drug rugs but I no to drugs I just
thought it was cute so no hate so then I
went to the Smoky Mountains in Tennessee
with my
sister and her friends and they had some
pretty great outlet mall so I'm going to
go ahead and show you guys what I got
there it's my love and we all love Jake
cruise so I went in and I saw that the
chino shorts were fifty percent off so I
went crazy and I bought two that's why
forward crazy but I got these really
pretty like Oxford colored blue ones
they're so cute they're the 5-inch
Cheetos so they're a little bit longer
and more appropriate which I like they
look like this but there's like a
powdered Oxford color that so it says
I'm not stay fit I also got this really
pretty pair of coral orange ones super
duper cute there are a very different
material but I think they're cute a
little more fancy if some cleats in them
completes a pretty fancy so yep they
look like this and I cannot wait to put
these shorts in a look book or something
because I think they're so cute but yep
those are both originally like fifty
dollars and I got him for like 22 to 25
dollars so well that was a pretty good
deal I then bought a button up and it's
just a polka dot denim button up and I
absolutely love it a lover of button ups
if you know me very very cute I've seen
it and store so many times when i
finally bought it but very simple with
just a bubble necklace and maybe like
some coral pants if i'm feeling saucy
but it was on sale for 37 so i figured i
could justify that so love this and I
love my button-up so very excited to
wear that I then went to the Francesca's
outlet and I got this skirt it's a very
pretty pale pink Chloe high-waisted
skirt with some purple and yellow
flowers on it it's very springy it was
originally $37 notice on sale for 19 and
then I went to the checkout and a 16 so
can't really pass that up very
appropriate it's not too short and
everywhere to church so what this is
very springy and I don't really own that
many
close I figured I be very appropriate I
also went to the CCO for the first time
which is just a cosmetics outlet and I
got my first ever neck product which is
very exciting it's a blush in the shade
stay by me it's very pretty like peachy
pink everyday blush color and I've been
needing a nice everyday blushing so I
picked this up and I figured it was very
pretty very stable but it looks like
that it's a very pretty color oh and
I've never owned a mac product so I'm
really really excited that i bought this
don't really know the original price but
is on sale for 1750 and so so I was in
the Smoky Mountains I got sick and so my
sister Lindsey bought me this bear and
it's so cute just look at it it's
adorable and I so happy I was laying in
bed and she gave moment I was like but
it's so cute and it's going to sit in
the back for the rest of this video but
