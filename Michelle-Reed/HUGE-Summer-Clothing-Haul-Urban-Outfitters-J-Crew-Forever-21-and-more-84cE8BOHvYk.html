summer clothing haul and I'm so excited
to do this because i recently bought
some things to add I've really done a
halt in a really long time so I thought
this would be a very appropriate video
to do so let's just go ahead and get
started so the first store I went to was
j.crew and I went to the j.crew factory
store and everything was fifty percent
off i decided that it would be a good
idea to pick up some things first i
bought a pair of black chinos because i
love the chino shorts they're like a
really good length but i bought this
pair they're just black so they go with
everything and i think they were around
like $25 I then bought this shirt it's
kind of like a baseball tee and its
really soft and cozy and just kind of a
comfy shirt to wear in the summer it's
really a light fabric those holes in it
and I got in a medium so be a little
slouchy on the yeah gnarly like this and
then lastly I just got a pair of jeans
and these are light wash of toothpick
jeans because I've always wanted like a
nice pair of jeans because all if I are
kind of worn out so I really liked this
pair they're just a light wash and
they're really really skinny so I just
rolled them up because I was rolling my
dreams but i really like j.crew jeans so
I think I want to start getting jeans
from there cuz they're really nice
quality so then I ordered from a site
called J simple and this site has really
pretty just basic simple pieces and
they're really comfortable really soft
and they're just really really great
quality the first thing I got was
something that I've been wanting for a
long time and it's a Sun Hat and this
one is adorable it's like it's strong
it's here you'll know as a black bow and
it's so cute like you just take a second
I've always wanted one of these hats to
wear whatever I TN or something and so
I'm so excited I finally have one and I
think that it's adorable and I min
next I got a necklace and they put in
this really cute brown bag which is
really nice it's just a really pretty
Daisy statement necklace and it's like
white and yellow I think it's perfect
for summer and it's just absolutely
beautiful and i love it it's not too
much but not too little it's like the
perfect amount of statement if you know
i'm saying i then got this dress which
is really interesting but it's probably
my favorite thing I got from the store
it's like a black just really like basic
dress but on the sides it has these
cutout kind of things like it almost
looks like a spider on your sleep too
short because usually stuff like this is
incredibly short but this is definitely
a good length and it's really
appropriate and yeah I have no idea
where I'm going to wear this but it's so
cute and it fits you perfectly and I
really really like it next I got this
button up shirt which actually weren't
church today and it's a really pretty
bright pastel colored shirt and it's
kind of like silky and I love button ups
if you know me and so this is kind of a
different one though it's very summer
you found the bright colors and I think
that it's very very nice and comfortable
and a really nice quality button then I
got this shirt which is like a huge
batwing shirt it has like blue and white
stripes and it has huge sleeves and it
honestly is ginormous I didn't really
think it's going to be this big so I
don't really don't want to wear this
place around my house but it's so
comfortable and it's huge and I think if
you feel like three of you in the shirt
but this last thing I got from there is
probably my second favorite thing I got
and it's a scalloped tank top but it's a
really pretty kind of light forest green
color this shirt fits me perfectly and
when you tuck it into high waisted jeans
it just looks so good with my sunflower
shorts and I absolutely love this pink
top is just really light and comfy nice
Jason Pohl is also allowing me to a
giveaway for you guys so make sure to go
like their facebook page and like this
video and just comment down below your
favorite piece that I got that you might
want and you could possibly win the
piece that you want so definitely go
check out the site because I think it's
adorable the stuff is really nice
quality I love it so then I went to my
favorite place
this is urban outfitters and I got a
couple things first I got a pair of
high-waisted shorts and there are these
white kind of cream actually colored I
always did chores with kind of a
braiding on it and they're super cute
and I don't have any white pants at all
so I figure this being appropriate for
summer these were originally sixty
dollars they're on sale for 30 so I
think that was a good deal I then
purchased this shirt and it's a gray
very loose comfortable light shirt for
the summer and it almost is like a
seamless kind of shirt and its really
really comfortable and now it was like
35 dollars which is a little expensive
for something like this but honestly
these kind of shirts or what I live for
so then I went to H&amp;amp;M and I just got one
shirt it's one of these kind of loose
flowy balloon kind of shirts is what I'm
going to call them and it's a little bit
crop so I probably wear this with some
high-waisted shorts or something but i
figured it's a simple piece that i could
wear with a lot of different things so
that's what it looks like i believe it
was around like twenty seven dollars
then i ordered a couple things from
forever 21 the first one being a pair of
shorts there does these kind of flowy
shorts with a little Tyana manned their
floral and very colorful very summery
have like a piece of fabric that they
move apart if you can see and I'm kind
of afraid it's gonna like show my butt
when I wear these so I haven't worn them
yet and I'm kind of scared too but yeah
they're really cute so I hopefully you
know those don't reveal anything I also
got a swimsuit and I love this swimsuit
it's one of the kind of flop ruffle ones
and it's a super bright coral color with
a floral pattern and I like this because
in the back it's just a straight across
back there's no tying or anything so
it's not going to come off I then went
to the gap store and I got this shirt
and its really really wrinkled cuz
already warning a lot so I apologize but
it's a light green color and it's a
checkered pattern very very cute very me
like these kind of shirts are all I
we're really in so I was really happy
that I saw this it was on sale for only
like sixteen dollars which should be no
gap it's usually kind of expensive so
I was very happy that I found this on
sale and lastly I ordered something from
modcloth for a brunch that I had to go
to and it's this very pretty
cream-colored dress with kind of a
Victorian pattern in it and it just goes
down into a skirt with a black kind of
stripe on it really like this dress I
think that it's super cute it also has
an exposed zipper but yeah and so class
he's so pretty and I just absolutely
love this so that's everything that I
got I also want to say this wasn't all
in one trip this is very very collective
so I need not just go out and buy this
much stuff and one trip because I would
be insane let me know when you guys get
out for summer because I'm getting out
in a couple weeks i think like june six
which is really exciting and i'm so so
excited to get back into my filming
schedule and just really crack down the
videos yeah sand of the videos so i hope
you guys enjoyed this bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
