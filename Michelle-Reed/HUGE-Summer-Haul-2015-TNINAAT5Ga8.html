exciting video and it's going to be a
summer clothing haul because summer is
coming up and i needed some new threads
this is a pretty big haul or big for me
michelle because i usually don't buy
this much stuff at a time but i just
kind of accumulated a lot of things that
i wanted to show you guys today give
this video a big like if you like hauls
as much as i do slash if you're ready
for summer because I know I am I believe
that's all I have to say for this in
sure so let's just go ahead and get it
and let's just go ahead and get into
this video we're gonna start off with a
website called choice which is basically
one of those international fashion
websites the first thing is a bralette
and i usually don't wear stuff like this
alone but i wanted something to wear
like underneath some pieces so i got
this one it's just crochet lace and then
in the back there's a zipper so this
isn't the best quality and of course if
you got something like this for free
people it's gonna be better but i didn't
really want to spend a lot of money on
something like this so i got this one
and I got this romper too which I really
like it has that really pretty leaf
pattern on it that's really popular
right now and then it just goes into the
shorts at the bottom and then the back
looks like this Fabray this one's a
little bit out of my comfort zone I not
something that I would wear on an
everyday basis and I kind of had a hard
time figuring out how to style this but
there's a really cool app that I wanted
to show you guys that shows you how to
style clothes and you can get kind of
inspiration from other people it's
called style kick so basically people
will post their outfits on this app and
you can kind of look at them and get
some inspiration and even better if you
like a piece they can recommend pieces
that are similar or the exact same
pieces and you can buy them it's
literally feeding my addiction which is
probably a bad thing but it's really
okay I will take and sometimes it can
give you more affordable options for
your outfits or just nice because I know
a lot of times people do these haul
videos and they show like $200 shirts
and you're like
I can't do that I'm sorry it's just not
something I can do so you should
definitely go follow my profile because
I have like no followers because I just
got this but you should definitely check
it out it's really cool and almost kind
of tumblr s if you know what I mean so
definitely go check it out I will have a
link down below you should definitely go
follow me as well I also got this dress
which I showed in my spring lookbook it
is just a black and white striped almost
like a t-shirt bodycon dress and then it
goes into this kind of asymmetrical hem
so this is really cute and also very
flattering so I really like this I have
this crop top which is very summer s it
has some blue detailing on the front and
then it's just kind of flowy I thought
this would be really cute with maybe
some denim high-waisted shorts or
something
this shirt is my absolute favorite and
I've really been wanting to show you
guys this because I love it it's a navy
blue color crop top it's not super crop
and then it goes into this kind of bell
sleeve which let me tell you I love me
some bell sleeves I have like five
things that have those kind of sleeves
they're just so comfy and cute and this
shirt is a peplum top which is another
one of my favorite styles they're so
flattering and I wear them all the time
but this one is seamless which seamless
shirts are really cool I think
personally this would be great with some
black skinny jeans and maybe like some
heels or something if you're going on a
date or just hanging out with your
friends or something also got this shirt
which is a really pretty crop top and
again it has the bell sleeves it's a
little wrinkly but this is honestly just
too small for me sometimes choice
clothes don't really fit they can
too small for me personally another
thing that I was super excited for but
also did not fit me unfortunately
are these leap shorts I love this
pattern again it has got leaf trying to
going on but these are just some flowy
shorts that are really cute but again
they don't fit me they're just barely
too small like I think I could wear them
but wouldn't look all that great and I
also would not be able to breathe also
about a pair of sunglasses which I am
really excited to show you guys they're
just gold black pretty big sunglasses
that I think are so cute this summer
they are so trendy and so like Tumblr as
I love them I can't wait to show these
in a lookbook coming up or something or
some sort of fashion video because
they're so cute the next are that I
ordered stuff from was Tobi calm and let
me just tell you I love Tobi
I got this shirt which is a very loose
kind of white tunic top and it has two
little strings in the front so you can
tie these or leave them down which is
what I did then it just goes down into a
very loose bottom so I think this is
gonna be super cute over a swimsuit in
the summer like the cover-up this would
be great this next piece is my favorite
thing that I got I am in love with it
it's just a blue plaid dress that goes
down into a little Chloe bottom and the
cut at the top is really pretty too it's
very flattering v-neck I love this it's
something that's a very simple but you
just throw on but it looks so put
together if you know I'm saying next
thing I got is probably my second
favorite thing and it has really pretty
little piping at the top I guess but
it's just a cold shoulder top so there
is no shoulder and then it goes down
into a bell sleeve which you know I love
this I feel like is just the epitome of
summer this shirt is summer in shirt
form I got this crop top which is just a
white loose top with kind of some more
flowy sleeves on it and this is so soft
and comfortable and I think this is
going to be great with some high
shorts I have a pair of sunflower shorts
from American Apparel that I'm totally
check it out with this I think that
those would work really really well
together I got this top which is a very
very colorful pattern top and then it
goes down in the bottom to where the
sides are longer than the middle I don't
really know if that's called but it
looks like that whenever I wear this to
school I got so many compliments so many
people tell me that they love this so I
really like this again I think this is a
very summery shirt this dress just makes
me so happy like looking at it just
brings me happiness but it is a very
pretty tie-dye t-shirt dress very simple
but something that I know I'm going to
wear so often in the summer because it's
just so easy really really like this as
well and then the last thing is the one
thing that really didn't work out for me
but it is a dress and the pattern on it
is really pretty and then it just goes
down and to the bottom and again it has
those bell sleeves but this was just a
little too small for me so maybe it was
a size issue rather than like another
issue because it is a small I think if I
got a medium it would fit right but it
just didn't really fit me now I think it
was supposed to fit that was everything
that I got from Toby so I love Toby I
believe I had a coupon code for you guys
if you want to check it out this down
bar because I'm in love with Toby and
it's going to be my new favorite summer
so yes I went to a thrift store called
Buffalo Exchange which is basically like
a higher-end third store and they have
there are so many fun tees also went to
a high-end through store called Buffalo
Exchange I believe they have a bunch of
them around the country but I got two
things here I got this white tank top
which it's just very flowy and then on
the side it has little fringe which i
think is really really cute and then the
side is kind of like
see almost like a muscle tank so you
definitely have to wear like a bralette
or something that is pretty on the side
but it's very soft and like a good
material and this was sixteen dollars
and it's the brand sweet Claire I also
got a pair of denim high-waisted shorts
and they look like this they are just
very simple and then the bottom has two
little holes on it in the front in the
back I love these I don't know about you
guys but I have such a hard time finding
denim shorts that fit me well because
usually they give me wedgies they just
like go up your butts of length it's not
comfortable but these are a good length
the good fit really liked them these are
actually completely new with the tags
and they're the Brandel it's and I
believe they were $20 so s so it's in
New York City about two weeks ago maybe
three weeks ago and the event I was
going to had a business casual dress
code so I needed to pick up a blazer so
I got this tan like camel color one from
H&amp;amp;M and I love this I cannot wait to
wear this more often but a good material
though like it feels really really nice
I also got these sunglasses from H&amp;amp;M
which I showed at my most my first video
but they're very pretty like colorful
design so I really like them and they're
perfect for summer I also had an
impulsive eye at mate role because when
in New York you have to have it into the
spy it's just like a
but I got this purse and it is a
crossbody bag and leather and SuperDuper
nice I'm not going to go on into detail
about this because I actually have it
what's my price video all about this bag
so you can definitely go check that out
somewhere around here but those are all
the clothes that I have to show you guys
