a haul video for you guys because I
picked up some pieces for the summer
time that I am honestly really excited
about this whole isn't huge or anything
but all the pieces that i have just fit
perfectly and they look really good i'm
really happy about so really excited to
show you guys like always if you happen
to be new to my channel and you just
stumbled across this video you should
definitely subscribe the buckle be right
here and i upload twice a week and i
absolutely love something home videos
because i've been super into fashion and
just finding pieces that are very
different and that I really like and so
let's just go ahead and get to the video
first I ordered from a place called 2020
app which is one of my favorite stores
it's just really really unique pieces
it's an LA based company and they're
really incredible so i will have all the
links down below if you want to check
them out but first I got this romper
which is just a navy blue color and it
has kind of a ruffle and then it goes
off the shoulder it's honestly just such
a cool piece and then it just has the
shorts I love this and I love this color
this is just a color that I never
thought like looked good on me and then
I wore it it was like just come looks
good on me so then I got another romper
which is another great color it's all of
green which is one of my favorites it
just kind of has that two-tier look to
it and then it goes into the shorts its
honestly very very plain but it's just
one of those things that you throw line
you put with psych some heeled shoes and
maybe a cute hat or something it look
really really cute so i like this i have
worn this about three times already and
i got it like last week and the last
thing i got for them it's just a really
cute little suede crop top it's a really
pretty tan color and that just goes cut
them into a high-low and I thought this
would be pretty with a maroon skirt that
I had it's kind of a bodycon skirt and I
never buy crop tops and so I never have
things to wear with the longer pieces
are like shorter cut pieces so
everything that I've ever ordered on
2020 Avenue has been so so cute I also
did a whole lookbook with them so that
might check out this company I love them
and i'll have a link down below so today
i actually went to a thrift store called
buffalo change which is one of my
absolute favorites it's so cool and i
always find the coolest pieces in there
it's kind of
more of a high-end through store first
thing I got is this skirt which oh my
gosh is so pretty it's just a really
cute pencil skirt very very simple it
ties up the waist but the colors they're
beautiful it's like the super pretty
orange and blue and I just think this
skirt is the epitome of summertime and I
cannot wait tour this I think in my work
tomorrow because I absolutely love this
it's originally from zara and it was
fifteen dollars so i got this little
crop top which is very cute it just says
fun day on it again it's orange and grey
up an obsessive orange lately it's the
brand Trey be in and it was fifteen
dollars honestly i would never pay more
than fifteen dollars for sure like this
so as i love thrift shops because good
with that shirt i actually tried on this
pair of like overall dress things
basically it's just overalls and dress
for and it hits a little bit above my
knee I always try on overalls and they
don't fit my body because I just have a
very weird body shape I don't have a lot
of curves or anything and so visa never
I put them on it just does not flatter
my body but this for some reason I just
put it on I really really liked it it's
the great timing and it also has pockets
and this was new with tags and it was
around twenty-five dollars so and then a
while back I placed an order on urban
outfitters and I got this skirt was on
sale for twenty dollars i think and it's
just the prettiest light blue skirt that
ties the waist and it goes down and i
have worn this so many thoughts that
posted a picture on my Twitter and my
instagram i think wearing this but i
just love it i love this color it's so
pretty for the summer time I one of this
top from urban which I end up being too
big but it's just a little cropped shirt
with some ruffles at the bottom it's
like a picnic pattern and I just thought
this would be really pretty for the
summer time but for some reason it's
just very very big it doesn't look big
on camera but it really stretches out it
honestly just doesn't really fit me
right but I didn't return it because I
think i bought it for fifteen dollars or
something on sale but you win some you
lose some
then the last piece I bought is from
nordstrom BP it's like their teen
section i needed a dress for graduation
so i got this one which is very very
pretty it's just a blue pattern and it
goes down and to kind of where the sides
are longer than the front i think my
sister said it's a handkerchief dress
almost like a bandana I just think it's
very different and I have to wear a navy
gown over top so I thought this would
look great with that but guys I really
wanted to get a pair of shoes to wear
for graduation and I had been eyeing his
shoes for the past two months I just
decided today like you know what we're
gonna buy them and so I got them and
they're just these cute lucky heels that
are almost like a wooden I just not real
wood but I love these and it looks
really cute with the dress that I got
these are the brand lucky and I'm so
happy I picked these up they make me so
happy I also got another pair of shoes I
can't remember if I mentioned these in a
haul video but I'm just gonna go ahead
and say I think I talked about it on my
blog channel but I thought these shoes
from made while they're just these cute
little sandals I had a gift card and so
I splurge and I kid you guys not I have
worn these basically every single day
that I got these because they're just
the best sandals they match up
everything you're a killer to break in
but worth it nothin less and now the fun
part swimsuits a while back i bought
this swimsuit and i never liked it so
soon so much and i forgot to put in a
video guys and so here i am now it is a
Billabong one piece that zips right here
in the front and then the bottom goes
into kind of almost like a high waisted
bottle so so cute I have never put on a
one piece that was this flattering and
then area was having basically all of
this swim pieces were fifteen dollars so
like a top a bottom a one piece
everything was fifteen dollars so I kind
of went crazy I got two pairs of bottoms
the first ones they're both high-waisted
but these don't look like this oh no I'm
not gonna try all these swimsuits i'm
pretty sure just because there are
people on the internet that I honestly
just don't want to see me wearing a
swimsuit people are weird they're kind
of creepy and so if you want to see any
of these substitutes stuff like all my
Instagram so i'll probably post them on
there but i got this pair of bottoms
which is so cute it's just black and
white pattern
then it has cute like gold lacing on the
hips and these are so cute it's so
flattering I love high-waisted bottoms
and then I also got a pair that is just
like a really bright coral pink color
personally I have very weird vero hips
that have like dips in them and so swim
bottoms never really look good on me but
whenever I put these on I was like yes
finally bottoms that fit me right and
that I feel comfortable in so then I got
three tops the first one is just a very
simple black top that looks like this
these are the Blakely ones they're my
favorite because they're not push up
there just kind of your standard
comfortable swimsuit of it has a little
tie in it super cute I got this one
which is more of the triangle style and
it has little arrows on it has almost
like a double tie in the back so this
one's really really cute this with a
little more push up which I didn't
realize but it's so cute i like it and
then I got this one which is probably my
favorite but it's just a coral and brown
swim top and then in the back it has
kind of like a braid in it super cute
and it matches the coral Barmes
perfectly and this one matches the coral
blondes really well so really happy with
all the swimsuits I completely ordered
them all offline like on a whim and I
got them and they all looked great Thank

show you guys today I really really hope
