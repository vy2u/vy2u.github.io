subscibers a video because is going to
be a huge unboxing try on back-to-school
clothing all working with the Superbowl
closing company held due to in this
video to show you guys a few pieces that
I really like for back to school
especially in college I'm literally
going to college in two days this is my
last video I plan on filming here today
more like fun back to school videos I've
done it kind of like dress code video if
you want to check those out go see them
but this is not going to be that kind of
video if you're subscribed to your navel
I'm gonna have so many fun college
videos coming up i'm a movin' law school
outfit of the week's video i'm going to
have an apartment tour so many cool
things about subscribe button open oh my
Instagram and my Twitter because of also
to be posting a tunnel on there I also
got back from Boston and put some cute
pictures so it's a shell read if you
wanna check it out literally sent me
this huge bag of clothes I haven't
opened it I thought it would be fun to
just like show you guys my reaction in
person yeah you zip code right here
you'll get 50% off your order
this who has really fun and affordable
back to school fashion so if you're on a
budget it's great I love saving money
because college is so expensive all
these things are under $100 and you get
free shipping if you spend more than $50
and are also running a competition where
you can win a $500 shopping spree to do
so I will have that link in the
description along with the coupon code
and boo-boo in general so just go ahead
and get Renton's to you as you can tell
our room i'm such a girly girl i love
pink so I saw this on the website and I
was like I have to have it it's this
super pretty baby pink cropped kind of
denim jacket as faux fur on the collar
I wear a ton of black I wonder dated
always telling Michelle you look so
going to color why do you never wear
color so I was like all about it all so
it was kind of the same and that it also
has that kind of like so she almost
collar on it but it's just a very long
denim jacket it's also so cute like some
black high-waisted jeans and some
booties and I like this going to look
like something that used to rip suit
it's like almost has a more vintage feel
to it oh my goodness
is color is so perfect I love
blush pink and so I got this really big
like oversized kind of jumper which I
honestly thought I could wear this with
leggings and boots in the fall time it's
really long and just so pretty I am
obsessed it's going to be so cute to
bundle up with even of jeans I feel like
this would still be really cute love
pink so much guys now I still normally
order pants online because I just have
like weird legs pants don't normally sit
so we will see if these actually fit
they look like they may be a little bit
big of these jeans that have like a
little pearls on them which I thought
was different I don't anything like
these and so I just thought it'd be fun
to try something new they're like a
light wash Jean and they just go down
but they look like they may be a little
bit too big and they have rips in the
knees which will be cute the nice
addition if you want to kind of try
something else that's a little bit
different the next thing is an overall
set I like this because it's really like
a light material and it's like a
periwinkle blue color and it's just like
a little dress I think they call this a
pinafore dress really really pretty out
anything that is this color and it's
always still going to be warm for a
while so even this is like a long-sleeve
shirt I think would be really cute
especially like this for the color I
think the colors is is really really
beautiful I got this skirt which is
really simple it is just like a faux
suede black skirt it's just like very
very plain that I wear my black skirts
to class all the time so I have a dress
code and so I thought this would be
great with tights and boots in the
wintertime you know without boots and I
don't know on pockets which is great
some pretty thin material so it'll be
great when it's still warm outside so
you can wear suede but not be like
really hot really like it
giraffes which i thought was so pretty
and it's just a gingham little rustle
dress and then in the bottom it just has
like a ruffled bottom so it's horrible
even if it's like converse I think would
be really pretty
I love gingham and even though summer is
like almost over I'm still going to wear
this and then in the back you just have
and keep tailing Dow which is also kind
of a nice addition to it I'm so excited
to finally have something of ginghams it
feel quite really really I got this
purple dress it's just a really pretty
purple color and I thought this would be
nice with a belt and it also has pockets
and it's really plain and simple but I
wear this kind of stuff a lot to class
because it's just plain you could dress
it up then it just has like quarter
length C I think is a little bit
different I don't normally like get
stuff like this so I just thought it
would be cute maybe for like a fun
outfit which is the t-shirt and it says
girls gang on it and it has pearls on it
and I'd also something cute with like a
denim skirt and converse a fun little
graphic tee I literally go on anything
like this but my thing is also gingham
and I thought that it was very different
it's just a blouse that has like a
v-neck and then the sleeves kind of puff
out if you actually tie them I believe
and I don't feel something pretty with
like white skinny jeans or just white
pants for class again I'm a gingham
so I'm so excited to rock on my cute
genome clothes I put on this little
skirt which is pretty small a little
thing might be a little bit easier but
if I wear like nude undergarments will
probably work really pretty kind of hand
brown color it ties and has kind of a
slowing waist again in the very summery
piece but I mean there's still like time
in summer I'll do like goes with my
headband
to kind of has a bohemian vibe to it and
just like a white t-shirt or something
and again like converse that needs to be
really cute or as I got this skirt which
is another like faux suede material it's
a really pretty kind of maroon burgundy
color this is just a pencil skirt so
this is again going to be really nice
for class especially in like the
Christmas time this is going to be
really pretty for winter or if you wear
this is black and then like some cute
vans or something I think that would be
even be cute for club I'm going to do
because everything is on the website you
know they have like nice stuff they have
things that you can wear their casual
for class it's just kind of like a
one-stop shop to get all your school
stuff I was look at this top from guru
which is just striped and I felt them
too rude and black on it was really cute
and it's like a really thick material
but it's really stretchy so I want to be
cute tucked in with something really
plain shirts definitely
in handy when styling things and I
thought the mustard yellow was really
cute
you're the last thing that I got is just
a pair down short actually don't own any
denim shorts and so I thought things
would be cute
it'd have a little butterfly on them and
they're like an acid-wash you might be a
little bit short for me I don't normally
wear shorts are super short but I
thought that they might be fun I was
going out and running errands or
something and not really like caring
exactly what I look like that was
officially everything in my blue bag I'm
so excited to wear all these clothes and
don't forget to check out Zuzu along
with all the crazy good sales and I
talked about it because I'm so excited
to hit them up again links will all be
down below time to go watch my last
video and look out in my college videos
I love you guys so much I'm so much
sitting here on YouTube and I hope you
guys have a great day and I'll see you
at my next one bye friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
