hair care routine i get requested this
all the time like michelle how do you
keep it here so healthy well have you
asked me how I get my hair so just long
and I don't know how it is I want to say
before i start i don't use any product
in my hair besides like shampoo and
conditioner i don't put anything in my
hair loss it's hairspray or something i
just think that's my number one key to
keeping my hair nice whenever you use a
lot of products here is going to get a
lot like way down and I just don't find
it necessary to use any products in my
hair soap or shampoo and conditioner I
just used the redken all soft this is my
all-time favorite it keeps my hair super
soft and super healthy so I have the
shampoo and then i have the conditioner
and i just use these i wash my hair
about every other day or so so yeah
definitely recommend these if you want
softer hair a lot of people tell me that
i should use heat protectant and stuff
for my hair i just don't find it
necessary I just feel like overtime heat
protectant ways down my hair it makes me
feel gross I just rather have my natural
just clean products free hair and yeah
so let's get ahead into the demo hair
care routine stuff yeah so first I'm
just taking my hair out of its towel and
yes it was a little bit dry because I
like to air dry at first and then I'm
just brushing it out and now I'm gonna
take my Revlon blow dryer I don't really
know the exact time it's just a blow
dryer and I'm just blow drying my hair
until it is dry and you know having some
singing moments then I'm just brushing
my hair out and I think I got an eyelash
mine or something right here oh no is
really funny though mmm rooms a mess so
now i'm taking my cheese straightener
i'm just gonna turn it on and do random
stuff while it's ease heating up so now
i'm taking just a bow clip and I'm penny
back my bangs and then I'm just
straightening my hair i'm pretty sure
but he knows how straighten their hair
of candy
and that is all I do for my hair it's
not a lot but all I need you guys

questions in the comments or requests or
