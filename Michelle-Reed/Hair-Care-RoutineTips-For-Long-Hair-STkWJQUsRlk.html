hair care routine / tips in just how I
keep my hair very long this is more
prone to long hair and this is just what
i do i get a lot a lot of questions on
my hair and just how i keep it long and
healthy and i did a hair care routine
i'm not too long ago but it wasn't very
informative so i just decided to do a
whole video dedicated to my hair because
it's been requested so first I'm just
gonna start off with like what I do in
the shower I know a lot of people film
them doing their hair in the shower but
I think that's kind of creepy basically
the shampoo conditioner i use is all
soft by redken i've been using this for
like a year or so and it keeps my hair
nice and soft and not brittle and i love
it it's just my favorite shampoo so for
shampooing my hair I just take my
shampoo and I put it in the roots of my
hair and just kind of massage it I guess
and then I rinse it out just like any
normal person shampoos her hair with
conditioner I like to put it in the ends
of my hair so about here down and then I
just put my hair up in a bun with the
conditioner in it and I shave my legs
and wash my body and then I rinse it out
afterwards this way you're here is more
of like a deep condition versus just
putting it in and rinsing it out it just
really deep conditions your hair and
makes my hair a lot softer I've noticed
so then when i get out of the shower I
just brushed my hair I know I should
probably use a wide tooth comb but my
hair gets so tamely it's very fine like
that's the texture of my hair and so
using why tooth comb is literally
impossible I can't even do it so I like
to let my hair air dry for about 20
minutes and then I will blow dry it
under the only products I use is the
kenra platinum silken gloss this makes
my hair so shiny and so soft it's like
my main product it makes my hair so help
it also smells really good souls really
fruity and I like it because the scent
lingers in hair afterwards so your hair
basically always smells like fruity and
that's awesome I wash my hair in the
morning I will blow dry it just because
I have stuff to do and I'll have time to
air dry it but but if I take a shower at
night I definitely let my hair air dry
instead of blow drying just because I
like to
use the least amount of heat as possible
if I do use heat I will use my thermal
creations tresemme protected spray which
I actually broke this in the process of
the video I don't know if I got that on
camera but so I kind of just had to pour
it out my fingers and then put it
through what you gotta do what you gotta
do but this just protects my hair from
the heat if I blow dry it I just use a
little revlon blow-dryer it's something
special and in the beginning I kind of
just like to flip my hair over and blow
dry it just to give it more volume and
then towards the end when it's about 80%
dry i would say i just like to kind of
tilt it down and brush this makes my
hair very straight so i don't really
have to straighten it that much um then
I just kind of like to put the brush in
the blow dryer together and glide it
down and this just makes my hair a lot
straighter and so I don't have to
straighten it as much as possible as far
as straightening my hair goes I really
don't straighten it basically at all
especially in the summer because I don't
care that much to already pretty
straight as you can see after I blow
drying it so I don't really feel the
need to occasionally I like my hair to
be very straight like if I'm going out
so I just use my cheese straightener
I've had it for years and I just kind of
straighten the front pieces a little bit
just to kind of tidy up my hair and I
use he presented so it's all good i know
it does it protect completely but it's
better than nothing i guess so let us
everything as far as hair care routine
goes it's nice and simple easy practical
which is what i like I feel like the
less products you use and the less stuff
you do your hair the better and
healthier it is so I'm just going to
talk about my hair and a lot of
frequently asked questions i get so the
first one would be how often do I wash
my hair and that would be about every
two days or so I don't like to wash my
hair every other day that's what I
wouldn't tell your eyes not to do you
don't want to get rid of all the natural
oils some of those oily things are good
for your hair so definitely I would
recommend washing your hair the least
amount as you can but still keep your
hair clean because you don't want dirty
here also a lot of people ask me what I
asked for when I get my hair cut um this
is my natural hair color I never get my
hair dyed I don't plan on it because I
feel like that's so bad for your hair
especially if you do it like once a
month it just makes your hair really
frizzy and just not nice and so I like
to keep my hair it's like the heat my
ear die for you because
is what works for me when I go to the
hair salon I've been going to my
hairdresser for years and I always get
the same thing which is just a little
bit of trim I just get about this much
trimmed I would say and then I'll
sometimes get long layers or my bangs
cut which I need to get it caught
because I've gotten a haircut forever so
yeah that's why I asked for just maybe
long layers a little bit of a trim like
I said very simple and easy i'm not a
very dangerous person the other thing I
get is how to grow out your hair because
that's such a frequently asked question
up I've had long hair ever since I was
little I might insert some pictures mom
just never really cut my hair and she
got told so much like you need a cop
Michelle's hair it's all been her face
but she never really did I'm so happy
because it's how I've had my hair so
long and if she cut it it probably
wouldn't be this long today so I
definitely have always had long hair but
I'm on how to keep it long just don't
use heat that often don't dye your hair
that often drink lots of water I know
they're vitamins you can take but I just
don't know anything about that so I'm
not going to recommend it I'm very long
hair that grows really easily so I can't
really say four people have short hair
but I just always had long hair and I
don't really know honestly that many
tips but those would be my main threes
just drink lots of water don't use that
much heat and don't dye your hair that
often and that's what keeps my hair nice
or if you're used to using heat every
day maybe try going every other day I do
use heat on my hair i'm human and my
hair I would still say it's pretty okay
so i just don't like to use it every
single day and keeps my hair and ice and
heats free so with all that being said
that is everything about my hair if you
have any other questions make sure to
email me that's probably the best way to
go or comment down below and i will try
to answer your questions and like the
studio if this helped you at all and
i'll see you guys my next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
