hair routine video I haven't done one of
these forever I'm gonna talk a little
bit about my hair before I actually get
into like what I do on a daily basis my
hair is naturally very very straight
this is straightened but I do have
naturally very straight hair I also have
very naturally healthy hair so I don't
have to use a whole lot of products I
don't like to use a lot of products I
don't think it's very healthy for your
hair I get my hair cut every of like
four months or so I'm trying to grow it
out really long this is how long it is
right now if you're interested I know
like long hair is the big thing like
long hair don't care but so the shampoo
that I use is the red kunal soft shampoo
it's just leave this kind I've used this
for so long I don't like to change up my
hair products I don't know and I
actually ran out of the conditioner but
I usually use this conditioner as well
but right now I'm using a sample of this
pure ology one this is amazing I want to
say it's making my hair so so soft and
it smells really good it smells like
mint tea so this is my hair and I'm
gonna go ahead and get into the video
first I'm just gonna take my hair out of
towel I'm just gonna brush it out a
little bit
so I use the Garnier Fructis anti-frizz
serum been using this for about a year
now I love it it makes my hair so soft
so I get about that much on my hand and
then I just kind of worked this through
the ends of my hair
and then I'm just gonna brush it out
so once my hair is all brushed out and
stuff I'm just gonna blow drying it I
used this little Revlon blow-dryer it's
really tiny than what I normally use my
sister took with her so I don't have it
so I can use this one but I mean I don't
think using like a hundred dollar
blow-dryer really makes a big of a
difference on my hair personally
so my hair is still a little bit damp so
I'm gonna go chill on my bed for like
two minutes until it's completely dry
and I'm back hair is now dry and this is
like my natural blow-dried hair so so
next I'll be straightening my hair and I
know some of you guys are thinking why
are you straighten your hair it's
already straight stupid cuz I know it
makes my hair a lot smoother and just
less frizzy so yeah the stream i'm going
to use is my chi it's just pink this is
the Breast Cancer Awareness one but it's
a ceramic sheet I've used this for two
years now I think I don't do any like
crazy sectioning off or anything because
obviously my hair is already pretty
straight so I'm just gonna clip my bangs
back and I'm gonna go on Instagram until
it's done heating up
I don't like straighten my hair in any
specific way I kind of just take pieces
in the street
that is all I do for my hair just on
like an everyday basis well that's kind
of it so I will see you guys in my next
video I am BA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
