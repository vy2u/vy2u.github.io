shopping recently and I bought a few
things and decided to show you guys as
usual I like to hmm forever 21 ulta
target and i think that's it so I'm just
going to go ahead and get first I want
to forever 21 and I got the dress that
I'm wearing it's just a jean dress it's
really comfortable and I like it because
it's addressed but it's still like
capitals not super fancy or anything so
you can wear it's more casual things and
it's really comfortable and I really
like it i feel like it's really summery
and i don't own anything similar to this
so yeah I also think it was around
twenty four dollars i want to say it was
like 24 i also bought this shirt it's
just a light pink button-down shirt and
its really light it's pretty see-through
side where a bandeau under it I wear
this in my most recent fashion video in
I love it it's really really light so
it's perfect for summer because you're
not going to sweat or anything in it and
I like to wear this with like some
colorful shorts and I really like it i
also feel like you could be like a
swimsuit cover-up or something yeah i
think this is around $17 it was probably
like 17 so that I went to hmm and I
found this piece it was originally $25
but it's on sale for seven and it's just
a lace crop top so it short sleeve and
it's a crop top and then the back is
just kind of shared it has a zipper and
like this because I feel like I prepare
so just like a pair of shorts or
something and be really easy and simple
which is a pair like high-waisted shorts
is really like for summertime because
you it gets really hot where I live I
cannot do stuff that's heavy so I really
like this it's really comfortable really
nice and simple and also from H&amp;amp;M I
bought a pair of pants these are like
kind of light green sage green mint I
don't even know where his color is long
capris early like them they're really
really comfortable again they're light
and perfect for summer they're really
nice material they feel like really well
made and they just have my buttons on
the back and they were originally thirty
dollars but they were all too
20 i guess this $20 sticker usually I'm
a two in like Chino style capris like
these but these I could not even get a
to pass tips so I would definitely
recommend going two sides up if you're
planning on getting a freeze like this
for major also their matron em I got
this bracelet it also came with like a
cool colored one by the fans of my
sister's car so just a pink color and
then it has like a gold clasp on the
back and it's really cute really nice
pop of summer I mean I don't feel like
it's very good quality but i think it
was only like seven dollars or something
so yeah just a nice pop of color to add
with my watches or whatever but i like
to alta if you had a rewards thing so we
were on level eight and so I got a free
perfume up to $45 so I decided to get
the DZ by marc jacobs wine because it's
a nice summary sent and i love it just
like the curse travel set comes like
this and i gave the other one to my mom
because she really liked this sent to
but the bottle was so cute it looks like
this it's just a flowery summer scent it
kind of smells like honeysuckle and for
what's not like the gross Graham only
perfume floral what no I also comes with
a little gold bit which I feel like is
to transfer this from the first travel
one but I mean I'm really you know so
grand out of hairspray so I got the
shape of blush Sebastian hairspray this
is my favorite hairspray and as on say
over ten dollars so we kind of stocked
up in my family it's my favorite because
it's not very like crunchy if you know
what i mean is very i don't really like
to have a whole bunch of hole in my hair
I like to let it go a little bit wavy
and not so structured so I really like
this hairspray / about that at Target I
got a few things the first one is the
revlon nail art 3d jewel athletes
they're basically just nail stickers and
they're really pretty pattern they're
like it really pretty blue red and
floral the kind of glittery I have it on
right now on if you can tell but I like
these a lot better than the sally hansen
ones i think they're a little bit more
expensive they were like $11 just a
little expensive but it's really easy to
use and I've had these out for two days
and they're going strong I would like
put these on every single one right now
so I think these are nice just kind
an accent NASA a few beauty products the
first one is the Revlon nearly naked
makeup I've been wanting a new
foundation well that's a pretty light
for summer and this one seems like a
nice light foundation I'm in the shade
120 vanilla I have it on today looks
like this i just used a sponge and i
really like it it's pretty sheer it
doesn't offer too much coverage but it's
for the summer so i don't need that much
coverage and i really like this i think
it was around seven or eight dollars so
i also got a waterproof version of my
favorite mascara which is the Maybelline
rocket volume mascara this is my
all-time favorites and for the summer
time I just wanted a waterproof 11 sweat
off or anything you're looking for a
really great drugstore mascara i
definitely recommend this one it gives
lots of length and volume it's just
overall a really great mascara the last
thing that i got in this haul video was
another color tattoo for mainly i love
these so much this one's in edgy emerald
and it's a really nice just turquoise
blue color and I got this to wear as
like an accent color underneath my lash
line it's a nice different color and I
never really about yourself wearing
something like this but I tried it out
the other day and I really liked it i
think i'm going to do like a waterproof
makeup tutorial or something i probably
use this in it so i really really like
this is also last so long like you go
swimming this it sitting in my whole
video and i hope you guys enjoyed this
let me know if you have any video
requests and you call it down below

will have lots and lots of more time to
fill the things the lord i only have
