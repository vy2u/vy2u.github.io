for you guys today I went shopping with
my two brothers and my sister Jamie and
I got some stuff as you can see so first
i went to H&amp;amp;N they just opened one like
and the mall closest to me so don't have
to go an hour away to the nearest one
and i got is a sweater of course it's
just like brown it is really chunky in
it and it's just totally me I wear these
all the time i'm wearing a sweater right
now i also got a pair leggings because i
want to wear these with like a long
sweater and my boot so there's black
legging something too special i also got
some leg warmers these are just the one
pack of leg warmers and they look like
this they're chunky kind of knit kind of
look to them and they're really really
cute and i cannot wait to wear these
lastly from H&amp;amp;M I just got a pack of
socks because I needed some and they
were only 95 and i went to american
eagle and i got a few things the first
thing as a pair of yoga pants these are
just like cropped black ones or they're
like skinny so I mean this or just
really plain and black and then I
purchased a pair of my favorite jeans
these are the skinny jeggings I love
these our these so much i got wearing my
pair like three times a week or
something because i love them they're so
comfortable side on another pair they're
just dark wash and they're skinny and
then I got this sweater and is so cute
so I could look at it it's gray and it
has white lace and it's just really
comfortable it's cuter on it's adorable
and usually I don't buy stuff from
American Eagle because a lot of people
have it with this I couldn't pass up
because it's cute my brother shops at
j.crew and I don't like usually buy
stuff there because it's not really my
style and I saw this and I love these
there like the little head wraps it's
like a tan color and it's knitted so
cute and I love it my sister lindsay has
one like this so my sister jamie also
bought this one and i was just really
attracted to it it says it's $25 but
when the lady rang it up it was only 13
so so looks really crazy right now go
make it work in winter time
hair to be curled too so yeah but it's
really comfy and I've seen people wear
these help really cute so I just went
ahead and bought it and it was only like
thirteen dollars so also went to banana
republic and again I don't show up there
but i found this bracelet it's pretty
plain it's just like diamond ii and it
looks like that so i always wear this
pro bracelet so I thought they'd look
cute together to where and you know why
not and then a week ago I went to kohls
and tell that they recently started
selling Essie nail polish so I got three
of them and they're all pretty like
fallen neutral colors the first one is
chin chili and it looks like this it's
like a dark it's almost like a purpley
grey it's really pretty it's more purple
in person and then I got one of these
luxe effects nail polishes of one of
these forever and this is inset and so
it's just the silver glitter one and
it's so pretty it's just a ton of
different like shaped glitter and it's
just gorgeous for accent nails and then
the last color i got is san Tropez and
it's just like a neutral kind of cool
tone beige it's really pretty my nails
are painted right now but it's really
pretty i also got all of these for free
because i had these like ten dollar
coupon gift cards and my uncle gets well
i just felt like one at a time at ball
one of these just ended up getting them
for free so i hope you guys enjoyed this
video and yeah and like and check the
