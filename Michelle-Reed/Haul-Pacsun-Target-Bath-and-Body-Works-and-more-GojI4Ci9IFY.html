a few things there and I also just went
to target so I wanted to do a haul of
some stuff that I bought
Pharrell passed up in from Target and I
had so much fun in El Paso is great like
meeting all villains families if you
guys didn't know I went there that's
where I was so yeah I'm just gonna go
ahead and do a whole I'll start off with
this stuff I got from El Paso and we
went to these outlet models and we went
to PacSun and I bought something else
there's just like a plain shirt but it's
in the wash already worn it got this
shirt it looks like this it's really
pretty it's like coral and floral and
old world and it's really sheer and just
flowy and then the back kind of looks
cool it's got like little cutouts and
yeah this is really really cute it's
from the brand Kiera and I think it was
nineteen dollars and then Bath and Body
Works is having their sales so I bought
a couple things too like body splashes
the first one is coconut lime and this
was only three dollars is in like those
bins and really good I'm wearing this
today it just smells morning line than
coconut but it's a very like fruity some
recent like out of breath and then I
bought this pink fresh vanilla is dream
on body splash which smells like summer
in a bottle I love this this was only
like nine dollars I think it was half
off only nine dollars which is actually
kind of expensive for this but I'm
really it's really worth it cuz then I
got a candle this is Tiki Beach um this
smells amazing smells
what is clipping it gross and like thank
me kids it was just toasted coconut
vanilla musk and tropical island origin
this was only five dollars it was half
off so yeah I didn't want to get a huge
one cuz I'd have to bring it back my
luggage as you can see I don't want to
have to like I don't know and then we
went to this place called the jewelry
box and I got a few jewelry pieces but
I've already wore them and I like to
show stuff that I've already like used
so I'm not going to you guys not but I
got three nail polishes the first one is
catch me yeah yeah no I'll be on a
second
it's like a blue color and then this one
is TLC it's like a bright make green
this is just like a vitamin thing and
these are all only $1 so yeah they're
pretty good for only being a dollar I'll
order this one super and Victoria's
Secret I just thought I'd show you it's
like mint green and it's a band don't
hash drops so cute I love this I think
this is like $25 so Q has a little bow
in the middle and I went to Target
couple seconds ago and I got makeup
remover cleansing towelettes these are
my favorite sorry I'm rushing except
this one but I got the blue Revlon creme
shadows and not just nudes everybody has
these I think and I'm so late on them
but I wanted to buy them they look like
that um i've swatched these already
because it kind of got excited and
they're not like amazing like the
Maybelline Color tattoos but I mean
pretty and I'll probably use these a lot
I got the Essie nail polish and
turquoise and caicos already have this
but it's kind of gotten like chunky so I
got a new one and it's just a really
pretty turquoise color it's coming on
pretty true to colors yeah oh my sister
caught this it's shirring sand so I
covered a roll but I just bought that
for I'm nice so that's all I bought I
