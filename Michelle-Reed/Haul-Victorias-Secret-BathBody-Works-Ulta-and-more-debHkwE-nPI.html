in my giveaway video some things for
myself not three things here um first
thing is you maybelline color tattoo any
color barely branded this is part of the
metal line or something like that it
looks like this it is so pretty it's
just a really nice like nude kind of
shimmery color I'll swatch this bad boy
so it looks like that is just really
pretty and really natural these two
things are for my valentines day makeup
tutorial i'm gonna fill I got a NYX lip
gloss this is just the mega shine lip
gloss or so cute um this is in the color
nude pink so it looks like that in the
bottle okay NYX lip products literally
smell amazing this Mel's like candy and
swatched it looks like that it's just a
really pretty color here that's what it
looks like on and it's really pretty
last thing I got from Ulta was the NYX
jumbo eye shadow pencil and strawberry
milk the color of it looks like this is
just a really pretty shimmery pink color
looks like thats watched I figured this
kind of looks Valentine's Day II it
would work out i went to victoria's
secret and i got a swimsuit and before
you go crazy like michelle's January why
are you getting swimsuit have a dance
competition at the end of februari and
at our hotel and pretty sure there's
gonna be a pool so we're probably end up
swimming and I just need a swimsuit so
that's one of these like bandeau styles
and it looks like this it's so cute it
looks like confetti and it just has a
ton of different colors in it and its
really really really pretty on and I
just really like this and I feel like
you look really good if I get tan cuz
you I'm kind of pale right now but I so
love how it kind of has like all this
will like rouging right here for bottoms
I just got these that like really bright
make green whoa watch my face gets all
shadowy but they're like bright bright
mint green and they're really pretty and
I think that they go really well with
these swimsuit
oh so cute also wet to Bath and Body
Works and I don't even know we got here
for a bathroom we needed some more soap
so we just got the island breeze one and
yeah what's it smell like I remember I
just smells really clean and fresh
everybody's getting all spring timing so
how to get you some I think my mom got
this kitchen mandarin kitchen soap she
was talking about she needed some
kitchen so then my mom also just got
some like room spray in wallflowers the
target this is really boring but I
needed a like garment bag thing to put
my dance costumes in so I got this
little packet to also about a week ago I
went to H&amp;amp;M and I got a couple sweaters
so I figured I'd show you guys and i
already wore one of them in my outfit of
the week's video but this is the first
one it's like a really bright green i
adore these they're so soft they're so
comfortable i want to wear this like
every single day i work to sleep a lot
to like humping kind of baggy they
didn't have any small so this is a
medium but i just kind of where it a
little bit bigger asked about this tan
one and it looks like this and this
one's really comfortable as well I wear
this with scarves a lot so comfortable
and I've been wearing them like crazy
and I want to go get like all the other
colors because I really love them so
