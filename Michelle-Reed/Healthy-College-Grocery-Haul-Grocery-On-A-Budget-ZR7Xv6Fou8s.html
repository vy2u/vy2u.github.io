Michelle Reed and today's video is gonna
be a little bit different I've never
done something like this but it's going
to be a college grocery haul so I'm in
college and I don't have a meal plan
which means I have to cook all of my
meals which means I have to buy
groceries which means I can do a grocery
haul for you guys so I like to shop at
Trader Joe's because I think it's so
much cheaper than shopping anywhere else
in the city unless you go to like a
farmer's market or something but like a
typical grocery store in New York is so
expensive and it's pretty much like
double the price than what I'm used to
in Texas but Trader Joe's is all normal
prices and I really like it so this I'm
about to show you is eighty two dollars
total I normally spend around 40 but I
had to get like double as much because I
haven't gone in like literally two weeks
I don't know what I've been eating it's
kind of scary
these are the things I usually buy
obviously this varies but these are kind
of like my essentials so let's just go
ahead and get right into it so starting
with bag one and here I just have a
thing a whole wheat bread you just tell
you all Michelle told me what if I had
to get acupuncture she'd vlog it so stay
tuned I really like having avocado toast
I really wish they have half clothes
because I never go through a whole low
baby on a trade show ever I go where's
your stop being age they get like one
more processed item and this time it was
these pretzels I love these they're
really good I got a thing of grapes I
love grapes they last around if you
freeze them they're also really good
they taste like candy I also got a thing
of bananas and these are like the most
yellow one so I just picked up these I
love having bananas all my oatmeal I go
through apples so quickly and : just cuz
they're like the perfect little snack
and I really like these ones these are
the Honey Crisp apples or my favorite
and this is the essential every time I
go to Trader Joe's I try to try out a
different peanut butter but the crunchy
almond butter is definitely my favorite
I mean peanut butters are at Trader
Joe's there's like 20 I also got some
asparagus and mushroom mix now if I was
like cooking for like a big group of
people I wouldn't get these cuz they're
really expensive but since it's just me
I could like go through this in two
meals and it kind of like makes up for
it but I also got some zucchini noodles
zucchini noodles are really good and you
put them with sauce they're delicious I
also got some unsweetened flaked coconut
really good on some yogurt or oatmeal I
can just feel your judgement I also got
a thing of honey which honey is so
expensive but it takes a while to go
through but I just ran out so si got
some butternut squash because squash is
really good and every time it turns into
fall I just really like squash every
time it turns I also got some crumbled
goat cheese because this stuff is so
good on salads and I really really like
it I'm gonna make one tonight a last
thing in this first bad veggie burgers
these are frozen ones I love these these
are the quinoa with black beans and
roasted corn I like to eat them with
ketchup for greens I got two sets we
have some baby spring mix and then also
just an urge salad mix and these expire
really quickly so it makes me like eat
my vegetables
cuz I have to it was another thing at
strawberries strawberries are really
good on yogurt and these are the foxy
ones I don't really know that much about
but they're the only ones that treated
Jews I got a thing of great tomatoes
because I like to eat these on salads I
got a whole thing of dates
I love dates some people hate dates but
dates with almond butter is like the
perfect sweet snack I just love that a
my new like obsession at Trader Joe's
has been these salmon burgers but
roommate Haley knows I make these like
pretty much every night they're just so
good and you don't have to like mess
around it's like cutting me you just
stick them on like the sauteing pan and
you make them and they're really good so
these are just the premium salmon
burgers I'm still got two avocados I
only got two because all the condos are
freaking expensive and then I got two
cans of things I got canned corn and
then also canned beans and again I like
to put these on salads and then I got a
huge tub of Greek yogurt because I love
having you over in granola in the
morning I basically have overnight notes
or granola and yogurt every morning to
work frozen things I got frozen broccoli
and then some frozen mixed berries and
then the last two things I got three
sweet potatoes because I have sweet
potatoes pretty often and then I also
got some coconut aminos these are really
good and replace of salad dressing or if
you put it on me it's also a good sauce
but it's like healthier for you and it
kind of tastes like soy sauce so I
definitely recommend trying it out so
that is all for my grocery haul I hope
