creepy tell someone ha I say I'm going
to be doing an advice video for you guys
all about high school I ask four
questions on my Instagram like always I
just have the most followers on that so
that's what I use because I figure it
will reach a lot of you guys so you
should definitely follow me on there
it'll be right here if you want to be
featured in my next advice videos
because they do these pretty octaves
also I want to know it's if the AC is a
little noisy I'm really sorry there's
just no way I can turn it off because it
is a hundred and three degrees today and
so if I was to film without it I would
be a sweaty mess so please excuse that
noise now we're just gonna go ahead and
get into it a Miku drone 13 asks how to
manage AP classes with all the other
activities that you do I started taking
AP classes my sophomore year and it's
definitely just figuring out what works
for you just make sure you do your work
immediately when you get home and don't
sit on your laptop for an hour because
you're really gonna lose motivation I
mean grab a snack or something but just
get home and start doing your homework
just think of all the things that you'll
be able to do once you're done with your
homework and that kind of sort of
motivates Madison Eliza and C asks how
many extracurriculars are too many you
should be getting involved right away or
wait it's a second semester or sophomore
year definitely get involved as soon as
you can because that's when you can
start making friends join my dance team
at my freshman year actually the summer
before my freshman year and I met so
many awesome people and so definitely
get involved as soon as you can freshman
year is also a great year because you're
not going to have the hardest classes it
may seem like they're hard at the time
but it gets harder I'm sorry to say but
you want to meet friends as quickly as
you can and I feel like the best way to
do that is joining clubs as
stereotypical and cliche as it sounds
quirky not dorky asks how do you deal
with losing friends you used to be
really close with and how to do
Mean Girls I can say there weren't
really Mean Girls when I went to high
school and I know middle school it's
more like that but not so much in high
school but you are gonna lose friends I
can say I'm literally not friends with
like hardly anybody that I was friends
with in middle school but it's okay
if it happens it happens and it's
natural people change that's just a
grade where you really figure out what
you want to do what you want to best
your time in and so you won't
necessarily have the same friends but
it's okay because you will meet more
friends I promise
Natasha Margaret asked what are the top
five things that are most important to
learn within the first week one figure
out where your classes are and get a
nice pathway to where you can get to
class quickly and not be you lagging
behind and tardy to finding new friends
finding new lunch buddies I think is
important you really want establish who
your lunch crew is three figure out your
school supplies and what works and what
doesn't I know my freshman year I bought
way too much crap to be honest for know
which classes are going to be hard and
know which ones you're gonna have to
work a lot at that's very important and
then find how to enjoy the year and have
a good time because high school is not
that bad and you want to be able to
enjoy that so Rhea asked dance team at
vine / experience and a lot of people
ask me about my dance team so I'm just
gonna talk about it really quick here
you can skip over this question if you
don't care I do have practices at 7 a.m.
every morning which is not the dream but
it teaches me to wake up early and work
hard and it's also gonna work out so
that's awesome I have met a lot of
friends and it has just been a pretty
good experience so if you are interested
in joining your dance team if you have a
Lynn I would definitely recommend this
Andrea Dutra asks how do you keep up
with everything like sports and clubs
and outside of school activities also
crazy guys hitting on you a lot of
people exaggerate how hard dealing with
a lot of things at once is it's not that
bad I mean personally I've been on my
dance team doing YouTube and I have
managed to get pretty good grades and
so maybe tez and it's possible I'm still
saying I mean sometimes I have my days
but it just depends on what works for
you and you really have to prioritize
your time and the limits some things
that aren't as important far as the
crazy guys go I haven't had a whole lot
of experience with this if someone is
stalking you and being creepy tell
someone it's all I can say star 300 won
2-6 asks you have any tips on how to
calm down during presentations I'm
really shy so presentations aren't
exactly my strong suit thank you and I
love you so much Elly - I actually took
speech my sophomore year of high school
so if you're not already required to
take it definitely take speech force
yourself to talk in front of people it's
such an important skill that you need to
learn usually if you're in a class doing
presentations everyone's gonna have to
do one so just know everyone's nervous
they're feeling the same way that you're
feeling and it's gonna be okay
and that's all I can say Kenna Jay asked
how is it having no classes with any of
your friends and from personal
experience I can tell you usually the
class where I didn't know a lot of
people ended up being the most fun
classes I don't know why distract up a
conversation with someone and try to
make some friends because I can tell you
those classes couldn't end up being very
fun along with that question
Sammy Woodard asked how to put yourself
out there more to make new friends just
attend events if your high school has
football games or basketball games or
maybe like parades you're simply gonna
attend those things I know they might
seem lame and people might tell you old
homecoming dance is lame because
everyone doesn't at my school if you sit
at home watching Netflix all the time
you're not gonna meet friends so don't
complain about not having friends when
you really didn't put yourself out there
you know so just do the activities I
know people might say they're stupid but
do them Sanjay Gonzalez asked how do you
stay focused and you think it's possible
to move up in your class your senior
year plus tips you do I would say I have
a very large class so for me my class
rank is pretty much set
and for the past two years it really
hasn't changed a lot besides like one or
two spots that's for me personally I
don't know if you have a smaller school
that would be easier to move up I know
my class is about 600 students so I'm
pretty much stuck where I'm at but I
like where I'm at so it's okay take AP
classes if you get those ten or five
extra points out it on daddy harder
asked for extra credit um I guess just
trying to move up that way those are the
questions I'm going to answer in this
video if you have any other questions I
will definitely be answering the
comments of this video a little more
than I usually do so just leave them
down below and I will try my best to
reply to you if I don't please don't be
mad at me also like this video if you
are going to be a freshman next year I
would love to see all my fishies like
this video and if you're in the mood for
watching some more back to school videos
I have a lot linked down below and I
also just did one about 15 things you
need for back-to-school so definitely
check that one out and my other ones and
I'll see you guys my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
