what happened to my face how did this
even happen Oh
to avoid this in high school I'm going
to be showing you guys two different
makeup tutorials that are basic and
simple for everyday in high school so
look one is very simple more for every
day so I'm taking my natural skin
putting my hair back taking my Garnier
rollerball and I'm playing this
underneath my eyes to de-puff my eyes
and also give a little bit of coverage
now I'm taking my Maybelline anti aging
concealer and apply this to any problem
spots and blemishes that I may have on
my face
now taking my Rimmel stay matte powder
I'm going to be applying this to my face
and setting everything so it stays all
day throughout school and then taking my
ELF cream blush I am applying this to my
cheeks to give my skin a little glow and
make us look less dead so that's it for
face and out onto eyes so all I'm doing
is lining my eyes with my ELF cream
eyeliner and I'm just doing a very thin
line and then I'm just going to be
curling my eyelashes and applying my
favorite mascara right now which is the
Maybelline one by one
so for lips I'm taking my clinic almost
lipstick and flirty honey to moisturize
my lips and also provide a little bit of
tint so that is it for look number one
and yeah so look number two is a little
more done up maybe for picture day or
just when you feel like looking more put
together foundation can be a little too
cakey and heavier least for me for
highschool so I would make you my own
tinted moisturizer with my favorite
moisturizer and Foundation so using my
Revlon nearly naked foundation and
Clinique moisturizer I'm mixing these on
the back of my hand until I like the
consistency is good and applying it to
my face now I'm just blending it all in
and then I'm taking the same concealer
as before and applying this under my
eyes and again to any blemishes I may
have
and then again I am just setting
everything so like I said it stays on
all throughout the day and doesn't fade
so I'm going to be using powder blush
this is the bh cosmetics blush palette
and I'm applying a peachy color to my
cheeks to give my skin a little bit of a
healthy glow so then I'm going to be
filling in my eyebrows with my ELF
eyebrow gel just to frame my face and
overall just make them look nicer now
taking my Urban Decay primer potion I'm
going to apply this to my eyes this is
the one in Eden by the way and now just
so our eyeshadow stays and doesn't fade
and now you see my Maybelline Color
tattoo and barely branded I am applying
this to my lids to give our eyes a
little bit of a champagne base so I'm
going to be using my Sela in the light
palette and using Khitan and applying
this to my eyelids then taking kind of a
light brown I am putting this in the
crease to define our eyes a little more
and then taking a dark brown color I
just happened to mix these two and I am
applying this to the outer corner of my
eye and then taking kind of a light
vanilla color I am just applying this
under my brows as a highlight so then
I'm just lining my eyes with my Stila
eyeliner and Ansell just a nice brown
and then yet again I am curling my
eyelashes and applying my mascara to my
eyelashes for lips I'm taking my buxom
lipstick and nudist
I like this nude lipstick because it has
a pink undertone so it's not gonna make
me look at dead or anything so I'm just
applying this to my lips
and that is it for both of the looks for
high school I think they're very pretty
and good and age-appropriate that's
better hope you guys enjoyed this in
liked this video if you did and I'll see
you guys my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
