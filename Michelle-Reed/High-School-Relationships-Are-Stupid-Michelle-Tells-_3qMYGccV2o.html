video which is basically just my advice
videos I did these a long time ago and
that was the title of them a while back
but I haven't really done one in a while
so I decided that I would sit down and
just film this for you guys also I did
my little braided hairstyle but it kind
of looks like a helmet and I don't
really know how that happened so we're
just gonna leave the judgment elsewhere
I know I look like I'm wearing a helmet
a helmet we'd like to be featured in one
of these videos I asked for questions on
my Instagram so you should definitely
follow the bears so you can be in my
next one because like I said I want to
start doing these more frequently and
with all that being said we're just
gonna go ahead and get into the video
Lily said Earl asked how to not focus on
the little things in life
now I actually love the little things in
life I think they make life better I
actually literally have a sign that says
enjoy the little things in life but
someday you will realize they were big
things but I guess you're asking like
how to not let little things affect you
or make you angry that go wrong that's
my guess I see little things that make
me angry as little tests almost like
Michelle can this really bother you so
much that it ruins your day and I kind
of see it as kind of a challenge like
you shouldn't let those things affect
your mood in your overall day because
they're just little things that are
there to make you angry and testing
Kathryn Royer asks how do you hold such
a strong relationship in high school I
no longer you could say that high school
relationships are stupid and they're not
going to last in their pointless and
that's a valid point if you want to
believe that you can but for me
personally the relationship that I am is
a good one and it's a mature one and I
know it's not just some flaky high
school relationship that people kind of
stereotype than that and it's different
and it feels right for me and so I think
it's fine and I think if you find
someone in high school that you really
know like this is different then that's
good
I don't really know it just kind of
works and that's really all I have to
say about that a bo X asked advice on
being less awkward around people if
you're meeting someone for the first
time they're gonna be a little awkward
too it's just a natural thing that
happens and just face it no one's gonna
be judging you and don't think that
everyone's looking at every single move
that you make too
like if you're being weird or something
just kind of embrace it take a deep
breath and accept that you know
everyone's feeling the awkward tension
and you're not alone
Melanie Abbott asked how to look at
yourself in a positive way instead of
constantly comparing yourself to others
now I really am happy that you asked
this question because personally this is
something that I have dealt with a lot
for me it's not really based on looks
but it's more on Talent especially being
here on YouTube and there's such amazing
youtubers I compare myself to all of
them and I'm like she's so much better
than me he's so much better than me why
am I not as good as them and you can't
do that because I can tell you it's
really gonna halt who you are and your
talent if you're certainly more at the
looks aspect of it I can tell you that
you just gotta accept that you're your
own person and you are not created to
look like someone else you weren't
created to be Victoria's Secret model or
a brand new mobile model or the girl
walking next to you on the street you
know you're your own person and I can
promise that so many people are gonna
love you for you and that you just got
to be happy with yourself and not
compare yourself to other people because
it's only gonna bring you down first
Tyler asked how long did it take for you
to get big on YouTube it seems like the
process is so slow and I will say that
it is a slow process for me personally I
don't think I'm big I actually think I'm
a pretty slow burner here on YouTube
just because I have other things in my
life that I like to do you got to be
patient it took me a good probably like
three years to get rayon right now
so you got to be patient and you got to
be diligent and I think that's where
actually loving it comes into play
because if you're just doing YouTube to
get big or to make money it's not gonna
last because it's a process and it is
difficult and you got to really love it
to keep going with it
ATL 14 asks how do you keep acne away
now I'm actually going to be doing a
whole entire video on this in August
because for the past few months I've
actually been on accutane which I know a
lot of people have a lot of opinions on
and don't really want to like discuss it
right now and just because I wasn't
really gonna mention it but it will be
up in August and I'm gonna be talking
about all about how I'm clearing my skin
up right now I know my skin's not
perfect but it's a lot better than it
used to be so yeah I will just let you
know when that's up and you should
definitely look out Madison Marie asked
advice on how to stop eating so much I
love you I love you too and I'm assuming
on this question you're not saying that
you're starving yourself and you're
trying to eat less than a healthy amount
because I don't support that I think you
should eat until you're full and that's
the best way to go but for me something
I have a problem with is bored eating
because in the summer I can get really
bored and sometimes I just eat because
I'm bored which is bad so I guess the
best advice I'd have to give you is to
keep busy and just try not to think
about it it's something to do and just
do it for a long period of time and that
seems to help me pursue J Carly asks
feeling comfortable in your body when
you're in a bikini in front of guys and
friends just think I look good in this
bikini and I am rocking it like feed
yourself little thoughts and I promise
you'll start to feel better also don't
feel like you have to wear a bikini I
know for me personally I'm kind of
starting to get more into one-pieces
because they're a lot more comfortable
and they just make me feel better
personally so you don't have to wear
bikini if you don't feel comfortable in
one you can always just wear one-piece
because that's what I do sometimes raise
your fists lawyer asks I'm going to be a
junior next year any advice now I know a
lot of people say that junior is so bad
and like you have so much work and I
guess that's a little bit true I think
you do have a little more work than you
did your sophomore year but honestly
it's not as bad as people make it out to
be I think just do your studies and keep
up with it you know study for your SAT
and you're a CT because you won't be
like me and having to take
next year because I really don't want to
take it as a senior but I know I will
have to take them again I was a little
late on that and I didn't really like
hit the ground running with my SAT in my
ECT so just really focus on those a lot
focus on your schoolwork and you'll have
a good year I promise it's not as bad as
pica stick bug 1:06 how can I not be so
hard on myself with grades and such and
girl let me tell you I have dealt with
this a lot because I am my biggest
critic but I can tell you nobody is
perfect and how weird would that be if
everyone was perfect like honestly we
would have no one to laugh at you could
never laugh at yourself when you mess up
and it would just be so boring you just
gotta accept I'm not perfect I'm never
gonna be so I need to be happy whenever
I grow and I improve who's got accept
you're gonna mess up sometimes and
there's actually a quote by Winston
Churchill that someone showed me a few
days ago and it says success is the
ability to go from failure to failure
without losing your enthusiasm so just
accept you know failure makes me better
if I get a B or a C on something it's
not the end of the world I can grow and
learn from it so I think those are all
the questions that I'm going to answer
today I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video and got to chat with me a
little bit also I am creating a really
awesome quote wall on this wall right
here this blank so if you have any
favorite quotes share them down below
with like the creator of the quote was I
want to have that as well because I'm
really excited just to have a bunch of
like really positive inspiring things up
on my wall because when I wake up in the
morning it's the first thing that I see
I'll just read all these quotes and I
think it's gonna be really cool give
this video a like if you want more
advice videos in the future because I
like filming them and I really want
