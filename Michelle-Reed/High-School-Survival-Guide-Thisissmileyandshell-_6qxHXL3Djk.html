I'm going to be doing my high school
survival guide because I know if you're
watching this you're most likely a
freshman or soon-to-be freshman who's a
little bit scared about high school so
today I'm here just to semi try to ease
your nerves and give you guys my best
tips I will be a junior in high school
next year so I figured that two years of
high school has given me the ability to
be able to film this video for you guys
make sure to give this video a like if
you are going to be in high school next
year
and you really don't like school because
I don't like school so I really really
hate long intro so we're gonna go ahead
and get into this
first impressions are how people are
going to judge you for the rest of the
years you want to make sure that on the
first day of school you be yourself you
don't try to be somebody you're not and
you're open I think it's really
important to be friendly don't be too
close-minded don't give dirty looks to
be who you think are ugly or anything
just be yourself and be friendly and I'm
sure that you will make friends and give
a very good first impression I know most
schools have orientation days and you
can go around and figure out where your
schools are at and I think that's a
great time to figure out where each
class is it kind of map out your path so
you don't get lost but if you do get
lost don't be afraid to ask someone
where to go because that is a great way
to make friends whether it's a teacher
or a person and it also made you know a
cute boy or something so don't be afraid
to ask for directions I know this is so
cliche and you guys are like oh my gosh
for Sheldon to join clubs I think clubs
I joined my school's dance team or drill
team and I meant so many people and that
way I went into school knowing girls and
knowing people and I wasn't so shy and
awkward I don't think had a person who's
great at just walking up to somebody and
talking to them so clubs it was really
really good for me because you're kind
of forced to meet people nobody meant
that they're gonna like throw the
freshmen in trash cans and like eat
their brains and stuff that's not true
upperclassmen are not mean you just have
to respect them and they'll respect you
and it will be a great circle of life I
know that there are kids who think that
they don't have to study because they
can t get us and a sit-in octa city and
life is just great but you go to college
you're gonna have to study so I think
it's important to develop a good study
plan around high school actually have a
whole video about this already up so
make sure to go check that out if you're
more worried about the study of grades
aspect
I know that there are schools that offer
kind of honors classes or AP classes and
that is a way to get college credit
while you're in high school now these
classes are hard and if you don't think
you can take them don't take that but if
you're willing to accept the challenge
and work a little bit harder I think
these are great classes to take I took
my first one last year the AP World
History one and I worked my butt off in
that class and I took the exam didn't
think I was gonna pass and I ended up
getting the college credit so definitely
definitely take these classes if you
think you can because there's such a
great way to get college credit if you
are doing a lot of sports a lot of
outside activities maybe these higher
classes aren't really for you unless
you're up for the challenge I think high
school should be a good experience and
you don't want to be the kid who's just
drowning and like self-pity because
they're having the worst time of their
lives in high school don't be that kid
put it up on your plate to where you
feel happy but not to the point where
you're stressed and you get anxiety and
every night's just you sitting up to a
four because you have so much stuff to
do in high school you're gonna get some
bad grades you're gonna get some
mediocre grades and it's not the end of
the world if you're like me you're
probably super conscientious about I
even say that word right grades and all
that and I just kind of had to accept
the fact that I'm not going to get
perfect grades and it's not the world
the cool kids really aren't that cool
and hang out with people that you love
and you enjoy not because they're
popular and that you want to be higher
up in the high school hierarchy and
hoping that some of this somewhere else
I was looking at advice online and
someone said people are most likely
caring more about what they're wearing
than what you're wearing which is so so
true like can I get an amen
don't stand in front of your mirror
hours upon hours trying to pick out an
outfit because most likely people aren't
even going to notice that if we're being
completely honest if you enjoy wearing
really nice outfits every day because it
makes you feel confident wear those
things and don't let people tell you
what to do I know going from middle
school to high school you'll probably
lose a lot of your middle school friends
I basically lost all my middle school
friends so it's great but honestly two
years later I am perfectly fine and I
met so many better friends so if you do
lose your best friend in middle school
do not cry about it just accept it with
open arms and be willing to meet other
people also people say things about you
in high school
don't take them to heart usually if the
kids who are still up early going
through puberty and they're stupid and
they don't know what they're saying so
just ignore them and know that you're
beautiful and you're awesome and
people's words should not affect you
you're only young once and I think high
school should be a good experience it's
something that I'm kind of learning to
do is just enjoy high school more and
not be such a pessimistic teenager
because it's just life and life should
not be that hard so that it's all of the
advice that I have for you guys let me
know if you're a freshman or a
soon-to-be freshman next year because I
would really like to know also let me
know what other back to school videos
you'd like to see because as you can
tell I'm kind of getting the ball
rolling on the back to school videos and
I would always like to have some more
requests from you guys I love you guys
so much and I'll see you guys my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
