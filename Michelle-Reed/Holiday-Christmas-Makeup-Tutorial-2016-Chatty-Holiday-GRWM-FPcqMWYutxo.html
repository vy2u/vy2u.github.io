just me jump down my eyes I'm so excited
for this video because of one it's my
first holiday video I'm pretty sure
today I'm gonna be doing this look it's
a very pretty holiday inspired luck with
red lips and gold eyes perfect for the
Christmas time and also I am back home
this weekend for Thanksgiving and so I'm
back in my normal setting I'm feeling it
I'm so excited that I'm also
chit-chatting with you guys because
wouldn't even be one of my makeup
tutorials if I didn't talk to you guys
so if you're new subscribe I upload once
a week and it's Christmas time spread
the holiday cheer let's just go ahead
and get right into the video so to start
off like always I'm using might be no
positively radiant moisturizer best
moisturizer ever so weird that I'm in
this room right now I haven't been home
in like three months
and I'm sitting in my normal room and
I'm doing my makeup and it just feels so
so cool I absolutely love the city but
coming home has been so nice this past
week it's just seeing my family and
being in Texas and not like having all
the noise and the crazy commotion it's
just so good for my soul or foundation
I'm using my clinic beyond perfecting
foundation plus concealer this is the
best foundation ever guys if you like a
pretty flawless finish to your
foundation and you don't want to look
super cakey this is so perfect
my sister actually got married to this
weekend by the time you're watching this
you would have already seen the video
which you should have like a watch it
was such a fun video I loved doing
weekend in my life videos but she also
got married and it was just so awesome
getting to be there with her I have a
sister getting married before so it was
so so cool then just concealing my eyes
with my instant age rewind concealer I
don't use primarily eyes so I honestly
don't feel like it does anything then
I'm just sitting it with a little bit of
pressed powder her eyes I'm keeping it
classic with my Urban Decay Naked
palette I'm gonna use all kind of the
face I shadows from this something off
by just using the color naked in my
crease because I think it's the perfect
crease color you're going forward kind
of a very warm gold look today I'm not
taking the shade buck right here I'm
applying this in my outer corner
and then taking the shade half-baked
which is a gold color I'm applying this
to my lid so now I'm just taking the
shades smog and dark horse' I'm applying
those in my outer corner and for the fun
part
I'm taking my steel eyeshadow in the
shade Comics copper it's a really pretty
gold copper color I think you can't have
the holidays without a little bit of
shimmer so we're gonna apply this over
top of that gold eyeshadow as you can
see it's definitely like a very messy
glittery look but I think that's really
pretty for the holidays
and then just going under my brow bone
with some of a clean eye shadow I'm
gonna apply this under my brows to kind
of brighten up the look a little bit
then i'm using my wing black eyeliner
from the balm and I'm just doing a line
of eyeliner on my top lashes I'm using
my Naked palette I'm going to take that
eyeshadow buck again I'm gonna play this
on my lower lash line so I'd only be
gonna concealer just cuz I shadow has a
lot of fallout i hadn´t using my
instant age rewind concealer I'm gonna
be baking this so I'm just gonna put it
in a triangle formation and then blend
it in it so someone asked on instagram
what the hardest part about growing up
has been I don't mean to make this super
deep but I thought this is a good
questions I'm gonna go ahead and answer
it I guess I'm short learning how to
balance being an adult with being a kid
because I feel like in life it's good to
constantly need curious about life and
about the world and kind of be like a
kid and not sense and that you never
lose like the wonder of the world that
my god is created at the same time you
do have to grow up and you do have to
gain responsibilities that you didn't
used to have and so for me the hardest
part has just been balancing like okay
yeah I'm 18 yeah I'm in college yeah I
live alone in New York City but at the
same time like I still want to be a kid
in the sense that I'm like it's really
cool that I live in the city and it's
beautiful and I want to be happy and
curious about it and a kid in that kind
of sense I know where you're gonna bake
this with the laura mercier translucent
powder this stuff is so expensive but it
is so worth it it gives the most
beautiful finish to my foundation and my
concealer on highly
and then I'm just setting the rest of my
face powder very very lightly so I'm
gonna keep this look very glowy and
fresh I want to make this whole video
just about me moving to New York and
stuff but someone asked about my biggest
adjustment was the hardest I'm also
setting my brows with monkey Negro from
Venice but not having complete a long
time there's always someone in my
apartment because I have a roommate who
I love more and it's the best I'm not
hating on our I'm just saying if you go
to study in the library or like a coffee
shop there's always people there there's
always people in the streets there's
always people in the park there's just
like you never truly have like a long
time that say you would have in your
room back home and I guess that's been
the hardest for me I'm then just
brushing away all the excess powder real
so for bronzer I'm using my Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer I think that
this bronzer is absolutely incredible it
rocks and it's gonna contour my
cheekbones with this I use the hoola
bronzer a lot but recently I've kind of
switched over to this one and I just
think it's the best I've also been
having a dilemma because tomorrow's
Black Friday but something about me
recently is I have not been into
spending money I don't know if it's just
because it's College and I'm more money
conscious but like I can't bring myself
to go out and shop on Black Friday why I
just feel like it almost space in my
apartment for anything that's like
something I've been having trouble with
YouTube lately because like YouTube is
so so consumer-driven it's like whole
videos and make up stories and buy this
buy that yeah I haven't wanted to put up
like haul videos and thinks about
spending money because I like I just
don't like doing it so actually I asked
you guys if you have any ideas for
videos that aren't like haul videos or
makeup tutorials or things like showing
stuff that I bought let me know down
below I've been trying to do more like
weekend in my life videos vlogs because
I definitely want to kind of change my
message to enjoying live being fully
present and saving your money for things
that are bigger in life because right
now I'm thinking about after college
that I want to get married and I want to
have kids and so I've been saving money
I know this is really deep but I just
like being honest with you guys
Prakash I'm using my Milani baked blush
in the shade Rose door or oh it's like a
really pretty Goldy pink color I know
I've been putting up a lot of like vlogs
and weekend of my life videos and
something if you guys enjoy those are
not my graduation one and my prom one
and the past weekend in my life when I
did like I know those are all videos I'm
gonna watch like in five years it was so
much then I'm just finishing off with
mascara I'm using my rocket mascara
obviously you can use fake eyelashes but
I know a lot of you guys are younger and
you're probably doing family events I
just don't think for everyone like fake
eyelashes are completely necessary so
I'm just using good ol mascara
and lastly guys I'm going with classic
red lips this is in the shade Oh - it's
by Clinique it's like a red color so I
really hope you guys enjoyed watching
this video I had so much fun filming it
for you guys I'm in the best mood I'm
home it's Christmas time I'm feeling it
yeah way I hope you guys enjoy this look
let me know if you recreate it you
should also go watch my last video links
right here along with all my other
social medias give this video a like let
me know how you're doing down below I
love you all so much I'll see you guys
