all about holiday gifts and what to ask
for for Christmas what you should get
other people and all that good stuff
this is the cooperation with Yoona days
which is the coolest website because if
you're in college basically what the
site does is it offers you student
discounts on online shopping which I
know a lot of us love to do it reach out
to me I thought it'd be such a cool
opportunity because as you can see I'm
in college I'm filmin I'm a dorm and so
I just thought this to be applicable to
a lot of you guys I also try to make
these gifts range and prices and so some
are on the lower end some are on the
higher end so no matter what you're
getting someone you definitely have a
bunch of different options and I have
ten gifts total as always if you're new
you should definitely subscribe I'm
going to be back home soon and so I'm
gonna be filmmaking a ton so you should
definitely hit that button I will be
back to twice a week uploads I'll just
go ahead and get into the video
oh the gifts I'm showing you guys in
this video are from you today's which is
basically a website that you sign up and
you put in your student discount
information and where you go to college
and basically whatever you online shop
it will give you an automatic discount
on certain things so you'll get a code
to enter and you can get like 15 to 20
percent off depending on what the
website is free service so you don't
even have to pay for anything and it's
also super easy to use they have so many
different websites they have like Mon
cloth and a sauce and misguided and
Levi's just basically all brands that
you know of and that you shop a lot on
my personal favorite that they have is
ModCloth I love I'll have all the links
to unities down below if you want to
check it out it's easy literally put a
new student information and you get
discount so it's really cool there no
gimmicks so the saying right here is
from ModCloth basically it is a cactus
jewelry stand holder this is the coolest
gift ever and I feel like this is
definitely something that even if you
have someone who has everything they
probably don't have a cactus jewelry
holder this is super duper cute it was
on sale on ModCloth and I got it really
really discounted and it actually has
been sitting in my dorm room over there
so if you want to get someone something
nice but not anything too expensive and
you can't afford to buy jewelry I think
that this item is super great basically
these are the wild fox jumpers which if
you know anything about wild fox they're
super duper expensive I need all hours
which is insane and I just think it's
something that you wouldn't necessarily
buy yourself as a Christmas gift this is
so so nice this one is
a baby pink one with roses on it
basically I haven't lounging around my
dorm room wearing this like all the time
I roommate Lauren could definitely vouch
should I wear this basically every day
since I got it because it's so comfy a
really good pair of boots I have to to
show you guys they're very very
different but I think they're both super
cute first pair is from ModCloth and I
got these really really on sale and they
were discounted from the UT day's
discount and so they look like this
they're just maroon and orange and suede
and they're super high and cute I love
these is they're just a pair of shoes
and I feel like you wouldn't want to buy
yourself because they're kind of crazy
they're kind of out there but as a gift
I think they're so great to receive this
next pair is kind of the same deal these
are patent leather black like pump boots
these are so cute he's from public
desire which I've never ordered from but
I saw on the unities website they're
like killer shoes her mate Lauren said
these look like spy shoes and I totally
agreed
my next gift idea would just be a very
nice pair of sunglasses sunglasses are
something that I just don't normally
like to spend money on myself because
they're expensive and they're not
something that you know I really feel
like splurging on I think just having
like a really nice pair of aviators or
whatever brand you like I think that
they are super cute these are the brand
Raven and they're just these silver lens
ones and so they're super simple they go
with everything
dutifully more expensive but if you're
asking for like one nice thing or it's
someone you're really close to I think
that sunglasses are really really good
like an easy thing to get if you're
someone who really likes makeup or you
know someone that's super into makeup I
think a really good eye shadow palette
is such an easy gift
this one is meet matrimony from the balm
it's what I'm wearing today it has such
pretty like warm and neutral colors if
you don't know which ones they prefer I
think this one is great it's matte it's
simple but the colors are really
pigmented and they're so pretty
I have two of my favorites right here
this first one is misty or sherry this
is such a classic scent it's so pretty
it's basically my go-to one I wear it
all the time it's really really light
and fresh a really
every day perfume but if you're someone
who likes more kind of deeper sense or
you know someone who does I think that
the I heart Juicy Couture one is so nice
I did an Instagram collaboration with
them and ever since then I've just loved
this perfume it's something more musky
and warm and a little just deeper o
perfume is always something that is oh
my gonna panting I think perfume is
definitely something that is a very safe
gift and everyone would enjoy getting I
know it's kind of stereotypical but I
would love to receive either these
they're both awesome if you know someone
who enjoys writing or just writing down
their thoughts and all that good stuff I
think that a journal is such a good gift
ModCloth actually has a ton of really
really cute one but this one is just the
one that I use it's just black but I
basically write in this like every day I
journal and write my thoughts and all
that good stuff and so I just think a
really nice journal is such a personal
yet easy gift it's something that I feel
like everyone would enjoy because you
always have something to write down a
matter where you're at I think that I
personally love is these little wall
arts decor things if you've ever seen my
dorm room you know I have a pretty big
gallery wall that just has my favorite
quotes sign this is one of my favorites
it is from a type Center on Instagram
she's so cool guys bob cloth actually
has a ton of cute wall decor if you're
looking for some I just think that these
are so so cute and so personal
especially if you get one with someone's
favorite quote rather inexpensive but
still something that someone would enjoy
a lot it's gonna be one of my videos
find it throw in some fashion and so I
have one of my favorite things ever and
that would be just really really big
denim jacket I actually asked my sister
Jamie what she wanted for Christmas and
she specifically said like thrifted
denim jackets so I have two here this
one is one that I were basically all the
time it has a corduroy little collar and
the sleeves are quarter then I also have
this oversized denim one that is kind of
like three sizes too big but Levi's
actually sells a ton of cute denim
jackets that look like they've been
thrifted which is also on you today so
I'll have them linked down below if you
want to check them out and my last thing
that I think is really really easy that
would just be really cute mugs I think
that mugs are awesome especially if you
know someone who collects them this one
is actually from a thrift shop called
Housing Works in New York City but I
just think these are
so so cute I know ModCloth has the
cutest like quirky items I know I keep
talking about them but they're really
awesome

show you guys I hope this gave you guys
