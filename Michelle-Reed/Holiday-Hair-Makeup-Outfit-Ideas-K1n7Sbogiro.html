holiday hair makeup and outfit videos so
you could use this for either Christmas
or Thanksgiving or any other holiday
party that you have to go to so I hope
you guys enjoy so first starting off
with makeup I am using my covergirl
whipped cream foundation to kind of give
a glowy look so you look nice and happy
for your holiday parties then I just
applied a cream concealer to my under
eyes and this huge zit that I happen to
have on my cheek and then I'm setting
everything with my stay matte powder
then I'm just filling in my brows with
my benefit I broke it just to kind of
define them because they were looking a
little bad and then I just applied my
kind of mavi colored blush from ELF as
an eyeshadow base I'm using this kind of
Bronte colored one and then i'm using
the lorac pro palette in taking a gold
color I'm applying this to the inner or
the outer two-thirds of my eye and then
we're going to take the bronze color and
put this in the kind of inner third and
the tear duct area then I'm putting
garne which is a nice kind of red color
all into the crease then I'm just
setting that gold color with a little
bit of a gold pigment to make it really
pop and then using deep purple I'm up
putting this in the outer corner of my
eye and then using champagne and nude
I'm putting this on the inner half of my
lower lash line and then using puter in
the outer half of my lash line
then we are just applying a little bit
of mascara and eyeliner and that is it's
for the eyes her lips I'm just
moisturizing and then applying this
berry color kind of wine colored
lipstick from clinic
supper hair the first look is very
simple in kind of classy so I just tease
the top part of my hair and then did
these very loose waves which I think
I've done a thousand times on camera but
I just used a wand and then held it for
a few seconds and then let go then I
hairspray the curls that kind of ran my
fingers through them so they weren't so
cruelly and then I just pinned up the
top part of my hair kind of the front
bangs area and teased it and that is it
it's super simple and super easy now
this next hairstyle is a little more
difficult it's that milkmaid kind of
bohemian up to so all you do is part
your hair into a middle part and then
take the two sections and pull out your
bangs or the front part of your hair and
then due to simple braids kind of loose
I think it looks better when the braids
are loose and then secure them with a
clear elastic then I just loosen the
braid so they looked better whenever
they were in the updo so then you just
pull your hair across the top and pin it
to pin it a lot if you have super thick
hair like me and that is basically it
just kind of pulls some pieces out
hairspray it re curl the front pieces
and that is it I think it's super
different but super duper pretty
you make so this first outfit is a
little more dressy I'm just wearing this
top and this super cute kind of fringe
skirt which are both from choice I will
link them down below and then my
necklace is from Francesca's it's super
pretty unique goes with absolutely
everything my kind of charcoal tights
are from j.crew and then my little
booties are from dsw now if this look is
too dressy for you which it probably
would be for me I'd recommend just
putting it with some black jeggings
minor from american eagle and then I
just paired it with this faux fur vest
from H&amp;amp;M which is so comfy and i love it
and i think it's very very appropriate
for any kind of holiday party that
you're going to make sure you watch my
last video which will be linked here
