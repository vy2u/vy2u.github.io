up in the morning is put on my super
comfy little booties and then I tried to
do this cute like jumping on my bed
thing but it actually took three takes
and it was a waste of five minutes of my
life so and then I always make my bed in
the morning and I just like to shed some
light on the fact that my room is so
Christmasy right now it is beautiful
then I head over to the bathroom because
I have to brush my teeth right as I wake
up or else I cannot stay on my nasty
brother this finger and then we go over
to the kitchen to grab some breakfast
because it is the most important meal of
the day and I mom happen to make my
favorite breakfast casserole and it was
delicious
after I eat I like to make myself a cup
of coffee and if you want to add a
little Christmassy twist just add a
little bit of your favorite hot cocoa
mix and it kind of makes it more of a
mocha and it tastes amazing so I love
doing this in the winter time then I
head over to my living room and get
comfy because I love to watch a vlog
miss on YouTube and my favorite wants to
watch are everything Emily more Molly
Anne and keeping up with Kenzie they're
all great and I'll eat them all down
below a humble tune melody and then I
decide that I should probably take a
shower and today I didn't actually wash
my hair that's why it's dry and I also
kept a shirt on because I thought it'd
be weird if I just walked on in the
straight-up towels so please ignore
those things then I go in my room and
turn on some music for whenever I'm
doing my makeup and I started off with
my Revlon concealer which is actually
almost out so leave your suggestions
down below because I'm looking for
anyone and then I just set this with my
Rimmel stay matte powder and apply a
little bit of Benetint for some color
then I fill in my eyebrows with my
Anastasia brow pencil which is honestly
amazing and I definitely recommend it to
you guys because the eyebrows are on
fleek with this I also did an eye shadow
look with one of my favorite palettes
and applied my rocket mascara to my
lashes and my favorite iOS lip balm
which is this little blue striped one I
don't remember the flavor but it rocks
and for hair I just did two day curls so
I put some hairspray in them so it looks
a little better but yeah I was just
really lazy today
and then whenever I actually have to put
on my outfit I get extremely distracted
so like this video if this ever happens
to you cuz it happens to me on the day
we my outfit today was super casual I
just had on this huge chunky sweater
that I got from Urban Outfitters my
jeggings were from American Eagle and
they're super duper comfy and then I
just paired it with my favorite choice
boots this little twig necklace is from
shop lately and I will have it linked
down below and yeah that's pretty much
it for my morning I just kind of hung
out with gunner for the rest of the day
and we actually filmed a video so look
out for that and yeah that's pretty much
it I'll see you guys my next video bye
