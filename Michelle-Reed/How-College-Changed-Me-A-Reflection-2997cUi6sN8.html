my first semester in college remember
that time you told yourself you make
really healthy meals since you don't
have a meal plan but I literally don't
have groceries right now and I don't
have any food yeah you'll actually
goldfish for sex for meals all the time
goldfish will always be the answer
you're going to get really close to the
subway you'll laugh on the subway you'll
cry on the subway will be really really
quiet on the subway and you'll be angry
on the subway closely just angry on the
subway there's really no such thing as
having your life together balancing
YouTube in school is a lot I think I've
been struggling to get it down why I
just like completely forgot feel like I
haven't blogged in such a long time it's
just been so busy anyone who says they
have it together they're really lying
you simply do life and that's all you do
we out here there just love when I look
at my school you can never justify a six
dollar cold brew iced coffee - stop
trying reading studying and writing
really good papers is actually really
cool so excited to read all the books
that I brought here dumb final I
couldn't be happier with my grade
learning is cool
so keep enjoying it so pay to be stupid
you're not an adult embrace being a kid
for as long as possible like this even
if that means lying down in the street
at 2:00 a.m. in Brooklyn you're not
going to be able to do it forever that
really awesome skyline view will
probably be better if you just keep it
to yourself you do not need a posted on
Instagram 50 times people get an enjoy
moment for yourself keep some things
private because they're more important
and they're more special that way you
have to keep being vulnerable with
people to make actual friendship every
time I talk about you I just start
laughing
otherwise it won't happen but at the
same time do not trust anybody yes
Michelle people are really really nice
but it may just be that they're really
really nice or in your heart in a
healthy manner that's good for you but
not too much is good outside of your
comfort zone
like 232 things that scare you a good
scare is good for your body is good for
your soul and you'll be a lot happier
this way coming I kind of got so awesome
is it much that a really nice hot shower
listening to you how to bad day and a
good cry campus live a life full of
Thanksgiving I love near city you can
definitely be my whole entire day so
happy I have Rose here a makeover the
security guard that made sure you had a
jacket before you got out no little kid
on the subway that laughed and smiled at
you and make your morning before you
went to class for the surprising a that
you got on that paper that you did not
expect always always always be grateful
because these things are blessings ah so
pretty outside they're given by God so
don't take them for granted write down
everything your thoughts what you're
feeling no matter how small big
pointless or important they may be write
down everything it is good for you and
it's going to help you in the long run
don't buy that $15.00 fancy cheese to
show your friends what real Texas queso
it tastes like it will get chunky and
you will burn it you're not your mom you
can't cook like your mom do you buy that
$7.00 bus ticket to sonic in New Jersey
because that will be one of the funnest
moments ever
we're currently going to New Jersey on a
blood oxygen and even if they seem
stupid the stupid things are usually the
most fun okay to say no and you have to
do it to survive doing the most does not
equal being the most successful you can
only be better than you were yesterday
I'm really does heal all wounds and some
things you just have to let and I'll
always have to be doing something it's
okay just to sit guys so whether that be
in a part on a bench on the roof on a
desk in your bed sometimes it's good
just to sit your still not too old or
too good for publicly listening to
Justin Bieber at love yourself anyone
and you're still not too good for Jesus
you need use us the most of all you will
always be Jesus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
