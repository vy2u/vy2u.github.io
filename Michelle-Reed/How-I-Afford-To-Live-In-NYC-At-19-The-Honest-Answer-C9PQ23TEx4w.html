this is something that I have never
really done but I'm really looking
forward to living in New York City one
of the biggest things that was a factor
of whether I was gonna be able to go was
finances New York City is a very
expensive place and I'm just gonna be
honest it has the capability to drain
your bank account and so I wanted to put
together a video how I afford to live
here at 19 with just general tips on
saving money and college and also saving
money in high school so you can do the
things that you want to also I'm having
a no makeup day so if you're like
Michelle you're not wearing makeup I'm
like yeah I would encourage you to do it
to just like let your skin breathe and
so I was gonna put on makeup to film
this but I was like that's kind of
stupid I just want to thank my friends
over at credit Sesame for sponsoring
this video credit is important and I
thought that this was the perfect
integration for this video and sponsored
video if you don't like it you can click
out of this video first tip would be to
start saving at a young age if you're
watching this and you are 13 14 15 start
saving your money now high school you
most likely don't have a ton of things
to pay for you probably have like your
food covered your housing you have like
sometimes your gas paid for it so this
is the perfect time to start saving
money and I saved most of my money in
high school tically I started working
whenever I was 14 doing youtube and so I
would literally set aside 50% of my
paychecks and then I would have like
taxes and then I would also have
discretionary money after that then I
would keep that as one of the main
reasons why I'm able to live here is
because I started that habit really
young obviously now I pay for a lot more
things so saving like fifty percent of
my income isn't necessarily like typical
but start small at like ten percent of
what you're making twenty percent of
what you're making and setting it aside
my second tip if you're in college I
would recommend not buying new textbooks
you probably already know this but
textbooks can be so expensive guys they
can literally be like $200 for a
textbook especially if you're in like a
medical field they can be so expensive
guys my school actually has a website
where kids who go to my school will sell
their textbook so I usually do it
through that check is a website you can
do honestly Amazon has a used
section whenever you go to buy a book if
you click like the use just because
textbooks can rack up so much of your
money and I know that's probably
something most kids have to spend their
own money on so do that it helps my
third tip would be to start developing
good credit credit is a scary thing I'm
just gonna be honest it terrifies me and
so when I heard about credit Sesame I
thought it was super cool if this is a
website that kind of takes the fear out
of credit and just helps you financially
plan it's not there to like improve your
credit score but it is there to give you
a credit score report card kind of like
a holistic view of what your credit
score is and help you be the best
possible but it's not gonna make you
have a good credit score I love using it
for financial help because being my teen
these are things they're things that
seem very far off but they're actually
very immediately I'm getting an
apartment next year and that is
something where you have to have like a
good credit score to be able to be
approved especially here in New York
City I thought credit Sesame was the
perfect website I started using it as
soon as I thought about like having my
own apartment it's really easy to use
the website I'll have it linked down
below she has a ton of different
financial services and you don't have to
pay for it either it's a free service do
you have a membership that you can pay
for but you don't even need a credit
card to use it you can just start using
the website as soon as possible then get
free IV protection for up to $50,000
which is also really good I personally
like because it shows your financial
potential which i think is really
important whenever you are picking where
you want to go to school for college
because if you are paying for college
you want to make sure this is something
that is not going to hurt your financial
future that's not gonna put you in a bad
place also checking your credit score
isn't going to hurt it wellhow credits
us meet link down below if you want to
check it out it'll be like the first
link in the description but I definitely
think credit is important number for you
guys know I am super into buying
groceries I think that grocery shopping
is great definitely try to limit how
much I eat out if you're in college and
like all your friends are going out to
eat eat your own food bring your own
food because eating out can just like
totally wreck your saving number five
it's also kind of Briana but take public
transit obviously I live in New York so
I only take the subway which is not the
most efficient system but if you don't
have to pay for gas you can actually
save a lot of money if you don't want to
pay
car insurance taking the bus and a lot
of colleges have like a bus transit
system and other cities do to take it my
monthly subway card is around 121
dollars a month but compare that to like
gas prices and insurance and having to
keep up with a car it's so much cheaper
for the most part it works there are
times when the MTA is slow and there are
a ton of delays but for the majority of
the time I save a lot of money using
public transit number six is something
that I don't really struggle with but
it's something that could really spend a
lot of money stop binge drinking and
stop smoking those are two things that
this may be sensitive to say but they're
really expensive and if you're in
college and you're taking in those two
activities like it can be really
expensive and add up especially alcohol
like you wasted all of that money on
alcohol like how sad would you be I'm
not trying to tell anyone how to stop
their addictions but not keeping things
in your apartment and your house really
helps you not partake in them using
student discounts is another big tip I
am personally a made well fanatic I love
made well and I recently found out that
they have student discounts a 15% so I
will literally only shop at places where
I can use student discount I don't shop
all that much I honestly wear a lot of
the same clothes I don't buy a ton of
clothes I'm really not like a super
spendy person when it comes to clothes
number eight it's to make your own
coffee I would recommend getting a
French press and it tastes so much
better than like coffee you go out and
buy you will save so much money you just
think about how much like a latte is
four to five dollars if you buy that
every single day and this is one of the
hardest things for me because I love
coffee my next tip would be two very
good jobs that you have and you can make
money by doing different things whether
that be having like a part-time job and
a full-time job whether that be like
doing your own freelance work while like
having a job on the other side this is a
good way to save money with YouTube I
don't make money all through like my
views I don't make money all through
sponsorships it's varied and I find that
that has allowed me to save more so I
can like pick and choose in terms of how
much money I want to make my last tip
would be in high school
make sure you're taking AP credits or
college credits I've got a year off of
school by doing AP credits and then
being accepted at Kings the school I'm
at right now and if you do that that's a
great way to save money I was able to
come to school here because I didn't get
those credits and so it was cheaper to
come here and live in New York City and
then go to school back home and be there
for four years I'm not a financial
expert I'm literally just 19 and these
are the tips that work for me so if they
don't work for you please don't go shred
me in the comments like being
financially stable is really important
and I feel like we don't really talk
about this a lot especially to college
students and so I really hope this gives
you guys a couple of tips if you have
any other questions leave them down
below if someone else leaves a question
feel free to answer it because we should
all help each other in this video I love
going to the comments and seeing like
everyone helping each other out
it literally warms my heart make sure to
go watch my last video I love you guys
and I'll see you soon don't forget to
check out credit Sesame link down below
