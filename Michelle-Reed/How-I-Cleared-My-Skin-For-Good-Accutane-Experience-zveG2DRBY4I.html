video all about how I cleared up my skin
with accutane also this is not my normal
background I'm in my sister's room
because they are currently fixing our AC
and it's really loud by arm so I try to
like string some lights and bring some
of my personality in here but it's not
the cutest so I'm sorry basically a lot
of you guys noticed that my skin was
clearing up and I think a lot of people
wanted to know how I did it and so I
wanted to do a whole video about my
experience with accutane because I'm
cute Ain is a very harsh intense drug
and it's kind of a last result for a lot
of people and I know a lot of people
want to know like experiences with it
and how it works and so I figured I'd do
this video basically accutane is the
only medication that actually stops acne
all the other ones suppressed AK mean so
it's very intense it's not something you
go on immediately you do have to be
approved by a dermatologist I'll have
more about the actual drug down below if
you've never heard about it I will find
a link that kind of describes it so part
1 of this video is going to be about why
I went on accutane what my acne was like
to is going to be all about my
experience the side effects I
encountered and then three is going to
be what I think if I would recommend it
and all that stuff I'm going to have a
whole skincare routine at the end of
this so you can watch that to know what
products I use on accutane basically my
acne before I went on accutane I never
had severe cystic acne however I did get
like a cystic pimple here that would
stay for a month and it would stain and
it was frustrating because nothing would
work I also had a lot of acne on my back
which a lot of people don't like to talk
about because it's weird it's gross
whatever I dance I sweat a lot and so my
back really did get bad acne and so that
was the main reason why I went on
accutane because all the other stuff
that I tried wasn't working for my back
I also had a little bit of acne on my
legs which again is kind of gross to
talk about but yeah that was there and I
just honestly I was tired of taking
medication and topical treatments at
work treatments treatments that weren't
working and so I decided to go on
accutane I'm still on it right now I
have a
left and so I'm still going I know
that's kind of bad I'm not filming this
like after the whole thing is done so I
apologize for that but I just felt like
my skin is to the point where I can talk
about it because I'm happy with it so I
started on 40 milligrams and that is
what I'm still on right now but since my
acne was never horrible I never really
needed to up my dosage I just continued
on the same one for the duration that I
was on accutane next part of this is the
side effects and my experience so when I
went on accutane I started in March like
I said and symptoms that I encountered
were one dryness dryness is something
that you're going to get if you're on
accutane it's like inevitable my lips
got really bad that's probably the worst
part of it is my lips for dry and
cracked and they just we're not cute but
I just use aquaphor and that fixed that
also you have dryness on your face and
your body I had a lot of dryness here on
my elbows and then around my like chin
area
I got like patches of dryness but
honestly I just fixed that with lotion
and fixed everything to was nosebleeds I
got a ton of nosebleeds I am a person
who already gets nosebleeds frequently
and so I've heard that people who get
nosebleeds a lot tend to get more on
accutane but if you don't get nosebleeds
a lot you probably won't get them so if
I remember when I went to New York like
a month into accutane I got like 5
nosebleeds there and it was awful I
actually bled all over a blazer I was
about to buy at H&amp;amp;M fun story so I know
Swedes were not fun but I did get those
pretty frequently and then three the
last thing was joint paint I've never
been the kind of person that complains
at all joint pain you know feeling all
my back my leg my arm and it's so
annoying I'm like come on let's just
tough it out it's gonna be okay
but honestly my lower back did hurt
pretty good deal um going to sleep it
hurt a lot and then I am a dancer and so
like stretching and doing like dancey
stuff that hurt too those are really the
only side effects that I had I only had
three I know there's a long list of side
effects which I will list right here so
there's definitely a lot I didn't really
experience like nausea or depression
depression is a big one that a lot of
we'll get also if you are a girl you do
have to take a pregnancy test before
going on accutane and you have to do
blood tests and you have to do quizzes
over like birth control and stuff do you
are in a queue team there's a great
chance that your baby can have birth
defects if you become pregnant and so
you really have to abstain from getting
pregnant is I don't know it's just it's
very intense in that way too you do have
to do blood tests every month you have
to visit the dermatologist every month
so it's a lot to keep up with I will
admit it was kind of frustrating always
having to make those appointments stay
on them their times it's kind of
stressful but here for part three I
would say accutane was awesome my skin
has not been this good ever like ever in
my life my skin has not been this clear
I can go out without having makeup on
and feel great
my skin is glowy and smooth all glowy
after I put moisturizer on because it's
pretty dry right now but skin is
something that I have a big insecurity
with and it's one of the main things on
my body that I really like to work on
like my hair I mean whatever my makeup
whatever my body whatever but my skin is
really important to me and so I'm just
so happy with it I'm so happy to have
clear skin and if any of you guys are
struggling with severe acne or just
annoying acne that really brings down
your happiness I would definitely
recommend trying out accutane it is not
for everyone but you can go off of it if
it is not your cup of tea so I can just
say that it has helped me so much and
it's definitely boosted my
self-confidence and I feel so awesome
with my skin now so with all that being
said we're going to go ahead and roll
into the skincare routine and I'm also
going to put some clips in of my skin
without makeup because I am wearing
makeup right now so you can see like the
full effect I guess so as promised I'm
doing my skincare routine right now
sorry if it's echo
but I first used my Neutrogena makeup
remover wipes
I love these I'm very sensitive eyes and
these are really the only ones that
don't burn my eyes I'd start off by
doing my face makeup like taking that
off first and then going over my eyes
also am I going to let I do have a
breakout right here I got this because I
try not to be product and my skin did
not like it this is just a stain from a
boy has like two months ago so just
wanted to clear that up I haven't had
any since these though next I am using
the clinic liquid facial soap I've used
this for years I really like it's a very
gentle cleansers I'm just going to go
ahead and use that right now I really
like to work this into my skin her like
maybe a couple of minutes or so just so
it really gets in so for my toner I use
the Clinique clarifying lotion toner I
really like this as well it kind of gets
off all the excess makeup that the
cleanser and the makeup wipes did knock
it off as you can see it taking off all
the excess makeup so definitely use a
clarifying lotion or a toner because
this will still be on your face if you
don't then I use the Clinique Moisture
Surge lotion I really like this it is
like a gel um
texture and it feels really great on my
skin and I use this in the mornings
and the night times it's my favorite
moisturizer ever definitely 10 out of 10
to recommend it I think going with my
clinic under eye product I really like
this it keeps my bags down because I
don't get a whole lot of sleep so then
the last product I go in with is the su
Lauder dark spot correcting night serum
I really just like this as a night serum
I think it really just makes my skin
kind of more glowy and I don't really
have dark spots necessarily but this
seems to keep my skin clear so I just
like to go in and put that around like
my t-zone and my cheeks so that is it
for my skincare routine at night I would
definitely recommend having a skincare
routine and not going to sleep with
makeup on because that's probably the
worst thing you can do for your
so just make sure you cleanse it every
night and this one's my keeping my skin
clear so yeah but if you have any more
questions definitely leave them down
below in the comments I would love to
answer some of your questions if I can
get to them and while you're at it you
might as well go watch my last video
which was a first day no first week of
school outfit of the week and I had a
ton of fun filming that and you can see
some outfits for school that are school
appropriate and I'll see you guys my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
