very anticipated video and it's going to
be a how I film edits make my videos I
get a lot of questions about what I do
behind the scenes to create my videos
whether it's what music I use how I edit
you know what camera I uses all those
things so today we're going to get into
the nitty-gritty of what it really takes
to make a youtube video and how I make
my make sure to subscribe if you like my
videos and if you want to see more and
like this video if you want to know more
about how to make videos because you
know learning new things is great so
let's just go ahead and get into the
video so the camera that I use is a DSLR
camera it is a Sony 835 so it runs for
about 650 dollars on Amazon I believe I
have one other lens here that I use
pretty often it is a 50 millimeter lens
and I think it's an F 1.8 if I'm not
mistaken this lens was about a hundred
and fifty dollars and it's a lot more
crisp than this lens but I can't use it
since it is so zoomed in but I do want
to build up my collection of lenses
because they really change how your
video looks but I just kind of alternate
between the kit lens and then this lens
one thing that I love to do is find
really cool locations to film at whether
it's for my lookbooks or am I getting
ready videos or anything I just like to
go out into the world and find cool
places because I think it's much more
entertaining than sitting here in my
boring bedroom I either have my sister
Jaime or my boyfriend gunner fill my
videos because I think it looks better
when someone else is filming you than
whenever you're filming yourself on a
tripod moving shots can sometimes be
more entertaining than just sitting on a
tripod if you know what I mean and if it
is cloudy like it is today I will change
the setting on my camera to where it has
more of a warmer color tone I think warm
color tones kind of look better and
they're more welcoming to an audience by
the really cool tone the tripod I use is
a Sun pack alter 7000 TM so I like it
it's really really sturdy I think a good
quality tripod is pretty essential I
also want to note that all the supplies
I use will be linked down below so if
you want to go to the links and
it will all be down there so here the
editing aspects of videos I use iMovie
which may be a shock because it is a
very basic program it's really easy to
use but if you figure out stuff that you
can do on there it can really make your
videos pretty awesome I also have Final
Cut Pro but I still haven't learned how
to use it that much I'll just make like
intros and outros with it but for now I
just use iMovie so I'm gonna go ahead
and go into some tips for little things
that I do with it so one thing that I
like to do is change up the speed of
each clip so we'll take little sections
of a clip that I like and then I will
change them to fast or slow and I just
think it looks really cool at the end of
the clip I also enjoy finding different
light filters on YouTube so I will just
look them up on YouTube and find some
that are royalty-free and then I will
use YouTube or YouTube to mp4 and I will
download them and put them overlay them
on top of the clips I think this just
adds kind of coolness to your clip so
don't really know how to describe it but
I like how it looks and I will change
the opacity so you can still see the
other clip if that makes sense if a clip
is a little bit shaky I will stabilize
it using the smooth clip motion and this
will definitely kind of make it smoother
to watch and sometimes it looks bad but
sometimes it looks good also if you
don't want your titles to fade just go
right click on the thing go to project
properties and then go to title fade
duration and turn it to zero and this
will make the text appear faster and
sometimes I like to clone myself by
taking the same clip and overlaying one
on top of the other and then going to
kind of the video effects and going to
flipped and that way there's two of you
the I don't want to tell you guys
everything that I do with anything
because I think that is kind of a
personal thing and some things are
unique to my videos so I'm not going to
tell you everything one thing that I
find people don't really invest in is
voiceover equipment so recently
I got to this bad boy it is a blue Yeti
microphone and I think these are about
150 to 200 dollars I want to say and
then I also got this little pop filter
that goes over and it makes it more
clear voiceovers are super important
especially if you are doing kind of
how-to videos people are gonna be
listening to your voice and you don't
want to sound scratchy so this is what I
use it is kind of more expensive than
your standard microphone but it is
really good quality and it's super easy
to use I'm all about stuff that's easy
to use so I definitely recommend this if
you're looking to upgrade your once over
quality I also like to use really cool
different fonts I actually found this
site from Hello Kitty XO what you want
up here videos but it's called
dafont.com and it has a ton of fonts to
use they're really cool and unique I
love going on there and finding all my
fonts cuz you can find different things
rather than just the generic you know
once I come on your laptop some of my
favorite artists use and videos are alts
you walk the moon Phoenix the MAL police
and Foster the People I use Foster the
People like nobody's business I just
love that band
a lot of youtubers just use this same
song and it's so repetitive and I don't
really like to do that I always change
up my music because it's nice watching a
video and learning how to do your makeup
but also getting some really cool music
recommendations those are a few of my
favorite artists but definitely just
find remixes to use and yeah right now I
am using natural lighting and I think
natural lighting always looks the best
because it is natural so so you can see
this is my setup right now but if you
are a person that likes to film at night
I think it is wise to invest in some
artificial leg I got mine from cowboy
studios and they are these softbox
lighting so they're pretty much the most
natural lights you can get however I
don't really like to use them all that
often because they do look artificial
they have a very yellow lighting which I
don't really like I like white lighting
better sometimes they do look good
though I filmed my recent video
gunner with these lights so if you want
to see what they look like you can
definitely go check out that video to
see yeah it all depends on what your
room is what color it is and what
lighting looks best for your videos but
I just referred after lighting I think
it always looks the best so those are
all the things that I do behind the
scenes on my videos make sure to comment
down below if you have any more
questions about them because I will be
answering the comments in this video

see more videos from me I upload pretty
much every Monday and Thursday and
