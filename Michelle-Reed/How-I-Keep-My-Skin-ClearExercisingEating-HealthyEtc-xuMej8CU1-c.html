guys how I keep my skin clear by eating
healthy exercising and what I use on my
face so hope you guys enjoy so part one
is exercise now me personally I'm not
wanting just hardcore workouts like this
in my room I'm actually on a dance team
at my school which I love it's drill
team and so every morning I dance for a
couple of hours stress is one of the
number one things that causes acne and
so I feel like dancing is a good way
just to get that stress out of my system
and it's really fun and I enjoy it how
part two is eating now me firstly I
don't eat that healthy let's be honest
I'm a teenager and I like junk food I
like my Cheetos I like my popcorn but
you know sometimes you just got to put
the Cheetos away let's be honest one of
my favorite fruits is apples because
they taste good and you can add stuff to
them just to make them taste better I
just so sometimes I like to eat them
with peanut butter just if I'm feeling a
little bit different I know it's not the
healthiest thing in the world but it's
better than eating Cheetos so this is
what I like to eat for one of my snacks
every once in a while I do eat other
fruits than this but this is just one of
my favorite snacks
but I still want my Cheetos now part
three is skincare the products that I
use so first I have to have my hair up
in a bun in a headband when washing my
face
the first thing I use is my almay makeup
remover wipes I just use these on my
eyes to get rid of any eye makeup I have
to my head who when we first kissed you
made and then I use my handy dandy clear
sonic which kind of is a deep cleaner
for my skin and when I'm breaking out
I'll use this Neutrogena cleanser
because it's a little more intense but
right now my skin is pretty clear so I'm
just using my Clinique liquid facials so
so then I just get my face a little wet
and then I use my Clarisonic I know
there's like a specific way to use it
but I kind of just go with you know how
I'm feeling I'm not really one for
following the rules so I just kind of
use it however I feel like it and then I
just rinse it off and then I use my
clinic clarifying lotion just to turn my
face it gets rid of any excess makeup
that I didn't get off earlier because
obviously when you wash your face it
doesn't get off everything as you can
see now the staple product that I always
use this act zone it's from a
dermatologist but I absolutely love it
it keeps my skin it's so clear so it's
just like a gel and you put it on your
face after you tone it and it keeps my
skin so clear and it keeps all of my
breakouts to a minimum so I love it
then lastly i just use my Surrey boy
stur Iser because moisturizing your skin
is very very important after using all
the harsh products on your face you just
want to keep it all soft and then I just
brushed my teeth because you know you
kind of have to do that and yeah that's
it for my skincare routine I hope you
guys enjoy this and I hope I gave you
guys some tips to keeping your skin
healthy XOXO the shelf</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
