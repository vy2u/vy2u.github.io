you guys how to always look put together
by showing you guys five of my favorite
outfits this video is actually inspired
by all my favorite Instagram bloggers
who always look like they have
everything put together and their
outfits are always perfect in their life
is perfect
and these are find my favorite outfits
that just make me feel put together
along with give you guys tips on how to
always feel put together this videos
also in collaboration with Daniel
Wellington because if you guys know me
you know I love Daniel Wellington and
it's any company exhibits the essence of
being put together I definitely think
it's Daniel Wellington in this video I
am showing you guys three of my favorite
of their petite watches I have the erm
one which is the black and brown one I
have the Bondi watch which comes in a
really pretty white color and then I
also have the rose gold mesh stroke so
whether you like leather straps or mesh
drives Daniel I can't have them all and
these are so so so beautiful and also
pairing them with the rose gold little
cuff because it is a nice little
addition basically in this video I'm
gonna show you guys how I style these
watches because I think about wearing a
watch within your outfit is just a way
to immediately look more put together
and to immediately look like your outfit
just kind of goes all together and I
don't want to be Daniel and some watches
always makes me feel like my outfit just
kind of comes together and it completes
things really nicely the reason why I
like these watches so much better than
most watches is because they really
aren't pretentious they're just really
simple and they honestly do the job of
letting you know what the time is but
they do in the classy way without
everything being so like flashy which is
just not my style as you guys know and I
feel like the first thing to learn about
being put together is something that you
should have to like try super hard up
maybe something as simple as just adding
a really nice watch here outfit so I'm
very very excited to show you guys how I
styled all these watches I will have the
link to Daniel lines in down below I
also have a coupon code it is just
Michelle Reed if you would like to get
15% off your orders I'll have the links
to all the watches that I'm styling in
this video down below I hope this video
helps you guys let's get into the outfit
so for my first outfit I am rocking this
denim on denim look which I'm normally
so opposed to guys I usually don't like
it but for some reason I'm really too
Innis so my dress is from the brand
princess Polly and then my vintage jean
jacket is actually from a thrift store
called no relation vintage in New York
it's really really awesome for my watch
I'm wearing my white Bondi Daniel
Wellington watch I love this one because
I think it matches the Congress really
really well and then my necklace is from
made well and that's pretty much it for
this first denim-on-denim outfit my
second outfit I am rocking this jumpsuit
which is actually from the bran princess
Polly again I love how the back is open
I think that anything was to tie in the
back so it immediately looks like you
have your outfit put together or my
watch I am wearing the Durham Daniel
Wellington watch and then I also just
threw on a bandana from Michaels because
I thought it added a little bit
something to the outfit and then I'm
just wearing my shoes which these are
from Nine West which are oddly really
really comfortable they don't look like
they would be but they're so so comfy
for outfit number three this one is
probably my favorite I love this bandana
is from Old Navy and then my white tee
is from Uniqlo and then my skirt is just
a black denim skirt from princess Polly
and then wearing my rose gold mesh
Daniel Wellington watch I think it went
really really well with this outfit and
it's definitely different than the
leather ones I really like it I was
wearing the same platform black shoes
from Nine West I think they add a little
bit of heel whenever I really want to
jazz up my out of it I think adding a
platform sandal is really nice because
it's a way to wear heels but not
actually wear heels for outfit number
four I am wearing these denim jeans
which are just from made well and
they're cropped and a little bit
distressed I think they're really cute
my top is again from princess Polly and
then I'm just wearing the same rose gold
mesh watch from Danielle Wellington I
thought it went really well with this
outfit and I also paired it with the
little cuffs because I think to go so
great together and then my shoes are
from Steve Madden there's some suede
little sandals I'm not usually one for
pants but I think that these made well
jeans really complete the outfit and
make it look very put together for my
last outfit this is probably the most
sporty look and also the most casual but
I think if you throw on some converse
with the skirt it immediately makes the
outfit look a lot more put together and
not just like you're wearing tennis
shoes with something my top is from
American Apparel and my skirt is also
from American Apparel and then I'm
wearing my white high-top converse I
love and then I'm just wearing the same
dirham Daniel Wellington watch which I
think
really really great with this outfit and
then I just threw my hair up into a
ponytail to give it more of a younger
vibe
suppose all the advice that I have for
looking put together let me know down
below what outfit was your favorite

interested in knowing also don't forget
