hey guys today I'm going to be doing a
video all about how to be a morning
person because I think with the start of
the new year it's good to have a routine
down and just start your year off with
good mornings because mornings are the
best I try to put very realistic tips
into this video because I hate watching
a video and seeing tips that just you're
like honestly I would never do these and
so these are the things that I actually
use because I have become a morning
person with having to wake up at 5:45
every morning I really gotten used to it
and I think I have mastered this skill
if you're new to my channel then please
subscribe the button will be right here
I upload every Sunday ish Thursday it
should varies but I will probably get on
a routine once this new year starts and
like this video if you want to become a
morning person because morning people
are awesome even though everyone says
they don't like morning people they're
secretly jealous so let's just go ahead
and get into the video my first tip
would be to open up your windows it's so
much easier to wake up in the morning
when you have natural light to actually
wake you up and it just gets you
motivated so just peek them open a
little bit at night and in the morning
there will be lights I know not everyone
has the luxury of getting to wake up to
natural light a lot of us wake up a lot
earlier but for those who do definitely
try this
never
next would be to give yourself time to
yourself it's so important to just take
five or ten minutes in the morning to
give yourself some me time whether that
be to read your Bible read your book
you know map out your day plan
everything in your planner whatever that
may be it's so great to start your day
off like this it's also super important
because you can't start your day unless
your room is clean and you have a clean
slate to begin with
have a lot of anxiety or worries when
you wake up try writing down all your
worries no matter how small or big they
may be and then tear them up and throw
them in the trash this sounds really
stupid but it really helps get all those
negative things out of your head so you
can start the day on a positive note
I'd also recommend setting your alarm
way far from your bed that way when it
goes off you actually have to get out of
your bed and turn it off and you can't
snooze it also helps get your phone away
from your bed before you go to sleep so
you don't stay up too late on your phone
doing mindless things before drinking
any caffeine make sure that you drink a
glass of water just to get your
metabolism going and it really kick
starts your day and a good way rather
than just going straight to coffee also
start the day off with a healthy
breakfast that is nourishing so you're
motivated to wake up because you want to
eat that's what I do I love to make
avocado toast basically I just mash up
two avocados you can add more stuff if
you like to I just like it plain and
then I will pop two pieces of toast in
the toaster and I will scramble up some
eggs and add some salt and pepper to my
avocado toast and I will eat this and
it's so yummy and it really gets me
going in the morning I cannot function
without breakfast it's so essential guys
it's the most important meal of the day
it's true you can also make these super
yummy breakfast cookies which are
actually healthy all you have to do is
mash up two bananas then you add in some
quick oats and some peanut butter and I
added dark chocolate chips you don't
have to if you're trying to be healthier
and then I just put these on a pan and I
cooked them in the oven at 350 for about
12 minutes I'll have the exact recipe
down below but these are so good guys
and they make such a good treat for
breakfast because they're really healthy
things in them and they're so easy you
can also use this for healthy cookies
they're awesome I ate a ton of them
today
one of the highlights of my day is
always getting ready I love spending
about 30 minutes or however long it
takes you to just do my makeup do my
hair relax drink some coffee so you
should definitely wake up a little bit
earlier so you have this time to
yourself just to look good and I also
have a playlist that I like to listen to
which I'll have a link down below also
try saving yourself some time and stress
by picking out your outfit in advance so
in the morning you're not scrambling
throwing clothes everywhere to try to
get ready it just makes for a great
morning when everything's picked out and
you're ready to go and lastly I love to
start my day with washing my face so
important just splash in cold water and
so you're waking up you feel good and
you're not growing tired hope you guys
enjoy this video got a few tips to help
you guys out let me know down below
which one you like the best like which
one you think you could actually see
incorporating into your morning routine
you should also go watch my last video
it was a what I got for Christmas video
which is awesome because you can see all
the things that I got and just enjoy a
last little taste of Christmas before
the new year and I'll see you guys in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
