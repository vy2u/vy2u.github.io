about my hair care routine
this gets requested a lot because I do
have relatively long hair and it's
pretty healthy and so I kind of wanted
to give you guys some tips on how to
grow long hair and also show you guys my
hair care routine I have a teenager so
I'm not like a professional one here but
these are just the tips that I have
found that work for me so besides that I
really hope you guys enjoy it or we're
going to go ahead and get into it
and don't even know what that was I use
the Red King color extended shampoo and
conditioner because I do have highlights
in my roots as you can see I don't have
a shampoo that keeps that color nice and
bright and so I use this shampoo and
I've used it for a while so after I get
out of the shower I like to air dry my
hair for about like ten minutes so it's
about like half dry if you know what I
mean before I use heat then I use my
it's its head American even carrots in
detangler I am super tingly here and so
when I'm going to get out of the shower
it's a nightmare but this really makes
it easy to brush and a big sign here is
super duper smooth whatever your here is
what it's really really prone to
breakage whenever you brush it so use
something like a wide tooth comb or a
wet brush just so it's a lot easier on
your hair that won't break it and make
it unhealthy and all that stuff and I
blow-dry my hair with the Chi touch blow
dryer which I love because you can set
the heat setting the speed and the ions
I don't know but it's super cool and a
bullet rise but you're really really
fast and then once I'm done blow-drying
my hair I usually use the kenra platinum
silky gloss it makes my hair nice and
shiny and it just makes it look overall
a lot more healthy a lot of people want
to know what I asked for when I get my
hair cut
typically I like to get long layers and
I do like to get a lot of my hair cut
off because I don't like having like
dead ends and stuff so I usually get
about two inches off every time I get my
hair cut
so now we are on to the actual tips for
long hair these are five tips that I
live by and I love and they work so try
them out if you want like I said this
causes a lot of breakage and it's so
unhealthy for your hair my hairdresser
actually got really mad at me when I
told her I did that so definitely use a
wide tooth comb or a wet brush if you
want to brush your hair while it's wet
but still keep it healthy he is very
very damaging on your hair and you do
not like being mean to your gorgeous
locks so only use heats when you
absolutely feel like you need it if you
are having a bad hair day I would
recommend just doing a no Heat hairstyle
which I actually did one of these so you
can go and check it out if you want some
more ideas for what to do with your hair
but yeah I definitely don't use heat all
that often maybe use it for special
occasions if you do wash your hair often
like me use a shampoo that doesn't have
a lot of sulfate in it that is a very
strong chemical that's not that good for
your hair so maybe use a gentler shampoo
I will have a list of shampoos down
below that I recommend because I know
it's just not ideal for everyone to only
wash the hair once a week socially when
you're really active like I am so that's
kind of a different option to take I
mean it's not as good as not washing
your hair as often but it still works I
know when you're growing out your hair
you never want to cut it you want to go
in gear without cutting it but that's
not good for your hair it is not gonna
look healthy it's not gonna look pretty
it's just gonna look like these dead
locks if you were gonna be like do get
your hair cut more often but cut off
less so every time you start to gather a
lot of dead ends maybe go to your
hairdresser and just get like half an
inch cut off and so you can let some
healthier hair grow out
sometimes the over washing and the heat
really takes a toll on your here so give
it a little bit of TLC and use a deep
conditioner this is the one that I use
it is the 3 minute miracle by Aussie
it's super cheap I think it's like 3 to
4 dollars I love this stuff it makes my
hair is so soft and it smells like
coconuts so whenever I put it in my hair
and the next day my hair smells like
coconuts and it's greatness so if you
are struggling with really dry hair
maybe do this twice a week but I think
it's very very good to use a deep
conditioner to moisturize your hair so
those are actually all the tips I have
for you guys I really really hope I
helped you guys if you have any tips for
growing out long hair leave them down
below because I'm sure other people
would greatly appreciate them give this
video a like if you want long healthy
