not again not much longer every way hi
friends today's video I'm going to be
showing you guys how to look pretty
without trying now I know that beauty is
something that is subjective and
definitely I believe that inward beauty
is the most important I'm always an
advocate for it but there are just a few
things that I do am I make a routine or
with my outfit that honestly make me
feel really confident and that is what
I'm going to be showing you guys today
I'm very much a believer that whenever
you're confident in your appearance how
you look you have a better day you can
focus on things that matters as always
if you're new you should definitely
check that button down below and
subscribe I offer summer breaks I'm
going to be posting a ton I'm also
getting back into blogging on my second
channel so make sure to subscribe at
Michelle out of her shell and my last
plug when you're watching this video I'm
either going to be in Hawaii or I'm
going to be about a little boy or
something with Hawaii so make sure to

I'm gonna be posting a ton on there on
that trip and I can not wait so pretty
much all I have to say let me know down
below what you do throughout the day
that makes you feel pretty and
definitely assembly interested and it
was basically all I have to say I love
you guys and let's go ahead and get into
it so starting with fresh skin I always
like to use something that is a setting
spray to make my skin feel fresh and
clean I'm also going in with this
Clinique
acne solutions foundation to kind of
clear my skin and just give my skin a
nice easy canvas going into concealer
this is the innocent nature line I'm
just applying it under my eyes as a nice
highlight it always brings a little
light in my face and just kind of lifts
my eyes I'm also using some translucent
powder underneath my eyes to set that
and I'm also putting that all over the
rest of my face for bronzer I am using
my Too Faced chocolate Soleil because I
always feel a lot more confident when I
have a little bit of a tan and then I'm
just going in with a peachy pink blush
all over my cheekbones to kind of give
myself a nice glow and I'm going in with
a clinic highlight because highlight
always brings a lot of light into my
face and it instantly just kind of
boosts my mood and my confidence level
and then going in with some brow gel and
I'm just shaping up my brows because
stick brows are totally my favorite and
I love filling mine in and then going in
with my meet matrimony palette I'm
applying a little bit of bronze shadow
to
my eyelids and they're just calling my
eyelashes and applying my L'Oreal lash
stiletto mascara is it really length is
my eyelashes and just kind of opens them
up and makes them look a lot bigger and
then using a pink lip liner and just
applying this to my lips to give my T
lips a little bit of a Rouge shade and
that is all for the makeup it's super
natural and pretty but overall just
always makes me feel very confident I'm
pretty sure fashion anything that ties
around the waist is a blouse always
makes me feel super confident and pretty
this one is from TJ Maxx I also love
off-the-shoulder tops because they
really accentuate the collarbones and
they just instantly make me feel a lot a
lot prettier this one is from Urban
Outfitters I also have this dress which
is TJ Maxx or from TJ Maxx that I also
love a ton if it's so so pretty
jumpsuits are also my favorite because
they always make me feel a lot taller
and leaner I just think they're
SuperDuper comfortable this one is from
the brand 2020s as well as this one
which has beautiful stripes which are
also vertical so they make you look a
lot taller especially your legs this one
is also from Windsor I think it's so
cute and it's printed and beautiful I
also love dresses that tie around the
waist because they really situate your
waist and they make you look a lot more
fit and flattering
I also have the Sun which is from j.crew
the first one was from made well as well
high-waisted skirts are also one of my
favorites because they always define
your waist a lot and they hold
everything in that one is from Zara and
this one is from American Apparel I just
think they're really cute and flirty and
overall just beautiful I also love
skirts that tie it around the waist
because again they situate your waist
and they're also super comfortable and
they just always make me feel really
confident like I take on the day because
they're all so SuperDuper comfortable I
