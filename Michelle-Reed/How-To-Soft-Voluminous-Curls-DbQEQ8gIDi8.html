hair tutorial for you guys because every
time I curl my hair I always get
questions on how I do it so I decided
that this video would be appropriate to
do these very like soft bouncy and
voluminous curls and I absolutely love
them they're kind of more money like
fancy you're done up curls you know I'm
saying also I want to say I'm not very
good with hair I'm pretty bad so this is
super simple and I'm sure you can do it
because anything I can do you can do I
promise also it's like 70 degrees
outside today so I decided to wear
shorts because you know why not there
also might sell our shorts so they make
me really happy so I wore them so yeah
with all that being said I'm just going
to go ahead and get into the video so
first I'm just brushing out my hair to
prepare for the curling and then pinning
back my bangs taking my Hot Tools wand
it's a little thicker than the normal
one I take about an inch of hair and
wrap it around the barrel and hold it
for about 10 seconds or so and then I
let it to the palm of my hand and then
pin it to the top of my head this way
the curl sets and it gets a lot bouncier
and softer rather than if you just let
it go
so once you're done just hairspray this
cute contraption to your head and then
start on the other side I'd say that
this takes me about 20 minutes or so to
do so now your hair should look like
this and I'm letting it sit for about
five minutes just so the curls can kind
of sit there for a little bit and then I
am unpinning them and just letting them
fall and you can see they're so bouncy
and curly and pretty and it's just
amazing i love them so yeah that's the
end of the hair tutorial just finish it
off with some hairspray and you're done
hungry for love
so that's the end of this video I really
hope you guys enjoyed this let me know
if you did and let me know any other
requests you have a for future videos
because I'm always thinking of ideas and
stuff to do for you guys please ignore
my awkward hand motions I don't even
know what I do is I can without the end
of this video I hope you guys enjoyed
and I'll see you guys my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
