bout that bass no treble um hi everybody
today I'm going to be doing a how to
start a YouTube channel video actually
see one of these videos a really really
long time ago it's one of my most viewed
videos even though I look like a fetus
and I don't even know what I'm saying
just to kind of rewrite those memories I
decided to do an updated version of this
video with my new updated tips if you've
ever wanted to start your own YouTube
channel make sure to give this video a
like because YouTube's awesome and like
you guys know I hate long intro so we're
just going to go ahead and get into this
my first tip would be if you've ever
wanted to start a YouTube channel and
you've been kind of hesitant
do not hesitate I think that's one of my
favorite things about YouTube is the
fact that I can create whatever I want
and put on the inner end everybody can
see it it's actually the coolest idea
ever so if you've ever been scared or
nervous or anything just go and create
one and I promise it will turn out to be
a good experience my second tip would be
don't expect to get popular so fast
exposure and subscribers and comments
and all that good stuff takes a while to
progress I find my channel for four
years and I am where I'm at today
because I've been on for four years
YouTube is something that takes a whole
lot of time and you can't expect to get
popular so fast because it's not going
to happen
I third tip would be to create videos
that you yourself would want to watch if
you create videos that you think are
boring and you're not that interested in
then it's gonna come off that you're
born and not that interested I've worked
it would be about your first video
because I get a lot of questions about
what the first youtube video should be
on your channel I think that that's a
great time to show your talents so
really find something that you're good
at and emphasize it for me I really like
editing and so for my first video I
would probably do a lookbook or
something that I could put a little more
effort into and show my editing side and
my last general tip would be to upload
consistently consistent uploads are so
so important because I've seen people
create awesome videos for like a year
and then all of a sudden they'll just
and disappear and then when they come
back they don't get as many views and
that's really really sad whenever you
start a YouTube channel make it goal
that you're gonna upload once a week or
twice a week and stick to that schedule
I would just say for video quality if
you don't have the best camera and don't
worry about it I started my channel off
with like a little Sony Handycam and I
still gain subscribers using that so if
you don't have a Canon t4i with the best
quality lens and never things blurry and
pretty don't worry about it because
people will still watch your videos I
mean you do want it to be to the point
where people can see you and see you
clearly but it doesn't have to be all HD
and perfect I still don't have perfect
lighting lighting is something I
struggle with so much but I would
suggest using natural lighting because
natural lighting always looks the best
because it's natural I actually bought
artificial and like studio lights to use
but I barely ever use them because they
washed me out and they make me look
those lights and I just don't so if you
are starting out just maybe try to film
in front of a window a little far back
so you're not like straight into the
light you know but just kind of film a
little far back to the point where they
can see you filming and see your face I
think no matter what camera quality you
have that you have nice decent clean
editing people will enjoy your videos
when I first started off with YouTube I
used Windows Movie Maker which is a PC
program and it's very simple very easy
but it still worked
and I still gain subscribers with it
gradually then I moved on to iMovie and
I love iMovie I think there's so many
things you can do with it I'm actually
like a master at imovie cuz I've used it
for years now I just now moved on the
final cut which is a more nitty gritty
kind of editing system like if you're
first starting off with an editing
system I would recommend watching
YouTube tutorials just sit down maybe
with some snacks and just learn a few
things about your editing system and
then gradually just play with it until
you get
YouTube has this thing called copyright
where you can't just go on iTunes buy a
song put it in your video and get paid
for it
copyright is really hard to get around
and it's confusing and to be completely
honest I don't really get it so I can't
tell you guys exactly what music you can
or can't use if you want music that's
definitely royalty free and you can use
in your videos there are sites that sell
royalty-free music you have to buy them
and they run it different prices but
that's a way that you're not going to
get copyrighted for sure you use up and
cicadas decided to come out right now so
video you are really done sometimes
you'll spend hours upon hours on editing
this video and making it perfect but
then you'll spend like five minutes on a
thumbnail and it looks bad and no one
gets to see your incredible editing what
I use to edit my thumbnails is PicMonkey
because I'm pretty sure that's what most
people use in my guru community it's
really easy to use and you can make
really cute thumbnails and such
I usually go on there and do all of my
text on there and then I'll go on to
pixlr.com and do some edits and focusing
all that kind of stuff definitely check
out that site if you're one you want to
use for thumbnails so I am partnered
with a company called style Hall and I
became partnered with them when I had
around ten thousand subscribers I make a
certain amount of money per thousand
views I make that's how I make my money
a lot of people want to know how to get
partnered style ball I don't really know
how it works now but whenever I got
partnered they sent me an email and told
me all about it and then I applied for
it and that's how I became partner
definitely if you're wanting to get
partnered with a company you link a
business email address to the bottom or
the description of your videos and
that's a good way for them to contact
you next thing I have to say is to be
creative with your videos
don't go a copy other youtubers because
I can reassure you people will notice
people get very very mad whenever you
copy other youtubers even if you didn't
know that they made this video and yours
and similar people will attack you so
make sure you're creating creative
original content I think it's okay to
use the same video idea as someone and
do the same topic but just make it
different and make it your own thanks I
would say to be yourself don't start a
channel and pretend to be someone else
because people will notice that you're
trying to be something that you're not
so from the start you know be yourself
and if people don't like your
personality then that's okay with them
because you'll find people that do my
last kind of miscellaneous thing to say
would be to link your Twitter and
Instagram so people can connect with you
through social media and I think that's
a great way to get followers on there
you kind of advertise your channel
through your social media so that is all
I really have to say about starting a
youtube channel I really really hope
this was helpful for you guys make sure
to leave more specific comments that you
have down below and I will try to reply
to them I'm not promising I'll reply to
everyone but I do try to reply to a lot
of my comments so kinda we've got to
take a break with this video for my back
to school videos because I don't want it
to be like an overload of back to school
videos if you know what I'm saying
I still making those though so make sure
to request those videos as well and I'll
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
