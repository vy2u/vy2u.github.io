very requested in just kind of exciting
video in it it's going to be a house our
YouTube channel video because I get so
so many questions on this cuz I feel
like it's kind of difficult I think we
could all agree starting YouTube channel
can be kind of stressful in just
clueless and especially if you're new
you're like black and I just want to
answer all your questions hopefully on
house our YouTube channel so the first
thing I want to talk about is make sure
before you start a channel ask yourself
if you're starting it for fame or fun
because I definitely think there's some
people who go into YouTube thinking oh
I'm just going to do this because I'm
going to get money I'm gonna be famous
just like math bar bo7 not a good way to
go because we're not going to be famous
the first week you make a youtube
channel I think we can all agree on that
and if that's what you're expecting
definitely YouTube is just a hobby and
it should be just for fun and if you
make it big that is awesome and that's
of course that's probably our goal
definitely just make sure you're not in
it just because you want to be famous I
feel like that's just something a lot of
girls think that they're to be famous
second thing I'll be talking about is
camera quality because a lot of people
ask me like Michelle I don't have the
nicest camera I don't have a Canon t4i
but I still want to make videos and my
answer movie yes you can because
honestly quality is not that important I
mean yes some people are more drawn to
videos that have better quality but just
starting off don't go out and buy a
candy camera that's like a thousand
dollars and cost your parents or
yourself before Jim because it's not
really worth it when you're first
starting out when I was younger I used
to just use a Sony Handycam which I will
link my camera suggestions down below in
the description box like different price
points it was honestly a great camera I
still use it occasionally and I loved it
and I had like 10,000 subscribers with
that thing so I think that felice a
camera quality is not the most important
thing in the world but make sure they
can hear you because I will click on
some videos and like
as you know you want your audience to be
able to hear you kind of a no-brainer
there but with editing I would say
editing is more important than camera
quality because if you have awesome
editing and you're just really like
clean-cut editing it doesn't have to be
something fancy like Final Cut or
anything I just use iMovie which came
with my laptop if your editing is just
clean cut and easy to watch I guess that
makes them feel like that is more
attracting than a really great camera
quality as I was talking about making a
good channel name I totally regret mine
it's a long story how it happened in
five years from now I'm still gonna like
this day because if you don't like me
it's sad don't use a whole lot of
numbers don't be like Beauty girl four
to five six eight nine two one zero
because nobody's going to remember that
you want something that people are going
to remember like missglamorazzi really
think about your YouTube channel for a
while make sure you really like it and
you're gonna like it five or 10 years
from now because I really don't like
mine the next question I get is what
should my first video be and this is a
really hard question for me but I would
say a good starting video would be a
lookbook who can know what kind of style
you are what your personality is through
your clothes I guess I know how people
say do a popular video like oh what's in
my purse video or something but I think
with a lookbook you can really show your
camera skills editing skills and fashion
skills just with one video I feel like
it's a great way to start off on YouTube
next thing that I would recommend is
uploading frequently because if you just
upload like once every month people are
not gonna watch your videos oh she
disappeared so I'm just gonna
unsubscribe from her because she never
uploads so I would say a good uploading
rate is twice a week I feel like that's
perfect
like maybe every Sunday and Wednesday I
don't really have a schedule which is
probably annoying to something you want
to upload wherever I want to but I try
to upload at least twice a week not too
frequently like every day or else people
will get bored of the load frequently
but not too frequently and like I said
twice a week is perfect I would say now
the next thing I want to talk about is
being creative because I feel like
nowadays being creative is so hard on
YouTube everybody nowadays kind of doing
like the exact same tag videos the exact
same outfit videos what an example that
I have who I absolutely love her name is
ballet I think that's how you say it or
like you ting in the bell only kind of
down Mara her videos are so creative if
you're running a good example on how to
be creative I would definitely leave her
down below she has amazing videos and
you can tell she's going to go far on
YouTube because her videos are so
creative and just think outside of the
box and don't just sit down and film a
video every single day for me firstly I
think that people like create a video
now one thing I want to talk about that
it's a biggie here on YouTube that I get
so many questions on is copyrighted
music still don't really get it honestly
like I don't know the whole rules but
YouTube does have pretty strict
copyright rules can't use music that is
copyrighted I mean some gurus get away
with it I don't know how I can't get
away with it if you use a song that's
under 30 seconds I feel like you don't
get copyrighted for that but if you use
it like the whole video obviously you're
going to get copyrighted but yeah I just
use artists that I have permission to
use so I use like Landon Austin and Chad
sug and just penner those are like my
three go-to because they gave me
permission to use their music you're
wondering how do I get permission
Michele I literally have five
subscribers like they're not going to
email me back or anything just go ahead
and try iMessage Landon Austin and he
literally
like message me back within two hours
which kind of fangirl because of all
those videos so go ahead and try
messaging people and make sure their
music is a copyrighted though the next
thing I'm going to be talking about is
getting partnered because I feel like
that also has a lot of questions as you
may notice I'm partnered with a company
called style hall or network and I
absolutely love them they're an awesome
network they give you awesome awesome
helpful tips on how to start your
channel to pay you per thousand views on
like a certain range oh well actually
contacted me and then we went through
this long process of all these documents
stuff yeah but I'm pretty sure nowadays
you can apply to be with them but just
get an get an email that is separate for
business inquires even if you don't have
very many subscribe maybe it would apply
now I don't know that's not how I got
partnered I was partnered with them
whenever I had I think ten thousand
subscribers or so so out-breath so just
go ahead and maybe you can try emailing
them and asking them like hey am I ready
to be a partner um I'm pretty sure you
have to be accepted and it takes a few
months if you do that but just one of
the reps emailed me and asked me if I
wanted to be a partner and that's how I
became a partner if you're wondering
Jerry that if you ever want to become a
partner that you don't use copyrighted
music or copyrighted videos because once
you do become partnered you will have to
private or delete all those videos and I
have to do that with a lot of my look
books that I loved and it sucked just
make videos that are copyright free so
the last thing I'm going to talk about
something I feel very dearly very close
to my heart
Annie is spam she really took me three
years to get where I am I did not send
one spam message or one spam comment I
did it all on myself somehow
for some crazy reason I got forty six
thousand subscribers from it and I'm
forever thankful but so degrading for
the person who's video that you're
commenting on when all they get is oh
I'm sorry I felt a little old school
videos about
that's also impossible for some know if
you have a passion for filming and you
want to show that don't leave spam
comments because I can say it's so rude
it's so rude and I know why people
probably get mad at me but there are so
many other ways to get yourself out
there do collab videos with people good
quality videos most video responses
enter contest I can tell you that's a
way better way to get yourself out there
than spam comments because if you're
honestly too lazy to make good quality
videos that people will love so you're
posting spam comments then that shows
how much you really care about your
YouTube channel if you make good videos
I promise you can get somewhere and
patience is the key like I said it took
me three years copying and pasting the
same comment to 50 of the Guru's videos
it's not the way to go so all in all if
you want to make a youtube channel
definitely try it there's nothing you
can lose from I can't believe I've
gotten this far it's so crazy never
thought this would ever happen to me
maybe you could happen to you if you
follow through with it and if you just
have a passion for you to try it out
because honestly there's nothing you can
lose like I said so yeah I think that's
the end of this video and if you guys
enjoy give this a thumbs up and if I
didn't get to your question just email
me or comment down below and I will make
sure to hopefully reply to you if you
have a specific question that you need
help with I'll see you guys my next
video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
