quick intro before we get into this
video you're about to watch my favorite
practical tips on how to live a
healthier lifestyle I know a lot of you
guys are probably making New Year's
resolutions to be fit to be healthy and
just honestly be a happier person so I
thought this video would be great for
you guys there are three things I want
to say before I get into this video one
I am NOT a doctor I'm not a dietician I
don't know everything so if I say
something that you disagree with her you
don't think works
it's just what works for me take
everything lightly in the end I think
that living a healthier lifestyle has to
be something that you commit to you can
make excuses all day long but you really
have to tell yourself that you want to
do it and you have to stick to it and
make it a habit or else it's not gonna
happen
number three would be just subscribe to
me if you're new to my channel I upload
every Sunday so you should definitely
subscribe right now I would really
really appreciate that let's just go
ahead and get into the video my first
step would be to work out regularly
definitely in the morning or at night
whenever you feel comfortable just
incorporate some exercise into your
routine so you're happy and you're
motivated and you're getting out there I
always start my workout with a mile run
just to get my cardio levels up and get
going and ready for my workout and then
I would do some ab workouts I usually
look on Blogilates and I'll find
something that she's doing or I'll just
do these ones that I end up doing a lot
all the time and then I will also do a
plank for about a minute to a minute and
a half and then I will finish with some
inner thigh workouts this is actually
one of Blogilates videos that I've put
down below it's so hard but it feels so
good guys you should definitely check it
out I love all of her workout videos and
then I will usually bike for a little
bit usually 25 minutes and I will do it
on hill mode in the gym just to kind of
burn some more calories and that's it
for my workout routine and it really
works for me if you ever find yourself
not wanting to workout or you kind of
stuck in a rut try working out somewhere
new and finding a new spot I found this
really pretty Park which was actually so
pretty I'm probably gonna work out there
more but it just really works to kind of
rejuvenate yourself and you don't get
stuck in the same old same old rut and
you try new things
my last tip would be to never ever skip
breakfast you need breakfast to get
yourself going in the morning and your
body needs it I love making avocado
toast
I showed this in one of my past videos I
don't have right here but it is so good
you just add some salts and pepper just
a little bit not to where it's too bad
use some whole grain toast and cut up
some fruit and it's such a great
breakfast and it tastes delicious
next trying to incorporate some fruits
and veggies into your diet I know we
always hear this and spear little kids
you don't eat your veggies but it's true
if you add some humus or something just
a little bit
it really makes veggies taste better and
you want to eat them so whenever you're
going to the cabinet to grab some chips
maybe try adding some fruit or something
instead and so you can eat it in
abundance and it's good for you and your
fold my next tip would be to cut out
soda this is actually my new year's
resolution because as these pictures
show soda is awful for you just read
them there's so many chemicals and sugar
in it and it's just a disaster in a
bottle so I'd recommend making some
detox water with some fruit instead so
you're getting your water in your water
intake levels are up but it tastes good
so I like to add some lime lemon and
strawberries and it tastes really really
good and it's so much better for you
than soda my next step would be just act
smart so whenever you're watching
Netflix or YouTube try putting your
snack in a separate bag so you don't eat
the whole bag you just eat a serving and
you're still full yet use it it over eat
this is a favorite for my snackers out
there because I love to snack my next
step would be to know why you are
working out it's so easy to go on social
media and see these fitness pages of
just these perfect bodies that are not
real they're photoshopped they're fake
and it's a disaster waiting to happen so
my suggestion would be to shut the
computer and do it because it makes you
feel good and you're a happier healthier
person who wants to live life to the
fullest not because you want to be a
certain weight because honestly life is
so much more than that and we are all
more than a number on the scale
so treat yourself like such so that's
everything that I have to show you guys
I really hope you guys like these tips
and found that they were useful I had so
much fun making this video for you guys
and I really really hope we can be fit
and happy in 2016 if you want to watch
my last video it was a clothing haul and
I showed you guys some winter pieces
that I recently picked up so I'll see
you guys in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
