to bring you guys a video all how eating
in college how to eat right in college
and how to not gain the freshman 15
there are a lot of disclaimers I want to
say before I get into this video because
I know it's eating videos it's
definitely something it's more sensitive
to people and so if you want to skip the
disclaimers you can go right here but I
do want to say a few things before I
start well I realized that college is a
really stressful time I have been in
college for a semester now so I know
that there are a lot of stresses and
things that come along with college so
I'm not even saying that anyway in
college is a bad thing because I think
it does happen
trust me college is so hard and with
everything on your plate it is hard to
eat right and to maintain a healthy diet
and so I'm not saying that's a bad thing
I don't think it should be something
that shamed I just know it's something
that a lot of people are concerned about
which is why I'm doing this video - I'm
not saying this is how you have to eat I
am NOT a professional I'm not a
dietitian I'm simply an eighteen year
old college student and this is what
works for me also vegetarian so I don't
eat meat so none of these things in this
video has me in it I do I say if you're
vegan vegetarian you can change any of
this for your own advantage everything
is subject to change according to what
diet that you stand for if you disagree
with thing you don't have to watch this
entire video you can click out also at
my school I wanted to mention that we
don't have a meal plan and so my
circumstances are a lot a lot different
because I actually have a kitchen in my
dorm so I cook all my meals I do all my
grocery shopping I don't have a meal
plan just because my school is so small
in today this video I'm going to be
going over what I eat in a typical
College day which definitely changes and
not saying this is every day this is
what I filmed I'm going to also be
showing you guys a grocery haul and then
just talking about the things I'll go in
here you should definitely subscribe the
button is right below right here I
upload one to two times a week I also
have a blog channel called Michelle out
of her shell if you want to check that
channel out on all my other social
medias this will be right here so you
know that's basically everything I have
to say for this intro so let's just go
ahead and get into the video reading out
for breakfast I always like to have
breakfast just because I think breakfast
is really really important and for me I
find whenever I don't have breakfast the
rest of my name
thrown off there usually consists of
oatmeal oatmeal is definitely one of my
favorites they like to put a lot of
frozen fruit I'm going to chips honey
almond butter a lot of good stuff within
my oatmeal I really like carbs in the
morning I find that that's the best time
for me to eat a lot of carbs it just
works really well for me I'm wearing I
will make avocado toast some mornings I
will just eat cereal some mornings I
will have community some morning I will
have eggs if I have extra time in the
morning to make them that is what works
for me these are all the breakfast items
that I really really enjoy eating I
think that they all work really nicely
and they only take about like 10 minutes
eat in the morning for lunch lunch is
something that is only harder for Meek's
unusually in class around lunchtime I go
to the Kings College and so I should
have to commute to schools I'm usually
there for lunchtime so typically I will
describe a sandwich sometimes I will
bring lunch with me I didn't have all
the cognitive in the morning that's
something that I really like to have for
lunch the meadow does have like rice or
like quinoa or salad or a sandwich don't
leave us not too difficult and then I
usually have a snack between lunch and
dinner you should a couple snacks which
either consist of apples and peanut
butter I eat a ton of fruit and College
fruit is something that I really really
like to incorporate in my diet or I will
have something with high so whether it
be like carrots or pretzels or something
like that it also drink coffee I drink
way too much coffee this is not
something that I recommend coffee is not
necessarily the best for you but I am in
college and so I'm just being straight
up with you guys something that I do and
tell me like it's drugs it's not drugs
November dinner I try to whip something
up that's relatively easy one recipe
that I made in this video was a Mexican
quinoa recipe which is just like quinoa
avocados tomatoes this is a lot of
vegetables I usually like to take in all
of my vegetables at dinner time because
it's something that I'm not that great
is doing so try to do that on dinner
time usually have a side salad to get
lettuce in there's another thing that I
like to have especially in the
wintertime whether that be like a
vegetable soup or something how to see
you my favorite recipes down below so
that's usually what my eating schedule
looks like I also eat out a few times a
week I live in New York City so eating
out is kind of something that everyone
does it's just easier because you are
going going going all the time I also
have weak spots where I do have days
right to seat really bad things last
night I pancakes I like 1:00 in the
morning so I'm not saying I am perfect
but for the most part is what I try to
stick to I usually like to go to Trader
Joe's whenever I go grocery shopping
just because it's the cheapest option
around me or a little bit of a walk for
me to get to but it also means I get an
exercise so I try to go to Trader Joe's
about once a week Trader Joe's hauled I
showed you guys in this video is about
what my typical you know grocery run
looks like
the number my tips for eating healthy in
college I'm going to share the things
that I find worth the best what I
mentioned this earlier but always having
breakfast and making sure that you're
having something that is good for you
and something that will sustain you for
the rest of the day I find whenever I
don't have a good breakfast my eating
schedule just thrown off for the rest of
the day drinking lots of water is so
important it's something that I've been
trying to get better at because I'm not
that great at it
but it's making sure you are having lots
of water exercise when you can I'm going
to be honest I don't have the best
exercising habits in the world my
roommate and I recently just got a gym
membership second semester so we are
trying but doesn't even have to be like
working out just taking the stairs when
you can walking places when you can
you're doing homework any try to go
somewhere into your homework travel
somewhere whether I need to like a 20
minute walk somewhere that's it easy way
to get an exercise I didn't live in New
York City and so I walk basically
everywhere and so I feel like exercise
is something that I'm SuperDuper worried
about for me personally whenever I have
time I always like to make sure I pack
my lunch for school because I find I
packed something that I really really
like it definitely makes my day a lot
better and it's healthier for me
especially if you do have a meal plan I
think that's a good idea
lastly my phaz tips and something that
I'm working to be better at this
semester is eating out less I know it's
really really simple that's just
something that I feel like always ends
badly for one you run out of money too
you're usually eating things that aren't
that healthy schedule how many times a
week that you want to actually eat out
and stick to that let us say in this
video if you have any other questions
just leave them down below I will
definitely be answering them should also
go watch my last video it'll be linked
right here thank you guys so much for
watching I'll see you guys made
excellent bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
