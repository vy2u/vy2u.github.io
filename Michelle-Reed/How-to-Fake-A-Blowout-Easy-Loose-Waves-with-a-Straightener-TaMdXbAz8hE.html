because I'm going to show you guys how
to do a fake blowout on your own so if
you're one of those people who's kind of
ballin on a budget right now like myself
this will definitely work for you guys
all I use is a straightener and some
hairspray so of course if you actually
go to a place that does that
professionally it's going to look a
little different but this is just my
version and how I've been enjoying
wearing my hair lately so many people on
my blog Channel and my Twitter and my
Instagram really wanted me to do this
tutorial which you should go follow me
on those platforms as well and so I
figured I would do this because I love
it and it's so easy and since it is so
easy this is gonna be a really short
video so if you want to see how to get
this hairstyle let's go ahead and get it
so to start off all I've done is washed
my hair and blow-dried it I haven't put
any other products in it because I don't
really like putting products in my hair
but all I'm going to do is brush through
my hair I like to section my hair into
two pieces I'm going to do the bottom
half first so I like to quickly just run
some hairspray through my hair not
anything too dramatic so your hair
doesn't get like crispy but just so the
waves hold a little more then I use my
straightener this is just a chi one I've
had this for a while I've always used
cheese straighteners but basically all
you're gonna do like to take a piece of
hair and I like to first just run it
through to straight in the hair first
and then I actually like to do the
blowout part so basically all I do is I
clamp down I get to about almost the end
and then I flip in and then I go down
with my hair and sometimes I will play
with it cuz sometimes it will turn out
like a little too curly and if that
happens it's okay to like fall in time
so you just go down straighten it first
I think on this one I'm going to try to
go down a little lower so it's not as
curly and then you just flip and leave
it and see this is more like what I like
just a short little like wave at the
bottom and make sure whenever you are
flipping the straightener that you're
flipping it underneath so go like out
and then around and sometimes I'll have
to like touch up and kind of like go
through it again to get the wave you can
take whatever size pieces that you want
to I usually bury them because I like
the ball to be different sometimes I'll
take bigger pieces sometimes I'll take
smaller pieces just make sure if you are
taking bigger pieces that all the hair
fits in the strainer sometimes I get a
little too crazy and it like all falls
out and then I just like to take my
hairspray and I like to go back over
just really lightly again to make sure
that they all stay and I've run my
fingers through it so it's not as crispy
you can also flip your hair the other
way if you like when it goes outward I
just think it kind of gives like a cuter
look whatever it's facing inward but
whatever suits your fail to just do that
and honestly just don't think about it
too much just like curl your
straightener and you'll get a really
more natural look if you're not trying
to make them all like look exactly the
same just taking my hairspray again and
I'm gonna run that through the bottom
and just kind of play with it I really
don't like with these looks structured
so just making sure to get them all
loosened so now we're onto the top
layers I'm going to go ahead and take
this down make sure when you're doing
this front piece so that you kind of
think about it a little more because
this piece tends to stand down I always
mess it up so running it through once
getting towards the bottom and flipping
it sometime
stuck and if you don't want it to be as
curly just try flipping the ends in a
little bit closer to the bottom like the
more you start up the more the curls
going to be a parent so just change it
to what you like this is about the level
of curliness that I like and it's always
going to fall throughout the day so I
like to how to do it a little earlier in
the morning so by mid afternoon it's a
really good
so after I finish I like to take my
hairspray and just run it through it
really just like work through all the
curls so you get a softer look and there
you have your fake blow out I really
really love this hairstyle because it
takes me ten minutes tops it's super
quick but it looks like you just spent a
lot of time doing your hair and stuff so
also I want to note that I find this
hairstyle looks the best when it's the
same day that I've washed my hair or
like the day after so as close as you
can get it to when you wash your hair I
think that's when it looks like the
softest and the prettiest I also really
like it because the next day I have
really nice just soft waves so I really
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial and
