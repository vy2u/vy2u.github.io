video all about how to make good grades
and study efficiently because one thing
you probably don't know about me is I am
such a nerd I'm probably the biggest
nerd ever you can ask my friends or my
family or my boyfriend I'm just like
school is just something that's really
important to me and I literally like
stay in my room studying instead of
doing stuff because I care so much about
my grades so we've been approaching the
end of the year I decided that this
would be pretty helpful because
everyone's gonna be taking finals and
tests and all that gross stuff and so I
figured that this video would be very
helpful for you guys so if you're having
trouble with your grades or studying or
anything feel free to watch the rest of
this video because I really think it
will help you now the first tip I have
is to use something that has helped me
since I was in like seventh grade or
something and that would be flashcards
now these are just plain white like
index cards some of them have lines on
the back or whatever I use these for
every single test I take because they
help me I'm not a kind of person you can
just look at a sheet of paper and
memorize it I have to flip through it
like a million times or else it just
doesn't process in my head and yesterday
we actually made flashcards
I took a grade and he told us a way to
do them that I think really helps it so
basically on the front in the middle you
just put what you're talking about and
some was American colonialism and then
you put for kind of facts on the sides
and so this one I just have like Dade's
and what happened and stuff and then on
the back you use all of those things
it's to write submission and this really
helps I know it's a little more in-depth
than you probably want to go but you
probably won't have to make as many with
this because you're covering a lot of
stuff with one flashcard
I think this is a really good method
especially if you're in history and
you're setting like time periods I think
it's great for that because you can
cover a lot of things and one flashcard
second thing I have to recommend is
making a review if you don't get one
because I know in high school teachers
usually stop giving out reviews close oh
it's high school
you're not middle school you orange so
they usually don't give out reviews I
would suggest making your own covering
the key concepts and vocab terms and
stuff that happen on a sheet and then
studying that also you can make that
tester you into flashcards because that
is another thing with me writing down
something multiple times helps me so
much and so if I write a review and then
copy that review on to flashcards and
then study the flashcards it really
helps put this stuff into my brain
better
I know taking notes in class can be
really boring and then your notes just
look terrible because you don't even
care it's like I don't need to write
that whatever I would suggest using like
different colored pens and highlighters
to make them look pretty and so you want
to take notes I know this is completely
weird me being a girl like if something
isn't pretty I just I'm not attracted to
it
sorry so I have my history notes right
here and I usually take them like this
because it helps me I ran out my notes
and then the key concepts I like put in
pink and dead vocab words I'll do in
blue I think this really helps me
because I'm looking back on my notes I
can just look at the vocab words and the
key concepts instead of reading all of
it so I definitely recommend taking
notes that are color-coded because that
definitely really helps me now the
fourth thing I have to say is don't use
your phone when you're doing your
homework
this is just a deathtrap I can't explain
it you're going to get sucked into
Twitter and Instagram in your text and
it's just not good so sometimes what I
like to do is put my phone somewhere
where I can't reach it
because once I'm on my bed doing my
homework I won't get up because I'm too
lazy so I usually set it on my dresser
and then just like forget about it I
think playing music is okay I'll usually
do that on my laptop
but just don't use your phone or else
you're gonna get sucked in and forget
what you're doing and you'll spend like
an hour on your phone not doing your
homework and that's just
the thing that I have to recommend is
right when you get home from school do
your homework don't procrastinate across
the nation is the devil and it will kill
your grades so I'd recommend immediately
when you get home from school just do
your homework I actually like to go home
and like eat a snack first or you just
snack while I'm doing my homework
because it helps me usually I get home
from school around 4-h and then I'll
start my homework at least like 4:15 to
4:30 because I don't want to put it off
I promise you we'll get stuff done so
much quicker and you know so much more
time afterwards to get other stuff done
that you need to order some chill
because I love to show I know a lot of
people who just don't study for tests
and some people can do that and be fine
I envy those people but I'm not one of
them if you know you have a big test
coming up in the next couple of days
start studying don't put it off don't go
hang out with your BFFs because you
think that you don't need to study
because I promise you do if you know
about a test in advance I would start
studying maybe like a couple days before
it so maybe make your flashcards then
you don't have to like go through all
but just make up and then the next day
just go through and then the day of the
test me to go through during lunch I
know that seems nerd and you're like all
my friends are gonna think I'm so uncool
but honestly what's better receiving
acceptance from your immature friends or
getting good grades and going to an
awesome college later on the line so
just flip through a couple times before
the test and make sure you got them down
as you can see flashcards are my main
tip for this video but I hope to see you
help you guys out those are kind of all
my tips that I have I promise they work
for me really really well so you should
definitely try them and if you do and
you do better on your test make sure to
tell me because I like to hear those
kind of things that I'm actually
some way I feel like I should be giving
away flashcards in this video but
unfortunately I use them all
so have nothing to give away to but
that's the end of this video and I'll
see you guys my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
