whole entire video on how I use my
self-tanner and how I stay tan in the
summertime on my vlog channel I
frequently show how I tan and stuff it's
a lot of you guys wanted me to do a
whole entire video dedicated to it so
that's what I'm going to be showing you
guys today and like always if you're new
to my channel you should definitely
subscribe the button I'll be right here
and I upload twice a week and I really
love making videos for you guys you
should definitely subscribe because it's
summer it's hot and I'm gonna be filming
a lot so let's just go ahead and get
into the video so first and foremost the
Tanner that I use is the st. Tropez
bronzing mousse in dark so it's the dark
one they have one that is just a normal
like their medium tone one and then they
just have the dark one I like this one
because I find that it lasts a lot
longer with the other Tanner I have to
use it pretty continuously and it fades
pretty quickly and so I really like this
it's pretty pricey and I will say it
doesn't necessarily last like a whole
entire week i exfoliate and moisturize
and really prep my tans really well and
it lasts maybe like four days max so I
kind of only like to use it whenever I
have an event or something or I know
I'll be filming a lookbook or something
and I just want to be a little bit
tanner then I will use it just because
it is expensive and it's not something
that I want to use all the time it also
has a self tanner scent so that's going
to bother you this probably isn't the
best thing to do so basically what I do
is I take my shower at night that I will
make sure to shave and exfoliate really
really well in the shower or exfoliating
I use my cleansing a body polish by
first day Beauty I really really like
this it's a charcoal kind of body polish
type thing and so I put this on my body
and I use this brush and just like one
of these brushes that like moves like so
I'll have a link to it down below not
sponsored but I basically put the polish
on this and just go all over my body and
it gets all of the dead skin off because
whenever you self tan if you have any
dry patches then the self tanner is
gonna clean to those and look really
splotchy so make sure you exfoliate
before and then I get out of the shower
and I will make sure to moisturize with
my Aveeno lotion so I'll just put it all
over my entire body and I'll let it sit
for about 10 minutes before I start
self-tanning so for the actual self tan
part basically what I do is I take the
mint which
about $6 this is really dirty I know but
I will take it I'll put two pumps of
this in there and I will do two pumps on
my legs and so I'll just go over my
entire legs and then I'll usually do
another pump in the back because often
times I'll miss the back of my legs and
so I'll just really really make sure I
work through and get it all spread out
it's gonna look really really green when
you first put it on but it definitely
develops to more of a brown color
throughout the day and make sure
whenever you're doing your knees or your
ankles you don't use a whole lot of
product I'll usually just use whatever
is left on the mint after I do it and
I'll run through my feet and I'll run
through my knees just because product
can get really caked up right there and
you look really orange if you like take
off huge sponge of it then for my
stomach I will just do about a pub and
I'll rub it all over my stomach and my
sides and then my arms I will do about a
pump on each sure that you really don't
focus on your elbows or else it's gonna
get really really kicked up there so I
try to mostly go along my shoulders
right here cuz I find it looks the best
on my shoulders and I'll just really
work through in circular motions and
basically just go at it and make sure I
have no streaks or anything and again on
your hands you want to make sure you
don't focus too much because they can
get very orange so then I do about a
pump of it on my chest just to get it
all there I really like how it looks on
my chest as well my back it's always
really really hard so I'll basically
just take it and like try to get my back
the best that I can but if you have
something that you know you're gonna be
wearing something that's really open in
the back make sure that you get someone
to help you because I find whenever I
try to do it it looks very streaky in my
back if you do it yourself so just try
to get a helping hand I usually grab my
sister or something to help me then I'll
just do like my lower back and my butt
and I'll make sure everything looks good
and then I will just sit on a towel for
about 10 minutes and let it dry because
it will be very sticky after you do it
and if you put on clothes and only rub
off on your clothes which it washes off
but and then I'll wear something that's
very very loose-fitting so I'll usually
wear like a loose dress or like some
loose pants or something to sleep and I
will sleep for like 8 to 10 hours and
I'll wake up I'll rinse it off when you
wake up the next morning you're gonna be
super tab just know that whenever you
shower a lot of that will come off so
then the next day you're left with a
really really nice looking tan like the
one that I
right now you can definitely do two
nights in a row if you want with a dark
one I find that I usually only need to
do one day but sometimes if I really
want to be tan I will do it two nights
in a row
and that's plenty like you don't need to
do it any more than that or else you're
gonna be crazy crazy tan and it's not
gonna look natural so I'd recommend two
nights max doing it and yeah that's all
I do for my self tanning routine I
really really encourage self tanning
rather than laying outside and stuff
just because laying out is really really
bad for you so now in terms of cancer
and skin cancer actually runs in my
family so I'd really encourage self
tanning if you guys are interested in it
I'll have all the links of the products
that I mentioned down below if you want
to go watch my last video it was a
graduation day in my life video so I
showed you guys like getting ready and
just hanging out with my family and it
was super fun so I definitely recommend
watching that and I'll see you guys my
next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
