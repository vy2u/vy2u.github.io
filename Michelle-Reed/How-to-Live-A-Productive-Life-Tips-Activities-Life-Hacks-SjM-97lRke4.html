take it slow but it's not typical is hot
my friends today I'm here to do a very
exciting video actually so happy be
doing this it's going to be a video
about how to be productive because I
know for me personally I love being
productive and getting stuff done and so
in this video I'm going to be sharing
some of my tips for you guys like some
activities that keep me productive what
makes me happy how I plan out my day all
that good stuff
like always if you're not already
subscribed to my channel definitely
subscribe right now I upload every
Sunday and Thursday and I'd love to have
you here a part of my family also give
this video like if you like being
productive like I do because it's such a
good thing
productivity is phenomenal and little
bit something said we're just going to
go ahead and get into the video my first
tip is to wake up early I was actually
reading something online about the most
successful people and they all woke up
before 6 a.m. now I'm not that crazy I
choose 8 a.m. in the summer but
definitely wake up early and take on the
day and don't waste it by sleeping in
starting off your morning with a workout
is also a good idea this gets your heart
rate moving and it makes you want to
achieve things also soaking up some
vitamin D is great for the soul so
definitely just get outside and get
moving so you're ready to take on the
day make sure you're listening to some
upbeat music while you're working out
just so you're motivated I actually
created a whole Spotify playlist for you
guys about my workout jams so I will
link it down below and you should
definitely check that out so you can
dorkly dance like I am right here well I
run I like to use my Aqua burst water
bottle which is great for those who like
to flavor their water like I do it's
super easy to use all you do is fill it
with your favorite flavoring I've been
using lemonade and fruit punch lately so
you just put it in the little pod secure
the pod and then press the button which
is super-fun and it disperses the
flavoring into the water filling the pod
up just once gives you eight 20 ounce
bottle refills which is so awesome it's
also BPA free and dishwasher safe so I
will have this link down below it's just
the coolest concepts and I love using it
when I'm running
Aran's or run it out on the go it's just
such a great little water model for
those who like to flavor their water you
can also get 20% off with a code 20 aqua
which will be down below the night
before the next day or the morning of
the day I'm currently on I will plan out
my day time by time just so I have a
plan of what I have to do what I need to
get done I also star important
activities that I must do just because
this keeps me on track and if I actually
write something down I'm more likely to
stick to it to the chase beam before
being productive make sure you have a
clean room because when my room is a
mess I know I'm a mess and so definitely
just pick everything up make sure you
have a clean slate that will calm you
down you can also listen to some music
while you do this or watch a new youtube
video like I did also try lighting a
candle I love doing this because these
scent relaxes me while I work instead of
watching Netflix or that next Walking
Dead episode if you are me try reading a
book I've actually been reading a lot
lately I really like Sophie Kinsella
I love her Shopaholic series a lot but
right now I'm actually reading 1984
because reading is definitely a lot more
beneficial for your mind than watching
Netflix and if you happen working for a
while definitely go treat yourself and
take a break so you can refresh and get
your mind back in the zone I love going
on little Chipotle breaks they're the
best and lastly if you've been stuck in
a rut of not being productive definitely
go find some inspiration whether it's
going on a little car ride 30 minutes
down the road or going to a whole nother
state definitely just go explore and
find inspiration I recently went to Ohio
and I really needed this trip because it
definitely kind of cleansed my mind and
got me ready to make some killer YouTube
videos for you guys
I'll have the video linked down below of
my whole week while I was in Ohio that
you should definitely check out so I
really hoped you guys liked this video
I've got a few tips on how to live a
more productive life because in the end
productivity is amazing and something
you should all strive for you should
also go watch my last video was a week
in my life video while I was
vacation and I had such a fun time
filming that video I love doing more
vlog style videos so definitely check
that one out and subscribe if you're not
already and I'll see you guys my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
