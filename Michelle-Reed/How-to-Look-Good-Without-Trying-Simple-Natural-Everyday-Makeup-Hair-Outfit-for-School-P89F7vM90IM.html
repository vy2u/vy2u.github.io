video that is titled how to look good
without trying I just want to give a few
disclaimers before I saw this video
because I know the title is kind of like
sensitive in a way well I'm not saying
that this is how you have to look good
this is just what makes me feel good
it's kind of a simple routine for
getting ready it is a take variables
also it still requires a little bit of
trying I'm not saying like this is
totally like oh you wake up in the
morning and you look like this that's
not exactly what I'm saying it's just
easier than doing like a 20 minute
makeup routine like this makeup takes me
about five minutes this hair takes me
like a single minute and then this
outfit super easy to wear also if you're
new to my channel definitely subscribe I
have loaded twice a week if you happen
to stumble across this my name is
Mitchell Reed so I hope you guys enjoy
this video and let's just go ahead and
get into it
so for makeup I'm starting off with
moisturizing my skin with my positively
radiant moisturiser really really
important if you're not wearing a ton of
makeup and then just concealing my under
eyes with my Maybelline instant age
rewind concealer I'm also concealing my
lids since I'm not wearing a ton I
shadow and then I just set that with my
Rimmel stay matte powder and then I set
my actual skin with my botanics boots
lighter-than-air powder and then just
going in and I'm applying my hoola
bronzer very lightly to my skin I'm not
really focusing on contouring just
adding some warmth and then I'm using my
Clinique cream blush on my cheekbones I
love cream blush for a more natural look
and then I'm just gently highlighting my
skin with my Mac soft and gentle
highlighter also on my nose and my chin
I am then just thickening up my brows
with my benefit gimme brow I love doing
bold brows if I'm doing a simple makeup
look and then I'm using my naked eye
shadow I'm just simply applying this in
my crease and then curling my eyelashes
and applying my Maybelline rocket
mascara and just kind of skipping
eyeliner
her lips I'm just applying my benefit
tint which gives a really really natural
finish and that is it for the simple
makeup for hair all I'm doing is parting
my hair in the middle and I'm loosely
gathering my hair and tying it in a low
ponytail and then really pulling out a
ton of pieces and kind of making it more
voluminous pinning back pieces now you
have a very simple ponytail that I love
to rock I also love adding my glasses
when I'm kind of going for more of a
natural look for my outfit I'm simply
wearing this romper from 20/20 Avenue
rompers are great if you're looking for
something easy just to throw on and then
I just have on an Urban Outfitters bra
let a couple of my favorite necklaces
and this made well cardigan because I
get cold everywhere I go and I also just
threw on my high-top white converse
because I think adding tennis shoes to
an outfit really makes it more casual
and cute and guys this outfit took
barely any time to throw on and I love
it
I hope this video gave you guys a few
tips on how to do a very natural look
and how to get ready really quick in the
morning it's just my favorite go-to look
when I don't really feel like trying too
hard you should also go watch my last
video will be linked on the screen
somewhere along with all my other social
medias and I definitely appreciate that
and I'll see you guys my next one bye
