today's video because it is a
Valentine's Day video whether you are
going out on a date or you're hanging
out with friends in today's video I'm
gonna show you guys a really classic
hair make up an outfit video I have
always been such a fan of Valentine's
Day even one of her was younger when we
would make like Valentine's Day boxes
and stuff I just love Valentine's Day
for me it's all about love it doesn't
matter like where it's coming from if
you got a boyfriend if you don't you
know down below it your plans for
Valentine's Day are because I don't
really know what I'm doing this video is
also in cooperation with Daniel
Wellington guys I don't think I am more
brand loyal to a brand other than Daniel
Wellington I wear these watches all the
time I have about three that I wear all
the time if you watch my vlogs my Daniel
Wellington watch is always on my wrist
right now they are having these really
awesome Valentine's Day bundles where
you can get a watch and you can get a
bracelet or you can get two watches it
depends on the bundles they have a ton
of different one and they also have this
really cute little heart charm included
which is so adorable they also gave me a
15% off code so if you want to get 15%
off a watch you want to buy one as a
gift I think that they make great gifts
you can use the comb she'll read plan on
posting an outside picture on
Valentine's Day on my Instagram so if
you want to follow me it's at Michelle
Reid over there and let's just go ahead
and get right into the video
so for makeup I'm starting off in my Too
Faced Born This Way Foundation and this
look I'm going for a really glowy look
and I think this foundation is a great
job I'm then applying my fit me
concealer underneath my eyes cuz I
really like to have bright under eyes
and then I'm just setting everything
with my Laura Mercier translucent powder
underneath my eyes and then I want to
keep this really glowy so I'm just going
on with a pressed powder and really
lightly going over my makeup and then to
add just an all-over glow I'm using the
Laura Mercier candle glow sheer
perfecting powder kind of over top of
the powder I just applied and then I'm
just using my Park Ave princess bronzer
and I'm applying this to my contour and
then also on my forehead and then I'm
just applying a little bit of a peachy
pink blush because it's Valentine's Day
so I like to have a little bit of blush
and then I'm just highlighting with my
Laura Mercier highlighter on my
chin cheekbones all over the place and
then I'm using my benefit gimme brow
because I've been really into just
natural brows and the naked 3 palette
I'm putting the shade of limit in my
crease and then I'm taking nooner and
kind of applying that in my outer corner
and then I'm using the laura mercier
rose gold cream shadow all over my lid
because I want to have a nice like
shimmery base and then just taking the
Too Faced natural eye palette I'm using
the shade silk teddy and I'm really
patting that on my lid to get a nice
glow and I've been skipping eyeliner
lately and I really like it so I just
curl my lashes and applied at my mascara
and then for lips I just took my Laura
Mercier extreme matte lipstick in the
shade ruthless which is a really pretty
pink and then I applied cabinet of a
Mahdi color over top of that and that's
it for the really simple glowy
Valentine's Day makeup I really like it
for hair I'm taking hair that I honestly
haven't washed in like four days let's
be real guys and I'm using a one-inch
curling iron and basically all I do is
wrap one inch pieces around and then I
kind of catch them in my hand and as
they're cooling down I pin them up
on top of my head so I do this all
around the rest of my hair and I kind of
just let these cool because basically
what happens is it acts like a curler so
whenever you take it down ten minutes
later they're really voluminous and
honestly a little puffy so I like to
brush them out just to make them more
like voluminous kind of Hollywood kind
of curls and that is it to get some nice
voluminous curls for my outfit guys I'm
gonna be honest I filmed this when it
was 20 degrees and it was freezing but
we did my dress is this super just
romantic dress from princess Polly I
love it this watch is the Danielle
Wallington Sheffield watch I love it I
think it's classy goes with everything
and then I just wore some black tights
than my Marc Fisher heels and that was
it for my outfit I think it's super me
but also really flirty and cute so
that's everything for my Valentine's Day
video I hope you guys really enjoyed
