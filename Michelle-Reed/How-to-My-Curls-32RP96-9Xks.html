and I'm brushing out my hair so I don't
have any tangles before I curl it and
then I'm just taking a clip and clipping
back my bangs I will be curling in
sections so I'm taking my hot tools
one-inch curling iron and wrapping it
around the barrel I take about one-inch
sections hold it for 10 seconds and then
I let it into the palm of my hand and
then slowly let down so I'm just doing
this throughout my hair and I like to
take different size section every time
so the curls aren't so like uniformed
and they're kind of more wavy and
different size and whatnot and also I
want to apologize for some of the
unattractive faces I'm making this I
don't really know what I was doing um
yeah I'm just gonna do this throughout
the rest of my hair and now I'm taking
my sebastian shaper plus her spray and I
like to kind of push up on my hair to
give it some volume and hairspray so now
I'm gonna flip it over and do the other
sections so I'm putting the curling iron
on like the top of my head wrapping my
hair around the barrel for my bangs and
letting it go so again I'm just doing
this throughout the rest of my hair it's
really easy and it only takes me about
20 minutes maybe I also did this without
a mirror so I don't really know how it
turned out but I mean I'm pretty proud
of myself no mirror
so that I'm just taking my hairspray
again and I like to flip my hair over in
hairspray kind of the back of my hair so
I get more volume so yeah that's the end
of this video and I hope you all enjoyed
I said I think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
