be all about how I make my custom
thumbnails because I get so many
questions on Michelle how do you make
your thumbnails how do you add text how
do you blah blah blah blah I'm just
playing like a hoodie and the Lighting's
really bad in my room today just because
it's cloudy outside so but I don't
really think it matters because I'm just
gonna be filming my screen anyway so you
do have to have one app to do one thing
that I do but I mean you can probably
find something online I've really been
taking advantage of having custom
thumbnails and all the partner benefits
so since I can make custom thumbnails I
really like to edit them and make them
look nice because it's fun I'm so OCD
about my thumbnails now it's not even
funny so a lot of people have been
noticing that and just wondering how I
make them so I'm gonna get into my
laptop and check out after you have your
picture imported onto your laptop I just
put mine in the desktops as easy and I'm
opening this app called pic frame plus
it's about two dollars or so on the mac
apple store but it is really cool drag
my clips over and for the purpose of
this i just chose to random pictures so
yeah so i can pick any of these little
collages down here so i'm just going to
pick a random one and do this one and
then you can like drag around and move
your picture to how you want it to be
I'm just going to click Save in the top
corner and save it as thumbnail ok so
now about that safe i'm just going to go
onto internet and how i edit my pictures
I go to I just type in an online photo
editor and I go to pixlr.com it should
be like the first one that comes up and
those three different choices you can go
to I like to go to the efficient one and
then this comes up and you're going to
click browse and then go to the
thumbnail you created so now you have
your frame thing so I'm gonna add an
effect I'm just going to go to effects
you can also go to adjustment and do all
of these if you want to i'm gonna go to
effect and they have all these different
effects and i'm going to just i usually
go to subtle cuz i like these ones i
think they're pretty
to Ingrid account Ingrid we're gonna and
then just click apply I like to go to
text now this is like the biggest thing
people ask me how do I get texts on my
clips i usually do the handwritten ones
and then I go to font and then you can
go through all these different fonts and
pick the ones you want I typically do
like a different one every time so I'm
going to do linky and then you can type
your text in here so i'm going to put
thumbnail and you can like make it
bigger so put it there and then change
the color so I typically just do black
though black or white and then you just
click apply and then go to say in the
top left corner and then save it so that
is how I make my thumbnails I hope you
guys enjoyed this and try it out if you
can do custom thumbnails I'm not really
sure if everybody can do that I thought
it was only for partners but I think now
everybody could have to custom
thumbnails I'm not really sure but and
i'll see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
