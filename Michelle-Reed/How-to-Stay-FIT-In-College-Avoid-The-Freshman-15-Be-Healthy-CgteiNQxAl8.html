video all about how to stay fit in
college so I'm getting a sophomore next
year in college and I know you guys are
probably all going back to school and I
know there's a lot of stuff that talks
about like the Freshman Fifteen might be
scared of loosing healthy habits and so
today's video I'm just gonna share with
you guys kind of easier tips of little
things to do that you can stay healthy
in college but still have a ton of fun I
am NOT a diet expert I am NOT a health
expert I'm not even gonna be talking
about food that much in this video here
named my channel my name is Michelle at
the post beauty fashion lifestyle videos
and also a lot of college videos right
now cuz I'm going back to college
I'm so excited let me know down below if
you are going into college what school
you're going to or also what grade
you're going into I would love to hear
number one would be to make sure that
you're drinking a ton of water this is
something that I did not do very well I
drink so much iced coffee guys it's so
bad I would just like get through the
damn it oh my gosh I've had like two
sips of water today and I haven't had
anything else and so I would recommend
bringing water with you to class I
really like the Starbucks cups that have
the straw those are the only cups that I
find I can really like drink a lot of
water and just make sure you stay
hydrated because in college you're gonna
be so busy and if you don't have that
hydration it's gonna be a lot harder to
do school do you would be to actually
walk to class I go to school in New York
as most of you guys know I feel like I
said that never single video so I walk
everywhere and I feel like that's
probably the main reason why I was able
to stay healthier is because I did walk
and toured UT and oh my gosh guys it was
so big trying to walk to class even if
it's hot outside I'm just wearing your
workout clothes and get a workout in I
know this can be like two miles for some
people number three is probably my
favorite thing and that would be to do
hit workouts in your dorm or you're
perfect you're basically high-intensity
interval training workouts are about
like thirty minutes that you can do in
your apartment and they're so so good
for you guys I know you don't always
have time to go to the gym like I barely
went to the gym my freshman year of
college because I just didn't I get on
the subway and go there
just kind of a lot of work I love doing
hit workouts I'll have a few of them
linked down below I'm also going to
include one in this video it's actually
a PopSugar one but if you guys want to
see me doing it I will cue it right here
so for my hit workouts I like to do each
of them for 45 seconds with a 15 second
rest in between so I like to start off
with these side runs and then these high
knees where you basically just lift your
knees up pretty high and then just some
normal runs trying to kick your butt and
then these side squats where you kind of
step to the side and do a quick little
shuffle over to the side and then after
I'm done with the side squats I do these
frog jumps or you basically just jump
over and kind of touch your toes I kind
of did it a couple of these and I also
know my knees are a little bit above my
toes so don't do that and then I like to
do these side lunges making sure that
you get as low as possible and really
squatting far back and then I just do
some simple mountain climbers and then I
will repeat a circuit and do this one
which is basically just high knees and
then jumping jacks and then after that I
go a little crazy and do these jumping
jacks into a squat which looks so funny
but trust me they work your inner thighs
guys and they make you soar and then I
like to do these step ups where you
basically go with the opposite hand and
step back up repeatedly and they're kind
of tricky to get used to it I don't even
think of doing them completely right in
this video but they really do hurt and
then I do these downward dog push up
jacks I went down on my knees because
I'm bad at jumping jacks or not jumping
jacks push-ups but if you are gonna push
ups just do normal ones I'm just a
little bit weak in the arms and then I
like to do these jump lunges these are
actually like some of my favourite ones
I just think they feel so good if you do
them repeatedly really making sure you
get super high off the ground and going
really low into your lunge and then I
like to do elbow planks or you basically
just walk up and down repeatedly these
really work your shoulders and then I do
side plank pulses which also really work
your obliques and then I also have this
hit workout that I love I do these tuck
touches or you basically just go back
and forth touching your toes up and then
after the Tuck touches I like to do
these downward dog push-ups which you
basically just go up in a downward dog
pose and then do a push-up again you can
do regular push-ups as you're good at
them
just not skilled in that area and then I
like to do squat jumps three basically
just try to squat low and do a little
jump in between and then after my squat
jumps I just like to do these lay down
sit-ups where you kind of do a Russian
twist and then lay down these also are
great to do with the medicine ball if
you have one on hand and I like to do
these gate swings where you basically
just go down put your knees and jump and
go back up I also love jogging whenever
I have time I really like running I find
it also really works to get some cardio
in and if you find some stairs I
definitely would recommend just running
up and down stairs because I love to do
that as well that was one of my favorite
workouts to do it felt so good I could
do it in my tiny little shoebox
apartment but those are really really
great if you want to get in a quick
workout but you don't have a ton of time
to actually work out therefore would be
to always keep healthy snacks with you I
would get so hungry in college and I
just really like snacking I love healthy
snacks so I would always have like
apples and peanut butter or pretzels or
trail mix inter studying a lot chances
are you gonna get super hungry and if
you actually have snacks like on hand
you're much more likely to just eat
those and go like grab a thing of fries
which I'm not saying is awful to do like
a few times a week but if you're doing
this like every single day it can like
lead you to gain weight and it can lead
you to start getting like unhealthy
habits a lot of you guys might disagree
with this one but it would be to not
scroll through Instagram Fitness account
I know you probably see these on yours
so everybody don't Instagram I don't
know why they're always on the discovery
page it's like I don't know what this in
my life I guess that Fitness accounts
can be really inspiring and for some
people they've work and that's you like
that's totally okay I know for a lot of
girls in college you're probably busy
between like school having a job
internships and like I got Fitness
accounts as these people are literally
only working out like that is their job
they're personal trainers their job is
Instagram and so yeah they're gonna have
the whole day they like geared towards
healthy eating and looking good a
good Instagram picture making sure their
meals are perfect but like for the
majority of us that's just not the case
and we don't have that time in college
so don't compare yourself to these
Instagram accounts now for a lot of
people this really helps but I just know
there's so many girls who sit there
scrolling through these accounts feeling
insecure about their bodies especially
in college you know all the time a
workout
like that dad you should be focusing on
just having a healthy lifestyle
and get off your phone like don't scroll
through Instagram I'm gonna look like
this Victoria's Secret model but it's
like homeboy you're in college you don't
be a little thing Victoria's Secret
model number six it's also one my
favorites I would be to do your own
grocery shopping even if you have a meal
plan like having like a few healthy
things in your dorm just but always make
me feel better
grocery shopping is like me at my prime
let's get yourself a coffee I know I
just said did not drink coffee
get yourself a green tea doesn't feel
like bring one of your girlfriends with
you it could be a ton of fun grocery
shopping
I know grocery shopping always gets me
really excited to eat healthy and it
just like feels really fresh and I
really recommend it and number seven
would be it's working out and being
healthy it's actually something that's
really important to you and you know to
be more important than like a social
life or like school even then prioritize
it don't for a lot of college kids like
this isn't gonna be at the top of the
list and that's fine but I feel like and
you actually want to make it something
that happens you have to prioritize it
be sure you can fit in a workout make
you sure you can fit in a healthy meal
because that's the only way that you're
actually gonna make a change in college
let me know down below what your best
tip is for those going into college and
wanting to stay healthy
wanting to stay fit I would love it we
can all just help each other out in this
video this could just be a place for
positivity not to shame anyone let's
others up because that's always the
goals of my videos also if you watched
my last video right here and all some of
my other college related videos linked
