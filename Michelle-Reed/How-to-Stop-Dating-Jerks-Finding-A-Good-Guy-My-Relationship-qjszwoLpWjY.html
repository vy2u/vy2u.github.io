hear these stories of girls who are
dating these guys who are constantly
putting them down who are manipulative
who are using them who are using their
bodies and it tears me apart and it
makes my heart hurt hey guys today's
video is going to be a little bit
something different I feel like I've
been doing a lot of videos that are
great and all but not really why I
started this channel out of a little bit
of a girl talk I want to talk a lot
about dating today this isn't a Q&amp;amp;A and
it asked for questions or anything I
have just seen so many people in my life
recently having so many issues with
relationships and knowing their worth
and dating in general and so I thought
that today I would just sit down and
talk to you guys about my advice
regarding dating I mean a guy that is
worth your time it is 2017 and we are
far too busy to waste our time dating
jerks and so today's video is going to
be about how to stop dating jerks and
I'm going to be talking about 10 things
that I think that you should personally
look for a guy this point of my life if
you don't know who I am my name is
Michelle Reid and I have been dating my
boyfriend Eden for about a year and a
half and you guys are probably like
thinking he's this mystery guy because I
don't necessarily put him in a lot of my
videos and that is just because I
learned after having a public
relationship that my relationship is
something that I want to keep extremely
private I share some things on my
Instagram who wanna follow me it's at
Michelle Rhee so many things that he has
taught me that I've learned through him
for the way that he treats me from the
way that I treat him and from the times
that I don't treat him nicely if you're
watching this feel free to grab a cup of
coffee like myself and keep watching for
star this video I want to ask you guys
to go down below and comment what is the
most important trait in a guy that you
vote for because I think that is first
instrumental before dating to know what
your standards are and what you actually
look for the first quality that I think
is so extremely important when finding a
boyfriend or someone that you
potentially want to date is someone who
prioritizes you if you know me you
probably know I'm not someone who is
into casual dating and if you are that's
completely fine I just want to be
upfront that this might not be the best
being gonna find advice from I'm almost
twenty which I know is still young but I
don't want to waste my time dating
someone who I don't seem a future with
someone who only wants me whenever he
wants me someone who's not in it for the
long haul and someone who doesn't
actually commit because I can do so so
much damage to you trust me I think it's
so important that you're dating someone
that has other things that he's looking
towards in terms of ambition but I want
to be important in this guy's life I
want him to make sure he's doing things
that show commitment to me number two is
kind of cliche but I think it's so
important that it's someone who you
trust again I think Trust is a word that
we kind of know what it means but we
don't exactly know what it means I know
this person's heart I know this person's
mind and I know that he is going to say
no to things and he is going to say yes
to things with integrity you watched my
videos as well you know that I'm a
Christian and there are certain moral
guidelines that I follow that I would
want my boyfriend or my spouse or my
fiancee whatever your insert partner is
for this video to be on the same page
with three I'm gonna date someone who
actually tells me when there's a problem
and by this I mean we are not dating
people who are passive-aggressive I'm
gonna be honest this is something that I
struggle with I have my days where I am
passive-aggressive I'm not saying I
expect the person that I'm dating to
never actually be passive-aggressive at
all but I don't know about you guys but
it is so attractive whatever you're
dating someone and they actually tell
you hey look this is bothering me that
you're doing this and we're gonna talk
through it and we're gonna come to a
solution like how would sure and how
responsible is that and I know something
you guys are probably watching this in
your college and you're like Michelle
that's great but where are these guys
that you are talking about I just want
to say that they actually exists there
are guys who aren't passive-aggressive
there are guides who want to confront a
problem and fix it because
you so much and they want this
relationship to laugh I don't want
someone who leaves when things get hard
I don't want someone who flees the first
time that he feels a little bit
uncomfortable because things aren't
super lovey and super passionate number
four I want someone who has goals if you
are dating someone who it's never
working hard who is failing his classes
maybe it's a rough part of his life and
I understand that but if that behavior
persists over the long term
I really value work and I think it's so
attractive when someone has the ambition
to work hard and use his talents that
God has given him for a greater benefit
and not necessarily working to make a
million dollars but working because he
loves working and he knows that his body
is made to do good things in the world
like how attractive is that yeah there
are days when I'm lazy other days when
your significant other is going to be a
little bit lazy but if that is behavior
that is over the long term like don't
date this person number five is someone
who is proud to be your boyfriend or
your girlfriend if you're dating someone
who is constantly talking to his friends
about how you're being annoying or who
constantly tells his friends that you're
pestering him you should be with someone
who is so happy to be dating you who
tells his friends whenever you're doing
really cool things what someone says
whenever you're not there says so much
more than what he says whenever you are
there and number six is someone who
treats others kindly as well if you're
someone who only really treats you
nicely but is rude to the waiter or the
waitress or is rude to his mom that is
someone that you should have be dating
again people have bad days again people
are grumpy but if you're is someone who
is constantly taking out his aggression
on other people soon enough you are
going to be that person and you may not
see it now you may see it in ten years
when you're married if a guy doesn't
mean
to his mother the woman who gave him
like that is a red flag and I think that
you should drop it because our mamas are
important and we want guys who want to
give their moms because that's probably
a sign that they're gonna value you in
the long run to number seven again I
already said this but I'm a Christian
and so I want a guy who loves Jesus just
as much as I do that's important that's
not something that I'm willing to skimp
on there are so many things that are
underlying this that are so important
especially for me if I want a long-term
relationship with someone he needs to
know that all of this world and all of
the things that he accomplishes and that
he does are not by his will but they're
by a greater good number eight is
someone who encourages you this I think
is probably one of the most important
things in this video because
encouragement is essential I have days
where I feel so discouraged with YouTube
I have days where I feel so discouraged
with my grades and Eden is always the
person that I can turn to and I know
that he is gonna tell me that like this
is just one of those days and I'm gonna
get past it and that I am better than
this and I'm better than the negative
thoughts in my mind and if you have a
guy who is not telling you that
obviously they're gonna be days when
he's not going to maybe it's a bad day
then that's totally fine I understand
that your significant other should push
you to be better he should push you to
be the person that he knows that you are
because he probably knows you pretty
well and number nine I want someone who
can make me laugh I have such an odd
sense of humor guys there are just times
when I say things and I'm like that was
a really bad thing that I just said but
he is always the one who's like yeah I
get it I'm gonna laugh at it even if it
wasn't that funny you don't have to feel
like you have to censor yourself with a
person that you're dating obviously you
shouldn't be saying bad things all the
time but if you just say something
that's kind of quirky kind of
embarrassing you don't want to date
someone who's gonna be like wow that was
weird
number nine is someone who truly loves
me and isn't just infatuated with me
what I mean by that is there is such a
big difference between infatuation and
love a saturation is kind of being in
love with the image of someone but
loving is actually loving who would that
person truly
inside and out beyond just you know
their physical appearance I think it's
really easy to indicate when you're in
love with the idea of someone versus
when you're actually in love with the
person because when you're actually in
love with the person even when they have
bad days you're still gonna see them and
be like yeah I really love this person
but when you're just infatuated with
someone the minute that they drop that
image up they have in your head you're
gonna be like who is this person that
I'm dating and I can tell you that the
real love is so so so much better and
number ten this is also probably one of
the most important things but that is
someone who loves my family I got a big
family and I love them more than anyone
my family everyone every single sibling
I have with my parents are my best
friends I love them so much and I can
never date someone who doesn't enjoy me
around my family who doesn't fit with
the family I mean obviously if you were
gonna be different and they're not gonna
fit it perfectly because they weren't
born in your family obviously but I want
someone who can kick it with my sisters
and with my brothers and my parents and
it'd be cool obviously living in New
York City and dating even here in New
York City if you don't get to be around
our families that much but the times
that we do it's just so sweet like
seeing your significant other with your
family shouldn't scare you it should
make you happy that you have two worlds
that are colliding and I can get such a
beautiful thing then that happens if the
person that you're dating is constantly
uncomfortable around your family or who
talks badly about your family to red
flags that you should stop dating this
person and stop dating jerks so those
are the ten things I personally look for
in a guy and I just want to say at the
end of this video if you're dating
someone who is not making you feel
worthy who's not bringing you joy
throughout the day you don't see
yourself potentially being with for the
long term I have a question if that's a
relationship that you
be in I don't mean that lightly you are
far too precious to waste your time
dating guys who are jerks who are making
you feel worthless I feel like I'm gonna
cry but I just hear these stories of
girls who are dating these guys who are
constantly putting them down who are
manipulative who are using them who are
using their bodies and it tears me apart
and it makes my heart hurt because that
is not what we're called to do find the
good ones they are out there and maybe
you're searching in the back place or
maybe you're searching too much maybe
you're trying too hard to afford
something that isn't actually there give
her any questions feel free to DM me on
Instagram I have been responding to a
lot more DMS than usual and just really
trying to connect with you guys because
I feel like you're my sisters and I want
to hook you out so it'll be linked down
below if you want to try on my Instagram

next video I'm pretty sure it's going to
be a college making my life so check it
