to be doing a clothing haul for you guys
because I bought some fall clothes
wanted to show them to you guys so I
decided to record this this is also a
try on haul because I hate when people
are hauling clothes and they hold
something up and you're like I can't
even tell what that looks like like that
is just a Miss shaped article of
clothing so I decided to film what they
actually looks like on my body so you
can get a better picture of the clothes
and if you're not already subscribed you
should definitely do that right now the
button will be right here it's also down
below as always so definitely do that
and let's go ahead and get into the
video so first we're going to start with
PacSun I got a couple skirts first this
one is just a gray kind of knit skirt
and it just goes down a little bit below
the knee or above the knee I kind of
forgot when I put it on but I really
really like this I might wear this at my
senior pictures I just thought it looks
really cute and it was very flattering
so I decided to pick that up
this was also a clearance item and all
the clearance items are buy one get
three free so I also got three other
things I got the same exact skirt in
this mer-moon
color just in case you know I felt like
wearing this one instead so literally
the same just a really pretty kind of
purply maroon and then I couldn't really
find two other things that I liked so I
just picked out random tank tops didn't
even try them on this one is just a
cream cropped one pretty soft I mean
it's a summer item because it's
clearance but I figured I could throw a
jacket over it maybe and make it fall
then I got this one which is just kind
of a halter tank top and it goes down
and it's pretty cropped and not really
my style I just couldn't find anything
and I was really like getting hot and
PacSun because it was really really hot
in there there's a lot of people so I
kind of just picked this out I don't
really like it but maybe I can like give
it to someone on them also from PacSun I
got this necklace it's just a gold long
necklace and it has a little crystal in
it I've been really into long necklaces
lately for some reasons and I also got a
little earring set this just has kind of
some turquoise ones arrows triangle ones
that are wearing right now
and I just really enjoy switching on my
earrings because I have a double
piercing and so I decided to get these
and then I went to forever 21 and I got
this crop top which is so pretty it's
like this orange suede crop top and it's
just kind of a tank top style and has a
zipper in the back and I love the color
on this it's so pretty this is literally
full in shirt form I just think it's so
cute it looks really cute with a grey
skirt so I might wear them together I
might know you guys should let me know
if you like it then I got this shirt
which is so me it says the best things
in life are free the second best happen
to be very expensive which is so true
because I have a taste for expensive
things unfortunately but I got this it's
really big they only had a large and so
it's kind of long but I figured you know
maybe I could just wear this as an
oversized tee where it's a bed I don't I
just thought it's really cute then I
also got this sweatpants that I'm
wearing right now they're just like grey
jogger sweatpants and they have a little
drawstring and they're super comfortable
and they were only 15 dollars and I've
worn them for the past three days
straight not even ashamed and so I
really like these I also ordered a few
things from brandy melville I got this
shirt which is just kind of an oversized
grey long-sleeve tee it's a v-neck super
comfy I love these shirts I wear these
all the time and I just think they're
nice to wear with like jeans and boots
I've even got this shirt which just
looks like they're like child shirts
they're like tiny but this one is maroon
and it has really fine blue stripes in
it a little collar so I like this it's
like $15 it's just cute pair of jeans I
got this very chunky knit sweater it's
just a maroon color and it's literally
so chunky and thick and I'm not gonna
lie guys this is actually kind of itchy
not like this super itchy really oh my
gosh I need to take this off but just
ever so slightly itchy that it drives me
crazy so I don't know I might wear
something underneath this because kind
of uncomfortable to wear alone but it's
cute so like I say and pretty much all
my videos beauty is pain then I know
this olive green shirt which I actually
have in maroon but I wear it
all the time so I decided to pick up
this one so it's just all green and it's
really long short sleeve just a nice
basic shirts only problem I ironed this
right after I got it and didn't wash it
and for some reason it left this huge
like Mark Steyn thing in the front which
kind of looks like a pretzel so yeah so
that's kind of annoying but I mean it
kind of looks like it's meant to be that
way so we're gonna pretend that didn't
happen
I placed an order on Urban Outfitters
and for some reason one of the things
came early and then all the other things
aren't supposed to come until a couple
of days but I mean to get this film so I
don't have those things but I got this
shirt which is a really pretty just date
Eve flowy blouse so it has a little
button in the front and it's kind of
three-quarter lengths and then it goes
pretty long this is on sale and so I
love Urban Outfitters sale items they're
awesome and so pick this up and then I
got some choice clothing items which I
love choice it's basically just this
international website that I get a lot
of stuff from so I'll have it linked
down below if you want to check it out
but I got this jacket which I love
choice jackets are so good I'd
definitely recommend buying one it's
just a very large oversized jean jacket
it's like a nice light Sandom color it
has gold buttons and collar and I love
this so much I love this it actually had
a really ugly patch on it and so I
pulled it off but it kind of looks like
it's meant to be that way you know so I
think it's definitely essential to have
a nice warm jacket for the vault I'm
also picked up this sweater it's a nice
oatmeal color and it has the frets and
then it was a black vamp on the bottom
just a really simple sweater and I have
a pretty simple style so this definitely
looks good in my wardrobe and you guys
knew how I said in a couple videos back
I really wanted a blanket scarf and so I
found this one on choice and it's really
really soft it's just like a plaid
blanket scarf and it's awesome and it
makes me so happy I really really love
this it's gonna be great for what it
gets really cool more like the
wintertime and I can just bundle up from
j.crew I got this shirt which is just a
plaid button-down shirt and
it is blue and bread and white so very
simple but I love putting these
underneath sweaters and having the
caller's peek out I think it's really
cute I also got this cardigan which is
just a gray sweater cardigan and
literally the only reason why I bought
this is because my church is freezing
and I always need something to throw up
I never have something cute to wear when
I'm cold and so I think this would do
just that it's like a cute sweater but
it keeps you warm so and then there's a
store called altered state which I don't
know if they have those outside of Texas
as they may but they have really cute
kind of like southern clothes and so I
got two pairs of socks these are the
boot socks that you wear and so the suck
parts right here and then this cream
part sticks out so you can like fold it
over wear it under riding boots they're
super cute and then I also got this gray
kind of sweater pair I don't think of be
able to put these over my jeans but
they'll definitely keep my feet warm
under my boots because then you're
getting cold in Texas I know it's hot
but it gets a little chilly sometimes so
that's everything that I have to show
you guys if you guys have picked up
anything for fall that you love let me
know I'm always looking out for videos
