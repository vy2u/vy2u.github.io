I have not ever done and I'm really
excited for I'm gonna be going a week
without wearing any makeup and I'm gonna
be documenting it here today's Monday so
it's the next day so today is Wednesday
is Friday day six other reason I did
this is because I am someone who really
enjoys putting on makeup putting on
makeup is super therapeutic for me I
basically wear makeup every day I don't
think it's bad to wear makeup every day
and I also don't think it's bad to not
wear makeup every day typically go maybe
like two days a week of not wearing
makeup but I never go an entire week
especially when I have things going on I
always like to put on makeup it's also
really relaxing for me so I honestly
really like it I'm not doing this
because I think makeup is bad I just
want to see what it's like to not wear
it throughout the week I want to see if
a my skin improves I want to see it be
my confidence is better and I want to
see it see I get more stuff done because
I'm not spending time doing my makeup so
right now this is me without makeup I
want to start this video by saying a few
of my insecurities kind of want this to
be inspiring to show you guys that I too
have insecurities and this is gonna be
kind of a challenge for me a few of my
insecurities one my skin has been pretty
rough the past two weeks I don't have
huge pimples or anything but I've been
having all these bumps on my forehead
and then I also have like pimples on my
cheek I also have really dark under-eye
circles I sleep fine but for some reason
just genetically I have always had like
dark under eyes and that's something
that I'm so insecure about probably like
my biggest insecurity and also obviously
as you can see I'm like pretty pale I
self tan so my face is so much lighter
than my body but I would definitely
recommend you guys to try this out to me
on Instagram if you do or tag me in a
comment down below and also for this
video leave down below what the number
one thing is that makes me feel
confident so I feel I can be really
interesting to see how you guys feel
about this as well so yeah let's go
ahead and get right into this challenge
the today's Monday just got ready which
took literally ten minutes all I did was
treat my hair and put on some
moisturizer I'm feeling pretty good
at Q I'm actually going to get breakfast
with my friend Rose and I usually really
like like getting ready for stuff like
that taking cute pictures with her which
I can still do obviously but it's weird
like not putting
make up and just going and doing that
with her so since I have a lot of extra
time I'm gonna go ahead and start
working on some video stops it's the
next day and I woke up with such a big
pimple I didn't think that would happen
after not wearing makeup but it is what
it is
yesterday it was so nice just going to
work out and just not having to take off
your makeup before you go and today I
only have a short amount of time and
between he-man I have to do something
and when I get home but I can so just go
and work out so I'm not gonna have to
like do eye makeup or anything so I'm
actually really excited I think it's
gonna be a good day first day two of no
makeup right now I'm on my way to go
ship out some Poshmark
orders but I posted this picture on
Instagram on my Instagram story and I
was like now we're gonna make up and
feeling super fresh and you guys were
all so nice I had so many DMS of people
just be like but surely you're so
naturally beautiful and pretty and it
made me feel really good so I just
wanted to say thank you you guys for
being so sweet I'm excited to go tonight
to church too that's my update so
today's Wednesday it is day three of no
makeup and today I'm here with my sister
for an interview and we actually had to
leave at 7:00 because it was in Dallas
so we had to like commute and and so I'd
wake up really early but it's so nice
because usually have to make up like an
hour early to get ready but I literally
got up 15 minutes before didn't put on
makeup just there on my outfit and
everything and it was so quick and so I
really like getting this no makeup thing
I feel like the more that I go on each
day the more that I like today's Friday
it is day five of a no makeup yesterday
I didn't record a clip but I do have a
picture of proof if you want to see that
yes I did not indeed wear makeup today I
want to see I'm gonna time how long it
takes me to actually get ready because
all I'm gonna do is my hair and then
like put on chapstick to see how much
time I save and don't worry makeup got
my phone right here yep
so I just finished getting ready and I
look to the clock and y'all it literally
took 5 minutes and 28 seconds for me to
get ready I also want to say that I laid
out yesterday if I'm looking a little
bit Tanner that's it I'm so gonna start
doing this more because I like my time
and I know you guys probably do too so
it is day 6 I think of a dumb Bank up
and I'm coming to you alive
we just laid outside which is really
nice I just put on some sunscreen so I
didn't damage my skin but I'm feeling
really good I honestly am loving this
this so I'm gonna be doing more is just
so nice like going day to day being able
to go work out come back get ready fast
and just get going I really like it and
I'm feeling really good so guys it is
the last day of my week of no makeup and
I kind of wanted to finish this video
off talking about my thoughts answering
the three things that I was kind of
hoping would happen and kind of my
general experience so my first question
was if my confidence would improve I
would say that I definitely was so much
more confident this week first couple of
days it is weird not wearing makeup and
kind of like going to regular things and
seeing people around in your town but
generally throughout the week it kind of
just became something that I was used to
and I kind of woke up and I was like
okay this is what's gonna happen go on
with my day and it was really quite nice
I feel like my confidence wasn't really
rooted in how I looked which is really
nice and refreshing I also was wondering
if my skin would improve and I
definitely think the first few days my
skin did not improve my skin was the
exact same I actually got a huge pimple
on my cheek obviously that went away and
my skin has gotten a lot better towards
the end I feel like my skin is breaking
out a whole lot less I do work out a lot
so my face is pretty sweaty a lot and so
I think that's why my skin generally
breaks out whatever I am not wearing
makeup but it definitely still improves
which was nice my third thing was if I
would have more time and guys I have
never had so much more time if you
multiply it like say you take 20 minutes
in the morning to do your makeup
twenty minutes seven days a week that is
what 140 minutes that you spend on doing
your makeup you multiply that throughout
the month if you multiply that
throughout the year that's so much time
Bente doing your makeup even just having
that extra 20 minutes in the day really
did help I want to end this by saying
that I know this is really normal for a
lot of you guys a lot of you guys might
be laughing like Glee this girl thinking
she's so cool not wearing makeup but
obviously this is something that I don't
do and this was a really good challenge
for me and I would definitely challenge
you guys to do it as well if you do try
this out make sure to tag me on
Instagram or just let me know in a
comment down below make sure to
subscribe if you're new and I will see
you guys in my next video bye friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
