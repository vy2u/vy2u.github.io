love spring tag video I don't really
remember if i was tagged by anybody
specifically so if you did tag me thank
you but i'm just gonna go ahead and do
this because i thought it looked like a
fun video also i'm in my sister's room
if you can't tell i just wanted to film
in here because i've been really tired
of my setup lately but really quickly
say i'm really sorry i haven't been
uploading too frequently lately this is
a really busy time for me right now the
end of april but once the end of april
is over i promise i will have many more
videos and many more like creative
videos than just like sitting down and
filming the first question is your
favorite spring nail polish mine is not
here so mine would be as these cute as a
button it's a nice just corally pink
shade and honestly just any quarrels my
favorite shade for spring i love coral i
feel like it makes you look a lot tanner
and it's just a nice bright color Oh
number two is what is your must-have lip
color for spring and I would definitely
be revlon's Raspberry Pi I've worn this
all throughout winter as well but it's
just my favorite lip color right now I
love it pink lips don't really look that
good on me so a raspberry color
definitely suits my skin tone better I
feel like it's also nice and
moisturizing Cesana lipstick is just a
nice moisturizing balm number three is
show us your favorite spring dress and I
would definitely be this kind of white
lace one it is from target I'm so it's
just short sleeve and it's basically
just all white lace and it looks like
this absolutely love this dress because
it is very simple so you can dress it
any way you want no biting gets good you
can basically dress this like any way
you want because it's so simple so you
can kind of do whatever you want with it
and I really love this dress and it is
from target number four is what is your
favorite spring flower and mine is a
gerber daisy i love gerber daisies

will insert a picture somewhere around
here but I love them and I love all
colors i just really like gerber daisies
so number five is what is your favorite
spring Skaar slash accessory and i
really don't have any favorite of spring
accessories so i'm just gonna do a scarf
and it looks like this it's just pink
and it's literally floral I showed this
in my scarf collection but it's an
infinity scarf and it has like all these
different really pretty color flowers in
it and its really awesome
I said light for spring as well it's not
like a big chunky scarf for winter and
yeah I really love it so 6 is what
spring trends are you most excited about
this year and honestly I don't know the
trends um for makeup I guess it's just
brighter cheat colors i really like um
wearing like a brighter blush color in
spring fashion I guess just wearing
bright colors and also wearing shorts my
favorite shorts are like the j.crew
chino shorts and i also love wearing
high waisted pattern short so pattern
shorts yeah definitely so number 7 is
what is your favorite spring candle so I
would definitely be Caribbean escape
from Bath and Body Works or likes Latin
encode i think is what school but i love
this candle it's definitely a very
beachy said just kind of smells like
fruit and pineapple and like hawaiian
fruits I guess fruits are Hawaiian but
smell so wine okay creamy coconut milk
raw sugar cane and a touch of sweet
casaba probably said that wrong but you
know what well so number 8 is what is
your favorite body spray / perfume for
spring and so I only have a body story
but it is the pink fresh vanillas dream
on I love this stuff it would really
reminds me of when I went to El Paso
with my friend Evelyn because I bought
this there but it smells really really
sweet and it's nice and vanilla I love
vanilla scents for spring and it just
reminds me of summer in a bottle so nine
asked what is spring like where you live
and spring where I live is obviously
really hot I live in a pretty hot area
and we don't really get along spring
basically go straight in the summer so
it's pretty hot like in the 80s to 90s
in springtime like today it's 90 degrees
and i'm wearing shorts and I'm really
happy tent is what is your favorite
thing about spring so um you know it's
closer dating school out which is nice I
honestly don't like spring school wise
because it's when I have all my testing
and no juegue set testing an Impala
jennandpaul I like new clothes
shopaholic probs I just like new clothes
I like seeing spring look books that's
really exciting i really like watching
the spring look books here on youtube
and 11 asks if you are a spring cleaner
in which i would have to answer no i'm
not a spring clean or not really a
cleaner in general not a very clean
person for just staying the obvious here
for just be honest i'm not a spring
cleaner I don't know so 12 ask any plans
for an upcoming spring vacation or just
vacation in general
I'm not really going where I don't plan
on going anywhere I don't well it's kind
of boring right now so that is my I love
spring tag so I hope you guys all
