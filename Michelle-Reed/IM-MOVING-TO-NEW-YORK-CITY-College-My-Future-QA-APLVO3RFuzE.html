years and I've worked my butt off and
now that it's here I just I'm so excited
to do this video for you guys today
because we are just going to sit down
and talk and chat it's a QA I asked for
questions on my Instagram which is
Michelle Reid if you're wondering
definitely go follow me but if you like
I'm in a very pivotal moment of my life
and I talk a lot about my personal life
on my blog channel which is Michelle out
of her shell but as far as I main
channel goes I feel like we don't really
talk that much we don't really connect
and so I wanted to just sit down and
talk to you guys about some stuff that's
going on in my life and I take you guys
so we're gonna do that what is something
you're scared / nervous for when you go
to college and do you think it will be
difficult to go to college in New York
when you're so far from home I wanted to
start with this because I wanted to talk
about college and where I'm going I will
be in New York City next year for
college I'm not gonna say my exact
school just because I want to keep that
level of privacy but I will be there and
I'm so so unbelievably grateful and
excited I can't even express my feelings
about it I wanted to be there for the
past four years and I worked my butt off
and now that it's here I just I tried
out for a full scholarship I blogged the
experience so if you watched my blog
channel you probably sold up but I
didn't get the full scholarship I did
get some financial aid they only picked
four out of like 150 people and so I
didn't get it but I got enough to be
able to go which I'm so so entirely
grateful for but yeah I am so excited
and to answer your question so scared
about the actual school part of it like
the work and the classes just because
college is a lot different than high
school but I'm not really scared about
moving there I feel like I'm ready and
I've trained myself for this moment and
so I don't have any sort of nervous
feelings about that part just mostly
about the school part many people also
ask me what I'm majoring in and so I'm
majoring in business I've always had
kind of a dream / passion about maybe
opening up my own clothing store or
doing something in fashion marketing or
just marketing and so
doing business superstone I was actually
watching Danielle Murray's video and she
was talking about how she wanted to do
business and communications and some
people were just being so extremely
nasty they were talking about how oh
that's not reliable so many people do
that you're not gonna make any money
with that who are we to tell people that
what they're passionate about is wrong
and that they're not gonna succeed I
just can't believe there are people in
the world people living and breathing
who are willing to tell people that it's
just it astounds me and honestly I don't
care people think it's unreliable and I
don't care people think my dreams are
stupid because they're my dreams and
they're my passions and I'm gonna make
them happen if they're my passion I kind
of going along with that someone asked
what is one quote that I live by
it's definitely let the beauty of what
you love be what you do it's so simple
but it just explains kind of my outlook
on life that if you love something do it
make it a job make it a career make it
happen if you love it then you will be
able to make that happen and I know
that's not necessarily the most popular
opinion but it is mine and I've always
lived my life by that are you happy with
their life so far and did it turn out
the way you thought it would from being
younger my life is nowhere near what I
thought it would be when I was younger I
always thought I was gonna be this super
like social person with so many cool
friends and just always surround myself
with people it's actually quite the
opposite I'm very independent
I only trust a few people I don't open
up to people very quickly and that's
something that I was always very
self-conscious about something that was
always a really big insecurity of mine
but this year I've just finally embraced
that that's how I am that's who I am and
I'm done
putting myself down for that when it's
just a matter of I'm not how I thought I
would be my life is so much better than
I thought it was gonna be though I never
imagined I would be at this place and
I'm just so content with everything I'm
so content with where I am and who I am
and it's such a great place to meet many
people also ask about my hair color my
hair cut which I haven't even talked
about on this channel it didn't cut off
quite a bit of hair guys I used up hair
like it down to my waist not on my waist
like down to my hips and I cut a lot off
and I went blonder I did balayage and I
loved it I'm so happy with how it turned
out it's so much more manager
I would definitely recommend chopping
off a little bit of your hair once you
get all the dead ends off it feels so
good and I'm so happy about it any good
book recommendations recently I've been
reading this book called reclaiming
conversation the power of talk and a
digital age by sherry Turkle have it
linked down below but I love this book
I'm so tired of this age of social media
where we don't know how to talk in
person and we neglect people because we
don't know how to talk to them and it's
a problem like any problem though it can
be fixed and there is a solution so I've
been reading this almost to teach myself
how to talk to people again and how to
stop always being on my phone I'm only
about 100 pages in or so but it's like a
thick credo but it's really really good
and it's important and I honestly think
in this age of technology and social
media everyone should read this because
you don't want to lose the skill of
valuing people and valuing face-to-face
conversations how did you know what you
wanted to do in college take a look at
your spare time and look at what you do
look at whenever you don't have comm
work whenever you don't have sports what
you enjoy doing and I feel like that's
ultimately what you should pursue as a
career whether that be you like to write
in your free time or edit videos or film
or run or jog I feel like that's what
you should be doing because it shows to
willing to spend your extra time to that
thing and so that's what I did and I saw
I won really enjoy looking at fashion
blogs I really enjoy putting outfits
together and B I really really enjoy
entrepreneurship and starting new
businesses and coming up with new
thoughts and so I put the two together
and that's what I figured out I want to
do that any confidence tips I can say
that on my youtube channel I always
talked about how I was confident and how
I didn't care what people thought about
me but I didn't reach that point until a
few months ago I'm almost 18 and it just
now took this long for me to be
completely a hundred percent confident
myself I always used to want to be
accepted by people I wanted people to
like me to like how I dress liked what I
said liked my conversations and then I
took a step back
and I thought why in the world am i
putting so much effort into wanting to
be liked when I don't even like these
people I don't like the conversations
we're having I can't agree with anything
I don't feel good or on them I don't
feel like they're benefiting me as a
person I just straight-up don't like
them so why am I trying to impress them
and that's when I realized that I didn't
need their opinions I didn't need their
approval because I was happy with who I
was and I was happy with my own thoughts
I stopped trying to please other people
I stopped trying to be liked stopped
trying to build this desire and myself
that wasn't even there in the first
place and I think that's when you really
reach the point that you are confident
in that you don't need other people what
would you say is the reason you love
fashion / what rule do you think it
plays in terms of confidence and self
definition I love this question I saw
that I was like I'm definitely answering
that this year especially I feel like
I've just really gotten into fashion and
started dressing for myself and dressing
the way that I want to be perceived
fashion is art and it shows your
creative side and it shows how you like
to express yourself and that's just such
a cool thing that we're able to do by
what we put on our body people would
always tell me you know Michelle why are
you dressing up so much for school show
why do you care so much what other
people think about you
hey I dress for myself and B I dress
this way because I like it it doesn't
matter if I'm at school or the gym well
kind of the gym but or the grocery store
or a mall I just dress how I want to
dress and I don't get why that's so hard
for people to grasp it's just its nature
for me like if I want to wear all black
like I'm weird today I'm gonna wear all
black because it makes me feel good and
that's just how fashion is for me and
who cares what other people think about
it so that's everything then I'm gonna
answer for this video I really hope you
guys enjoyed chatting with me because I
really enjoyed chatting with you guys
maybe read it till the end at this video
cuz I imagine it's gonna be a pretty
lengthy video give this video a like
because that would mean a lot to me if
you want to watch my last video it was
all about my spring outfits and my
favorite spring looks it was so much fun
to film and I'm really proud of that
video so you should definitely check it
out and I'll see you guys in my next
video bye friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
