because I felt like chatting with you
guys I asked your questions on my
Instagram because no offense to my
Twitter followers but Instagram is just
kind of beating you guys in the question
Department so for now on I think I'm
just gonna do a lot to Instagram so if
you want to follow me on there to be on
my next video that would be pretty
awesome let's just go ahead and get into
the question how long do I plan on doing
YouTube I'm not really sure how long I'm
gonna be doing YouTube I don't really
have like a set age or I'm going to stop
I'm just gonna keep doing it and so
though God stops allowing me to do it
and I hope that's for a while because I
really like it what do I want to study
in college now I mentioned this in
another video but I'm not really sure
what I want to do I'm thinking about
something in media or writing right now
but that could change cuz I'm not really
sure where do you see yourself in 15
years and where do you think you'll be
living in 15 years I will be 31 so I
don't even want to think about being 31
but hopefully I'll be living in New York
with the job and a husband that'd be
pretty awesome you know I can't really
tell I have always wanted to live in New
York City it's been a passion and kind
of dream of mine for so long and I'm
hoping to attend college there I'm
actually looking at colleges here soon
in the next few weeks so really excited
that's kind of a plan right now but I
could change but let's hope it doesn't
change beliefs about sex before marriage
you personally I do not want to have sex
before I'm married and I don't believe
in it I don't encourage it I just want
to save that for the may evaluate for
the rest of my life and I think that's
one way that keeps it special I know not
everybody shares my opinion on that and
you don't have to I'm not asking you to
but that's just kind of my opinion on
the matter what is your most
embarrassing moment now my most
embarrassing moment actually happened a
couple
to go and to set the scene I was
volunteering at a local dance where I
live it's like a daddy-daughter dance
and drove there but I don't really drive
that often so I don't have a ton of
experience cuz I don't have a car and I
get really stressed out in crowded areas
so whenever I parked in the beginning it
was really chill like there wasn't a lot
of people sounds okay but whenever I was
leaving the place it was actually super
crowded and I was very stressed out I am
not that good of the drivers so I was
pulling out and I was trying to get
there really fast I was kind of driving
through and I realized I was going the
wrong way because this was like a
one-way parking lot so quickly I just
whipped into a spot that was next to me
not really thinking about it and I was
so close to the car next to me there was
probably like a millimeter between me
another car that got there and I was
super stressed out I actually started
bawling I didn't know what to do I was
freaking out and I actually had to call
my dad to help me back out because I was
too close yeah that is one of the most
embarrassing moments of my life and I
haven't really told a lot of people that
so you guys know and you can laugh at me
all you want
describe your dream wedding I'm a pretty
traditional person so I definitely want
to get married in a church that's kind
of all I know I don't think I want
something huge
I just want close people but you know I
guess we'll have to see about that one
have you ever thought about leaving
Texas so like I said I do want to leave
Texas eventually and go to New York I
just want to try something different and
if I hate it I can always move back but
I do want to do it outside of Texas how
that Texas is bad I used to have this
mindset that I hated Texas for so long
but the people here are actually super
nice and that's something that you don't
really get everywhere so I do love Texas
but I think in life we should all try
something new so I do want to get out
eventually what is your philosophy that
you have learned over the years no this
is kind of a general question and I'm
just gonna say like my thoughts on life
I guess I think it's always been to just
do what I love and enjoy that despite
what other people say I thought a lot of
people say that what I do is really
stupid and dumb then that I should get a
real job but honestly I love doing
YouTube and I love reaching out to
people and that's something that makes
me so happy
before worrying about pleasing others
you should always be pleasing yourself
and be happy with the person that you
are and I can tell you that I'm happy
with who I am now and definitely not the
same person I was two years ago but
where I am now I am proud of that and I
think that's what my philosophy has
gotten me to be favorite Netflix show
right now it is definitely Gilmore Girls
I love me some Gilmore Girls let me know
if you watch it too because it's such
like a cute feel-good series that makes
me so happy what are your favorite
healthy foods now I actually don't eat
extremely healthy but lately I've been
loving bananas like bananas or my jam
how do you stay strong when people hate
on you I think you just have to root
your confidence in yourself and not
other people you can't let people's
opinions of you affect you because it
will tear you down because people are
mean and people are judgmental you just
got to know that your worth is not
placed in other people's opinions of you
and that your worth is in the person
that you are in the person you believe
you are because not everybody's gonna
like you I will tell you that right now
people are judgmental in your not gonna
be able to please everybody so my camera
actually cut out the outro of this video
what I really really hope you guys
enjoyed it I love chatting with you guys
make sure you go watch my last video and
also follow me on Twitter and in Syria
because I'd love to talk with you guys
some more and I'll see you as my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
