going to be a moving blog but I wanted
to a little intro to this talking about
where I'm moving what my plans are for
next year I go to the Kings College in
New York City and I have lived on campus
for about two years now I've lived in
this building and a studio apartment for
two years and while studio apartment is
really nice and I like it I'm so ready
to move on to kind of like a real
apartment that's off campus I have loved
living here and it has made me love this
neighborhood and so I'm gonna be staying
in the same neighborhood that I live in
right now in Brooklyn it's the most
beautiful neighborhood in New York City
and I'm obsessed with it I think that is
such a great place and I love it and I
feel so at home here and so I want to
stay in this neighborhood but I want to
have an actual one-bedroom apartment so
I am moving out of this apartment I'm
moving out for good I'm gonna be a
senior next year I'm like ready to start
paying for my own right cultivating good
habits before being completely on my own
and so I'm so ready to have my own
apartment this is gonna be my moving
blog so I'm gonna show you guys all the
moving process what it's like coming out
of here and just moving out I'll be
moving in in August so I'm going back
home over the summer to work on YouTube
and grab my youtube channel and work on
this kind of stuff at work and playing
with my nieces and nephews and have a
really good summer so I'm doing that I'm
gonna be coming back August 1st I'm
gonna be finding apartment SuperDuper
quickly I'm literally just gonna come up
and hope I find something and so that is
what I'm doing if you're wondering who
I'm living with I'm gonna stay with my
roommate that I have right now not just
really love living with her and we've
had a good experience and so next year
we're gonna be living together again I'm
gonna be doing so many apartment videos
and moving videos and all that kind of
stuff once the time comes because it's
so exciting moving into your own
apartment it's really scary but I just
feel like it's a point your life before
you coming your own person I'm gonna
start packing so I'm like sweaty I'm
really gross it's 90 degrees in New York
City so I'm very overwhelmed I finished
my last two finals today I'm officially
a senior which is exciting so yeah a lot
of you guys were also confused
I talked about being a senior and I just
wanted to say that I actually had a ton
of AP credits from high school that
transferred over so I got out of a year
of school which was super duper
fortunate my parents were super thankful
I was super thankful well it's scary
being 20 in graduating I am like ready
for it and I think I'm ready to actually
start living my own life and growing up
and I love college but I definitely
think I'm ready for my senior year if
you want me to do a full video I'm
graduating early how to work hard in
high school to do that you should
definitely let me know down below also
planning on staying in New York City
that summer after this summer so next
year I will officially be like
completely living there full-time and so
I'm a little bit scared for that I'm
really excited to have my last summer
home as you know college kid yeah make
sure you follow my book channel for the
summer vlogs I will be posting most of
them over on there and let me know what
you'd like to see on this channel over
the summer as well so excited to be done
with school I'm so excited to be back
home and I'm so excited to start my life
in New York City next year in August in
my own place that's it let's go ahead
and start packing up my studio apartment
so today's Thursday and I have to move
out by Saturday at 6 a.m. because that's
what my storage is being picked up and
so I have such a tight frame to get all
this stuff together but we can do it
guys so with my finals so I have like
full days to do it all I'm still really
nervous I want to show you guys where
I'm moving out of I've lived in this
building for about two years now
I've lived in different apartments but
I've lived in the building for two years
so I want to show you guys a view I
didn't sleep last night so I'm like kind
of crazy right now and jittery and kind
of sleep-deprived but it's ok so this
place is a disaster because as you can
see I've started packing but this is the
overview this is the studio apartment
where I've lived I have like a tour of
this place if you want to see it but
this is kind of like the general
overview it looks bigger on camera but
y'all this is a tiny little apartment so
this is it I'm so ready to have like a
full kitchen our desks are right here
I'm so ready to not have to live within
like a foot of the kitchen and then our
bathroom is right here so the bathroom
is also extremely messy as far as
packing goes
this isn't sponsored I wish it was
sponsored I love this company but I'm
using red bin basically they give you
these bends you put your stuff in it and
they pick it up and I hold it and it's
not that expensive so if you live in New
York City check out red bin but have
about 12 inch right here so I have lots
of bins to store my stuff I'm gonna
start with clothes right here because I
think that's where I have the most stuff
and then I'm gonna do like bedding and
kitchen and bathroom stuff so let's go I
am also gonna watch Gilmore Girls while
I do it watch Gilmore Girls forever ago
but I've recently gotten back into it
and guys Gilmore Girls is such a good
show just today is day two and we are
just packing up today my roommate Naja
is actually done with like class and
stuff now so she's actually going to be
moving out as well my bins they're all
pretty much full really don't have that
much stuff and I'm really thankful like
protip don't bring a ton of stuff to
college cuz it's so much easier to move
out other G's are also really bad so not
feeling that great but this is my purge
pile these are all things this backpack
I'm not throwing away it just broke like
the handle is completely broken right
here so that's why that's in the trash
those are things I'm giving away to my
roommate Naja keeping these are things
I'm taking home kitchen we haven't even
really started so betting I'm just gonna
do tomorrow so I've gotten quite a bit
done
I am officially completely packed my red
boxes are all stored see you guys
tomorrow for day three of my moving
block which I was freaking out hi I'm
Nadia threw me you don't have a shirt on
it's about time it was apparently
freaking out cuz I wake up at 6:00 oh I
overslept at 7:50 nightgown if he still
looks like if you know Michelle you know
she's very productive and she never
heard she sticks to the schedule
