actual human beings I've always wanted
to get married younger the fact that she
could have been taken away from me let's
say and wasn't is something that I just
have to thank Jesus for hi I'm so
excited for today's video because it is
going to be a more personal Q&amp;amp;A video
because about I have a vlog channel
called the shell out of her shell and I
actually asked for more like personal
questions that you guys may have on one
of my videos over there so if you want
to check it out this Michelle Michelle
you guys asked really good questions
just about like relationships and faith
a lot of other stuff and so I kind of
just wanted to combine all of my
favorites into one video that is more
personal recently I've gotten a lot of
new subscribers from a video that I put
out and so I feel like a lot of you guys
probably don't know that much about me
so I wanted to do this video just like
answering more personal things I feel
like aren't necessarily talked about as
much on YouTube if you just stumbled
across this video my name is Michelle
Reed I am 19 years old I'm super Taylor
said that I'm a Feeny fashion lifestyle
video sous-chef they subscribe and let's
go ahead and get right into the video
don't ask about my advice on catcalling
and how to deal with it you guys don't
know I actually live in New York City
for college and I definitely feel like
catcalling and kind of like harassment
towards like women definitely happens
more in urban areas whenever I come home
to Texas and like a more suburban area
it only really happens whenever it's
like 13 year old guys like trying to be
funny and I don't really that they give
it you old in New York I've definitely
had encounters that were also like kind
of scary
I think it's tip would be to just never
respond to them and it never actually
like make eye contact with them I don't
love you guys they disagree with this
but just personally from my own
experience whatever I don't give people
the time of day they'll kind of leave me
alone there's one encounter where I
actually had someone like follow me for
a little bit when I was getting out of
the subway and I was want to say really
scary and I just walked really really
quickly have my eyes forward and looks
very firm and I was left alone and I was
completely fine so if someone does cat
call you don't like look at them and
snark at them and make a comment because
I could just make it a whole lot worse
at the same time don't look really
scared it's so sad that what you
actually have to learn these things and
like know how to act
I wish then just treated women like
actual human beings and all animals
sometimes always look like you're
confident in yourself and that
not afraid of that you are strong
obviously things get scary or just out
of hand always tell someone for me I
usually have these encounters in the
subway or like walking out of the subway
I always tell someone and walk towards
something and something is scaring you
when do you see yourself settling down
and actually having kids
now I'm 19 so I don't really know
exactly like what I'm going to settle
down and have kids I don't see myself
having kids till like at least like 10
years probably maybe a little bit less
than that feel like a lot of people
different meanings for settling down for
me I've always wanted to get married
younger honestly like when people ask me
what my goal in life is it is honestly
to have a family be really content with
that I find that I'm the happiest
whenever I'm surrounded by my family in
the fact that I could build that
foundation for like my kids someday is
such a beautiful thing I don't ever
think that it should be proud upon or
discourage or seen as like less of a
goal in life the idea of being married
and having kids and living like a quiet
life and investing in my kids and
investing in my family I think that's a
really beautiful thing and it's like
it's really frowned upon now for like
women mostly to say that that is their
goal I was watching Tori Stirling vlog I
remember in one particular one she just
said that she wanted to like get married
have kids would be like a good
instructor I thought that was so cool
that something so simple could be your
addition in life but that's totally ok
that's like what it is for you which is
just want to be content with my life
wherever I'm at I do want to work I love
working for myself through YouTube
that's something that I hope I can
always do to some extent why did you
choose to be a vegetarian I honestly
just tried it out for a New Year's
resolution for a month to see like how I
feel see if it would be easy just kind
of as like something for fun and I
honestly found that I felt a lot better
I found that I wasn't craving me and I
kind of just stopped eating it I really
find that I felt better when I'm
very--it it and I also just felt kind of
like okay without it so just stopped
eating it and I'll spend like almost two
years feel great I feel fine I feel like
I have a lot more energy to split so I
honestly just did it for that reason I
did it for health reasons for me I don't
like dealing with raw meat I find not
having a cooked meat in college is
really easy and really nice and I
like vegetarian meals or lunching
through whenever I go well for me I just
don't like handling Rami and I feel like
if you don't like handling your food
that's kind of a sign that you shouldn't
be eating it which I know like handling
raw meat doesn't bother some people and
they eat it and they're fine
totally okay like I'm not saying that
that's like wrong to be that way I
honestly just do this for me
I don't like push this on people all
that exactly is your religion so how do
you actually what religion I am I am a
non-denominational Christian I believe
in Jesus Christ I believe in the Trinity
the Father Son and Holy Spirit I believe
that for God so loved the world that He
gave His one and only Son and that
whoever shall believe in Him shall not
perish but have everlasting life you and
your boyfriend everFi and if so how do
you handle disagreement I want to answer
this question because I feel like on
YouTube you guys see a lot of couples
that look really really happy they look
really content and nice they never argue
ever and I mean even say that they never
argue and I feel like for 95% of couples
it's probably not the case answer your
question I do argue with my boyfriend I
don't like to call it fighting because I
feel like whenever you fight with
someone you're at odds against each
other and you're on different size we're
at the clinic in a relationship you
don't fight you're on the same team you
just have disagreement we do disagree
about things we're humans and I feel
like before you marry someone you should
have disagreements because eventually
they're going to come and you should
know how to like handle those before you
actually get married so if you argue
with your significant other and you
watch youtube videos maybe like oh my
gosh like my relationship is not this
perfect just know people disagree you're
not abnormal your relationship is not
abnormal how do we fix them I think the
most important thing to first understand
is that you're on the same team you're
on the same playing field it's like a
lot of times when you argue with someone
it's easy to feel like you're against
each other and like you're out to get
the other person and that you're either
the victim or he's use a victim or she's
either either movie film and so I think
from the start you have to know that
you're on the same team and that you're
on the same playing field and that if
you really love this person you want to
see them succeed and that means that you
are not outs against each other I think
once you establish that the next thing
that's really important is to see things
from the other person's perspective this
is something that I'm not that great at
hi a lot of times make myself a victim
and
don't like that I do this at all it's
something I'm not proud of not saying
it's a good thing and also whenever I
fight with someone or disagree with
someone I have a tendency to want to run
off and go I run away from my problems
which is another thing that I don't like
that I sing instead of talking through
things like don't like confrontation I
avoid confrontation like the plague
so I think you have to be able to talk
through things and that means talking
about things that may be a little bit
more uncomfortable asked to talk about
everything before you even get an
argument even if you think something's
not a big deal make sure you're telling
them everything small things big things
talking a lot is really really good it's
whatever you don't talk and keep secrets
but things are going to come up and the
disagreements are going to happen any
other day know that you're still gonna
be dating this person and if you really
really love that you shouldn't want to
fight with them all the time you
shouldn't once argue with them all the
time and so you should want to hear
their point of view so things can be
solved easier which is a lot easier said
than done I'm not sitting here saying a
perfect justice because I am NOT you can
ask my boyfriend he's a lot better at
this than I am I think knowing how to
solve this agreement it's really really
good and it's healthy I've heard some
people say not to date as a freshman in
college how do you know if you should I
definitely heard this a lot like don't
date freshman year of college have fun
use it as you and be selfish
and do things for you I just want to
note that I'm not a believer in being
selfish and like doing things just for
you I think I'm a perspective of being
someone who is a Christian and someone
who likes to contribute to society I
don't want to be selfish I don't want to
just do things for me to feel good my
ambition in life is not just to be happy
that's not to help people to show other
people the light of the world to
contribute to society by having a job
and working hard to help people I think
that's beautiful
I think that's so much more beautiful
than like working on yourself and being
selfish and doing things just for you I
know that's like completely different
than this question but what's that being
said I just kind of went into college
with the mindset of like whatever
happens happens
I met my boyfriend and I really liked
him we hung out a long time before we
started dating like for real took things
really really slow everything is really
good to do freshman year of college and
not just like start relationship off of
that also grab another perspective I
think if you really like someone you
shouldn't just not date them because
you've been
not to freshman year of college I don't
need to be in a healthy relationship and
still meet other people and enjoy your
freshman year of college and have a lot
a lot of fun like a heck of a lot of fun
I would just say know yourself if you
don't want to be in relationship back to
eating people is a really beautiful
thing in dating someone who you really
truly love and that you respect as a
person and you're like happy to say that
you're dating them because the beautiful
thing as well last question I'm going to
answer is how did you and your family
deal with your mom's accident if you
guys don't know this is something I have
never really talked about in the video I
don't think or I have briefly and I
could draw my life video I'm all
searching it by a car while she was
running when I was in eighth grade I was
going into ninth grade she was drawing
really early in the morning and
functioning across the road didn't
actually have enough time it's really
dark and so someone actually sent her in
a car which is definitely the hardest
thing that I think has ever happened to
me there really 15 minutes or I just
didn't even know if I mom was alive I
woke up and told it like my mom was hit
by a car running we'll talk about this a
lot with people I think the thing that
got me through the most was Jesus in
short praying and knowing that someone
was there and having a really strong
family foundation which is another
reason why I love family so much I think
my family through that was like one of
the most important things ever
I'm also the youngest so I have all
older siblings which is another thing
that was just beautiful it's like seeing
all these people who were so much
mentally stronger than I was at the time
I love my mom so much and the fact that
she could have been taken away from me
that day and wasn't is something that I
just have to thank Jesus for it was
literally a miracle not very many people
survive those kind of things but my mom
did and I think that was a work of Jesus
and old God and I'm just so unbelievably
thankful that she's still here so that
is the end of my personal qat I'm
definitely bilious video got a little
bit more emotional so let me know if you
like to this if you like learning more
about my life maybe things that you
didn't necessarily know I mean know down
below if you enjoyed it also go watch my
last video I love you guys and I'll see
you guys and a little bit my friend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
