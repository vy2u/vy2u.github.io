anything different about this video but
I actually got a new camera that I'm
super excited about I have the camera
that I got / the lens that I put on it
down below if you want to check it out
me I'm so excited the quality's so much
more clear and it honestly just makes me
happy like watching these videos
today's video is going to be a lazy
summer kind of routine getting ready
with me wake up with me kind of videos
so it's like the morning routine but a
little west in depth not like the
business everything I do every single
day in the morning but more like these
are some things that I like to do when
I'm feeling lazy I'm officially on
summer break so give this a like if you
are ready for summer like I am because
summer is muggy I'm let me tell you guys
I believe that's all I have to say for
this intro so let's just go ahead and
get into the video so the first step of
my day is always to stretch and honestly
guys is probably the favorite part on my
day because I absolutely love stretching
I typically wake up around 9 or 10 and
then I will read I've been reading the
shopaholic series lately and it is such
a fun read in such a relatable read so I
definitely recommend it as a fun summer
book and then I head off and I will
light a candle lately I've been using
this tranquil beach one it smells great
for some athon then I head off into the
bathroom and I will put my hair up and
I'll just rinse off my face and brush my
teeth do all those morning bathroom
shenanigans
now for the makeup I start off with my
Smashbox primer water this keeps in my
makeup all day during the summer then I
use the covergirl Ready Set gorgeous
foundation which is a great glowy
natural looking foundation and for my
under eyes I use my instant age rewind
brightener concealer this is great and
it really rinds up my eyes like it says
it will and then I just set everything
with my Revlon Colorstay powder so it
doesn't melt off and for blush I'm using
this Physicians Formula blush called
happy and it's a very glowy nice
shimmery blush then I'm using this sunny
bronzer from Rimmel to give my skin a
little bit of bronze for eyes I'm using
this Clinique chubby stick in Bountiful
beige as a nice shimmery base and I'm
only using one eyeshadow color it's nude
from lorac pro just to give my eyes a
little bit of shimmer and for eyeliner
I'm going away from harsh and I'm going
with this olive eyeliner which is very
natural and something different and I've
been liking it lately and then we're
just finishing off with some of this
lights camera flashes mascara from Tarte
and somehow I forgot to do my brows so
I'm just filling them in with my
Anastasia brow Wiz in soft brown and
lastly I'm just finishing off with some
aqua for cos let me tell you my lips get
very dry in the summer and that is it
for a makeup look
so for my hair I'm just doing a
hairstyle by Aspen Tovar showed in one
of her recent videos it's just a
fishtail half-up half-down do so I'm
just brushing out my hair and then
putting my hair up into a half up half
down style but making it very loose so
I'm pulling out some pieces and
tightening it so it's not super
structured and then you just take the
little tail section and fresh braid it
for spread it this write it down so you
pull one piece over to the other side
and just keep doing that till about
halfway and honestly guys this really
hurts my arms so this is my I'm in pain
because I'm braiding face and then you
just secure the braid and that's it I've
been doing this hairstyle pretty much
every day and I loved it ever since
Aspen showed it in a video
so I'm usually too lazy to make
breakfast so I will go hit up some
Starbucks and get some coffee and some
treats with Gunnar and yeah I love
Starbucks and I'm not afraid to admit it
guys we actually went to an outdoor
flower shop that has the prettiest
flowers ever just to look around so for
my outfit I'm wearing this top from H&amp;amp;M
which I love it's nice and flowy and
then my pants are actually from Target
and they're so comfy and so cute they
give me like a cool 70s vibe which I
love
and then my sunglasses are from choies
and I've been wearing these a lot lately
they're super retro and then my gold
sandals are from Target and again these
are so comfy and I love Target they have
the best stuff ever and that was it for
my outfit so like all my videos I really
hope you guys like this one it was a ton
of fun for me to film and I really liked
how it turned out make sure to let me
know what you thought about this video
on Twitter and Instagram and go check
out my last one it was actually a kind
of pool party DIY and it was super fun
to film and I got to film it with my
friends so you should definitely check
that one out and yeah I guess I'll see
you guys in my next video which will be
Sunday videos I love you guys so so so
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
