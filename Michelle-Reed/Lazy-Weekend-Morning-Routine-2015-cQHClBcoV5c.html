today I'm going to be doing kind of a
weekend lazy day morning routine so what
I do whenever I don't really have a lot
of plans and I get to kind of do
whatever it was actually such a
beautiful day when I filmed this so I
also kind of logged stuff that I did
near at the end so it's kind of just a
mash up of my day in one video I guess
make sure to follow me on Twitter and
Instagram I love to chat with you guys
and you guys tell me that you're
watching this video because I think it's
a great way to connect with you guys so
I think that's everything that I have to
say so we're just gonna go ahead and get
into the video so at about 9 o'clock I
wake up and I've been watching Along
Came Polly on Netflix and so I like to
watch something in the morning on my
lazy days and then I try to get up and
ignore the fact that I didn't make my
bed but I'm always compelled to make it
because it's something that I have to do
even on a lazy day
then I usually like to light a candle in
the morning so I recently been burning
this Copacabana one from Bath and Body
Works and it smells amazing my mom
actually made this super delicious
breakfast this morning with these like
hearts egg in a whole things have you
seen those they're adorable and some
pancakes and fruit so I just ate this
with my family I really like to eat
breakfast with my family but I don't
always do it sometimes I eat alone it
just kind of depends at about 10:30 I
will go and do my hair and take a quick
shower
I actually didn't wash my hair this
morning but I kind of should have I did
this hairstyle
with this braid and I ended up taking it
out later because I really didn't like
it but you know sometimes I will put my
hair in a braid if I end up liking it
for my lazy day makeup I like to keep
things very simple so I just primed my
face with my Porefessional primer to
kind of get rid of any large pores on my
face and minimize them and then I just
used concealer instead of foundation
because I find that foundation can be a
little cakey and I've actually been
using this new powder it's the Revlon
Colorstay and surprisingly I really like
it then I added some blush just to give
my face a little bit of color and then I
lined my eyes with my they're real
eyeliner from Benefit and then I always
had to wear some mascara so I applied my
great lash mascara by Maybelline and
then finished off with a melon colored
lip balm
recently we got a new convertible so I
actually went out with my dad on it in
the highway and it was so much fun
my hair was crazy but it was a ton of
fun and I had such a good time and it
was actually beautiful outside so I
decided to go on a walk and I wore the
super comfy outfit my top is this grey
very loose shirt which I got at a thrift
store and that I was wearing these
pretty crazy pants I know they're not
everyone's cup of tea but they were so
comfy so I really didn't care and the
sunglasses that I decided to wear were
from Anthropologie and then I wore my
favorite target sandals so this is it
for my outfit I was so pretty outside
and today was honestly just a really
really good day and I had a great time I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
let me know if you did in the comments
and tell me what your favorite thing to
do on a lazy day is whether it's watch
Netflix make your favorite food etc I
would love to hear what you guys do
under Lazydays I guess I'll see you guys
in my next video
bye
on shore till the next one LP one heart
and every gamble</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
