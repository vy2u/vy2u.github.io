to be telling all out dating except
exist in college and as like a young
adult I have not sat down it just is
like a focus um a video and literally
such a long time I've been doing so many
like fashion videos in New York City
kind of videos I answer questions on my
Instagram which is Michelle Reed I have
been working on my Instagram guys and
actually making sure to post every day
you should definitely follow me on there
I put so many fun pictures here in New
York City and just like cool things that
I'm doing so you want to check it out
it's down below you should also
subscribe if you're new and leave me a
comment and let me know where you came
from go ahead and get right into the
questions question number one is how do
you feel confident when being single
first of all I think it is so easy to go
on Instagram or Twitter and see like
these relationship goals pictures and
things that looks like they're really
really healthy and you haven't figured
out there is no purpose relationship and
it weighs flies it absolutely sizing so
if you are single or my experience
whatever I have always been working hard
on something and really pursuing
something that isn't a boy that is when
a boy comes along if that makes sense
I've never been intentionally seeking
out some lending like hey I want to be
in a relationship it's always been like
I wear neon you do I'm working on my
sport and then that part of my life kind
of comes into play and I'm not saying
that you have to be in a relationship
but if you are single take that time to
know do what you want to do to pursue a
hobbies pursue a work or a job or
something that makes you happy and I
think everything else that comes from
that how do you know when a guy is worth
your time I could do the whole video on
this thing but let me just say something
straight up if you are thinking about
pursuing a guy I think that you should
definitely make sure that your
intentions and his intentions are
aligned and are watching a lot of videos
I'm completely about like relationships
and love and I feel like we have this
really really casual attitude towards
these things like we can just use them
like there's just extracurricular things
that we can use people I need to say
that is when things go crazy whenever
you start treating people as needs
instead of ends that some people's
feelings get hurt as the problems arise
that's what abuse comes in that is when
things go wrong I know I'm totally
taking all the tangent but I just wanted
to talk about this make sure you're
pursuing someone who actually loves you
for who you are who wants to be in a
relationship for a long term if you want
to be in a relation
long term someone who doesn't distract
you from you find that you are sucking
on your scores if you find that you're
not doing the things that you like your
hobbies your worth your job and that is
someone that I don't think you should be
dating I think meeting people is great
and to go on a few dates and realize
someone's not exactly for you that's
fine I think that's the beauty of dating
but you're supposed to do any edge
making sure that you're dating someone
who's going to make you a better person
and not someone who is going to
compromise your morals your values or
anything how do you deal with not losing
yourself whenever you are in a
relationship it's just such a good
question because I've used so many
people who have so many things that
they're passionate about so many things
that they're driven toward so many
things that like they're happy about and
again a relationship and everything just
kind of goes out the window
I think hey the first thing is not to
date someone please oh is going to do
that to you maybe you're dating someone
and you're thinking about being in an
actual relationship with them make sure
that they know that hey like this is
what I want to accomplish in life that's
- if you ever find yourself feeling like
you are using yourself cut ties I know
it may seem like you're hurting them but
it's so much better than hurting
yourself in the long run it and hurting
yourself in a way but you look back in a
year and you're like I don't even know
who I am this is not who I was before I
started dating this person so I asked if
I believe in saving myself for marriage
because of my faith and I'm not really
the kind of person at least ogron's kind
of self on the internet my life is
private but I have seen the overwhelming
amount of videos about sex on the
internet about things that are more
based on intimacy I just feel like it's
kind of a trend on YouTube to talk about
this and not really talk about it
without much care that way there was an
overwhelmingly minority group of people
who shared a different of any elements
and did lean on saving effects until
marriage and so I just felt compelled to
answer this question definitely I am a
Christian I believe in God I believe in
Jesus Christ I believe in Trinity and I
believe there are certain things in life
that God has commanded that I believe
that I should follow not because the
Bible is a rule book not because if you
do these things you're going to get into
heaven but because I feel like God knows
what makes us happy what's going to be
just happy in the long run or what's
going to allow us to flourish - one of
those things is stating ourselves until
marriage personally yes I'm not going to
have sex before marriage that's just
something that always
open within my relationships and I'm
always dating people who have been on
the same page with that belief I would
never date someone who didn't agree with
me on this from a Christian standpoint
yes but also from like a secular
standpoint one that doesn't have
anything to do religion I feel as if I
still would never want that back before
I'm married
I know the kind of person that likes to
casually think about stuff like that I
feel like I watched so many videos that
are like carrying virginity they're like
a sport or something that is just
something that you do it's not a big
deal and I just personally don't agree
with I feel like it's a big step it's
something that is more than just
something you do with your body and
that's how I think I know that's not how
everyone seems an experience of you know
my friends through life the people I've
talked about what people have started
getting into and a pattern of intimacy
in that way a lot of comments have come
out of that and right now along
jung-hwan 18 19 20 21 22 I want to spend
my time on meeting people having good
conversations with people Bonnie in a
way that doesn't require sex because I
think that that's so much more valuable
and I think I have all this time to meet
someone it's been time with them before
I'm married I'd rather spend that time
getting to know that in a way that
doesn't require you know my body that is
my outlook on this I know it's not
everyone's outlook I'm not saying it has
to be I just know the relationships that
I have been in they said been so much
more healthy because I have not given
into acting in a certain way that
compromises my world I feel like all the
internet that opinion just is not
credible at all I don't feel like anyone
has talked about this so I just want to
need to know if you are honest and
agency and you feel like no one agrees
with you if you feel like you're
watching these videos on Dania to say
you know sex isn't a big deal if you
think it is a big deal you're not alone
and you should not feel alone to you
everyone's happening about this you
always holler up because I am here I'm
totally with you and I don't think if
you have messed up in that aspect that
that makes you a bad person that makes
you not a Christian that makes you
someone who's looked down upon we are
all equal in it and we all sin how would
you describe the difference between lust
and love I really really like this
question because I think this is kind of
going off the last question that I
answered big loss is really tied with
treating people as they are commodities
and not actual people I feel like loss
is something that is very selfish it's
just
wanting to use people from certain means
and not actually carrying it on their
parts or so what their opinions are not
caring that they are people I think love
on the other hand is loving someone
despite any other flaws for loving them
for their ideas for who they are for
their beliefs and pursuing love in a way
that requires work and I'm just using
someone as a commodity but seeing them
as a beautiful soul as a beautiful
person letting is not always convenient
it takes a lot of hard work it takes
pursuing some of hearts how I would
compare this with an analogy I feel like
love is something that's kind of like
fast food in the moment it feels really
good then an hour later you bro credit
you do not like it as love it's like
eating a really really nutritious meal
to put in the work to cut the vegetables
to eat the salad to make it all work and
then the end you're so much more
satisfied because they're like look at
this relationship that I have created
with this person and it's so beautiful
it's helping both of you guys I'm sorry
there's a lot of food as hell what is
the key to a healthy relationship this
is something that I think a lot of
people ask I definitely get varies from
person to person different people have
different things as they leave one with
a vulnerability and two would be worth
actually reading a book right now by
brené Brown which is called daring
great lead all about vulnerability being
open with yourself you want to check out
that book definitely recommend it it's
so good but you can't be open with
yourself if you can't pour out your
heart to someone if you can't tell
someone what you're struggling with just
enter most things that you deal with
I feel like relationships are really
really hard to come by when you have
communication problems unless you're at
the point where you feel comfortable
enough with someone to share your life
to share your worries and your struggles
how they get ready for a relationship I
think that's the first thing a second
would be work
we live in a culture where everything
just has to be easy we like instant
gratification you like things to be
quick and simple especially with like
technology and everything and I just
think we apply that with our
relationship on is knowing that
someone's upset and you're really really
tired and you just want to go to bed but
you know something is on their mind and
so you pour into that and you try to
listen to what that is
love is serving someone with acts and
being there for them whenever they
actually need it and pouring out your
heart and lugging them as if you like
love your friend and our generation
everything supposed to be easy and I
don't think love is easy so the minute
when something hard realized this is
I'm going to flee I'm going to go by
myself I'm going to work on myself and
be single until someone else comes by
and makes things easier so those are all
the questions I'm going to answer in
this video if you have any thoughts on
anything I've said in this video leave
them down below I'd love to hear them I
think that the comment section should
just be a place where you can discuss
things if you see someone struggling in
the comments go get them and hey what's
up and help them out if you enjoy this
video make sure to subscribe and watch
my last video and be linked right here
along with all my other social medias I
love you guys so much bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
