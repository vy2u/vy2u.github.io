do a Q&amp;amp;A video for you guys
currently my grandparents are in town at
Jamie and Jenna both graduated and I
have finals all this week so this is
really all I could think to film this
week but I will be out of school soon I
will be making so many good videos for
you guys so just let this week kind of
pass and get ready for the videos to
come because I know what video I'm
uploading Sunday and I'm super excited
cuz it's gonna be super cute so you
should definitely subscribe so you will
be ready to see that video ask for
questions on my Instagram like always so
if you want to be a part of these q and
A's you can follow me on there because I
do mention usernames in this video and
with all that being said we're gonna go
ahead and get into the questions I'm 15
and I've never had my first kiss is this
bad no it is not bad at all enough it's
perfectly okay I don't get the whole
like you must have your first kiss by
this age because it's so not true it's
complete baloney and it is not a thing
don't worry about having your first kiss
it will happen when it happens and I
promise it will be great what do you
like to do as a hobby besides to YouTube
so outside of YouTube I actually am a
dancer I dance all my high school dance
team or drill team that's what it's
called here in the South I mainly
YouTube is what I do and I love it it's
my favorite hobby and I wouldn't give it
up for anything opinions on
long-distance relationships I think if
you've been with someone for a long time
and you know that your relationship is
gonna be taken to the next level
long-distance relationships are fine and
they're okay and I support them I just
think it's up to the person will you and
Gunnar a dog to me I would definitely
call him and ask if we will talk to you
I'm filming a video and someone asks if
you adopt them and I wanted to hear your
response so that no just those reasons
oh right otherwise definitely yes if you
can change one thing about the world
what would it be and why I feel like
nowadays the world is kind of obsessed
with technology you can't go anywhere
without seeing ten people just on their
phones not even talking so honestly I
wish people would just talk more in
public I know this is something that I
struggle with I'm not just pointing out
everyone else because I know I deal with
it personally but it's kind of sad when
you think about it like no one really
talks anymore if you could change one
thing about yourself what would be and
why
now this is kind of contradictory to the
last question but I'm a pretty quiet
person so I wish I was more outgoing and
friendly because I'm just honestly not
the most talkative person like I love
meeting people but it's not something
that really comes naturally first would
you rather know how you died or when she
died definitely how I died because when
I die that would be so freaky and I just
never really want to know them do you
have more Holy Grail or wholly failed
DIY projects definitely holy fail guys I
am absolutely terrible IDI why things
and I hate that there's like this DIY
trend going on right now on YouTube
because I'm terrible at them like I am
the least crafty person you will ever
find and I definitely just rather buy
something that's been $50 trying to make
it when it looks super preppy and not
even good if you had to choose between
not being able to have Starbucks ever
again or having hoops smacked into your
hair what would you choose this is
honestly the weirdest question I have
ever received and I'm slightly disturbed
but definitely the poop what three
emojis describe you do you ever feel
like giving up with school I'm assuming
this question means going from public
school online school I could be wrong
though but online schooling just really
isn't for me I know friends who've done
it and just not really enjoyed it and
for me I need to be
people to be social like I won't really
do it if I'm in my room all day doing
homework so I don't know it's not really
for me but I know it is for other people
any weird secret talents now this might
be really gross
and I know other people can do this but
I can actually pop my shoulder out of
place like this but I heard like you can
get stuff like that so I try not to do
it as much as possible
do you like what a burger if you're not
from Texas or I don't know if there are
other places in the south we have a
place called Whataburger which is
basically like a burger fry pan place
it's amazing and it's delicious and yes
I love it with all my heart so that is
the end of this Q&amp;amp;A video I hope I got
to answer your question and if not just
look out for the next Q&amp;amp;A and maybe
you'll be and I'll see you guys on
Sunday I guess I love you guys so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
