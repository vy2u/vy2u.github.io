this video I know I say that in every
video this video is also in cooperation
with Poshmark I haven't done like a
straight up classic outfits video in
such a long time that was largely
because I felt like you guys didn't
really like like fashion videos anymore
and I was like I feel like people are
only watching vlogs but lately on my
Instagram if you want to follow its
at-michelle read a lot of you guys have
been commenting like please do it
outfits video especially outfits and I
wear to class or that or more Catalan
sophisticated like my street style that
kind of thing so I thought that it would
be so fun just to put together a few of
my favorite outfits right now if you're
gonna get your panties in a wad because
this is sponsored you can go ahead and
click that X sorry it's just a cool app
everyone uses Poshmark I'm selling
clothes on Poshmark obviously I live in
New York City and I love changing my
fashion all the time but my apartment is
like yea big and so I can't fit a ton of
clothes which means I am constantly
getting rid of things if you don't know
what Poshmark is it's basically a
website where you could sell your own
clothes which is super cool and I always
didn't really like it because I was like
I don't want to have to pay to ship
these things out watch me actually pays
to ship then they send you like an
actual actual shipping label I have my
own closet if you want to check it out
it's Michelle Reid YT I'm gonna be
selling 10 items so if you want to
download the app for free make sure to
check out the link in the description
box it should be right at the top it's
super cool because you can use it just
on your phone they have an app that you
can use and so you can totally just
download it if you do end up making your
own closet make sure to include it in
the comments down below because I'm
gonna be looking at you almost closet
aash mark has a ton of different brands
but specifically they have like Nike
they of Louis Vuitton they have adidas
so these are big brands guys so for the
items that I'm selling just have this
body con skirt which I got from boohoo
but I just never really wore this old
Navy dress which I've worn a couple of
times but it kind of just takes up space
in my closet selling this top which I
just also never really where it's from
made while telling this romper which
I've worn a few times but it's just too
short on me now cuz I grew this dress I
literally wore once it's from me pink
it's so cute it has like cut out this
dress I just also never really wear you
it's like this really pretty pink kind
of flowy drew and then lastly I got
these baseball jeans but they are just
too big for me and are a size 27 I also
have these Sam Edelman shoes they're
these tie up ones super cute and I'm
also selling these little heels for each
of them let's just go ahead and get
right into the outfits so starting with
this first outfit I'm just wearing these
pants which are from Zara I love them
they're like this really pretty plaid
pattern and I like how they kind of like
go out at the ankles I just think
they're a lot more flattering and then I
just have on a plain black shirt which
is from Target and then this brandy
melville I love your jacket which I got
a while ago and for my statement shoes I
love these boots they're from public
desire and I think they really just kind
of make everything come together so this
outfit I really like I know this dress
kind of looks like an apron but I just
think it's so cute and like modest but
if you dress it up you can look
SuperDuper cute it's from ModCloth and
then I just have on a body suit
underneath which is from made well which
might still be on sale so I would
definitely go check that out and then I
just cut these socks to make them into
the high socks and I'm just wearing
these boots which are from Naturalizer
and then my go-to Madewell ring and some
hoop earrings and that is it for this
outfit this next outfit is definitely my
favorite I love this my jacket is
literally like a teddy bear I just think
it's so comfy and it's from boohoo
it was like super cheap so you should
have to check it out I got it off the
dope app if you want to follow me I'm
wearing that same bodysuit and then just
some thrifted high-waisted jeans and
these boots which I got from ModCloth as
well but unfortunately was a while ago
so I don't think they're still available
and then I just kept on the hoop
earrings and that was it for my third
outfit
this last one is definitely the most
casual but I'm just wearing this top
which I got from 2025 it's like an
oversized blouse and since it is winter
I just threw on a long-sleeve shirt
underneath to make it more wintry and
then I'm just wearing my made while
high-waisted jeans and then these boots
as you guys know I'm obsessed with
they're from Nine West and they're so
comfortable I love how they have like
the tie up they just really add a lot to
any outfit and of course I'm rocking the
all-black because this is New York and
it's like one of my go-to
so those are the outfits I hope you guys
like them let me know down below which
one was your favorite also make sure to
