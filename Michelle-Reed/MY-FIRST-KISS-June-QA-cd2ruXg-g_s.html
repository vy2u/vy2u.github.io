you know that kind of thing today I will
be doing a Q&amp;amp;A video because the last
time I did a Q&amp;amp;A was like a year ago or
something and so I decided that this
would probably be a really good video to
do because sometimes I feel like you
guys just don't really know me now
whenever I do these kind of videos I try
to ask questions on my Instagram which I
will have like here just because I have
the most followers on there rather than
Twitter's so definitely follow me on
Instagram and if you want to follow me
on Twitter too so I don't want to have
like a super duper long intro or
anything so we're just gonna go ahead
and get into this type of the first
question comes from Casey tell Sora
and it is what do you want to be when
you grow up so I'm not really sure at
the moment what I want to do I kinda
have no idea to be completely honest I
know that I want to do something with
maybe video and writing some thinking a
video journalism I'm not really sure
maybe something with fashion I honestly
have no idea
Sakshi Raj asks how many X's do I have
so currently I have zero X's because
gutter is my only boyfriend I've ever
had pretty nuts a Marikina I should say
would you rather have eyelashes on your
toes or toes on your eyelashes today I
would definitely rather have eyelashes
on my toes because just imagine having
toes on your eyelashes hailey Marie
wants to know if I ever get Boyd for
making videos I have never gotten
bullied for making videos I think for
the most part people think it's a pretty
cool thing I think the more that you get
the more people understand that it's
kind of an established hobby which is
kind of sad that you have to have quite
a few subscribers or people recognize
that it's a legitimate thing I'm
virtually giving you a hug right now if
with any Boyd for making video you said
it and she asked what did she ask Jesse
to describe my first kiss with Gunnar so
my first kiss with him um well it was
our second date we went to the movies
and then he was taking me home and he
went inside and met my parents and then
we were on our porch and we hugged and
the rest was history
Elena Simmons asked what my most awkward
moment was so I think my most awkward
moment ever was probably when I sat on
gum in seventh grade I said all gum and
I had to like wrap my hoodie around my
waist and it was really really
embarrassing but all in all my life is
kind of an awkward moment
so Eddie Rose asked if I'm nervous to
get my license yes I am I am turning 16
on July 1st and so I will be getting my
license I don't think I'm gonna get it
on my birthday because I'm so scared of
failing I haven't practiced parallel
parking yet so I don't think I'm gonna
get it on my birthday but I am quite
nervous and I will probably keep my
pants while I'm driving wait I did not
just say Sophie Zell wants to know what
classes I am taking next year so next
year I am doing pre-ap precalculus AP
English 3 AP US history and the regular
physics because science is just not my
thing and then I'm also doing fashion
design which I'm really excited about
because I don't know how to sew and I've
always wanted to learn how to and I'm
also doing the cooking class which is
like the culinary arts of the Caleb
Rousey asked if I could hang out with
any youtuber for a day who would eat and
why so I would probably hang out with
Danis not on fire because he's probably
the funniest person ever and I love his
support her videos they are my life and
I feel like he would be so fun just to
hang out with and have as a best friend
sherburn's asked what is the cutest
thing my boyfriend has ever done
probably my favorite is one night I was
really really stressed out with school
because I get stressed out really easily
with school he just left a bouquet of
flowers and sour patch kids at my door
and told me to stop freaking out and it
was like the sweetest thing ever
I cried inside I think no I actually
cried Kat the great asks where do you
see yourself in ten years in ten years I
will be 26 so hopefully I will be living
in your
city god-willing with a husband baby
because like i don't want to get married
younger not crazy young but just like
right out of college maybe having some
kind of job hopefully or stay at home
and if my husband can afford that i
don't really care i could do anything to
be completely honest hard batani
I'm sorry if I'm saying that wrong wants
to know what my height is and what I
wish I could change it to so I'm five
six or like five six and a half and I
like my height I think it's not too tall
but not too small so I really don't want
to change it I'm perfectly happy with my
height and that's uh that's the end of
this Q&amp;amp;A video and like always I hope
you enjoyed I think that I want to do
more of these because I love the
answering you guys's questions and I
want you guys to get to know me more so

summer or if you're even off for summer
break and I know some people are still
in school I'm praying for you yeah enjoy
your day I'm so stupid oh my gosh we now
