hi guys I'm so excited for this video
I'm going to be doing my March favorites
video to my be like my first official
favorites video round of applause March
has been an awesome month yay to march
go ahead and get started the first thing
we'll be talking about it's a pair of
glasses company called for me as if I
wanted to review a pair of their glasses
and I just decided you know sure I'm not
being paid or anything that's not any
cool cuz I've always wanted a pair of
like glasses to wearing like my advice
videos or something they come in like a
hard shell like this they also come with
like a soft case so I was really happy
you get like both cases the inside like
a pale pink color then when you actually
like see the glasses I got these zones
they look like this they're like the
total nerd glasses you guys are gonna
make fun of me so much because these
aren't even real glasses i'm thinking
like fake glasses but they look like
this on and you guys are totally gonna
like hate on me but i love them makes me
feel so smart when i wear these like
hello my name is Michelle I'm not sure
the exact like number on these I'll put
it right here cuz I don't really in
order to find that to tell you guys the
truth you were only I think like $25 I
think even if you need like prescription
glasses they also you can put in like
your information for your lenses and
they can make the prescription lenses
for you you know if you just want to
rock some fake glasses like me you can
totally do that so for MU actually has a
thing where you get your first pair of
glasses free all you have to do is pay
for shipping which I think there's only
seven dollars and i want to say the
shipping is really fast it literally
came in within like three days i just
got like the cheapest shipping there is
definitely recommend these glasses if
you are in need of some glasses and yeah
now on to beauty favorites um I guess
I'll just go ahead and get started first
thing is a lip product and you guys know
I'm obsessed with this i'm wearing is a
right now it is my Revlon lip butter and
raspberry pi freaking adore this so much
it's a perfect just kind of like
raspberry pink and honestly like
straight-up pink lip six just don't look
good on me and this is just a really
pretty color just a really nice springy
color and I would definitely recommend
it if you need something that's kind of
like a raspberry color i also have a
mascara this is the Maybelline the
rocket volume Express a little bit late
on this but this is definitely more like
a volume mascara I would say so I really
really like this or eyeshadow i have two
different eye shadow kind of products on
the
one is my naked urban decay basics I've
actually love this since like December
when I got it this is legit all I born
I've never worn another eyeshadow since
this but five matte shades and then one
shimmery one and they're all basic
neutral colors I really like naked too
and faint and then I really like these
two kind of all over the lid colors so
yeah I would definitely recommend this
if you're looking for some nice basic
neutrals abling color tattoo and the
shade barely branded this is such a
pretty color it's just like a shimmery
champagne color I love to just wear this
all over my lid just a nice like I said
shimmery color and it's perfect just for
everyday use so I have one blush and
this is my clinic blush and iced Lotus
it's a super pretty just purpley pink
kind of frosty blush which is really
gorgeous for spring I feel like or this
every day I'm wearing it right now but
you can't see you cuz the lighting is
super bright so you can kind of see
right so I have to nail polishes I
actually haven't been painting my nails
that much because I've been in
competition season and I basically can
like never wear nail polish so the first
one is sec n Tropez it's a gorgeous
neutral color I'm it's more like a cool
tone row which is more of like my kind
of taste I also love lapis of luxury and
I looks like bikini so teeny without
like the sparkles in it but it's super
pretty and gorgeous and I like to wear
this on my toes so then I have a candle
this is actually my sister Jamie's
candle so we're to keep this one on the
down low but it's called poolside and if
you know anything about me I love the
scent of beaches I love like sand and
like salt water all that asha smells so
good this is described as lemon orange
and tropical blossoms get a splash of
coconut in a fragrance that rebels in
the cool side being poolside gosh this
is legit some are any candle like this
place he wanted to be summer so bad for
fashion I have been obsessed with shorts
just shorts in general I have four pairs
to show you guys I want some of these in
my outfits of the week video so for
pattern shorts I adore these ones they
have Birds on it and they're from
forever 21 they're so cute I think
they're like twenty dollars and I love
these I also have this pair of polka dot
ones which i think i showed in a haul
video but these are also from forever 21
and i have two pairs from j.crew the
first one is just these kind of like pin
stripe blue and white nautical ones and
then i have the classic mink
in chino shorts from j crew as well an
obsessive shorts cuz it's been really
warm where I live so yeah my favorite
places to buy shorts are j.crew and
forever 21 they have the best you got
these on sale for forty percent off my
last favorites of this whole video is
coke I know a lot of beauty gurus are
like can't drink sugary carbonated
drinks I have to have my organic juice
no I love coke I'm obsessed with every
so died there's not really a soda that I
don't like besides sprites it's not
really soda and literally like every day
when I come home from school I just
drink coke it's like my few oso any
other soda lovers Cheers so the end of
this video sorry fellas come hyper crazy
