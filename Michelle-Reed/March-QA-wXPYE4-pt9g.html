Q&amp;amp;A video which I've never really done
one of these were just straight up asked
questions on my Instagram or Twitter and
films and so I decided to today also
it's really pretty outside and so I
tried to fill on the outside but I
totally failed dogs started barking the
wind was really crazy um some lady came
outside and was like yelling to her dog
so there's awkwardly sitting there and
as a fails i moved inside so i hope you
guys are ok with that if you want to be
featured in one of these videos make
sure to follow my instagram and twitter
and yeah cuz that's where i asked
questions so I'm just gonna go in and
see what you guys asked megan curtis 101
asked when did you start getting
interested in making videos and i think
i mentioned this in a past video i'm not
really sure about when I was about nine
i made like american girl doll stop
motion videos just really goofy stupid
videos with my friends and um it was on
a channel called smiling Shelley I guess
over the course of Hell in my now six
years i guess the course over like five
to six years I just grew to love making
videos I've definitely been here on
youtube for a while Caitlin XO asked you
ever get annoyed with filming youtube
videos no I do not I love filming I love
making things I love editing the only
time I get annoyed is when my computer
like shuts down on me or like deletes
videos or I don't know actually not very
old it's just really ghetto it I don't
even know which is all messed up and I'm
saving up for anyone currently so love
hailey or smile buddy's ex Oh ass do you
love me and yes Haley I love you I love
your videos you're awesome shoutout
Maddie grace 27 after you ever get
annoyed with your voice I'm editing
youtube videos yes can't believe
somebody asked this what I'm editing my
videos I'm just like you or Sarah myself
cuz I don't know my voice I don't know I
just don't like it Miranda mindo
fake-ass how did you get your youtube
username it was so excited you ask this
because I've been wanting to tell you
guys forever okay I used to have an old
channel called smiling silly when I was
like eight or nine and like I said
embarrassing videos shout out if you
knew about that Gino before you watch
this one I was a total dork you got to
lead it for some reason for copyright or
something and so I wanted all of my 10
subscribers or however many i had to
know this channel was still smiling
shelley so I'm
this is styling Shelley but i forgot the
why so that is how this is smiling shell
came to be i really expected you know to
this channel to actually prosper and get
20,000 subscribers by the way thank you
very much what it did I really wish I
picked it different use your name but
you know something you can do it's kind
of embarrassing but whatever Kelly
Papa's ass at your school do you go on
the drill team if you don't make it as a
cheerleader no that's not how it works
cheerleading agile team work way
different things and they don't
correspond at all Morgan Walters asked
have you ever viewed anyone's Chino when
they asked you to in the comment and i'm
just getting straight up honest with you
guys no I don't believe in self
advertising comment when people message
me sometimes I will check out their
channel but like I just don't in the
comments and I don't know if that's rude
but I think you should develop your own
views and subscribers by making good
videos not commenting on somebody else's
for somebody to check out your channel I
just don't think that's right Cassie
olenski asked what time you go to bed at
night on school nights and on the
weekend so on school nights Oh try to go
to sleep by like 1030 but it usually
ends up being like 11 on the weekends if
I'm with my friends i'll stay up to like
two or three or whatever it is just like
me alone and just staying up usually
about 12-1230 usually when I go to sleep
on weekends training Tina 101 asked was
it scary trying out for your drill team
freshman year yes it was very scary and
I'm just gonna tell you guys this I
haven't really told you guys about this
but on the day of my tryouts my mom was
actually hit by a car it was like the
worst in my mom's fine but he was really
scary for me and I wasn't even gonna try
out but my mom actually told me to and
so that was definitely the scariest day
of my life and just with tryouts and
then that happening it was really bad i
don't really like to talk about it but
of course not all you guys are gonna be
in the same situation i was you want me
to do a whole video on drill team what
it is and tips and whatnot i can
definitely do that i just don't feel
like many people would be interested but
i mean if you would definitely comment
or thumbs up this video sienna new and
as i've always wanted to be a beauty
guru but i'm afraid that people on my
school to find out think it's weird how
do you handle that first off I want to
say if you do want to make videos you
cannot care about what people your
school are gonna
think well dunno about I channel like
pretty much everybody does who knows me
well we don't even know me you know
about my videos I just don't care I've
never really been made fun of it people
honestly thing at school don't really
think it's weird so what's really cool
as my yearbook is actually doing a page
on me now which I totally forgot about
that it's really cool definitely don't
keep it a secret something to be proud
i'm not ashamed that sounded like some
cheesy infomercial or something Maddie
at least 99 asked if you could only use
one make a product what would it be and
it would probably be mascara naciste X
asked if you could switch places with
anyone for a day who would it be gotta
think about this probably blake lively
cuz i love her Jessica can Meek s can
you describe your style in four words a
simple clean cut I guess is that the
counts as one salty words comfortable
and casual so yeah Kayla Harvey asked
who's your favorite singer songwriter
probably be foster the people that's a
band but i love them i looked on musical
says she also asked what do you do
people make fun of you for being a
Christian if you guys didn't know I am
Christian um I don't get made fun of it
though people try to tear you down for
that then that's them that's their
opinion but it just doesn't affect me I
guess marionville asked when are you
ever gonna do a room tour I need
literally like have a room tour at from
the summer in my room is exactly the
same so I don't feel it necessary to do
that but if you guys want me to do an
updated one only thing that's actually
changes my bulletin board but you know
you guys want new one I guess I'll do
what Beatrice Lopez asked what do you
want to be when you grow up I want to be
in film and editing making so something
in that cinematography I also live in
New York City I know it's a really big
dream I love it New York City's my
favorite place I know it's cliche but
yeah i was gonna answer a few more
lauren Darden asked have you ever done
any sports besides drill team i have
danced like done studio dance but
besides that i have not a lot of people
my family played like basketball and
stuff but I've always just been a dancer
and that's really the only thing I've
ever done so XO anna-lena asked you like
to travel and honestly I really don't
like to travel that much unless it's
like New York City or something really
don't mind not traveling and kind of
more of like a home body person so Nina
Caroline one asked what curling iron do
you use and I use a hot tools one inch
scrolling are and that's my favorite
growling art she also asked if I could
do in everyday like hair curling
tutorial honestly guys my everyday curls
are just the ones in my valentines day
makeup tutorial which are linked below
but if you guys want me to do another
one just specifically on my hair because
you get so many questions on how I curl
my hair I thinking about doing that just
because a lot of people ask me also I
just quickly want to say that stylehaul
