be my first advice video these are gonna
be called Michelle tells person who
suggested this was 13 and Couture so I
will leave her link and then down bar
yeah thank you so much for the creative
name I really liked it and that was
exactly what I was looking for first off
I just want to say to check out my
Twitter the down bar cuz i made a new
one just for you too because my other
one was getting personal and i know a
lot of people kind of were mad about
that I'm sorry but it's my personal
choice at the end so yeah having more
geared toward you guys anyway so yeah so
this episode is going to be all about
starting a YouTube channel and about how
to tell your parents about it how to
tell your friends how to become
successful just all that stuff that a
lot of people asked about so the first
thing I'm going to be talking about is
asking your parents about your YouTube
please don't start a YouTube channel not
tell your parents it's such a bad idea
in the end they're probably gonna find
out they're most likely going to be
really like stunned I guess and just I
don't know I don't think it's a good way
to go if you're scared about that don't
be honestly I think that you'll think
it's a lot worse than it actually is I
have really really easygoing parents
like my mom thinks YouTube is amazing
she watches on my videos and she like
reads the comments and stuff and my dad
is in the marketing so he thinks it's a
good way to like be your own little
business person so I mean in the end my
parents don't really care but I know
that there are some parents who aren't
okay with it cuz they don't believe it's
safe honestly if your parents tell you
know and you've argued to begin some and
come up with points I just think in the
end you should just go with their toys
and not make one because I don't think
that's a good idea but if you're trying
to convince your parents to let you
definitely just tell them that it's a
really good experience
telling your friends um I know a lot of
people are really embarrassed by their
videos I'm not at all actually like all
my friends know about my videos they
watch all my videos too so what's up
friends um I don't really think there's
a way you can go about it try to make it
easier I think it's just something you
really have to just come out and say
probably think it's gonna be a lot worse
if your friends are good friends they're
not gonna be like oh you're stupid and
you make videos they'll be accepting and
just tell them it's something you like
to do and I'm not very good at that kind
of advice just because I don't think
it's very embarrassing my last point is
gonna be all about how to get successful
because i know that's a really big
question that a lot of people have just
tips on starting out so first make a
username that you're not gonna regret
later i hate my username there's a long
story behind it it was actually just an
accident and definitely make it
something that people are gonna remember
like something that rhymes like
missglamorazzi is a really good example
instead of porky 658 I don't know after
the actual video part definitely make
videos I know a lot of people say like
popular videos I don't think so i think
you should do unique videos you can do
really unique stuff with lookbooks you
can also do unique self with not even
like beauty videos you can do other
stuff that's cool and just unique
instead of just the traditional stuff i
think i like watching unique videos
versus just boring tags and stuff um you
don't even have to have that good of
like equipment you have to have a good
camera or lighting I just use natural
lighting I think you should use like
lips but just set up your camera in
front of your window and film now for
advertising your channel definitely
don't be the person that just goes on
other peoples and comments check out my
channel that is so annoying and it's so
noxious that I just hate it I mean
message me and they like hey I like your
videos I tagged you in this and I want
to be you two friends check out my
channel that doesn't really bother me
because I mean that's just not as bad
but when you just go straight up on
somebody's channel and say check out my
channel that is so annoying you can ask
any guru if that annoys them and if they
say no then they are lying because that
is really annoying just enter people's
contest I think that's a big thing
you're gonna get a lot exposure from
that upload videos on a schedule you
don't have to have asked
Jill necessarily but just make sure
you're fluent with them don't make it
one video a month or something you're
not going to get very far with that
interact with your viewers to reply to
the comments reply doing messages um you
can get a twitter and instagram if one a
twitter or instagram for youtube you
should do that too so that is honestly
all the advice i really have for this if
you have any specific questions feel
free to comment or message me and i
replied to the majority of my comments
and all my messages so again if you have
any other suggestions for the series
definitely comment them down below I got
a lot of feedback on my last video so
thank you guys so much I think I'm gonna
do the high school one next I hope you
guys enjoy this and i'll see you guys my
next video ah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
