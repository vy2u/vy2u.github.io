Michelle tells if you don't know what
those are these are just my advice
videos I literally get dozens and dozens
of comments just like need help with
high school and you need help finding
friends I need help with this this is
all related to school and I decided to
finally just sit down I've honestly kind
of been procrastinating it because it's
such a big topic and I want to make sure
I include everything also I know a
little bit a complete mess I don't know
what's going on with this hair its face
and need to film this and I don't want
to do a beauty video so also I got my
good old friend of my bulletin board
right here I'm in the process of redoing
it and making it look all cute and stuff
as you can see I've been in a little
artsy mood I'm a freshman in high school
if you guys don't know I think I've have
enough advice as of right now to do this
video however scary you think high
school is gonna be tone that down about
five didn't make sense tone that down a
little bit it's really not scary at all
I mean I can see how they'd be scared
because I was scared I was like Oh high
school but you know I kind of got used
to it and the first topic I want to talk
about is just generally finding friends
because I feel like that's a big thing
you know I'm coming from a middle school
my middle school divided in half half of
us went to one school and half of us
went to the school I went to
there's also another middle school where
all of them went to my high school so
basically a lot of my friends went to
the high school that I didn't know there
was definitely a lot of different people
to meet I have like a few really close
friends I have like my five best friends
and my drill team
I can generally say that I really really
am blessed to have them I also have a
few other friends out of drill team I'm
actually gonna be doing a video with
them soon I think like Wednesday so I'm
really excited for that finding friends
honestly middle school I really didn't
have a ton of friends I'm just gonna be
totally honest with you guys I just I'm
more person who's kind of reserved I
don't go out there initiate
conversations kind of people if somebody
came up and talked to me I'd be like oh
hey what's up like I would totally be
okay with that but like I don't just
initiate conversations I mean I had a
few like really close friends that was
kind of it coming in high school I think
is a really good time to meet people I
know this is really cliche but joining
some kind of sport or something that
you're interested in really helps you if
I didn't join my drill team I literally
would have
five less really good friends and I have
more friends on their tooth but it's so
many people through that so many people
who share the same interests as me which
is really great because I feel like
whenever you share interests with people
it's a lot easier to make friends I
guess not saying that you can't have
friends that don't have the same
interests as you because I have a lot of
other friends who aren't the same as me
we need something is such a good way to
meet people whether that's like some
kind of language club a sport thrill
team like me I know some people did
Quidditch I would definitely recommend
it to make friends I don't know how to
say this but um if you're out there just
like I really need to make friends I'm
gonna try to make friends and you're
just really trying I would say kind of
hold back a little bit friends come
naturally I wouldn't say like I know it
sounds kind of bad don't try to make
friends it will come naturally we'll
just leave it up for fate I guess you
will eventually meet people and so you
know there's the whole thing of
seniority I know a lot people who
they're gonna get like bullied by
seniors and quotation marks that doesn't
really happen
um what he does I mean the senior do
think they're like the top dogs like
yeah let them have their year of time
and so the next topic that I want to
address is like grades and stuff and
staying organized that is such a big
thing going into high school it is so
much harder than middle school I learned
that I'm such like a type-a person I
like don't get a good grade on something
I kind of freak out and it kind of sucks
um I never really was used to getting
B's in old school
ever got like any beyond anything I'd be
like oh my gosh end of the world I would
say get used to that high school is a
lot harder especially if you're taking
honors or pre AP classes which is what
we call them a lot harder you have a lot
more tests you have to study more it's
definitely more intense or at least for
me I was shocked by how much harder it
was I keep a planner keep organized of
your stuff I might do a separate video
on keeping organized you know stay on
top of things don't forget stuff or the
years that are gonna help you get into
college so I just say focus pretty much
my grades I have like a B in some
classes occasionally what just sucks and
I there or don't like it it bothers me I
actually had all A's this semester which
I was really happy about
yeah grades aren't everything don't
freak out that much I know I'm such a
hypocrite saying next I freaked out
about everything take classes that
you're interested
that's another thing high school has a
lot more classes offered early early
spine does I want to talk about is just
like learning who you are I guess this
is so cheesy I just said that you know
find what you enjoy I would say find
what makes you happy I really love to
dance I really love drill team if you've
seen like my little pom competition
routine I'll link in the downbar I love
to dance but that is armas lima thing
that I love the most what I'm doing
right now is what I love the most I love
filming I love editing it's what I want
to do when I grow up I want to be some
kind of film person with like editing
and stuff because I really enjoy it and
I'm lucky to find what I love and what I
gifted in I guess I feel like that's one
thing that just finding what you're
gifted in whether it's like theater or
journalism or some kind of school
subject just find what you're interested
in when you go to college you kind of
have an idea of what you want to do and
just finding yourself in high school
it's important I feel like her for me
like I said I'm lucky to already people
to know what I want to do and it's been
really clear by god that this is what I
meant to do I feel like the next topic
that I want to address it's like your
friends coming from middle school and
how they are going to change people I
guess find their priorities but if you
don't agree with them people are gonna
change I don't have a lot of my friends
from middle school just because people
change and you've just got to be
accepting to that if your friends change
and they don't want to be friends with
you anymore
then you know you'll find more I promise
didn't think I was gonna make friends
that I valued as much as them and when I
did it came to realization that I was
really blessed that I have people still
supporting me and I've changed since
middle school gosh I've changed a lot I
don't really like to look upon the
middle school days let's just say that
I'm pretty sure everybody agrees with me
now you're gonna get judged I know they
like to say that people care less what
people think about them in high school
which I personally don't see that I feel
like people still care what you do not
as much in the middle school people
aren't as immature don't care what
people think about you they are gonna
judge you people who have judged me or
just like my videos and myself in
general but I just don't care because I
love what I do and
if you love what you do then don't
change it if it's bringing you benefits
I love YouTube YouTube is awesome for me
because I get to help you guys this
stuff and I get to film it edit which is
fun for me I love it
and I don't care what people think about
it because it's what I do and it's what
I love if you're not like somebody
they're gonna judge you and it's
unfortunate that our world works like
that but it's not gonna change so get
used to it
that sounds really harsh but I mean it's
not gonna change I feel like in high
school everybody's kind of the same they
wear the same things one person will be
wearing something one day and then
everybody's wearing to the next day and
it's out of time who's people in high
school I like to be the same and just
don't be like that you want to be and if
somebody judges you then who cares about
them doesn't matter so a lot of people
ask me if people know I make videos and
if I'm embarrassed about it and I'm
definitely not I'm basically everybody
who knows me knows it make videos people
who don't even know me know I make
videos they know me body like girl who
does YouTube videos mostly people think
it's cool they think it's a cool thing
and so if you do make videos don't be
barest about it people think it's
awesome
or the people I'm with you know there
are those people who think it's weird
but who cares about them in general
people don't agree with what you do then
who cares like I don't think it matters
my friend Sierra asked how can you be
cool as Sierra and just have swag and
the very last thing that I want to talk
about is about fitting in in the whole
fitting in thing in general and
something hard to address I don't really
know how to tell you guys the truth I'm
fitting in I think is a stupid concept
in high school you know you do have your
little cliche like you're a little puppy
with kids or jocks you're all that stuff
it's not really like the movies though
honestly you know it's not this whole
high school musical theme going on I
have friends from a lot of different
quote-on-quote groups you don't fit in
with specific group just find people who
you enjoy talking to even if they're not
from the same group again the whole
popular concept is just so stupid I hate
it who cares in four years when you're
supposed to be going to college and like
getting your life done who is gonna care
that you were the popular kid in high
school I don't in the hallways you'll
see them on like crowding around each
other it's just like I feel like you
should value hanging out with people
that you love because you love them not
just because they're popular I feel like
that's a way better concept to go with
versus try to be popular date the
hottest kid in the school and all that
now find who you enjoy being with and I
think that's the overall concept of this
whole video is
find who you want to talk to and who in
the end you are still gonna rely on so
that's our gonna in this video you can
email me or message me if you have any
other questions about just high school
in general like I said if it's about
freshmen like being scared and about
like lockers and hallways in first day
of school I will do a whole video on
that this is just like advice in general
for high school so yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this if you have any other
suggestions for advice videos or like
Michelle tells just comment them down
below and I'll see you as my next video
