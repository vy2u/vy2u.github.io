Michelle tells if you don't know what
those are these are just my advice
videos I literally get dozens and dozens
of comments just like eight help with
high school and you need help finding
friends I need help with this this is
all related to school and I decided to
finally just sit down I've honestly kind
of been procrastinating it because it's
such a big topic and I want to make sure
I include everything also I know a
little bit a complete mess I don't know
what's going on with this hair its face
and need to film this and I don't want
to do a beauty video so also I got my
good old friend of my bulletin board
right here i'm in the process of redoing
it and making it look all cute and stuff
as you can see I've been in a little
artsy mood lately I'm a freshman in high
school if you guys don't know I think
I've have enough advice as of right now
to do this video however scary you think
high school is gonna be tone that down
about five didn't make sense tone that
down a little bit it's really not scary
at all I mean I can see how he'd be
scared because I was scared I was like
oh I scored but you know I kind of got
used to it and the first topic I want to
talk about is just generally I'm finding
friends because I feel like that's a big
thing you know I'm coming from middle
school my middle school divided in half
half of us went to one school and half
of us went to the school I went to
there's also another middle school were
all of them went to my high school so
basically a lot of my friends went to
the high school that I didn't know there
was definitely a lot of different people
to meet I have like a few really close
friends I have like my five best friends
and my drill team I can generally say
that I really really am blessed to have
them i also have a few other friends out
of drill team i'm actually gonna be
doing a video with them soon i think
like wednesday so I'm really excited for
that but finding friends honestly middle
school I really didn't have a ton of
friends i'm just gonna be totally honest
with you guys i just i'm more person
who's kind of reserved I don't go out
there initiate conversations kind of
people if somebody came up and talked to
me I'd be like oh hey what's up like I
would totally be okay with that but like
I don't just initiate conversations I
mean I had a few like really close
friends that I was kind of it coming in
high school I think is a really good
time to meet people um I know this is
really cliche but joining some kind of
sport or something that you're
interested in really helps you if I
didn't join my drill team i literally
would have
five less really good friends and I have
more friends on their tooth but it's so
many people through that so many people
who share the same interests as me which
is really great because I feel like
whenever you share interest with people
it's a lot easier to make friends I
guess not saying that you can't have
friends that don't have the same
interests as you because I have a lot of
other friends who aren't the same as me
we need something is such a good way to
meet people whether that's like some
kind of language Club a sport real team
like me um I know some people did
Quidditch I would definitely recommend
it to make friends I don't know how to
say this but um if you're out there just
like I really make friends I'm gonna try
to make friends and you're just really
trying i would say kind of hold back a
little bit friends come naturally I
wouldn't say like I know it sounds kind
of Bab don't try to make friends it will
come naturally we'll just leave it up
for fate I guess you eventually meet
people and so you know what there's the
whole thing of seniority I know a lot
people be they're gonna get like bolita
by seniors in quotation marks that
doesn't really happen um what he does I
mean to senior do you think they're like
the top dogs like yeah let them have
their year of time and so the next topic
that I want to address is like grades
and stuff and staying organized that is
such a big thing going in high school it
is so much harder than middle school I
learned that I'm such like a type-a
person I like don't get a good grade on
something I kind of freaked out and it
kind of sucks um I never really was used
to getting B's an old school ever got
like any beyond anything I'd be like oh
my gosh end of the world I would say get
used to that high school is a lot harder
especially if you're taking honors or
pre AP classes which is what we call
them a lot harder you have a lot more
tests you have to study more it's
definitely more intense or at least for
me I shocked by how much harder it was
keep a planar keep organized of your
stuff I might do a separate video on
keeping organized you know stay on top
of things don't forget stuff these are
the years that are gonna help you get
into college so I just say focus pretty
much my grades I have like a bee in some
classes occasionally what just sucks and
I there or don't like it it bothers me I
actually had all a's this semester which
I was really heavy about yeah grades
aren't everything don't freak out that
much I know I'm such a hypocrite say
next I freaked out about everything take
classes that you're interested in that's
an
the thing high school has a lot more
classes offered early release mine does
I want to talk about is just like
learning who you are I guess this is so
cheesy giving I just said that you know
find what you enjoy I would say and find
what makes you happy I really love to
dance I really love drill team if you
seen like my little pom competition
routine i'll link in the downbar i love
to dance but that is armas not the thing
that I love the most what I'm doing
right now is what I love the most I love
filming I love editing it's what I want
to do when I grow up I want to be some
kind of film person with like editing
and stuff because I really enjoy it and
I'm lucky to find what I love and what I
gifted in I guess I feel like that's one
thing that just finding what you're
gifted in whether it's like theater or
journalism or some kind of school
subject just find what you're interested
in when you go to college you kind of
have an idea of what you want to do and
just finding yourself in high school
it's important I feel like her for me
like I said I'm lucky to already pretty
much to know what I want to do and it's
been really clear by God that this is
what i meant to do I feel like the next
topic that I want to address is like
your friends coming from middle school
and how they are going to change people
I guess find their priorities but if you
don't agree with them people are gonna
change I don't have a lot of my friends
from middle school just because people
change and you just got to be accepting
to that if your friends change and they
don't want to be friends with you
anymore then you know you'll find more I
promise didn't think I was going to make
friends that I valued as much as them
and when I did it came to realization
that I was really blessed that I have
people still supporting me and I've
changed since middle school gosh I've
changed a lot I don't really like to
look upon the middle school days let's
just say that i'm pretty sure everybody
agrees with me now you're gonna get
judged i know they like to say that
people care less what people think about
them in high school which i personally
don't see that I feel like people still
care what you do not as much in the
middle school people aren't as immature
don't care what people think about you
they are going to judge you people who
have judged me or just like my videos
and myself in general but I just don't
care because i love what i do and if you
love what you do then Joe
change it if it's bringing you benefits
I love YouTube YouTube is awesome for me
because I get to help you guys and stuff
and I get to film and edit which is fun
for me I love it and I don't care what
people think about it because it's what
I do and it's what I love if you're not
like somebody they're gonna judge you
and it's unfortunate that our world
works like that but it's not gonna
change so get used to it that sounds
really harsh but I mean it's not gonna
change I feel like in high school
everybody's kind of the same they wear
the same things one person will be
wearing something one day and then
everybody's wearing to the next day and
it's out of times people in high school
I'll like to be the same and just don't
be like that who you want to be and if
somebody judges you then who cares about
them doesn't matter so a lot of people
ask me if people know I make videos and
if I'm embarrassed about it and I'm
definitely not I'm basically everybody
who knows me knows that make videos
people who don't even know me know I
make videos they know me by like girl
who does YouTube videos mostly people
think it's cool then it gets a cool
thing and so if you do make videos don't
be embarrassed about it people think
it's awesome or the people i'm with you
know there are those people who think
it's weird but cares about them in
general people don't agree with what you
do then who cares like i don't think it
matters my friend sierra asked how can
you be cool SE era and just have swag
and the very last thing that I want to
talk about is about fitting in in the
whole fitting in thing in general and
something hard to address I don't really
know how to tell you guys the truth I'm
fitting in i think is a stupid concept
in high school you know you do have your
little cliche like your little popular
kids your jocks you're all that stuff
it's not really like the movies though
honestly you know it's not this whole
high school musical theme going on i
have friends from a lot of different
quote on quote groups you don't fit in
with specific group just find people who
you enjoy talking to even if they're not
from the same group again the whole
popular concept is just so stupid i hate
it who cares in four years when you're
supposed to going to college and like
getting your life done who is gonna care
that you were the popular kid in high
school I don't in the hallways you'll
see them all night crowding around each
other it's just like I feel like you
should value hanging out with people
that you love because you love them not
just you guys are popular I feel like
that's a way better concept to go with
versus trying to be popular date the
hottest kid in school and all that no
fine who you enjoy being with and I
think that's the overall concept of this
whole video is just
find who you want to talk to and who in
the end you are still going to rely on
so that's are going to end this video
you can email me or message me if you
have any other questions about just high
school in general like I said if it's
about freshman like being scared and
about like lockers and hallways in first
day of school I would do a whole video
on that this is just like advice in
general for high school so yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this if you have any
other suggestions for advice videos or
like Michelle tells just comment then
down below and I'll see you as I next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
