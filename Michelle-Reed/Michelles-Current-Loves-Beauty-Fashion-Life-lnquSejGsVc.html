of a favorites type video except i kinda
want to get more like my own instead of
something more basic I hardly ever do
favorites video so i decided to create
something just called like Michelle's
loves I'm gonna do that whenever I have
a lot of stuff to show you guys so will
be monthly or anything because I don't
always try out new things just whenever
I find a lot of new things I like I'm
gonna go ahead and show them to you guys
so I don't really want to have a super
long intro so let's just go ahead and
get into it especially going to start
out with like fashion favorites instead
of beauty because I want to make this my
own and so I'm going to start off with
swimsuits I have to to show you guys and
I showed this in my previous video both
these swimsuits the first one is from
H&amp;amp;M it looks like this it's this super
bright kind of pretty floral pattern i
don't think it's like a tacky floral
it's a really nice bando and what i love
about this is a lot of bandos don't stay
up on me but this one has kind of a
sticky type thing in it is really pretty
rough elite black mando which is really
classic and kind of it obsessed with
kind of solid black so because I think
they're really classy so I've been
loving this one it also stays on really
nicely and I believe it's from Erie so
yep I definitely love this one with it
approaching the end of the school year
I'm really kind of getting lazy with my
outfits and so I've kind of been going
for more comfort inn so I've been loving
these kind of loose hoodie type things
the first one is from brandy melville my
sister was actually gonna sell this I
was like
no and I took it and it's a super soft
small G hoodie and I just love to wear
this with like jeans and capris and
stuff and it's so comfy and i love it
and it's honestly the best thing ever i
also stole his hoodie from her and it's
this great kind of heather gray one I
guess and it's really just a comfy zip
up hoodie and I know it's really basic
but I've just been really loving these I
think this one is from forever 21 now if
you know anything about me I love love
love statement necklaces and I recently
found a new brand called Abby point and
I have two necklaces here to show you
guys the first one is this super pretty
kind of pink disc one and it has a cot
pink light pink and gold and it's so
pretty and I've been wearing this a lot
lately I think it's really simple and up
to out there it's kind of just a simple
statement necklace is really pretty a
teal mint colored one which is my
favorite color obviously and it's kind
of like a teardrop style and I've worn
this way more than I should have because
it's so cute i love it although these
are really well made and i'm not super
duper expenses so i will link Abby point
in the down bar and I definitely
recommend that you guys check it out if
you are a statement necklace fashionista
like so something else is i've recently
gotten glasses because i can never see
the board in any of my classes but they
look like this they're just kind of the
basic black ones that everybody's
wearing right now and they look like
this on I they'll like this and I really
like them and I can see so much clearer
when I put these on I haven't gotten
contacts yet just because I don't really
wants them but for now I'd sunglasses
and are like so those are all like my
fashion accessory type favorites so now
I'm going to move on to beauty things
the first thing I have is the Revlon
Photoready concealer is this really nice
thick creamy concealer and it's so
incredibly creamy and it covers my under
eye circles pretty well it also covers
blemishes which I love so you'll have to
use two different concealers because
that's annoying
and this one's really just easy to use
and I don't know I love it I've also
moved on to another mascara which is
pretty big step for me because I've
always been a lover of the rocket one
from Maybelline but I've got to say I
really been loving this one and it's the
covergirl clump crusher mascara and the
wand is kind of a curved one which I
love thron just really separates them
and makes them blog I don't know if it's
that great for volume but it definitely
makes them really long and separated
which I've kind of been like you more
than volume lately so that's what I want
today if you're wondering and I've
honestly just been looking this i lost
makeup favorite is the Rimmel London
airy-fairy lipstick and it is the
perfect kind of pinky nude color and
have it on right now and I absolutely
love it it's a great everyday lipstick
it smells like vanilla it smells really
good so I just really like it it's kind
of my new favorites buta lipstick I have
talked to Neil ball just to show you
guys and the first one is the urban
outfitters nail polish in love letter
and it's the perfect summer shade it's a
neon coral color and I wear this on my
toes constantly because it just looks
great it makes you look so tan which who
doesn't want to be tan let's be honest
here and so have this pure ice one in
home run and I knew stylehaul manager
actually sent this to me a while back
and I finally used it and it's the
perfect make green color it's so pretty
and it's so opaque which is not
something you find all the time and I've
just been loving it makes your nails
look really just clean and fresh and I
love a good Nick green nail polish that
definitely love this one and I
definitely recommend it so now I have
the fun part and that's going to be my
random favourites to the honey bunches
of oats crunchy honey roasted cereal now
this is my whole family's favorite so we
go through boxes of these within three
days because we all of the cereal and
every morning I basically have a bowl of
this like a bagel or no
Eagle if you know I need to cut that out
some days but i really really love the
cereal because it really fills you up in
the morning because I'm like going to
school hungry and this just tastes great
fills me up and it's just been my
favorite now i also have a book and this
is the explicit gospel by Matt Chandler
and this is such a great book I'm just
going to be honest I am a Christian and
just like this book and I know a lot of
my followers are also Christians I
decided to share this but I read a
couple pages of this every morning and I
use it as my devotional and it's been
just my favorite devotional I've ever
done and it's such a great book and I
love it so much and it's just such a
great books i definitely recommend this
if you want a good devotional book
couple more random favourites I have
loved fresh flowers I feel like I've
always had fresh flowers in my room for
the past month or so or a couple months
the ones I have right now are absolutely
beautiful my boyfriend actually give
them to me and they're so pretty and
they make me so happy like I know fake
flowers are kind of like something
people wife but I just they're not the
same I love fresh flowers also another
thing I love is meeting you guys because
recently i've met a lot of just
subscribers and fans in public and it is
the coolest thing ever if anybody's ever
met some of their viewers it is the
coolest thing ever and i love seeing you
guys and I know sometimes I'm kind of
awkward because I'm just an awkward
person but it really makes my day and I
cherish those moments more than anything
