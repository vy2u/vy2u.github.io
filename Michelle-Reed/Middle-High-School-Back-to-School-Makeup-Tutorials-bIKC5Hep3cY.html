hi guys today I'm here to do both a
middle school and a high school makeup
tutorial with all drugstore products
because I know with back-to-school
season you have to buy new clothes new
makeup new school supplies and they can
really add up like trust me it adds up
if you happen to be new to my channel
definitely subscribe right now you will
see all the rest right back to school
videos which are coming right after this
one and I am what every Sunday and
Thursday so it would mean a lot if you
subscribe to me if your middle school or
high school you wear more or less makeup
than I showed in this video that's okay
you can definitely change these around
to fit you personally this is just what
I would wear in middle school and then
what I kind of wear right now and I'm in
high school so with all that said if you
want to skip to the high school makeup
tutorial go to this time because I'm
gonna do the middle school lunch first
and yeah let's just go ahead and get
into the video so first we are starting
off with the middle school makeup look
which is a little more light and fresh
I'm starting off by mixing both my
covergirl Ready Set gorgeous and the
moisturizer that I'm using together just
because this creates a tinted
moisturizer which is a lot lighter than
a foundation I'm then going and adding
some brightness to my under eyes by
using my instant age rewind brightener
you can also cover up any blemishes you
may have just right now my skin is doing
pretty well
then I'm just setting everything with my
Rimmel stay matte powder in translucent
cream blushes are great because they are
a lot more natural and they look really
fresh on the skin so I'm using my
favorite one by NYX which is in the
shade natural I'm priming my eyes with
that concealer that I used earlier and
then I'm going in with this palette by
Wet n Wild called comfort zone and I'm
using the kind of peachy shimmery color
all over my lid and then in the crease
I'm using the topi crease color with a
very light hand then I am highlighting
under my brow and in my tear duct with
this light cream colored shade then I'm
using the maroon II brown shade and I'm
using this as an eyeliner because using
eyeshadows eyeliners a lot less harsh
than actually going in with eyeliner
then I am curling my eyelashes and
applying my covergirl clump crusher
mascara
and lastly we are finishing off the look
with this maybelline color elixir lip
gloss and caramel infused which is a
really pretty natural pink color and
that is it for the middle school makeup
tutorial
now this high school makeup tutorial is
a little bit more than the middle school
makeup tutorial and it's something that
I would wear to high school I am using
my covergirl Ready Set gorgeous
foundation with a Beauty Blender because
there's really no drugstore dupe for
this it's just an awesome sponge and
then I'm going in with my Maybelline age
rewind concealer it's the brightener one
to brighten underneath my eyes we are
then setting all of the face makeup with
the Rimmel stay matte powder in
translucent as a blush I'm using this
pixie shade and subtly suntouch which is
actually a bronzer but I feel like it's
a little too pink to be a bronzer so I'm
using it as a blush I'm then going in
with my wet and wild rose golden goddess
highlighter and I'm using this to my
cheekbones because it adds a very nice
Sheen and it's really pretty I'm also
using my NYX brow pencil which I'm gonna
be honest this is a little oranjee and
not the best drugstore brow pencil but I
mean it gets the job done just not the
best that I would like then I'm using my
wet and wild comfort zone palettes and
using the peachy shimmery shade I'm
applying this all over the lid we are
then blending the taupe shade into the
crease to add a little bit of definition
and then mixing the maroon e brown color
in the olive color I'm applying this to
my outer corner and blending a lot
because as you can see it needs a lot of
blending and then I'm mixing both the
brow bone shades and applying this under
my brows and to the inner tear-duct
then I'm using my L'Oreal a-near intense
eyeliner I'm doing a pretty thin line
and then curling my eyelashes and
applying my L'Oreal miss manga mascara
which I really like spend my favorite
recently and that is it for the eyes I'm
then finishing off with this Rimmel Kate
Moss lipstick in the number eight which
is a nice natural pink color and then I
am putting some gloss over it this is
the Maybelline elixir one and caramel
and whew
and that is it for the high school
makeup tutorial so I hope this video
gave you guys two looks that you can
maybe use going back to school I had a
lot of fun filming this video like
always and definitely liked it if it
gave you some tips my last video was a
video about all about how to be
productive because productivity is the
key so you should definitely go watch
that video I showed some fun activities
tips light packs all that good stuff and
I'll see you guys my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
