can do to my channel you should
definitely subscribe Klima ye off this
video I asked you guys if you would like
to see this video in so many of these I
said that you wanted to so I decided to
do it instead any video I'm going to
show you guys my favorite bondage
swimsuits now I want to say that
everyone kind of defines modesty in
different terms so in this video I'm
just showing you guys swim suits that
make me comfortable and confident
they're mostly high-waisted swimsuits
and then one pieces I think those are
probably like the cutest modest
swimsuits I could find I've been seeing
a lot of trial hallo videos of some
things that I did personally wouldn't
feel comfortable in I think there's a
huge trend of them on YouTube so if you
guys are like me and you do like more
high waisted swimsuits and one-piece
swimsuits I think this video is perfect
Altamonte trying these on because I
figured out that there are very creepy
people in the internet I don't really
want videos of me in a swimsuit on the
Internet just my personal preference I
have posted a few of these on Instagram
if you want to check that out you can
follow me on there I posted like a
couple of them there I think that's
everything nice to say I also don't have
a ton of swimsuits so this isn't going
to be a long video I should go ahead and
get into it so the first designer to
show you guys are from Old Navy and
these are high waisted swimsuits the
first one is just a hot pink and leaf
pattern I think so backwards I think
it's so cute the colors are so so bright
and has little beads on them I just
think that these are adorable and are
very very hard because they are highly
specific EEP everything in which is why
I really like them top 4 this one is
kind of just your average kind of like
broad type thing I like it if it does go
down a little bit more it's also not
super push up so I don't really like
push ups in terms of something they're
comfortable it's something very
supportive and just comfortable
this next one suit is basically the same
one in a different pattern I know a lot
of you guys are crazy about this week
pattern right now I think it's so cute I
love green it just has little palm tree
leaves things on them these those are
also high waisted and then the top for
this one to just look like this it's
just the same talk but have straps that
you can review if you're canning which I
really like if you're wondering about
sizing I got both of these in a size
small and I think that they fit
absolutely perfect
I think it's hot maybe a little bit big
but it definitely still works I think a
small book these really fitting well
this one-piece swimsuit is definitely my
favorite one piece I have ever gotten
I've got this
Dillard's it is the brain Becca by
Rebecca virtue it's just black and then
the side has these little slits on it
which are really miss grief they're not
like too flashing or anything they're
just enough to make your hips look nice
and then in the fact it just has an open
back which i think is really adorable
this is also really comfortable if
you're swimming I think black swimsuits
are so so flattering and as when I got
this size media my legs are a little bit
longer and so one-piece swimsuits
usually fit you better third size medium
I also have this one from Target which
is also one of my favorites it has a
little cold all over it but then in the
center it's kind of just normal and then
in the back it also has a hole so it was
kind of hard to show so I'll insert a
picture of this one but I think this is
adorable target has such cute
inexpensive swimsuits if you're looking
for some I got this one I decide
smallish because I found it fit me
better I know I said like medium soon if
it means if you want a small I don't
know a lot of the airy high-waisted
bonus if you're looking for some more
this is just a pair that I have that
it's just Coral simple highly sivanna's
and then it has slight ruching on the
hip which i think is a nice touch almost
looks like a little bow or something
when you're wearing it I also got these
in a size small area swimsuits are
adorable they have so many cute one
pieces you should definitely check them
out for the top I just have this black
top which is really simple it's a little
bow in the center this wise in the size
32 see because they do it by your for
all sides not necessarily like this in
suicide so I think this one is really
cute these next two are actually my
sister's but she got them from Cup she
which I know it's like one of those
sites were it looks sketchy some
swimsuits are cute and actually fit and
she loves me she also is really cute and
I'm so excited to show them just for
reference if you want some more
inexpensive swimsuit this one is a
one-piece and I think it is absolutely
adorable it has the prettiest floral
pattern and then it is just a one-piece
the hips kind of go up a little higher
which I think are cute and then the back
is completely open it just ties at the
top this one went a little bit more
lower cut she actually sewed it up a
little bit higher and so it would be
like more different taste it looks so
good on her still have this little make
down below I believe this is a size
medium she also got this top from cup
she which I thought was really cute I
decided to show and he just wears it
with black
so she doesn't have special bottoms it's
a little bit more covering and then it
just has a band in the back and it's
high in the top and she's really tanned
so these colors look really good on her
if you're looking for something that's a
little bit more comfortable it's almost
like a sports bra which I feel like is
also great if you are like in the water
or something so those are all some suits
that I have to show you guys I'll have a

swimsuit in this video with your
