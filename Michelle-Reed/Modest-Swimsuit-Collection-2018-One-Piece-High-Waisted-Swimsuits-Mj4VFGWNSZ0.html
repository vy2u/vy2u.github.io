because it is gonna be doing something a
little bit different over the summer I
posted a modest swimsuit collection
showing you guys like one-piece
swimsuits and high-waisted swimsuits and
you guys really seemed to like it and so
I wanted to bring you guys another one
and if you're wondering why I'm posting
this in February it's because I know a
lot of you guys are probably going on
spring break trips and I thought that it
would be a good time in case you want to
order any swimsuits before I do this
video I want to give a major disclaimer
because I know this is like maybe
controversial for some people basically
where I'm coming out with this video is
I see a lot of like swimsuit collection
videos and try on haul videos of
swimsuits that I don't feel like some
woman would feel comfortable wearing and
so I want to offer swimsuits that maybe
make people feel more confident make
people feel more comfortable I'm not
saying that people who wear swimsuits
that are different than this are wrong I
think that women feel empowerment in
very different ways I'm just giving
other options of women who may feel more
empowered wearing like one-piece or
high-waisted swimsuit I am not attacking
anyone
I am literally just trying to give you
guys options I know a lot of girls out
there really liked my last video and so
I'm just doing this again for that
purpose please don't get upset with me
coming up this with a perspective of I
want to help women be confident and I
want to give options and that's all I'm
doing I hope when you're watching this
video you just have grace with me and
understand what I'm trying to do in this
video I'm not trying to attack anyone
also if you're new you should Emily
subscribe my name is Michelle Rina I've
also been vlogging a lot on my second
channel if you want to check it out it's
Michelle out of your shell I post vlogs
like three times a week I want to start
off with the ones that I'm most excited
for if you guys know albian fit is a
really really cute swimsuit company and
they asked me if I wanted to receive
some suits to check out and if I liked
that I could put them in a video so this
isn't sponsored I just love these
swimsuits they are adorable they're
handmade their ethical II made it's just
a really cool company and so I'm going
to show you guys how we all define
modesty different I'm not saying that my
definition is right by this video's
title
I mean I'm showing you guys one-piece
swimsuits and like high-waisted bottoms
it's not something you'd be more
comfortable I'm not trying to tack
anyone Stephanie
I'm just trying to title this video
somewhere to where I'm attracting the
right audience of this one which I think
is my favorite it's a two-piece but I
got this striped top which i think is so
cute it's like one sided its stripes
it's bottoms which are just high-waisted
blue and white striped bottoms and this
is so comfortable this one's definitely
my favorite I will put a picture of the
model wearing it right here I'm not
gonna try these on in this video I might
turn on the one-pieces but I don't feel
comfortable trying on to pieces on
videos if you're wondering about sizing
because these are expensive suits
I gotta size extra small if you're
wanting for sizing if you're about the
same size as me and that is also a part
of their new collection which is their
Aloha connection and all these suits are
adorable they're so cute I got this one
piece which is like an off-the-shoulder
floral one-piece it's a beautiful coral
color that'll make you look so tan and
it kind of like bushes in the front and
has off the shoulder straps which are
cute and you think would be kind of
uncomfortable but honestly they're
really comfy and they don't like slide
down a lot I really really like them but
this one is so pretty it is so
flattering guys they're starting to make
one pieces that are just so adorable and
flattering and so I really like this one
I also got this one and an extra small
if you're wondering I also have a coupon
code I will put it right here you get
15% off I believe it's like Michelle or
Michelle Reed but I will make sure to
insert it right here because I know
these suits are a little bit pricier but
it's also because they're really nice
quality and they are ethically made
which is something I think we should be
supporting this one which is probably my
second favorite this is a part of their
new aloha collection but it is just pink
little polka dots
it's high-waisted bottoms and they have
white coconuts on them and so these are
the bottoms and then the top cross at
the front little table it has a little
bow in it in the back it like crosses
and this is such a flattering swimsuit
this totally gives me like 50s vibes I
think that these are so adorable
together and with like a really good tan
this is gonna be so cute I also got
these both in an extra small if you're
wondering I just think that this is
adorable and the last one I have from
Albion Fit is
they're SuperDuper cute one piece but it
just has these little stripes on it
they're like a coral color it has a
little cutout at the stomach and then
the bottom has these adorable little
like orange clementines on them and then
it has two tides at the back I think
that this is so cute the ties in the
back are so adorable and so girly but
it's also so comfy because honestly
whatever you're at the beach you want to
be comfortable and confident and I think
that this is a swimsuit that just really
makes me confident and if you're
wondering about sizing I also got this
and an extra small so while I personally
think those swimsuits are amazing and if
you're going to buy one suit I would
definitely invest in Albion because they
are pricey but they are such good
quality and know their girls out there
who probably have like smaller budgets
and so I wanted to show you guys a
couple other options that I like these
are from airy from American Eagle I love
airy they have really great swim suits
as well if you're looking for something
on the cheaper side I think Erie's great
I got this one piece which almost looks
like a little picnic it's like plaid and
it has little ruffles on the side if you
can tell and then the back is basically
completely exposed and it like crosses
in the back it definitely comes up
higher on the hips if you're into duck
to wear it like cuts up higher it
definitely makes your legs look really
long and it's really flattering but I
love this one I think bright colors and
swimsuits are adorable and so I
definitely recommend checking this one
this last one is definitely a little bit
more scandalous if that's the word I
didn't really think it was gonna be like
this but it is so if you are someone who
like likes more different swimsuits I
think this one's cute it's a striped
suit and it has a super super low cut so
I think if you're someone who doesn't
have that's going in the chest area this
would be really flattering because it is
so low-cut and also kind of like cuts on
the side so it's pretty open up the
sides and then the bottom is just
striped and again this one goes up
really high on the hips and then the
back basically just just the back so I
really like this one it's definitely a
little bit more showy than I prefer and
I didn't realize that it looks a lot
different on the model and it does on me
but I still really like this
- if you're interested albian link down
below and I'll also have those two
American Eagle suits if you want to
check them out I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video again this isn't
sponsored I just love these suits and I
think that we should be a lifting woman
in the ways that they feel confident and
this is me giving people options and so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video if
you're going anywhere for spring break
let me know down below because I would
love to see what cool vacations you're
going on even if you're staying at home
I'm going home and I'm so excited I love
you guys and I'll see you guys in my
next video bye friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
