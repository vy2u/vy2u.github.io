hazy glow your bones no shell but I can
see Stephanie as you fall to me I can
skip a beat count 1 2 3 hi there my name
is Michelle Rhee didn't say I'm going to
be doing my morning routine for 2016 I
haven't done one of these videos for
such a long time and I'm super excited
for you guys to watch this video if you
happen to be new to my channel you
should definitely subscribe I upload all
the Sundays and Thursdays and this video
is kind of a good taste of what most of
my videos are like I also feel like I
haven't shouted out my social media in a
while so if you guys want to follow me
on Instagram or Twitter my Instagram is
Michelle Reed and my twitter is Michelle
Reed YT if you'd like to follow me I
definitely post some fun pictures and
stuff and you guys just get to know me
more on those platforms so if you're
into that definitely do that and yeah
without further ado we're just going to
go ahead and get into video so this is
more of my weekend morning routine so I
typically wake up around 8:30 or 9:00 on
the weekdays it'll be like 6 a.m. then I
wake up if only it was actually this
joyfully that's just because Connor was
filming and then I will grab a book I'm
currently reading this book which is on
habits and developing good habits and I
think it's really important before
starting your day just to get a good
word in and this is really good to start
my day off with because it's about
having good habits and it's really
helpful for having a good day so I'll
have it linked down below and then I
will go ahead and get out of bed I
always make my bed in the morning no
matter what because I cannot start my
day without making sure my bed is nice
and arranged isn't even a lie guys I
promise I always make my bed and then I
will head over into the living room and
I will play with Roxy Roxy is my German
Shepherd dog she is adorable and
literally just like the happiest dog in
the world and so I always like to play
with her in the morning because it pumps
me up for the day I always start my
morning off with some skincare I think
it's so important to prep your skin
before applying makeup so I'm using my
ultra Repair wash from first day Beauty
they actually sent me this and I've been
trying it out and it's so good if you
have dry skin you have to try this it
really moisturizes my skin and I will
just moisturize my skin with my simple
moisturizer I'm all about using products
that are gentle and not harsh and don't
have
ton of chemicals in them and so I love
the simple products and this isn't
sponsored or anything by them I just
really really love this moisturizer and
I love skincare in general then of
course I have to brush my teeth in the
morning so I'll go ahead and do that and
then I just head on over into the
kitchen to grab some coffee I usually
make these Starbucks darkest Peru in the
morning I like to have some while I do
my makeup I also drink about a cup of
water as well because I think it's
really important I add some soy milk
into my coffee and then I'll take that
to do my makeup I'll either catch up on
some YouTube videos or watch a good
documentary while I do my makeup I'm not
going to go into depth about my makeup
and what exactly I'm doing because I
just didn't everyday makeup routine I'll
have it linked on the screen right here
and down below but I basically just do
something pretty natural and like an
everyday look my makeup usually consists
of some foundation some peachy color
blush and mauve eyeshadow and there's
Gunnar because he was helping me film
and yeah that's basically it for hair I
just added some wave with a wand I
usually don't curl my hair but today I
was just kind of feeling it so I went
ahead and curled my hair and then for
breakfast I just chopped up an apple and
I added some cinnamon on top and then I
also portable of honey bunches of oats
cereal with some soy milk
I love the cereal and this Apple
combination it's so good i watch a lot
of morning routines that people don't
typically eat a lot for breakfast but I
always like to eat a big meal because
it's the most important meal and I
really like feeling satisfied for my
outfit I'm wearing something pretty
plain it was super hot in Texas today so
I just have on a Madewell tank top with
some black Jaime jeans from Topshop a
purse from a thrift store my necklace is
for my grandma my favorite Daniel
Wellington watch and the super cute
platform shoes from Nine West they're
not everyone's cup of tea I understand
but they're super comfy and they add a
lot to the outfit
so that is it for my morning routine
definitely let me know if you guys
