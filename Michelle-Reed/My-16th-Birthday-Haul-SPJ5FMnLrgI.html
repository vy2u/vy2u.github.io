give me SEC
hi guys I'm so excited to do this video
because it's going to be my birthday
haul when I mentioned to you guys that
it was my birthday on July 1st
everybody requested a birthday haul so
I'm just doing this because you guys
want it I'm not trying to brag by any
means thank you guys all so much for
being so sweet to me on my birthday and
sending me all these incredible birthday
wishes you guys are the best and I love
you guys
also I want to mention that while you
are watching this I am in Ohio so I'm
sorry if the videos have been slow I'm
still going to be posting while I'm
there but they won't be as frequent as I
haven't uploading so first I'm going to
start off with the gifts that I got from
my family um my present for my mom was
first I got myself piercing done I
actually went to a tattoo parlor for the
first time and got it done and it was
awesome I think I'm gonna enter the
footage right here
that's your good side
it's just a ring and I think it's really
nice I've been wanting to do it for a
while so I'm so happy that I finally got
it done my parents also bought me this
watch it's a fall so watch and it's gold
and it has tortoise shell around the
middle of it fossil watches are my
absolute favorite just because they're
very simple but they're very classy and
they're like the Michael Kors watches
but a lot cheaper so definitely love
this so thank you thank you so much to
my parents my mom also got me this super
cool card with the camera I just thought
it was awesome like look how awesome
this card is my sister Lindsey also got
me a necklace so this is kind of the
birthday of jewelry if you know what I'm
saying it was from Kendra Scott she got
me this really pretty mint green at one
it's a very delicate necklace with just
a simple stone and I don't have any
simple jewelry I kind of only have these
really big statement necklaces so I'm so
happy that she bought this for me so my
sister Jamie bought me an Amazon gift
card because she knows I love Amazon
it's my addiction she also got me two
pairs of dangly earrings from
Francesca's the first one is just like a
teal and blue and maybe very pretty set
and then this one is just a very simple
whites here I actually already have
these ones in a mate green and I wear
them all the time so she got me the same
ones and this really neat white to color
and then lastly she got this idea from -
Sarah Bell but she made me a sixteen
years of ratchet book so it's basically
like all of my embarrassing pictures up
to 16 so that it was a great geminus
honestly it's so cute and I love it and
it's such a good idea for birthday
present so my boyfriend Gunnar actually
got me the coolest gift ever he bought
me a pair what is called a Polaroid
camera and I was so so happy to get this
cuz it's so cool I love the idea that
you can just take a picture and
immediately prints out and they look
very very cool he also bought me a
couple things on film so I'm set for
when I am at Ohio so I can take some
pretty awesome pictures
thank you thank you so much god this is
such a cool gift and it makes me so
happy because now I could take a really
cool polaroid pictures he also got me
these super cute little light-up bow
thingies which I got at the fireworks
that I went to last I their door yes so
now onto the gifts from my friends my
friend Megan stopped by which I will
insert a picture of her right here and
she gave me this really really pretty
necklace and it's like a turquoise
design type thing I don't really want to
describe it so I'm just gonna insert a
clip then yeah that's what it looks like
yes oh no you can't no because she knows
I'm obsessed with candles and this one
is the province garden I love it I
already used burned it as you can see
and it's a very floral light scent for
something when you don't really want
your room to smell like your boyfriend
you want it to smell like flowers then
my friend Katie made me a sign she also
got this idea from Sarah Bell but it
looks like this it's just an M design
and it has a bunch of different words
that describe me so this was so sweet
and I know this had to take her so long
so thank you so much Katie I cannot wait
to put this up on my wall just one
doesn't love candy so she got me some
sour patch kids and some Hershey's and
also some sweet tarts but I've already
so that my sister's boyfriend Ben it got
me a card and if you've ever seen Parks
and Rec you know this reference it says
clothes treat yo'self fragrances treat
yo self massage it to treat yourself
starburst vanilla iced coffee treat
yourself and then he also got me a
Starbucks gift card and photo this is so
sweet
cuz he definitely didn't have to give me
anything so thank you thank you so much
Ben your also does everything that I
received for my birthday up again thank
you guys so much for wishing me happy
