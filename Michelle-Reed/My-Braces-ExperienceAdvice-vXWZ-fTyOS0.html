my braces off
I've had them on since January of 2011
not to go so there's no teeth last time
you'll see me with these hopefully we
have mom's take me and yeah it's about
11:30 and yeah I'll see you guys
afterwards deuces
hi guys I don't know if you notice
anything different about me or anything
but yeah I got my braces off here just
to tell you guys my experience or
whatever I guess I think that's what
they call these videos so basically I
have my braces on from January 13th of
2011 I know I remember the exact date
I'm a nerd - January 23rd of 2013 my mom
for a little over two years but not too
much first thing I'm gonna talk about is
getting them on honestly it's no big
deal basically they just blow air on
your teeth because they have to be dry
and that kind of hurt me cuz I've really
sensitive teeth and then they put your
brackets on and the glue kinda seems
like pickles I was a little weird but
honestly it wasn't that bad I also have
to like keep your mouth open with these
little things and you're like ah and it
kind of feels weird yeah and my lady was
like you had a lot of saliva so she got
like stick cotton in my mouth and that
was a very comfortable but overall
honestly it wasn't even that bad like I
don't remember the process in the next
few days that you have your braces your
teeth will be a little sore everybody's
like oh my reasons / I was never like
that I mean I think the night that I got
my braces I was like ah Roscoe hurts but
then come one away so don't be too
scared about that so in the process of
actually having your braces I guess you
know just make sure you do the basic
things like brushing your teeth they say
to floss never flossed and I think I
turned out fine and you might gum this
are a little swollen but it's honestly
not that big of a deal I was watching
some girls like braces video just like
I've lost twice a day every day and I'm
like really I don't know anybody who
would do that
do you like I'm so chill in this but it
just wasn't that big of a deal for me if
you get rubber bands wear your rubber
bands um that was one thing I was like
I'm gonna do because I was like I'm not
having these on for four years I'm gonna
get him off when I'm supposed to so I
wore my rubber bands every day that I
was supposed to I actually got to like
stop having to wear them because I wore
them like the amount of time I was
supposed to I guess so that was really
good and yeah just make sure you wear a
beard to wear your rubber bands like the
amount of time
was 2 a.m. yeah he'll be fine so now I'm
on the process of getting them off and I
just want to say my experience was
terrible terrible and like big red bold
letters so bad I let's just go over this
so before I start I want to say that
this tooth I chipped when I was 9 years
old let's just go over the story I was
about nine sacked up some home depot
buckets and I tried to slam him dunk
Home Depot buckets fell over I fell
cracked my tooth in half and yeah that
was all under my brother Jordan
supervision so yeah when I got my braces
on I had my filling in or whatever kind
of time for me to get a new filling but
I couldn't get it till I got my braces
off it was kind of starting to turn a
little brown but it wasn't that bad I
was just like whatever and the bracket
was holding it together I guess and I
guess some junk got in there and whatnot
and when I got my braces off that tooth
is literally brown like I don't know if
I'll insert a picture because it's kind
of gross but it was completely Brown and
I was just like
getting them off they have to like stick
this thing to get the brackets off and
they like twist and it sounds like
they're cracking your teeth it is
terrible I was like this on my shirt the
whole time I was like I didn't really
hurt just had a lot of pressure and it
felt like they're cracking your teeth so
I was like gonna don't crack my teeth
feels really slimy and gross because of
it glues on there they will polish your
teeth and they just go with this little
thing and it honestly hurt makes a
really sensitive teeth and they're like
blowing air or whatever so then they get
to the like retainer part I don't want
to talk about this brings back bad
memories make you mine a maintainer
basically they have this metal thing and
they fill it with this a glue gun they
stick it in your mouth or whatever and
like get your top and bottom teeth so
not only do you have to do this once you
have to do this twice so the bottom line
goes pretty well I'm like don't gag
Michelle you're okay he just comes up
sticks the top one and I started gagging
and coughing and I'm like if I set the
robin she's like the Walker did spit
like everywhere so finally she took it
out and I ran to the scene had the blue
stuff all over my hair was all over my
face my shirt was wet my tooth was brown
and I just had a meltdown I started
crying I was like oh my gosh Michelle
not know not now but you know cheers
would come in and I started crying and I
calmed down for like two minutes and
then she come at me again and it was
still kind of bad but I got it done but
that's gonna scare you or anything but
my experience was not very good for
getting them off I actually have an
amazing dentist I love my dentist he got
me in within like an hour to fix my
tooth and he just got a new filling and
so literally this tooth is like all fake
overall I am very glad that I got braces
I feel like my teeth are so much
straighter than they were yeah so if you
are scared about getting braces don't be
your experience won't be as bad as mine
you will have brown teeth or you won't
gag and spit everywhere you'll be fine
don't worry about it and if you have any
more questions or just comments to make
make sure to comment them down below and
I'll see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
