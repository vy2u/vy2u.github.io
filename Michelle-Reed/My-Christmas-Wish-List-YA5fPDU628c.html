history notes so that's not my list hi
guys today I'm going to be doing a video
and this is going to be my Christmas
wish list video which I want to say
disclaimer because I really did not want
to do this because I honestly I see
where people get angry and get bad and
they're like why are you so spoiled
you're doing a video about everything
you wants like who does that
I just decided to do this because it was
something that was requested so if it
was me I would not do this but it was
requested so I decided to do it so
please don't get mad at me I am NOT just
trying to sit here and say everything I
want this is just something that was
requested
I don't really ask for a lot of things
for Christmas because I just don't like
to and so this video is not going to be
very long so with all that stuff being
said I'm just going to go ahead and get
started so the first thing that is on my
list is a new lens and I said this in my
past video but it is a Sony 8:35 50
millimeter lens hello kitty and so films
her look books with the 50 millimeter
lens and they are so good and I love it
the quality's amazing and so I just want
one of these lens I actually ordered it
for myself like my mom is like Michelle
order it so she's gonna be mad at me
saying this but I'm gonna be filming a
lookbook after Christmas and I'm very
very excited because the standard one is
okay but I just kind of want to make my
videos better and a quality better and
so I decided that I wanted second thing
that I want is probably the most basic
thing that anybody could say but it is
the naked 3 palette I know I'm very
basic but I have the naked 1 palette and
I use it everyday I've been using it a
lot recently this month and I love the
eyeshadows in there but they're all kind
of dark in like bronzy and so
I only use the lighter ones in the
beginning but this one is a rose gold
eyeshadow and they're so pretty I'm not
just saying that because it's new that
everybody's getting it I wanted to I
actually want it because the eyeshadows
are rose gold and that's like my color I
love to wear those until I'm very very
excited for that I don't really buy like
nice makeup for myself I kind of just
find drugstore stuff because it's easy
to get it's cheap and I don't like to
spend a lot of money on makeup so that's
kind of just something that's kind of
nice to get because it is something that
men don't get to buy myself usually her
thing would be books I don't read a lot
I've heard that John Green is a really
good author he wrote two books Looking
for Alaska and The Fault in Our Stars
I've heard that those are both really
good books and I'm kind of wanting to
read those my god by those after
Christmas but I really want those two
books because I like to read books but I
kind of wish I had more time but if I
could get those two books I would just
be so hot me because I'm reading which
is good and I need to read more the more
thing would be coffee mugs I'm a coffee
addict I love it so much and I think
that cute like coffee mugs are just
something that's nice to have my friend
Rose actually gave me one it's sitting
over there but don't want to get it so
but cute coffee mugs are just awesome I
every every single morning I sit and I
drink my cup of coffee before practice
and it's just something I do and I love
it also just coffee in general is a good
gift
I'm Keurig which is the most amazing
thing which is the most amazing thing
and you just have little cups and you
brew your cups and it makes your coffee
awesome but I just love trying out new
coffees and teas and everything and it's
so much fun and so just new coffees or
keys or something in coffee mugs would
be great because I'm a coffee lover and
add it so the next thing I want is it
really something that I like absolutely
need or anything but I kind of want a
new jacket I have a North Face but it's
kind of shrinking almost I feel like so
I've had about one of those green like
military type jackets you talk about if
I insert a picture what I'm talking
about but I've seen some on Urban
Outfitters that are so cute and so I
feel like I want to buy it with some of
my Christmas money because they're so
cute I just want a different jacket than
my North Face because everybody has know
our faces and yeah they're also but I
don't know I've seen people wear those
green ones and they're very very cute
like my friend Emily or that fashion
grocery she has one and it's so cute and
I envy it and so I might just go ahead
and buy one of those for myself because
they're pretty cute that is everything
that's on my wish list this year I know
it's kind of small my video but I don't
really have that many things that I want
and I kind of wanted to keep this short
and simple because I feel like that's a
good thing to do so yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this make sure to leave anything
that's on your wish list this year down
below or you know you could post a video
response or you can tweet me or whatever
you want I'd love to hear what's on your
wish list cuz that's fun to do and I'll
see you guys in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
