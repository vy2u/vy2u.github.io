film this intro outside to be super cute
with nature and then I remember that
nature means bees do I came inside I
hope you guys are ok with that today I'm
doing a complete spring hair outfit and
makeup essentials kind of video because
I already did a spring makeup store
which you can see right here or that
below but there are a few products that
I've really been loving for springtime
so I decided to throw them into this
video if you recreate this hair look or
makeup look or outfit or anything make
sure to follow me on Twitter and
Instagram and sweet me a picture also I
wanted to mention that in my last video
I actually have a giveaway so you should
definitely go enter that I'll have it
linked down below and at the end of this
video I believe that is everything I
really have to tell you guys so I hope
you enjoy give this a like and let's go
ahead and get into it so I love my
smashbox primer water this Prime's my
face for makeup and it also makes me
feel very refreshed also love my laura
geller primer in champagne because it
gives me a nice glow because it has some
shimmer in it also really been digging
this tart blush in peaceful it's a very
pretty kind of shimmery coral color it's
beautiful and then as a highlight I've
been using this laura geller bakes duo
and rome in milan my maybelline great
lash mascara has been a staple just
because it's very simple when it gives a
very clean defined look to your lashes
and then lastly i've been loving my
revlon colorstay moisture stain and para
SI and passion it was not
this drunk Muppet now it is time for the
hair look so i'm using my nume curling
iron and i used two different barrels
both the 19 millimeter in the 25 so I
just put my hair back and did the bottom
layers with you 25 first because these
don't really have to be too defined and
I actually burned myself and it hurt
really bad she was crossed again she
told me I then switched the barrel to
the smaller one and I did this to my top
section of my hair and I kind of curled
from the roots because I found that this
gave me a lot of volume as you can see
and then I just scrunched it with some
hairspray so it was super crazy and
voluminous for the rope braid basically
you just part your hair like a little
section in the top split it in half and
then you twist to the right on the right
side and then go over top the other
piece grab a piece twist that one to the
right and repeat and go over the next
one so sounds kind of confusing but it's
actually a really easy braids I think
it's easier than French braiding and
it's kind of a messy boho look I think
it's super cute then I just secured it
and loosen it up because I love
everything really loose in my hair and
then I took the two pieces and I kind of
just twirl them around each other like I
would in a normal rope ride and then I
just secured it and that was it for the
hairstyle super boho and cute
so my romper is actually from choice
i'll have it linked down below i love it
because it's super flowy and the
pom-poms are adorable and I love
sunflowers so it's just so springy my
little denim cardigan is from urban
outfitters it's really soft I love it
and then these booties are also from
choice I thought they kind of made this
outfit a little more edgy and then my
teal necklace is from Kendra Scott's in
the golden one is actually for my
grandma so that's pretty much it for my
outfit
so that is everything for this complete
spring look really hope you guys enjoyed
this let me know some video requests
that you guys have because recently i've
really been stuffed with like not
knowing what you guys want it's kind of
just like an awkward filming time but I
love your requests in your comments and
your likes and everything else so
definitely leave all of that jazz down
below and I'll see you guys my next
video bye got a little salt is cocoa
