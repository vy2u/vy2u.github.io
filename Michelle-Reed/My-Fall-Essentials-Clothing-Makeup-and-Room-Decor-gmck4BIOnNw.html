good pair of boots and ironically i
actually have to of course
hi friends today I'm going to doing a
full essentials videos so basically all
of my favorite things about fall beauty
and fashion wise first I just want to
say that I did something different with
my hair and I can't really tell if I
like it or I hate it so if i do resemble
a lion and I look ridiculous and we're
just gonna look past that little facts
also I tried to film in front of my bed
and be all cute but then I realized that
my bed looks like this so we are back to
our usual spot today you know sitting a
thumbs up if you absolutely love fall as
much as I do because it's probably the
best season in the world let's just a
minute right now and let's just go ahead
and get into it my clothes are usually
very feminine and very delicate and
pretty like lace and little colors and
all that kind of stuff but sometimes I
just want to be a little bit edgy if you
know any but I don't just want to throw
on a leather jacket and be like whoa
this is not me at all so I've really
been loving these kind of shirts with
leather accents so they're not like too
much leather but there's enough leather
to get the point across I love this
shirt it's from j.crew it's just like a
normal t-shirt and it has black leather
sleeves on it and it's so simple into
you but if you add a necklace and maybe
like some skinny jeans and some flats
it's like the perfect cute semi AG
outfit and these have been everywhere so
I definitely love these kind of shirts
my second essential is just a staple
oversized sweater like this one it's
from brandy melville it's just a huge
like it covers the whole camera frame
huge and it's so comfy and warm and I
absolutely love this you know I can
dress it up with a scarf or you just
wear this with like some leggings or
something and be casual it's just the
perfect essential for a typical folding
another essential I have is kind of more
fitted sweaters whenever I just want
something that's kind of close to my
body if you know what I mean and this
one's from j.crew it has a super cute
white color
it something that's so well a sweater if
you know what I mean with like these
collars I just think it's really really
cute with simple yet cute and it's great
for fall and it's perfect the next
essential what I have is kind of that
military SJ kit with that kind of army
green color the first one is my more
kind of nicer jacket and it's actually
from choice which I will link down below
and it has this navy blue front and I
can't figure out what this material is
kind of like a suede and then it has the
Army Green sleeves what I love about
this jacket is it cinches in the waist
because a lot of times whenever I wear a
jacket I just feel like I'm swarmed and
you can't even see my body oh this it
kind of just situates your waist and it
gives that kind of thinner look if you
know what I mean now the bad guy has a
little belt so I think this is very cute
it's my ultimate favorite jacket so cozy
and it is absolutely perfect I also have
this one from H&amp;amp;M it's more of the
typical military jacket and it's kind of
more oversized and grungy and it's still
cinches in the waist like that choice
one this one's just a little more casual
where I can just throw it on some combat
boots and you're ready and you're set
for a perfect folding and I really have
a specific style scarf that I like but
this is my favorite one it's this
beautiful kind of plum color and it has
little shreds all over those cars I
think it's a good opportunity to throw
some color into your outfit something
like in maroon or a plum or kind of
maybe like an olive green just so you're
not always just wearing neutrals because
you know sometimes it's boring in colors
like this cheer me up throughout the day
I usually like to have one solid good
pair of boots because in the summertime
you can have dozens of sandals and they
break and you can go find cheap ones but
with full I think it's good just have
one solid good pair of boots and
ironically i actually have to of course
first pair is a short boot and these are
actually from choice and they are just a
brown pair and they're kind of almost
weather down they have that kind of
grungy look and then the doctors looks
like this so they're very simple yet I
love these they weren't too extensive I
think they were around maybe 60 or 70
which is a little pricey but you know
foods can get pretty pretty pricey the
next pair about to show you is a little
pricey it's from arturo chong if i'm
saying that right but i love these boots
they're just tall kind of writing style
boots and the leather is so nice on them
and they have these two little button
designs on also the cap on these is a
little wider because a lot of times
riding boots are very tight along the
cap and I just don't like that look on
me because I don't have the smallest
caps in the world and so something like
this with a wider calf just looks better
on me personally I always use this
palette from coastal scents and it's
just the warm palette I don't even know
if they're still selling this because i
bought this so long ago this has a ton
of warm color eye shadows like purple
and brown and tokes and just all those
lovely colors and i actually use it
today for this look i absolutely love
just using a ton of Browns in the fall
time on my eyeshadow I then have to lip
products for the fall time the first one
is a neutral and it is this lipstick and
pinky nude I use this in my last video
it's just a really pretty kind of nudie
pink obviously color but it's matt and i
love love matte colors for the call time
because i think they just look a lot
cleaner and nicer i also have this super
stay gloss and the color very heavenly
and it's a very pretty very lip stain
which is also not because i think having
a good staple berry lip color it's great
for the whole time the last thing that i
have to show you
is a candle because would this even be a
fall video if I didn't show you about
the bodywork scandal it is the flannel
candle and no I don't know what flannel
shirts not like but at least well like
this and I definitely just bought this
because it smells like boys let's be
honest which I know mahogany teak wood
is another candle that smells like boys
but this is just a little less so if you
think that one's a little too intense
definitely purchase this one there's
might as well as I'm just like oh my
gosh it's all time in a little bit and I
like that it's not the last thing I have
to show you guys this is kind of like a
home decor kind of thing but I love that
these floating candles I don't know if
you can see it but I basically just puts
one in some water in a mason jar with
some like liked wine on it and I think
it's so cute and it's so just pretty for
the whole time and so cozy and i love it
and i believe if you can get those at
michaels or hobby lobby or any other
cross so that is actually all of my
phone essentials that i have to show you
guys i really hope you guys are excited
for fall as much as I am I'm sorry I
have really done a lot of halloween
videos I just haven't really been that
big on Halloween this year and it's kind
of showing for my videos but if you have
any other recommendations please let me
know hope you guys enjoyed this and i'll
see you guys in my next video ah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
