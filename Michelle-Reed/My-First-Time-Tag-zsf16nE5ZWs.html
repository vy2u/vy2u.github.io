because like always you guys requests
more videos with him so he came over at
9 o'clock in the morning to fill this
with me because I had no other type - so
he's great you guys are great and today
we're gonna be doing the first time tag
it sounds a little sexual but it's
really just like your first time doing
certain things in your life and I
thought it'd be fun to bring gunner into
it so yes this tag kind of went around a
long time ago but it's going through my
youtube feed and I never really did this
so I decided that we should so like this
video if you want more videos with
gunner because I'm a gunner you guys
like I like let's be good alrighty the
first one is the first person that you
texted today first person I texted today
was you my first text was not Michelle
it was my friend AJ she sent me a
picture of his zigzags for second one is
your first fear and it was probably
something like being afraid of the dark
but the first one I can remember has
always been elevators like to this day I
hate elevators cuz ain't claustrophobic
and I'm scared that they're gonna get
stuck and even when I was little like I
always take the stairs because I think
about leaders my first fear would have
to be probably walks he's more scared
wasps first time at the hospital - you
saw me you summer things I got my puddin
he has a titanium bar but it says so
people call me iron
when it's really titanium yes I don't
know why I went to the hospital for this
but I broke my leg on a trampoline when
I was in like first no in like
kindergarten and I don't know why I went
to the hospital instead of like cooks
children's like next question is your
first big purchase and fine the biggest
thing I've ever bought like the most
money was my laptop that's like my
proudest accomplishment because I saved
up for that literally like years um mine
would have to be that's the biggest like
purchase I've ever had like money-wise
but I mean over time do it to be my
truck now at one time like spending
money it was the next one is your first
cell phone I had I did my first phone I
got in sixth grade and it was like this
eco friendly phone and it was blue and I
remember like the label said it was made
out of corn and so I bought it for that
reason
but it was like this blue one I pushed
up my first phone was a blue xenon LG
from LG it was one of the slide up with
there was one up on the side so it had
like that side keyboard though I was
jealous of those like sixth grade knows
the bottom so the next question is your
first youtube video and gunner doesn't
really have one so my first official one
it was a music video to this song by
Ke$ha I believe and I will replay some
of there right now
maybe
you got a crush
throws war bad times and you can't see
it because it's private and since it was
copyrighted but I kinda want to do like
though reacting to my old videos thing I
think that'd be fun so like this video
if you'd like to see that because the
next one is your first car they I
haven't I mean I like shared cars with
my family but I've never had a car that
I pay the payments on which I would
consider like your first car being so my
first car was a 1995 Chevy pickup this
cute car it was like when I was like old
cars it's cute it doesn't really work
they weren't fun are you kidding it
worked
nice question is what was your first
concert never been to one so we need to
fix that we're gonna do it cause they
don't really like the same music though
so my first concert was Cheetah Girls in
third grade you know it's honestly like
my only real concert I've been to like
festival like concert things but not
really Cheetah Girls
no reach query square so the end of this
video I hope you guys enjoyed it and I
tag all of you guys to do this and tell
me some of your first times in the
comments down below yeah they like to
needed out there last night yeah I'll
see you guys in our next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
