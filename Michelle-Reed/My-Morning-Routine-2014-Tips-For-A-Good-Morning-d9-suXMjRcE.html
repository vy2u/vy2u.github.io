you guys my tips about how to have a
good morning and also share my school
morning routine so I really hope you
guys enjoy so my first tip would be to
use some kind of sleep spray I bought
this from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and it's
like a lavender vanilla and I spray it
on my pillows before I go to bed and it
really calms me down and it smells great
secondly I've been loving this app which
is called sleep cycle and basically it
awakes you whenever you're in your
lightest sleep so you're not groggy and
tired and you're all awake and ready to
take on what the day has to offer then I
always make my bed in the morning
because I don't like to come home to a
messy bed and then I head over to my
bathroom where I like to splash some
very cold water on my face because it
wakes me up and then you've always got
to brush those teeth so I do that next
next I head over back into my room and I
like to play some good music to kind of
put me up I definitely love Pandora cuz
it introduces me to new music and I've
definitely been loving the Arctic
Monkeys station and the MGMT stations
now on to the makeup so once if I would
have is to use lighter face makeup so
it's easier to blend and it doesn't look
cakey and kind of weigh you down if you
know what I mean then I also use
multi-use products because they're easy
and you can use them in two places so
it's just a lot faster then I carry on
with the rest of my makeup routine which
you guys have seen plenty of times
her hair I just use this brush from
goodie that makes it very very soft and
it detangles it and yes my hair is
naturally this straight it's just very
very straight so I don't really have to
do anything to it which is kind of a
blessing my next tip would be to pick
out your outfit to the night before so
that doesn't take a whole lot of time to
do in the morning because we know that
takes a while then I would also say to
layer your clothes in case it's cold
inside your school building and my
sweaters from forever21
my denim shirt is from Buffalo exchange
my necklace is from Ward market and my
boots are from DSW then I head over to
the kitchen where I like to make coffee
at night and then put it in the fridge
and so in the morning I can have iced
coffee and just poured over ice
because iced coffee is so much more
refreshing than hot coffee for me then
typically I only have time to eat a
breakfast bar which probably is the best
tip but let's be honest that's what I
eat
and that is the end of my school earning
routine I really hope I gave you guys
some more tips to have a better morning
because mornings are honestly a great
time so I hope you guys enjoy and I'll
see you guys my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
