another kind of advice video but this
one is ugly gonna be different than my
other ones it's gonna be something
that's more important to me and
something that I find a lot of value
when I guess I know I've done a lot of
advice the past just on like school and
YouTube and that kind of stuff and all
that stuff is important I just wanted to
do something that was more close to my
heart and something that I just feel
really compelled to probably wondering
what is this important advice that you
have and this video is just going to be
about finding yourself and finding what
you enjoy doing and doing what you love
when I was thinking about video ideas I
was looking at my demographics and I was
looking at the 8 and I saw that most of
my viewers were from the age of 13 to 17
so in the teenage years the prime time
of our lives and I felt like this really
connected to teenagers like myself
growing up especially as a teenager
there's so many things that are accepted
and doing stuff that's socially
acceptable just because you want to fit
in you want to do things that please
other people you want to have friends
you want to be this learner who's
different and does different things
because why would you would do that
being so young and have been so creative
and having all these ideas teenagers who
are so beyond smart and creative are
limited to something socially acceptable
it's so crazy because I know there's
people out there who have these crazy
amazing thoughts that can truly change
what goes on but they're just confined
to what's socially acceptable because
they want to fit in and I guess that
right there is why I hate high school
with a passion doing stuff that it's
different in doing stuff that makes an
impact on other people is not acceptable
and it just it kills me because there's
so many amazingly talented people out
there who are confined to what is
acceptable in their high school I use in
middle school I was kind of used to this
kind of thing I did what got me friends
and what got me a social life because
that is what I was used to and it wasn't
until I found YouTube when I began to
see what I was made of I remember
starting out
to channel and I don't really put much
thought into it I decide all this is
just something on the Internet I'm just
gonna go ahead to try it looks fun I see
other people doing it and so I did it
and looking back three years or four
years from now coming up on four years
how crazy awesome and blessed I am to
have it and about two years into YouTube
I really realized how important doing
what I loved was I figured out about
YouTube and I really started prospering
and figuring out how it all worked
that's when I begin to see this as a
career and I know at fifteen and having
aspirations and dreams is crazy and it's
stupid to most people but because I want
to do film in college and I'm gonna
prosper and I want to just make
something out of this the state and what
was normal and what was accepted this
would have never came about YouTube has
taught me so much and so much just about
how important doing what you love and
what you've been gifted in is and it's
amazing and I absolutely love it and I
thank God every day for how blessed I am
to have it and while I may be on kind of
a rough patch right now with you - with
just school and not having the time to
create good quality videos it still has
such a big part of my heart and I love
it the llama being said I just wanted to
say how important doing what you love is
because I know a while in high school
it's just like oh you do this you get
through this you get through this oh and
you have a social life and you're
accepted and yay and while in high
school that seems like that's the goal
it's so important to be bigger than that
and I was like people sing you a song by
John Mayer it's called bigger than my
body and it's just that he says like
you're bigger than your body gives you
credit for it and I believe that so much
because you'll have it so much potential
to do some if they just get out of
what's socially acceptable and what is
it do what they love so if there is
something that you absolutely love doing
but you don't feel comfortable doing it
because you don't think people accept
you but you love it and you feel happy
doing it and it brings you happiness
definitely do it because that is what
YouTube is for me and it's just this
amazing thing where I get to stay here
and talk to the camera and share my
feelings
so what I can do with the camera in it
has led to the most amazing thing in my
life so just all that being said I just
wanted to say to do what you love
because in the end I know we're all
going to grow up and some of us are
gonna have to do jobs that we don't like
because we didn't figure out what we
wanted we didn't figure out how to make
that a job and I would say now all my 13
and 17 year old an 18 year old a 19 year
old a four year olds watching of how
important it is to just find what you
love and make that a career possibly
something brings you happiness and it
brings you joy then do I stop it well I
stopped it because in the end that's all
that's before it doesn't matter what
so-and-so thinks about you or so and so
says about you if it's what you love do
it into the day when everything is
terrible in crap and I just have the
worst thing ever
YouTube it brings me happiness and I
love it I will make you happy and find
what you love it do it because it makes
all the difference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
