hardcore judge guys I'm here with
another video and this is going to be 15
pet peeves of mine so recently a lot of
things have just been annoying me and I
feel like I need to confess these things
to somebody and I love you guys the most
so you get to hear me rant for about 5
minutes if you're going to be offended
by this or anything please just X on
this video dislike it unsubscribe do
what you want to so fifteen thanks do
you confess to you guys I'm just going
to go ahead and get started basically
they just said indirect tweets to people
that they are bad at or do not like
something that they did and it's so
annoying if you have a Twitter and all
you have the court system tweet you need
to face your confrontation problems
obviously everybody knows who you're
talking about that person knows you're
talking about them so why don't you just
go up and have a conversation and
confess your problems because that's
just a better resolution when you
literally work so hard on a video and
you get it like 20 comments saying you
copy ba ba ba ba you call me bubble it's
so annoying it's like I shouldn't copy
them I didn't know I mean obviously if
two youtubers do the same kind of video
it's going to be different because you
just accept that instead of going on
that you copy blah blah and if you
worked hard on the video nobody wants to
get that you just talking something
because it's not cool
now I'm not talking about like
subscribers or anything of that matter
because I love obsessive subscribers
because all are amazing I'm talking
about like obsessive fans of One
Direction or Justin Bieber I cannot
stand it it's so annoying they go to
great lengths to figure out anything
about that person or turning that thing
off like oh my gosh I love you I love
you you do not love them you don't love
them you love who they portrayed
themselves to be it's different it's not
you don't love them I don't need to hear
your food and I don't need to see it so
put it away Chu it's easy
put your lips together it's not a big
deal and don't see why people can't
grasp the concept nobody wants to see
your chewed up food in your mouth I'm
sorry I know that's hard to leave but no
put it away you are aware of this movie
called pitch perfect you know there's
this little song with cups and you know
it's cute it was cute for about a week
and then everybody started learning it
and posting videos of it and now it's on
the radio 24/7 that's a target the other
day and I saw that they sold a
pitch-perfect
cup along with the movie you have a
pitch-perfect cup I am a hardcore
judging you people who take the same
selfie in the same decision now I know
you've all seen this on Instagram it's
the same girl who's just like selfie
Sunday same position every single Sunday
I know it's Sunday if you look the same
in every single picture I don't know why
you see the points I'm posting five in
the same pictures it's not necessary
please change up your selfie position
and we will all be happy like you're
just having fun with a bunch of people
and you're just all like singing like
you know and you're all just singing you
kind of been your bad Boise area I'm
talking about
and like there's one person just thinks
they should be on American Idol and
they're singing in their real voice and
they know they think they're really good
it's so annoying save that for your
YouTube
or the shower or something but don't do
it around other people now I don't know
about you guys but my like normal face
my normal face when I'm just being
serious it looks like I want to kill
somebody and I hate that about myself
because everybody's like oh my gosh why
are you mad why you're angry I'm not
angry that's just my face and I hate
that because people think I don't like
them but it's just it's how my face is
and I'm sorry I'm not angry I'm not
angry it's just my face I don't care if
it's don't work one day or
twork every day Tuesday nobody needs to
see you Turkey it's so trashy if you
post pictures of you twerking I'm
praying for you
so basically you got the movies and it's
an empty theater there's no seats taken
if somebody decides to sit right next to
you and it's the worst there's like 50
other seats in this place I'm sure you
can find somewhere that's much better
than right next to me I can't I can't if
you don't know what this is it's
basically they're just texting somebody
and you see something and they just
reply with Kay just straight-up Kay not
okay all right that's cool and okay
there are better words to explain that
you're angry than just came I can
reassure you that
especially in the mall I don't know
about you guys but you're just you know
casually walking anymore constantly
stepping on your heels it's so annoying
I cannot stand it you can walk a little
slower maybe cut around me and pass if
you do not have to stand right behind me
and walk right behind me and set on my
feet it's not necessary I probably need
a judge this is really stupid but
whatever you are that whatever you like
vacuum your room or you're looking over
something and those lines are left in
the carpet this bothers me so badly
every semester I thought you might have
to like go around my room and cover up
all the lines because I cannot stand
them not an OCD person so I don't really
understand why this bothers me but I
can't stand these vacuum lines at all
how crowded they are how people enjoy
stopping in the middle of highway 20 air
france when you have to get somewhere is
like i don't know about you but i got to
get to class or why don't you move i
just bother to be so bad take it to the
side are a little bitter go to the
bathroom i don't know where you like to
have your posse but some people actually
go to school for school so you should
get out of the hallway i can say that i
don't work out i don't when people will
request like workout routines i kind of
just laugh because i don't and your
people here you feel the need after they
quote work out okay you don't lift a
couple are these even called this is how
you
you don't workout with weights after
they left a couple weights they just
feel the need you know post a picture
and they're perfect workout gear like
just got done with they didn't work out
and just loose it on Twitter or
Instagram it bothers me so much you
believe you you don't need to have a
picture to say it just just workout
because you love to not because you're
trying to impress your followers it's
not the end of this video and I hope you
guys weren't too offended in make sure
to LIKE this video if you agree with any
of my pet peeves that I have um please
don't get too offended for now uh yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this and I'll see
you guys my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
