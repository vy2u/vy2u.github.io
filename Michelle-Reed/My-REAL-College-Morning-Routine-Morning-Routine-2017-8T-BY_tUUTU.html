college morning routine video but I'm
trying to make this as realistic as
possible so I'm literally coming to you
guys like right after I woke up to film
this I also want to thank acne-free for
sponsoring this video and I'm really
excited to be working with them on this
video I really hope you guys enjoy this
let me know down below if you guys are
in college which college you go to which
grade you're in because they'd
definitely be interested and know and
also this is kind of my routine when I
wake up at like 7:00 in the morning per
class so it's like super real super
candid and let's just go ahead and get
right into it so I start my morning off
at around 7 a.m. I usually wake up at 7
for my 9 a.m. classes and I know going
on your phone is really bad in the
morning but I'm just gonna be honest I
always check my emails and my Instagram
right when I wake up literally only for
like 5 minutes but I'm just being honest
I do do it besides making up to natural
light though that's why I love my window
and then I always make my bed because
coming home to a made bed just like
makes me feel more productive and so I
literally do this every day so in the
morning skincare is super important to
me because last year at college you guys
know my skin like got really really bad
now this year I've been really good
about actually keeping up my skincare
routine in the morning as well as
tonight and so I've been using the acne
free products lately this is the acne
free 24-hour acne clearing this system I
really like these because they're really
easy to use there's only three steps so
it's really easy to do in the morning
for college they're also really cheap so
they're good because I don't like to
like buy really expensive skincare
products all the time so I love the acne
free system because there are only three
steps and you start seeing results in
one to three days which is awesome and
all three steps actually come in the 24
hour kit so I always start off with the
oil-free purifying cleanser which
removes any dirt and excess of oil that
I have on my face I always find when I
wake up in the morning my skin is pretty
oily so I really like this one the acne
free system actually uses micronized
benzoyl peroxide to treat acne blemishes
and it helps prevent new ones from
forming which is great it's basically a
smaller form of benzoyl peroxide so it
allows it to penetrate into your pores
and help treat acne I then use step
number two which is the renewing toner
just to reduce shine and then I finish
off with a repair lotion which contains
benzoyl peroxide which helps prevent
acne
I really like the skincare routine just
because it always leaves me feeling
confident since I don't wear a lot of
makeup in college they're also available
on Amazon so I'll have the link down
below to check them out they're super
affordable which is great for college
it's definitely my current and go to
morning and nighttime routine skincare
and if you want to make it part of your
skincare routine and make sure to use
the amazon promo code down below to get
20% off the acne free kits so for makeup
i don't actually wear too much makeup to
class just because when it's early in
the morning I usually don't like to
spend a ton of time to do makeup also
when the lighting is better out here I
prefer to do it on my desk just cuz the
natural lighting looks a lot better so I
start off with sunscreen just because my
acne products do contain benzoyl
peroxide so you always want to make sure
you use sunscreen and then I just
conceal underneath my eyes with a little
bit of concealer and I just set it with
a translucent powder so I completely
skip foundation I like to put a lot of
bronzer all over my face just to kind of
make my paleness a little bit too more
tan and then I also just like to go
ahead and sculpt my cheekbones with my
bronzer and I also like to go in with
some blush and some highlighter and then
I also just fill in my brows a little
bit because I recently got them done and
then I just threw on a little bit of a
tan eye shadow highlighted underneath my
brows applied an eyeliner curl my lashes
applied some mascara and then I always
like to apply it a little bit of
lipstick just so it looks like I try it
a little more and then I just took out
my hair and that was it for getting
ready in the morning
so after do my makeup I usually like to
head over and pick out my outfit and now
at my school we actually have a dress
code so we have to wear like business
casual so actually like put effort into
what I wear so this is usually like the
trickiest part of the morning picking
out outfits in the morning always takes
me a little bit of time since I actually
have to like look nice but today I just
decided to throw on this Madewell
sweater dress because it was a little
bit cooler outside just with some tights
and boots so no matter how busy I am
throughout the day I never skip
breakfast I always make breakfast here
in my apartment is so important if I
don't have it I'm screwed up for the
rest of the day I usually either have
overnight oats oatmeal or I have a
smoothie recently I've been making this
green smoothie that is so good I'm the
kind of person that doesn't get filled
up by smoothies too much and so this one
actually fills me up and it's so tasty
so I'm going to show you guys
how
make it rocks it's awesome I'm just
using some frozen pineapples some frozen
mangos and banana chia seeds this humm
green smoothie powder a ton of spinach
almond milk and just a little tiny bit
of honey and then I just blend that up
sometimes I'll add in some coconut too
and it is so delicious so I usually have
time to watch one YouTube video before I
go to class so I'll just sip this and
watch a video and I usually just keep it
in the container cuz that's one less
thing to wash so today this morning I
just decided to sit on my bed and sip my
smoothie and I was watching Remy's vlogs
I really like watching really long vlogs
throughout the day and kind of just like
picking up and coming back to them and
then around 8 o'clock I will head out
the door and commute to class and I
really liked it today it's been really
really warm outside lately but today it
was like 50 degrees and it felt like
fall and I was wearing my scarf so I was
really feeling it
but basically I'll just commute to
school and I like to get there a little
bit early to just work on some homework
before my 9 a.m. class I print something
off whatever I have to do and that is it
for my morning routine that is the end
of my morning routine I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you liked the
more blog style mixed with like the
normal style let me know down below cuz
they did try to do something a little
bit different to switch things out again
let me know what school you go to down
below I would love to hear acne free
links will be down below as well so you
should definitely check them out I love
the product so much I love you guys so
much have a great day my friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
