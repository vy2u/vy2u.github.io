because it is going to be my study
routine video you guys have asked me so
many times show how do you get really
good grades in college Michelle how do
you study and today I decided to compile
10 or like 11 on my favorite tip about
how to study that actually helped
studying I feel like is one of those
things that once you actually get down
what works for you you can really be
successful as I wanted to say sorry for
not posting for like two weeks as we
have it I've actually been having final
I have been vlogging every single day on
my second channel and it has been so
much fun I have connected so much with
you guys I just feel super close with
you guys so definitely go follow my blog
channel I know I was off of it for a
while but I've uploaded like 10 blogs
for who I miss so you should definitely
check that out also let me know what
college you go to if you're watching
this video because I'd love to know you
know where you're go also if you're
wondering where my dress is from I think
I might get questions actually going to
off up the DOE app which dough is not
sponsoring this video but I wanted to
let you guys know you want to follow it
it's basically like an online shopping
app you should definitely follow me my
account is michelle rhee use the code
Michelle you get five dollars off also
my losses in this video are real they're
from glasses USA so let's just go ahead
and get right into the video
between you pack your bag completely I
hate when I will like commute 45 minutes
to get to this really cute coffee shop
and realize that I left in don't book at
home double check that you have all the
notebooks that you need double check
that you have your laptop your charger
whatever it may be because forgetting
those things is really annoying
I feel like different people prefer to
dress differently for study I know a lot
of people really prefer comfy clothes
like leggings and a sweatshirt and if
that's you than that is you girl like
you do that but for me I like to kind of
wear something that's not like nice but
like jeans and a nice shirt because I
feel like whenever I look like put
together I feel put together so figure
out a number that you feel like you can
focus and I know it sounds really simple
but it actually makes a really really
big some people may work really well in
their own dorm room or their own like
home space office whatever maybe but I
like to go to a coffee shop or like a
library there are tons of coffee shops
in New York City and so there's always
something to go to here so I prefer that
just because it gets me out of my zone
and I feel like I can focus whenever I'm
like outside somewhere whereas again if
I stay in here I'll like crawl back in
the bed
I honestly turn my phone on airplane
mode you can turn it off I have someone
who's definitely gonna like start
scrolling through Instagram start
replying to emails start at like seeing
what you guys comment on my new floor
even if you can leave your phone at home
I've actually done that before where I'm
like I know I'm not to be able to focus
I'll just like leave it entirely
I also like to write out the tasks that
I have from hardest the easiest and I
will do them in that order because for
me it's always like the hard essays and
stuff that are just like looming on my
chest and I feel like I can't really
start focusing unless I get those things
done people really like doing the
easiest things first and that's totally
cool too because you feel like once you
get that done you can really focus on
the hard thing
I like to do tangible assignments first
and what I mean by that is if I have
like an essay to write or if I have a
math worksheet to do if I have online
accounting homework I will do those
things first so if they're just like one
and go assignments that you just get
done they're not like oh I have this
final that I have to study for I will do
those first is once I get those out of
the way I can really just hardcore set
in a few hours to study for a test and
I'll be like oh my gosh I've got
accounting homework or that worksheet or
this essay
which is an app where you can create
your own flashcards I know some people
don't like studying online that's
totally cool I used to be like that but
now in college I feel like there's so
much information that I can't make
actual flashcards for everything which
if you'd know me guys I love flashcards
and that was like a really hard for
y'all I need to grab quiz that is great
it's free you can create sets and they
have like a test option and they have a
flashcard option so they have so many
different options there's just a lot of
different ways study people have
probably already created sets for the
subject that you're studying so you can
use other people
you're writing an essay I would
recommend this is kind of like common
knowledge but outlining your stuff first
and getting off your evidence points so
if you're writing an essay where you
have to have references lay out your
paragraphs and be like I'm gonna use
this reference in this reference and
really organize because then when you go
to write the essay it's so much easier
especially if it's a long one it just
makes the process go by so much quicker
and it really saves you in that I know
some people can't study with music but I
kind of have to just because it's always
loud here and if I don't have music that
I can't focus because I love chill off
it's a John raw that's like chill
hip-hop I think awed by has so many
playlists with them I just love them so
many of you guys ask me where I get my
music and it's usually chill-out music
because it's just like easy to focus I
would like to like study for an hour and
then I will go like to a study break
whether that be like grabbing coffee
grabbing water watching a YouTube video
checking out my account on the DOE app
and making some sweet new that's that
you should follow me on breaks actually
do help because if you sit somewhere for
a really long time like it's gonna get
burnt out and once you get burnt out
makes it a lot harder to study so those
are my best tips that I definitely use
everytime I study if they helped you
give us video a thumbs up again let me
know where you go to school down below I
love you guys and I'll see you guys in
my next video bye friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
