show boy
hi guys me doing a scarf collection
video I get requested this all the time
especially on Instagram I don't know
there's like one person who's like scarf
collection scarf collection so I decided
to do that so I have all the scarves
right here I also want to note that me
my sister's kind of all share a scarf so
these are just the ones that are in my
room right now I probably have more but
some are in like a sister's room some of
these are probably my sister's as well
the first one I have looks like this it
is from Urban Outfitters it's just a
loop scarf it's more like a wintry one
it's really big and chunky and yeah it
looks like this have another loop scarf
and it's just purple and it has like
silver threading in it my friend McCall
actually gave this to me for Christmas
so I have no idea where this is from but
it looks like this I have another loop
scarf this one is more colorful and
springy and I really like this one has
like purple green blue and yellow
flowers in it this scarf is from
American Eagle so I have a pink hoop
scarf this one's actually my sister I
think but it looks like this is just
pink and white just a loop scarf and
yeah this one is from Urban Outfitters
the next scarf I have looks like this
it's just kind of a purpley colored one
and it's kind of shredded almost or the
look of it this one's from Urban
Outfitters as well and it's really
pretty I really like this one for the
winter times it's nice and big and
chunky looks like this and yeah this
next one is kind of just this bluish
grey color and it has I don't even know
looks like that I don't know what those
are just like little grain dot thing
that's what it looks like that is known
as one of those kind of like cowboy
handkerchiefs style ones and I also have
no idea where this one is from because
it's my sister's but I'm just gonna
guess perfect Outfitters because that's
where the majority of these are from so
this scarf looks like this it's just a
green and gold and it has little like I
don't know flowery things on I don't
even know what's on this my sister
actually gave this to me for my birthday
and it's from world market so this one
is my sister so I have no idea where
it's from it's like blue and white and
the tribal I'm guessing it's from
earthbound but I'm not exactly for sure
I'm just gonna guess that so this scarf
is Jamie's but I wear it a lot I decided
to show what it's like yellow and it has
all these cool colorful patterns inside
it's really awesome and kind tribally so
it has like purple pink blue
all these fun colors in it and I like to
make this one a loop scarf even though
it's a rectangle scarf so the scarf is
from Urban Outfitters and on one side
it's kind of leopard ee it's like orange
and blue and then the opposite side is
more floral I really like this scar I
feel like it's really interesting and
different and our a lot of people have
something like this it's just like a
rectangle scarf so it's just all one a
long strand really hurt the soft one is
my new one it's my favorite right now I
got it off Etsy and it just has little
anchors all over it it's so cute kind of
like this off-white cream color in navy
blue and I feel like it's so cute for
springtime it's nice spring you with a
whole anchor thing which if you don't
know on my banner there's an anchor on
it and it's like hoping curves of Seoul
which is one of my favorite verses and
so I kind of feel like this is my little
youtube scarf has anchors on it
something like that I'm pretty sure
those are my scarves and if you have a
scarf collection up or some outfit of
the day you're wearing a scarf I don't
even know leave a video response and of
course if you have any questions or
recommendations and leave them in the
comments and I also want to say I'm
sorry that I filmed in like sitting down
in the same location two days in a row I
don't really like to do that but I'm
working on a couple of videos that are
really cool and different or not cool
and different but they're out of my room
they're in nature so just wait and be
patient for that and I will have some
cooler videos up soon I promise I'll see
you guys my next video ah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
