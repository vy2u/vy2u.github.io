summer fitness routine because I've seen
a lot recently that the whole bikini
body thing is really becoming a trend so
I decided to help you guys achieve the
body that you desire so I don't really
want to have a long intro so I'm just
going to go ahead and get into this
video
tip number one
take as many workout selfies as possible
now if you take a few selfies I mean
that's good but the more you take the
more arm effort it's going to take so
honestly just take as many as you want
and don't be afraid to try any new
positions
tip number two place a chip bag as far
away as possible so you must do crunches
to reach it so just set the bag down get
down on the ground and do your crunches
and grab a chip to reward yourself every
time you make it up tip number three
when your package arrives in the mail
jog to go get it
that part is I'm actually sweating right
now tip number four before you sit to do
your makeup do some sports
tip number five when getting a soda pull
the fridge door a few extra times this
way you're getting an increased amount
of arm effort to get that soda that you
really really want it number six when
doing push-ups reward yourself with a
piece of clothing I love online shopping
so this has to be one of my favorites
just do a push-up and then add something
to your cart tip number seven
strategically hide your lock top so you
must work to watch Netflix this way you
really have to look around before
watching your favorite show
tip number eight attempt complicated
hairstyles every time I try a
complicated hairstyle my arms always get
really really sore so that's great
you're really working on those biceps in
those triceps expectation reality
so that's the end of this fitness
routine I really hope I got a laugh or
two out of you guys make sure they go
follow my instagram and twitter they'll
be down below and just have a great
summer I'll see you guys my next video
