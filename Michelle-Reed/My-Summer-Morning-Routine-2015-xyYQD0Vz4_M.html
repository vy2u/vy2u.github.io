your phone all day won't you come back
down the earth you spend too much time
in cyberspace okay okay okay
hi guys today I'm here to do a video
that I am super excited for you guys to
watch it's going to be a summer morning
routine I haven't done just like a
straight-up morning routine video and
what feels like forever so I'm stoked
for this video you probably tell I'm
just like jumping around with joy I know
a lot of people watch these videos just
for fun so if you aren't subscribed you
definitely should my name's Michelle I
upload every Sunday in Thursdays and I
love making YouTube videos so it's very
nice to meet you
we are gonna try to get a light gold
because believe it or not I have never
done a like a goal so definitely like
this video and let's see if it is to
4000 likes that would be just incredible
guys
I believe that's everything I have to
say for the intro to this video so we're
just gonna go ahead and get into my
summer morning routine so typically at
night I fall asleep watching the office
and so I always wake up to Michael
Scott's face and I get really freaked
out
seriously this happens way too often
also I was too lazy to put pillowcases
on my pillow so just kind of ignore that
but then I get out of bed and how super
cute are these umbrella sleep shorts I
am loving them lately
and then I make my bed if only it was
that easy and then I head over to the
bathroom to wash my face and brush my
teeth I then just rinse my face off with
some water and brush my teeth and I've
actually been using this white with
style whitening kit to wipe my teeth
since I have time in the mornings you
have this kit is all-natural it's not
very sensitive it's like and make your
teeth hurt and it's vegan and gluten
free so it's really natural all you do
is make the molds and then you put the
gel in and kind of let it sit for about
30 minutes and then and yeah that's
pretty much it for the teeth whitening
I'll have a link down below and also a
really great coupon code that you should
definitely check out
then I just take out the molds after 30
minutes and I will rinse my teeth out
and you'll have these nice pearly whites
I do this about twice a week then I go
and make myself some coffee which I know
kind of contradicts the whitening part
but I gotta have me some coffee guides
then I had some sweet and low and some
creamer and I will just drink a little
bit of coffee before I eat my breakfast
which was actually an egg in a hole and
some oranges and grapes and yeah this
was a really good breakfast a lot better
than I usually have which is usually
just cereal a lot of you guys have
requested that I leave what music I use
my videos so I actually created a
Spotify playlist that will be linked
down below if you're interested but I
usually just listen to this while I do
my makeup in the morning and I get down
if you know what I mean so I had to do
my makeup and I actually have a whole
video about my everyday summer makeup
routine so you can definitely check that
out it'll be linked up below and at the
end of these little clips
my typical summer hairstyle is just some
straight hair in this little fishtail
half-up half-down style that Aspen
showed in a recent video I've been
loving it it gets my hair on my face
it's just a little cuter than your
typical half-up half-down style so yeah
I really like doing this around
lunchtime I decided to go out with my
friend Rose and we got some lunch which
I know we kind of just say breakfast but
this was a little bit later guys and
also I'm wearing different clothes in a
different hairstyle because this was
filmed on a different day but we just
had some really yummy pita sandwiches
and fruit and it was such a little nice
lunch date and I love rose so it was a
good time and of course there was an
Ulta nearby so we just had to stop in
you guys should definitely let me know
what your favorite summer products are
because I'm always looking to buy some
new makeup products we also looked at
the Free People clothing because I love
looking at Free People stuff and
pretending I can purchase it and that is
everything for my summer morning routine
I really hope you guys like this video
and again you should subscribe if you
did and you'd like to see more videos
from me every Sunday and Thursday if you
happen to get bored a lot in the summer
you should definitely watch my last
video it was a things to do when you're
bored in the summer and I really tried
to make it kind of cool and different so
you should definitely check that video
out it'll be somewhere around here
and yeah I hope you guys have a great
day and you're enjoying your summer and
I'll see you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
