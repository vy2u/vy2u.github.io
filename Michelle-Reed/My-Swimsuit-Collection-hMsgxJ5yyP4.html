little fun video that I thought of and
this is going to be a swimsuit guide for
the 2014 summer swimsuit season I love
some suits but I know sometimes it can
be hard to pick them out and know where
to go and find cheap ones so today I
decided to gather up a bunch of
swimsuits that we have and show you guys
I'm also going to be helping different
people with different body types figure
out which one's would best con them and
so yeah I'm just gonna go ahead and get
started so I three favorite places to go
and get swimsuits
it's Victoria's Secret PacSun and Target
and they're all different price ranges
but they all have really good swimsuits
the first kind of swimsuits that I own
are Bandos and now these are what they
look like you probably all have seen
them they're just swimsuit bells like
this so they all have straps and they
just go around your body and they're
usually kind of smaller in the chest
area but this is one that I have from
PacSun it's really to hospitals now I
would recommend these for people who are
more small chested because they're gonna
stay on better for me these don't really
stay on my body very well so I don't
wear them anymore but those from PacSun
I think it was probably max like $25 or
nothing too expensive
souther wine is actually my sister's and
it looks like this it just has like red
orange and purple flowers all over it I
like this one because it ties in the
back so you can make it and whatever
tightness that you want because I know
with this one you have to clip it and
sometimes those ones don't really work
so I so I have this one from Victoria's
Secret now this one is a little bit more
expensive Victoria Secret swimsuit
usually arrived from like 35 to almost
$60 so yeah they are more expensive but
they're really great quality this is one
that I bought last year and it has a
little like confetti all over it and
it's so cute and bright and I love it I
have to wear these with the straps
because they don't stay on but some
people can keep them up and so I feel
like they're really cute as Bandos but
so the next two suits that I have our
boat like the halter top ones because
they both have straps on this first one
is from Target and I absolutely love
target substitutes good they look
exactly like the Victoria Secret ones
and they're really cheap and they're
just great quality and I love them so
this is one that I have I recently
bought this year and it's just a teal
color
cowboy bra but I think it's comes up it
clasps in the back and then it has a
just tie fits my body really really
nicely it doesn't have too much push up
in it because I feel like push up can be
a little bit too much for me sometimes
but uh I think that this stuff fits me
really nicely and it doesn't do too much
to my body
I think these swimsuits are for people
who like to feel secure and not like
something's gonna fall off like the
Bandos could and so if you're definitely
one of those people who just doesn't
really want something that may fall off
then I think these swimsuits are better
for you I also have another one from
Victoria's Secret and it looks like this
and I showed this in a recent video but
it has a bunch of different like Paisley
flower type designs all over it and then
it ties in the back which I love and it
ties at the top Victoria Secret tops are
definitely very padded so if you want
something with a lot of support I
definitely recommend them but I love
this swimsuit I think it's really bright
the insides like neon pink and now I
also have this one and this one's also
my sisters but I think it's really cute
it's just a very kind of like bouncy
little swimsuit I think you've all seen
these before but it's like a neon yellow
color and then underneath it's just gray
we're just kind of weird no no the thing
about it's kind of a weird color pattern
but thinking subsists are just fun and
cute
and something different that you don't
see a lot so I know that so these at
Target and pretty much everywhere now
because they're super popular but I
think these are kind of just fun cute
swimsuits to wear those are all the tops
that I have to show you guys I'm going
to move on to the bottoms I have three
pairs of torrid bottoms the first ones
are these kind of like magenta colored
ones and they have ties on decide so I'm
not a huge fan of but I do like these
they're comfortable and the color didn't
fade and I have them all last year so I
think these are pretty good I think that
like these two would go together pretty
nicely
just because kind of brings out the
magenta top and so these ones which
again have the ties on the side which I
don't like I feel like these ties can
kind of make your thighs look a little
bit bigger than they are and so if
you're worried about your thighs looking
big then I wouldn't recommend these but
I do think it's so cute but there's got
my favorite type of bottoms but this
one's more of like a coral color
I think these violets would go well with
this swimsuit the last target swimsuit
bottom that I had this is really cute
like ECOT powder Internet tribal one and
then the insides like a mate green it's
so cute I love this I like to wear this
with this swimsuit I think it goes
together really nicely
Plus where I have it from Victoria's
Secret and I absolutely love these kind
of bottoms there in the I don't know
this quality of a band on the side
they're definitely faded because they're
from last year but these are my all-time
favorite bottoms another little more
expensive then target but they do last a
good bit of time so I'll say I just like
to show you guys a swimsuit cover-up
that I bought my sugar I think it's from
Victoria's Secret and it's a super cute
crochet little tight dress
and I absolutely love this because it's
white so it does make you look tanner
and it's just cute to wear over swimsuit
with your swimsuit kind of peeking
outside a bright color oh it just looks
really cute definitely happy that I have
this now because I can't wait to wear it
this year so those are all of my
swimsuit pics I really hope you guys
