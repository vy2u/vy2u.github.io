that I'm really really excited about
because I've been wanting to do this
video for such a long time and it is my
workout routine over about the past six
months or so I'd say I've developed a
very consistent workout routine and if
you told me six months ago you know
Michele you're gonna have a workout
routine I would laughing it's something
that's very new to me but something that
I really really enjoy for the first half
of this video I'm just going to talk
about some things that in the second
half I'm actually going to show you guys
what the routine is whereas the first
part men talk more through did that make
sense if you're new to my channel and
you happen to just stumble upon this
video you should definitely subscribe I
upload once or twice a week and I do
beauty fashion and lifestyle videos and
I really love for you to be a part of it
channel so before I say anything I want
to state that I am NOT a personal
trainer I'm not a fitness expert I'm a
17 year old teenager and this is just
what works for me I feel like a lot of
people like to nitpick workout routines
and say that people are doing stuff
wrong and just call them out for stuff
and if that's going to be you you don't
have to watch this video this is just
for people who want to be healthier and
wants to develop a workout routine and
it's what works for me so basically I
work out about five days a week however
sometimes oh do more and sometimes I
will be blessed let's say I'm hanging
out with someone or I'm just hanging out
with my family and I don't really want
to go at night I will not go I don't
want working out to ever feel like a
chore and so for me I try to just do it
to have fun and be fun and be fit
because that's what works for me and so
I typically like to stay around five
days a week but give or take I mean I'm
not gonna beat myself up if I miss a day
I also want to say that I work out in a
gym I actually filmed this video outside
cuz obviously I wasn't gonna like go in
my gym and like workouts that'd be
really really weird feel more motivated
whenever there's people around me
working out I go to a really good gym
it's like a family style it's not
anything too pretentious or anything and
so I really enjoy that personally I
usually go in the evenings again I think
that's kind
weird a lot of people like to work out
in the morning I actually have Jarrell
team practice in the morning and so I
can't do that
and I just like working out at night I
feel like I'm more refreshed and
relieved and I have a lot of sleeping
problems and so it helps me sleep so I
typically work out from like six to
eight not six to eight but I will go
between those times I also want to say
that I don't work out to lose weight I
work out because it makes me feel good
because I like getting toned because I
just think it's fun for me I think the
most important part of working out is
developing a consistent routine if you
go once sporadically it's not going to
do anything I mean you'll get a nice
like feeling of high off getting working
out but it's not really gonna remain and
it's not gonna become a routine unless
you push yourself to do it I actually
recently read this book which is called
the power of habit and it talks about
developing good habits and what it takes
and what you can personally do to
develop a habit and this I feel like is
so true when it comes to working out
basically habits have a cue a routine
and a reward and the only way to develop
a habit is to change the routine so for
me working out I would get really
distracted from my homework and I would
want to go on my laptop or go on social
media or do something to prevent myself
from doing homework
however instead of going on the internet
I started to work out I would give
myself an hour just to refresh to run
and do a nice workout and so my reward
was that yes I still got to not do my
homework for a little bit like not that
break but I didn't do it by going on the
internet I did it by doing something
positive so if you ever want to develop
a habit of working out try figuring out
what a Q is what your routine is and
what the reward is and that's what
helped me personally and yeah that's
pretty much all I have to say for this
first half so we're just gonna go ahead
and get into the actual workout portion
and I really hope you guys enjoy this I
hope you guys feel motivated working out
it's awesome and yeah let's just go
ahead and get into it so I always like
to make sure that I have good music to
work out to so I actually created a
whole Spotify playlist for you guys my
Spotify is this is smiling shell and it
is also linked down below but you should
definitely check it out so to start my
workout I always run two to three miles
I really really enjoy running and I
think it's so good for your body for
burning calories and burning fat so
definitely recommend doing this if I
have good music I can push myself each
time I try to run about a fifth of a
mile longer each time I go just so I
keep pushing myself and I keep working
harder then I move on to my favorite ab
workout so I always start off with 30
just normal crunches of my legs bent at
90 degrees making sure to get my
shoulder blades off the ground and then
I will do 20 on each leg with each of my
legs lift it up that makes sense and
then I will do these kind of scissor cut
ones where basically you just move your
legs up and down make sure you keep the
small of your back push down in the
ground though I really didn't do that in
this clip I'm sorry after doing 20 of
those I will move on to side crunches
and I'll do about 20 on each side of my
body and then I do 15 just normal
sit-ups where I go all the way up making
sure to keep my hands and my feet on the
ground and then I do about 20 Russian
twists and sometimes I will do this with
about a 10-pound weight sometimes I will
do it without it whenever I'm feeling
that day and then I would do 10 leg up
ab exercises these hurt so bad but
they're so good for your lower abs and
then at the end I will just hold it for
about 10 to 15 seconds and then I will
finish off with these little bicycle
ones Blogilates recently showed these
and I love them I do about 10 on each
leg and then I will finish off with a
one-minute plank planks are so good for
your body and you can just feel them all
over your body so I love doing these and
I think it's a great way just to finish
off the ab exercises
so for butt exercises I will start off
by doing 30 of these donkey kick things
on each leg and then I will do 30 fire
hydrants on each leg and then I will
repeat the process but through 20 reps
on each leg and then I will slow down
with ten reps per leg and this looks so
funny and goofy but guys it hurts your
butt so bad it definitely recommend if
you're trying to get a stronger butts
for leg workouts I will do a song
exercise where I do 30 seconds of these
kind of sideways squats and then I will
just pulse for 30 seconds and then I
will do these froggy jumps trying to
touch the ground for 30 seconds and then
I will do switch lunges for 30 seconds
until I have finished the song I'll just
repeat
if it happens to not finish by the end
of the song I'll usually do it for about
three and a half minutes total and these
clips look really funny so I decided to
keep them in so for oblique workouts I
will just start off by taking a weight
and going down my leg for about a minute
and a half on each side and then I will
do candle six if I'm feeling it we're
all 230 on each side these hurt be so
bad and they're so hard I don't know why
forearm exercises I'll do another song
exercise or basically I push down for 20
seconds and then I will switch and I
will push up for 20 seconds and then I
will push forward for 20 seconds and
then I'll push back for 20 seconds I
know this looks kind of funny but it
really hurts and then I would just
circle for 20 seconds I'll circle
forward and then I'll circle backwards
for 20 seconds and then I'll do like
ballerina little exercises for 20
seconds and then I'll go to the middle
for 20 seconds and this really hurts
your arms especially if you hold for the
last like 10 seconds or so so that is
everything I have for my workout routine
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video let me know what you guys do for

jogging through the park or doing a
similar workout to mine I love hearing
