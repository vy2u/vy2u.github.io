me right now I'm moving is just so crazy
and it's so weird but a good weird and
here's the new beginning
we're waiting right now for the flights
aboard we're just kind of chilling out
it's like 5:00 a.m. right now we made it
good time headed on the plane right
watch the please captain
Oh
play and have a face won't you
rooms for me
Montebello
Hey so here tell me hey guys have it
talked since such a long time I think it
was like the morning time but we just
got to the hotel I'll show you guys the
view this is what we're working with
looks pretty nice
some guys sunbathing down there yeah
it's about 3:30 right now and I think
we're going to do the Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond
trip here soon but for now we're just
kind of like hanging out getting ready
for things Derick is here there is I
know it's been a long time since Derek
spittle
Barnes in the boring walking around try
to find a bathroom I don't know hey guys
so it's a lot a lot a lot later right
now but basically what happened so we
were having a really good time with
Avery in there if you were out eating
dinner we got some ramen which was
really good I've never had it before but
it tasted really good and then we got
back to the hotel we're just kind of
chilling out and then my dad said that
his flight got canceled and basically he
has one of my chip bags I use one of my
checked bags and it has like some very
important stuff like daily necessities
that you need and I have move in
tomorrow but this flight got canceled
because it was like raining really bad
they're really bad thunderstorms and so
basically oh but it was really really
bad and I basically just got canceled
and so we called him and he's like I
don't know what to do I'm probably gonna
have to go back home and then this bag
would just be like chilling somewhere
and it has like all my stuff for college
tomorrow it's like first day I'm like
seeing everybody meaning everybody I was
like my makeup is all like my comfy
clothes like my hair stuff my
straightener has basically my life in
this bag it's not about my life isn't
just makeup I mean it's something that
makes you feel good whenever you're
going back to college you want to feel
yourself and so basically had a large
meltdown very very bad just because it
was kind of like the turning point when
everything just kind of comes together
and then you burst that's what happened
so I went out it's like 10:30 and I had
to go to join Reed and basically rebuy
all of my makeup or like drugstore
products and other things like this
wonderful column here but basically
things that I literally need and so he's
math Airport since like 4 o'clock in the
afternoon and it's like 11:00 at this
point he was supposed to basically be
here by now
um and they told him that he could get
on a flight to Columbus have a three
hour layover and then get here by 8:00
a.m. tomorrow
it's basically traveling all throughout
the night and yes the three hour layover
but he's gonna be here so it was
everything that happened in honestly was
just really catastrophic and I think
didn't want to vlog because it was just
not fun and I was crying so but in the
end always thank your parents for
pulling through to think Jesus were
pulling through three it's ok a cry of
things go bad but you got to pick
yourself up and you just got to keep
going is my skin freaking out right now
