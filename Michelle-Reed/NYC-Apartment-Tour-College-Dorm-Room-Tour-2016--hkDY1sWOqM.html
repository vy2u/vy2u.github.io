guys this is literally so weird this is
my first video I'm filming here in my
apartment in New York City but I miss
you guys so much I haven't filmed like a
month so this is so exciting today I'm
going to be filming an apartment tour so
I live in a studio apartment with my
roommate Lauren who isn't here right now
so I'm not going to show her stuff just
like as courtesy to her I have a one
roommate and we live in this super cute
little studio apartment I honestly love
it the space is great and obviously like
by my wall and stuff I just really try
to make it kind of more of my kind of
place I also want to say that this
apartment is leased through my school so
while it is an apartment it's still
through the school so I'm not like off
campus technically on campus but I live
in New York City so just wanted to make
that clear as always if you're new you
should definitely subscribe I upload
once a week I also posting way more
often on my blog channel which is
Michelle out of her shell if you want to
check that channel out I post vlogs like
once or twice a week and I'm definitely
on there more than this channel recently
only on Instagram and Twitter as well
and snapchat at the shell read whitey
because all it is crazy I'll but I'm
still always posting on those so now
let's go ahead and get into the
apartment tour okay so this is the edge
meant to the room we have our nice
little mat here
by some huge really dirty though so
excuse that but basically come on in the
general overview of the place beyond so
basically like walk in and it's like
this little corner I think right here we
have a nice tool kit right there a
little fan and then this is my
full-length mirror just super nice just
like check yourself out before you leave
because we all do it but then right here
we I closet it which is actually super
nice so you just open the stand up and
this is the general life it's not too
too organized for the most part it's
pretty decent so right here we just have
like jackets and sweaters and then
dresses and like jumpsuits and a few
pairs of pants and then here I keep my
skirts and then just my shirt so I have
quite a few like dresses and skirts cuz
for class I wear business casual so I
kind of have to happen and just on my
shelves up here I have like boots and
stuff and then my heels which are not
very organized but they look like that
and then down here you can't really see
but I just have more boots and then all
my tennis shoes are down there and then
we have my backpack handy umbrella
because it rains right here we have like
underwear comfy clothes socks that kind
of stuff and then my towel my extra one
and then I just have my dirty clothes
right here and then my slippers per
trailer all the time and then up here is
kind of just like miscellaneous stuff
it's not very organized I'm a huge parka
for when it gets cold and then in my
purse iron and just like laundry stuff
so that's basically the gist of my
closet it's a super super good size I'm
really lucky to have it then right here
we have boring stuff which I don't
really like feel like I need to show
because if it's her stuff
- right here we have the lovely kitchen
which is pretty small but there's only
two of us so it's fine
so right here you just have like
microwave Keurig stuff up here Lauren
has food then we have our cute little
oven mitts which are honestly like
adorable they're like a decoration and
themselves all right here I love our
Keurig which Lauren brought and I'm so
blessed because obviously I like coffee
and I use it a lot our toaster
silverware stuff sink dishes that I
should have cleaned earlier but it
didn't all right here I'm just like
pantry stuff so like dishes lunch box
stuff this is Lauren's row and then I
have a couple rows and then we have mugs
up there I might do like a college
grocery haul I'm thinking so if you like
to see that on the hill in here this is
more like baking stuff and cooking stuff
and I've cereals so not that exciting
ovens stuff I love our little kitchen
towel thing that we don't use but it's
romantic ology and I think it's super
cute then we have our lovely fridge with
some bananas so we have our tiny freezer
which means like shove everything in
it's so small and then we have our
fridge which you know really like
section off be kind of just like put all
our stuff and I really like coffee so I
have a lot of keywords and I've been
logging the coconut creamer recently
it's really good that is the kitchen
they're right here we have my desk area
which I really like our printer is in
like a very inconvenient spot but
obviously it's pretty small in here so
we have our trash can and then right
here we have just like my desk space
it's not too organized but I'm not like
super organized I don't mind this lamp
is from Marshalls this cue is from
Earvin I have a picture of my sister and
then this choose grace sign is from a
brand called typesetter on instagram
she's super cool and she makes really
cool like typography things and she's
super sweet so definitely check her out
and then right here I just have like my
desk stuffs I have a folder sunglass
I kind of saw a cute little mug on my
pencils and shenanigans there and then
right here I just have my calendar which
I need to update and then just these
square pictures which my sister got me
and I love they're so cute and then down
here this stuff is kind of not that
organized but I have I make up right
here which is definitely not the best
organization but you know it works and
then we just have some like books and
stuff for class and like desk stuff and
that's basically it and then I chop my
trashcan my tripod and then my voiceover
might back here we have this super cute
little area with the ironing board not
super cute and then right here we have
Laurens closet which is really really
nice but I can show that and then here
we have the bathroom which is pretty
spacious it's decently large very tough
like Twitter it's tough sink stuff so
this is my staff this is blurring stuff
and then down here is just like hair
stuff and hair products shower curtain
then we have our nice little shower we
have really good natural lighting which
is awesome and I love it and that is it
for the bathroom and then right here I
have my favorite area this is my gallery
wall and this is definitely like my
favorite spot it has basically just
little parts of me I'll go through
