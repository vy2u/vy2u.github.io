because it is my college movement vlog
you guys requested this so much looking
back I'm from last year it's definitely
my favorite video that I've ever done
and so today I'm doing year 2 if you're
new to my channel and you're watching
this my name is Michelle Reed and I am a
sophomore in college and I go to the
Kings College in New York City and so I
moved from Texas to New York City and I
tried to document as much of it as
possible for you guys that I have a ton
of college content coming so you should
definitely subscribe if you're new also
been posting a lot on my Instagram story
here in the city so make sure you go
follow my Instagram shot read if you're
interested and yeah my room stopped done
this place is not nearly close to being
done but it is my little slice of
temporary home so I hope you guys enjoy
it
hi guys my leave for school in two days
so I have started to pack and I'm
basically trying to fit everything in -
giant suitcases and then in my carry-on
suitcase I won't put on my shoes and
they won't weigh anything down so right
now I'm like picking out all the clothes
I want this is so hard guys it's so hard
to bring your whole closet to school so
I'm packing down there right now as you
can see I'm like trying to be selective
with everything but at the same time I
just want to bring everything and it's
just so difficult I need to watch like a
minimalism documentary and change my
life but for now let's go
well sixteen so she's not coming to the
arable spot I'll see you guys in New
York
hi guys my undereyes are like really
light so ignorin currently and my
brother my sister-in-law's apart makes I
was staying here last night such a cute
place but it's about 9 o'clock right now
I'm about to head out to my apartment to
start the move-in blog I have my
suitcases
I'm already it's like super rainy today
like actually like thunderstorm 8 which
is quite possibly like the worst weather
you could have while you're trying to
move stuff by saying bye to the cutest
little kitty ever hello hey guys I just
got here this moment Halley hi a lot of
you guys have asked me consistently
looked here no she doesn't she's the
cutest but I like this man asked me who
I'm rooming with so that's Halley but we
just will Haley's been here for a while
but I just got here so I'll show you
guys what our apartment looks like right
now I haven't moved in any of my stuff
but Haley has done a lot so it is quite
empty and then we have a mere Haley has
a coat rack dedicated to her purses
they're so cute though actual coat this
is Haley side
my daddy's got it all it's cute we got a
TV a cute desk
this is my desk here's our cute little
window look Haley got these flowers and
they're so pretty this is our view it's
really rainy you got some cute buildings
this is my side is completely empty
because I haven't done anything this is
the kitchen
Haley is making some cereal I'm relaxing
yeah yeah they also really likes tea so
there's review here's the overview of
the room this is our bathroom queue and
then this is Haley's closet and Haley
also has a bookshelf we got some boxes
rather than there are literally bread
bins guys I'm about to fit all this
stuff in the apartment somehow because
Haley makes cookies she made everyone
cookies tonight she's the best hacking
is going pretty decently I went to
Target by myself and it was kind of a
struggle getting everything back but the
bed is all done still got a hang up
stuff on the walls
but this up Haley is working on getting
a sticker off of this but we're gonna
keep going it's like four o'clock right
now I think I might go get food in a
little bit but hi this is actually a
little bit later it is like August 23rd
today I just wanted to give you guys an
update on the room because I haven't
been for a while it's just been crazy
like getting everything like done and it
takes so long to put together a room the
rooms like not even close to being done
I figured this vlog would be better if I
just like put bits and pieces together
from the week it keeps it fun and
entertaining it's not like all the same
stuff so I wanted to show you guys the
bathroom because I recently picked up
some new things and so I'm gonna show
you guys what it looks like right now
wow this is a little bit farther down
the road I still feel like it might be
helpful to the Sur bathroom it's pretty
small it's also really old like all the
stuff and it's pretty old so trying to
make it cute right now but I'm gonna
show you guys what we have they've got
this toilet seat cover guys and it is so
fuzzies from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond you guys
don't even understand how excited this
makes me this is like the smallest thing
ever but it makes the biggest difference
and this was like my splurge item so I'm
proud of myself
you got this rod down here this is also
from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond it's really
simple and plain towels here this shower
curtain is an interesting color but I
got this from society6 for you and I put
it up and it's like I've never seen a
shower curtain that's like actually this
orange but honestly it kind of makes me
happy in the morning whenever I see it
cuz I just like think of a sunshine or
something so but I got this bath mat
that literally looks like pebbles my
boyfriend told me that
get this and so I got it so that's my
little bathroom update I also wanted to
say if you're in college getting fresh
flowers if you can like afford the
splurge it makes all the difference as
well like right now I currently have
flowers up here these are sunflowers and
they just make me so happy in the
morning right below my window I also
have sunflowers I just think they're
really pretty and they add just such a
nice little touch and when you wake up
in the morning and you see this view it
just makes me happy and so I would
definitely recommend it also up here on
the wall I hung up a few things this
c'est la vie poster was that urban it
was on sale it's not straight though
like it's bent and it's bothering me but
I'm trying to ignore it and then also on
this fall I put up my gallery wall I
didn't put up as much stuff as I had
last year and this guy is literally
about to come off they have a few pieces
from that the only new one from last
year that I didn't have was this and it
is also from society6 I just think it's
a nice little message up there so hope
you guys enjoyed watching this moving
vlog I'm definitely interested if you're
moving into college where you go to
school

seeing where all my subscribers are from
