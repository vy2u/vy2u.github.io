because it's going to be my studio
apartment tour in New York City slash
kind of dorm tour so I'm in college but
we have apartments instead of like dorms
because this in the New York City so
that's kind of how it works the place is
really really small and I actually live
with a roommate her name is Naja and
most of the stuff is actually hers in
the room cuz I just moved in here and
I'm really thankful she decorated it so
nicely it's like a super warm cozy place
and we have so many lights and things oh
yeah I really hope you guys enjoyed
watching this tour I'll have most of the
stuff linked down below I can find it if
not it's probably not available if it's
not down there and if you're new you
should definitely subscribe to my name
is Michelle and I make beauty and
fashion in college videos and let's just
go ahead and get right into the tool so
starting off we have the entryway we
have some coats here this is my closet
which is actually pretty big for a
closet in New York so I really like it
however I don't have anywhere to put my
suitcase right now so it's just kind of
there
everyone's already closed down there
which is also probably not very cute but
and that's like a ton of space there's a
lot of shoe space so I just keep all my
shoes right there which I have like way
too many for this room but that's ok and
then also I have my clothes here and I
don't really organize them by type of
clothes or anything I kind of just hang
them up because usually when I try to
organize them it doesn't last we have
this little corner and there's just like
shoes down there a full-length mirror
and it's really dark that's why we put
up the lights here and then also have
this little sign which I would set so I
really like that we made some semester
goals so like before we go out the door
we can just look at them but those are
there these are my roommate najin's of
ice skates right here I just keep like
clothes and such and this little bin and
you walk over here so this is my bed up
here I have two lofted bed and I really
like it as you can see we really like
the lights in here just because it makes
it really cozy but for my bedding this
pink do they cover it sort XE most of my
clothes are from Target and then my
German Shepherd is for remembering Roxy
and it was
aaden's I also have a blanket down here
and then below that we just have like
the kind of hangout area actually really
like this space
I decided to keep my bed lofted so we
could have this under here but I don't
know where these are from
but the blanket in the middle is
actually from Target so and then up here
is have some flowers and then that's not
just devotional cute little salt lamp
lots of lights but really like this
space just for like reading or doing
homework that kind of stuff it's really
really nice and then right here we have
our like eating place which is really
nice because I've never actually had a
table but nacho had this in here so I'm
forever grateful for that so you set
some flowers and emanates is actually a
scarf that she put down so let me just
have some cheer pads that kind of thing
a little clock our kitchen is pretty
tiny right here we just have her spices
and then we just have a microwave up
here and this is all of not just food
plates and stuff and there this has kind
of random things up here is just coffee
you know how the dishwasher sweet the
dryer stuff and I didn't put those up
before this that's why they are still
out and then we have the fridge we were
saying yesterday our fridge looks like a
thirty year old mom fridge cuz like look
at everything everything's so fresh I
was really impressed we have a lot of
produce in here but we really like to
eat good foods and then up there I just
have my pantry stuff and then a few
notches decorations right there man this
is her apron right here was just the
window and such we're only on the second
floor so you probably can't see cuz it's
super bright but there's a really nice
view out there the tree and everything
and then this is actually not just side
of the room so I don't know where any of
this stuff is exactly from but it's
super cozy and cute that I think all of
our bedding is actually from
Anthropologie so I was where all of that
is from right here we have my desk and
it's kind of cluttered right now it's
I'm not super organized yet but I just
have this lamp which is from world
market I think this
this little jewelry holder is from Urban
Outfitters then I just have a picture
stuff to put random stuff in my black
camera so you see there except been
blogging a lot which if you want to
check those out
it's Michelle out of her shell self
promo I've been vlogging a lot so I
don't picture of me and Rose right there
and some nice little flowers that is it
obviously I am in school so you use this
space a lot and then underneath areas
have books and stuff but it's a little
letter so we're not gonna go too close
there and we also still have our
stockings up in our little tree because
Christmas goes until January around here
cuz we really like the festive spirit
but not just desk is also beside mine
but I don't want to like show her stuff
because it's her stuff myself so and
then we're gonna walk right into the
bathroom which is really really nice our
bathroom has really good just natural
lighting you have this super nice little
color wheel picture which Nadja actually
got but I think it's from paper source
if you are interested no they're just a
little clock and then in here there's
just kind of toiletry products which I
like to heat to a minimum because
obviously if you don't have a ton of
storage in here because this is New York
City and you don't really get a lot of
space but my stuff is on the top two
tiers up here it's just kind of like
everyday stuff that I liked you and then
we have the sink right here some cute
little fake flowers and below the sink I
just have a lot of makeup products and
hair products which the top stuff is not
just stuff and then down here I just
have my stuff below it that is what is
under there nothing too interesting and
then obviously we just have this shower
like great for you which is nice and
bright I don't know where a shower
curtain is from but so kind of fits the
vibe so that is the end of my dorm slash
apartment tour I hope you guys enjoy
this video the space is really smaller I
think we've really done a good job of
like utilizing all the storage and stuff
so I hope you guys enjoyed this make
sure to subscribe to see my next video
next week and also make sure to check
out my vlogs because I've been blogging
a ton and yeah I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
