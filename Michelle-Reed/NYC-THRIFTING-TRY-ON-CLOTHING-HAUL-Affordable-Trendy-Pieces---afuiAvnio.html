a thrift store haul I'm so excited
if you guys don't know I recently opened
up a blog it's called the shy girls
guide to growing up it's actually part
of my marketing class so if you want to
help out my lovely GPA feel free to
check it out I'm doing a post all about
how to find really good thrift stores in
New York City on with my 15 tips along
with just how to in general budget and
still be able to buy things that you
like that are really cute so if you want
to check out the blog post that is in
collaboration with this video it'll be
linked down below sit in a blog while we
were thrift shopping when my sister is
here in the city so you want to check
that out it's not michelle out of your
shell also have a card right here you
can click my name is michelle and if you
don't know I live in New York City so I
recently hit up Williamsburg and I found
so many good fruit vines I've never
found like this many good things at once
I'm pretty sure that's kind of why I'm
say so if you like thrifting let me know
your favorite thrift store down below
and let's just go ahead and get right
into this video first we went to
crossroads which is in Williamsburg and
they had some great stuff I first found
this Zara shirt and it's still pretty
cold in New York City it's like 35 today
so I don't write you jumpsuit but he's
from Zara it's just like a cropped
sweater and it's really really fuzzy and
soft and it has this really cute collar
that has a black trim on it and then
also it has the black trim on the short
sleeves and so I love this I think that
this is great for class because I have
to wear business casual so I thought
this talk would be really cute and this
was only about 15 dollars I think and it
feels basically new at this dress which
is actually from forever 21 originally
but it's just like this denim dress and
it's kind of like shredded or on the top
and around the short sleeves and then
it's frayed at the ends as well I
thought that this would be so cute with
just like some converse or even some
like tan booties and tights if it's
still a little too cold in New York City
I love simple little dresses like this I
thought this was so cute and I believe
this was only like nine dollars so it
was pretty cheap lastly at Crossroads I
got this dress this is I think the most
expensive thing that I got but it is
from Tommy Hill
dear and it just as he'll figure on it
and it's like this sweatshirt kind of
dress and I love this I live her stuff
like this I think it's so comfy just
with some high-top converse running
errands around the city I think that
this is gonna be so nice if you want to
see how I styled these things make sure
to follow me on Instagram that Michelle
Reed I think this was like twenty two
dollars and not this pair of jeans also
at Crossroads and he's actually wet
because I just washed them and so I
think want stick them in the dryer so
these are gonna be kind of like cold to
try on obviously these are gonna be like
not everyone's style but they're
originally from Zara I got these for I
think twenty dollars but they have a
little like floral print on them they're
so cute and they're very distressed and
then at the bottom they do like a fringe
detail at the bottom which looks weird
right now it's wet but it's really cute
when they're dry promise these are so
cute I haven't worn low-rise jeans and
forever and these literally it came with
the tag on them and so these were never
worn and they were 20 bucks from sorrow
which I think it's a good price so
there's actually a goodwill and I think
this was the one really close to
Washington Square Park so many good
things in it but I got this dress which
is the brand Tokyo Fashion Co I've never
heard of it but it's this really cute
spring day tea floral dress it's so
girly and it has the prettiest like hem
at the bottom and it's just so flowy and
cute I'm like a total girly girl so I
live for stuff like this
I just think it is so pretty for spring
I posted this picture on my Instagram
and I think it's really cute truly madly
deeply which I think it's from PacSun
I'm pretty sure but it's just like this
army green dress it's really simple this
is like one of my favorite colors I just
think that it's a really pretty color
when you're tan and it basically ties
around the waist about like a mini size
but I think this is so cute and I'm so
excited to wear this it warms up in New
York City with some tennis shoes I think
it'll be really cute I posted a picture
of this skirt on my Instagram you guys
were going crazy asking where it was
from and it has no brain
so I have no idea is this gingham wrap
skirt it is beautiful and has it ruffles
on the bottom you guys know I love me a
good wrap skirt and so this is like so
modest and pretty it really reminds me
of Kristen John's something like this
and so I totally pick this up and this
is like me the skirt I think it's so
cute and I love it and it was only $15
which is a steal even though we don't
know what the brand is I forgot which
store I got this shirt from but it's
really really plain it's just this
button-down shirt and it's white and
it's like really thin this also doesn't
have a brand but it's really simple I
have a habit of buying pants dresses and
skirts but I never buy tops as you can
see from this video so I thought this
would be good just to have I think
tucked into high-waisted light wash
jeans this will be a really cute top to
have we finished off with no relation
vintage and guys I found a pair of
overalls I've been wanting to find
overalls for such a long time and I can
never find ones that fit me right this
pair is so cute it's just like a really
classic it looks like something you buy
from made well pair of overalls it has
like little patches on it the brand
Cherokee I think it might be like a
kid's jumpsuit it's a large it's pretty
small I also has really cute rose gold
detailing on it I love this I think this
is $18 which is such a good price for
like overalls and I think that is so
cute and I cannot wait to wear this in
Texas in the summertime or in the
springtime here it forms up anytime soon
these last two things I'm just throwing
in these weren't thrifted but I ordered
these from do't if you don't know what
dope is it's an online shopping app
you've heard my spiel use my code
Michelle and you will get five dollars
off which is a steal haven't linked up
below if you want to download it I
bought these two pairs of Madewell pants
the first ones these are they're Cali
denim jeans and they basically button up
and then at the bottom they flare out
I'm so over skinny jeans I'm so ready to
wear like some wide pants and so I think
that these are so cute and they're
comfortable they're dark wash and I love
these they're pretty pricy but they're
really great quality jeans
and this pair I like cannot even believe
I think they're adorable it's this plaid
pair of pants they are just really
simple they look like kind of like graph
paper and then at the bottom they are
SuperDuper wide cut and these are
adorable
I got these and a size 24 tall they run
pretty true to size to your jean size
and so I really like these I'm five
seven so I usually get the tall pairs of
pants from a tall because I like my
pants a little bit longer but these are
so cute I think they're gonna be so
adorable with like some heads and like a
bodysuit tucked in walking around New
York City so cute so those are all the
things that I thrifted slash bought from
me while I'm sorry I slid those in but I
hope you guys enjoyed again leave down
