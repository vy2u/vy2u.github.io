mowing noises in the background I've
been waiting for them to stop but
they're not so we're just gonna keep
going I'm gonna be doing a New Year's
Eve hair make up an outfit video so this
is just something that I think would be
good for her party hanging out with
friends the makeup is really really
pretty and glowy and kind of smoky a
little more than you usually wear the
hair is very very simple and then the
outfit is just very classy I'm not a
huge glitter person so none of this
stuff is like BAM check out this glitter
which I know some people are into which
is okay but this is more just a subdue
New Year's look if you're new to my
channel you should definitely subscribe
the button will be right here I upload
every Sunday and Thursday or Sunday or
Thursday at berries I wanted out that my
giveaway is still going on so you should
definitely check that out you could win
a Crossley record player friends
headphones a perfume set just really
awesome stuff so definitely check that
out down below and let's just go ahead
and get into the video so here is a very
glowy pink makeup look that we're going
for I'm starting off with my Smashbox
photo-finish primary to really smooth
out my face and then I'm applying some
concealer to my eyelids as primer and
setting that concealer with some
translucent powder I'm applying my inked
in pink color tattoo from Maybelline to
the inner half of my eye and then I'm
taking bad to the bronze and applying
this to the outer V and the inner corner
and kind of connecting the two through
the crease and then I'm taking my Naked
3 palette I'm applying nooner over top
of those dark shades connecting them in
the crease and then over top of that I'm
applying Blackheart to kind of darken up
the crease in the inner corner I'm then
spraying my brush with some fix+
and then I'm going to be applying my
buzz eyes shadow from my Naked 3 palette
over top of that peach shade and then I
am using the color trick over top of
that and then lastly finishing off of
the shade dust it gives it a very pretty
shimmery look and then I'm highlighting
with a cream shade which is strange and
then I'm mixing all of those glitter
colors and I'm applying them to my inner
lash line and then taking black art and
I'm a fly
to the outer lash line then I'm using
these Ardell natural lashes I'm just
applying those filling in my brows with
my Anastasia brow pencil and then just
finishing off with some mascara this is
the rocket mascara I'm using my
covergirl Ready Set gorgeous foundation
all over my face for concealer I'm using
my Maybelline fit me shade and I'm
applying this in a triangle motion
underneath my eyes and blending it out
with my Beauty Blender and then I'm
setting everything with my Rimmel stay
matte powder to lock it all in
I am contouring with my hoola bronzer
just to give my face a chiseled look
then I'm applying my benefit blush and
rock tour it's a nice pink peachy color
and then I'm highlighting with Watts up
from benefits I really love this
highlighter it's super pretty and we're
finishing off with airy-fairy from
Rimmel which is a nice light pink
lipstick shade and that's it for the
makeup for hair I'm starting off with
some dry shampoo to give my hair some
texture and then I am giving myself a
very dramatic side part and teasing all
the hair around the roots and then I am
just fishtail braiding my hair so if you
don't know how to do this you basically
just take small chunks of hair and you
cross them over to the other side until
it's all the way down and then I'm
securing it and loosening it up a lot
this is what gives it a lot of texture
and makes it very funky is just pulling
out hairs and loosening it you can also
take it another step and turn it into a
side button though all you have to do is
take the braid and twist it around
itself and then pin it into place it
super cute it's definitely a little more
fancy I would opt for this hairstyle
personally I think it's so pretty now my
outfit is a little more casual I'm
wearing this dress from brandy melville
it's a nice wine color to suede dress
and then my necklace is from Francesca's
my hat is from Urban Outfitters which is
definitely optional and then my booties
are from choies I know this isn't super
glittery and fun but it's more me and
more subdued and I think it's good for
those who aren't super out there
we really hope you guys like this video

film and I really hope it gave you guys
