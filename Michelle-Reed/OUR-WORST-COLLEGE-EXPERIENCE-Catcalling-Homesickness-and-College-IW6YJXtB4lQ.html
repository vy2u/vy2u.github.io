am here with my friends rose and roses
roommate Leah and today we are all in
college so we thought we were gonna do
like a college cue today and so I asked
for questions on my Instagram which is
at-michelle read if you want to follow
me and be in the next one you so should
be like I'll go to like different
colleges we're at Parsons School of
Design in Manhattan so I'm studying
photography and she's studying fashion
design dynamic King so if you don't we
all like different experiences I can
like show different someone asked what
our worst experiences at college are so
far
basically we thought we had bedbugs in
our apartment which if you guys live in
New York you know that that's like a big
fear because they're really common here
but basically like I woke up and I'll
insert a picture of my face but it was
like covered in these bites it was so
mean to me I was like and that wasn't
the virus or experience that I've had
because basically if you get bedbugs see
it's like bag everything in your room
you just like wash everything and it's
like the worst mine because this suite
was horrible this week has just been
more about me yeah I was doing a really
cool dress I something when everything
went wrong after leave and now it looks
like a hospital yeah hard to see the
picture look well I'll send that to you
if you want to yeah I got food poisoning
freshmen yeah back back because I missed
like five classes yeah how do you stay
motivated when you fail at something you
tried really hard ah I thought you kind
of have to laugh yeah
fail I can't like the only then you can
do it like you can cry a little bit but
you need to be like mostly just laughing
but like oh man and also like for
college it's not necessarily like your
grades that matter so much
it's that you pass the cough you just
laugh about it and then you never think
about it again
that's what I get all of my essays it's
like oh I gotta go back and read this no
I'm in just a minute never leave that's
so true though if you know what's bad
you're just like yeah remoter you're
trying to shoot and all my photos were
due tomorrow it was pouring rain outside
this is due tomorrow and I just didn't
repeat the question yes how to make the
true slash right friends and colleges
and freshmen you have a lot more friends
than you realize that you have seen them
but people you talk to you like in
classes and the people that you like
associate yourself with in classes or
ask questions too those people are
likely gonna consider you their friend -
because freshmen you don't have a lot of
friends so like okay let's go grab
coffee after lunch or let's go do this
and like nine times out of 10 they're
gonna say yes yeah it's like everyone
wants to make friends freshmen here I
feel like if anyone like invites you out
your be like how we became friends I was
just in class does take time I feel like
to find like actually yeah I give it
like by the end of your first semester
you'll realize like oh I have to work
with people that I'm like constantly
like going and I go to people you're
probably not friends with like all the
people that y'all were friends with like
freshman year yeah yeah we were scared
to move away for college and if so how
do you just tell yourself to do it
I'm proved by so it's pretty far I
wasn't scared I was really excited but
when I came here I was just like wait I
know I'm like all alone but also Ria's
was what 15 million with here no 16 so
16 when you moved here yeah I guess you
just have to get used to it like once
you find friends and you're hanging out
and are always busy I feel like yeah we
talked about this too like I got really
homesick first semester last year but
like if you find the right people to
live with and like you live with your
friends yeah you just feel so much more
at home and like if you make your dorm
or apartment feel like homey and not
like sterile or like old then that's how
they feel it feels like pretty gross
officially living here in New York I
just feel like it's so crazy that like
having a home base that just like feels
like home yeah it's like like feel
comfortable and like that helps what is
the face thing you struggle with in your
major
for me it's finding something that's
like different to shoot and that's also
like house meeting and not just being
like a surface level shooting
photography there's so many
photographers there's a story yeah and I
feel like a lot of the stuff that for me
that I've been shooting is just very
like oh this is really cool photo but it
has no like meaning for me so I'm
my mom's facetiming filming right now do
you ever feel unsafe in New York City I
hear a lot about the unsafe especially
for a girl I just think this is a really
important question because I feel like
people are really creepy in New York
City and we've got a story I was leaving
and some guy grabbed my butt and Marie
Turner actually like your Barbie it was
like I literally wanted to throw up a
circus like no matter what you're
wearing no matter like what time it is
like guys are like great but at the same
time it's not like I walk around and I'm
constantly I never you think about it
it's not something where you're
cleansing and you feel unsafe I can walk
around here like especially where we
live like lower Manhattan at like 10:00
p.m. and feel completely safe special
areas especially that you learn so like
Union Square I avoided all cost I'm like
obviously walking alone like you hadn't
been incident this week yeah it was not
great it wasn't an area had been to and
I didn't know how it was but it wasn't
far away from where I was going so I
just decided to walk but then something
happened I had a panic attack on the
streets which I've never had I've never
experienced but I think like that yeah
you had it hadn't happened to you before
but you handled it well you like went to
like a policeman oh yeah I just
following me I didn't go down until I
knew there was like someone around but I
think the best thing that you can do is
literally like tunnel vision keep
walking never like encourage it or like
say something or acknowledge even if you
want to be like snarky be like you don't
go just continue to follow you I had a
guy follow me and my friend actually was
like a group of guys following me and my
friend one time after class it's like
11:00 a.m. and they were just like
following us he like went into a store
they followed us into the store so he
went into the bank across the street and
like told the security guard and like he
like walked us back to our dorms yeah
yeah just like be around people never
like put yourself in a situation where
you're gonna be by yourself especially
at night yeah or you don't know where
you're going go it's like your friend
and like don't be walking on your phone
- I think it's also really important
like even if you have headphones and I
like that's okay better be more likely
to like for me out walk around with
Peppa and that's when I feel like I get
talked to those because they're like oh
you're no listen to music so yeah yeah
yeah always listen to music and the one
time I wasn't that happen yeah okay walk
with purpose does happen a lot and like
people don't realize yeah I didn't
realize it I didn't think I always
thought people like over-exaggerated
like catcalling yeah I like walk through
or like this is how often it happens but
it does what it really does it happens
more in like Midtown I've never I've
been like felt like endangered I've just
been uncomfortable by it makes you feel
like you're just like yeah yeah I know I
go every time happens in like shower
looks like I'm not in my sweats
stop telling me I'm an animal so that is
all the questions that we're gonna
answer I hope you guys enjoyed meeting
