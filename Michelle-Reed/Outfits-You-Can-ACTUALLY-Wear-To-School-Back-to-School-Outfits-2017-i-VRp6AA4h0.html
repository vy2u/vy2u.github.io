you to my channel you should definitely
subscribe this video is my first
back-to-school video and this is going
to be a back-to-school outfits video
that you can actually wear to school so
basically these are all albums that
would fit you know your average public
high school dress code so I say the way
for things that are super short things
that were cropped things that were
really tight I know a lot of times
people will make these videos and a lot
of times you watch them and be like yo I
cannot wear that crop tops to school I'm
also likely doing a business casual look
book for those who are in a professional
setting and then also in outfits video
with outfits that are more affordable
also all the pieces that I mentioned in
this video are going to be linked down
below if I can't find something I'm
going to leak something that's a little
bit similar if this video is super early
for you that's totally ok this is just
to give you some ideas that gives you
starting back-to-school shopping let me
know down below what grade you're going
into next year or throw into college let
me know what college you're going to and
that's pretty much everything next day
so let's go ahead and get right into the
outfit so I love this first outside
because I think it's really girly with
the skirt but adding tennis shoes really
gives it kind of a more casual vibe
which is great for school my skirt is
from forever 21
I love the button details on it it's
great and it's super long for school so
you don't have to worry about getting
dress coded my shoes are the rifle Paper
Company kids I love them they're so
comfortable and then my top is from
Aries as caffeine Queen on it I just
think it's really cute I watch is from
Daniel Wellington and then my ring is
also from made while now this outfit
might be a little bit too crazy for some
of you guys at school but maybe for the
first day of school I thought it would
be cute my pants are from forever 21 and
then my white shirt is from Uniqlo then
my little flats are from j.crew I really
like the pointed toes on them I just
think they make them look a lot more
elegant they're also super duper
comfortable like literally these are so
comfy especially if you're sitting
around at school all day going from
class to class they're a really great
pair of pants to have
so for this outfit I'm just wearing some
high-waisted jeans from made well I
think the buttons on them are really
really cute they're kind of just cropped
at the bottom and then I'm just wearing
these Steve Madden little slip-on shoes
that have a little bit of a heel but not
too much for school it's just the right
amount I top is from Urban Outfitters I
just tucked it into the pants and then I
paired it with a little scar from Old
Navy I love these little scarves because
I think they just add the perfect amount
of color to any outfit and they also
just look really sophisticated and for
my last outfit I again love this because
it's a dress but it looks super casual
with the tennis shoes my dress is from
American Apparel and since it was a
little bit tighter I just wrapped a
flannel around my way so it would be
more dress code appropriate I'm also
just wearing high-top converse and this
flannel is just from H&amp;amp;M if you're
wondering and now that's it for my
outfit I also wanted to say my backpack
is from personal supply if you're
wondering I'll try to link it down below
