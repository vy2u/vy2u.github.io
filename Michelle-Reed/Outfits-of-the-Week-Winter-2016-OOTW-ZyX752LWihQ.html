that I'm so excited for guys I love
outfit of the week videos and so this is
going to be a winter one and what a
typical week of outfits looks like for
me there are three things that I want to
say before I start this video one some
of these outfits maybe a little bit out
of range when it comes to climate I know
a lot of places are a lot colder than
Texas and so you can't necessarily go
out and some of the things that I showed
you guys but you can always modify them
to fit your climate if you please
second I only have four outfits in this
video because usually Friday I wear
something chill and I didn't really feel
like going out into the video so I just
have my naked Thursday and lastly I got
to work with a super cool company called
zoo shoe in this video which sells
really awesome shoes they have awesome
brands like Steve Madden and they're
just an incredible site and I love them
I actually love them so much that I went
yesterday I bought another pair of shoes
after receiving like four pairs I'm a
shoe a holic I would definitely
recommend you guys check them out
they're doing a giveaway right now where
you can win a free pair of shoes and 50%
off a pair of shoes so you should
definitely check that out it'll be the
first link in the description box so now
that being said let's go ahead and roll
the office of the week so my first
outfit is definitely my favorite this is
a pair of overalls that I recently got
from H&amp;amp;M and they are an army green
color I absolutely love them they are so
so pretty and I just paired it with a
plain black long-sleeve shirt underneath
and then my watch is from Daniel
Wellington and my necklace is from the
brand made well just very simple jewelry
now I absolutely love the shoes for this
outfit they are a pair of black white
and gray Oxford's from the brand's ooh
shoe I will have them linked down below
but they're so comfortable and just kind
of make that outfit more casual yet cute
at the same time it's a really really
good combination and also don't forget
to enter their giveaway the link will be
down below and that's it for my Monday
outfit I love it it's cute and comfy and
a great way to start off the week
now this outfit definitely shows off my
Texan vibes I love it my jacket was
actually my aunt's from the 60s and I
love it has fringe on it it's so out of
my comfort zone but I love it and she
passed away a while back so I think it's
really cool that I got to include it in
this video and the top I am wearing is
from Urban Outfitters it's just a flowy
blouse and then I paired it with a
colorful airy scarf it's a blanket scarf
keeps me warm love it and then my shoes
are actually from the brand Steve Madden
super cute and they go great with the
jacket
oh now Wednesday's outfit is channeling
my inner neutrals I love black and white
together I'm wearing this leather jacket
which is from brandy melville it's super
by Kurush rakesh again out of my comfort
zone but I love it and then I'm wearing
a peplum top from H&amp;amp;M below it with an
H&amp;amp;M necklace I love these shoes guys
these are from Zeus shoe as well and
they're healed and they're black and
speckled and I love them they'll be
linked down below along with all the
other clothing pieces but I am so so
into these boots right now guys I just
think this outfit is great it almost has
like a New York vibe I tell myself I
like that when you tie my hair
so take and now Thursday's outfit is
definitely the most relaxed I have on
this crop top which is a really pretty
orange color from forever 21 with a
brandy melville cardigan over it I wear
this cardigan like every day guys I love
it and my black jeans are from Urban
Outfitters they're a little bit high
waisted but not super high waisted and I
have on a couple of necklaces from
PacSun my shoes are these really comfy
almost van like metallic shoes they
really make any outfit more casual and
they're also from Zeus shoe and I love
them and I've been wearing them a lot
because I'm not a big sneaker person but
these are like cute sneakers that is
that for my office guys I really hope
you guys enjoyed this video I have a
pretty relaxed yet classy style I would
say and I just really enjoyed showing
