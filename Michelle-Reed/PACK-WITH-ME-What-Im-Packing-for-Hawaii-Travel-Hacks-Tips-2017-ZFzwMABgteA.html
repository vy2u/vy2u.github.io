showing you guys what I am packing for
Hawaii along with my traveling tips my
packing tips all that good stuff don't
know why under my eyes so why I'm going
to quiet from the 11th through the 19th
of May in your noon
make sure to hit that button down below
and subscribe I uploaded twice a week
I'm also going to be vlogging a ton in
Hawaii so make sure to hit that
subscribe button on my blog channel
which is the shell out of your shell
that's pretty much everything I have to
say for this video so go ahead and get
right into it
hey whoa check up a new Roxy so my
luggage that I'm bringing is actually
Hartman luggage
I love the suitcase it's so durable and
it looks good and it's just really
really pretty so starting off the
toiletries I am packing my white with
style teeth whitening kit I love this
teeth whitening kit because it really
makes my teeth look nice and white
because I drink a ton of coffee like
guys so much coffee basically how this
works is it is a kit that comes with the
molds the light a syringe of the actual
like whitening gel these vitamin E swabs
and that is everything in the kit
basically all I do is brush my teeth
before I put the teeth whitening kits in
and then I just go ahead and I place a
little dollop of the actual gel in each
one of the molds and each one of the
tooth or teeth and then I put the molds
in and I let them sit for about thirty
minutes and then I put in the light
basically I will just read a book watch
some vlogs do whatever I want to do I
actually really love this kit because
it's cruelty free and it's vegan which I
know a lot of you guys watching this are
probably vegan so it's great they also
have an offer right now where they have
three packs of their flavoured teeth
whitening pens for $26.99 which is such
a good deal and then after 30 minutes my
teeth are super white and clean and very
pretty so I love my white with style
whitening kit and if you would like to
try it I actually have my own coupon
code it is Michelle r28 you guys should
definitely use it because instead of the
kit being two hundred and sixty nine
dollars and ninety nine cents it's only
$28 which is such a good deal so I will
have everything linked down below for my
makeup I am packing a dark foundation a
nice glowing moisturizer highlighter
