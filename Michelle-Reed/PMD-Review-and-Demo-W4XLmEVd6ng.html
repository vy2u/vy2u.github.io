was sent to me about a week ago or so it
is called the PMD key of e stands for a
personal microderm and yeah also I want
to say that I know my christmas tree is
still up I just haven't gotten to taking
it down also my lights finally work in
my room so I can now fill my room again
so thank you grandpa so when you order
your PMD it comes in a box like this and
I'll show you everything that comes with
it so you get an instructional DVD and
booklet which make sure before you do
any treatments on your face you read and
watch the video because it's really
important or else you could scab or
scratch your face by using it improperly
this is what everything comes in so
first you get the actual PMD which looks
like this it's just a little like
machine looking thing looks like this it
has like nice green stuff on the side
which you can grip really nice you know
that's weird but feels kind of all it
comes with some brush heads so you get
all these different ones so there is a
white one which is to be used if it's
your first time using the PMD it's just
kind of a tester one so you can test it
on your neck or behind your ear I think
we're the two places you also get two
blue ones I think these are the
sensitive skin ones these are the ones
that I use and I really like these ones
once you're used to the sensitive skin
one you can use the green one it's a
little bit tougher and I think there's a
red one as well for like really tough
skin and then you get these kind of big
circle ones which are used on your body
so you know if you just have like acne
on your back or your legs then you can
use the bigger ones you also get another
little plastic cap this is the one for
your body and then in this box is just
the cord or the power cord that you plug
it in before you're going to use your
PMV so if you don't know what
microdermabrasion is honestly I didn't
know what it is before I sell this
product um basically it's just a
treatment that's done at a salon it's to
help you get younger looking skin but
basically it's 75 to three hundred
dollars per session at a dermatologist
and then your recommended to do six or
seven treatments so that can be almost
two thousand dollars and that's just
really expensive I don't really know
anybody who wants to spend that much
money on a face treatment I wouldn't
also have to set up appointments and
then just like free of your schedule in
all this and I feel like doing it
personally with your own microderm
system is a lot easier this is one
hundred and eighty dollars which yes I
do understand is a lot of money I'm not
doubting that but if you actually got it
done at a salon it can be up to two
thousand dollars so definitely I would
recommend using this instead of getting
it done at a dermatologist so right now
I'm going to go into a demo of how to
actually use the microderm I used it
myself and yeah so let's just go ahead
and get into that before starting any
treatments make sure to watch the
instructional DVD and pamphlet so first
I'm just going to be throwing my hair up
in a bun to get it out of my face next
I'm using my Neutrogena makeup remover
wipes because it's important that you
don't have any makeup on before using
your PMD I'm also going to cleanse my
skin with my deep clean cleanser to just
scrub off any remains of makeup that
still may be on my face now you are
ready to use your PID so plug in the
cord and then insert it into the PMD and
turn it clockwise if it's your first
time using the PMD make sure to test
your skin with the Whitehead and then
you can move to the blue one for
sensitive skin and if your skin's a
little tougher then you can use the
green one make sure that if you're using
this on your body you use the bigger
heads so just insert it into the little
needle thing and then twist the cap on
the head should be just a little bit
below the plastic cap you first turn it
on the noise may be a little scary but
you get used to it after a couple of
sessions so I'm just gonna pull my skin
to one side and then move the PMD over
my skin make sure you don't go over an
area more than twice it's really
important or else it'll irritate it also
always keep the PMD moving do not just
stop or your skin can scab over and
that's not very pretty your skin maybe a
little bit red after using it as well
but honestly it goes away within 2-3
hours or so so it's not really that big
of a deal
first time using it the feeling kind of
feels a little weird like it's sucking
your face away but honestly you get used
to it after a couple sessions and it
just feels like nothing never ever use
the PM Dr on your eyes either that's a
big no and just follow up with a toner
afterwards to rejuvenate your skin I'm
also going to moisturize my skin with my
sri moisturizer and you have finished
your session with your PMD so after i
used by micro doom for the first time my
face afterwards felt so smooth i
recently had a stroke brash and I my
skin has just been really really dry as
a result of that and literally the day
after I use this like all that dry skin
was just off and it felt so good it was
awesome and I've never really felt like
my skin feels so glowy like I just want
to feel my skin all the time because it
feels really really nice so when you
actually plug it in it sounds like this
which I know may sound kind of scary but
you honestly get used to it after a
couple sessions I'm like completely used
to it now and it's honestly that's scary
it's recommended that you wait six to
seven days in between treatments which I
wish I could use this every day because
I love it so much if you are interested
in purchasing the personal microderm I
have my own discount code and it is this
is finally in shell just like my youtube
name and instead of the PMD being around
180 i believe it's around like 130 or
140 so you save about forty dollars by
using the coupon code so i would really
suggest using it if you're going to buy
your own to order your own microderm i
will link the link in the downbar it'll
be like the first one in the description
box you'd have to worry about like
looking through it'll just be the first
one there I'm pretty sure I've cleared
up everything about my thoughts on the
PMD I hope you guys enjoyed this little
review and I will see you guys my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
