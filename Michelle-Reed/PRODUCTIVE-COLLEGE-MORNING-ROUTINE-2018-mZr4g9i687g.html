approximately like 8 o'clock which is
usually whenever I wake up on the days
that I don't have class to 1:30 my name
is Michelle Reid I make college videos I
go to the Kings College in New York City
so I am a college student in New York
City which is crazy
you should definitely stick around and
subscribe if you're new I'm making more
College lifestyle videos all the time so
definitely stick around today is a
Monday and so I don't have class till
1:30 which means I have a ton of time to
have a really productive morning routine
so I'd like to do a lot of work I like
to do homework I like through my Bible I
like to really focus and be intentional
my mornings because I think if you start
the morning right the rest of your day
is just so much better and so this is
gonna be showing you guys want my
productive morning routine I sleep on
the top bunk and so it's actually really
cozy up here as soon as I wake up in the
morning I like to go and make my bed
just because it like totally changes my
day whatever this is made first this has
to happen or else like the whole day
was gonna go ahead and open up this
curtain - because I just hit letting in
natural light in the morning just lets
like your whole body wake up and even
those days are really cloudy not so
pretty day I'm still so thankful to live
in New York City
they go ahead and put on my glasses too
which are real because I literally can't
see his head on over into the kitchen
which is like two steps over and
literally the first thing I do in the
morning is make coffee because I need
coffee in the morning guys
I've actually been using instant coffee
which I know sounds really scary but I
really like it it's like tastes really
good this is just the Medaglia d'Oro
coffee and boil some water while I wait
for that to boil I like to actually
start reading my Bible in the morning I
think it's really important for me
personally to start my day with reading
the Bible it really changes my whole day
and I'm gonna be honest it's something
that I try to do every day but
especially on Mondays and Thursdays just
because I don't have class so I don't
want class till 1:30 like there's no
point and skipping that so I'm gonna go
ahead and read some mornings I will just
read straight from the Bible and then
some mornings I will actually listen to
a podcast and if I listen to a podcast I
either listen to Matt Chandler or the
porch and I think this morning I might
actually listen to a podcast
so my coffees done so I'm going to go
ahead and pour this into my instant
coffee guide we know down below if you
drink coffee what kind of coffee you
prefer whether that be like Keurig
French press a normal pot coffee I'm
interested because I'm a coffee girl so
after I'm done with my coffee I like to
come in here and make some breakfast and
so usually my breakfast changes all the
time it's usually either overnight oats
granola and fruit avocado toast or
smoothie Bowl and this morning I have
just like been really lacking fruit
lately so I'm gonna have a smoothie Bowl
parsnip I would have is if you like your
smoothie bowls more like tangy tried to
use tea instead I use pomegranate
raspberry tea instead of using almond
milk and it makes it a lot more like
fruity I just think it tastes good if
you want to switch it up pour this into
a bowl usually cut into hard there we go
for toppings I don't like to go like
super crazy you see just add a little
bit of shredded coconut and then also
just a little bit of granola this is
just the Trader Joe's coconut cranberry
granola and you have every you me
breakfast
so while you're eating I wanted to talk
about why I think mornings are so
important College it's so easy to give
yourself up to so many different things
in terms of like your relationship your
schoolwork internships jobs I've Smitty
bull Mikey you need to have time that's
for yourself and whether it be the night
time maybe your really big night Bruce
and whether it be in the morning time
being able to make a healthy breakfast
work on stuff getting a right mind place
and time getting ready those are things
that are really important to me try to
wake up early and take time in the
morning to do these things my roommate
also has class on these days and so I
have like the room the apartment to
myself which is just also a bless see I
just finish my bowl and we don't have a
dishwasher so I like to wash everything
right after I use it now I like to get
work done and my work I mean working on
YouTube stuff so like five emails to
answer by ha videos to edit videos to
post today I posted a main channel video
and I also posted a vlog I vlog on my
second channel it's Michelle out of her
shell I try to upload 2 to 3 vlogs a
week and so I've been really consistent
on there you should follow me and I
actually have some eel things to do
today so I think I'm gonna go ahead and
do that CMG
so just finished Guinea work done and
now I'm gonna go ahead and add stuff
into my planner I'm not a huge planner
person I know girls like go crazy over
planners and use stickers and stuff not
really my thing so I just use a black
moleskin planner isn't too much to it
you just have like your days of the week
and then it also has like a note section
which I think it's not today I have
Islamic reading for my Oracle theology
class that I need to go over and then I
had film productive morning routine
which I've already done my case study
and start that right up I think that's
it for stuff that I have to get done
today it's not like a super busy day so
now it's time to get ready because I got
everything done I love getting ready in
the morning I put on makeup basically
every single day for college because at
my school we have a business casual
dress code so it's not just like you
roll out of bed and go to class you like
have to look professional so I just like
to actually like get right I'm not gonna
show you guys what I'm actually doing as
far as makeup because I just posted and
like every day college makeup video so I
just finished my makeup this is about
how much makeup I wear to class normally
and I'm gonna go ahead and go pick out
my outfit today for class I am just
wearing this dress which is from Urban
Outfitters it's definitely like a summer
dress but I paired it with some knit
tights and then also these Naturalizer
booties you basically have to wear like
dresses or skirts or like nice pants and
so this is like stuff that I usually
wave before I head I also always spray
my replica by the fireplace perfume it
is so good I'm also trying to not eat
out and so I think I'm going to pack
myself a nice little lunch buy that I
basically mean frozen veggie patties my
school has a microwave so it's super
easy just like whip things up
about the head out so I hope you guys
