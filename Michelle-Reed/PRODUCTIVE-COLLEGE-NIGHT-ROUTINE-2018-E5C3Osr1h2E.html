this is my productive College night
routine in New York City I'd also like
to thank our as far as for sponsoring
this video so after I get back from
class I like to answer emails just cuz
it's really nice out here I also really
like these are X bars right now if you
guys didn't follow me for a while you
know I love these basically all they
have in them are like three egg white 14
peanuts and two dates and so they don't
have any like extra stuff in them or
anything they also come with eleven
different flavors I particularly like
the peanut butter one it's definitely my
favorite it's a great healthy option if
you are like trying to go on the go I
love using it like in between class and
stuff because it's like super healthy
you don't have to buy like a nasty snack
that has a ton of different crap in it
also gluten free soy free and dairy free
and if you want to check them out I
definitely recommend checking them out
because I genuinely love these I
literally eat these all the time
Aidan can attest I eat them all the time
if you use the code Michelle Reed you
can get 25% off your first order so I
definitely recommend trying it out guys
right now my water is boiling I wanted
to show you guys a little grocery haul
but I picked up tonight I want to try
out a new recipe which is like a salmon
though with like a mustard sauce on it
and so I picked up some things to do
that I also haven't been sleeping well
if you watched my vlog channel I talked
about it so if I had really bad
under-eye circles that is why life just
keeps moving on anyway some spinach we
ran out of olive oil so I don't had to
buy a new one which always hurts because
olive oil is so expensive
Dijon mustard some deals and dental
floss which will make sense later some
cashews and raisins some salmon and also
just some paper towels because we're and
also I'm gonna put this stuff away make
my tea and then change and do some comfy
clothes I'm tired of wearing this New
York today is so cloudy injury so we are
about to turn on some lights in this
room because we got to get productive if
you've been watching for a while you're
probably so confused why my bed is on
the ground cuz it used to be lofted as I
told you guys I've been having trouble
sleeping and so I'm seeing if putting it
down helps my sleep cycle better which
also means that all of this stuff behind
me is in like the middle of the room and
that's just because I live in New York
City in this apartment is tiny and you
can't fit everything and so I'm just
gonna keep it real in this video and be
like yo my apartment is a mess but I
still have to live into my night routine
despite that I like to just kind of put
on some youtube to have in the
background Milan like changing into my
comfy clothes getting ready that kind of
thing you know my subscription box
Christie just uploaded a new video so we
are about to watch it I'm so excited for
my company outfit I just have on this
tank top I think it's from Target also I
burned my shoulder if you're wondering
and I'm also wearing my fabletics
leggings I love these they're like
watercolor I think that they're super
cute I'll have them linked down below if
you want to purchase them I mentioned
them in my workout video which you
should watch but I'm currently really
liking them
the living in New York like can get
really chaotic I recently been dealing
with like a lot of anxiety and so
whenever I come home from class I'd like
to just give myself about 30 minutes to
chill whatever that may be so like today
I'm just gonna sit I'm gonna watch
Christy's video and like chill out and
not do emails I'm not gonna do homework
it's important to let yourself relax
every now and then because if you don't
you're gonna go crazy and the past few
weeks of my life have been that so right
now I'm just teaching my body how to
chill so I'm gonna do that let me know
down below what your favorite thing to
do is to chill out after o'clock getting
a sack watching a video what it is leave
it down below so it's about 5 o'clock
now which means I should probably start
doing my homework and so I'm gonna get
going on a few things for tonight's
homework I have to edit an economics
paper that I wrote earlier but I just
want to make sure it's really good and
then I also have a little bit of reading
that I need to catch up on not a lot of
homework my semesters been a lot not
easier but less work based and so I
don't have like a time to do my sister
Jamie is also coming this weekend so I
want to make sure that I get ahead on
stuff and get stuff done so we can hang
out
sometimes people ask what kind of class
work I do and so I thought I would
describe what this essay isn't I'm
writing this is for my economic thought
and practice class which is required
after school I go to which is the King's
College basically we have to do a
project on a specific economist and kind
of show their ideas and like a creative
form and so this is the rough draft for
the project and doing Bernard Mandeville
who basically said that advice was
necessary for economic growth
crazy controversial thing that kind of
shook the 17th and 18th century I'm
comparing his thoughts to New York City
since New York City you know like luxury
and greed and materialism really can
motivate the economy here and so I'm
comparing the two and I actually really
like economics and so this kind of stuff
like kind of nerds me out because I
think it's really cool
and then reading this handout which is
for my historical theology class I find
this stuff extremely boring you gotta do
it because do your homework kids even
when you don't want to so it's my
favorite time of the night and that is
dinner times I'm about to make up some
dinner
got to go ahead and put on the
handy-dandy apron
so like I said I'm making that salmon
recipe it's actually a recipe that I saw
in a video of a Victoria's Secret model
I was watching her video and I like this
recipe looks so good so I'm gonna go
ahead and make that if you want to make
it I'll have it linked down below
he's in our salmon first with some salt
and pepper and then we're going to add a
little bit of the mustard on to the scam
it's got a little bit of the spinach on
to eat salmon doing a little bit of the
goat cheese on top you get a little
something like this
and then just take the floss and we're
gonna tie it together so it all holds
together which sounds funny but it
worked until it's all wrapped up and
then just adding a little bit more
mustard to the top and then add just a
bit of dill to the top and then pop it
in the oven for 20 minutes and so now
I'm gonna cook up a little bit of
spinach to get some vegetables in it
just taking my spinach and then also
these cashews and raisins to put in and
I'm just gonna put a little bit of olive
oil in the pan and then start cooking
click off the salmon and it looks good
guys and that is it for my dinner guys
that is so good guys you need to make
this I also live and technically like
the dorms but they're like apartments
for my school and so we have room checks
and I have our own trucks tomorrow in
this place is a disaster which means I'm
gonna do some cleaning right now
literally blogging myself cleaning my
toilet I tell you know I keep it real
over here guys
so I finished cleaning and I got out of
the shower but I wanted to really
quickly just go through my current
skincare routine for you guys besides
obviously the really dark circles I have
really like curated a skincare routine
that works I use the low pH
COEs rx cleanser I love this cleanser
it's really simple and then I forgot I
like to use my nature republic snail
solution I also have some time so I'm
whipping on a face mask this is the so
AE nature collagen essence matte and
then I just leave this on for about 30
minutes or so going ahead and taking
this off from oyster Iser I am using the
nature of public snail solution
moisturizer I also like the self tan my
face I use this a Tropez face
self-tanner I love this stuff so like I
said I've been having trouble sleeping
lately I don't know why so before I go
to bed I always like to read some of
this book that my sister-in-law gave me
it's called the inner voice of love by
Henri new in its really calming to my
soul I hope you guys enjoyed watching
