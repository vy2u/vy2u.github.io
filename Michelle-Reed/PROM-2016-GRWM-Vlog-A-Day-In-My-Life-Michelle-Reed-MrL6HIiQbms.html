day in my life
prom video sorry it's kind of windy I
usually fill in these kind of videos on
my vlog channel which is Michelle out of
her shell if you're wondering but I know
I feel like I just kind of wanted to put
this up on my main channel so I'm gonna
take you guys along with me and they get
ready with me process and then I'm going
to take you guys to the actual prom kind
of show you guys how it goes down and
all that fun stuff I just fainted my
nails and I hate painting my nails
because this always happens literally
every time because painting my toenails
sorry if you think feet are gross it's
my self tanner
so I'm looking kind of brown trust me
this will fade I am doing my own makeup
just because I honestly like doing my
own makeup I think it's really fun doing
formal makeup so I'm going to do like a
rose gold look and then I'm getting my
hair done because I can't do hair for
the life of me but I'm just doing kind
of like a messy updo I also don't think
I've shown you guys my dress yet it just
looks like this so it's really really
plain and then the back is pretty much
completely open so it's honestly really
simple but it's really comfortable but
I'm gonna go to my friend Rose's house
and kind of hang out with her for an
hour and then I'll probably start doing
my makeup because my hair appointment is
that 3:15 it's like 10 o'clock right now
just got to roses hey like your pants
roses gonna help me do it
hopefully yeah I'm gonna need it flying
so good yes that's what I'm saying
everybody in here deep dunk by Ginobili
waiting to luck
after prom most kids are going to be
partying and rose and I will be kicking
off today getting waffles
so yeah that's right when Rose is a
homey and look to borrow her face primer
true friends guys
I just got back from roses right now
it's about 12:30 and I'm doing my friend
Meghan's eyeshadow today and so she's
going to come over at 1:00 and then I'll
probably start doing my makeup after I
do that these are all of the products
that I plan on using or just like I want
to have out the guys look at this I set
out all of my eyeshadow palettes that
I'm thinking of using this is insane I'm
going to use this eye shadow which is
honestly just the coolest stuff these
are the Stila magnificent metal eyes
eyeshadows this one is a metallic dusty
rose and it's this prettiest shimmery
almost just looks like literally like
you put metallic dust on your face but I
think I want to wear this on my lids
because it's so pretty I'm watching
Keaton Milburn right now who if you
haven't checked out her channel
definitely check her out she's awesome
and I love your videos
I just finished eye makeup and I really
really like how it came out it's not
very rose-gold at all it's actually like
pretty purpley um but I think it looks
pretty I cannot get over how much I love
these Sparkle eyeshadows guys seriously
get these they are incredible and they
just look so pretty oh nice so it's 2:30
right now and so I need to go to my hair
appointment at 3:15 so I'll probably
leave it like 2:45 to go there I set out
all the outfit details here's like a
better view of my dress full body
obsessed with this clutch Roxy has been
following me around all day because
she's bored
I'm sorry Roxy so I just got home and
this is what my hair looks like I really
really like it it's super just kind of
like messy and throwing together I
really really like it and I also put on
my dress for you guys so this is what my
dress looks like so here is the full
