where we accidentally sleep in for an
hour so today I'll be showing you how to
go from this to this with this super
cute easy top knot bun without any heat
at all it's also super easy so you won't
end up throwing random stuff around your
room tease the first step is just taking
a brush in teasing your hair which I
know isn't very good but I'm only
released about once a week so it's not
too bad this is going to give the button
volume thi take a hair tie and put your
hair in a high ponytail just wherever
you want your bun to be I won't mind to
be high and then I'm tying it through
taking another hair tie I'm going to be
wrapping the hair around the base of the
ponytail and securing it so I'll go once
and then again and then sometimes I just
like to take another hair tie and fold
over the hair and tie it again until I
like the way that the bun turns out and
then I just kind of like to pull some
pieces around and pull the wispies out
from the front pin taking some bobby
pins I'm just gonna pin back any pieces
that I don't want so just pinning back
any weird awkward hairs hair spray now
i'm just using hairspray and spraying it
all throughout my hair then i just like
to kind of comb it out with my fingers
getting it all voluminous and whatnot
and messy so yeah that's the end of this
video and i hope you all enjoyed and
i'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
