all how to get this really pretty bright
the low E and pretty spring makeup
tutorial so yeah let's just go ahead and
get started so first I'm just taking my
covergirl nature Lux foundation and
applying that to my face and then
blending it in with an elf flat top
brush and then i'm taking my instant age
rewind concealer applying this to my
dark circles and to any blemishes that i
have on my face at the moment and then
I'm just blending it out with my finger
next I'm taking my Revlon Photoready
powdered I'm just going to set all that
so it stays throughout the day so I'm
just dusting that across my face and
taking my NYX cream blush in boho chic
flying that to my cheekbones for a nice
little glow and then i'm taking my
clinic blush in iced lotus and i'm going
to apply that over just to set the cream
blush because it's kind of a creamy
blush and then i'm just taking my NYX
jumbo eye shadow pencil and white and
I'm going to put this on my eyelid so
the eye shadow shows up a little bit
better and then I'm taking my NYX jumbo
eye shadow pencil in strawberry milk and
I'm going to apply this to the outer
corner of my eye and then blending it in
with my finger for a nice pink color and
then i'm taking my Maybelline eye studio
and barely branded I'm just applying
this to the inner half of my eye also
the inner corner to brighten it up and
then taking my naked palette in using
the color sin which is a nice peachy
color and then apply this on to the pink
cream eyeshadow that I applied earlier
and then to get my naked Urban Decay
basics palette i'm going to take venus
and i'm going to put this on the
shimmery color that i applied in the
inner half and inner corner of my eye
now i'm taking my urban decay basics and
using naked too and i'm putting this in
the crease to give us a little bit of
definition and using side card from my
naked palette i'm putting this in the
very outer corner of my eye so yeah
that's the end of the eyeshadow so now
I'm just taking my ELF cream eyeliner
which I cannot do for the life of me on
camera so I did it but I just winged it
out a little bit and then curl my
eyelashes and apply to my rocket mascara
from Maybelline so I just did a couple
coats of that skim I as some nice length
I guess so you have at the end of the
eyeshadow in for lips I'm just taking my
Revlon lip butter and raspberry pi and
applying this to my lips for a nice
bright bold color and over top of that
i'm using my one size fits pearl color
whisper on top just for some shimmer and
shine so yeah that's the end of this
video and i hope you all enjoyed if you
