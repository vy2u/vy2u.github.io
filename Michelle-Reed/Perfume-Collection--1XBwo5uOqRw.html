video today just because i thought so
you guys may be interested in it in this
video I'm going to try to not look in
the viewfinder that's my goal it's my
goal I guess somebody commented said it
was annoying so I'm gonna flip it around
actually okay I'm sorry I have to show
us around so I'm gonna go ahead and get
started so this is what I keep all over
fumes on it's just silver tray and I was
really dirty I just keep all my perfumes
and body splashes on it you can't buy it
anymore so I'm hair it's actually one
another golf list but I'm gonna pursue
I'm gonna start off with perfumed Spurs
my favorite Holy Grail I love it this is
Viva La Juicy it looks so cute house
like the pink bow in all this and it
smells like um kind of free but at the
same time kind of Italy gosh spicy what
I use is pretty much every day and i
love it and i have warm vanilla sugar
and bath and body work this is just
pretty sure everybody's kind of spelt
this it just smells kinda just smells
like a bakery or something and then i
have so booked on carmella from benefit
just looks like this um this one is
really good for fall it smells like kind
of cozy like caramel hence the name so
hooked on carmella you can't already I'm
much into the like warm vanilla cozy
sense versus like fruity floral kind of
tones and I have this one which Evelyn
gave to me a long time ago it's called
pink like here
that's what the label looks like so I
don't really know what this is I
honestly never uses cuz smells really
bad to tell you the truth like old lady
perfume didn't have a few little mini
perfumes the first one is clinics happy
actually just got this and like a little
sample bonus thing just makes you so
happy it's very like kind of citrusy I
think it has an orange in it this is
really the only like true fruity scent
that I'll wear it just cuz it makes me
happy when skies are gray then I have
this ed hardy one which I don't even
think has any left have the peace love
and Juicy Couture rollerball which just
smells kind of floral so I have a few
body splashes i'm going to show you guys
i'll start off with the bath and
Bodyworks ones i've carried away which
my friend katie actually gave to me um
nice never smell these yeah smells very
fruity the whole thing just fell oh my
gosh those basically the biggest fail
ever had but back to what i was saying i
have the winter candy apple which I love
this in especially since it's getting to
winter i adorn it a caramel apple makes
with sugar I know car waffles do have
sugar but like a little bit more sugar
and then I have coconut lime breeze i
bought this for three dollars on sale I
smokin very summery sin so I don't
really wear this too much right now the
last 1i have is twilight woods this was
like fruity but kind of musky same time
the last three that I have are all from
victoria secret pink Vanilla's dream on
for Hume and I really like this one it's
like totally vanilla I actually bought
this cuz strawberryelectric 48 what was
it this and I have pink with a splash of
pretty and pure look how much I've used
of this it's very clean scent so
whenever you just not feeling like much
just like so what's something like this
is really really great and then last one
I have is the pink with a splash of soft
and dreamy as like the blue cap and it
smells kind of similar to this but I
feel like this one's more summery and
this one's more like fall and winter so
