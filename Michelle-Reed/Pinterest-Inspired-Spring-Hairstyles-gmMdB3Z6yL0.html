this one looks pretty easy yeah why not
so you twist here and then bend here and
then leave it on your fingers here and
oh another pincers fail no worries I got
you covered
hi friends today I'm going to be doing a
very exciting video and it's going to be
a Pinterest inspires spring hair
tutorial kind of thing I always go on
pinterest and I see these super cute
hairstyles but I can never figure out
how to do them because they're so
difficult so I pics them easier once to
do including this lovely fish tail up to
and I'm going to be showing you guys
five of my favorites I also got to work
with Garnier on this video which is
super exciting because it's such a cool
brand that I kind of used all my life so
if you try out any of these hairstyles
and make sure to tweet me a picture on
Twitter or post on Instagram and I'll
probably follow you like your picture
and you can have a nice little chat
let's just go ahead and get to the video
so here style number one is a voluminous
side fishtail I already washed my hair
with my full and plus shampoo and
conditioner this gives me a ton of
volume and then i used the roots pump
spray and this really gets the top of my
hair very voluminous and it rocks let me
tell you and then for the ends of my
hair i put in this full and plush kind
of gel and this really thickens up your
hair then I just blow dried my hair and
i tilted it upside down because yet
again this gives you a lot more volume
then I used my texture T spray I love
this because it really makes the
hairstyles hold so first I just put my
hair into a half-up half-down style and
I teased it and then secured it with a
an elastic then I just section the hair
into two pieces and did a fishtail so
you basically just bring a section
across the other side I'll have a video
link down below more in depth then you
just kind of spread your hair apart and
loosen it up and loosen the top as well
and pull out some pieces and that's it
for this hairstyle
this X hairstyle is a fishtail braid I
love this one so all you're going to
need is a hair ties and you're just
gonna have to put your hair up in a
ponytail this ad it's just it then you
just split your hair into two and do a
fishtail braid and you definitely want
to make sure you're doing this down the
middle and not to the side or also
you're going to eat kind of a weird
spinny fishtail then I like to kind of
loop a piece around elastic and this
creates a kind of bow look it's a little
bit difficult but it looks really cool
it looks like this right here and that
is it for this hairstyle probably one of
the easiest next we are doing a fishtail
up do this one is definitely my favorite
so all you do is part your hair in the
middle and then you take two of the
sections and do fishtail braids pretty
tight I would say and then you'll loosen
them up at the end and then just secure
them with clear elastics now I did one
without a mirror and one with so you can
definitely tell the difference is pretty
bad but then I'm just loosening up the
braids a lot and to move them over I
twist the hair and then I pull it over
this kind of prevents your hair from
getting weird in the front so I do this
to both strands of hair and then
sometimes doing it kind of weird lumps
in the front so just pin these down
because I think it looks better when
your ears are showing and pull out some
hair and there you have it a super cute
updo this next hairstyle is a super high
voluminous bun all you do is put your
hair up like you're doing a ponytail and
then wrap the hair around the base of
the bun and then take your hair tie and
put it around once around the bun and
then I like to pull the hair across the
other side if this makes sense and then
secure it so you kind of get this
seashell like shape but um it's my
favorite technique to doing hi buns
because they're super messy then just
secure it and you can add a cute
headband like I did I think this looks
very springy and that's pretty much it
our last hairstyle is just a very simple
kind of double braid look all you do is
put your hair into a little part and
grab a section from the top and you're
basically doing a braid where you braid
and then take a piece from the inside
put it under the middle and then take a
piece from the outside I know there's a
name for this brave but i'm not sure
what it is it may be a dutch I don't
really know may not be anything at all
but then once you get to where you can't
grab any more hair just braid normally
until you get to the middle of the back
of your head and then you just pin it I
think this is a lot easier than French
braiding your hair and it's super cute
so I really hope you guys like this look
so I really really hope you guys enjoyed
this video I had so much fun creating it
I love these hairstyles I do them all
the time because they are great again
