upside you're just warned I was gonna
fall still be yours move along Shore
star so bright niggas good hello
everybody I just wanted to quickly
explain what this video is that you're
about to watch basically these are the
things that I do from the morning to the
nighttime that helped me for you
productive so it's just one of those
days where I'm like crap I have a lot of
stuff to do and so I will kind of change
my routine to be able to complete
everything that I need to like always if
you happen to just stumble across this
video you don't know who the heck I am
you should definitely subscribe right
now the buttons right there my name is
Michelle Reed and I film a lot of cool
content on here I'd really love for you
to subscribe and yeah let's just go
ahead and get into my morning to night
routine a productive day tips so right
when you wake up in the morning instead
of going straight to Instagram and
Twitter try putting your phone away and
just giving yourself about five minutes
to stretch and just think and get your
mind going it's so much better than
going straight on your electronics and
it'll benefit you and the rest of the
day I then like to go in the bathroom
and cleanse my skin because it wakes me
up I absolutely love my spin for perfect
skin brush I love this thing because it
comes with a body brush a cleansing
brush and an exfoliating brush which is
great for just clearing out all of your
pores and waking you up in the morning I
love it it also comes with a Punic stone
which is great for getting softer feet
all you have to do is insert for
double-a batteries and then it spins
using rotary action which is awesome and
has a ton of really fun colors so it's
like a Clarisonic but a lot cheaper
because I have a discount code which
gets you 70% off which is EXO Michelle
so check it out I'll have it linked down
below but it's definitely an essential
to starting my day
I then go straight to the kitchen and I
make a very nourishing breakfast
I love having oatmeal this is like the
only brand of oatmeal that I like but
it's so so yummy and it tastes good and
it's really important to just carb up so
you have enough energy for the rest of
the day instead of just eating like a
granola bar I didn't like to make a list
instead of going on my phone while
eating my breakfast just so I could jot
a few things down I'm not super into
planning out every single move but I do
think it's important to write down the
main tasks that you need to complete and
then when it comes to my to-do list I
like to do all of the hardest tasks
first just because after breakfast you
have the most energy you're fresh you're
awake whereas when it comes to be like 4
o'clock you're more tired and you're not
going to want to do those hard things so
start off by doing all the things that
you don't want to do first so in the end
it makes up for it it's also important
to unplug so put your phone in your
computer as far away as possible I
promise if you don't go on Instagram for
an hour you will not miss anything
people like to say their lives are a lot
cooler than they are I also have another
task that I love and it's basically
doing everything that I can under two
minutes right then and there so instead
of just throwing my jacket on the floor
I will go hang it out because this will
save me so much time in the long run and
honestly everyone enjoys saving time so
do it when it gets to be about 4 o'clock
and you can feel yourself losing energy
try working out I always work out at
around 4 or 5 because it gives me an
instant boost it's kind of like coffee
you automatically feel like you can
complete your tasks and so this is so
important to me it's probably the most
important thing to me and I also have my
workout routine linked down below if you
want to check it out
then I would say to go to sleep earlier
I know it's easier said than done but
you want to make sure that you're ready
to take on the next day so give yourself
plenty of time to sleep I really really
hope you guys enjoyed watching this
video I think it's really important that
we be productive when we get things done
let me know down below what's one thing
you do to be productive so if it is one
of those days where you gotta get a lot
of stuff done let me know know what
helps you because I'm always up for
learning new things you should also go
watch my last video it was about 5 easy
ways to get clear skin so if your start
with acne definitely give that video a
view and I'll see you guys my next one
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
