regret buying video I just wanted to sit
down and feel like a traditional beauty
video I guess and over the years that i
have bought products and beauty products
and all that kind of stuff i have
accumulated some that i don't really
like so i wanna start off could make a
product i have them all in this little
bag there's not too many but there's a
few i'm going to start off with lip
products the first one is these elf
conditioning lip balms now the lip balm
itself is amazing it's awesome it's like
three dollars so it's not like it's
really expensive they smell so good they
smell like coconut and they're just like
amazing but the thing is I don't like
these colors I have another one that's
like peaceful pink or something that's
really good so the first one is mellow
melon and it looks like this it's like a
coral ish color and I'll swatch it for
you guys it looks like that so there's
some really good color payoff but this
just makes my lips look like sucked on a
popsicle or something i don't really
like that look so i don't really like
this color and then I'm nice and natural
which I was really excited for this
color but it's just not good it looks
like this it's a really pretty nude
color when you actually likes watch it
it makes me look dead makes me look like
a dead person and I don't want to look
dead I want to look alive so next I have
one of these Revlon just bitten kissable
balm stain in the color char I'm not
sure about all the colors but I really
don't like this like this is so bad so
in the tube it looks really pretty like
and then when you swatch it looks really
pretty as well right there but over time
once it turns into a stain it changes
into like this reddish orange not coral
orange on your lips and it settles in
all like the cracks and stuff and it
looks so bad I wear this in my lookbook
yesterday and I like looked in the car
mirror i was like 'i 'e what do my lips
look orange it was so gross and I was
talking to Sophie and she has this and
she's like yeah it did the exact same
thing to me so I don't know I don't know
if they're all bad or if it's just this
color or what but don't get this my last
lip product is one of these a lorio
color
reach lipsticks now these are so bad
they smell like old perfume you know
like that grandma perfumey cosmetic
smell the smells so gross so this is in
the color British Red don't judge i had
to get this for like a play or something
feel like nasty and stuff and now i just
use this to write on my mirror for face
products i have to first one you may be
kind of surprised about it's the benefit
that gal brightening face primer looks
like that now this is just a little
sample size but honestly i hate this um
it comes out pink on your hand and when
you blend it in it just really gives my
face like this red tint and I feel like
it really makes icing my skin look more
oily and shiny and I just don't like it
you have like combination or oily skin
do not get this the second product is
the elk tinted moisturizer in the shade
porcelain now this is only three dollars
so this isn't something that I'm like
totally disappointed about I mean first
off it's really messy as you can see
right there like look at all that not
fun to put on in the card so the shape
porcelain is very yellow tone i will
show you guys like its I don't you can't
even tell but it's like very yellowy
orange II it just doesn't look good it's
not terrible it's just not good so I
don't know and lastly I have to I
products the first one is the Avalon
cream shadows and the shade not just
nudes they look so pretty and they look
like this thing kind of like about these
is they crease you do have to use a
primer or else they will crease like
crazy and they still crease with a
primer for me I just feel like they're
not very good cream eyeshadows you can
find better ones the color tattoo by
Maybelline are way better and I'm pretty
sure they're like around the same price
is this the last makeup product i have
is the elf eyelid primer and the
champagne now this was only a dollar so
it's not like I spent all of my money on
this but still I bought it and I wanted
it to be good and it's not it's in the
shade champagne now Tommy do you guys
think this is champagne first off that
looks like a bronzy purple you should
name is bronze and then when i swatched
it i was like how in the world is this
champagne this purple and silver glitter
not shimmer glitter why is it purple
I've never used this honestly because
it's purple and I don't wear purple
eyeshadow and then I have one skincare
product this is the clinic all about
eyes serum looks like this my sister
actually bought this and she doesn't
like it either so I figured I put this
in but basically it's just one of these
little rollerball things it looks like
that pretty sure you've all seen them
put it under your eyes it's supposed to
help your dark like under eye circles
this stuff I don't know I just feel like
it doesn't do anything if it does
anything it's making my dark circles
look worse I think feels really cool and
your eyes it feels really cooling and
nice but so yeah okay guys so I kind of
forgot where I was because I just went
eight a lunch the last product i have is
a shampoo this is the banging de terre
green meadow balancing shampoo it looks
like this and the reason I've you so
much it's my sister likes this I don't
like it I don't know why she likes it
because we use like the same shampoo and
conditioner so should be sure bathroom
it just really dries out my hair and it
makes my roots feel really weird like in
nasty I have the conditioner too and I
don't like it either I feel like it just
doesn't moisturize so you can see it's a
really liquidy shampoo so I wouldn't
recommend this that was everything for
my products I regret buying okay i don't
know i'm doing i hope you guys enjoyed
this i also want to say if you like any
of these products and that is great they
just didn't work for me they may work
for you i don't really know i hope you
guys like my videos i've been posting
lately and i will see you guys my next
video Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
