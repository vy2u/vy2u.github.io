carry on you're gonna shot so many
bodies on the floor so hello everybody
I'm super stoked for this video today
because it is my prom hair makeup and
dress video for 2016 I show you guys how
to do this super pretty very Universal
neutral makeup look and up to that it's
great for getting your hair out of your
face so you can have fun and then also I
show you guys one of the dresses that I
will be wearing to one of my formal
events this year every day in my channel
you should definitely subscribe the
button will be down below and also right
here you should definitely just stay and
watch my videos that would mean a lot to
me and if you happen to try all this
makeup look or this hair look for prom
or a formal event definitely send me
pictures on Twitter and Instagram
because I'd love to see them and follow
you guys and like your pictures it would
just mean so much to me so that's pretty
much everything that I have to say so
let's just go ahead and get right into
the makeup look so I'm starting off by
using my ultra Repair lotion from first
aid Beauty I love this moisturizer and
it's great because it preps your skin
before makeup and then I'm using my
Smashbox photo finish primer so my skin
looks flawless in pictures and it preps
it for makeup and lastly I'm finishing
off with my primer water just to kind of
lock everything in and it's really ready
for me so I'm using my balletto airbrush
system which I love it gives the most
flawless finish ever I love it so I'm
using the shade bisque and basically I
just put a few drops in the spray
machine and then I spray my face and
circular motion it looks so natural yet
flawless because it is just a nice
airbrushed look so I'll have it linked
down below but I love the system and I
use it for all of my formal events
for brows I'm using my Anastasia brow
pencil and I basically fill in my arch
with this but I don't fill in the front
of my eyebrows yet then I go in with the
eye shadow naked from my Naked palette
and I basically just go with short
little swipes and I go into the inner
part of my brows then I just go in and
clean up with some concealer and my
Beauty Blender to prep for eyeshadow I'm
applying my bowing concealer from
benefit to my eyelids just to kind of
neutralize everything else and then I
make sure to set that with translucent
powder I'm also using this cream shadow
in the shade bold gold just to prepare
for the shimmery eyeshadows and make
them pop in my Urban Decay's smoky
palette I'm taking the shade combust and
I'm applying this to my crease just kind
of making that transition shade and then
I'm going in with whiskey and I'm
applying this to the outer crease to
define things a little bit more then I'm
just wetting my brush I'm applying the
shade high to my eyelid I really really
want this shimmery champagne shade to
stick out and so I'm really really
packing it on and making sure the brush
is wet so it intensifies the color and
then I'm going in with the shade of
black market and I'm applying this to
the outer corner this really just sets
the look off and I love how it looks and
then I blend it out then I just go over
that color again with creep from my
Naked palette then I'm just highlighting
under my brows with the shade 13 which
is a really pretty cream shade now I'm
going to bake my concealer so I'm going
in with my instant age rewind brightener
and I'm applying this under my eyes and
kind of a V motion
to clean up the eye shadow I'm applying
it to the tip of my nose my forehead and
my chin and then I just blend that out
with my Beauty Blender and then I take a
powder I'm using this botanics one from
Boots and I'm basically putting a ton of
that on with my wet Beauty Blender and I
let that sit for 10 minutes to let the
concealer bake you've all probably seen
this before then I wipe off all the
excess powder and you're left with a
really pretty naturally flawless look
that looks great in pictures I'm
contouring with my hoola bronzer I
really really love this bronzer it's my
staple and then I'm going in with this
blush in sunset glow from Clinique and
I'm applying this to my cheekbones
was a really really prettiest shimmery
looked your cheekbones and I love it and
then I'm just highlighting with Max soft
and gentle this really picks up in
pictures so it's great for prom then I'm
mixing whiskey and black market I'm
applying this underneath my lash line
this really just kind of intensifies the
look and then I smudge to some gel
eyeliner on my top line and I applied
some very natural fake eyelashes which
you can just use whatever you want and
then I'm applying my rocket mascara I
love this mascara it's my go-to then I'm
using the shade 14 from Rimmel and I'm
applying this as a base for my lipstick
and then I'm going in with my revlon
ultra matte lip color in the shade
seduction I'm applying that over top in
your left with the prettiest nude look I
just sprayed on some more of that primer
water to give it less of a powdery look
and that's the makeup look
so for here we are doing it up do
because I love updos for formal events
I'm basically just starting off by
curling my hair I like to hairspray it
before so it holds in the curl I'm using
my Bombay one inch wide I'm just running
this through my hair not really thinking
too much about it just so the updo has
some texture if you have curly hair you
can totally just skip this part so
basically I am taking the roots of my
hair and I'm teasing them to give the
updo some more volume and then I'm doing
a Dutch braid in the front of my hair so
I basically just go over each piece and
I make sure to put them underneath and
the thought makes sense and then you
grab a section I'll have a more in depth
video link down below then I'm just
pulling apart the piece twice and then
I'm securing it and then I twist the
hair from each sides of my hair and I
just kind of loosen it and then I pin it
back so I twist and I loosen and then I
pin until all of my hair is back in
somewhat of an updo then I go back and I
secure all the pieces and I honestly
don't think too much about it I just do
it because I really like the messy look
and then I just pinned it back the braid
underneath and tried to hide it best
that I could
hair sprayed it and that is it for the
updo it stays all night and it's super
pretty and simple
so obviously everyone's taste and
dresses are gonna vary but this is one
that I love it's from the brand tony
bowls and I'm wearing it to one of my
events this year it's so pretty and
classy and I am obsessed with the
mermaid style
I love the neutral white and gold colors
I just think they're so pretty and it
looks great with the hair and makeup and
that's it for my prom look so at the end
of this video I really hope you guys
enjoyed watching this and got some
inspiration for your prom or your formal
event or whatever you may be going to
promise so much fun and I feel like
having a good makeup look and a good
hair look just makes the night all much
more fun so hope you guys like this if
you want a more natural everyday look
definitely go watch my last video was a
fresh and youthful makeup tutorial and
it's pretty much everything that I have
to say so hope you guys enjoyed this you
