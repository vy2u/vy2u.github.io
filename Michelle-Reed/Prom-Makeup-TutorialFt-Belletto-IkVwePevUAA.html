how to get this beautiful prom makeup
using the balletto airbrush system I
will also show you all the outfit that I
wore to my drill team banquet so I hope
you all enjoy so first I'm just putting
my hair back in a headband and i'm going
to plug in my system and turn it on high
and using the luster drops which is
basically just moisturizer i'm going to
put a few drops it and the more you pull
back the trigger the more product that's
going to come out of the airbrush system
and so I'm just spraying this across my
face really like these luster drops
because they give my face a nice
moisturize feel so now i'm taking creme
de la which is my shade it's also like
the lightest one and i'm just going to
put a few drops in and what i like to do
is spray in circular motions don't go
and put a lot all at once it's better to
layer so I'm just layering it across my
face I did another layer as I said and
I'm going in circular motions really
like airbrush make it because it stays
on a lot longer and it looks really
really good in pictures I'm just putting
this all across my face and taking my
instant age rewind concealer and I'm
just going to apply this under to my
dark circles because relax those dark
circles the other look awake so I'm just
applying that all over my eyes and then
taking my Revlon Photoready powder
because I'm gonna be taking pictures and
I'm just going to dust this across my
face you don't have to set airbrush
makeup but I just like to because I
pretty oily skin so now I'm turning it
on low cuz I'm gonna be doing blush so
I'm taking a bear blossom blush and I'm
going to be putting just three drops in
that's it you don't need any more blush
is a little tricky but you can kind of
get used to it so I'm just putting it
across the tops of my cheekbones also to
the apples of my cheeks and really just
focusing it in getting it nice and
good I really like airbrush blush
because it stays on a lot longer than
regular blush so I'm taking my elf
eyebrow kit in an angled brush and I'm
just gonna fill in my brows because I
didn't get them waxed don't tell nobody
so I'm just gonna fill them in and I
like to take a little spoolie brush
think that's what they call it and just
comb out my brows now i'm taking my
color tattoo and barely branded which is
just a nice shimmery color and i'm
putting that across my lids and i'm
taking my naked palette i'm gonna be
mixing sin and champagne from covergirl
and putting that all across my lid just
to give a nice shimmery look now taking
my basics palette i'm gonna be taking
naked 2 and putting that in the crease
lightly then I just kind of mixed a lot
of dark brown said I had in this palette
and like sidecar and dark horse and
putting that in the outer corner of my
eye kind of in the outer V and really
blending it out so doesn't look too
harsh but you want it to be a little
harsh because you know it's prom and I'm
taking creep and just putting that on
the very very outer corner ously I'm
just taking Venus and I'm going to be
putting that in the inner corner of my
eye to give my eyes a nice highlight and
i'm taking my covergirl eyeliner which I
can't do on camera but I just line my
eyes and then curl my lashes which again
I can't do oh I'm camera very well and
applied my rocket mascara you can apply
false eyelashes if you want but I just
didn't really want to because I'm not
too good at it for lips I take you my
Revlon lip color in sky pink it's matt
and i love this shade it's a nice to do
peak shut out to jamie for buying this
for me the day on my banquet she's
awesome and so i'm just putting this
across my lips and blending it out and
yeah
so that is the whole makeup tutorial
make sure to check the down bar for some
stuff about balletto to get your own
balletto system sixty percent off with
the code so for my dress I wore a Jovani
dress and it's just black and it has
silver beading across the back my shoes
were from dillards they're just silver
really classy and then I had a clutch
from dulce oh so that at the end of this
and I hope you all enjoy and here's some
pictures my victim you let me see the
parts of you don't worry all that thing
every touch fixed boom now you've been
talking me you're safe Oh things you
never say to me Oh tell me that you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
