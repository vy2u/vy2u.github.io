where she recently posted about
questions that she's ever answered kind
of questions she was scared to answer
and that got me thinking that I felt so
much closer to her after I watched that
video so I was like you know what I'm
gonna do the same exact thing I asked
for questions on my Instagram of things
that I have never answered before things
that like you kind of wouldn't normally
ask but I asked on instagram my
interview at name is that which I'll
read if you want to be in one of my next
one you're new to my channel my name is
Michelle Reid I make beauty fashion
lifestyle College videos a lot of
different stuff and I like to give it
personal and I like to talk about things
that people don't really talk about so
that's what I'm doing today in this
video what is something you did in your
last relationship that you're not doing
in your current relationship I thought
that this was such a good question
because often times when we think about
relationships we think we have a lot of
regret so we're like oh my gosh II can't
even believe I did that I can't even
believe that was the phase of my life at
the end of the day I think you be in
relationships because you're trying to
get to an end goal and the best way
possible and you're meant to like learn
stuff and so I thought it's so cool
someone asked this because I was like yo
there are so many things that I wish I
wouldn't have done in that relationship
that now I don't do because of it only
go to two long-term relationships I was
in one for 3 years in high school and
now I've been in one for about a year
and a half in college my parents have
always been kind of like low-key and
really trusted us in terms of like what
we did with their boyfriends even some
in high school like they knew we didn't
party they knew we didn't drink and so
they definitely keep a lot of tabs on us
but I used to hang out with my boyfriend
a lot in my room and I would like close
the door often and it's not be guys like
my parents like never really did
anything that I necessarily regret but
it's just the aspect of like we were and
Myro hanging out together my boyfriend
Ethan and I we don't spend time with
each other in each other's apartments
like 98% of the time we are out doing
stuff we never hang out one-on-one
inside each other's apartments and
that's just because that is the place
for temptation and I find that whenever
we are hanging out like outside of my
room if you guys are new to my channel
you probably don't know but I'm saving
myself for marriage so that's something
that's really important to me I'm not
saying is important to everyone it
doesn't have to be this is just how I'm
doing things here in my life yeah we
don't ever hang out each other's
apartments and I think a lot of people
might see that
like that's crazy you're like 20 years
old and you can't like hang out in each
other's apartments and I'm like yeah
we're 20 years old and we're children
and sometimes we do things that we
regret so we're just gonna make sure
that we have the proper boundaries in
place I think it is probably one of the
most attractive things when someone can
be like I am too weak that I can't
resist doing this thing and so I'm gonna
put boundaries in place so that I don't
do those things like when someone admits
that they are fallen human being as we
all are and that they don't have it
together and that they need help in this
area that is like so attractive and
that's something that I personally like
really really dig so that's what we do
have you ever had any conflict with a
close friend family member and how does
that affect you and how do you deal with
that so in terms of like conflict I'm
not someone who likes conflict I've run
away from conflict which is a really bad
thing and you shouldn't ever do you
should always confront things that
bother you whatever they're on a smaller
level because they do get bigger
listening to a lot of Jordan Peterson
lately who my boyfriend is obsessed with
but he talks about how like if one
little thing bothers you and in your
head you're like this is so stupid this
is such a small thing well if that
bothers you for 10 minutes a day that's
10 minutes times 5 for 5 days and that's
for a whole entire month which is a
whole entire year which ends up being 2%
of your life that you're annoyed by this
thing so if you cut out those small
annoyances whenever they happen I only
really had one major conflict I think
within my family and that was actually
like a couple years ago over the summer
which I'm not like gonna talk about it's
really important to apologize and I
think kind of our culture has lost the
art of apologizing and admitting when
you're wrong that's like as a weakness
when in reality whenever you admit that
you did something wrong that you are
falling again like that is so attractive
I think you respect people so much more
whenever they do that I'm really happy
my parents have always really shown us
and led by example by apologizing
whenever they do things that are wrong
because that's something that like I
want to do ever like I'm in a long-term
relationship if anything I think that
conflict actually helped shape me as a
person and shape my ability to deal with
things and I really look grateful for it
do you ever struggle with social anxiety
if so how do you help yourself
or comment I don't know if it's
necessarily social anxiety but I have
always been a quiet person I've always
been a more introverted person I don't
think I struggled with social anxiety I
have the ability to like keep up
conversation if I need to but I had
dealt with anxiety like literally a
couple months ago whenever I came back
to school I was so stressed because I
had this idea that I was gonna be
filming a lot more I didn't want to fall
off YouTube like I did the previous
semester I wanted to be so good and so I
was working so hard all the time I would
go to sleep and my heart would be
beating so fast every night and it
literally got to the point where I
thought something was wrong with my
heart and so I went to the doctor and
they're like I don't think anything's
wrong but I do think you need to like
chill out and for me I am a
perfectionist I'm never satisfied with
what I do always can be better than how
I do it which is awful and that's such a
bad trap to get in because whenever
you're constantly not satisfied with
yourself while that may seem like you're
being really modest and humble you're
not Jesus tells us that we are made in
His image and we are held so highly so
highly above any other creature so
whenever we deny that and whenever me
saying no I'm not worthy no I'm not good
at this and that is denying like what
Jesus told us that we were so it may
seem like you're being really humble
you're actually denying creation and
you're denying the will of God and
that's a deep-rooted problems I
definitely think is one of my greatest
sins and that's something that I am
always having to come to terms with I
don't think it's ever something I'm
gonna completely conquer so no I haven't
overcome it but how do i reconcile it
daily I'm constantly reading my Bible
I'm constantly constantly looking at
what my worth is in God's eyes they're
specifically a song Psalm 37 that I love
and there's one line and that says that
those who look to him are radiant I
think that's such a strong line and it
also says that they will never be
ashamed so whenever you're feeling
anxiety when you're feeling ashamed
think you're feeling I can't do this you
are radiant when you look to him and
that's what we should be striving to do
do you value your relationship with your
boyfriend because you were waiting until
marriage or in spite of it I'm just
going to be honest this is gonna be
something that people aren't gonna agree
with and that's okay be
able to disagree not be offended is an
important thing and so if you disagree
with this it's totally okay I'm just
letting you guys know my opinion I'm so
attracted to him because he is on the
same page as me in terms of this it
wasn't even something that was like this
giant conflict in our relationship that
we had to talk about and really make
sure it was like at the center like we
just kind of knew it was like you went
into it right we're not gonna do this
and we don't talk about it all the time
we just don't and for me it's so
attractive knowing that not having that
element in our relationship but he still
like pursues me as if like I am
completely everything that he's ever
wanted like that is so attractive that
we don't have to be doing that stuff but
he still loves spending time with me and
loves me as a person and I'm not saying
that if you are I mean sex that like
that's not an element to this is just
like my thought process as a 19 year old
girl I think for him and for me that's
an element of self control and whenever
humans exercise and ability of self
control in an area I think that's so
attractive whether that be like you're
an alcoholic and you don't drink for two
months like how attractive will you be
to that person it would be will not
conquer that you know it's just
something that I think goes a lot deeper
than we think
and I do really really value him because
of that what made you decide to go
vegetarian in the first place and then
pescetarian honestly I'm gonna be like
completely honest it wasn't for ethical
reasons that's not why I started being a
vegetarian or a pescetarian I'm never
really loved to meet so much I grew up
in the south so it's just always
something I was kind of there and like
every single meal but I started not
eating me and I just felt a lot better
and then I started having fish for the
first time and so I started eating fish
and this is just kind of a diet that
works for me only easy to maintain in
college I feel really good whenever I do
it I still feel like I have energy I
still feel like I'm able to like live
life to the fullest and again it kind of
going off that self control thing it's
kind of cool knowing you can go without
something and be totally okay it's
almost a challenge to myself like hey
Michelle can you give up this thing that
you might be kind of dependent on and be
okay and it's like yeah I can't be okay
given the fact that you want to wait
until marriage do you ever sleep in the
same bed as Eden or do you still go to
his place sometime obviously this is a
more personal question no we don't sleep
together no we don't nap together that's
not something that
do even whenever I go over to his place
I don't hardly ever really hang out
there because I just find I enjoy doing
actual things with him rather than like
sitting in this room watching like a
movie we also both have roommates which
is a blessing because it's like you
never really are alone because there's
always people there I think that does
kind of make you anticipate whenever you
will finally be alone together and I
think that just kind of like Spurs a
relationship and gives a good foundation
why aren't you involved in any Christian
organizations and this girl went on to
talk about how many organizations she's
involved in nothing beneficial for her I
actually am involved a little bit I do a
Bible study for my house in my college
because we have like houses of girls and
so I actually co-lead one with one of my
best friends Carson I have been wanting
to get involved other places
specifically I really want to start
volunteering at a failed pregnancy
center which is a crisis pregnancy
center in New York City which has a
Christian founder and is a really really
good program and so I know I'm like
definitely should and it's really really
a bad habit to continually not do those
things and be lazy and not pursue them
and so thank you for calling me out are
you happy that you chose the Kings
College I wanted to talk about this
because I want to emphasize that in life
nothing is ever going to be perfect and
nothing is going to ever go exactly as
you imagined I was definitely more in
love with my school whenever I was about
to go there versus now that they've been
there for a year and a half and I'll
tell you why am i happy that I chose it
yeah I am because I think in life you're
gonna have things that really piss you
off but to Bank it through those things
and still find like a ray of light is
good now obviously if you're extremely
depressed on the situation you're in you
should change it I love the classes at
my school the education that I'm getting
is so great when I look at other
students who are my age who don't know
how to like form an argument and who
don't know how to write my school's
really strict on writing really strict
on grammar I'm like this is why I paying
for this education this and even if I
don't do something that's on this super
narrow business path or my degree just
fits perfectly like I still have basic
skills I'm gonna be honest the social
setting of my school is not like my
absolute favorite I've had people tweet
about my videos I've had people
call me names behind my back my school's
tiny given what I've read people say
about me on the internet I'm like for a
while you have that stuff really
bothering me but life's gonna have
bullies people are gonna try to tear you
down but again going back to what I said
before you have to know your Worth and
if anything it has taught me that like
yeah Michelle you know what you're doing
you know the purpose it doesn't matter
what people like say about you so I am
happy I chose it I think I'm learning
really good discipline and so I just
want to know how you properly deal with
creepy guys staring at you in public
because sure that's the thing you deal
with a lot where you go to school I put
this question was interesting because no
one again really talks about this people
are really creepy in New York City I
remember specifically one time I was
walking down the street I was walking to
church I was wearing like my black jeans
a white button-down and some booties and
like literally the most modest outfit
these two guys were on the side of the
road and they were screaming the most
vulgar things that neither come over
here Barbie and then a lot of other
words that I'm just not gonna repeat
because I have younger peers I do not
want that on my channel and I remember
those things really stuck with me I'm
someone who I think you should not be
filling your mind your ears your eyes
with Vice I think that's really
dangerous and I do think that that I
think it's bad and so for a while I was
really just feeling like I was like
infiltrated with these bad things how do
you deal with it you walk along say
anything you don't try to give them a
look you just walk with your head
straight and you walk on in this all you
can do obviously if it's something
that's creepier and they're actually
like trying to get you to do something
you're trying to get you to like come
with them somewhere like yeah you need
to get help that's where you find
someone who's around you and just go up
to the pretend that you know that and
then you are safe what's the difference
between Michonne high school and now and
college and high school a lot of times I
felt like I had to do things because
everyone else was doing them in terms of
life what kind of events I went to I
mean I didn't like party or anything but
I felt like I had to talk about certain
things because my friends were talking
about them I think in college I feel a
lot more in control of what I do like I
can spend time in areas where I really
feel like I'm being fulfilled and I feel
like I am contributing to who I'm gonna
be in five years in high school I felt
like I didn't really have that
control and I had to do things because
other people are doing them I'm not
saying that having total control over
anything is a healthy thing I think a
lot of people are control freaks that
leads to a lot of greater issues being
able to control where you spend your
time and how you decide to pour into
people
those are all the questions I'm gonna
answer because I'm about to run out of
space but I hope you guys enjoyed this
video definitely if you have any
thoughts on anything I shared leave them
down below I want this to be a community
atmosphere I want this to be a positive
atmosphere and I want us to help each
other so make sure you leave them down
