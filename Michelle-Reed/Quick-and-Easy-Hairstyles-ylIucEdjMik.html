I guess you embrace tea hi guys today
I'm going to be doing a video and this
is going to be my quick and simple
hairstyles that I go to whatever i'm
having a bad hair day because i don't
know about you guys but I tend to have
quite a few of those and something about
me is I'm not very skilled with hair
like I can curl I can strain and I can
braid but I cannot do fancy stuff and so
these hairstyles are literally as easy
as it gets because I am just not very
coordinated with my hair in my hands so
yeah and if you try any of these out
make sure to Instagram a picture or
tweet them to me because I'd love to see
them and yeah without further ado let's
go ahead and get started so the first
hairstyle i'm doing is the high ponytail
and so first I'm just teasing my hair
with my brush just like the crown and
the sides of my hair and then I'm
gathering it all up on the top of my
head you can put it as high as you want
this is the hike i did and then I'm just
securing this all with a hair tie and
then what I'm done I like to pull out
some hairs in the wispy parts of my hair
just to give it some more volume and
make it look a little more messy and
then I take my straightener and I curl
the wisps of my hair because I think
this just gives a nice touch it's
definitely optional if you don't want to
use heat but I think it looks pretty and
then I like to take a piece of hair from
the ponytail and wrap it around the base
and cover the hair tie because I feel
like it makes it look like you tied your
hair with your hair and it just looks
cool and then I hair spray it and that's
it so it's super easy it's simple and I
think it looks very chic
so the next hairstyle is this side braid
so basically what I'm doing is I'm
taking a small section of hair and
braiding it and I will be putting this
into the normal braid because it kind of
gives a nice little touch on the braid
makes it look a little different so I
just do that and then gather my hair in
three pieces and braid normally and it
kind of looks like a snake braid and
it's just kind of a cool touch i like to
do occasionally to spice up a
normal-size read and then I just secure
it and kind of pull more hair out and
loosen everything out and so it looks a
little more messy because I think messy
braids are very pretty and again I just
took out the front parts of the braid
and curled them with my straightener
it's really easy and like I said it kind
of just gives it a more like done up
look like you actually tried so then I'm
just hairspring everything so it stays
throughout the day and the sauce
hairstyle is just the low ponytail or
this is low to me basically all I do is
gather my hair into a low ponytail and
tie it and I kind of loosen it up a
little bit you can tease it if you want
to but I just didn't tease it here and
then I kind of loosen my hair up again
and for the third time I'm curling the
wisps around my hair as you can see this
is kind of a thing I like to do but I
just curled those and yeah that's
basically it for the ponytail it's very
simple and easy but I think it looks
very very classy
so at the end of this video and I hope
you guys enjoyed and like I said make
sure to tag me an Instagram picture or a
Twitter picture or whatever you want
because I'd love to see you guys's
recreations of these lips so yeah I
guess I'll see you guys my next video
