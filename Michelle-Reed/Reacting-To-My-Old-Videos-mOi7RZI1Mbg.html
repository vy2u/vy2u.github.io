that I have wanted to do for such a long
time and finally today I was just like
Michelle you're doing it if you didn't
know I have been on YouTube for quite
some time since about the age of 10 to
be exact so I am quite a few
embarrassing videos that I really would
just like to share with you guys to be
honest because sometimes you just need a
good laugh and if you're having a bad
day this will without a doubt cheer you
up so I have quite a few videos that I
want to show you guys so we're just
gonna go ahead and get right into this
I'm a little scared we're gonna be
honest so when I first started doing
YouTube videos I actually started with
the classic music videos I feel like all
youtubers start with like the
intermediate school music video stages
it's not just me then a let me know this
one is getting lined by Kesha first off
I just like to note that I really needed
braces in this if it's not already
obvious
gotta love those windows movie maker
Thanks you remember those like the
spinny whines and like the wave come on
those root is so awesome Fellini still
use those oh my god
I am totally flossing my teeth for
philosophy here it's quite obvious that
I never use up floss before given the
image of my teeth and it seems to just
go black for the rest of the videos so
that was a great first one next time
we're gonna watch is Supergirl which is
an original music video you got to make
sure you just like shaking the bottle I
still did not use sports remember at the
time I was actually filming this I was
rushing to go to church and so I was
freaking out I was so stressed out so
just a little fun fact wait a sec why
are those dolls naked couldn't even have
like put some clothes on the dolls for
the video way to go Michelle
well that was good this next one is
called vlog and but not like BL of GTIN
it's like BL aw gee I am so that
definitely makes the video like 20 times
cooler but even a real sneeze I honestly
have no idea not using my camera my
parents yes can be jealous d jelsa make
sure they use bomani guys I remember at
the time I was filming this video I went
into seeing like my mom walked into my
room why I don't know so I literally
like open my door and then put the audio
in so it's
like she walked in but she really didn't
oh this one is called the death breath
and I remember working so hard on this
one I'm actually excited that's me
trying to be a librarian Isis is not
only reading Twilight 3d glasses coming
clutch in this video
honestly this video is so creative and
I'm kind of proud of myself like
honestly videos now are not this
creative and not this funny either this
one is called the scary doll I believe
this one is more of a skit so get
excited guys it's all definitely has one
leg I don't know well see ya I'm acting
like I'm 5 in this video but again I was
definitely 11 when this video was filmed
so that was really creepy my face oh my
what it goes from like cute little music
to a knife with ketchup on the ground
why I don't know so this was actually my
first beauty video I believe and it is
an everyday makeup routine and I don't
even think I wore makeup at this time
this selfies Vegas psych oh yes that
looking up pose you gotta love it I
remember I was talking so quietly like
they don't want my parents the Burien
song
I decided to turn out ease up on the
primer is so orange why don't worry
this one is another music video - hello
Seattle showels my sister Jamie for
filming these with me so you know you a
true sister when she sticks with you
through this age again with the teeny I
totally need the braces in this these
colorful effects oh my gosh I remember
this part repeats for so long it's
making me crazy still going still going
still going there yes very good
oh that is the most Awkward hug
oh no the goggles the gun yeah I'm
definitely out after those goggles I
can't see it anymore
so those are all the videos so I'm going
to watch with you guys today I really
hoped you guys got a little bit of a
laugh out of this those old music videos
transformed into this oh I'm forever
thankful and grateful that YouTube
allows people like me like little
ten-year-old Michelle to start a channel
just if you're in the mood to watch some
more of my more updated videos I
actually just uploaded a night routine a
little bit ago and I worked really hard
on it and you guys seemed to really like
it so you should definitely check that
one out and I'll see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
