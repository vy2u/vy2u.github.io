college right now and sometimes college
can get really stressful so I wanted to
do a detoxifying relaxing night routine
so the first thing that I do whenever I
get home is just make the room super
cozy you know open the window turn on
all my twinkly lights and I like to
start boiling some water to make some
matcha and then of course have to change
into my comfy clothes because I don't
like to wear my heels around so after
getting my comfy clothes on I
immediately head to the bathroom to do
skin care and take all of this makeup
off I want to thank bio clarity for
sponsoring this video I'm obsessed with
their product I thought once a week I
like to incorporate products that are
vegan or cruelty-free within my routine
because there are a lot more not true
and as you guys know I've been
developing a skincare routine trying to
ton of products but most of them have a
lot of chemicals and so about once a
week I like to kind of stray from that
routine but I currently really been like
a bio clarity
my first using the cleanse product this
one has cucumber green tea and chamomile
aisle clarity also sells an essentials
routine if you don't have acne prone
skin but more normal to dry skin they
also offer a hydrate skin smoothing
moisturizer that can be added to the
clear skin routine if you have dry skin
but your skin still breaks out and then
using the treat which is the complexion
perfection it's also like acid treatment
I'm currently using the acne prone
system and that's because my skin likes
to break out around final-season because
I'm working a lot in college I really
love this system because it only has
three steps so it is super quick and
easy because y'all know I get busy in
college and the last step is actually
the restore power of green a floral acts
product
this actually is chlorophyll in it which
if you don't know flora felt is super
good for your skin that helps detoxify
and it helps kind of balance your system
and incorporating this into our routine
and guy and it's so cool because it's
literally like actually green so it's
just like fun to put on I personally
really love my bio clarity system I
think it's great so I'll have it linked
down below if you want to check it out
and you can also use my discount code
right here on the screen if you want to
get it for a cheaper price and then I go
ahead and head out of my bathroom and I
start pouring I'm watch it together I
love this kind it is the mushroom matcha
drink Megson I can't even taste the
mushroom but it is so warm and relaxing
and I usually get home at about 3:30 to
4:00 so it's still not too late they
have a little bit of caffeine
so now is my chill time but I like to
sit here with my matcha and do whatever
the heck I feel like doing I am someone
who really values always being
productive and getting things done but I
recently had a really bad bit of anxiety
for about a month I posted a vlog about
if you want to watch it but I basically
talked about how I wasn't like chilling
out and I wasn't giving myself time to
just recharge and so I like to spend at
least like 30 minutes to an hour and I
doing this I have been so so active on
Instagram lately I have really been
trying to actually respond to DMS a lot
of you guys will DM me asking for advice
and while I can't respond to every
single one of them I have been so much
better at actually responding to them on
Instagram and so you should definitely
reach out to me on Instagram if you have
a question you should follow me I'm
super active on Instagram I like to set
goals for myself and one of my goals
right now is to hit fifty thousand
followers by July so what I do think
it's possible so if you want to follow
me you definitely should I really just
want to help you guys out and I think
that is one of the best platforms to
really hear from you guys
you can also just hear the birds
chirping whenever the window is open and
it's so nice another thing that helps me
show recently instead of taking my notes
at church on a notebook I actually take
them on my planner my cleaner has this
really nice section where you can
actually write down a page of notes
obviously down below it's from wool skin
it's super simple and I love it but I
find whenever I'm planning my day
whenever I'm just working throughout the
week I always have my notes besides just
to kind of remind me what I'm grounded
in Brent since our last sermon was about
rest and the Sabbath and how it's
important that we take a break and just
seeing that reminds me you know like
what I'm grounded in and what I should
be focusing on and it just kind of keeps
me thinking about the sermon throughout
the week so now it's time for dinner and
I'm going to make a nice dinner any time
I like to detoxify it really relax
making like a good healthy dinner is
exactly what I like to do so I'm going
to pan fry some salmon and I'm also
gonna make some Brussels sprout I'm not
super hungry tonight I just have the
matcha so I'm still like pretty cool
from that I think I'm I eat it on the
roof cuz it's nice outside so healthy
eating is so important for me even in
college if you guys want me to do like a
whole video on my favorite recipes and
just kind of tips to eating healthy I
think I've done a pretty good job in
college and it's honestly something I'm
super passionate about so I might do
that if you want to see it I then like
to put on a hoodie and just head on up
to the roof so they're doing
construction so it's not that cute up
here but it's my last year living at
this apartment so I wanted to do this
more often and I hate letting dishes sit
there so I go ahead and do the dishes
even if I tell myself to leave them I
always end up doing them so even on a
night that I'm trying to like detox and
I realistically probably still have
homework to do and so I'm gonna sit down
and do some stuff it's my finals week
next week and I have a presentation
Friday and I need to put together my
PowerPoint so I'm gonna do that tonight
but it's not as much work as I usually
have so I think it's still kind of
classified as it becomes because I'm not
doing homework for like six hours or
anything for my marketing class we
actually had to run a blog and so my
final is a final presentation on
pitching my blog so if you guys want to
check it out it's called the shy girls
guide to growing up and it's been super
fun I've done a ton of articles on there
so it'll be linked down below but then I
just like to head to my shower time I
always take my showers at night because
it really calms me down and then tonight
I decided to self tan a lot of you guys
asked what self-tanner I use and I just
used the st. Tropez I basically put it
everywhere about my face and I think it
leaves like a really nice tan then I
throw on a nightgown and get cozy so
before I go to bed something that has
also been helping anxiety is writing
down ten things that I'm thankful for at
the end of the night really simple
things big things whatever they may be
this really helps just call me down it
helps kind of end the day on a positive
note
and that is it for my relaxing night
routine I know this might be similar to
my productive routine but to me this
kind of is the epitome of relaxation and
this is my form of relaxation we all
relax differently so that's okay and
don't forget to check out bio clarity I
will have them linked down below
incorporating vegan cruelty free
products you know once a week throughout
my routine is really important to me and
it's really been helping my skin keep
its sanity while college is tearing me
apart so I hope you guys check them out
and I'll see you guys in my next video
