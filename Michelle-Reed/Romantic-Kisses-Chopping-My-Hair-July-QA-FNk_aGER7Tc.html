you guys understand this is like you've
gone through everything together so
hello everybody today I'm going to be
doing a July Q&amp;amp;A video because I asked
for questions on my Instagram some that
were a little more you know tangy if you
will also i know the back line i know
you guys can hear my air conditioner in
the back room i'm really sorry but I
need to film this video because Sun is
setting and I won't be able to film for
a week don't be stressing out so we're
just gonna go ahead and film this if you
ever want me to answer your question
make sure to follow my instagram and you
know maybe my Twitter because sometimes
I'll ask questions on there too so
definitely go follow both those things
before you watch this video so let's
just go ahead and get into my dirty
little secrets so the first question I
got was if my first kiss was romantic
now I don't know about you guys but
usually first kisses are pretty awkward
and strange because you don't know what
you're doing and you're just kind of
staining their you're just like I I
don't know what's going on I mean it was
a good kiss but it wasn't something that
was like in the movies if you know what
I mean because usually that's not a
first kisses go so someone asked if I
would ever get any tattoos or piercing I
don't know about you guys but when I'm
like 80 I don't think I'm gonna want
like a dreamcatcher going down my side
so i just don't think i'll ever get any
tattoos i mean or not against them but
just me personally I don't think I'd
ever get me piercings I don't really
know I kind of want to like cartilage
pierced or any other ear piercings but
anything outside my ears I don't really
want to get peers I can be a princess
what princess would I be if I can be a
princess I think I was definitely the
aerial because she swims and she can
still breathe underwater well except
didn't she get like change though I
would be Ariel so I could swim
underwater and like swim with the fish
and still be a princess I just think
that's awesome so someone asked if I was
ever thinking of cutting my hair I know
that a lot of people are cutting their
hair short right now and I think it's
kind of a cute tread but I don't think
that I'm going to cut mine I do want to
get more layers and my highlights redone
because they kind of faded my hair is a
piece of me I don't think you guys
understand this is like you've gone
through everything together so what was
the last text that I said it was yeah
it's just easier to do currently trying
to look at questions and my phone keeps
freezing and i'm going to someone asks
if being a youtuber I've ever scared
about what people think about me like my
friends and my family and such someone
thinks that it's stupid or that I'm just
talking to a camera that's really dumb
it doesn't really bother me because I
love doing it and if I love doing
something I don't really let other
people influence my choice of doing so
what is your most common thoughts in the
day what I want to watch on netflix what
deodorant brand do you use secrets
someone asks how to be self-confident i
actually just uploaded a video on this
so make sure to go check it out yeah
that's all you really need to see about
how i personally stay confident that's
really creepy the thing I've stood my
eyes hair us fingers or fingers as hair
as just imagining what it'd be like to
have hairs fingers definitely i'd rather
have fingers as hair because then i
could just like go around and like
creepy boss will I be making
back-to-school videos this year yes I
will definitely be doing back to school
video i think i'll be doing them in the
beginning of august to the middle of
August because I really really want to
start those because school is so much
fun like who doesn't love school I don't
someone asks what the craziest most
daring thing that I have ever done was I
think the most interesting thing i've
done is i went cliff jumping the other
day which basically you just jump off
cliffs and hope you don't die and it was
so much fun I mean the water levels were
okay and there wasn't any rocks below so
it was really safe but it was so much
fun and kind of just like exhilarating
I'll be going back I think next week or
so and doing it and I'm so excited
because it makes me feel like a rebel
cuz i'm so the opposite of a rebel so my
question about what my craziest dream
was so I had this dream that there are
these people called Achilles which are
actually like the Doodlebops people I
think that's the name of them but they
would run and chase you and they would
try to kill you and like this music
would play in your house that was like
dunk did it in a double digit and you
have to run down the street and this is
to help the people that were trying to
kill you like get their anger out so
it's kind of like the purge I basically
like invented the purge before it was
movie so yeah but it was honestly the
creepiest thing ever and it was so weird
and it's a reoccurring dream for me and
I don't really know what it means but it
freaks me out if it's crazy crazy high
or low waisted shorts if your shorts are
high waisted what are they so that's
going to be the I don't know why I keep
doing like this hand clapping but it has
got to go that's the end of this Q&amp;amp;A
video like always I hope you guys
enjoyed this so much I also want to let
you guys know that for the next week
I'll be at dance camp so I won't really
be replying to comments and interacting
and uploading is often because I will be
dancing all day make sure to give this
video a like if you liked knowing more
my personal life and those kind of
things because I think it's fun to kind
of see into youtuber
is lives and that they're not just these
people who sit around and talk to the
cameras all the time but I'm going to go
ahead and go and edit this and i'll see
you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
