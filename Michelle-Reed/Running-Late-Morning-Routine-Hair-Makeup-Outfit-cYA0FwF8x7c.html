bubbly no worries I'll just - in my room
goodbyes are life lift it official we
must prevent this so immediately when
you wake up in the morning go ahead and
turn on your heat tool just so this can
heat up while you're brushing your teeth
moisturizing your face all that good
stuff I'd also suggest taking showers at
night so in the morning you don't have
to worry about it control the one you
give it takes a lot as much as I love
this bun I definitely wanted to change
my hair so I just brushed through it and
applied this split end their appeal Ajay
got in my glossy box and I applied this
to the ends of my hair because it helps
it not be frizzy and I just threw it
into a ponytail and I curled my hair
really fast literally this took five
minutes and then I took the ponytail
down and you get these really nice like
wavy curls I promise it's super fast and
it looks better to me than just leaving
my hair straight for makeup I'm using
some products in my glossy box which
I'll have a link down below I'm not
doing foundation I'm just doing
concealer because you do not have time
for foundation whenever you are late
lemme tell ya
also just set my concealer with some
pressed powder and then I did my brows I
filled them in with a pencil not really
necessary but I just really love having
my defined brows
I'd also suggest using a Coralie
shimmery blush this is really going to
make you look awake in the morning all I
really did for my eyes was apply a cream
shade under my brow into the inner
corners and then I applied a champagne
color to my lid this just really makes
me look awake without having to apply a
ton of eye products instead of applying
eyeliner to the top of my eyes all I did
was smudge a little bit of this olive
eyeliner to my lashes and then I applied
my laura geller mascara if I minimize
the rest of my makeup I like to kind of
go bold on the lips so I used this lip
tar which was an orange e color just to
brighten up the whole look and that was
it
this makeup took me about 10 minutes so
pretty awesome now breakfast time is not
really something I like to dip on
because honestly I love food so I just
put some butter on a biscuit and I
drizzled some honey on it I love to put
this in the microwave for about 15
seconds or so and then it tastes so good
it doesn't look that appealing but guys
it tastes awesome so pretty quick to
make not the fastest but breakfast is
important guys and you also cannot
forget to make some coffee for the go
and I've been diggin French Vanilla
creamer lately so you guys should
definitely try it out
whenever I'm driving to school I always
realize that I forgot to put on perfume
so I like to put on some travel kind on
the go so I smell great for my outfit
I'm wearing this romper from Urban
Outfitters robbers are super quick and
easy because you just slip them on you
don't worry about like pants or shirt
because they're literally pants and a
shirt and this one has pockets so it's
definitely a bonus and then for shoes
I'm wearing some converse because I
thought it'd be cute with this outfits
and that's pretty much it for this video
thank you all so much for watching this
video I really hope you guys enjoyed it
