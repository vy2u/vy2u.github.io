Michelle tells video which is kind of my
Q&amp;amp;A advice series if you didn't know I
don't think I made that known but I just
asked for questions on my Instagram so
anything from you know advice that you
need or questions you want to know about
myself just literally anything goes so
definitely follow me on there because I
will randomly just shout out that I am
doing a Q&amp;amp;A and then i will put all the
comments right here and it's really fun
also i'm going to MIT and be a very bad
youtuber but I've kind of been at a loss
for video ideas so if you have any
specific requests that you would like to
see leave them down below I would
appreciate that more than you know and
it kind of just gives me an idea of what
you guys would like to see so yeah
that's pretty much everything that I
have to say so let's get on into the
questions and Link asked how often do
you work out and I've been trying to
create kind of a schedule lately but I
definitely work out every Monday Tuesday
Wednesday and Thursday so at least four
days out of the week I don't really do
it every single day of the week I would
like to but I definitely do it at least
four days of the week Breanna Turner
asked how do you gain self love when you
are constantly comparing yourself to
others i love you i love you too and i
think you kind of answered your question
yourself you can't compare yourself to
others or else you're not going to love
yourself loving yourself comes with
understanding how valuable you are and
how we are all fearfully and wonderfully
made and we're all individuals and we're
not meant to look the same you're not
meant to look like the girl that you
think is really pretty that you're
comparing yourself to you're meant to
look the way that you were created to
look and so I think that's just the most
important thing is finding your
confidence in yourself and just
recognizing that you're your own unique
individual and you were crafted in such
a wonderful way and just to question
that crafting is an insult in itself so
just know that you are so valuable and
that you are too valuable to compare
yourself to other people Jeff its east
asked how do you deal with your friends
and you slowly separating and what I'd
have to say is that separating from your
friends if it feels natural like you're
just changing into different people and
you're no longer as compatible as you
used to be it's also your data
my friends you kind of just have to let
that happen because people change and
it's inevitable and it's just going to
happen but if it's not change and you
feel like maybe there were just some
underlying problems that need to be
addressed address those problems and try
to work it out and talk to them
face-to-face because if your friends are
worth it and you know they're going to
be in it for the long run then it's
worth just confronting those problems
hey herb ass are you creating a glowing
channel if so would you do vlogmas I've
actually thought about kick-starting my
watch channel on the first day of
vlogmas so starting volleying on
december first let me know if you guys
would like that I have been talking
about doing a blog channel for like the
past six months so I'm really really
sorry but this time it's for real guys
so yeah I really really want to do that
and then after vlogmas I probably just
start doing weekly vlogs because I love
logging and I kind of want to document
the rest of my year before I go to
college so I have time to like look back
upon the memories that I made senior
year so if you're down for that and you
would like that like this video like
right now I just think blogging would be
so much fun and I really want to do Lori
Healey ask what's one of the biggest
challenges you had in your youtube
career I love you by the way I love you
so much too how are the biggest
challenge for me not necessarily a
challenge but something that I've had to
accept it's just staying true to myself
despite being on the internet because
the Internet is honestly so crazy and
especially on youtube I feel it's very
easy to sell out and just make content
that you know will get the views and you
know we'll make a lot of money but that
you're not necessarily passionate about
that's something that I've definitely
been working on lately is trying to get
videos that I know that you guys would
like but that stay true to myself and
that I'm passionate about finding that
balance has been just the biggest
challenge for me because I never want to
sell out and I never want to look at my
channel and be like wow this doesn't
even reflect myself so that's probably
the biggest thing for me Nardo see Jana
asked if you could eliminate one
weakness from your life what would it be
i am not a confrontational person i will
just admit right now if there's a
problem i tend to just run away from it
or just kind of sweep it under the rug
and
do other things not that I avoid my
problems and do things that are
productive like I will avoid my problems
by you know like doing homework or
something that's beneficial but see
that's the only be one thing that i
would change is just being more
confrontational and addressing problems
that need to be addressed Sabrina done
asked I've been friends at the sky for a
while and i think i might have feelings
for him but i'm scared if i tell them
it'll ruin our relationship what should
I do now I'm gonna be honest this is
kind of a tricky question to answer and
I definitely see two sides to this but I
feel like the side of just telling this
guy that you like in kind of overpowers
because for myself personally I feel
like us as girls women have a right to
know if guys like them and if let's say
you've been hanging out for a couple
months now and you just want to know
because maybe you feel like both those
feelings are there like you like him he
likes you then just go ahead and ask him
and tell him that hey I kind of
interested in you and I just want to
know if you feel the same so I don't
necessarily know if that's going to ruin
your relationship if say he doesn't like
you in that way but I do think that you
have the right to know and he deserves
to know if you like it so hand ursans
asked what are your plans after high
school are you going to college yes i am
going to college I know people on
YouTube don't always go to college and
that's fine i don't think college for
everyone there's kind of like this
negative connotation with not going to
college but I am I think education is
really important for what I want to do
having degrees definitely very
beneficial so i am going to college
don't ask me where because i don't know
quite yet but i definitely see yeah
those are only questions that i have to
answer if you'd like to follow my
instagram it'll be right here you should
have to check this out I don't have a
cool Instagram thing or anything but I

featured at my next cutie which is cool
