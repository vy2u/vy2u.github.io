something that I have wanted to talk
about for a while now and it is a
relationship goals it's 2016 I am coming
up with a lot of goals for myself things
like trying new things like accepting
change taking risks being a better
person but you know it's not a goal a
relationship I've seen this term going
around on Twitter and Instagram and
YouTube for a while and quite frankly I
am sick and tired of it I'm not gonna
act like I'm above it because I admit I
have said this term quite often you see
a really cute relationship with a guy on
a girl and you're like oh relationship
golden it just comes naturally now which
is sad because this isn't a goal both of
these goals are complete unrealistic
fairy tales you know you see on Twitter
a guy who buys a girl some Victoria's
Secret sweatpants or bi as a girl a car
or Michael Kors watch or just all these
different things and they aren't real
because that's not what a relationship
is about and that's not how the average
relationship is especially what I've
noticed is people getting very
unrealistic expectations about what a
relationship is they honestly think that
relationships are about buying each
other things or going on really cool
trips they're just awesome I'm not
saying those things are bad because I
think it's nice to treat somebody but
that's not entirely what a relationship
is about that's probably like two
percent of a relationship it's honestly
love is so much more than gifts it is
hard it's a lot of work you know you
fight with someone that you love because
you truly care about them you're going
to argue you're going to get an argument
and you're gonna say things you don't
mean that's love that's what it is
because you care about that person not
because you're gonna buy them a watch or
a trip or whatever it may be you know
there's so much more than that and I
feel like this age of social media has
confused what love is because that's not
love at all it shouldn't take thousands
of dollars to make somebody's smile
that's something that happens in other
ways with a conversation or a moment or
something that's not sharing on social
media those can also be ways to show
love I feel like our media now
glamorizes people who have it all and
take these trips which is okay I'm not
saying that's bad but that isn't all
that a relationship is about there are
other ways to show your love than merely
put it on social
I've honestly seen people look for these
things in a relationship look for
someone who showers them with gifts and
trips and all these things it's
literally become an obsession it's
become something that people do which
sounds crazy you wouldn't think that
someone actually looks for someone that
does these things but they do it's what
social media has done because media is
so powerful for me personally there's no
point and investing your time than
making your relationship look really
good on the Internet if it's not exactly
how that relationship looks on the
Internet
there's no point I mean yeah you can
share moments that you think are
valuable and pictures I love that I
think Instagram is awesome for
photography and just seeing in other
people's lives and keeping up with other
people but you should not have to work
to keep up this image of yourself or
this image of you and your boyfriend are
you and your girlfriend I think we've
kind of developed this look of what a
perfect relationship is and that's not
true there isn't a perfect relationship
everyone's different two people are
different everyone's unique and they're
not all gonna be the same you know
different strokes for different folks as
they say but it's true because we aren't
all the same and relationships are going
to be different and they're gonna come
in different shapes and sizes and that's
okay that's what makes it so much fun is
that you know you can have different
relationships that look different when
it comes down to it you only see what
people allow you to see you don't see
the bad things you don't see the
arguments no one's gonna post a picture
of them fighting with their boyfriend
saying oh my gosh
he totally ticked me off today no one's
gonna do that maybe they'll suck tweet
about it but they're not gonna post a
picture of that and that's okay because
fighting is okay and arguing is fine
like I said earlier you know that's part
of relationship and that's reality and
we can't confuse this false perception
that we put up on the internet with what
reality actually is because in the end
the vacation is gonna end the jewelry is
gonna wither away and you're probably
never gonna run in those limited-edition
Nikes that he bought you a couple years
ago let's be honest but the person that
you're with is always gonna be there and
when it comes down to it you should make
sure that that person is who you want to
date not hey I want to date this person
because they can
things yeah that's cool to show what
you've been doing with your boyfriend or
your girlfriend that's funny if you want
a trip okay I'm not trying to make that
sound like a bad thing because it's not
but I want to protect the viewers and
the young woman and the young men and
the thinking that that's not exactly how
dating is and that's not reality so I'm
gonna talk about some things that are
actual goals actual goals that I have
for my future husband
or the guy that I'm dating number one
someone who supports me I am my biggest
critic guys I'm so hard on myself and
it's really important for me and I think
anyone to date someone that truly
supports them because I'm always hard on
myself and sometimes I just need someone
to be like you know what Michelle you're
doing pretty good right now you got it
together you need to stop beating
yourself up over this at the same time
that doesn't mean they shouldn't
challenge you I want to be challenged I
want to make myself a better person and
I think the person that I'm dating
should do that they should question me
and make sure that I firm we believe in
the things that I believe and that I
make the best choices I wanna be called
out when I'm screwing up whenever I am
being a total diva I want to be like hey
you know what you're treating me like
crap and that's not what I deserve and
that's how you should be challenged on a
day-to-day basis also someone who you
genuinely enjoy being around a big bio
Michael Kors purse but they're a total
jerk is it really hard at the spending
your time with that person just because
they shower you with gifts for me I want
to actually enjoy my time I think our
time is so valuable and you can't get it
back so you need to make sure the people
that you are giving your time to deserve
that time cuz I like to have fun
and I like to laugh and I like to have a
break from reality sometimes and just
enjoy my time and I would want the
person that I'm dating to be worthy at
that time I know this one is cliche
cheesy you've heard it so many times but
someone who completes you who makes you
a better person it's so cheesy and I
know we hear this all the time but it's
true you want someone who is a better
version of yourself that can actually
you know you see yourself being with and
lastly this is something just kind of
personal but I want someone who shares
the same values as me
outlook on the world who I can share
these opinions with and we agree on
because I think that's important in
establishing a long-term relationship in
the end I'm just saying that we
shouldn't build our relationships off of
this image on social media it's not
right it's not healthy and in the end
it's just not genuine it's 2016 I really
want to try to keep moments to myself
and be more personal there's value and
keeping certain moments to yourself a
conversation is something that you saw
something that you shared with your
boyfriend or girlfriend you know it's
special keeping things to yourself and
not necessarily having to put them on
social media which I know I'm guilty of
gunnars been in a lot of my videos I
don't take that back I wouldn't redo
that if I had to but there are some
times when I'm like I should have put
that picture up that was such a personal
moment it wasn't meant for the internet
and that's just something I'm gonna work
on in 2016 also there's more than
relationships if you're single that's
okay our generation has this thing I'm
making people feel like if they're
single that they're bad and then you
have to be in a relationship so not true
if you're single work on yourself be
selfish you know comment the person that
you want to be you don't need to be in a
relationship that's just crap and I
don't think that we should teach
teenagers and young adults that that's
how it is let me know what your outlook
is on relationship goals - we should
stop it because it is getting a little
bit too much in too far and I honestly
just wanted to post this video to kind
of see what your guys opinions are
because I love reading opinions I love
seeing comments and I would like to know
yours if you want to become a morning
person you should check out my last
video it's all about how to be a morning
person because I am and I think everyone
should because it's a great thing to be
no offense night house I'll see you guys
my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
