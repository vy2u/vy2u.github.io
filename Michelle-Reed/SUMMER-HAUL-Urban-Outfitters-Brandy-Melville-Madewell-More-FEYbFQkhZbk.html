little gadgets behind me and I'm kinda
like sitting here so today I'm sitting
here it's not permanent but I just
decided that I would today I am doing a
summer clothing and accessory haul I
just have a few things to show you guys
what I actually don't have very many
things but the things that I have I'm
really excited for so I figured I would
go ahead and do it we've got some main
well stuff Urban Outfitters brandy
melville choice random really cute sup
and a new pair of tennis shoes and I'm
so excited for you guys to see you you
should definitely subscribe if you are
new to my channel I'd love to have you
here watching videos regularly so yeah
let's just go ahead and get into the
video we are first starting out with
made well because made well is actually
my new official favorite store
everything in the store is just really
my style and simple a little too
expensive but it's okay first top I got
I've been wearing like crazy it is just
a really plain denim tank top that's
kind of braid at the bottom and then in
the back you kinda opens up the bottom
like this and then I has a little zipper
on the top so very simple but it goes
with so many different things and where
I live it's really hot so tank tops like
this are so necessary also just really
good material like it's so well made and
it's made well absolutely stock which is
a little bit different I don't have
anything like this but it's just a short
sleeves plaid kind of oversized top like
this is an extra extra small and it's
kind of so big so already pairing this
with like some black jeans and
little tan boonies and like a long
necklace I understand he's so cute with
this also stops at Urban Outfitters and
I only got three things here and they're
all the same but in different colors
it's actually the bralette that I'm
wearing right now I got a cream one a
black one and then I made green one
there's really comfortable and nice and
Lacey and great for days right you don't
really mean like a whole lot of support
because they really don't have a whole
lot of support in them but they're
really comfy for the summertime so I
thought a cream one a black one and then
like this mint green one would be good
to wear I also want to brandy Velva
which I don't go to very often but in
Pakistan they have a little section
there then while I was in New York I
actually got a couple pieces that I
never showed you guys so I thought I'd
go ahead and do right now this hop I got
more recently it's just a maroon
oversized really soft tea really cute
really soft I think just soft shirts
like this are such staples and you're
gonna wear the most honestly this is a
t-shirt dress that is also very soft
it's just a very long drapey t-shirt
dress this honestly doesn't really do
anything for you it kind of makes you
look like a stack but it's so
comfortable stone stuff like this is
great for the summer times it's nice and
airy this one is also a maroon dress but
it's just really really long really
flowy at the bottom and it's a very like
thick material which I like I love stuff
that you can tell was well made as I got
on this on you great for the summer time
because it's nice and flowy so then I
got some stuff from choies and I got
this two-piece which is really cute
the bottoms look like this they're just
leaf pattern for the front really cute I
love this pattern except mini rants here
that
at the top which I'll kind of insert a
picture cuz I don't have it
but the top was so small like I do not
know any human being who could fit in it
if they weren't a child it was so little
and the thing about this is I order
these in their a medium and I think this
is a pretty good size their medium
shorts but the top was so small and
sometimes different choice is just
unbelievably small and I'm just like
really it's frustrating and it makes me
mad also this didn't have a class so I
have a safety pin right here to safety
pin them together so that's also
frustrating it's just clothes that are
not well made and I also got three three
pairs of sunglasses because I've been
I'm a little sunglasses kick lately oh
my gosh
these ones are literally missing a thing
I don't well I did get these sunglasses
which are just black little um no it's
called me maybe Cataline but they are
missing a little I think I would call
that piece and yeah that's great don't
buy these I got these ones which are a
lot more well-made they're just blue cat
eyes circle sunglasses these there's so
much fun I don't know if I wear these
like seriously out in public but they
look really cute in videos they're just
so funky and I don't know I really like
them and I wore them in my cupboards Hox
video and a lot of people said they like
them though these last ones are just
circle tortoiseshell sunglasses so they
are just gold and tortoiseshell and
circles I know I just feel like with the
right outfit thank you you know they are
a little strange but I don't know
they're growing on me
a little bit life's too short to wear
boring sunglasses also it's a Victoria
Secret because they were having their
semi-annual sale and I got this swimsuit
which crosses at the front and then it
has like black class I really like the
colors I love this neon pink and neon
purple they do make you like nice and
tan and I like this it was on sale I
forgot the price but it was a good price
also for my birthday Gunnar got me this
t-shirt that I thought I'd just throw in
because I love it it says youtubing is
my cardio and I just think that's so
cute and funny I just have those really
cute and I don't know something I could
throw on whenever I'm just feeling lazy
and wanting to wear a t-shirt so yeah
really cute I have no idea where he got
this just somewhere online I suppose but
I really so for shoes I have two pairs
of shoes to show you guys these ones are
from Target they're just gold strappy
sandals I have a brown pair of these and
I've worn them for a year and I wear
them all the time they go with
everything so decided to get a gold pair
because I wear a lot of gold jewelry so
I thought these would match the best so
now for my last clothing piece I got
some new tennis shoes which I'm so
excited for they are so they are like
neon pink and then that really pretty
cobalt blue color and they're so nice
and comfortable these are the flight
knit ones so they're really light I've
been using these for running and also
for my dance team we wear tennis shoes
and some of our dances whenever we're
practicing it's like kick or military
dance will wear these and so I just
needed like some comfortable lightweight
shoes for that and these have been
awesome I got these at the Nike outlet
store so they were a little bit on sale
not super on say although so they're
really cute though and I really needed
some new tennis shoes because I haven't
bought any for like three years now so
those are all the things that I have to
show you guys I really hope that you
like this if you've been doing any
shopping let me let me know if you found
any deals or if any stores or having
good sales because I love for my
shopping addiction to be fed it would
if you haven't watched my last video you
should definitely do that right now it
was a day in my life birthday then
shouldn't video so you got to see what I
did and I also showed you guys what I
got for my birthday in that video if
you'd like to see it so yeah that's
everything I have to say for this video
and I hope you guys are having a great
summer bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
