for two reasons number one is a summer
morning routine and if you're new to my
channel I know a lot of people just
watch these from people who they don't
really know my name is Michelle read I
post beauty fashion lifestyle videos
three times a week you should click
below and subscribe and also I have been
working with the company called centrum
for the past month or so actually
designing my own exclusive scent and so
this video is made in collaboration with
them simply sent trunk it's a company
that sends you personalized fragrances
each month so how it works is they send
us test your kit first with like a few
kind of key sense and then you tell them
if you like that if you don't like them
what you're really feeling and then they
craft a scent basically for you and they
send it to you the best part is it's
eleven ninety-nine a month which is such
a great price and there's also free
shipping and if you don't like it you
can send it back and they will send you
a new scent completely for free you can
even switch it up every month or you can
just kind of make one scent that you get
every single month so I actually got to
go through the whole process of making
my own perfume set which was super duper
cool so I literally have my own scent
that is super sweet and floral and
really really perfect and you guys have
really really enjoyed it fast and
actually an exclusive batch though so
there are only a limited quantity of
them so make sure if you want it you get
it you guys can actually like buy my set
and have something of mine is just
really really cool and something that I
never really thought I would be doing
basically no one else is going to smell
like you which is the coolest thing ever
and you all have to go to Sephora and
like test out a ton of reviews that
honestly all end up smelling too safe
you can literally do everything sitting
on your bed at home if you'd like to try
my own scent it is actually available
for a very limited amount of time so
make sure you get it down below its $18
but there is also free shipping or you
go through the whole process yourself
and make your own perfume all links down
below scent trunk let's go ahead and get
right into the video
so my morning usually starts around 8:30
or 9:00 this is like usually when I
naturally kind of wake up and then I
usually kind of sit and think about what
I have to do and usually it's something
to do with editing a vlog I've been
blogging all the time on my second
channel which is Michelle out of her
shell so I usually like to get that done
in the morning this I can get up a vlog
for you guys so if usual hi morning
consists of and then I just make my bed
head into the bathroom and I'll just
wash my face and brush my teeth and put
on some lotion all the normal stuff and
then I like to go ahead and head to the
gym going to the gym is really important
to me if I'd like don't start my day
with it I just feel really weird
sometimes I go at night but I usually
like to go around 10 o'clock so usually
just head there I have a ton of workout
videos linked down below so if you want
to check them out they will be there and
also on the screen right here after the
gym I will usually get back in my car
and sometimes I go pick up some coffee
so that's what I did I've been loving a
grande iced coffee with one pump of
sugar-free mocha syrup and soy milk it's
really really good and then I'll just
head back into my house and make some
breakfast today i sided megan acai bowl
so this is what I decided to put inside
of it and so I'll just blend that up in
my ninja bullet and then add some
granola some bananas sometimes odd
berries if I have them but we didn't
have any and so this is just what my
acai bowl consisted of sometimes I make
eggs sometimes I make toast with some
avocado on it whatever I'm feeling then
I usually just do some work reply to
some emails edit more videos if I have
to then I'll just head into the bathroom
and I will get ready to take my shower
usually do a little dance I played some
John Mayer and John Mayer always busy
pumped up so that is why I'm dancing
like a weirdo right here and then after
I get out of the shower I just head back
into my room and I get ready for Monday
I started off with lotion and then I
apply my pixie Petra illuminator I love
this does it makes my skin really really
glowy and pretty because I've been
really into that lately and then just
mixing two Clinique foundations one is
the acne one and then one is the super
balance to get my perfect shade and then
I'll just apply my Maybelline anti-aging
concealer which you guys know I use in
like every single video I just blend
this out with my Real Techniques sponge
and then I'm supplying a little bit of
this almay translucent powder just very
very lightly because I like to keep
things really nice and fresh glowy and
then just browsing my skin with my Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer then I'm
just applying kind of a peach color
blush from wet and wild all over my
cheekbones and then I'm just using my
Clinique chubby highlight in the shade
hefty highlight to my cheekbones nose
forehead and chin and I use Mac soft and
gentle over top it out to kind of set it
then just fill in my brows with a little
bit of brow gel this one is from Rimmel
nothing too crazy just light using my
meat matrimony palette I just apply a
brown color in the crease and then I'm
using this the bomb / shadow and the
shade no money no honey on my lid then
was curling my eyelashes applying my
covergirl LashBlast mascara using a
little bit of lip liner and then I'm
just using my NYX lingerie liquid
lipstick I thought I was really lazy so
I just did some dry shampoo in my hair
which I know is kind of gross after you
work out but we all do it so let's not
shame here in this video okay I then use
my signature scent from scent truck
which I am loving guys I'll have it
linked down below seriously check it out
it smells so good it's literally my
favorite summer scent right now and I'm
loving it
I'll then head into my living room and
I'll just work on some YouTube stuff
whether that be planning on a video and
this one I'm planning a healthy eating
video if I was researching some recipes
include and all that good stuff I
usually just get some work done right
here and that is basically what my
morning consists of
