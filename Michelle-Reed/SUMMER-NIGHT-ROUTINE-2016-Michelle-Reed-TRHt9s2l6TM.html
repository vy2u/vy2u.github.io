getting colder
I told dawn half the time hi guys in
today's video I'm going to be doing a
summer at night routine because on my
summer morning routine I asked if you
guys would like to see this video and a
lot of you guys told me that you did so
I decided to make it for you guys pour
begins to the video I wanted to talk
about a super cool app that is called
show room before we get started
basically what this app is is you create
very short videos so like 30 to 45
seconds about things that you are liking
kind of like a favorites video on
YouTube you just edit the videos within
the app and then you send it out with a
link to the product and you can share it
with your friends to show your friends
you know what you've been liking and
just products that you're really
enjoying right now you can create these
videos really really easily you just at
home basically you just go in the app
and then you can edit them together and
do a voiceover and on music it's all
within the app which is super cool
because you want to use a bunch of
different ones or anything
you can even monetize your shows once
you gain a significant following so you
can make money off of these things I
think it's cool because a lot of people
ask me about things that I'm wearing
they're just things that I'm enjoying
right now and I thought the app would be
a really cool way just to show you guys
you know like things that I like and so
I could directly link it to you guys it
also earned show bucks whenever you
create your virtual shows or gain
followers which can convert into actual
cash so it's a great way to make money
as well because I know a lot of people
right now on the summertime are just
trying to make money also the first
three users in show room to gain a
thousand followers actually will make a
thousand dollars cash which is super
cool so I will have my link down below
actually made an exclusive video on
there on how to style the bandanas and
I've been loving lately because I'm one
of my past intros a lot of you guys
wanted to see that link will be down
below as well as the link to sign up and
create your own showroom which I would
definitely recommend doing and as always
if you're dating my channel you should
definitely subscribe the button will be
right here and I upload about twice a
week and let's just go ahead and get
into the video
so my nights usually start off with
dinner
six or seven and I definitely don't eat
out every night I just happen to be out
with Gunnar tonight and so that's what I
film for you guys and I really really
like this place called snappy salads
it's super yummy and I honestly don't
really like salads at all but this place
makes the best salads that are like the
least salad II salads if that makes
sense so I really really like this place
I was actually vlogging here as well and
just wanted to give a quick shout out to
my vlog channel Michelle out of her
shell because I always home vlogs on
there I also wanted to show you guys a
little outfit of the day my top that I'm
wearing right here is from forever 21
and my skirt was thrifted and so I don't
really know the exact brand I had
actually never heard of it and then my
necklace is from world market I stole it
from my sister of course and my purse is
from Italy so it's not able to be bought
and then my watch is from Daniel
Wellington and my sandals are from made
well then I just head back on over to my
house and I usually go my sister Jamie's
room and I just lay there for like an
hour and we watch vlogs and such and
hang out with our dog Roxy we really
loved watching Eric Conover's vlogs
together so we usually do that or I'll
talk to my other sister Lindsey or my
mom or my dad just kind of my time to
like hang out with my family because I
do think that's very important then it's
time to cleanse and wash my face so I
usually start off by taking off my
makeup with my Neutrogena makeup wipes I
love these and I've used them for years
and then I'm using my al Genest face
wash which I recently started using
again and I really really like it it's
really smooth and it always makes my
skin super soft and then I toned my face
with my Clinique facial toner which is
great and tonight if you're on a face
mask this is my favorite origins
charcoal one I love this guy's it's such
a good mask and then I just wash that
off and brush my teeth and that's pretty
much it for my nighttime skincare
routine then I go back in my room and I
really like to edit at night for some
reason I always feel so much more
creative at night and so I usually edit
till about like it's well vocal like at
night to be honest in the summer but hey
it's okay because the videos always
turned out better at night
and then I try to read a little bit at
night Fahrenheit 451 is one of my
favorite books this is like my third
time reading it but I love it and so I
don't always do this I try to but some
nights you know I just end up watching
Netflix cuz I'm lazy I recently started
a new girl and so I've been watching
that before I go to sleep which I know
is it the best habit but hey we all do
it so then I just watched that and I
usually go to bed at around eleven
twelve or even one o'clock depending on
what I'm feeling so I really hope you
