channel and you're like who the heck are
you my name is michelle rhee you should
stay if you guys watched my blog you
know that I have been super into working
out I love working out and I've been
working out consistently for like two
years now so I decided to throw together
a summer workout routine what I've been
doing lately I'm basically mixing
together clips of me actually working
out with me talking just so I cover all
my bases and don't forget anything I
want to talk this video by saying that I
am NOT a professional I am literally
eighteen years old this is just a stuff
that I have learned my tips what works
for me it might not necessarily work for
you I don't think you could help you if
you're trying to get on the bandwagon of
working out and being healthy I'm not
working out to lose weight I don't think
I need to lose weight there are parts of
my body then like yeah could be a little
bit better but I'm not trying to lose
weight I workout because it makes me a
positive person it makes me happy and
makes me producted a great way to start
my day and it just makes me feel really
good and I also get a little bit toned
in the process and so if that's what
you're looking for I think you clicked
on the right video so this our up this
video I just kind of talking about the
basics of my workout plan and then I'm
going to go into the actual like detail
of what I actually do at the gym with
like every little workout and all that
good stuff so I worked out five to six
days a week so I gave myself one and two
days to rest in between
I think birthdays are extremely
important and they're really really
vital if you want to keep going I also
work out in a gym so although all of
these clips are actually filmed outside
because I'm a little bit too shy to
actually like bring my DSLR to the gym I
have to be around other people to feel
motivated like whenever I'm running next
to someone I've got to feel like we're
racing I get really motivated I know a
lot of people just like to work out in
their room to workout videos and right
outside that just personally doesn't
work for me
so if you are like me I definitely
recommend joining a gym it really helps
for me and find sin and go to a gym I
don't feel like I would work out as much
I also split my workouts between cardio
and bodyweight exercises so I know a lot
of people are super into like just doing
weight training they think that's the
best way to go but for me running feels
so good I'm not really into like
bodybuilding and
really lifting heavy weights and doing
heavy squats like not that kind of stuff
so we started off this video we're
talking about my cardio routine that
I've been doing lately I like to run
three to four miles at 6 miles per hour
I'm trying to work up to running 5 to 6
miles by the end of August because my
mom runs five to six miles and she's I
went inspiration riding just feels
really good for me I find that like
whenever I finish like a 30-minute run
I'm just on like cloud nine so that's
what I do I think that's important find
what you enjoy doing and do it so that
is a cardio routine that I like to do if
I ran four miles a day before sometimes
I like to do two miles at 6 miles per
hour and then do 10 minutes on the
Stairmaster the Stairmaster is
definitely one of my favorite machines I
find that it works my legs and I burn
just as many calories as running on it
and if I don't feel like running 3 miles
I will switch off between running and
that and that if I just don't feel like
going for a long jog I will just do one
mile at 6 miles per hour and then I will
buy it for 20 minutes but not on the
bikes that you like lay down
unlike the spin bikes that you actually
have to sit up so I have to use my abs
but no matter what I do I always run
because running makes me feel good I
feel like that is the reason why I have
toned up my life a lot as I have been
running and so I would definitely
recommend it starting with legs I do one
leg exercise that I love it's my exit
I'll have it linked down below I've been
doing this exercise for like two years
now and it just works so well I have
seen such good results in it so she
might have but basically what it
consists of 50 lunches 25 on each leg
and I like to do with an 8 pound
medicine ball 50 pleeeease walks also
with an 8 pound medicine ball 25
standing leg raises which I know don't
look that hard if you add it with a
medicine ball it really really helps 25
calf raises on each leg also with the 8
pound medicine ball I like to do these
exercises with a medicine ball mainly
for balance I used to dance in high
school and I don't want to lose my
balance 20 leg raises on each leg so
basically I will lay down I will lift my
legs that really hurts the inner thigh
I also do scissors with my legs for like
two minutes
it's also really hurt your inner thighs
to do squats with an 8 pound medicine
ball by 5 fire hydrants on switch legs
like into a swim thing I'll show you
guys on point rocks
a little bit confusing explain that also
25 like life on this leg with a 20
second polls at the end guys this works
your legs it's like the best part of the
workout and then I will finish off with
a one-minute wall sit which truck me
waltz it's never ever get easy because
always really works that's all I did for
my legs
cover my out workouts to be honest Apps
has always been an area that I'm just
not that keeps it in I definitely have
trouble there ab workouts are always
difficult for me I just don't have a
strong core I always I push myself and
switch it off I do a ton of different
videos between Blogilates an exit I find
if I don't switch up my workout I'll get
used to them really fast so I usually
switch them up like once a week leg
workout let me do the same leg workout
and it just always hurts if I like
different weight abs I would have keep
it pushin up oh my favorite ABS things
to do our normal crunches Ultra crunches
bicycle crunches they always really hurt
people sit-ups with an 8 pound medicine
ball leg drop single leg drop ankle grab
elbows Denise it up your standard normal
plank twists plank oblique crunches
which are actually this candlestick one
I'll actually like crunches and also
oblique planks with pulses so for my
belt workout I also really really like
these blog allotting videos I think
house is awesome awesome awesome belt
workouts that are definitely my favorite
it's all my favorite moves to do your
standard squat with weight definitely
really work doing some hips for us also
help and all these are so awkward to
dealership I always feel so weird
whenever I do these but they work so
much expecially if you lift one leg and
do it girl they hurt so bad then I also
just like to do the leg lifts when I
showed my leg workout those also really
recruiting her arm workouts I don't have
a specific workout I do a ton of
different videos which I'll also link
down below I also don't really must show
them because I don't think I'm not
qualified I thought about arm workouts
because I'm just not that like great at
the top super into like season on my
arms I kind of just like to do it I just
want to talk about my go-to tips if
you're starting to get into working out
on what you eat it's always going to be
more important than your workout or what
you eat is true my vegetarian
also try to eat relatively clean and
healthy green and my mom makes great
food and I love me some sweet I have
special sweet too
so like yeah I don't always eat like
SuperDuper healthy but I think that
balance is important if you're not
always eating junk food balance is
really important listen to your body and
do what is fun if you hate runny then
don't run all about finding what
motivates you or what makes you feel
good
Stairmaster makes you feel like you're a
million dollars then like get them up
there after like that'll work
consistency is also the key you're
obviously results unless you keep doing
everything to simply to start with going
2 to 3 times a week and then work in two
maybe five to six times a week
also you don't think you need to lose
weight and most of you probably don't
need to lose weight don't work out to
lose weight work out because it makes
you feel good it makes you happy so
that's the end of this video let me know
down below what your favorite workout is
or your favorite workout person whatever
it may be I definitely love to hear also
