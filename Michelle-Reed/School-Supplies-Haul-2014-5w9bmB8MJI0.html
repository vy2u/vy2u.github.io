school supplies videos because it's like
everyone's organizational nerdiness of
uniting into one video and we all really
really enjoy these but I do want to note
I didn't buy everything I'm going to
need the school year because usually I
figure out exactly what I need on the
first day of school so I don't really
want to go out and buy a ton of stuff
that I'm not going to use because I
think that's just wasteful and I don't
really like wasting money I did buy the
things that I knew I was going to need
so I feared it was enough to do a school
supplies haul so let's just go ahead and
get into it so we got all the goods in
this bag so let's just go ahead and get
started so the first thing I bought was
a new agenda and it's just a Lilly
Pulitzer agenda which I know these are
super popular and stuff but I'm actually
not that organized believe it or not and
so I think if I bought a cute agenda
like this I would actually use it also
there's a ton of space to riot which is
great because I always have a ton of
homework first thing I bought was
another binder and this is just a teen
one-and-a-half inch one and I think I'm
going to put all my folders in this and
then some paper just so my folders don't
get ruined because they are paper
folders and I don't really like having a
ton of binders because then it just gets
really really bulky in my bag so I just
got one and I'm sure I'm gonna find a
use for this so for each class I like to
have a spiral notebook so the first one
I thought was this purple one and I
think I'm gonna use this for math as I
bought a folder to majid because I like
to match my folders in my notebooks and
I really like the 5 star brand so
basically everything I bought was the 5
star brand I also bought another one
subject green spiral and then I have a
folder to go with this as well and I
think I'm gonna use this for physics
because it's green and Grainger's
reminds me of science then let's see I
got three subject pink one and I think
I'm gonna use this for history because I
tend to take a whole lot of history
notes though athere
this will be great for history I didn't
buy anything for my English class just
because I don't know if I'm going to
need a composition book or spirals so I
just decided to kind of figure that out
on the first date
school thanks I got some college rolled
paper because I always run out of this
I'm always the kid that doesn't have
paper like that's me let's just be
honest here it's me so I got a pack and
I'll probably have to go through there
like ten of these but figure the one
what's enough for now now we're kind of
like the miscellaneous stuff Chris I
bought a pack of 300 index cards because
you guys know me I use these like
nobody's business
this will probably only last me like a
month but I love flashcards so I decided
to start off with a pack and I got some
highlighters these are just the Office
Depot ones I don't really like the
sharpie ones because they believe
through and so it has a whole bunch of
pretty colors so I decided to buy this
one and I like to annotate with these
for English I got a pack of 24 colored
pencils because again I'm always the kid
who doesn't have colored pencils because
I'm like why would any colored pencils
in high school but you know this year
I'm not gonna be that kid so I bought a
pack of 24 colored pencils next about a
pack of these paper mates
lead pencils which are crazy outrageous
and price but I love them because I have
terrible terrible handwriting and these
kind of make me write better I don't
know if that makes sense but they're
just like easier to write with and I
like them in they last long so I bought
a pack of these I have that is
everything that I bought so I know this
video is kind of short and I'm sorry but
I wanted to be able to show you guys
kind of how I organize once you get
deeper into the year that sounded really
weird once we get kind of farther along
in the year I will make sure to do an
organization video for you guys showing
how I like to keep all my stuff
organized in this video I like if you
absolutely love buying new school
supplies because I think everybody just
kind of enjoys it I don't know I'll go
ahead and see you guys in my next video
