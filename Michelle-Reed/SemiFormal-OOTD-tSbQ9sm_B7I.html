brandy melville my nails aren't painted
I know my rings from branding me
Melville and then I made this bracelet
by missglamorazzi zum do-it-yourself
video so my dress looks like this it's
just from Target it was like 25 dollars
it's just lace and short sleeve and it's
really really cute and I don't have
shoes on yet but I'm probably just gonna
wear sandals to kind of dress it down
because it's a picnic it's not supposed
to be like and then for perfume I just
wanted to show you guys I'm wearing my
viva la juicy perfume because this stuff
smells really nice yep that's it so I
