drugstore and sephora makeup all because
have never done one of these videos to
be completely honest I am such a nub you
to your room I know what I am really
been on this makeup kick lately where
I'm super into trying out new products
trying out new makeup looks all that
good stuff let me know what some of your
favorite products are right now because
like I said I've just really been into
makeup lately also give this video a
thumbs up if you like hulls either
clothing hauls or make Apollo's because
I love Paul's you Apollo's feet on the
poles and with all that being said let's
just go ahead and get into the video
that sephora i just got one thing and it
is the tarte amazonian clay full
coverage foundation and I've always
heard about this but never really tried
it out so decided to pick it up and I
got it in the shade fairlight honey but
this is a full coverage foundation and
it literally does feel like clay I
decided that I would try this out and
wear it for whatever I'm going out maybe
on a date or doing something fancy if I
wanted a little more full coverage this
is also very expensive so I'll
definitely get back to you guys on if
this is worth it or not because
typically I don't like to spend forty
dollars on a foundation but you know I
made an exception in the style also what
to target and I went in not really
looking for anything and I came out with
way too much makeup that I didn't need
like target is a black hole and it sucks
me and let me tell you picked up two
foundations to try this one is the
L'Oreal Paris infallible Pro matte
foundation I saw that Molly use this and
one of our recent videos decided that i
would pick it up so a nice consistency I
used it today and I feel like it did
wear off a little bit so now my
favorites but i think i will keep using
it and see if maybe there's a better
you use it also got the Ready Set
gorgeous fresh complexion foundation I
got this in the shade creamy natural and
seemed to be a very like a dewy fresh
foundation so excited to try this out
and I'll let you guys know if I like it
I picked up the HR I'm brightener I love
this I've always wanted to try it and I
use it today and I can tell you it
definitely brightened up my face I have
very dark under eye circles so this
really helped just bring some light into
my face and I really like it I've also
always wanted to try bronzer so I picked
up two from target this one is the pixie
bronzer in subtly Sun touched a very
nice brown like it is not orangi at all
which i think is great so you can see
right here kind of looks orange because
I put it over the foundation but I run
off this I also picked up the Rimmel
natural bronzer in sunlight this one
looks a little orange here to be
completely honest so that's it right
there but I mean it was a lot cheaper
like more than ten dollars cheaper so I
will let you guys know if this is good I
haven't really tried it out again though
I also got an elf powder brush it's just
the flat top brush I really like this
it's super dense and great quality i
think i bought this like three times
because i continuously lose it i don't
know why i have a problem so office
again I always said money but it's a
great point so i'll actually send me a
ton of laura geller products which i
thought i would show you guys because
they are pretty nice I have three of
these laura geller love me do lip
crayons this one's in the shade
cranberry glaze and it's just a nice
like red raspberry color this one is
watermelon cooler and it seems to be
more of like a bubble gum pink kind of
color then the last one is lychee glass
AI definitely said that wrong I'm so
sorry but it is more of like an orange
coral color and overall really like the
formula of these there's two
are pigmented and moisturizing so I
think they're great for like the spring
and summertime so not to lip liners this
one is in the shade of Ruby so it's a
nice typical red color I also have this
nude one which I've really been digging
I've used a ton of it if you can see
which is your typical standard lip
pencil as I have two of the baked duos
this one is in the shade pink icing
devil's food so it's a nice like purpley
green and then a brown and then this one
is in a row Milan really really like
this one this gold white color is great
for a highlight I've been using it for
that and I really like it I also have
the glam blush dramatic volumizing
mascara this one is pretty nice i think
i'm going to repurchase this after it
dries out because it volumizes yet
separates your lashes at the same time
which is something that you don't really
get from a mascara usually so i really
really like this and i would definitely
suggest chickens lastly i have some
smashbox products to show you guys this
one is the double exposure palette
really really like this because there is
both like warm colors and then there
also cool colors so you have a nice like
array of shapes to use and they're super
pigmented i love them i also have the
photo finish primer water and to be
completely honest I've never tried
primer water but it's kind of a cool
concept you just sprayed on before you
apply your makeup it really does the job
and keeps your makeup on I have two
eyeliners this one is the plum one this
is a smoke these are the gel eyeliners
which I really been liking lately
because they're easy to put on however
the smoke one it just kind of looks like
you're wearing eyeliner that isn't dark
enough you know what I mean whenever you
buy eyeliner it's not super block that's
what this one reminds me of so not my
favorite shade but I really like the
consistency of these so that was all the
makeup that I have to show you guys I
hope you guys enjoyed this like always
don't forget to suggest some of your
favorite products lately because I
need an excuse to buy more right yes
right elbe you are having a great day
night morning whenever you're watching
this I'll see you guys in my next video
