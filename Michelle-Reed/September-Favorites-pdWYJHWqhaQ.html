favorites I know it's really late but I
decided better late than never
sorry the line is kind of weird it's
really cloudy outside today but how does
decide whatever episode me go ahead and
do this first I wanted to be the flirt
I'm moose in sandcastle and this is what
it looks like it's like this shimmery
kind of champagne alert it's so pretty
just all over the lids my sisters but
I'm going to get some next time I go to
Cole's but it looks like that and it's
so pretty and I have it on today
underneath my eye shadow which I will
get into later Disney covergirl nature
luxe foundation probably medium coverage
but it feels so like flying and I'm
wearing it today I feel it I just feel
like nothing today my face it feels like
nothing and I've been using my covergirl
shimmering sands palette and this is my
sister she like never uses this so I
just couldn't take it
and they're just these SuperDuper sherry
colors those are them right there really
likes washed out bring them today and I
love them if you guys wanted tutorial
then shirt a chapstick it's the Burt's
Bees they pepper any kind so this was
just pepper hit yet I have a plush girl
on cream blush and very flirtatious and
I hate house compliment this ugly mom
like great everybody looks like that is
the exact color I like it is the color
of my walls right there and I love this
so much this little button and it shoots
out of your like is that so awesome it's
actually a lipstick by Clinique
and it is in a different grade
in Syria you guys are gonna be like whoa
I've never seen you wear that before but
it looks like this I'm not wearing this
like straight out of - I tried that once
I was like okay I look like a different
person
the only things they like take my finger
and dab it and then like lightly I put
this on my lips and it's so pretty
like just hurt more of like a natural
dark look I guess but if you want to
wear this okay well it looks like that
under perfumes I just have one this is
the e Brush Company Inc one it's the
double body mist
yah-ha guys I've learned this so much
clothes know everything smells like this
it's like a bakery to sell this if they
do I would totally recommend it
puzzling in here that says that they
still sell us I don't know I think they
do have not touched any of my other
perfumes except for this one so now I
have like two candles and I've really
been liking for fall oops
Sookie met I met Jordan who love is
going to be watching this right now
because he was going through my clips
earlier laughing and it's all talking
about candles so you know I don't know
if you're watching this you are the
first artists remain kinky and old it
looks like this and it's in buttercream
so so good it's like vanilla but it has
a little bit of a different taste and
taste yeah like I would eat this I need
out of this but it smells spicy the
second one is from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and
it's homemade cookies okay it smells
better when you actually like smelling
it make sure you burn it has been about
this weird after smell after taste can
you if like after smells good
everybody else likes it on YouTube yeah

my iPod so I can show you guys my
favorite song and I totally know what it
