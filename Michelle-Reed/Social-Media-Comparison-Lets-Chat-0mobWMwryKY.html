that is very unexpected and I didn't
actually plan on doing today I had a
back-to-school hairstyles video that I
was gonna do but honestly I just felt
compelled to talk to you guys about
something that I wanted to talk about
for a while and to be completely honest
I don't really know what I'm going to
talk about there's just a lot of things
on my mind that I felt that I need to
speak on and so that's what I'm doing
today basically what I'm talking about
in this video is kind of this age of
social media and comparison and having
kind of a quote perfect life and the
pressure that it has put on me
personally I'm in no way saying social
media is bad at all I think it's such a
great platform and it's such a great way
to grow and connect with people and I
think it's incredible but there are a
lot of times where it can create
unhealthy perceptions of people's lives
and I guess that's more what I'm talking
about today basically how I have
compared myself to other people on
social media and how sometimes I will
look at someone and be like wow their
life is great my life is so not even
comparable to theirs I've struggled with
this a lot especially in the past year I
can say and it's not really something
that I wanted to come out and say
because I feel like nowadays we need to
give off the image that we're living
these happy you know bubbly perfect
lives and we're always doing really cool
things and we're never lonely and we're
always happy and if I can just be
completely honest with you guys that has
not been how it's been lately especially
this summer I've been working so hard on
my YouTube videos I'm grateful that I
have been it's taught me a lot but I
have grown a little bit lonely if I can
say I just haven't been the happiest and
I feel like the best that I've been and
sometimes I will watch my videos and
I'll see this image that I'm portraying
and I'm like that's not really how
things have been it breaks my heart when
I see you comment when it's like I want
to be you you're my life goals you have
the perfect relationship the perfect
family the perfect friends and honestly
guys that
not how it's been my relationship I
fight with my boyfriend sometimes and
sometimes we disagree and sometimes I
want to rip his head off and that's life
sometimes I don't feel like working out
I spend way too much money on clothes
than I probably should and it breaks my
heart seeing these comments and I know
they're meant to be compliments but my
life is not perfect and it hasn't been I
feel like we go on social media and we
just think wow these people have their
lives together and they are the perfect
things and just know that social media
is not a representation of someone's
life
people are gonna put their best self
forward on their social media because
you know you want to do that if someone
comes across your Instagram page that
maybe wants to do a business opportunity
with you they don't want to see these
crappy photos of a subpar life they want
to see someone who's gonna motivate
people and inspire people I think social
media is kind of like an art gallery
you're gonna work on a lot of different
paintings but you're gonna put the best
ones out there because say someone was
to come and purchase one of them from
you you don't want to put the crappy
stuff out there and I think it's just so
important for young girls and young men
even to know that that's not the whole
picture and sometimes people go through
rough patches and sometimes people go
through parts of their lives that aren't
necessarily happy a positive and bubbly
and I just been tired of putting out
this image where I look like I have it
all going together and I look like
everything is going for me because it's
not all so I'm getting ready to go to
college in a year and if I can be
completely honest I have no idea what I
want to do I don't know where I want to
go and it is stressing me out I have
friends who are working on college
applications and know their dream
schools and but I'm just sitting here
like and it's scary and it's something
that I have been praying a lot about and
just asking God for guidance and I don't
want to waste four years of my life
somewhere where I'm not going to get a
good education and it's stressful and so
what I can say in this video and the
point I'm trying to make is if you are
comparing yourself to other people on
social media are on YouTube stop I think
it's great to recognize other people's
success and their strengths and that's
so important and that's such a good
quality to have
but don't ever make yourself feel worse
about yourself just because someone else
is putting their best foot forward I
feel like sometimes being on YouTube you
can be put on a pedestal and you can
look like you have a perfect life
because you're meant to motivate people
and I understand that I understand
people come home whenever they're having
a bad day and they want to see a
positive uplifting video but sometimes
it's just not the case and if you are
watching this video right now and you
are struggling with self-worth in
comparison stop sometimes in life we go
through rough patches and we kind of
remain stagnant for a while and that's
okay you need those times to get
motivated and feel better about yourself
but you don't always have to be on it'll
always have to be positive and happy and
uplifting it's okay to go through times
when things aren't going good and if you
can be honest they're going terrible
also if you're out there and you're
comparing yourself to other people's you
know appearances inside you were created
to be your own person and if you are
different and you feel less because
someone else looks better than you don't
feel that way and better yet don't bring
other people down because you may think
that they look better than you you were
meant to be your own person and you were
not meant to be like anyone else around
you and so embrace that and I feel like
this video is going all over the plates
but what I'm trying to say is that
social media is not everything people's
lives are not always as they seem on the
internet and it's so important to learn
that with this age of social media and
technology and all that stuff and I
guess I just want to admit to you guys
my life hasn't been going so swell but
that is okay it is okay not to be okay I
also wanted to address the fact that I
changed my channel name to my name which
is Michelle Reed and a lot more upset
about that but I have planned this for
the past six months and it is just so
exciting to me to finally get to do this
realize my old channel name ended up as
an accident when I first started my
videos my sister and so I felt like it
was time to change that she's going to
college and she doesn't make videos with
me anymore and the name was hard to
remember
and I just kind of wanted things to get
more personal and to actually change it
to my name so that is the reason why I
did that also I feel like I've been
making content that wasn't really me and
so with this channel name change I
really want to make content that better
represents myself not videos that I
think you guys will like to see which is
important to do every once in a while
but things that I genuinely want to show
you guys I'm actually really it's a
video honor if you don't know when I
like capturing moments around me rather
than just myself all the time and so I
really want to start doing that more and
just making my channel mine I know I
made this video really dramatic and I'm
sorry I just wanted you guys to know
that I am struggling sometimes and it's
okay and life goes on I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video and I truly hope
that it helps you if you are struggling
with the same things that I've been
struggling with for a while
and just know life goes on and things
looking better also if you want to watch
my last video it was actually
back-to-school hole and I got to show
you some super cute pieces like the one
I am wearing right now which I love so
you should definitely go check out that
one and I'll see you guys in my next
video which will be a back-to-school
video not something dramatic like this
yeah hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
