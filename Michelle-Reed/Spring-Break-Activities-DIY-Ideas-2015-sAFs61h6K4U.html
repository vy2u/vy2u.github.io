have absolutely nothing to do but wait
ello friends today I am here to do a
spring break activities kind of video I
know a lot of you guys don't live in
like super hot and sunny places so I
decided to make some of these activities
more for places at our little colder or
maybe it's rainy like it was here but I
also included a few for you lucky people
who have sunny climates just so we could
all enjoy spring break and have
activities geared towards us this is
actually a collab with my friend Kenzie
on YouTube and she is doing spring break
essential items so you should definitely
go watch her video and subscribe to her
channel she's awesome I will have
everything linked down below go check
her out she's awesome and also give this
video a like if you are currently on
spring break or you're going to be or
you like spring break and with all that
said let's just go ahead and get into
the video
so one thing that I love to do for the
springtime is get really involved with
YouTube since on break I usually have a
lot more time to film and I find there's
a lot of videos to do because you have
prom coming up you have spring tutorials
everyone's just wanting to try new
things I also like to learn about new
brands which I get to do through a
company called grapevine grapevine
basically links you to different brands
to do sponsorships on YouTube basically
just make an account online but they do
have to approve you to make sure you
have the minimums that they require but
it's a super easy process and then you
can just scroll through those campaigns
and apply for them and then you can do
those and make money it's honestly just
such an easy program to use like I
cannot emphasize that enough I'm really
leery to do business opportunities of
companies that I don't know just because
you never know if you're gonna be ripped
off like honestly you can be taken
advantage of so easily but grapevine is
not that kind of person they are awesome
the communication was fabulous they
email you in a timely manner with all
the stuff that you need to include in
your video there to the points but they
include enough information it's not
something that you're gonna have to read
through this super long contract and get
like a lawyer to sit with you because
that is not fun also a great thing is
you get paid fast and I'm not lying here
because sometimes I will be stuff of
companies and it takes months to get my
payment and that's just sketchy you no
one wants to go through that they
actually have like a same-day policy
know so I haven't tried that out yet but
apparently that's a new thing so there's
actually a match feature now so you can
be paired with another channel to do a
collaboration with which is awesome and
I think you should check that out I
haven't personally used that yet so I
can't really say how I like it but that
is a pretty cool thing so if you're
interested and you actively make videos
I will link it down below it should be
like the first link in the description
to where you can sign up I think that's
everything I have to say so try out
grapevine a little bit and let's go on
to the next point so the first thing
that I'd love to do is some spring
cleaning cuz my room can get messy and
spring is really the time to just kind
of clean everything vacuum organize get
your life back together it's really
cliche but it's honestly the perfect
time because
everything's getting warmer you know
everything's changing so you might as
well change up your room and I also like
to put some flowers in my room because
even if it's cloudy and gross outside
you can still have some pretty flowers
in your room I also love to sell my
clothes so basically I will go through
my closet and pick out anything that I'm
not really wearing and I'll just put it
in a bag and take it to my favorite
clothing resale shop which is close
mentor are not sponsored or anything I
just love them they actually have super
cute clothes to buy and they always buy
my clothes so this is a great way to
make money and I do this probably every
season so I definitely recommend it and
you can also find some really cute
clothes but not these red pants I just
try it on
and you know you have to reward yourself
with some Starbucks because it's just a
given now if it is warmer where you live
I would suggest going on a picnic I
absolutely love picnics there's so much
fun if you want to bring a couple
friends and I'm also gonna be showing
you guys how to make your own passion
tea lemonade from Starbucks but a lot
cheaper so let's get into it all you're
going to need is some simply lemonade
some passion tea some vanilla extract
and some sugar and that is it so I just
boiled a quarts of water because I was
making a few servings and I totally miss
and this was so embarrassing obviously I
don't spend that much time in the
kitchen but I will have the exact recipe
down below but then I just put the tea
packets in the vanilla the sugar and let
it sit for about 15 minutes and then I
poured it into a little pitcher I then
just put this in the fridge for an hour
to let it cool down and then poured it
over ice and added a little bit of
lemonade I don't know the exact amount
but I just kind of did it to where it
tastes so good and that was it for this
drink so for my picnic I just went and
grabbed some Subway sandwiches and some
chips so it was really cheap and I just
have my little lemonade and it was
really fun we actually had a sunny day
on spring break which we hadn't had in a
while so I was so stoked and this is my
favorite part it's so pretty and
honestly this was probably my favorite
thing I did over spring break
so that's the end of this video I really
hoped you guys enjoyed this and maybe
this helped you out a little bit like I
said do not forget to go check out
Kenzie's video linked in the down bar
and subscribe to our Channel and I guess
I'll see you guys my next video bye I
love you guys so much
