I recently just did one but you know it
happened and I bought some stuff in my
supposed to make video right so first
I'm just gonna talk about some stuff
that I ordered from etsy I'm the first
one being the necklace that I'm wearing
it's just one of these like bauble
necklaces and it's so pretty it's just a
cream color I know it's not like
everybody's style but i really like it i
think it's really cute typically if you
bought a necklace like this from jake
would be like a hundred and fifty
dollars i found this on etsy for twenty
bucks like it also came with this free
necklace which i'm not really digging to
tell you guys the truth it looks like
this but it was free so yeah but i don't
really plan on wearing this i also
ordered a couple rings from another shop
the first one is this initial ring that
is what it looks like it's so pretty
it's just a silver initial ring and it
looks like this i also order this
infinity ring it's just a little
infinity sign so then i went to my
favorite store H&amp;amp;M and i purchased a few
things these are both pretty like basic
things but i got a short sleeve shirt
for springtime it looks like this is
just short sleeve and i don't know if
you can tell but has really small like
little colorful splotches in it it's
really cute nice and simple shirt i
really love my basic shirts and it just
looks like that i also got another one
of my favorite basic shirts if you saw
in my last haul video i got to these
shirts and i got another one cuz i love
them so much this one is just a striped
long sleeve sweet this is striped a long
sleeve sure it's just black and kind of
oatmeal color it looks like that i also
purchase another striped shirt from
forever 21 i want to say remember 21 has
really cute spring clothes right now if
you're interested um I wanted to buy
like everything but I got this shirt
navy and white striped um just kind of
sheer flowy top but short sleeves it
kind of looks weird unless it's on but
it looks like that then I got a few
pairs of shorts i'm really excited it's
really warm where i live right now it's
like 70 degrees so i can basically start
to wear shorts almost so I got a few
pairs the first pair of looks like this
is just khaki and it has like an aqua
bow they look like
this these parent I really like these
there polka dots and they are like flowy
kind of shorts if you know what I mean
these are so free and comfortable and I
want to wear these right now but they're
black you might poke it out and they
come with a little belt and they are
super duper cute and the last pair i got
was just a simple denim pair i like
these because they're not super short
because i'm not into the whole like
abercrombie super duper short shorts i
really like these look like this so
they're nice and cute and they're a
little bit distressed and I really like
them so I had a forty percent off coupon
for american eagle so i bought a couple
pairs of jeans these are just the skinny
jeans so I just got a black pair because
I don't have any black skinny jeans I
also got another pair of the ones I'm
wearing right now they look like this
these are so comfortable these are
skinny but they're not jegging so they
feel like jeggings they're just a really
really dark wash and they look like that
and I just love these jeans they're so
comfortable wear these like every day
and I just needed a simple like white
tank top for part of a costume I know
it's an anthropology and I never buy
stuff from anthropology but this is so
cute and I wanted to put it in my room
so it is a vase but it's so pretty it's
like blue and it has this really pretty
flower on it I felt like this is really
pretty for spring just to add a little
spring touch to my room so that was
everything that I bought and i hope you
guys enjoy this and make sure to leave
your video response of any haul videos
that you've done recently and i'll see
you guys my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
