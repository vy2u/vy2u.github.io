exciting video it is going to be my
spring hole which can we just take like
a minute of silence recognize that I
haven't done a whole since black friday
which was in November I really just
haven't been shopping lately honestly
I've just been spending my money on
other things but spring is my favorite
season and I had to do some shopping so
yeah is it like a ton of stuff to show
you guys so I'm going to do a try on
haul just so you guys can kind of see
what these things actually look like so
really hope you guys enjoy this and
let's just go ahead and get into the
video so recently I went to urban
outfitters and I got this r offers kind
of an impulse buy but happy I did it
just this blue boxy romper it has kind
of a crinkly material I don't really
know how to describe it but it's super
shapeless and then the shorts look like
this honestly not that flattering but
sometimes you just want to throw
something on that's comfy and you can
wear not have to worry about it really
like this my bank account did not like
it but I did I also stopped at marshalls
a few days ago just because I thought
I'd look around and see if I like
anything and I actually liked three
things the first thing is actually what
I'm going to wear the beautycon which is
in like two days that I'm so excited but
it's just this kind of coral color
romper it has scallops sleeves and then
the shorts on it are also scallops this
is only twenty dollars which is awesome
and it also covers my butt which is a
plus in the main thing I'm looking
forward I by rompers I also purchased
this black dress which I was going to
wear but then I decided not to but I
think I'm still going to keep it it's
just this very long straight dress that
is a little bit lower in the back it
also has kind of see-through mesh
cutouts like right here and then the
back back is all mesh I really like this
and again it was only twenty dollars so
check out Marshalls if you're in need of
close lastly I got this dress and it's
just a straight dress with a ton of
beige color polka dots on it I really
like this but I think I might return it
it's just very shapeless it doesn't
really do anything for me there's also
forty dollars which is kind of expensive
or something like this I don't know you
guys should let me know if you think I
should return that or not also stopped
by a j.crew actually yesterday and I
picked up some spring things I got two
pairs of shorts and these are just these
kind of like linen shorts with a
stretchy waistband and they look like
this they're not too short but they're a
good length these are so comfortable
they are like 10 times better than the
chino shorts cuz they are so comfy I got
a navy pier and I also got this blue
color which is my favorite I'm really
excited to wear these I would definitely
recommend trying them out I also got a
blouse that looks like this it's just
short sleeved and then the bottom has
kind of more scallops detailing they
also had this in like a hot pink and a
mate green I just thought Navy would go
more what I have up to H&amp;amp;M to get a few
shirts for the spring time I got this
kind of plain striped tee it's just long
sleeved and kind of flowy but still
tight don't really know how to describe
it it's obviously the simplest t-shirt
but it looks so flattering like let me
know if you guys have a shirt that is so
simple but it's a sure that you're
always wearing cuz it looks good I feel
like this is going to be my shirt I also
got this T which I really like it has
blue and black flowers on it and it's
really flowy on the bottom and it just
has kind of a crew neck I can already
see me wearing this with like black
jeans and some cute booties and maybe
like a black hat or something I just
think it'd be very very cute for the
springtime and the last thing i got is
this tribal pattern t it just has kind
of black and white there's a name for
this pattern but i can't think of it but
just kind of like a tribal pattern and
super flowy on the bottom I felt like
all super flowy things which I don't
normally do so not really sure how I'm
going to style this yeah but I know it's
gonna come in handy when I just want to
throw something on I also needed some
new jeans so I stopped by american eagle
one eye on a couple pairs these ones are
super out of my comfort zone cuz i don't
really wear black wash jeans but for
some reason i really like these they're
just a very like light blue wash so not
too white like they're a good shade i
think and these are just the American
Eagle jeggings they're not like high
rise or anything they're just there are
you are jeggings I also have this pair
which is more the kind that I usually
wears like a very dark wash almost black
but still blue I really really need a
new jeans so super stoked to sort
Brandis I also got the cutest pair of
heels from dillards they're just
cream-colored tiny little heels and
these are the comfiest shoes I own like
whenever I was trying these on I like
walked around the store forever send it
won't take them off I'm gonna wear these
to be be calm with my proper and I'm so
excited I really love these shoes and
then also from dylan's I got this
necklace it has little pearls it is very
simple and dainty this is on sale for
like 18 dollars I think so I just
thought this would look good with my
romper and my heels to kind of tie
together my own and then lastly I just
got a couple of beauty products that i
thought i'd show you guys cuz i'm loving
them the first one is this Maybelline
lipstick and blissful Barry a really
pretty kind of like purpley pink color
and I love this brand of lipstick like
this line is great they're so smooth and
okay
I love this it's the perfect bari that's
still pretty subtle it's not like super
intense like my rebel lipstick from Mac
I also had a product that I was eyeing
forever every time I go to the grocery
store see Revlon Colorstay moisture
staying in the shade parsi and passion
Percy and passion that's literally the
same color but this is like a lip stain
and a gloss in one so usually when you
get lip stains they're really really dry
they'll make it looks like cracked and
gross but this moisturizes and it gives
it a great gloss finish and I love this
these products rock and I'm so happy
that I tried it out that's everything
that I have to show you guys I hope you
guys enjoyed this I really enjoyed
filming this hall for you guys because I
honestly have it filmed one in so long
and I'm missing let me know you are most
excited about for the spring time
because it is fast approaching and it's
my favorite season and I love it ah but
i guess i'll see you guys in my next
video hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
