three different neighborhoods in New
York City chillin it apart right now
because I thought this is here might be
a little bit more fun here each one of
these outfits actually kind of matches
the vibe of these neighborhoods in and I
my boyfriend actually really enjoyed
exploring around the city and so we also
included three of our favorite places
around here so if you're ever in town
you should definitely check them out
also if you've ever been in New York
City definitely let me know down below
what your favorite place is because
they're always looking at buying new
places and agree you should only
subscribe the button is down below so
let's just go ahead and get right into
the video
so the first neighborhood is the Upper
East Side I absolutely loved Upper East
Side and agent as well because you go to
church around here and it's always
really really nice my skirt is from
Nordstrom and my top is from 2020 of and
then I'm just wearing these shoes which
are Naturalizer and I'm wearing my purse
which I've been loving recently is from
Angelo Roy it's so black and classy and
sleek and I just really really love it
it's also vegan leather so if you guys
are vegan it's such a great option I'll
have it linked down below but I'm
wearing it with all the outfits in this
video our favorite place is actually
this little cafe called Kurata on
Lexington at East 70th Street I have so
many cute just pastries and sandwich and
the coffee here is so so good so I would
definitely recommend it if you need to
just stop by somewhere we love the brief
sandwiches and the spinach pies they are
so so good the West Village is also
another super super cute neighborhood I
absolutely love it here I mainly really
like it because there are really great
parks around here and all the flowers
are out right now so it's so pretty my
dress that I'm wearing is from Zara and
my jean jacket is from choies which is
basically just a wholesale fashion
website and then my shoes are from call
it spring I love pairing dresses and
tennis shoes here in New York City I
just think it gives are really really
cute for you vibe if you guys are fans
of really cute stationery there is a
place called pink all oh just right
across from Charles Street and McCarthy
Square it's really really cute it's
called pink olive and they have really
cute cards and prints I love prints for
my wall and so I think the store is
really really cute it also just has
really really nice little
notebooks and stuff which I know a lot
of people are into right now in our last
place that we like is Battery Park City
I love this because the trail is very
very beautiful you have such a pretty
view of the skyline and all the flowers
are blooming right now so it's
absolutely beautiful
through my outfit my top is from 20/20
AB I love how it's a little bit longer
and I just paired it with some black
skinny jeans and then for shoes I'm
wearing these shoes which are from zoo
shoe I also just threw on this little
old Navy bandanna I think it's really
cute and it just adds a pop of color
since I am wearing a ton of black which
kind of happens when you live in New
York City everyone wears black all the
time so it kind of just happens but I
love a solve it for spring because my
hair is out of my face our favorite
place in Battery Park City is probably
just the trail that goes by it's really
great if you're into running or just
going on walks or working out outside
and we really hope you guys enjoyed it
