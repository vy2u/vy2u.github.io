get this sweat proof / waterproof summer
makeup tutorial whether you are outside
of the pool or in this is a great summer
makeup tutorial for you guys hope you
enjoy so first I'm just pulling my hair
back and just clipping it and taking my
Maybelline BB cream and I'm gonna apply
this to my face I like it because it has
SPF and it's not too thick for summer so
I'm just blending this in with my knock
off beauty blunder then I'm taking my
age rewind concealer or applying this
under my eyes I know this probably won't
stay on if you go under water but if
you're just wearing makeup throughout
the day I think this is a great
concealer and then I'm taking my NYX
boho chic cream blush and applying this
to my cheeks this actually stays on very
long and I would definitely recommend it
for some hot days so I'm not doing any
powder eyeshadow but I am going to take
my maybelline color tattoo and edgy
emerald I'm just applying this to my
lower lash line from the outer lash line
to the like halfway mark of my eye like
this because it's a nice pop of color
and this is definitely waterproof this
is probably the most waterproof thing I
use and then I just set that with an
aqua eye shadow and then took my NYX
jumbo eye shadow and sparkly nude and
I'm applying this to the inner corner
and to the blue this is actually more of
a bronze than a nude and I really liked
it as well so then I'm just curling my
eyelashes and applying my favorite
waterproof mascara which is the
Maybelline rocket Volume Mascara it
seriously amazing and it definitely
stays on in the water or trust in the
heat so that is it for the eyes and for
lips I'm taking my Revlon kissable balm
stain in sweetheart and we're playing
this to my lips and really shearing it
out just with my fingers and with a
tissue and taking my baby lips in
grapevine and applying this for some SPF
and
so that's the end of this makeup
tutorial it's nice and simple and good
for summer so this is just a an outfit
that I wore on a summer day it's a
crochet tank top from american eagle it
all looks like this is nice and cute i'm
just wearing these shorts which i made
in a DIY video which i'll link below but
they're from goodwill and then my
sandals are just from american eagle so
i hope you guys enjoyed this little
summer makeup tutorial whether you are
in the pool or out I know it's not
completely waterproof but if you just
feel the need to wear makeup in the pool
this is what I suggest bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
