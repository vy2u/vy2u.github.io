which I haven't done in a while but my
vlog channel you guys always request
that I do this tutorial it's a very
pretty just peachy cold fresh and very
glowy summer look and so I figured it
was perfect for summer and so I wanted
to show you guys I just want to note
this is not the summer makeup tutorial
that consists of like two products it's
quite a bit of makeup so I think this is
better for maybe if you have a summer
party you're going to or just kind of
like an event or something this is nice
but it's definitely not as natural as
you would want in the summertime if you
live somewhere that's really hot if you
haven't named you to my channel and you
stumbled across this video you should
definitely subscribe the buttons right
here and I upload it twice a week and
this officially starts my summer videos
so subscribe for more summer videos and
let's just go ahead and get into the
video so I just applied my coconut oil
moisturizing cream I really like this
it's really gonna give your face that
dewy look really recommending this up I
usually use it I am in the morning now
I'm going to be mixing a couple of
foundations and moisturizers I'm using
my simple moisturizer eye makeup forever
HD foundation and then also my Ready Set
gorgeous foundation these two together
kind of give me the perfect color and
I'm adding the moisturizer just again to
give that dewy look and I'm just using
my Beauty butter
then I'm just going into doing very soft
brows I'm not the kind of person that
really likes like really intense brows
so we're just gonna go in I honestly
don't really have a technique I kind of
just go for it I know I'm the worst but
super eyes I'm just going in with my
instant age rewind concealer and I'm
just going to put this on my eyelids to
kind of neutralize them and to ensure
that it doesn't crease I'm just going to
go in with a little bit of translucent
powder that's that then I'm going in
with my Kat Von D shade and light
palette I love this palette I'm going in
with this super pretty peach color right
here I'm obsessed with it and I'm using
a very fluffy blending brush I'm just
gonna apply this in the crease not
really thinking about it it's kind of
just a transition color after that is
finished I'm going in with kaya a more
tapered blending brush and I'm taking
this maroon burgundy shade peanut very
lightly because this color is pretty
intense and I'm going to work that into
the very very crease of my eye and just
kind of letting it define it there then
I'm going in with a flat brush and I'm
just going to spray this with a little
bit of setting spray then I'm using my
lorac Gold palette actually my sister's
palette and I'm taking the shade
unlimited right here it's a very pretty
warm gold color I'm applying this to my
lid
then I'm going back game with that
maroon shape I'm going to apply it with
a skinnier pencil brush just to kind of
define it a little more then from the
shade and light palette I'm taking the
kind of yellow highlight color and I'm
going to play this under my brow bone so
now for my favorite part of the routine
I'm gonna go in with my concealer and
I'm going to be baking because I really
like how it looks I'm using the instant
age rewind concealer it's the
brightening wand applying this like your
typical V motion and I'm kind of
swooping it up to clean up all that
excess eye shadow that kind of went down
then I'm just gonna go ahead and apply
this on my chin and my forehead I don't
like to fight on my nose just because I
find makeup really kicks up on my nose
then I'm just blending this out summer
powder I'm using my botanics
lighter-than-air mineral loose powder I
love this it's great for the summer
because it's so light and it doesn't
look cakey at all and it just feels
really really great on your skin I'm
just going to apply this underneath my
eyes
now I'm just gonna let that sit here for
about ten minutes or so and then I'll
get back to you guys so it's been about
ten minutes so I'm gonna go ahead and
just wipe off all this excess powder now
at a time for bronzer and I'm using my
hoola bronzer this is honestly the only
bronzer I ever use just because it's so
good so I'm going to go ahead and use
this on kind of a tapered brush like so
also applying this to my temples never
blush I'm using my Clinique blush in the
shade sunset glow it's just a very
pretty warm toned blush this for a
highlight I'm using Mac soft and gentle
and I'm just lightly gonna put this on
my cheekbones and not really good like
too crazy with it and I'm just going
back into my eyes and I'm applying a
thin line of eyeliner with my Maybelline
Line stiletto eyeliner and then I'm just
curling my eyelashes and applying my
rocket mascara
so since I feel like my body is a lot
Tanner than my face I'm gonna go in with
my Vita liberar de face tan our mineral
power just lightly pick up a little bit
of this and really dust it off and I'm
just going to apply this to my face
our lips I'm using my Revlon HD matte
lip color in the shade seduction it's a
really pretty kind of warm tone nude and
then lastly I'm using my Smashbox photo
finish primer water and I'm going to
apply this to my face so I really hope
you guys enjoyed this make a tutorial
maybe got a tip or two about how to do
your makeup in the summertime because I
definitely think this is a very pretty
look and I've been wearing it all the
time over on my blog Trina which is the
shell out of her shell if you're
wondering you should also go watch my
last video was all about my self tanning
routine so how I got this tan which is
not natural it is self tanner so you
should definitely go watch that video if
you're in the market for that and I'll
see you guys in my next video bye
