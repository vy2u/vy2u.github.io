for this video because it is my summer
morning routine for 2016 I haven't done
a morning routine in such a long time as
I decided just to do this video for you
guys because I know you all love these
so very much I also wanted to say that
I'm working with a super cool watch
brand in this video and the brand is
called Yoda it is a Swedish brand and I
absolutely love their watches and they
were so so kind and decided to let me do
it giveaway for you guys so make sure
you say till the end so you can see the
giveaway and I also have some really
speak coupon codes you'll see more of
the watches in the video but I just
wanted to let you guys know that there
is a giveaway so definitely stay tuned
to the end because you're gonna want to
have your own free watch from this brand
because they're so cool also like always
if you are new to my channel you should
definitely subscribe the buttons right
here and I think this video is a pretty
good taste of what my videos are like so
if you enjoy it definitely subscribe I
upload on Thursdays and Sundays and I'm
pretty sure that's everything that I
really have to tell you guys so let's
just go ahead and get into the morning
routine so in summertime I typically
wake up at around 9 o'clock I just kind
of naturally wake up when my body wants
to and then I will head to make my bed
because I always make my bed even in the
summertime I just have to to start my
day and then I'll go over to the
bathroom and I'll brush my teeth because
I always have to start my day by washing
my teeth as well and then I'll go back
in my room and I will grab my books I
always like to read in the morning so
I'm currently reading recovering
redemption by Matt Chandler and then
I'll go make a nice cup of coffee and
take that onto the porch to read and
journal I love taking this time in the
morning just to kind of read something
and write in my journal I think it's
really important and it's a great way to
start your day rather than sitting on
social media and looking at other
people's pictures I just think it's
better for your own creativity and
productivity to just read in the morning
so then I will grab my stuff and I'll
head back out of the patio
then I will go wash my face and I will
take a shower I should just take about a
five or 10 minute shower really quick in
the morning and I'll just apply my Samba
foot fetish cream and my Brazilian bum
bum cream I'm not being sponsored to say
this but these products are so good I'll
have them linked down below they really
moisturize your skin and I love to apply
these after shower they smell great then
you go ahead in the kitchen and I'll
make some pancakes so I'm combining oats
almond milk a banana and some cinnamon
and honey and this makes it really kind
of healthier pancake batter that's
really really tasty so just blend that
up and I will put it in my skillet and I
will make some pancakes I'm not that
great at making them or flipping them
but they're really good and they're
healthier so if you're looking for
something that is a little better for
you definitely try this it's great with
some honey on top so I just enjoyed
these pancakes in the morning I'm the
kind of person that has to make
something big and filling in the morning
girls I cannot get through my days so I
love breakfast and then I'll head in my
room and I'll start getting ready I'll
just do my typical kind of makeup
routine I've done so many makeup
tutorials so I'll have some link down
below and on the screen right here if
you're interested but they're usually
all just kind of variations of each
other but even in the summer time since
I am filming I do like to put on some
makeup but some days I don't it just
depends and then all I do for hair is
I'll either maybe curl it or straighten
it or leave it natural and today I just
chose to straighten it because I like my
hair treating the best
that the sunshine so here is what a
typical summer outfit looks like for me
my top is from Urban Outfitters and it's
on sale right now so definitely check it
out guys it's so cute and then my jeans
are from Urban Outfitters as well my
necklaces are all kind of vintage so I
don't have places to get them and then
my purse is from Patricia Nash I love it
and my shoes are from lucky yes so cute
my watch is from the brand Yoda and I
absolutely love this watch it is so
unique and versatile and it goes with so
many different outfits I've never seen
someone have a watch like this and I
think it's perfect for the summer so
this is the chorus series Kea and rose
gold one but I also have the Frankie
series zebrawood and champagne one I
love these both so much
they have custom sizing which is great
if you have smaller wrists like myself
and they're just really unique they use
natural colors of wood so they don't use
stains or dyes and they also make a
really great Father's Day gift so if
you're kind of late to the game
definitely try looking at these because
they're super unique and I think all
dads would really appreciate them so
I'll have the link down below and make
sure to stay tuned for the giveaway so
now I'm going to get away with the
brandy Yoda I'm so excited I also wanted
to really quickly kind of tell you guys
about the watches that I got I have this
one which is the chorus series of rose
gold one and I absolutely love this
watch it's so pretty so for someone like
smaller watches this is beautiful let's
have this one which is the Frankie
series of zebrawood and champagne one
this one is so so cool this one's more
versatile and it's definitely more
masculine
I'd love to side with more feminine
pieces so I love both of these watches
and I'll have the link down below so for
the giveaway all you have to do is click
the link down below it should be one of
the first links and basically you just
go through the process and you can get
store credit to get your very own watch
and these are so so cool they're so
unique like I can't emphasize that
enough
it also ends on the 27th so you should
definitely go answer that right now I
also wanted to let you guys know that I
have a coupon code to get $25 off so
I'll have that code right here if you
want to just purchase your own I also
wanted to note that Father's Day is
coming up it's actually really soon by
the time this video goes up
but I think these watches are so cool
especially for a dad I just think
they're so unique and what's better to
give than a really really unique watch
so I really hope you guys enjoyed
