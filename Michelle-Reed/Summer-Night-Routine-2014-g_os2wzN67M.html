computer screen
NFL sleep watching Netflix again it's
really time to get a life today I'm
gonna be doing my actual hundred percent
real summer night routine so hope you
guys enjoy so first I just put away my
laptop and decide that I should probably
go eat some dinner so usually I will eat
with my family but whenever my mom
doesn't cook I'll make myself my own
dinner usually just consists of some
type of sandwich
I love these Hawaiian rolls they're
awesome they're like the sweetest bread
ever and they taste amazing so I just
decided to make myself a sandwich
so what leader
so I used that Hawaiian bread some ham
some Swiss cheese lettuce and a little
bit of mustard if I'm feeling it and
then I just have to add some chips I
know they're not the healthiest but I
love chips then I added some grapes to
be a little healthy then to drink I have
my chick-fil-a lemonade then I enjoyed
this yummy meal while I checked my
Twitter my Instagram and replied to my
texts and snuck a little bit of cake
which ended up being a bad idea after
dinner I go into the bathroom to take my
shower and do my face routine
so first I put my hair up into a very
cute bun knot and then I use my
Neutrogena makeup remover wipes to
remove makeup I set a Phil face wash and
then some Crest toothpaste because you
gotta brush those teeth then I use my
acne lotion which is acts own when I
actually take my shower I use the
retconned color extend shampoo and
conditioner a my Neutrogena body clear
body wash
then I trade in my towel for some
pajamas and tonight I was wearing my
brandy melville hoodie with some really
cute polar bear Airy shorts from
Christmas then I take my hair out of
this turban and apply my it's a 10
miracle leave-in to get out any tangles
and we're gonna pretend I brush it out
with a wide tooth comb because I fail at
life then I just blow-dry my hair which
seems to take forever if only it really
went this fast and then I apply my
Hendra Socony gloss to give my hair is
silky glow can hair even glue I don't
know then I get into bed and let's be
for real no one ever gets in bed that
happy usually I like to read a passage
of my Bible every night typically
something from Psalm it's just because
it calms me down before I go to sleep
because I've been having a lot of
trouble sleeping lately
and then I will also call my boyfriend
some nights and he just kind of makes me
laugh puts me in a good mood so I don't
have incredibly scary dreams
he says howdy peeps and then I pretend
that my lights go off when I clap but
they never do and that's the end on my
nightly routine
xoxo Michelle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
