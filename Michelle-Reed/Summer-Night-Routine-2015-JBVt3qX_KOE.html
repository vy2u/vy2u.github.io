summer night routine for you guys
because you really seem to like my
summer running your teen so I thought
I'd just throw a little night routine
Earthship also very excited for this
video because it is a cloud with
Danielle Maria who is the most positive
and uplifting and just one of the
greatest youtubers her videos are such
good like feel-good videos I think this
make you feel really happy so definitely
you should go watch her video it is a
pool essentials video and I also have it
linked down below if you want to watch
it after this one you should also go
subscribe to her because I believe she's
almost to a hundred thousand subscribers
if not already by the time this video is
up because just abruptly neither because
she's awesome should also subscribe to
me if you're not already because you
know you might as well give this video a
thumbs up if you love routine videos and
with all that stuff being said we're
gonna go ahead and get into the video so
usually at night I will go out and run
some errands go shopping all that good
stuff not all the time but some nights
like in this case I was
then I will head on home to get some
dinner so when I get home the first
thing I do is greet Roxy my German
Shepherd because she's adorable and I
have such an unhealthy obsession with
her so now we eat some dinner my mom
actually made this chicken pasta that
has like peppers and cucumbers in it and
it's honestly it's so good and I love it
and gunner ate with me doesn't always
eat with me this was just tonight so
then my mom also made us some cinnamon
rolls which are homemade and so good
I've literally already had five they are
awesome then I will go put on some comfy
clothes this is my youtube is my cardio
shirt I thought it was appropriate for
the video then I also threw on some
purple shorts from airy and then through
my hair up in a ponytail I also have to
have a little Netflix sesh so lately
I've been watching The Office even
though I've already watched it
completely through then I will go on to
my laptop and maybe edit some videos I
was actually editing the intro for this
one right here and then I'll go on
Twitter and Instagram and also reply to
some YouTube comments after my TV time I
will go into the bathroom and get ready
for bed
I always like to watch some YouTube
videos while I wash my face and usually
it's Alex and Mia's vlogs I've been
obsessed lately I use my Neutrogena
makeup wipes to take off my makeup
they're the only wipes that don't
irritate my eyes I always try to throw
my wife away in the trash and I miss
every time no joke next I just wash my
face with my clinic liquid facial soap
and then I apply my algin is moisturizer
this really does a great job of
moisturizing your skin a lot for the
night time and then I've also used their
eye cream to get rid of puffs and that's
pretty much it for my skincare routine
it's really been clearing up my skin
lately and I'm feeling a lot better not
wearing makeup then I almost forget to
brush my teeth and so I do that right
now then after that I would usually hop
right into the shower but I had actually
already taken one this morning so I
didn't have to two nights and then I'll
head back into my room and light a
candle this is one from Anthropologie
just because it really relaxes me before
I go to bed also I've been having a hard
time sleeping lately for some reason and
I've noticed that watching kind of
positive uplifting videos really helps
me so I've been obsessed with TED talks
because for one you learned so much and
they're so positive and I love learning
new things so I usually watch a couple
of these before I go to bed then I blow
out my candle and fall asleep
so that is it for my nighttime routine
like always I really hoped you guys
enjoyed this video because I love making
videos that you guys like to see it and
definitely request sub or if you have
any other videos you'd like to see down
below if you want to watch another one
of my videos I actually just uploaded a
summer haul video so you should
definitely watch that one because who
doesn't love a classic haul video they
are the best I'll see you guys I next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
