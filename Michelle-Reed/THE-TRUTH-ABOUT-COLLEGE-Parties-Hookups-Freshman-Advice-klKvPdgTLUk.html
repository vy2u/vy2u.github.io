today's video I'm gonna be doing a
freshman year of college advice video
because I just finished my freshman year
of college I had back home in Texas I
thought this was perfect timing to put
up one of these introduce my channel I
won't see the Kings College in New York
City answer questions on my Instagram
which is at-michelle read she's
definitely follow me on there because
I'm always asking for questions for
videos like then you should also go
follow my other social medias while
you're at it they will all be lead right
here Aloha Saul in my blog channel
because I am starting up blogs again
it's Michelle out of her shell deadly
subscribe right there tribes also asked
a ton a ton of questions and so I'm just
going to go ahead and get right into
this video I hope you guys enjoy what if
I things that you should definitely
bring to your dorm room slippers a foam
mattress cover because a college dorm
actresses are so uncomfortable I would
suggest that above anything else a cure
a because coffee is essential a really
really cozy blanket that also really
create artwork or print because whenever
I was doing homework having like pretty
stuff on the wall just made everything
so much nicer if you'll peer pressured
into going to parties now I'm just going
straight up with you guys is not
something that I talked about on my
channel I feel like but I don't party I
don't drink at all do drugs I'm just not
really the party girl kind of person
even in high school I was just never
really the party girl kind of person I
like people knew that that wasn't really
like what I was about I don't go to a
state school so I feel like it's very
much different my school's a little
private schools I feel like it's a
little bit different although I do think
partying happens everywhere it happens
at my school which is not a Christian
school I never really did feel peer
pressure and I think that just because I
obviously was too busy to I never really
had the time to if you're like me I
don't really think that's an issue if
you do fill your schedule with things
for you don't have time to party what
did you think would be difficult about
college that ended up being not so
difficult now this one is not really
relatable but moving to New York I was
so nervous about the subway and actually
another things so easy I have to subway
down so much better that I did whatever
I moved and I was
that was like my biggest concern when
moving was the subway but now it's like
not even a concern at all I would not
say part and hookup culture and five
people that don't participate in it and
as a hook-up culture is really big in
college I talk about this in one of my
other videos on like sex and stuff if
you're in that situation where you feel
like someone is just like being friendly
to you or the guy and you just want to
hook up with you you have every right to
say that you don't want to participate
in that and you have every right to flee
the situation I really believe that if
you want to not feel fear pressure to do
something you should never put yourself
in the situation to where you have to
say no you should be able to separate
yourself from that before you even get
there so for me that would be not going
to parties is that for you feeling love
toka happening I'll continue a
relationship with someone even if it is
just friendly if you know what their
intentions are then say no is really
difficult and I think it's more
important to stop that before you even
get to the point where you have to say
no and that may be cutting off a
friendship or a relationship or like a
friends-with-benefits thing before it
even starts any finding people in
student organizations or in a church is
really important if you want to find
people who don't print in the bank look
up culture be a challenge from
transitioning from high school to
college I think it's saying with both
having a greater workload and we're
studying but also having adult
responsibilities on top of that it's
like not only a school harder but you
also have to do your own laundry you
have to cook your own food at my school
con meal plan you have to clean your own
apartment you have to get your own
groceries you have to do all this stuff
that I feel like you just didn't have at
high school on top of having more work
and so having to balance those what's
really really difficult I think it's
really good to learn how to be an adult
in college because then after college
you're more like steady and ready for
any wish you would have done anything
differently and I definitely wish I
would have done stuff differently
any college is a learning process so
there's always stuff that you kind of
think like you should have done for me I
worked really really hard on schoolwork
and kind of neglected like all their
other areas of my life I'm really happy
with my GPA are really really grateful
for the grapes oh my god if you like I
kind of neglected youtube and I also
neglected in social life it's a next
semester I definitely
to try more at participating more in
friendship and putting in my efforts
there and also working more on YouTube
because I have a lot of cool ideas that
I want to take down the road at the end
of the day those wire in college so I
don't regret it I'm just saying I do
kind of wish I put my efforts in
elsewhere how do you want breakups in
college I don't know if you mean like
from high school to college um but just
keep yourself busy
I think being busy is one of the easiest
ways to solve any problem any of your
host Nick getting out there helps I
think if you are going through a breakup
meeting other friends meeting other
people in general it's really really
helpful give it the are being busy you
don't have time to sit in your apartment
and like dwell on the things that are
making you sad oh you are also asking me
if I was in a sorority because I posted
this picture which is like a little big
picture
I'm not going to sorority my school
houses and so we're putting these houses
they're kind of like sororities but
really not at all they don't feel like
rushing or anything you're automatically
put in one so that's what the big little
thing is a lot of people ask me if I
recommended it I can't say if I
recommend it because I'm not in a
sorority but I know a lot of my friends
are and they really really enjoy them I
think if friendships are really
important to you and having long-term
friends I think authority could be fit
as long as it matches up with your
morals and benefitting you and it's a
positive manner I think it's good how
did you like living with someone that
you didn't know well living with someone
that you don't know before college is
definitely tough but it can also be very
very beautiful I know a lot of friends
who rooms with people were they were
best friends with in college so their
relationship kind of got worse because
when you live with someone their true
colors come out I can say that for
myself I learned like so much about
myself personally by living with so um I
don't like food this is a really
annoying thing I do I should fix that I
don't think it's good I think living
with someone random can be really great
if you make sure that they're not doing
things are like destructive to you I
think it's okay I think communication is
definitely really important if you're
living with someone that you don't know
well something that you're doing could
be really really into why you did this
person it always creates tension and
resentment but if you express the things
that your roommate is doing that kind of
if you unhappy whether that be they
never clean up after themselves so
coming home really late they're bringing
home people that you don't really agree
with I don't know I feel like that's the
only way you could fix things with you
actually communicate that there aren't
things to fix someone said that they
were nursing school and they needed help
staying motivated and this is something
that I can definitely help with in
college this thing is it is not free I
know nothing in life is actually free
but in public school you need to be like
oh my gosh I'm forced to be here by the
government or something but in college
you or your parents are paying a
significant amount of money for you to
be there I would suggest looking at how
much each class is worth when it would
be like $400 $500 $800 $200 you will
never want to skip class when you
realize how much money you're putting
into school I hardly ever skip class my
school also was more like picky about
attendance so it's not that so assuming
that you can just like miss Atomik la I
was always motivated to go to class
because I was like oh my gosh this is
how much money that my parents are
paying for me to be in this class and so
I'm going to be there I'm going to do my
best and I'm going to work hard because
my parents are paying for it have you
ever wanted to change your major if you
guys don't know I have a business major
just like a general a business
management major and I definitely have
thought about changing my major just
because for me I am very detail-oriented
and I like numbers a lot and I like
things that are very black and white but
I feel like in business a lot of things
are very black and white it always comes
down to like your office a part of me
has always kind of considered switching
to finance my boyfriend Eden it was
actually a finance major at first as
well you gotta know me into stuff
related Elias and always try to convince
me to switch because he thought I would
be better in it it's always something
I've kind of constipated but nothing
that I've actually taken seriously
because I do think that business is like
better for me to be in with being on
YouTube and stuff so those are all the
questions I'm going to answer in this
video if you have any other ones that
didn't get answered
leaving them below because I will be
answering the questions in this video
for sure because I know what
probably freaking out about going to
college next year I would be here to
calm your nerve you show up in the watch
my last video which will be linked right
here I love you guys so much
make sure to subscribe I'll see you guys
in my next one bye friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
