favorites to do because it is going to
be a video all about productivity and
how to make the most out of your summer
I love summer but it's so easy to just
sit around and not do anything in the
summer and this is probably one of my
last summers home and so I really just
want to take advantage of my summer and
I'm gonna be telling you guys my
favorite tips making sure you seize each
day and you're going towards a greater
goal is so important and so I'm so
excited in this video to share with you
guys five of my top tips on how to make
the most of your summer if you want to
keep up with me along this summer and
unless my blogs are put on this channel
during the school year but I'm actually
blowing in my second channel during the
summer it's Michelle out of her shell
and host blogs two to three times a week
and so I'm always posting on there also
down below let me know your number one
summer goal I want to save X amount of
money or I want to get this job or I
want to land this internship eat healthy
or I'm going to work out a lot whatever
it may be leave it down below and if you
have the same goal of someone else be
like yeah I'm trying to do that too just
so we can all connect cuz I want this
YouTube channel to be more like a family
my first tip would be to update your
summer wardrobe there's something so fun
about starting a season with some fresh
new clothes it's even better if buying
those fresh new clothes doesn't break
the bank
today's video is sponsored by Arizona
Jean Co you were running where these
overalls are from that's where they're
from
I love updating my wardrobe and just
having some fresh new things to wear for
the summertime it always makes me feel
motivated this may seem shallow
obviously you don't have to go out and
buy a ton of stuff but it's really fun
for me already with a couple of new
pieces so these are four of my favorite
Arizona junko outfits Arizona Jean coat
is available at JCPenney if you want to
check them out so you can check out
online I'll have a link down below their
clothes are affordable but they're so so
cute particularly excited about the
sponsorship because they have this
really awesome hashtag and it's called
as you are it's all about embracing your
individual style and they see
and so my first outfit is of course the
overalls I am wearing in this video I
love them because they're shorts which
is great for the Texas heat my shirt
underneath is just like a cropped little
ruffled top I think it's so girly this
is also from Arizona Jean CO and then I
just throw on some high tops with all of
these outfits because I love high tops
and they always go well with my summer
outfits this one I also think is cute
this dress has a little bit of a cutout
but it's not too much because sometimes
cutouts are a little bit excessive but
this dress is so comfy it's also from
Arizona and Jean Co as well as my jacket
that I threw over top of it I love just
kind of throwing jean jackets over
dresses in case it gets a little chilly
at night and then my next outfit I'm
just wearing this top which is also from
Arizona Jean Co as well as my jeans I
love it because it's kind of off the
shoulder but not too much it really
accentuates your collarbones which I
think looks really nice and then these
jeans are just distressed I think the
bottom is so cute they almost kind of
flare out a little bit and they're super
distressed and light wash which is
perfect for the summertime and then my
last outfit I love this denim skirt it's
also from Arizona Jean Co and I'm just
wearing the same top that I was wearing
in the first outfit I love the center
skirt because it's not too too short
it's like the perfect length but it's
still flattering and perfect for the
summer time if you want to check out my
Instagram all you have to do on that
Instagram picture is comment what your
number one summer goal is so the exact
same thing you're commenting on this
video you also must follow Arizona Jean
Co on Instagram as well and you'll be
entered to win a $25 gift card my second
tip would be to switch up music for
podcast
there's something about listening the
podcast in the morning that is just so
relaxing and it really just pumps me up
it makes me feel motivated if you have
my favorite podcast lately I really love
how I built this out entrepreneurship
and people who started companies like
Eileen Fisher Sara Blakely you started
space I needed to find the courage to
take a leap of faith and somehow someway
I figured that out so motivating
listening to their stories I absolutely
love that vodka
I also I'm really in Econ and so I
started listening to econ talk which is
also really good I other ones that are
currently enjoying down below but yeah
I'd like to listen to them whenever I'm
in the shower whenever I'm driving
somewhere whenever I'm getting ready in
the morning because it really makes me
feel motivated as opposed to just
listening to music number three is to
embrace healthy eating there is no
better time to start healthy eating than
summer because the produce is so fresh
have time to try out new recipe probably
don't have to meal prep as much because
you're probably at home or and so I
would highly recommend trying out
healthy eating this summer is one of my
favorite recipes for the morning I
currently really love eating chia seed
pudding and it's basically just chia
seeds with some Greek yogurt and some
almond milk with banana and you mix it
up leave it overnight and it is so tasty
number four is to try a new workout
this is something I've recently done if
you watch my blog channel I am always
working out I love working out I kind of
can get in a rut with my workouts and so
I wanted to try something new so hi I've
recently been doing kala it scenes
workouts I think that they're really
great they're challenging they're hard
for me and they're definitely something
new kind of free workouts on YouTube and
let me know if I should do a workout
video guys I've been thinking lately
that I kind of want to start like a
college fitness and health plan
something like that I don't know exactly
maybe this is my number one goal for the
suburb let me know if you'd be into that
and let me know if you would like to see
that start a new workout it makes you
feel good do it in the morning and it
really makes you feel productive before
starting your day and lastly this one is
kind of read them and not necessarily as
pumped up as other ones but try deleting
a social media app I have found myself
mindlessly scrolling on different social
media apps for so long and particularly
one that brings me absolutely no joy
that's when my viewers like respond to
me and stuff I think that's really cool
I hate Twitter I really don't like
Twitter it leaves me in such a bad
headspace after I get off of it there
are always people bickering there are
always people just going at it and I
find every time I go on it I feel better
and so I finally just deleted the app
and obviously I still have my Twitter to
tweet out video links for you guys but
if there's a social media app that's
bringing you down media Instagram and
maybe you should just take a little
hiatus for a week and it could be really
really good for your soul and it can
also help you be productive
this summer so you're not spending all
your time on there especially if it's
making you feel worse about yourself so
those are all the tips that I have this
is what I'm going to be doing for summer
these are all things that I'm
implementing again if you want to check
