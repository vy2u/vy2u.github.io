zodiac sign is and I really know that is
either quality you look for in a partner

who's sweet and kind and just like I
said I actually cares for you does it

been in like wrestling fights with my
siblings but I've never been like a
legit fistfight with someone turn on

gosh everybody asked me why my username
is what it means okay I had an old
channel and it was called smiling
Shelley and I made my solo videos on
their with my sister that channel got
deleted somehow and so I wanted to make
a new one and I wanted people to know

forgot the why so that is literally what
my name means and it's so stupid and I
hate it
