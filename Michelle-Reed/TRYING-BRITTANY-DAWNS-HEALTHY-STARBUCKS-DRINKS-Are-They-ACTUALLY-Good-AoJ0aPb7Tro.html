you're new to my channel what's up you
should subscribe this is a different
kind of video I usually don't do these
kinds of videos we wanted to do a video
of a week of trying out Britney Don
fitnesses healthy Starbucks dream
options as you guys know I love
Starbucks I love coffee and I'm always
so intrigued by her videos that are
talking all about like the healthy
Starbucks drinks I know people have
probably done this I'm not saying this
is my idea I'm just doing it because I
want to try out these drinks and so
today's Monday as you can see I'm
probably gonna be in workout clothes
whatever I do this because I usually go
to Starbucks after I workout so I'm
gonna be looking super sweaty I'm about
to head to the gym five different drinks
that I'm gonna be trying out and I'm
gonna be writing them from one to ten
Drive if you're new and let's just go
ahead and get right into this we just
got out of my workout and I'm actually
going to order these drinks online and
then pick them up because they're really
complex and I don't want them to hate me
no what I'm trying today is the grande
iced americano unsweetened with two
pumps of sugar-free vanilla and two
pumps of mocha so I just picked it up
and here is the taste test oh my
goodness so good it literally tastes
like chocolate guys I recommend if
you're someone who likes sweet iced
coffee this is so good probably rate
this eight nine I love it so today is
day two and I'm obviously not in workout
clothes and that is just because I
worked out earlier but I wanted to wait
to get my drink and so I'm actually
doing it well enough to go around air
and I'm doing a healthier pink drink and
so basically it is an unsweetened
passion tea with coconut milk and no
sweetener easy eyes and one pump of
sugar-free vanilla pretty sure the
coconut milk at Starbucks still has a
bit of sugar in it and so I don't think
this is entirely healthy but I just got
out of Starbucks and I picked it up and
it looks kind of interesting and has a
lot of stuff like on the bottom
that's pretty good I'm not a huge tea
person and so I don't think that it is
like my favorite thing this is so
awkward as a man walking out and
definitely more of an iced coffee girl
I'm not necessarily a huge tea person so
I think I want to read this a 7 out of
10 but it's good if you like tea and
it's definitely healthier than the
normal Petrie hey guys I'm about to pick
up today's Starbucks drink I'm also have
it on my Harry X I'm getting joy shampoo
my hair is a mess so for today's drink
I'm doing a grande iced skinny vanilla
latte with one cup of sugar free vanilla
the thing is I like to keep things
pretty dairy free because dairy just
kind of upsets my stomach and so I kind
of modified this a little bit I got a
grande iced cafe latte that way long
distress so on the milk and 2 pounds of
sugar-free vanilla so it's kind of like
a skinny iced vanilla latte so it's not
the exact same I just don't really like
drinking regular milk so this is a drink
and I'm pretty sure this has regular
milk in it because I don't think all I
notice this life it was very good I
really like this I still think I like
the first one the best but I would
probably rate this and eight it is good
I'm just writing in it because I think
they still put regular milk in it but I
support it so it is Saturday I ordered
two drinks today and that is because I'm
just gonna try both and then give one to
someone at my house because I want to
upload this video but I have two more
that I want to try so I got two drinks
the first one is an iced cinnamon almond
milk macchiato and it has no cinnamon
Dolce syrup but two pumps of sugar-free
cinnamon Dolce syrup blonde espresso and
light caramel drizzle and then light
cinnamon Dolce sprinkles still by no
means I got healthy drink but healthier
I also did an espresso Frappuccino with
one pub as a Frappuccino roast because
usually has three mundane Ana double
blended with blonde espresso and almond
milk sounds more like a coffee a Pacino
so we're gonna see if that is any good
second drink isn't exactly what she
normally orders but she always does
blended drinks and so I wanted to try
one that was blended and not necessarily
Frappuccino so we're gonna see if these
are
any good so first up I'm trying the one
with the banana this is the grande
espresso crappuccino oh my goodness that
is so good oh my gosh guys if you are
someone who is in there like kind of
sweeter drinks it almost tastes like a
banana coffee smoothie this is so good
definitely recommend this be like this
would be good after a workout too this
is the healthier caramel macchiato very
good it's definitely not as sweet so
really good and I think it tastes pretty
good this one I would probably rate a 10
it definitely is not like the healthiest
thing ever but it's really sweet I think
it's good and then this one I would
probably rate a nine is it for my
Starbucks video if you guys happen to
try out any of these recipes of course
most of them are from Brittany dawn
Fitness I modified them a little bit
though make sure to tag me in them on
instagram my instagram is at Michelle
Rhee I would love to see your creation
and let me know if you enjoyed like this
trying out video I would definitely love
to do more like trying this this I kind
of want to do trying vegan for a week my
paleo for a week think that's these
kinds of videos would be super fun I
love you guys and I'll see you guys my
