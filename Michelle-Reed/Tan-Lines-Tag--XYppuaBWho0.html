I'm going to be doing the tan lights tag
which was created by that stuffy here on
YouTube and she also tagged me to do
this but I decided to do this since I
was tagged and I'm also be tacking some
people down below and I tagged everybody
to do this so yeah let's go ahead and
get started I can speech also be a cool
thing to have you know there aren't
really any beaches around my live my
favorite summer here so it would
probably be like when you get done out
of the pool or beach if you live near
beach and you just kind of braid your
hair I like the way that looks I guess I
burned and then I tan I guess that's not
really how it happened I mean I do tan
but I burn at the same time so I guess
vote no I have not but I have gotten a
like airbrush tattoo but I've never
gotten a henna probably seen night
swimming because bonfires are honestly
just really hide and its really hot
where I live in bonfires on top of that
was just kind of really hot also a big
swimmer i like to swim a lot in the
summer so definitely nice with me
probably the venice italy sister
somewhere i've always wanted to travel
it's not really specific to summer but I
just always wanted to go to Venice Italy
and I would definitely want to go there
over the summer or just any beach
somewhere I'd go anywhere
and probably bikini just because tankies
look really awkward on me and I can
never find really any cute one-piece
swimsuit besides like no really nobody
really sells one piece sources that are
to you so probably bikinis because are
the cues ones like fine so I have to to
show we all and the first one is the
dream fresh BB cream for me because it
has SPF 30 which is great for it the
summertime it's just lighten II don't
need a lot in the summer so I like this
and also an EOS lip balm ideally I would
have the one that had SPF but I actually
ran out of that so I'm going to get
another one for summer but I really do
like us but keep your lips moisturize
yeah I definitely must have these for
summer probably around like 110 degrees
i don't think it's gone above that other
words pretty hot so it might have gotten
about that i'm not really sure but i
think around 110 would be the hottest
besides dancing on my drill team I don't
do anything else over the summer that
would also be negative don't really have
a summer bucket list from I gotta do
this gotta do that I mean just have fun
and I don't really have that exciting
summer but yeah I don't have anything
probably longer because my hair is
pretty long if you can't tell and I'm
not gonna cut it so I'm thinking about
offering it i'm pretty sure not but i
mean i might who knows because my hair
is always doing this color in this
length i don't know i might win do
something different
honestly I don't have one I was sitting
here for a long time trying to think and
don't really have any bad summer
memories think I broke my leg over the
summer I'm not really sure but that
would be pretty bad if it was over the
summer so that is the end of this video
and make sure to check the down bar if I
tagged you and if I didn't feel free to
this tag and yeah i'll see you guys my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
