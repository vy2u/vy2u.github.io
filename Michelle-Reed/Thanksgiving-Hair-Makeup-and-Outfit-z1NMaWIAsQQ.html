Thanksgiving a hair makeup and outfit so
this is what I would wear to
Thanksgiving or a meal or whatever it's
kind of dressy for me but I think it's
very appropriate for the occasion so
yeah I hope you guys enjoy so first I'm
just starting off with makeup and I
already did my foundation it was just my
normal foundation routine and then I'm
taking my Too Faced blush and I'm
applying this to my cheeks it's a cream
blush and it's a nice berry color and
I'm just blending it in and then I'm
just taking an elf coral blush and I'm
setting the cream on with that so it
lasts throughout the night and then I'm
taking my kitten a smudge pot and I'm
applying this to my eyes as primer and
then taking my original Naked palette
I'm using the gold color I think it's
called half-baked and I'm applying this
to my lid
and then I'm taking naked and I'm
applying this increase
- a mess and then taking smog and
darkhorse I'm mixing these together and
applying it in my outer corner for some
definition and I'll tell you my
handy-dandy a blending brush I'm
blending everything together
and then I just used a cream eyeshadow
from the sila palette and I applied this
under my brow into my inner corner to
brighten up my eyes now I'm just lining
my eyes with my Stila brown eyeliner
and applying my Maybelline one by one
mascara which I love and I've used it in
like every video but it's honestly just
my favorite so
Sofer lips I'm just applying a chapstick
this is the eos one and I think
Thanksgiving it's nice to wear red
lipstick is just something I like to do
so I'm taking this clinic one that's
kind of a berry color and I'm applying
this to my lips so yeah that's
everything for makeup and I hope you
guys like this look like I do silver
hair I am using my Conor infinity wand I
love this curling iron and I'm putting
it on the second highest heat setting
and then I'm sectioning off my hair cuz
I will be doing this in sections so I'm
doing the bottom layers first and
basically I just wrap it around the
barrel for about five seconds I'd say
and then I let it go and pull on the
hair and this gives kind of a softer
looking at something I found to like so
I just wrap it around hold it for five
seconds and then pull it down and then I
just hair sprayed each layer after I was
done and then I did two more layers yep
it's very very easy and this curling
iron really curls your hair as you can
see I wanted some very precise curls and
then once I'm done I am just hair
spraying everything so it stays all
throughout the night
so for my outfit um this is a look that
I went for I'm wearing a lace shirt that
is from H&amp;amp;M and I love it because the
sleeves kind of fly away and I think
it's so pretty
and then my skirt is from a thrift shop
but it was originally from Zara I love
it as well and then my tights are from
each of them as well they're just brown
and then I'm wearing these really cute
booty type shoes and they're from Target
and they're so cute and I know they're
dirty but they're still cute
and then my pearl earrings are from my
sister-in-law she gave them to me
they're absolutely beautiful so yep
that's everything and I hope you guys
enjoyed this and got some inspiration
for your Thanksgiving meal and I'll see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
