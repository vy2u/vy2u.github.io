can't do in college or else you will
literally destroy yourself hi everyone
today I'm so excited for today's video
because I am just sitting and I'm
talking and I don't care how long this
video is I wanted to do a Q&amp;amp;A with
answering your very specific college
questions I asked her questions on my
Instagram just for you guys to DM me and
you guys actually sent quite a few
questions and so I'm gonna go through
them and answer them in today's video
you just clipped on this video let me
know down below where you are applying
to school where you go to school what
schools your dream school I definitely
love to hear if you just clicked on this
video my name is Michelle Reid and I go
to the king's college in year city
someone else how do you Congress dress
with exams all piling up curly in that
situation right now and sick I'm so
sorry being sick in college is the worst
like I totally get it for me my biggest
tip and this is something that you're
probably not gonna want to hear but you
need to hear is stop procrastinating I'm
just gonna be honest like I am NOT a
procrastinator procrastination scares me
and I don't know how people do it
because if I procrastinated I would be
such a stressed person all just taught
me how type-a I am we're like I start
stuff like four days in advance and I
review it I have a test in like a week I
will start studying like at least bare
minimum four days before procrastination
turns you into a worse version of
yourself no matter who you are no matter
if you say I'm just one of those persons
who could do things under pressure and I
can do things the day before the thing
is if you start things early you don't
have that added stress on top of you and
so you naturally can like relax and
think through what you're doing whereas
if you start things the night before I
guess people do this and I'm probably
eight comments people may like no this
is like today you're so stressed so for
me what motivates me to study in advance
is just that knowledge of what that
stress feels like when you start things
the night before and that scares me out
of like it hurts other people with that
you like do life with because it affects
them as well
you didn't go to school in New York City
where would you go so I get this
question a lot and I applied to three
schools so I apply
Kings in New York City I applied to UT
Austin Liberty University of Virginia I
didn't go to King's I would definitely
be at UT Austin I was actually very
split between the two just because UT
Austin has a really good business school
there Macomb School of Business if you
know I got on there marketing school
which was like a huge goal of mine and
so if I didn't end up at Kings I'd
definitely be there do you have any tips
on how to not be intimidated by your
peers in college and I like this
question because I feel like no one
really answers this if you go to a
school that's really competitive and
we're grades matter a lot and especially
if it's a really small community
intimidation is something that just like
naturally comes and people just always
feel like everyone's their competition
it's like these are my job competitors
these aren't my peers and it's just
awful that mentality is so sad and it
tears people apart makes people not be
able to be vulnerable know that deep
down no matter what image someone is
displaying no matter what facade they
are putting on there is something within
a lot of struggling with something no
one is perfect
no one has everything together some
people are better at time management
some people have better habits but no
one is completely perfect and no one is
completely great at everything and it's
so important to remember that everyone
falls in just because you feel like
you're the only one falling at this
moment you're not the law of attraction
really plays into this you attract what
you put out if you put out this very
welcoming vulnerable open that is what
you're gonna attract you're gonna
attract friends like that you're going
to attract other people in your life
better like that be the kind of person
that you would want to be friends with
sound so simple I know you're told that
like second grade but it's honestly so
true like I would never want to be
friends with someone who is constantly
asserting themselves over me who is
constantly feeling like they had to
dominate me you always felt like I was
their competition that is not the kind
of person you want to be friends with so
don't be that with other people be happy
when other people succeed be happy
whenever they do something that you like
that's really great and root for them
and pray for them I think that's the
best way that you can attract people you
gonna be friends with as college maid
you like my CLS or like it even more New
York City I just can't really explain it
there's not
just like a casual day you have a really
good day or you have a really bad day it
can be influenced by commuting by the
MTA Bonnie your grocery bag falling
while you're taking your 20-minute walk
home like it's just stuff like that I
can like really ruin your day for the
most part it has made me like mi see a
lot more I think last year I was a
little bit overwhelmed with the city and
I didn't have such a great relationship
with it but I think that this year I
just like made the most of living here
and really appreciating it and being in
the same neighborhood for two years you
really like get to know people like the
other day it's just so weird in New York
City like the other day I was with my
boyfriend and we saw this guy who walks
like the same dog every night or night
before we had pet his dog and he like
remembered us and was like oh what do
you guys names a few of them the
neighborhood it's just stuff like that
that makes you really appreciate the
city's like the small moments has been
the most stressful class this semester
and are you doing any internships this
summer my supposed stressful class this
semester has definitely been my American
political thought and practice class is
basically analyzing primary documents
and you have like three essays and
that's basically your grade and I tried
so much in that class guys but sometimes
you can only try so much and sometimes
like you just are not gonna get the
grade you want and I was telling my
lowest grade I just like could not get
A's on any of my papers and it was
killing me I was so mad so spending so
much time on these but it's just a hard
class as far as internships goes I'm not
doing any internships this summer I just
have too many trips planned this summer
sister's having a baby and I just want
to be home I like really miss home
YouTube gives me the opportunity to work
on something to make like the same
amount of money I would be making
outside of college and so it just like
makes sense to keep doing this right now
and if I want to do an internship I will
do one next year
yeah I just want to be home I like want
to be with my new little baby nephew
Ezra and I just I don't know what are
your plans for when you graduate will
you stay in New York or move back home
or move somewhere else
I plan after school to stay in New York
for sure long term I think I would want
to stay here for about ten years and
then move back to Texas but that's just
like my idea right now
it could go completely south obviously
it depends on a lot of factors so what
was it a business major what do you
think my major would be
my major I'm pretty shared me something
with economics I actually really enjoy
economics and the school that I at has
like a great economic program just like
the professors are so so good I have no
idea what I would do with that but I
just think it's interesting it's a
really good question and someone asks
how will you know if you and someone
will work well as roommates because I
know that a lot of you guys are probably
going to school soon you're probably
picking your roommates I think it's hard
if you're meeting people online you
really can't know until you live with
them people are gonna lie about their
habits people are gonna say yeah I'm so
morning person and then they sleep until
12:00 or oh yeah I'm such a night person
and then they go to bed at like 10:30
it's just really hard I think you really
have to vibe it out and like know if
someone's telling the truth or not and
just be very upfront about things that
you want in your room don't feel like
you're asking for too much don't feel
like you're being annoying like if
you're someone who's super clean and
it's gonna stress you out if there's
stuff everywhere all the time tell them
communicate that it's so important if
you're someone who doesn't want to be
buddy-buddy with your roommate who wants
to be able to do other things not with
your roommate communicate that to them
obviously they're gonna be a few things
that you're gonna have to compromise on
but know what like your main things are
and know them right I never thought I
was a super clean person back home just
cuz my mom is like extremely clean but
guy is like ever since coming to college
I realize I'm a clean freak and I like
things to be picked up I like dishes to
be washed every night and so that's
important to me and so you definitely
learned stuff about yourself in college
but just know that the person that
you're living with is trustworthy
any advice for coming anxiety when about
to start college take time for yourself
and do things that calm you for me
that is praying every single night
reading my Bible every single night even
if it's just a verse and praying and
meditating that keeps me calm because it
makes me feel less anxious and in the
end that's what you really have to do in
college to stay sane things that you
need and don't need for college so I get
this question a lot and I've actually
done like two different videos on this
if you want to watch them Dornan stuff I
would say things that you need I
prioritize lighting so that would be
lamps wall lights fairy lights cuz
lights really do change like your
overall attitude and I think they're
really important for me so that you
don't need I don't think
you need a ton of fancy desk stuff like
little stationary things and pencil
holders and stuff like that like it's
cute and all but honestly having a
cluttered desk like look how cluttered
my desk is right now that makes me so
anxious I don't bring all that crap to
school like just dump her clothes a rain
jacket and a rain umbrella or an
umbrella don't mind if I want school you
go to so I wear a lot of nicer clothes
because my school's business casual so I
kind of have to but if you don't I would
say don't bring a ton of fancy clothes
if you're gonna be wearing t-shirts a
lot and also don't bring a ton of extra
books I know a lot of people like to
have books like on a bookshelf but
you're gonna be reading so much for
college that like just having 1 to 2
free books is ok but don't like bring
all of your memory books from home
because you're not gonna read them and
they're just gonna take up space let me
know again where you're going to school
or where you plan on going to school or
where you're going right now I'm
definitely interested I love you guys
