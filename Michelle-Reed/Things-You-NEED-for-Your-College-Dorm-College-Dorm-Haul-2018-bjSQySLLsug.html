this is going to be my first college
video of the summer I am so excited
because it is going to be a dorm hall or
an apartment hall as you can see I have
quite a few bags beside me because I've
already started doing my shopping next
year I'm moving into my first kind of
like big-girl real apartment off-campus
place and so I'm so excited to decorate
so I've got a few things to show you
guys this video is also going to be kind
of things that you need for your dorm
the essentials these are all things that
I kind of forgot to bring my first year
that I remembered that I actually do
need so I also want this to be kind of
like a checklist style video I also want
to thank my friends over at PV dorm for
sponsoring this video
I love Pottery Barn and their stuff is
so nice and it's like one of my favorite
companies so this is a really cool
sponsorship for me something that I'm so
excited for show you guys a few things
that you need for your dorms let me know
down below where you are going to
college whether you're in school you're
about to go to school whatever it may be
and yeah that's everything that I have
to say so let's just go ahead and get
right into this haul video first I'm
gonna start off with the stuff from
Pottery Barn dorm I first got this
little tapestry I don't have a picture
of this is kind of hard to show but it's
basically like this rope detailing kind
of tapestry love this because most of
the stuff I thought for my apartment is
pretty neutral but as you can tell this
has some pretty bright colors in it
that's one thing that I would recommend
bringing to your dorm is some decorative
pieces that make it feel more homey if
you only put it central so it can become
kind of like sterile in your apartment
but I find that stuff like this really
makes dorms kind of more homey and
personalized even if you strung some
lights in this or something that's
something that I so love to do in my
dorm room and so I totally recommend
picking up one of these things I think
this is gonna go really really pretty in
my bedroom I also got just an essential
duvet cover
I really prefer having a duvet cover and
a duvet as opposed to just a comforter
for me it makes it really easy whenever
I wash my do things and that's Alex if I
have make sure that you bring a tube a
cover in a duvet instead of just like a
normal comforter this one is from PB
dorm it's really really nice it's just
super white comfortable this is a twin
XL so it's made for a dorm room as well
at pro tip if you want to have a really
fluffy duvet actually stuff
to duvets into a duvet cover and that's
what I'm gonna do I also got this little
pink pillow I love pink and basically
for my room I just want everything to be
pretty neutral with just pops of pink
I'm your mate Naja that's most of her
stuff is that color too and so it'll
work out perfectly together but I love
this color it's the design on it it's
really pretty I would definitely
recommend bringing decorative pillows to
your dorm they really make it more homey
and you're probably gonna spend a lot of
time in your bed and college just
hanging out or to Netflix doing that
kind of stuff my actual duvet cover I
got this one which you can't really tell
in the bag but it's just like a white
duvet with little gold tassels on it I
know white Betty might not seem
practical but for me it just makes you
feel like I'm sleeping in a cloud and I
really like white bedding and so I just
picked up this duvet cover I've had my
duvet cover for quite some time now but
I'm kind of ready to have a new little
something along with that duvet cover I
got two of these tassel shams they just
match to the bedding and so I'm gonna
use these to actually put my pillows on
which is nice because I've never
actually had like matching shams I've
never ever wanted to spend the money but
I'm so thankful that I have these I also
got a giant rug which I'm not gonna
obviously hold up because it's a rug
that I will insert a picture it's just
like it's hand knit material rugs are so
essential for a dorm room you guys they
make it so much cozier whenever you're
walking around without shoes on you know
having a rug in your apartment just
makes it so cozy even if you already
have carpet I would still recommend it I
thought this one was really pretty and
it would go with everything whether it
went in the living room or our dorm room
so that's all the stuff I got from PB
dorm I'll have all of it linked down
below if you want to check it out I
definitely recommend shopping there P
need some dorm stop a lot of their stuff
is reasonably priced you're not gonna
break the bank so that's all the stuff
I've picked up so far from my apartment
make sure you stay tuned because I'm
gonna be doing so many moving vlogs and
not planning on moving in until August I
literally don't even have an apartment
yet his New York City apartment hunting
is crazy guys if you want to come along
through my journey make sure you oh also
make sure you're following my blog
channel I will have it linked right here
if you want to check it out again you
should definitely check out Pottery Barn
dorm link down below I love their stuff
and it's definitely the best quality
and the best for your dorm room so I'd
recommend that for sure I love you guys
and I'll see you guys in my next video
