feeling in the summertime it's really
hard to be productive but it's really
easy to get boarded so today we are
going to make a nice little list of
things to do when you're bored in the
summertime and how to be productive my
first tip would be to go and plan out
whether this be you know what you want
to accomplish in the summer what your
goals are what you're thinking of doing
just go to a nice coffee shop and maybe
sit outside and look around and just
think of things to do and things that
you want to be able to say oh hey I did
that during the summer and so I like to
do this and plan out my videos and plan
out you know things that I want to get
done in the summertime and I think it's
really really good to do just to kind of
have a game plan number two would be to
try something new I think it's so
important in the summertime just to find
a hobby or something that you've always
wanted to do but you've never had time
to it's the perfect time to do in the
summertime so whether that be picking up
photography taking pictures with your
friends or even starting a YouTube
channel I think the summer time is the
perfect time to start a YouTube channel
if you've been thinking about it because
you have some free time and you can go
outside and find cool locations and just
really give it a go and I love YouTube
and I'd recommend it to anyone
number three is to clean out your closet
I think it's really important to just
declutter all of your clothes and in the
summertime it's so perfect to do this
because you can start fresh and new and
maybe get a few new pieces to replace
them and you can also give away your
clothes to those who need them more than
you so I definitely recommend doing this
or you can also sell your clothes to
make some extra money
number four is exercise since it's the
summer time and you probably have more
time on your hands you don't have the
excuse of oh hey I'm too busy so I
definitely say to just go outside and
kind of create a workout plan you could
write it down I have so many workout
videos guys on how to get fit what I do
because over the past like eight months
or so I've really adopted a healthier
lifestyle and I work out five days a
week so I definitely recommend it and
it's perfect for the summer time to pass
some time
I just farming just for a minute
number five is to read often guys in the
summertime you have so much time to kill
and so I love starting new books in the
summer there's nothing like finding a
really good book to start I love it I'll
leave a few of my favorites down below
or I can mention them in a video if you
guys would like that but I really enjoy
just starting a new book because it's
such a good feeling and it's so better
for your brain just to get some
knowledge in rather than you know
sitting around or something so
definitely recommend finding a good book
number six would be to take a road trip
if you do have the money to travel
definitely do it go with a few friends
it does not to be anywhere super cool
can be an hour away maybe but just to
get a new perspective on things and to
visit where you live and find some new
locations and maybe take some videos
take some pictures and just have a
really good time road tripping is so
much fun especially in the summer
and lastly would be to explore if you
have free time just go out in your city
and find some cool new places I love
going to flower shops because for one
they're beautiful and you can get some
really good clips but also it's just fun
and if you don't have anything to do you
might as well just go out instead of
sitting at home and so definitely
recommend doing this you don't have to
necessarily have a goal you can just go
somewhere not do anything like there's
nothing wrong with that but I love
exploring and I definitely recommend it
so I really hope you guys enjoyed
watching this video I try to make it a
little bit different just because it's
ever good to keep doing the same thing
on YouTube and I always like to switch
it up so make sure to leave me a comment
down below if you enjoyed it also trying
to be a little bit more social on my
instagram and twitter so if you guys
want to follow me on there i talk more
about my life and you get to just kind
of see more into what i do everyday so
you should definitely follow me on both
Instagram and Twitter and also make sure
