video all about things to do for winter
and fall kind of this awkward transition
into winter so I think to do I have a
couple outfits and also some treats and
some DIY stuff so just literally
everything jam-packed into one video and
I'm super excited because this kind of
kick starts my holiday videos which I
will be starting now and I'm so so
excited absolutely to let you guys know
that I created a blog channel
finally it is Michelle out of her shell
and so I will have it linked down below
I'm going to be doing vlogmas which is
so exciting I cannot wait but I've never
done that before so definitely subscribe
to my vlog channel we'll be right here
it'll be down below so if you want to
get to know me more definitely subscribe
to that channel it is Michelle out of
her show and if pretty sure that's
everything that I have to say so let's
just go ahead and start the video so the
first thing I recommend doing is going
and buying some new winter candles I
love updating my candle collection once
it is the winter season actually that
buy any here though because they weren't
too 420 which is insane and I refuse to
buy one candle for twenty dollars so
just wait for when they have sales and
stock up it's so much fun even if you
just go and smell all the new candles I
also love going on winter walks with my
friends you can take some pictures and
dress up cute and just have some nice
pictures for yourself and talk and enjoy
the crisp weather it's really really fun
this is my first outfit this one is
definitely more of a fall outfit but it
can definitely be useful when you're
transitioning into winter
my huge comfortable sweater is from
Nordstrom Rack I love it it's so warm
and cozy and then my jeans are from Gap
and these are my booties from choies
I've had these forever and then this hat
is from Urban Outfitters I believe and
then my crossbody bag is from Italy
because it was a gift
anyhow this is it for my first outfit
the colors of the second outfit are
definitely more winter I know it's
definitely not warm enough for some
climates but I live in Texas so it's
definitely enough to keep you warm my
dress is from Urban Outfitters it's so
pretty and flowy and then this huge
sweater is also from Urban Outfitters I
love it it's so comfy and then I just
have on my Daniel well exude watch which
I'll have down below and then these
Maroons Heights which I believe are from
Target and again my same black choice
boots I also think it's fun to have a
movie marathon with some friends so just
watch all your favorite Christmas movies
make some hot chocolate make some
popcorn and just enjoy your time
watching a ton of movies and getting
into the spirit with some friends
these are two of my favorite hot
chocolate recipes the first one is
peppermint hot chocolate and the second
one is frozen hot chocolate which is so
cool so for the peppermint hot chocolate
all you're going to need is some whole
milk some half-and-half some milk
chocolate chips some marshmallows some
candy canes and then peppermint extract
so first I am just mixing a cup of milk
and a cup of half-and-half on medium on
the stove and then also half a cup of
the chocolate chips and I'm just mixing
this around until the chocolate chips
are melted and then adding a cap full of
peppermint extract and then I'm just
pouring this into my mug adding some
marshmallows in a candy cane and that
isn't it super simple and so tasty guys
I'm not kidding you it's so good and
rich for the next one you'll need milk
hot chocolate mix whipped cream and so
all I'm doing is pouring about a cup of
milk and then two packets of the hot
chocolate mix and then as much ice as
you need until you get a nice kind of
thick icy texture and I'm adding whipped
cream and that's it for the frozen hot
chocolate is so good another one of my
favorite activities is to go see the
Christmas lights whether it's on houses
or just in a local mall it's definitely
fun to just go look at the lights with a
friend you know grab some hot chocolate
and talk and have a really good time
there weren't really any Christmas
lights on houses out yet so I just went
to a local shopping center and it was a
ton of fun
you can also do some winter shopping
just if you want to pick up you know a
new jacket and new sweaters something
simple it's definitely fun to go look
out at what all the stores have to offer
now in the wintertime I love shopping so
this is definitely one of my favorite
activities and then lastly we have a DIY
advent calendar so it basically just
looks like this and I put it on a
bulletin board and it's super cute to
count down the days until Christmas so
all you're going to need is some
cardstock with the templates printed out
on them some scissors some double-sided
tape and then some candy of your choice
so first you want to print off the
templates I will have the link down
below to them and then you're just gonna
cut them out like so around the edges
and also make sure you're cutting the
little lines around the sides if you
know what I mean and then you're just
gonna fold at the places right here that
I have marked off until it forms a box
and then use your double-sided tape to
tape the box together and then add your
little candy inside tape it close and
you can arrange them into a tree
formation like so and tape them down or
pin them down and there you have a super
cute DIY advent calendar so that's
everything that I have to show you guys
and again it's Thanksgiving so leave me
down below what you are most thankful
for I love to read all the comments of
all the thankfulness that is going
around you should definitely go watch my
last video it was a guy girl lookbook so
I showed some guy outfits and some girl
outfits for fall and I had so much fun
filming that and the background was
beautiful so definitely check that out
and I'll see you guys my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
