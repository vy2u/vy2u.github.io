boyfriend you're not going to enjoy it I
don't choose to participate in underage
drinking
hi guys my name is Michelle Reid and if
you just clicked on this video about to
be a senior in college and I go to the
Kings College in New York City I know
around the summer time before I started
going to school for my first year I was
so nervous about so many different
things so I wanted to do this video
which is basically kind of like a
Survival Guide about things that I feel
like you should know before you go to
college your freshman year I asked for
questions on my Instagram as always that
Michelle read just cuz I wanted to kind
of get a gist of what you guys actually
wanted me to talk about I've done a lot
of college videos I don't want to repeat
myself I want to answer new questions so
I figure this is the best way to do that
let me know down below if you're going
to be a freshman what school you are
going to how do you recommend deciding a
major what if the major you spent two
years working towards isn't working well
now you need to start fresh and with a
new one so I really like this question
because I want to say if you aren't
worried about majors if you are worried
that you're gonna pick the wrong thing
and totally end up in the complete
opposite area of what you want to be in
life don't worry I don't think I've ever
really met someone unless they're in a
science or a math field that actually
kind of has a job that relates to their
major I'm just a general business
management degree so I'm not like a
marketing major or a PR major social
media major but long term I see myself
doing social media marketing your major
doesn't have to be exactly what you want
to do obviously if you want to be a
nurse or if you want to be a doctor if
you want to be an engineer those are
things that your degree should probably
orient it around find the general field
that you would like to be in whether
that be business or math or science and
then go forward after that that's about
going to college with the boyfriend back
home
I think this varies from person to
person I'm not gonna tell you to break
up with your boyfriend I'm not gonna
tell you to stay with your boy if you're
close enough to make it work I think
that it's definitely possible a lot of
people do it in general you change so
much in college it may sound cliche but
that is so true I am NOT the person at
all that I was my senior year of high
school like looking back on it I was
totally totally different and I think
it's hard whenever you're in a
relationship with someone and you are
going through all those changes make
sure you talk about it beforehand make
sure you're upfront with the person that
you're dating is saying like hey look I
might change I'm in college and if
you're not there that might be something
that's difficult but if you really truly
love someone and you feel that you're
mature enough and that you're at the
point of your life where you're not
gonna change that much I would say to go
for it how was the first day of classes
and the difference coming from high
school I'm gonna insert a picture my
first day of class I so remember taking
this her safe class is honestly really
good it got a pretty small college so it
still felt small and tight-knit
it was so nice and college only having
like two or three classes in a day going
from having to go to school from seven
hours to probably being at school like
five hours obviously depending on your
schedule you're probably to me at school
a lot less in college that is so nice
but I was definitely intimidated college
classes are a lot different and
depending on how big your school is it
may be more interactive and discussion
based I was definitely nervous my first
day of college but the nerves definitely
do go away someone asked what my
expectations versus reality of college
were and I think I'm gonna go through a
few one I expected that I would be
eating super unhealthy I'd be eating
like pizza for dinner every single night
that kind of thing and I would be so
stressed I wouldn't have time to do
anything people handle stress different
ways obviously but I was able to keep
eating healthy or as I did in high
school I also expected that guys are
gonna be a lot more mature in college
and this is a thing I can do a whole
video on I think you have this
expectation that oh like college is
where people meet their future husbands
that kind of thing and while I love my
boyfriend and I think he is super mature
and he is a man and I love him so much
I lied all guys are like that and most
of them honestly aren't one expectation
I had was that I would be too
intimidated to ask professors questions
I think before going into college I
thought there was this weird divide
between you and your professor and you
were kind of separate you didn't
interact but especially my college that
was so not true people go into office
hours all the time people email their
professors all the time people like go
over for dinner with their professors
and the relationship between you and
your professors is a lot more intimate
and
that you really are there to learn from
them and they actually like to help you
how to make the best out of a college
experience you weren't really expecting
and she went on and talked about how she
was going to a school that she didn't
really expect to go to and I'm sure
that's a lot of people watching this
video you know maybe you didn't get into
the school that you dreams about and
you're going to your second choice and
you're not that excited about school
the thing about experiences is
experiences are only what you make out
of them if you go into college with this
attitude of this isn't where I want to
be this is not the place for me you
don't give it a try you're not going to
enjoy it
you're just not whether you're going to
an Ivy League school and it's your dream
place or you're going to Community
College you can have the same college
experience as someone else as long as
you make it what you want it to be for
me I'm a really quiet person I really
introverted and honestly going to
college really scared me at first but
that first semester I threw myself into
everything I joined a club I was hanging
out with people all the time which like
me now like oh my gosh Michelle I never
hang out with people as much as I did
that obviously sticking to my morals and
being wise you guys know me I like to
keep things pretty classy but yeah you
just go to try things and you got to go
in like full fledge and do it because if
you don't and you sit back in your room
yeah you're not gonna like College what
do you think are the most effective ways
of studying like reading making study
guides quizlets etc I would definitely
say that making quizlets is super duper
smart and you C's in high school too and
one of my week in my life videos I kind
of talked about my method if you want to
watch it basically what I do for a test
is I make a Quizlet and I will make like
long quizlets I will go through it
completely and then I will go through it
again and write everything out I'm
someone who has to write things out to
memorize them I forgot what the name of
that learning technique is I can't just
read my notes and memorize them
sometimes you have to literally talk to
yourself in your dorm I did that I would
not recommend using other people's study
by unless they're just additional things
that you want to learn from but don't
just expect that someone study guides
gonna work exactly for you because
chances are this person missed something
chances are they learn differently than
you what's the biggest tip you have for
keeping in touch with friends from high
school I'm gonna be honest with you guys
I'm not a professional at this my only
friends I really kept in close touch
with is rose and Sebastian they're too
right but besides that I didn't really
keep up with most of my friends from
high school I think before you go to
college you have to tell yourself that
that's not anything personal people just
change they go in different environments
and sometimes if you're feeling like
things are force between friendships you
know what's the point of really keeping
up with those if you have a best friend
that goes to another school then that's
totally understandable like keep up with
them FaceTime them a lot text them a lot
but the thing is college is so
overwhelming and so busy that for the
most part I think a lot of your high
school friends probably won't stay super
close with you but that's okay I don't
really have any regrets I love my
friends from high school and I think you
have different friends and Nickel phases
of your life but there are a few friends
that you really keep around I'm someone
who values having a small friend group
and really staying in touch with them
versus having like a lot of friends she
basically said that she has different
morals that a lot of people at the
college she's going to she says there's
a huge hook-up and drug alcohol culture
that she's I want to participate in and
kind of ask for advice and if you guys
don't know me you don't know my story I
don't choose to participate and underage
drinking I don't really choose to
participate in a hookup culture I'm
saving myself for marriage I think it's
actually so easy in college not to
participate in those things yeah I mean
it's simple it's just saying no to those
things and if you're someone who even
just being around them kind of feeds the
temptation of wanting to participate in
those things then don't go don't go to
the party
don't go hang out with that guy but
sometimes I think that you are capable
enough to be able to say no to things
and still go to the party or still go
hang out with the guy and if that's you
then that's you and you do I think you
just have to really know yourself before
you go to college I don't have any
regrets from not for taking in those
things in college I'm not shaving anyone
for their decisions I'm just personally
talking about mine and I'm helping this
girl out by saying these things every
time I talk about this I always get
people who kind of shame me for saying
not to party or not to do this I'm not
telling anyone what to do this is just
simply my opinion so I got a question on
tips on connecting with your roommate
especially if you have never met before
I think this is the last one I'm gonna
answer so I have had three different
roommates in college and my biggest
advice would be you don't have to be
best friends with the people that you're
rooming with
and if you kind of try to force that
it's probably not gonna work and just
being courteous to your roommate you
know picking up after yourself asking
them how their day was respecting their
wishes for the room like if they want to
go to bed at a certain time you know be
courteous to that whenever you have a
mutual understanding of what respect is
it makes being a good roommate a lot
easier
prioritize time to get out of your room
and go do stuff with them I think that
brings a friendship to a whole different
level especially between roommates when
you're not just hanging out in your room
and you're actually going out or that
first semester whenever you're hanging
out with people invite your roommate IRA
mate Lauren my freshman year of college
B did a lot of stuff together our first
semester of college because we were
constantly inviting each other to things
so whenever I would go with friends I'd
be like hey Lauren do you want to come
with me
I mean we do stuff together and I think
that's a really really good way to a
meet people and be be friendly to your
roommate and actually incorporate them
into you know your college experience so
those are the questions I'm gonna answer
for this video I hope this helped you
out if you're a freshman don't worry you
will learn new things but like any
experience it is what you put into it to
make it good and give any other college
recommendations leave them down below I
love you all so much and I'll see you
guys my next video bye friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
