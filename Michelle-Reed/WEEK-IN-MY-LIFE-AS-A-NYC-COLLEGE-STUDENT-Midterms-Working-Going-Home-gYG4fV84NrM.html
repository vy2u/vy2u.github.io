starting to speak in my life video my
name is Michelle Rhee I go to the Kings
College in New York City I hope you guys
enjoy this making my life video make
sure to subscribe if you are new and you
have never been on my channel my friend
Carson has a gym so I'm going to workout
at her gym right now but just like 10
minutes away
so guys Nala and I made these actually
not Jimmy these are from Trader Joe's
but we've never had these and so I'm
about to take the first bite and I'm
really excited and she put blueberries
in them what's the verdict mmm
especially with the maple syrup guys if
you're ever at Trader Joe's
yeah the coconut pancake mix so for my
outfit today I have on this little like
turtleneck crop top with a black skirt
and some sheer tights my Naturalizer
boots and then this super big comfy
cardigan which I got from Urban
Outfitters I really like it because it
feels like a giant blanket also just got
these little hoops made well and so I
also have those I feel like on the way
to the gym I didn't really talk that
much but basically this is a week in my
life in college video and I have
midterms this week so it's gonna be like
a midterm focused one I have class every
single day Monday through Friday today I
have class
at 1:30 and then I have class at 4:30
and so I'm gonna be at school for pretty
much most of the day and then after that
I'm studying because I have my corporate
finance test on Tuesday right now it is
like 11:20 and so I'm gonna be here for
like a few more minutes and I'm gonna go
ahead and head out to go to school I
have to commute because I live in
Brooklyn
currently picking up some dinner at the
grocery store I just got back from class
which was really good but I'm like so
tired but I wanted to make like a really
healthy dinner and eat a lot of
vegetables it's feel like I've got
vegetables in a wine I got some couscous
low-sodium veggie broth I've always
wanted to try the dr. McDougall soup and
so I got some for like later this week
then I got a zucchini and green pepper
tomatoes lemon cilantro a red pepper and
squash let's go
dinner is served
so I just finish eating my dinner which
was so good now I'm in the basement
right now which is just like a room and
our apartment building that's honestly
kind of not cute and there's also not
heat down here so it's really cool I
have my test at 9 a.m. tomorrow so I'm
about to study for like four hours it's
the next day and I actually just got
back from my test it was during my 9:00
a.m. so now it's like 10:45 I just go
back to my apartment and I don't think
it went the best it could have gone but
it didn't go awful and I was expecting
awful and so honestly I'm like pretty
content with it and it's also so nice
outside it's like 55 degrees there are
birds chirping the Sun is out I hate
when youtubers do this but I'm about to
do I'm going to like an event you want
to see pictures from you can try out my
Instagram but they told me I couldn't
vlog it which I don't really know why
they're also paying for me to Eber which
is such a luxury guys whenever you take
the subway everywhere I literally never
uber I'm gonna show you guys what I'm
wearing though because this is probably
my favorite outfit I've worn in a while
I'm wearing the same little Madewell
earrings this crop top is from brandy
melville and then my pants guys are just
these plaid Urban Outfitters pants and I
just think that they are so freakin cute
especially whenever it is warmer outside
public desire boots which I also really
like having belongs in a while but
basically I went to that event but just
really fun but it's still like work to
my marketing class
I just got home after that I had to go
pick up something after and I'm just so
tired and everything in my being wants
to just sit and like watch Netflix but I
have a paper that's due Thursday that I
need to start some a proposal due
Thursday that needs to be turned in a
couple hours if you have a worship down
in the basement of my buildings my whole
building is people at my school and then
I think I'm gonna go for a walk with
Aidan because I really miss him and get
caught up on everything we've missed and
each other's lives and so just lift up
my leftovers and I'm about to start this
essay even though I really don't want to
so I've written about half of this paper
and then I also went to our worship line
which is really really good I'm about to
go for a walk with Eden vlogs so I just
got into bed and I think I'm going to
watch a documentary and then I'm gonna
hit the hay I'm actually going to a
mosque tomorrow for my historical
theology class sure that will be
interesting obviously a my kind of vlog
and a mosque you guys tomorrow so we're
trying to say and I got up a little bit
ago it's about 10:15 and right now I'm
trying to figure out what I should wear
to the mosque today I'm just a little
afraid I'm not gonna like have the right
stuff to wear because my professor told
us that you basically have to dress
modestly need to wear a headscarf all my
pants are pretty tight and so I don't
know if I can wear tight pants but it's
okay so this is what I decided on I also
have a jacket because my pants are kind
of tightly we'll see
so just got back to the mosque which was
I really got experience definitely very
informative and I'm glad that we went I
was gonna go straight to the school
after and start reading on my paper but
the Sun was just beautiful today it's
all I like went back home like watch
this on and it was so pretty at two
papers to write and they were start
studying for a quiz it'll be a busy
night to show you guys I'm about to try
this tortilla soup from dr. mcdougal
that's like vegan and it's supposed to
be pretty good not really a ramen kind
of girl but like a second college I
should like this kind of stuff it was
very good I can never find tortilla soup
it doesn't have chicken I would
recommend Thursday and I am headed to
the gym right now it's like 8 a.m. and
I'm so tired
I am currently at school right now I'm
here with Madeline right now we were
just filming a podcast for w fu V we're
at school right now but it's gonna be
coming out in May you guys on the break
yeah it's called on the brink and she's
awesome she's doing great too it was
really fun it is 10:00 p.m. right now I
have had such a long day I like went and
worked out at 8:00 I went to class I
studied I went to my other class I had
an interview for that podcast which I'm
really excited to come out and I'm just
drained I'm so ready for spring break
I'm going home this weekend and I'm so
excited honestly this is just gonna be
one of those dates that I don't really
follow the lies and so I will catch you
guys tomorrow I have my last midterm
tomorrow and I'm just ready to have a
nice date night - today is Friday and
I'm so so happy because I leave tomorrow
and like it's just gonna be a really fun
day I just got back for my 9:00 a.m.
class which is so good except the
weather today is like super windy and
it's rainy / sleety getting brunch with
my friend Rose recording - this really
cute place and then I have my midterm at
3:00 which I'm feeling pretty ok about
and then afterwards I'm hanging out with
my boyfriend and then we're just gonna
like do some fun stuff Nadja is supposed
to go to Spain and she is supposed to
leave tomorrow but there's really bad
summer outside so like long story short
she can't fly standby so what did she do
she booked a flight to Russia it's at
2:00 p.m. it's 11:15 right now she's
literally packing in 15 minutes to go to
Spain she's a know what she pack russia

very stress is me out I think this
highlights how different we are I'd be
like okay I'm not going not just like
okay I'm going to Russia if any viewers
are in Moscow yeah let me know you'll
get a stamp in your passport
so I got back from brunch with rose
which was really good if you're ever in
the city you should definitely go to it
it's called hole in the wall I also took
my marketing midterm and that went worse
than I thought
I thought that was gonna be pretty easy
but it actually like kind of tripped me
up I came home to a package and this is
actually from the company blank will and
they're not sponsoring this video but
they just asked me if I wanted to try
something out basically if you've never
heard of it blank will is a company that
sells weighted blankets that are meant
for people who have trouble sleeping
while you have anxiety they're supposed
to make you sleep better just like the
added ways you guys watch my vlogs which
if you don't it's Michelle out of your
shell and you definitely should I talked
about how much trouble I have sleeping
