it for the YouTube guys so right now I'm
about to go to class but I have to turn
in a paper really fast does anyone else
get super anxious before they turn in
papers I'm like oh I don't like it I
feel like okay about it but I just don't

her stuff right now we are about to get
on the bus to go to Vermont with
skedaddle
I don't think I explained what skedaddle
is but it's basically like a bus service
where you can do cool laying with other
people to go to different locations so
they have a lot of different locations I
think there's like 25 people going to
Mouse know today so I'm gonna be super
fun but we're leaving at 6:00
I just got here with Naja
and we are getting like our rentals and
stuff figured out or we're about to go

bought child pants because know they're
like boy pants right now it's like three
o'clock we are currently at the
Hermitage we're about to go take some
pictures and stuff but skiing guys I'm
not gonna lie it was really hard and I
did not have to but it was my
first time it was a great time and it
was just like kind of stressful and I
not gonna lie I don't really like it but
I feel like I do it a lot I like it but
it's been fun this place is so nice

self timer pictures and we're trying to
get a jumping picture it's not work if

quality water eyes look at this nice bed

bathroom this shower oh my gosh guys

been so fun even though I didn't like
skiing
I like the amenities and I'm just I'm so
good for going on a sleigh ride tonight
like hot hot tubby we're getting hot
chocolate skedaddle has treated us so
well
I'm never gonna want to skedaddle I want
to see we're about to kind of refresh
cuz I'm literally still wearing like
musky clothes right now and even though
I didn't bring many other options I'll
have the links down below

as well as the Hermitage or Hermitage in
place that we actually skied at so if
you want to check them out they're both
super nice if you are in Vermont so we
just got on the bus and we are going on
a sleigh ride soon and I know the moment
