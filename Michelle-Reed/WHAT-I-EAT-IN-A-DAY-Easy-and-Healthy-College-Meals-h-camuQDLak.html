today's video I'm going to be sharing
with you guys my favorite healthy
college recipes are super easy to make
if you live in a dorm or an apartment it
is also kind of why I eat in a day video
kind of a healthy version because this
is something that I would eat completely
in a day I have breakfast lunch dinner
and then I also have a snack included as
I want to know that I know a lot of
people subscribe to different diets
within your vegan vegetarian paleo
whatever it may be and you can
definitely change any of these things to
fit your preferences I personally just
don't eat meat because I don't find that
I need it and I don't find that it makes
me feel any better please be respectful
to everyone in this video please don't
go down below and just like leave rants
is just what I'm saying I think works
for me works for me in college let's go
ahead and get right into the video
so for breakfast I'm starting off with
this really yummy peanut butter banana
smoothie and so good I'm just using a
little bit of cocoa powder some almond
milk peanut butter frozen bananas and
basically I just put in my frozen
bananas do a scoop of peanut butter and
some almond milk then I just blend it up
and put it in a cup garnish with some
bananas and coconuts ease and there you
have a really easy smoothie recipe for
lunch I am making this really good
avocado tomato mozzarella sandwich I'm
using some wheat bread some lettuce some
avocado some mozzarella cheese tomato
basically all I do is toast up my bread
and then I just cut up all of my
ingredients on my cheese my lettuce my
tomatoes and avocado then I just take my
bread out and I like to put it on the
avocado first kind of make it like a
spread on top of it and then I put on
the tomatoes the cheese which you can
skip if you're dairy-free and there you
have a really easy healthy maslow
sandwich for my snack I've been loving
just doing some almond butter on top of
some apples with some coconut C's all
you do is use an apple some coconut and
almond milk almond butter and basically
all I do is spread my almond butter on
my apples and then I just sprinkle on a
little bit of coconut on the apples not
too much it's a really really filling
snack that's really easy to do
especially in college for dinner I love
this stuff sweet potato it's so
delicious and filling all you need is a
sweet potato refried black beans corn
Greek yogurt and some taco seasoning
green onions and then also some cilantro
basically I just stabbed my potato put
it in the oven for I think about 45
minutes at like 425 and then I cut up my
cilantro and it make a really nice
healthy sour cream all I do is blend up
Greek yogurt and a tiny bit of taco
seasoning it's really good it tastes
like sour cream that's a lot better for
you and then I just heat up my beans and
my corn on the stove until they're nice
and warm I also added some garlic powder
and chili powder to season them and then
I just take my potato out of the oven
and I cut it and stuff it with the corn
mixture I also add a little bit of the
sour cream the fake sour cream that is
and then some cilantro and green onions
and there you have a really really easy
stuffed sweet potato so really hope you
