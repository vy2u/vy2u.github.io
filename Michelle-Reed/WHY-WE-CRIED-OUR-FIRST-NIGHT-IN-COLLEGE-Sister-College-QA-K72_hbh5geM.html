always ask for Q&amp;amp;A and I went to school
oh okay hey guys I'm so classrooms video
is going to be a college and school
related Q&amp;amp;A with my sister's this is
Lindsay that going to Jamie
try to always request me to do videos to
them so we thought that we would sit
down and hold this video if you knew I
cannot make sure to leave down below
where you're going to school and also a
great are going to be in cuz I'd love to
hear it and also subscribe if you're new
I also have four questions on my
Instagram so if you wanna be featured in
the next Q&amp;amp;A make sure to follow my
Instagram at Michelle reads what to look
for when you're touring colleges as a
prospective student I feel like when
you're walking on like a college
campuses you can go kind of get like an
overall vibe for the school I know what
I like and what I don't like and so when
you walk on the campus either cut it
feels pieces that where you do I think
so about like how you feel and just I
see it's like you like a gift to walk a
lot make sure like you take that into
account like oh it's a really big campus
and not to walk a lot if you like that
or not I don't think I'm gonna fight
because I'm just looking at the videos
for acute phobia wall work obviously if
your tour guides are not very friendly
that's going to give you terms like only
the heaviest people are your tour guides
yeah or not then that should be a red
line yeah what is their biggest advice
for applying for and choosing a college
I hear like a lot that your essay
means a lot actually no cuz I was just
watching Gilmore Girls right but that's
what you know they need to be like don't
do the qui what they want to hear
like a lot of people focus on like
joining random clubs and stuff but
honestly this pronoun can help you as
much as like doing one thing doing it
really well that like makes you stand
out and like writing about that in your
essay instead of writing like and I was
in all of these clubs because like
chances are everyone else Appliance
probably in the same club so I find
something that makes you different that
you did and then really like
that up what was it like the first night
in your dorm freshman gym there's a lot
of it well I feel like I had like two
different experiences to be a first
semester I went to a different College
in Ohio and then I came back and went to
a different meal in the spring of that
year but ever I first met was really
weird because you had just moved your
stuff in college I was a stranger my
roommate was really nice but it's still
remote very homesick that first yeah
that one I had moving to roll with the
weirdo
we all went really far away so cuz we
all got a little whatever neukölln to
go home definitely cried my first night
yeah I didn't know that is how fun cuz
it's like when they anyway they'll leave
and start driving back and you're just
like there and I had two roommates in a
little shoebox yeah so I was on the top
bunk of sharing a bunk bed with another
girl and what I always tell people is
you learn the silent crying college how
to silent cry today I know crying yeah I
think I sprayed my first day off to you
but I wasn't like a being a cry just
like a couple tears I don't think I
slept the first time cuz they're really
good at sleeping in general what are
some tips to stay sane sharing such a
small dorm room with other people no Joe
saying that like my roommate morning I
did it's like when I agree was like
watch videos or something or Netflix
we'd like make sure to put headphones in
this is like a small thing but it can
really drive you nuts and like someone's
watching a show that you really don't
like it can kind of drive you nuts so if
you're trying to like read or something
in someone's like where you're watching
Gilmore Girls or something establish at
the beginning like what specific really
rules but nothing yeah like if you don't
want people coming over like half of
their time or if you like don't want
someone bringing someone over let make
sure you say that at the beginning
because if you don't it gets like really
weird and like 10 just don't like share
Jamie very confrontational socially way
that's why I would say my burnings were
awesome freshman year but I had friends
that were across the hall that like that
where they just had really bad
grooming and they would complain to me
about them but then they won't say
anything to them I think that's the
thing they're not going to know if you
don't help me doing it right when you
get there and doing hey this is where
this is going to be where my stuff is
that's also really good I feel like
having a roommate that you don't know at
first is actually better because if you
can say those things upfront and like
it's not like into your best friend
through the past five years so it would
be like harder to bring stuff up and I
roomed with my best friend when I went
into an apartment and we still had to
sit down and like say hey this is what I
cannot stay in and this is what one of
my things is being really loud in the
morning although I say like just
encouraging each other it helps you stay
sane and realizing that both of you are
going to do things that annoy each
others would be done like a mutual
respect for each other and you encourage
each other it makes for a better llege
environment yeah what if I asked you
have for someone who has no idea what
they want to do with their life how do
you find your true passion in the
profession you want to major in I would
say you're not alone so you're not the
only person that has gone through that
and even when you think you know exactly
what you want to do sometimes that can
completely change I was to school to
study worship to start with and then
came back home and studied social work I
will say if you have no idea what to do
I was considered going to look at
Community College before because it's
really expensive that is something that
you're not really sure about and so you
can get all of your like prereqs Dillon
before in your basics done before going
into you know what you really want to
study I was I think that's for like
internships health to some other people
all told me anything yet like you don't
really know if you're like good at
something or you like actually doing
something like work why did you actually
like try it out so like making sure you
do unpaid internships or paid ones and
just kind of figuring that out I don't
stress out too much because I know like
parents as my friends that like major is
something like English and now they're
like flight attendants or something like
that and they won't what they do so I
don't think you should stress out I
think a college degree is something that
that is important to have us like
something that you should be proud of
even if you don't end up using exactly
that in your job someday
this is pray about it at times you have
you have all these fears and worries and
they come to mind but it can pray about
it you'll have a little bit more
guidance going into taking what kind of
entity if a four year college
worth it is it worth this debt and
everything because I don't think that a
college degree has that much value
anymore Angie says she wants to be an
entrepreneur so she just felt like it
wasn't necessary feel like it's very
because even our dad he's really smart
and he had a degree but he even and use
like a PE of this company so those are
the shelves called where they just get
technical skills and then goes like what
do you get illegal technique just like
you hear Kiva says that's like something
that a lot of people need nowadays but a
lot of people don't have so I think it
just goes with who you are but you're
the one who's paying for it I think you
really have to judge like if it's going
to be worth is it like I know wise
you're going to find they're like
$50,000 schools and are paying it paying
for it like by themselves and it's like
when you come out you're not like
$200,000 is dead you just have to be
like is this worth the investment like
you're going to be a doctor or you see
yourself like being really successful
and if you're wanting to do something
that maybe isn't like it's high of a pay
like maybe it says it I know people that
are like nurses or went to nursing
school and I was almost crazy to spend
so much money to do that but that was
their passion so they had it took that
risk of I will take the debt in order to
pursue my passion all of that did not
have to pay for school but ya know they
were all very thankful it's I guess
friend as a hairdresser credible at what
she does
yeah if you are like paying for your
college and you don't want to have that
like make different life changes to
where else you can save money like we're
sitting here are our parents pay for
college but like we never went on trips
we like don't spend alone we don't go to
fancy dinners
made certain like decisions so we could
all wear the colleges that we wanted to
and not melt dead I thank you prioritize
and that was a framework for them for us
yeah and so I'm like yeah I'm still
thinking I much rather come out that
Friedan like how awesome
yeah purple yellow by my friend for you
and we have really great grandparents
too and they also sacrificed them yeah
being a Christian and like having morals
were you ever like tested to do
something that you didn't want to do in
college I think you just have to be if
you're in the word day leaving your mind
on something else besides that and your
song creating yourself I just I don't
think you even want to do that you kind
of know like no living in New York I was
like so in a sense and like they would
have like alcohol or and walk and be
listen to this cocktail I think about
the only time I like tested but I don't
know like laundromat thing I went to
everyone's drinking there people like
danced all the bars and oh boy well I
don't like to not be in control of what
I'm doing if you have a good community
of people around you a good circle of
friends and that kind of have the same
morals of you it can help you yeah I had
I had my boyfriend Ben who literally I
mean he has the same morals and faith as
I do so I didn't fail maybe for any date
someone was like these name morals as
you don't like yeah I think what people
won't agree with what they are going to
be spending like the most time with them
probably and if they're like making bad
decisions and you're pointing
resolutions
those are all the questions that we're
going to answer I think we answered
quite a few so let me know if you like
this and give a thumbs up if you like my
nose to me super yummy of course my last
video links right here and I'll see you
guys in my next video also even blogging
