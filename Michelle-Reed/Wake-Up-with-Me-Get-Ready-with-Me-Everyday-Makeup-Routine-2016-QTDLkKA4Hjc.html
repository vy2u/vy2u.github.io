doing kind of a wick up with me style
video so I'm going to show you guys how
I did my hair how I do I make up one in
everyday basis I want to say thank you
to origins for sponsoring this video I
love their products guys and their masks
that I show this video is now like my
Holy Grail product and I've used it so
often on my face I just love it so I
want to say thank you to origins for
sponsoring this I blog channel I have
blog channel it's Michelle out of her
shell but a lot of my viewers on there
asking for an everyday makeup tutorial
so what I did go in like an everyday
basis and so I thought I would throw
that into this video and I really really
loved all the products that I use
everything just works so nicely together
they're just a great balance to find I
also wanted to make this video really
candid and just literally wake up and
take you guys along with me on my
getting ready process because I think
that's so much fun and it was just a lot
of fun to film if you're new to my
channel you should subscribe I upload on
Sundays and Thursdays and yeah so I
think that's everything that I have to
say for this intro so let's just go
ahead and get into the getting ready
with me part so when I first get out of
the shower I like to use my mask oh
miser mask primer from origins this is a
super new product and it's the first
ever mask primer and it basically
Prime's your skin before you apply a
mask to make sure it hydrates and
softens and conditions how it's supposed
to basically you spray it over your face
let it dry and Pat it in and it's super
cool I'll have it linked down below
along with a really cool giveaway this
is available at Sephora on February 12th
so you should check it out I'm also
using the charcoal mask which is
phenomenal it clears my pores and it
just works so well the two together are
perfect and they prep my skin for makeup
and I honestly love them so much then
I'm using my simple skincare moisturizer
to moisturize my face it's a really
great product it really moisturizes my
skin for hair all I use is my red kin
color extended shampoo and conditioner
and then my macadamia deep repair mask
her makeup I first like to use my
Smashbox photo finish primer and light
to get my skin ready for makeup
it makes my foundation look so much
better then I'm using my naked skin
foundation which is so natural and glowy
guys I've been loving this foundation it
is perfect and it matches me perfectly I
love it then I use my Maybelline to fit
me concealer underneath my eyes I just
draw a little triangle underneath my
eyes and it really highlights my face
looks great love it and then I set
everything with my Rimmel stay matte
powder lightly because I've dry skin but
just to make sure all the makeup stays
throughout the day then I am lightly
contouring my face with my hoola bronzer
I just like to do this on my cheekbones
and on my forehead because obviously I'm
quite pale but I think you should
embrace it because paleness is still
pretty and then I'm applying this NARS
blush I forgot the exact name of it but
I'll have it down below it's a really
pretty pinky mauve color it really just
makes my skin look glowy and then I'm
using my Anastasia brow powder to
lightly fill in my brows for eyes I am
priming my eyes with my NYX jumbo
eyeshadow pencil in the shade milk
really brightens my eyes that makes the
eyeshadow pop a lot more and then I'm
taking my Naked 3 palette and using the
shade Stranger all over my lid and then
I'm going in with limit which is a
really pretty ma purple color and I'm
applying this to my crease and then in
the very outer crease I'm applying the
shade nooner to kind of deepen up the
look a bit more and then in the outer
corner i am working factory all over
there to really just define the whole
look
then I'm using this shape stranger again
I'm highlighting underneath my brows and
then lightly doing a very thin line of
eyeliner with my Revlon Colorstay skinny
eyeliner and then I'm using my rocket
mascara to finish up the eye look her
lips I'm using my Burt's Bees lipstick
in the shade suede splash it is such a
pretty color and it moisturizes
literally my favorite product right now
and then I am just finishing off with my
Smashbox primer water which I'm actually
almost finished with and it's really sad
for hair we are keeping things simple
which is basically my hair motto and I'm
just straightening my hair I haven't
really been liking my hair curled lately
I just think straight hair is super
sleek and pretty and that's what I've
been doing and that's it for my get
ready with me look so that is it for
this getting ready process don't forget
