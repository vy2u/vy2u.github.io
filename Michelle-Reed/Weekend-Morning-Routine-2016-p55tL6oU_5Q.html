apartment building because I wanted to
tell you guys that you're about to watch
a weekend morning routine because living
in New York City I just wanted to show
you guys a glimpse of what my weekends
look like I also wanted a shout out
origins for sponsoring this video and
working with me guys I love origins so
much I love the brand I use their
products all the time in my videos yeah
College is crazy and it's insane and I
really like to use my weekends to just
kind of chill and relax
so I wanted to show you guys with this
video kind of how to relax and enjoy
your weekends and just have a really
really great morning because I think
that's super important as always if
you're new to my channel definitely
subscribe I upload once a week and you
should also subscribe to my blog channel
because I upload twice a week over there
and I love that channel and it's so much
fun to do that's pretty much all I have
to say so let's just go ahead and get
into the video so on the weekends I tend
to wake up at around at 9 to 9:30 and I
get to wake up to natural lighting which
is so nice I love this window above my
bed it's honestly the best thing waking
up to the light but then I just go ahead
and I go on my phone and check my social
medias I tend to not do this on the
weekdays I try to not make it a habit
but on the weekends I think it's fine
and then I just go ahead and make my bed
I always make my bed guys it's the best
way to start your day then I head on
over to the bathroom to do some skincare
I like to turn on some music so I'm
listening to this feeling good playlist
that I just made on my Spotify it'll be
linked down below if you want to check
it out I'm using a face mask this is the
ritual I tea from origins and matcha
madness it's actually part of origins
first-ever tea based collection which
has four face masks and four body masks
and basically all I have to do is mix
this up and so I use two tablespoons of
the powder and then two tablespoons of
water and then I just mix it until it's
a nice consistency this mask contains
Japanese matcha and green tea which is
super nice because it actually contains
elfia 9 which is an amino acid that
relieves stress and improves focus and
helps with the anxiety which you know
your girls in college
I need the
things so so very much so I usually like
to go make a cup of coffee and then sit
on my bed and kind of go on my laptop
and do some YouTube stuff and fun fact
guys matcha is actually highly important
in the Japanese culture and it was used
by Buddhist monks to enhance mindful
meditation and increase alertness and so
I really like to do this on the weekend
so I can get stuff done and be alert and
awake so after just journaling and going
on my laptop and doing work stuff I'll
head back into the bathroom and just
rinse off my face my skin is so smooth
and soft I absolutely love it it takes
away all the dryness so I'll have this
mask link down below you can purchase
the mask at that link or at Origin
stores again thank you so much to
origins for sponsoring this video
for makeup I'm just priming my face from
my the bomb face primer and then I just
mixed my Make Up For Ever HD foundation
with a little bit of moisturizer and I
make my own tinted moisturizer and just
blend this with my Beauty Blender then
I've been going in with my shade and
light palette and doing a nice kind of
warm toned eyeshadow look so just a
peach on the lid and then a little bit
of a burgundy color in my crease it's
kind of messy but I like it like that
and then I just apply my Maybelline
instant age rewind concealer I love the
stuff guys have used it for like two
years now and then I just set that with
my Rimmel stay matte powder and then I
set the rest of my face with my Laura
Mercier powder this stuff is great I've
been loving it lately and then I just go
in and fill in my brows with my benefit
gimme brow which really thickens up my
brows I love this product such a good
bra product and then I'm just applying
my Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer to
my cheekbones and my forehead and then
I'm going in with NARS dolce vita for
blush and then I'm just curling my
eyelashes and applying my rocket mascara
and that is pretty much it for my
weekend makeup for my hair all I do is
take out my crazy bun and I've been
doing a middle part lately which is kind
of weird but I like it and then I just
straighten my hair keep it really really
sleek and I've been really liking this
hair look and a middle part I think it
looks different for breakfast I just
made some avocado toast per usual I've
been eating this for so long now but
it's just a good way to get some new
tree
it's in and I'll usually just work on
some homework or journal during this for
my outfit I am wearing this super cute a
mustard turtleneck from a thrift store I
love it
my jeans are just high-waisted black
jeans from made well they're my staple
and then my boots are my favorite part
of this outfit I love them they are from
zoo shoe which I will have link down
below but I think they're so cute and
they just complete the outfit and for
jewelry my necklace is from Kendra Scott
and I'm wearing my favorite watch from
Daniel Wellington
so really something I enjoyed watching
this video I had so much fun filming it
here in the city it's so exciting
filming here I love it
you should also go watch my last video
it was an apartment tour of my space
here in New York

medias that will be linked right here I
love you guys so so much
