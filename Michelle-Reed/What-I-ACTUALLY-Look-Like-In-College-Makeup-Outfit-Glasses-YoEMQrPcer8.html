name is Michelle Reed and I make beauty
fashion lifestyle College video and so
today's video is really exciting so it's
going to be what I actually look like in
college now what I mean by that is I
know a lot of you guys can probably go
to school looking like this like you
just rolled out of bed which is totally
cool but I actually go to the Kings
College in New York City you guys
probably know the drill I have a
business casual dress code so I actually
have to like work to like look decent in
the morning which means doing my makeup
doing my hair putting on like a business
casual outfit I show you guys the
difference between how my school work
how I get ready in the morning if you're
new you should definitely subscribe I
post weekly and I've also been posting
every single day until Christmas vlog
miss on my blog channel I'm so excited
for this video because I'm partnering
with glasses usa.com cuz as you can see
I'm wearing some glasses in this video
and these are essential to my like
everyday routine just because I wear
glasses every single day to class which
means that they can kind of get old
wearing the same pair so when glasses
usa.com reached out to me I thought it
would be so cool to feature them in this
video so whether you wear glasses for
prescription use like myself or you wear
them for like fashion use this website
is great glasses usa.com says glasses
that are like 70% marked off of the
retail price so you get way way more
affordable glasses and you can shop for
glasses and like the comfort of your
home I know can be kind of awkward
trying on glasses like in stores and
they don't have a ton of styles but on
glasses you would say calm guys so many
styles you won't even be able to choose
if you were like me they have over like
2,500 different styles so they have
ray-bans they have Oakley one also
sunglasses that you can get a free
prescription lens included in your
sunglasses purchase they also have free
shipping and returns and a hundred
percent money-back guarantee and that is
because like obviously you may order
glasses and be like these actually
aren't that cute on me so you can send
them right back and switch them out I
thought is something that you need to do
so I have a coupon down below if you
want to check it out there also be the
link to glasses usa.com I want to go
ahead and try on all the glasses that I
ordered in case you want to see like
what Styles you may like these ones that
I'm wearing right now are the Weston
glasses and I think that they are really
really cute I think these are the best
for my face shape
they're the best for like everyday so
these phones are the muse M 309 - so
these ones are definitely a little bit
funkier I just wear these at my pass
blah I think they're really cute if I'm
wearing like high-waisted jeans with the
shirt tucked in kind of like on the
weekends more casual I also have these
funds which I wore in my study routine
video and a lot of you guys like them
they're like the classic Harry Potter
style glasses start of the Otto Sidney
ones and I just think that they are
really really cute I know these are
really in right now so if you're into
like circle glasses and circle lenses
sunglasses and these ones are basically
just really big I think that these are
so fun I always need sunglasses and so I
was so happy when they sent me these
they're also like toward a show which i
think is really nice these ones are the
Amelia II Blue Bell ones so these ones
are a little bit funky they have like a
little line and then you know but I also
think that these are really really cute
and these ones are just like your
classic Ray Ban aviators I think these
are definitely my favorite I think
they're the most like me ones and
they're kind of like a brown tan shade
and their gold so I'm gonna be wearing
these on to the moon yeah I definitely
recommend checking out glasses usa.com
just go ahead and get right into the
college look so to start off I'm just
using the Laura Mercier foundation
primer I really like the substitute
moisturizer with this some mornings when
it's like busy in the morning in college
I don't have a ton of time I think it
really works
your foundation I'm using the Too Faced
Born This Way Foundation now I don't
always wear foundation to school some
mornings they won't but if it's like a
honey rack have a little bit of time I
will go ahead and apply a little bit
powder I'm using the Maybelline fit me
powder I really think this powder is
like night your bronzer i'm using the
tarte park a princess bronzer and i self
tan so i want to go ahead and put this
like all over my face and then also
contour with it it really just warms up
your face and i think it looks nice then
i like to use my butter blush from
Physicians Formula in the shade vintage
bruge my dad's back do you mean if you
can hear that I'm sorry but then I'm
just going in with my Laura Mercier
highlighter this is in the shade in
discretion and I like to apply this on
my cheekbones my nose and my chin
so I usually don't have time to fill in
my eyebrow so I just take a spoolie and
run it through to kind of get the
foundation out and just comb them
through her eyeshadow I'm using the Too
Faced and natural eyes palette and I'm
taking this nude shade right here and
just putting it in the crease
so I'm gonna be wearing glasses I like
to keep my eyeshadow really minimal and
I would rather weigh like a bold lip or
some lipstick instead of like really
playing out my eyes just because I think
my glasses are gonna be the focus
I do wear glasses to class everyday
because I do have to see the board with
them so then I just like to take heaven
and put that underneath my browbone
eyeliner I'm using my Clinique precisely
for eyeliner and I'm just gonna like to
run a little bit of these two darker
shades on my lower lash line to kind of
open up my eyes just a little bit I'm
just curling my eyelashes and applying
my they're real mascara for a benefit I
lipstick today I think I'm gonna mix two
different shades so these are both the
Laura Mercier extreme velour matte
lipsticks and I'm gonna mix the shades
of respect and the shade is list because
I think they'll make a really pretty
like nude pink color and that is it for
the very natural makeup look
over here I keep things so natural guys
I don't really do a ton I honestly sleep
with my hair wet most of the time so it
wakes up like kind of wavy I just take
my straightener I like to put my hair
and kind of like a messy middle part as
my glasses in the morning all I do is
like straighten it once through and then
I take it and I flip it I curl it down
to where you get like a really soft wait
so as you team you're done you kind of
just like play with it and it becomes
like these really loose like pretty
waves that are kind of like messy but I
just think they're really cute for
school so this is an outfit that I would
normally wear these pants are from
forever 21 I think they're really cute
because they can kind of pass as
business casual but they're mostly just
like really comfortable pants that feel
like PJs and then I just tucked in a
black playing target top and then I just
threw on my Westen glasses and then
these boots which are from Naturalizer
but I got them from DSW and this is like
a typical outfit that I would wear to
class and it's really comfy too
so that is it for my college kind of
everyday look when I actually look like

school because I definitely be
interested in knowing I also make sure
