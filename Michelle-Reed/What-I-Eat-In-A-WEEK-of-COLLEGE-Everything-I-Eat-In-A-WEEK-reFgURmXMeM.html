my name is Michelle Reed and in today's
video I wouldn't be doing what I eat in
a week in college I've seen a lot of
videos like this for what I eat at days
but I've never seen like what I eat in a
week I thought it would be really cool
just to kind of document like a food
journal I want to practice by setting
that in my college at the Kings close we
don't have a meal plan so I cook all my
food now they're not like gourmet meals
they're pretty basic but I still try to
keep it relatively healthy I try four
80/20 70/30 also pescetarian so I don't
eat like meat besides fish not vegan if
you are being if you have different
diets that's okay this is more just for
my own knowledge to see like how I eat
it so I just thought this would be
interesting this isn't like a video me
telling you how to eat it's more for my
own knowledge but I thought it might be
cool to see you should subscribe if
you're new I post videos like this all
the time I'm trying to make more like
college fun lifestyle videos so if you
liked it make sure to subscribe also you
try to check out my blog channel I've
been logging so much it's Michelle out
of your shell you guys really seem to be
liking it so thank you guys so much
let's just go ahead and get right into
it
so that's it for what I eat in a week I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I try
to do something that's a little bit
different I think it's good to do
different things I hope you guys like
that and make sure to stay tuned for my
next video I love you guys and I'll see
you soon my friend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
