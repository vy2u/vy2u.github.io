haul video or what I got for Christmas
I'm really excited cuz I just fixed my
camera and Jamie's in the background by
the way I'm in her room because for one
the lights in my room don't work and
second my brothers living in there which
sucks so I'm filming Jamie's room so the
first thing I got my stocking was this
cup this is just a travel like coffee or
hot chocolate cup it's really pretty
powder and it's kind of like tribal yet
kind of earthy it's kind of cool I also
got a Starbucks gift card this extra
dessert the lights rainbow sherbert go
I've never had this but I got the naked
Urban Decay basics palette which has six
like a matte eyeshadows in it they're
really pretty I actually picked this up
because I really wanted this my mom got
me and Jamie both the Jesus calling
devotions because bitch I guess I do
need this cuz I haven't been doing
anything and just so got me this journal
and it's like a teal color it's leather
it's really pretty it's from Urban
Outfitters check that and it also comes
with a pencil so I thought this was
really cute for actual gifts the biggest
present that I got was a watch this is a
fossil watch it looks like that so it is
the Stella I don't know it's like this
silver Stella one but it looks like that
and it has crystals and kind of a pearl
face on it it's really pretty so this is
what the watch actually looks like on
this really
and I really like it oh I forgot to
mention I'm wearing snowflake Christmas
pants to go with that watch my mom also
picked out this bracelet she said a lot
of the girls who were working there
we're wearing them so it looks like this
it has like one paved a little stone on
it and it's leather it's really pretty
so my brother Jordan got me this curling
iron it actually had a clamp on it but I
took it off because I wanted a clamp
plus one so I took it off but it's the
hot tools 1 inch Salon curling iron
my sister Lindsay actually got me this
scarf and it's from Urban Outfitters and
it's floral and has a ton of different
colors it's really pretty and I think
this will be really nice for the
springtime Jamie actually got me this
phone case I picked it out but I really
like it it's floral and it has studs on
it and it's kind of like a matte finish
it's really pretty and I really really
like it so it came with this free case
and it's cheetah and it looks like it'd
be furry but it's not free but it's
actually kind of cute because you know
when you get free stuff it's usually
like ugly and like I would never use
this but I'd probably use this cuz
cheetah she also got me these and moroni
crew boots socks which I need some
always stealing her socks and yeah I use
from Target and then she got me two
really nice two for brushes because I
always use hers so this is the Sephora
Pro shadow looks like that these are
really really soft they go pro shadow
and then the Sephora Pro domed crease
this is my favorite one so my sister's
friend Jordan gave me this purse because
he was studying abroad in Italy so he
got me this one from Italy and it's
black it has two tassels as zippers and
it has like gold detailing it's so
pretty and it's a crossbody but it can
also be a clutch and a wristlet and I
just really like this Jamie has a brown
one and the inside looks like that so
cool
and for my relatives I just got money
and cards and such so due to my
grandparents and relatives and all that
goods my brother Derek also got me like
a travel mug but I used Excel drink you
know pepper
Bokke in it um but he also gave me this
book no comment
