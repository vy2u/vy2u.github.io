guys would like to see this and I got
like 120 favorites and so I decided that
I would just go ahead and do this I'm
very very thankful for everything that I
got and I'm not just trying to sit here
and brag
this is just requested and so I decided
to do it so the first thing that I got
was like the big thing that I asked for
that was a camera lens and this is the
Sony 50 millimeter F 1 point 8 and I
really really wanted this because I
heard it was just a nice lens and it's
really like crisp quality and it looks
so good I mean you might be wondering
well why aren't you filming with it it's
because it's a little too zoomed in to
just sit down and film but whenever I
film lookbooks and outfit videos or
fashion videos this will be really
really great it just looks so much nicer
than the standard lens and I love it so
very happy and I've already taken some
pictures and videos of it and I
absolutely love it instead of everybody
my family giving each other gifts we
just did a gift exchange and so we each
had one person and my brother Derek had
me and he got me a new tripod because
the one I'm on right now is really
really cheap and it just like breaks a
lot of times and it's really frustrating
and so he got me a nice one like this
and it's nice and sturdy and it just
works really really well and it's very
good quality and it's something I'm not
used to because mine is absolutely
terrible and it's such a pain but this
one it's just super nice and I can't
wait to use it because I've never had a
nice tripod and so it's just something
that's nice to have so thank you so much
Derek and then for my sister Lindsey I
got some candles so the first one is the
Dolce candle smells like a vanilla bean
rich caramel and fresh cream it's just a
very very sweet scent
and it smells very very good and I
absolutely love it and I cannot wait to
burn this one I might also have
champagne toast and this one's kind of
just a light sweet scent I'm probably
gonna burn this on new years because
champagne and all but it smells very
very good and I love it
just we got me a pair of fuzzy socks and
they have little bows all over them so
they're so cute and you can never go
wrong with fuzzy socks because they are
the best so thank you so much Lindsay my
sister Jamie also ordered me some stuff
but it didn't come in the mail so she
just put some pictures as we saw as I'll
show you guys I was going to wait till I
came in but I wanted to get this video
outside decides to just do it now but
she got me this necklace and it's just
pink and it has a little it's almost
like a bubble necklace but it's very
cute and I know how many coral necklaces
so that was pretty and she also got me
this really really cute um camera strap
and it's a rainbow and it has little
stitching all over and it's so cute and
I love it and I cannot wait to have it
because it's gonna make my hair look so
much better again it's so pretty so
thank you so much Jamie I cannot wait
for that stuff to come in the mail buddy

gave me this necklace and it's a bubble
necklace and it's just light blue and

he also gave me this guy and it's super
big this bear and I absolutely love them
