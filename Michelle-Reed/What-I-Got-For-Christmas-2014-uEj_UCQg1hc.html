what I got for Christmas video because

know I love watching these videos and

decided that I would do this for you

and it's a little toasty so I'm just
gonna pretend like it is the company√≠s
thing in the world even though I'm
actually sweating right now the
stockings are actually my favorite part
of Christmas so we're just gonna go
ahead and start with those I actually
asked for socks and I got a ton of socks
so we got this pair which says I have
mood swings accurate and then three
j.crew pairs this one is like a chevron
this one has stripes and this has polka
dots so I love socks and I'm so happy
this is probably the thing that I was
most excited for I also got a bracelet

favorite thumb which is the orbits sweet
mint I don't even think my mom knew this

love this and the last thing I got in my
stocking wasn't Urban Decay eyeshadow in
sin I love this because it's the only
eyeshadow I use in my Naked palette
