to all of you guys or if you don't
celebrate Christmas Happy Holidays I am
here to do what I got for Christmas
video I've done these for the past like
two or three years and they're really
just fun to look back on they're more
just for myself to like see how things
have changed but I'm not trying to brag
very grateful for everything also it
rose if you were watching this video I
promise I would give you back your
onesie someday if you're new to my
channel you should at least obscure the
button will be right here I upload every
Sunday and Thursday or Sunday or
Thursday it varies quite often but yeah
so with all my stuff being said we're
just going to go ahead and get into the
video we're gonna start off with
stocking stuffers because stockings are
my favorite part of Christmas first
favorite thing selfie stick I am really
excited about this because I have a huge
family and we can never get everyone in
our pictures and so this is gonna come
in handy I'm not just gonna take
pictures of myself for this this is
gonna be a family affair guys we got
socks socks are always super essential
these are the ones that don't show which
are my favorite awesome I've got another
pair of socks these ones say I hate
everyone too which is just funny it's
like a girl it's heading a horse talking
to the horse
I know these Smashbox photo finish
primer in the light I really like this
I've been using it a lot in my videos
recently but it's really nice nice
canvas for your makeup oh so I got a MAC
lipstick in the colour Twiggy it's the
color that I have on right now it's
super pretty and natural and I actually
picked this out and I'm really excited
cuz MAC lipsticks are awesome also got
some orbit gum because you can't have
Christmas without getting gum guys we
got a couple Starbucks gift cards
because I go through these like water
guys I drink iced coffee all the time
that's all I get at Starbucks so two
gift cards very very thankful for these
because I spend way too much money to
Starbucks and then I got these super
cute pair of sweats from Victoria's
Secret pink they're just like hot pink
sweat pants and they say pink on the
side and they're skinny I really like
these because they're the skinny
collegiate kind and they're really comfy
and they're kind of like fitting
sweatpants you can wear them and not
feel guilty so for bigger gifts this
first one is from my boyfriend Gunnar he
got me a Fossil watch that I love I said
I wanted this like two months ago and he
went out and got it in it so pretty it
almost looks like a compass but I'll do
a close-up it's like purple and pink and
pearly and silver and just SuperDuper
pretty if you know me I love watches and
I've way too many and so this is gonna
be my new favorite one for a while it is
beautiful I don't have any silver ones
so this one's really nice and the
gutters mom actually got me an Urban
Outfitters gift card which I spend is so
much money Urban Outfitters I buy like
all my clothes there so I'm so excited
to use this and do some shopping so
exchange two gifts with my friend of
Rose and she got me this super comfy
neutral blanket scarf because the
blanket scarf I have is really colorful
so this one's gonna match with a lot
more stuff but it's so warm and cozy and
then she also got me the black opium
perfume from Yves Saint Laurent which is
so good guys it smells awesome
it's very more mature because I feel
like you kind of grow out of that sugary
sweet scent and this one is still sweet
but it's a little more grown-up so
really really excited about this my
sister Lindsay I'll be the coolest gifts
they're like Instagram pictures that you
print out and so I have a ton there's
like some approxi something Gunnar
Gunnar me just like all of my pictures
all in these really cool cardstock
floors and they're all so is so cute and
I'm so excited to put these up on my
bulletin board because they're adorable
and I just think it's the coolest gift
ideas she also got me a nice new camera
strap for my camera because the one I
have is just the boring one that it
comes with but this one is super cool
and as techie and just really awesome
because obviously I'm always using my
camera so it's nice to have a little
personal touch to it so the two big
things that I got from my parents were
one my cartilage piercing which is right
there you would know this if you watch
my vlog i vlogs the whole thing so you
should definitely subscribe to my blog
channel honestly blogs or so much fun
and you get to kind of know me more so
you definitely check that out but yeah
I've got my cartilage piercing because I
really like like having my whole ear
pierced not that I'm actually gonna do
that but I kind of like that look and I
just thought this would be a nice
and then I also got new glasses but I
haven't actually gotten those yet I just
went and picked out some frames because
I picked those really thick black ones
back in the day and now that I'm
actually like using I'm like these are
not the most flattering glasses and so I
just got a new pair and I'm really
excited for those this is another gif
that actually blogged about but these
are some Clarke desert codes from women
these are definitely not for everyone
I will admit not everyone's gonna like
these but they look like this
they're super cute and just nice for the
winter time and maybe like early spring
they're like suede super nice very very
well made and I think they're really
cute and I do video styling these
because they are kind of different shoes
but I just thought they would go with
everything and I don't have a whole lot
of shoes these are nice to add to my
collection my laptop charger also fried
and so we got a new laptop charger
because I definitely need this I'm
literally always on my laptop with
YouTube and editing and so this is just
so nice to get because it's something
you don't want to buy these are really
expensive and you don't want to use your
own money so are so thankful that they
thought to get me this and I believe
this is the last thing that I have to
show you guys but this is a cardigan
it's a really pretty
oatmeal colored cardigan that kind of
goes down about quarter length sleeve
and it kind of flies out around the
edges super soft and comfortable because
it's from brandy melville you know it's
gonna be soft and I love me some brandy
guys so those are all the things that I
got definitely leave down below what
your favorite gift that you got for
Christmas because I love seeing what
other people got and just seeing you
know how your Christmas was I'm so
thankful for everything I'm so grateful
for Christmas it's so grateful for Jesus
Christ and the reason for the season and
I hope you guys just had a great holiday
now all that Christmas is over you're
gonna have to figure out something to
work for New Year's so you should go

complete hair make up an outfit video so
