this video because I'm going to be
showing you guys what I wore in kawaii
with my boyfriend on vacation if you're
new you should definitely hit that
subscribe button my name is Michelle
Reid and I post all the time here in the
summertime so you should definitely hit
that button down below so for my first
outfit I wore this dress which is so
comfy I think wrap dresses are so cute
because they really cinch in your waist
they make you look nice this one is from
Francesca's it also had a really pretty
like palm trees on it which is perfect
for vacation I also just wore my aviator
sunglasses from Ray Bans which I
personally really really enjoy I also
tried to do this really cute like
opening the curtain thing that totally
failed and I looked really creepy so I
also posted a ton of pictures in these
outfits on my social media if you want
to check it out it's at Michelle Reed or
at Michelle Reed YT so this next dress
is actually my favorite I think it's so
cute is also from Francesca's and I
think the ties on the shoulders are just
adorable and it's so flowy I just feel
like a fairy princess Island something
wearing this I thought it was really
really cute and I like how its inches in
the waist as well I also wore this to
the loo aisle that we went on which was
so much fun I got to see all the culture
of Hawaii it was so so much fun for
these next clips
I apologize they're really really bright
because it was super sunny but I thought
the rocks were still really pretty I
just wore this black maxi dress which I
got from Nordstrom Rack and it was so
comfortable maxi dresses are the best
because they just feel like giant
blankets but they're also very cool to
like walk around in
it's very breezy I love it I'm also
wearing this hat which is so cute as
well it's also from Nordstrom Rack but
it is the brand Steve Madden I just saw
it kind of gave this more of a tropical
look and I also danced like a dork
wearing this so it's great for dancing
and for my last outfit I just wore this
romper I think it's so cute also from
Francesca's I think the little flowers
on it are adorable and it was so so
comfortable I just threw my hair in a
French braid which is honestly the first
time I learned how to French braid my
hair so I was really proud and I'm just
wearing these old navy sandals which I
thought gave it a cute pop of color I
actually wore this when we went biking
along the code
it was so comfortable and breezy and
literally the perfect biking outfit I
absolutely loved this and that is it for
my outfits video I also would love to do
a modest swimsuit video so if you'd like
to see that let me know down below I
love you guys funny lookin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
