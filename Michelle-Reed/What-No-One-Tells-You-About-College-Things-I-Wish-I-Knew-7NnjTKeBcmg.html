lens so why this is so weird
I'm just letting to switch off between
this one and my normal one so if you're
like me I hate this one it will not be
here permanently I mainly got this lens
actually for vlogging so you guys just
subscribe to my vlog channel cuz I've
long doing - looking a little bit better
because it's a Sun you don't know who I
am my name is Michelle Reed I make
videos on beauty fashion and lifestyle
and College videos which is what today's
video is I'm be coming with you guys
coming you guys things that I was
telling you about College you're like
going into college there were just so
many things that I was not prepared for
and no matter how many YouTube videos I
watch I just feel like I learned so many
different things that no one really told
me you're going to college let me know
where you're going also I'd love to hear
I'm going to be a sophomore next year go
to Kings College in New York City let's
go ahead and get into it
College can get really really lonely I
feel like they're kind of dismiss
consumption that in close you're always
meeting new people and going to cool
events and doing these cool activities
and go into really cool parties oh
what's this one I feel like college can
get really really lonely there are so
many times where I just felt like I
didn't have friends I didn't have my
family or just some nice where I was
just sitting and my tiny little studio
apartment I just felt really really
really lonely which i think is fine I
think you can't always be like with
people with doing stuff so I think it's
okay but at the same time I feel like
it's good to know that you don't so far
the college you're going to get lonely
but it's okay a lot of times I can feel
like you're never quite doing enough in
college people are always getting like
really cool internships really cool jobs
getting really great grades and I feel
like a lot of times my freshman year of
college or to Sony moments where I was
like I'm not doing enough despite the
fact that I was getting like five hours
of sleep at night I was working so hard
doing YouTube is cool trying to have
like a boyfriend in a social life I
still felt like I was just like falling
short all the time I think the key to
this is not to compare yourself to other
people and like your best is not
necessarily what someone else's best is
all you can do is all you can do give me
the vote find people that you actually
click with that was another thing I feel
like from the movies it just looked like
everyone had like the perfect little
friend group in the college you are
always surrounded by people especially
like looking at Greek life like
sororities and fraternities I'm not in a
sorority but it just always looked like
people like how two ton of friends and I
feel like
I was in college I was like I feel like
I just don't click with very many people
like going into college you're just
surrounded by so many different people
than like you want to high school with
and it'll be hard to find people that
like know you know your story and you
just like kind of hit it off with right
off the bat a sign that just means it
takes time to meet people that you
really actually like actually easier
than you think to eat healthy feel like
you're going to hear a lot that like the
freshman 15 is real you're going to get
away you're going to be stressed and the
dining hall does that make good food
gram it I don't have a meal plan I cook
all my spoons on my own I do my own
grocery shopping so like yeah but I feel
like even if you had a meal plan like
you can choose what to eat and what not
to eat it eating healthier like isn't
that hard you can still get your own
groceries your own snacks if you have
good self-control like eating healthy is
not the hardest thing in the world it
just a might be a little bit more
expensive and be you may have to put a
little bit more time into it working out
is hard in college so I thought that I
would have this great workout plan and I
like I would jog all the time of night
and have my three kids membership and I
just want to college I was like I don't
have time for this my gym I said get on
the subway go to so it's not exactly
like oh let me just like walk to the gym
so it was hard to like get a workout in
and like have to plan it throughout my
day and just know that like working out
might not be as easy as you think it
will be granted if you want it to happen
that you can make it happen I think it's
definitely very much possible just know
you're gonna have to put in a little bit
more effort if you actually want to like
be good at working out number six that
was not six after they're definitely
more interactive than you may think
they're going to be I had this idea that
college is going to be like I could
sneak in the back and like sit in the
back and live like 400 student sized
classroom like no one would ever talk to
me or like ask me questions or call on
me maybe it's just because I go to a
really tiny school but I have to talk a
lot in class and most of my classes are
giving presentations answering questions
raising my hand I have like a
participation grade and like all my
classes I just know if you don't go to a
huge school like you are going to have
to speak up but it's not just going to
be you sitting the back like with your
hoodie on like trying to like hide the
boys are still boys people told me that
like whenever I went to college guys
would be so much more mature and I would
see such a big difference and like all
of you be in class with men not boys
anymore assault guys are still dies just
as girls are probably still girls
everyone is still maturing not everyone
is like an adult once you get to college
one of the guys I met in college we're
still really immature granted I have a
great boyfriend it's very immature he is
an exception so don't expect them all to
be perfect guys yet sometimes you will
just need your family there are so many
times or I just like to meet in my lawn
or need in my dad I can't tell you how I
just like wanted to be like independent
and be an adult and not have to need my
parents but specifically I blogged about
this but I lost my wallet on the subway
I like seven o'clock in the morning and
the MTA people were not helping me and I
was just a mess and guy another one of
those moments or is just like I can be
my dad right now or my mom so just know
you're still going to need your mom and
you're still going to need your dad so
don't cut them off call them be nice to
them they love you and you should still
love them all the much more because
you're probably going to need them even
more in college than you did in high
school you time is really important okay
said earlier there's kind of this idea
that in college you're always around
people you're always doing activities
you're always in class of people but how
many type of yourself is really
important if you like a lot of times in
college you feel like you always have to
be meeting people or being social for
their artists times when you need to sit
and kind of be by yourself think about
your thoughts journal listen to music
watch Netflix whatever it may be your
time is important to recharge if you
don't have that you're gonna go crazy
classes are indeed harder I know people
probably tell you this but a lot of
times people would tell me like Oh
College really actually is an advantage
like high school but guys college is
hard and used to work your tail off if
you want to do well so all I got to say
is make sure you're studying well focus
in class get your stuff together so does
everything that I have to say let me
know down below what something that you
learned in college the people that tell
you I'd love to hear you should also go
watch my last video link right here and
subscribe down below I love you guys and
I'll see you guys later this week my
friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
