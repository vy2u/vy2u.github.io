step to my girl
today I'm here to film a thanks to do
whatever you were born in the summer
video in this video I wanted to be super
authentic and genuine so basically every
time in the past week that I've been
bored I am picks up my camera and taking
you guys along with me on my journeys of
life just so you get really true actual
things that you can do whatever you're
bored if you're new to my channel hello
my name is Michelle and you should
definitely subscribe right now I will
patiently wait while you subscribe this
is getting a little awkward
I believe that's everything that I have
to say for this intro so we're just
gonna go ahead and get into the things
to do so I personally love to go
shopping even if I don't want to buy
anything I'll just look around and see
what the stores have because it's super
fun and it's really fun to do with a
friend or your sister like I did I'll
just go and hang out and try things on
for fun and you don't even have to spend
money if you don't want to
another thing I like to do is go out to
eat because I feel like sometimes we're
just so busy we can't enjoy our food so
when you're bored you can really sit and
relax and enjoy your food and it's yummy
we had pay way here you can also make
some s'mores we actually found these
s'mores marshmallows which are squares
and are pretty awesome so I just made
some s'mores with my family and it was
honestly such a good time to chat and
relax and have some pretty yummy
marshmallow chocolatey goodness
is
another thing I've been loving is going
on walks
I actually went online with Gunnar right
here we found a really pretty kind of
pond area just to kind of chat and walk
around usually I like to do this in the
evening when it's not so hot but today I
was in the heat of the day and it was a
little blazing you can also go on a
super cute little ice-cream date which
is what I did with Gunnar but you can go
with your friends if you don't really
have a significant other or anything but
yeah this is super yummy and mine kind
of melted all over me so it was a little
bit of a mess but it's really okay it
makes it even more fun so another fun
thing to do is to go listen to some live
music I know a lot of cities actually
have these going on where you can go and
listen to them and I actually listen to
some super cool jazz music like this
it was such a fun time to hang out with
some friends and talk and just kind of
enjoy nature and sit outside for a
little bit
I really hope you guys like this video
and maybe got some ideas of things to do
whenever you're bored in the summer you
should definitely go watch my last video
it was about some cool heatless summer
hairstyles that you can do if you're
kind of in the need for some easy
hairstyles for the summer you're not
already subscribed you should definitely
do that right now I believe the button
is down below because I'd love to have
you here in my family and I post every
Sunday Thursday so you know why not I'll
go ahead and see you guys in my next
video I love you guys so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
