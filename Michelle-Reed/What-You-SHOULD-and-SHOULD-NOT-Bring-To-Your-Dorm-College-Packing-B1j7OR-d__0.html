telling you guys what you should and
shouldn't bring to college in terms of
dorm stuff I just did one of these
videos all about clothes and it our say
went really really well with you guys a
lot of you guys seem to like that video
and said you wanted to see this one
so also I'm doing in today's video if
you're new and you just clicked on this
video is Michelle Rhee I go to the Kings
College in New York City I'm going to be
a sophomore and I'm posting at our
College video so you might as well hit
that subscribe button down below and
also obviously some of these things you
may really use in college and if you do
that's totally okay so just like from my
series and my friends I kind of asked
around says the kind of stuff that you
could leave at home but if you use that
totally cool but let's just go ahead and
get right into the video
so starting all sort of things that you
don't necessarily need to bring to
college number one would be extra tea
and light bulbs I have so many tools
that I literally never even touch and
they just took up a whole drawer in my
apartment obviously if you're hanging up
some decorations like have your parents
bring tools you don't need to have a
whole toolbox full what's up cuz you're
probably not going to use it it would be
a ton of mug if you have a huge month
collection maybe just pick your favorite
I mean obviously you drink a ton of
coffee in college I know I did but I've
kind of used this thing like three mugs
over and over again I was fine number
three would be a ton of desk
organization stuff so don't bring a ton
of like paper waves and cute little
things in the office section of Target I
know I wanted to like decorate my desk
all super cute but honestly just got
really cluttered and annoying clutter
it's never cute number four would be a
ton of plates and glasses you don't need
like a huge pack honestly just like a
couple plates a couple glasses and
you're good I ended up using paper
plates a lot more so I didn't have to
wash them I would just recommend not
bringing a ton of placing glasses just a
few that you may need number five would
just be in general a kind of bloom decor
your dorm room is probably really really
small you can't fit all that much stuff
in there so like while you may want to
bring everything that you found and
Target in the dorm section don't bring
it all just bring your favorite pieces
number six would be an abundance of
makeup and toiletries I cannot tell you
how much like make up an extra lotion
and hairspray I brought I just ended up
not using and the thing about New York
is I couldn't like take it all home with
me because I had like two suitcases so I
had to throw away a ton of stuff I try
to give away a lot on Hanah throw away
so many my nice toiletries just because
I could
take it home for me I brought so many
eyeshadow palettes I was like oh my gosh
oh you do not need this many eyeshadow
palettes number seven would be a time of
school supplies I did not use a lot of
school supplies in college I use like
two notebooks a couple folders and
pencils and honestly you can buy those
whenever you actually get to school and
kind of know what your classes requires
I would just recommend waiting on school
supplies and not going crazy beforehand
number eight would be a ton of
knickknacks what I mean by this is just
stuff this sits around like stuff or
maybe your trip when you have to Florida
when you were eight or something like
don't bring memories like that I think
it's good to bring photos and stuff a
couple frames of pictures to remind
yourself of your family and your friends
don't bring like a ton of little
souvenirs because again they just
clutter up their room and clutter just
gets really annoying and it stresses me
out it's probably not stressing you out
to number nine would be a ton of
leisurely reading books and you want
like a ton of your favorite books that
you want to bring maybe just leave them
at home please you're going to be
reading a lot in college you have to
read books that you don't necessarily
want to read so leave a leisurely
reading ones back home maybe just bring
a couple number 10 my last one would be
a sewing kit I never really had to sell
anything I remember one time I had a
hole in my dress and I had a really
sweet friend who literally just sewed it
out for me she was so so kind thank you
how I wouldn't recommend bringing like a
huge kit maybe a tiny one but nothing
too large so now other things that I say
you do need to make sure that you
breathe number one might be really cute
wall decor wall decor is one of those
things that doesn't clutter things up
because it's on a wall how do I wall
filled really made me feel more at home
and cozy in my apartment or if your
walls really ugly bring a tapestry and
it kind of hides everything and it's a
really great way to kind of jazz things
up number two
guys this is the most important thing in
this whole video so make sure you're
listening a mattress topper this does
wonders College mattresses are so not
comfortable guys they are so bad and
they're really really gross so bring a
mattress topper I have found one at Bed
Bath and Beyond it was like a twin XL
and it was memory foam and it was like
$80 I think but so worth it it is a game
changer I'm going to use it all for
years and I love it
number three would be a really cute rug
rugs really jazz things up and it makes
me so much more homey I went the whole
year without having a rug I always felt
so sad I was like I need to get a bra
number four if your school doesn't allow
this
don't bring this book fairy light fairy
lights really make things nice and warm
and cozy especially if it's a late night
of studying and you've just been going
for a while and once I turn on my very
life is so much more calming then and I
love them
number five extra sheets so you don't
have to be washing your sheets all the
time I know so many people who would
wash their sheets once every like two
months washing your sheets more than
that I would wash my sheets like every
week I only had one set so I just had to
keep washing the same set but having a
couple is really nice you don't have to
necessarily always be on top of this
number six would be a full-length mirror
it's really helpful whenever you can
check out your outfit before you head
out and you can also just put this on
your door and so it saves a lot of space
in the dorms number seven would be a fan
I know my roommate Lauren last year
would get so hot in the night I had like
this little extra fan they could clip on
your bed she loved that thing she used
it like every night so definitely
recommend picking up one of those number
eight would be paper plates as opposed
to a ton of glass tops some like you
don't feel like washing a ton of place
and that's totally okay so spring some
paper one so you have this one hand
number nine would be a power strip so
you can plug in multiple things into one
thing but make sure it's like certified
with your school I know there's a
certain like protector that has to be on
it and then also a really long charging
cord so if you do have like a top bunk
you'll have like a long cord to charge
your phone so you can have it in bed
with you and number 10 we just be extra
storage so I've sure been not a ton but
I know I didn't have a space to put like
my socks and underwear and that kind of
stuff so having like an extra storage
you know it's really nice those are all
the things I would say you need and you
don't need in terms of dorm stuff let me
know down below what's one thing you
wish you didn't bring to college and
what's one thing that you do wish you
both to college we can help each other
out in this video also make sure to go
on to my last video it links right here
I love you guys so much I'll see you
guys my next one bye friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
