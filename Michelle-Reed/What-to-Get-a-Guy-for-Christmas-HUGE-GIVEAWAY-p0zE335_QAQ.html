he's going to rate them one out of five
five be hey I would really like to get

of get a perspective not to say that
Gunnar's like all guys though because
I'm sure some of these things guys would
like the Thunder doesn't like and vice
versa so don't necessarily take this
video like too seriously but it's just
thinking of you guys an idea of what

know also I want to say I'm doing such a
fun giveaway it's so big and huge and

I'm really really excited because
everyone in this giveaway is really cool
and awesome it is Christmas and with all
that being said we're just gonna go
ahead and get into the video so
basically all of these gifts range at
different prices so I'm just gonna put
the picture somewhere and then how much
money it cost the first thing is the
Hamilton Beach breakfast sandwich maker
but also like if you were dad at the
soup if I was a dad this would be 5 out
of 5
boyfriend
probably two or three but it's not very
like practical for like high school dads
but for if I was a dad we do we'd be
booming this next thing is an app Co
tech water resistant wireless bluetooth
speaker with suction cups so I think you
put this in your shower it's like a
shower speaker four or five four or five
yeah I think it's a good boyfriend is
possible with any Bluetooth so you can
wear your phone out yeah this next one
is cheaper so this is like a good
stocking stuffer things but it's
electronics cleaning putty so like you
use it to clean your keyboard and I like
picks up like dust so if you're a guy
that's more particular about your
gadgets I feel like this would be better
pretty cool yeah I'd say if you're in
the electronics keyboards and stuff then
computer gaming and computers and stuff
probably say for if you're not in that
computer descendants yeah one this next
one is a little more expensive so it'd
be definitely more for like boyfriend
that you've been dating for a while or
like a fiance or a husband it's learning
how to fly like you go with a pilot and
you learn how to fly a plane on my phone
it says it's 120 and up I feel like it's
about that problem where's her lesson
it's like you're married you know yeah
this would be this would be I'd say five
out of five five on 5 we're now flying
pretty cool this next one is kind of
funny but it is a hand reflexology
massage shirt so like you put your hand
in it and massages your hand so for like
someone who works a lot using their
hands
I feel like that'd be really good one or
two one or two after I get done like
playing video games or something I don't
want to put my hand in a massager to
detox after a session this is actually
something that I got Gunnar a while back
but it's one of those cologne sets that
basically it's a four you can see a ton
of samples and then once you find one
you like you can take it into the store
and get a full-size which i think is
really cool I was
thinking of this like whenever you were
like whenever you said you've got from a
mic I'm gonna say one yeah tell us me
just like messed up there this gift is
very cool I'd say probably four or five
on it to this one was something that I
think I saw on like a college kids guy
but it said like over the ear headphones
that like block out noise like really
nice ones I probably say three yeah
three create a three to four ring
because they would be very nice okay so
it's basically like a super mini fridge
that you can set right by your bed and
I'm when I was looking at it said like
so while you were on your laptop or
something you don't want to get up and
get a drink just reach over the mini
fridge I bought was cheaper than this
one this is 150 and didn't recover a
doll for that probably a three because
it made it be nice and convenient but
then if you forget to stock it like the
four drinks that you would have in there
you're kind of out of luck and you have
to go into the kitchen good point
this next thing is a pair of sunglasses
and I saw these in there like wooden
sunglasses I think they're called a
Bonnie and Clyde sunglasses I just
thought they looked really cool new
difference and then for a while we're
looking at one crimson really yeah
they're cool a protist a four or five or
by I really like the way that my
grandson glasses look maybe not this
particular yeah what green sunglasses
they're cool this is something that
actually I think my mom got you last
year but it's called a slate mobile air
desk so it's basically a laptop desk and
it has something like a spot for your
phone it has a spot for you to write and
all that stuff and I know it looks
pretty cool being in college and stuff
this is coming like really like Andy
probably four or five you're very in
this community it's called a sticker
tracker I think it's basically it tracks
where your keys are so you link it to
your phone and so when you lose your
keys you can find them and like you can
use your phone
just in general this is a four yeah gift
from
girlfriend probably a three could you
like if it was me I put it with like a
lot of different things I wouldn't just
like buying that's truck reverse
sentimental am i doing notice hey you
really forgetful here's something I've
been making not sure this one is more of
a dad gift I feel like but it's a
smartphone projector so you put your
phone in it and it like projects your
pictures and your videos on a wall five
five five what you're ever watching
Netflix in your room and like see your
laptop is dead
you left your charger somewhere you
don't want to get it just put your phone
in that and it projects it on the wall
and now you're watching that puts on the
big screen I don't even think about that
so this is something I found on Etsy but
it was an iPhone 6 personalized docking
station for like your tech stuff kind of
similar to the laptop desk but more so
for your desk so you could put like your
watch on it your phone probably a three
on this one the key thing is useful but
the one that I feel like yeah they're
three this is actually something that I
got as a gift and sitting over there but
they're these swell water bottles that
you put all like your water or your
coffee in and it keeps it cold for 24
hours or it keeps it warm for 12 hours
probably at five yeah 5 I mean it
depends on what you're into really even
if you like sit around a lot at home
like you just put like Dr Pepper or
water in there it's going to stay cold
for a while also check out hydrofloss
they're all they're really cool the
small ones are cool though hey this next
thing is something I think is good to
give to like your brother or something
but they have really nice shaving kits
out there only four four four gotta tell
they're pretty cool if someone has a lot
of watches you could give this a watch
box or you could get them a watch if
they don't have very many watches and
watch boxes it's probably four to five
because yeah I have a lot of watches and
the watch box I got watch you
Christmas just store nicely in this next
one I think is cute it's not as like
particular anything but they got someone
a wallet and then they stuffed it with
like gift cards if they thought they use
so like food or money or something and I
thought I was cute that's a 10
that's a 10 really positive cards are
amazing college students were broke and
gift cards two places are like a
treasure trove or just money yeah they
have a thing called Birchbox for women
and a heist like perfumes and makeup and
stuff like that but they actually just
came out with one for men so I don't
know exactly what's in it but I feel
like it's like maybe skin care products
cologne but can you get it monthly and
it has like little doodads feel no to
know that's pretty cool it's pretty neat
you probably say like a four on this
like because it's a gift that keeps on
giving
true and even I do you know what you get
or now you don't know it's a surprise
it's something better
yeah I'd probably say afford that's it
to me in this last thing is the thing
that I'm getting Gunnar casinos but a
nice pair of shoes if you know their
shoe size I think everyone I think
everyone could use a nice pair of shoes
basically gonna has a specific parry one
so he knows getting in those but it's
okay
he better it in five it's a funny game I
feel like with expensive shoes you don't
really want to spin of it or not ease
yourself yeah so those are all the gifts
that I have I'll have everything linked
down below so you can go to the links
directly and see what I'm talking about
but I hope this gave you guys a good
idea of you know what maybe you could
look to get for the guy that you have in
your life whether it be your brother or
your boyfriend or your dad or whatever
you guys should go watch my last video
it was a winter morning routine and I
had a ton of fun filming it and I think
it turned out pretty well
Gunnar help me film it it was nice yeah
so I will see you guys my next video bye
