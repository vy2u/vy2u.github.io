would create cannot last in ivory the
blue shapes this familiar watches the
night melts away
we got hi guys you're about to watch a
guy girl look folks so basically I
combined some guy outfits and some girl
outfits and put them into a lookbook the
output side I showed are a little bit of
a mix between fall and winter so I kind
of just put them together and I did what
to wear for fall and winter
so if the alphas are too warm or too
cold for your climate you can definitely
change them and just kind of get some
inspiration from them also I dyed my
hair a lighter I did balayage but I did
it focus on the front and the ends of my
hair so you actually can't really see it
but um yeah it's definitely a lot
lighter it's more blonde and I really
like it so if you're wondering Michelle
your hair looks a little bit lighter
this video it is because I went a little
blonder though about my being sad we're
just gonna go ahead and get into the
video so my first outfit is definitely
more of a winter outfit or at least I
would call this a winter outfit I'm
wearing this romper from Urban
Outfitters which is so pretty I love the
material in the texture of it I also
paired it with a vest from H&amp;amp;M and then
this long necklace which is from altered
state I think that you just really go
together and it really helps accent the
romper and for tights I am just wearing
some maroon tights which I believe are
from Target and then also these booties
which are from choies I love booties and
I think these ones went perfectly with
the outfit so yeah this is definitely
one of my favorite outfits I think that
is so so cute on the day I filmed this
lookbook actually went on a little road
trip
and brought along my tiny tea which is a
detox and a tea which helps with
bloating that I absolutely love it's so
nice in the fall time because I love
drinking tea especially this one after I
eat I actually mentioned this in a video
a while back but I forgot to tell you
guys an awesome coupon code which is
happy 5 it's actually gets you five
dollars off of the tiny tea and it also
gets you two boxes of the 28-day tiny
tea talks and healthy living ebooks at
35 percent off which is such a good deal
so I just had to come back and tell you
guys that and especially that I'm still
loving this tea
so this is Gunners more casual outfit he
definitely has a very casual style but
basically his whole entire outfit is
from PacSun because we always shop there
and it's probably one of his favorite
stores so he has a nice denim
button-down with a graphic tee
underneath and then some straight jeans
and he's wearing some Clark shoes which
I think go great with the outfit and of
course his favorite ray-ban sunglasses
which he loves so much so that's pretty
much it for his little fall casual
outfit my next outfit is something that
I would wear on an everyday basis I have
this chunky maroon sweater which is from
brandy melville and I really like
especially love the color this burgundy
color is so nice for the fall time and
then my hat it's actually from my
sister's closet but it is originally
from Urban Outfitters these hats are so
cute like this video if you were so into
these hats right now because they're so
trendy and so cute and then I'm also
wearing my favorite Franko Sarco boots
to just finish off the outfit and then
Gunners last outfit is slightly more
dressy I actually love this shirt of his
it's definitely one of my favorite
shirts that he wears but it's from
Robert Graham it's just a nice buttoned
down kind of flannel shirt but it's
nicer than a flannel I don't really know
how to describe it and then he just has
on the same jeans from earlier from
PacSun and some Clarke shoes and again
his Ravens and I just really really
liked this outfit I think it's casual
yet like great for a date or you know
hanging out with some friends and all
that good stuff
so I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video I had such a fun time filming this
the scenery was absolutely beautiful and
so breathtaking and it was just a really
really fun time if you're interested in
some more of my videos you should
definitely watch my last one it was the
perfect day and I basically compared at
day piecing social media and a day of
not using social media or my phone and
so you should check that one out I put a
lot of time into that and I really liked
how it came out and I also appreciate
all the positive feedback that I've
gotten on that video you guys are
awesome and I'll see you guys in my next
video bye friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
