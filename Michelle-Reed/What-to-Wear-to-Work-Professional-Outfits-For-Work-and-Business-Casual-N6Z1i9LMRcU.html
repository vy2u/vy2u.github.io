today's video I'm super stoked for
because it's going to be if this is
casual business professional lookbook
now if you clicked on this video you
might be starting a job you might having
a job interview or something and you
might just want to learn how to dress in
a way that is professional but also
stylish in your style at the same time
actually go to the Kings College in New
York City and I get to dress business
casual everyday which I know for bus any
college kids are probably like what the
heck that is crazy I'm the kind of
person where if I dress well and I'm
feeling my outfit I just have a better
day I work better I feel more productive
and so it has been the best thing for me
plus once I get a job I'm already gonna
have a whole wardrobe of clothes to wear
so I think it's great
quite frankly I just don't want to wear
leggings to class that does not appeal
to me also this video i'm featuring
artemis shoes which this is not
sponsored by this brand company just
asked me if I wanted to check out a pair
of their shoes and I loved them and
actually got to visit their offices in
Boston it was just so much fun they're
not paying me to say this I just think
the shoes are really cute they have
these awesome handmade loafers are a bit
pricey but they're like handmade in
Turkey and they're just also so cute I'm
gonna have this free link down below I
featured I've been one I outfits and I
definitely recommend checking those out
if you ever have to dress professional I
would love to see your outfit so
definitely make sure to tag me because
I'm always looking for some inspiration
and that's everything I have to say so
I'll just go ahead and roll the lookbook
so for this first outfit this could
definitely pass as business
professionals so it's a little bit nicer
than business casual but my top is so
cute I love it because it ties at the
waist and it just kind of accentuates
your waist and makes you look very very
good it's very flattering this one is
from Nordstrom Rack and then I'm just
writing these culotte pants which I love
for business because they're comfortable
but there's still more formal and then
my shoes are just these Sam Edelman tie
up heels which are really cute but
they're also coming about uncomfortable
or not that comfortable so I'll have
everything linked down below though if
you want to check out from this outfit
my second outfit is a little bit more
color
and fun my dress is from boohoo I love
it I think it's so cute in the purple
shade it's just something different I
don't wear all the time and then I just
have on these slides which I also love
for business things because they look
professional but they're really
comfortable and those ones are from TJ
Maxx and again I love how this dress
ties at the waist cuz it's just really
flattering it's so fun and professional
and it's really cute this next outfit I
would say it's definitely the most
business casual I'm just wearing this
black top which I got from Express
Express has really good basic pieces if
you need professional outfits and then
my pants are from Topshop
I love these as well I think the color
is really pretty and then I have on my
Artemis loafers I love these I think
they're so cute the colors are beautiful
and perfect for fall they're just
literally my favorite loafers and I
think they really kind of tie this
outfit together and give it a little bit
of a pop of color and so I definitely am
into it and then this last outfit is
probably the most formal but I love this
dress guys is from Zara and I think the
puffy shoulders are just so girly and
fun and they really really add a lot to
the outfit and then my heels are just
these velvet style heels which I got
from DSW and yeah the self it is
definitely little bit more formal with
the heels but if you have a more
professional event I think that it's
really cute in classy but still early so
I hope you guys enjoyed watching this
video and I hope you've got a couple
tips on how you can be more professional
if you do have to dress a certain way
for the workplace it's great and it
honestly teaches you so much about being
a professional individual and I love it
you should also go watch my last video
it leaked right here and let me know
what you'd like to see next down below I
love you guys and I'll see you guys my
next video bye friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
