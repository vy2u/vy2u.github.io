the past and I just think they're cool
videos to watch I don't know they're
just something that is interesting to
watch I don't know why yeah I wanted to
wait til I got through the school year
to do this so I didn't just put random
things in my bag I'm like oh this isn't
my backpack but it's not really you know
I want it to be like legit this is
what's in my backpack I haven't really
like sat down on the video what seems to
be almost a month even though that's a
lie if things like two weeks ago but
still I just wanted to sit down and
chill and film a video and talk to you
guys so that's what I'm doing so this is
my backpack I know it's not the cutest
it's just this gray North Face backpack
I know it's not like you or anything
when it comes to school I don't care
about cute I honestly just care about
you know getting all my stuff to school
making good grades and going home yep
this is my backpack guys this is my
second year using this backpack and it's
really great it's durable it fits
everything and as far as I'm concerned
he gets the job done so that's all that
matters so in this front pocket right in
the I don't know if you can see it cuz I
know a little front pocket right there I
have my wallet it's just a fossil wallet
looks like that
and I just bring this because sometimes
I like to buy food at school usually I
pack my lunch but you know they like
cookies and stuff so cookies are great
so yeah I also have my phone in here I
saw the iPhone 4 it's the white one and
I have a cheetah phone case I don't know
where it's from but that's my phone
and then I also have so much other stuff
in here like I have deodorant I don't
know why I have socratis cuz I get
storms around sometimes I have
flashcards because I'm a nerd I have a
texting kills ring because texting kills
as have another pack of flashcards at
the bottom because like I said before I
have a nerd
then there's like these little pockets
on the side which are meant for water
bottles but I keep flashcards in there
because it's hyper nerd I am what really
is embarrassing I'm sorry so I carry
around a binder separately with me and
it just looks like this it's just pink
it's pretty basic it's falling apart I
need to get anyone but my algebra
notebook because in the algebra 2 right
now and then I have my algebra folder
and then I have my chemistry notebook
and then my chemistry folder I try to
like match my phone or my notebooks but
obviously you know sometimes it just
doesn't really work so I also have a
crumpled-up PSAT guide because I thought
that I couldn't even look through it so
it's not for the big pocket on the
inside I keep my other like class stuff
I have my brother's treat folder because
I'm an AP World History right now and
then I also have my also have my history
notebook as well these ones match pretty
well so I did good on that one I have to
have my English folder because I'm in
English too right now also I did say I'm
a sophomore in high school if you're
wondering so yeah that's great 10 I also
have my English Composition book right
here you can make the right stuff I also
have my French composition book right
here as well because that's the language
and I chose to take and then I have my
planner which I haven't really used
because we've gotten really good about
what I meant bring what I have to do but
towards the beginning of the year I use
this like every day but now I kind of
just don't use it because I can remember
what I have to do I don't forget stuff
easily so that's honestly it just takes
too much time to write down on my
homework when I can just remember it I
also have the Lord of the Flies because
that's the book that we have to read but
we just finished it
and then I have my pencil pouch which is
actually a makeup bag from forever 21
I've had this for like three years now I
think but it's kind of gross actually
but it just has pencils and stuff that
you find and that's everything this in
my backpack I know I don't carry like
makeup or hair accessories yourself I
just honestly I don't touch up my makeup
at school on there don't work and do my
stuff do not put on makeup so I do have
chapstick somewhere in the depths of
this but I really don't know where it's
at right now so that's everything that's
in my backpack
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
leave and your requests you have down
below also I'm kind of interested to
know a great Yurman to leave that down
below just for my own reference I guess
but yep
