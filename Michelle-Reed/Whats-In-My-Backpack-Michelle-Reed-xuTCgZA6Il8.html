be showing you guys what is in my
backpack now I will warn you I'm going
to be a senior next year and I only have
four classes and so I don't have a ton
of stuff in my backpack and I'm pretty
minimal to stick with my backpack anyway
so this probably won't be the longest
video but since I'm not doing a school
supply haul I figured I would just show
you guys what's in my backpack and what
supplies I'm using this year if you're
new to my channel you should definitely
subscribe I upload every Sunday and
Thursday you can hit the button here or
down below and you should also like this
video if you have started school by the
time you're watching this video and
let's just go ahead and see what I keep
in my backpacks so this is the bag that
I decided to use this year it is a
really pretty like mossy green color
it's with JanSport and it has a suede
bottom and I really like this backpack
it's the perfect size for me and I
really like the color I've never had a
backpack this color before so there's
this small pocket right here in the
front that we're going to start off with
first I just have my phone in here this
is what it looks like my case is from
Best Buy if you're wondering also keep
my ball in here which also has my keys
on it because you never know when you're
gonna have to purchase something at
school and this also has a license in it
so I kind of need to have it also keep
my headphones in here because I like to
listen to music in the hallways or when
I'm working on projects and I need a
focus or something so these are
definitely very central to have I keep
two hair ties because sometimes I'm just
not feeling like wearing my hair down
I'm having a bad day so I just want to
throw it up so I always keep these in
here I usually end up losing them but
I'm set for the first week school I also
keep some gum because I am a coffee
addict and I really don't like having
coffee breath at school because no one
wants to be that person guys I always
keep gum in here this is the extra polar
ice now my favorite kind of gone but you
know it works it's good there is then
another small pocket right here it's
just a little bit bigger than the other
one and the first thing I have is my
planner this
the planner that I'm using this year it
is a 2016 1 from rifle Paper Company and
I really like this it has really
inspirational quotes on each week really
good for me personally and I really like
this so how about a link down below if
you want to check it out I'm not
sponsored or anything I just really like
this agenda and I'm excited to use it
then we have my pencil case which is
actually a makeup bag and this is a
little too big for me but I didn't want
to buy a pencil case so in here we have
a pencil sharpener because sometimes you
need to use an actual pencil
non-mechanical wand I have some sharpie
highlighters if I need to highlight
something these mechanical pencils which
are just the Paper Mate ones I know
everyone kind of uses these I like these
they're awesome then we have some pens I
actually hate writing in pen but
sometimes we have to and so I just have
these in case I need them and then I
also have these really cute little
almost like marker pens I don't really
know how to describe them but they make
your notes look really cute and I always
saw people using these last years I was
like this year I'm gonna pick some up
and they're really pretty colors so I
like these I have a couple sharpies
these are both like the regular ones and
then the fine tip ones
I'll talk scissors because I feel like
in high school no one ever has scissors
or colored pencils and so I'm gonna be
the kid with the scissors I also keep my
glasses in here because I cannot see the
board whenever I'm sitting down and I
really need contacts but for now I just
have these they're just the standard
black ones everyone kind of has and I
actually lost the case for these and so
I really need to find one because they
are gonna break if I don't but I also
keep index cards because I use these a
ton and I haven't used this pack yet I
just figured I'd show you guys they
would usually be in that pocket with my
plants and then there is the big pocket
right here which I actually keep all of
my school stuff in like my school
suppose like I said I'm only taking four
classes and so I don't need a lot of
stuff I guess I'll tell you guys what
classes I'm taking I'm doing ap
government economics AP statistics AP
English 4 and then aquatic science and
I'm also on drill team but
really counting clocks for me um but
yeah so I don't need a whole lot of
stuff I have a composition but I'm not
sure if I will need this or not I feel
like English I may need a composition
book I didn't buy anything else for
English just because I never really know
what I'm gonna need for that class but I
just picked this up in case and then
have a three subject notebook right here
this is the office Depot brand usually I
get the five star lines but they were
all sold out and I found like how these
look they have like shiny covers so I
got this and then I also got a folder to
match I think I will use this for
government or economics I then have the
same folder in the same notebook as the
last ones I don't know what I'm gonna
use this for probably for sistex I don't
know but just a folder in a notebook and
then lastly I have this really pretty
teal color I tried to match the folder
didn't really work but this one I'll
probably use for aquatic science because
I feel like science classes just have to
be like green you know I just matches
and they're the same so I also have some
college-ruled paper this is just like
the loose leaf paper and I don't really
know where I can put this yet because I
don't have like a binder or anything but
you always see paper and I always run
out so I always have a book in here this
is 1984 I am still reading this book
I've been reading it for awhile I just
haven't had time like with working on
YouTube and all that stuff so I'm hoping
at school I'll have some free time to
read so I really like reading so I like
to keep this in here in case I have a
spare moment is everything that I keep
in my backpack so I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video let me know what your
number one backpack essential is down
below and I would definitely check those
out and see if I missed anything if you
want to watch a more rambling video of
mine to get a break from back to school
I just post in line about social media
and comparison and some of the struggles
that I was going through a while back so
you should definitely check out that
video if you're into that kind of stuff
and I'll see you guys my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
