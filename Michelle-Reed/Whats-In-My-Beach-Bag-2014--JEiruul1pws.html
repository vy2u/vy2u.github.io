boy 2 to save you from your own ways you
play forgiveness and watching now
hey guys i'm actually outside today as
you can probably tell just because i'm
gonna be filming a what's in my beach
bag video and I decided that I'd be
pretty festive to you know go outside
and do this I know the lighting isn't
the best and it's kind of shady but I
really don't care because it feels great
outside and I really wanted to film this
video my beach bag looks like this and
it's from billabong well to the brand
billabong but it's actually from pacsun
but it's really pretty and just kind of
tribal and I really like it it's huge
and i love it and also as you can tell i
have a pool so this is a really Beach is
kind of cool because I don't live
anywhere near beach so without further
ado let's just go ahead and get start so
ideally I'd first have a towel but I
didn't actually put it in your occasion
late I'll mike share and i don't
actually put it in my bag but i would
usually have a towel and i don't have
like a specific cute when I just kind of
use whatever we have second thing is
cover-ups and I have to that I like to
use the first one is an actual beach
cover-up and it's from Victoria's Secret
it's just white and lace and I really
like this one it's kind of like a dress
it's more by nice cover up when i'm
actually going somewhere but whenever
I'm just staying around my house I like
to use just a big oversized button up
and this was from eddie bauer and i
really like it it's just really loose
and it's not too heavy so i'm not going
to sweat in it but it's still long
enough to where it kind of covers up my
swimsuit and stuff the next thing that I
have is books because I don't like to go
on my phone whenever I'm tanning I try
to read books and so I have three here
that I really like this first one is the
confessions of a shopaholic I read this
whole series and it's such a fun series
and i definitely recommend it if you
want something that's just not hard to
read i also have winning balance which
is shawn Johnson's kind of like
autobiography really liked it and so I
definitely recommend this one too it's
kind of cool to see her story or
whatever then lastly I have this one
which is the Teen Vogue handbook and it
just kind of has like pictures and stuff
about fashion its kind of more of just a
fun read that I like to look at
different like careers in fashions just
really fun to read and it's really cool
to look at all the pictures next thing I
have is a snack in water because water
is definitely essential because where I
live it is so hot like right now I'm
actually sweating
and so water is essential because you
don't want to get all thirsty you want
to keep hydrated and not get too thirsty
next thing is I have to eat a snack
because I love snacks and so I just have
goldfish which is my favorite kind of
snack thing I also like peanut butter
pretzels but goldfish still wins next I
have my deep tanning oil in SPF four and
I really like this stuff because it
helps me tan and it really makes you a
lot tanner I don't really know exactly
what it does but it really really works
ideally I'd also have some sunscreen but
I've actually ran out and so I've kind
of just been using this which is bad but
I would also have put on sunscreen
before I go to the pool because you
don't want to get burnt and have skin
issues what not i also have deodorant
because I sweat and you sweat everyone
sweats and so you want to make sure you
have deodorant cuz I feel like that's
something that's really really important
these are my two favorite guns that I
also have I have the orbit bubble mint
which is kind of like a bubbly misty
dumb obviously and then I have the
eclipse gum which is more of a minty and
i love these huge jars because they hold
so much gum and i feel like i never run
out with you and then there's like a
little pocket right here as you can see
and I keep all of my smaller things in
here I've two pairs of sunglasses
depending on what I want the first one
is just a golden pair of aviators and
these are my favorite ones that look
like this I really like these sunglasses
they're kind of more my simple plain
ones i also have these bigger kind of
2001 and this is one of the sun is
really just coming down because these
are some pretty big glasses as you can
tell they're kind of huge and i love
them and they're kind of my more sassy
sunglasses that's on my phone and a lot
of people asked where my cases from this
is from kate spade but i actually got it
from nordstrom rack said i have this
little pouch thing from beer bradley and
I keep all of my lip and hair essentials
I hate getting my lips burnt and so I
have the baby lips dr. rescue one which
has it has SPF something it's just a
really pretty raspberry color I'm
wearing it right now if you're wondering
i also have my bluestacks moisture melt
with SPF 15 and this is more of like a
liquid chapstick and its really really
hydrating to your lip
and I love this one as well as tough a
couple hair ties because I like to put
my hair up whenever I go to the pool
just because it gets all in my face as
you can see and I really don't like what
my hair is just like all up in my face
so I have to put it up basically all the
time I think that's everything that is
in my cool bag I hope this wasn't too
short of a video but I thought it'd be a
fun little video to film so let me know
what you guys did summer essentials and
beach essentials and just like bag
essentials all essentials are for the
summer and yeah i'll see you guys my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
