because it is going to be and what is in
my college backpack video you're
interested I'm a sophomore in college
and I go to school in New York City and
so this is the back that I use this is
what I pack it's a little bit different
than the average college student just
because I go to like a very different
school but I still hope that this helps
you guys out I'm also gonna be posting a
dorm tour soon so if you're interested
in seeing that make sure to give this
video a thumbs up and also let me know
down below I also don't like to carry a
ton of stuff because I just find I'm
commuting and my bag is really heavy it
just kind of takes a toll on me and so
this video is not gonna be super long I
mean I down below what your backpack
essential is for college because I would
definitely be interested so let's just
go ahead and get right into it
so this is the backpack that I use this
is from the brand Madeline and company
it's this really nice like faux leather
gray bag and it has gold detailing and
then it has little sides for your 3's
for compartments in it and so it has so
much storage space so if you are a
college student this is the perfect
backpack I love it just cuz it has so
many separate spots because I have so
many different things in here it
actually sent me this bag but they
didn't tell me they like put it in the
video she just asked if I wanted to try
it out and I really really liked it so I
decided that I was actually gonna use it
for college if you want to check it out
it'll be linked down below and i also
believe i have a coupon code and so i
will put that right here if you're
interested in using that also on the
back it says be happy which is just a
nicer Vidor what I like very angry on
the subway because it's going really
slow so I'm gonna start off with this
front little space right here when you
open it up I just have kind of like
random knick knacks stuff in here also
the inside of this bag it's like gray
stripes gray and white and I just think
it's cute I just have a calculator in
here because I am taking an accounting
class and so that is needed I have my
wallets because obviously gotta have
that has all my IDs and stuff in it fun
fact I actually lost my walk on the
subway one so now I always carry one
that's big such a bad time if you watch
along you know that I have this lip
medics blistex this is just like a
chapstick because my lips get so chapped
I also have my glasses in here because I
can't see the board without these I'll
people don't know but I do have classes
I just don't wear them all the time
because they're not like the mostly cute
thing this ever new glasses these are
prescription these aren't gonna like
look cool
I actually don't worry about as much as
I should I also have the hand food by
soap &amp;amp; Glory this is my favorite hand
lotion and also so glorious just such a
fun company and summer is also take well
because you might be able to tell I'm
currently overcoming a cold and it's not
fun at all and then I just have my
apartment keys because I need these get
into my apartment and then lastly the
most important thing are headphones
because I love commuting to music oh how
my Spotify down below if you want to
check it out it's that this is my lane
shell I've listened to really like chill
music and then there was a second
compartment that it's a little bit
bigger and in here all I have is my
planner I always try to use planners and
I end up not using them and so this year
yet again I'm gonna try to do it I just
find I'm pretty good at remembering
things and so I find I don't really use
these but this one is from Kate Spade it
is just like a medium sized it's not too
big I'm not like crazy about planner
there anything I'll color code anything
just like don't want time for that and I
don't understand how people that would
take me like 20 minutes just to write
things down and I'd rather be like doing
my homework than lose like writing
things down there's also a little
compartment at the top that is smaller
and I just keep my phone in there then I
just have my metro card in my phone it
fits my phone perfectly it's like made
for that and I just think it's really
nice so then you open the huge pocket
and this is where I have my actual
school stuff and for school basically
all I do is I have a 5 star notebook and
then a folder and this works for me in
college I don't take notes on my laptop
just because it doesn't help me and I
find if I actually write things down
even if like the lecture is going really
quickly that I will just remember it a
lot better and then I have a folder just
for like syllabus isn't supper syllabi
and then sometimes my classes will have
like these extra readers to accompany
your actual notes and so I also have
those and he I just had one class today
so I just have this stuff but usually I
would have more and then in the backpack
there's also a laptop case which
really nice even I don't take notes on
my laptop I always like to go to the
library and like do YouTube stuff and
work on my own business and so I take
this this is the 15-inch MacBook this is
the new one this is my new baby I just
got this and it is just so so beautiful
it's so nice having like an actual
compartment to put your stuff makes like
this so that is everything in the actual
backpack and then on the side there are
two cupholders and I actually do like to
bring water with me to class this is
just like the Starbucks tumbler cup I'm
trying to drink more water because I
find in college if I don't drink a ton
of water my skin gets really really bad
and then on the other side I have
another cup cooler in here
I just keep pens and pencils because I
find it's really easy to just like pull
them out of the cupholders instead of
like going in the zipper and like
disrupting class or whatever and so
there's I've got a few pens and pencils
in here also have packed tissues because
I tend to get sporadic nosebleed so that
is everything in my backpack I know this
was not a long video but you guys
requested it and so if you enjoyed it
let me know also let me know what other
college videos you would like to see
because I would love to know you can
also watch my last video links right
here if you want to keep watching them I
love you guys so so much and I look
forward to seeing you guys and only
yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
