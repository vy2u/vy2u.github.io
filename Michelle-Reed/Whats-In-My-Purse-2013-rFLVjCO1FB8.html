what's in my first video because
recently I have got a new purse and
looks like this it's like a mustard
yellow color and it is from fossil and
it used to be my sister Lindsay's but
you got a new purse
so I just took this will color and I
really like it I know it's not like
everybody's style it's pretty big and
bulky and just huge but I don't know I
really like it it's blue in the back by
the way because it kind of rubbed off
for my jeans so so there's two ways you
can carry this you can either carry it
as like a crossbody with the strap like
this or you can carry it like an actual
purchase like I like cooking your arm or
whatever there's two little zip pockets
in the front and in the first one have a
few like pens and pencils I just have
this big one and then a couple pens and
then a lime-green hair type is not just
everything right and then I just have my
Revlon Photoready powder and a powder
brush and of my piece love in Juicy
Couture little rollerball which I'm
pretty sure is empty
yeah and then there's like the bottom
pockets and in here all I have is my
phone I have the iPhone 4 it's wiped and
my case is from Etsy if you're wondering
that's just cheetah print so then there
is the main pocket right here and when
you open it up oh struggle some stuff
inside and there's little pockets and
the first one just has my baby lips this
is the grapevine one it's just a nice
purpley color
we're in it today and I really like it
and then um there's my Bible because I
went to church earlier so I have this I
have my wallet which is also from fossil
it looks like this I don't really
remember what the style is room whatever
but just have my ID here and then I have
some few cards and whatnot no I'm not
going to say what
and then in the main pocket arts have
cash and other stuff that you find in
the wallet and then I have flashlight
blinding of skin not mind you but I
honestly don't really know I sit here
but might need a flashlight sometime so
ever oh and I didn't like add random
stuff in here too this is seriously like
what's in here
I just don't put like Cheetos my bad I
mean I go look you some Cheetos I have
didn't do that so then there's a little
zip pocket right here and I think I have
the most stuff in here I buy sunglasses
which are in it from a bag and they look
like this they're just ombre kind of
sunglasses easy and I'm gonna put it on
I like these I have no idea where
they're from but I like it because
they're kind of all British and then I
just have some fine rain thick green gum
it's just the green one it's the green
one it's my favorite gum and I like gum
that makes my breath smell good not like
a fruity gum if you know what I'm saying
and then I just had a fresh picked
strawberries dermetix I was from Bath
Body Works
because got degree intially and I really
like the way that this smells really
sweet and it's really great for summer
and that is everything it's in my purse
this was probably in extremely short
video and I just want to apologize but I
don't really keep all that much in here
so yeah that's the end of this video and
like always if you have any recommended
videos that you want me to do leave them
down in the comments I'll see you guys
