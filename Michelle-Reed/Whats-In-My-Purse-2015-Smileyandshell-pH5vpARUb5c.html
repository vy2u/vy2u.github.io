purse video because I haven't done one
of these since a really long time I
wasn't kidding so I decided that I would
sit down today and procrastinate doing
my homework and show you guys a little
bit of what I keep in this bad boy if
you're not subscribed to my channel
hello my name is Michelle and I'd love
to have you here watching my videos
regularly so you should definitely
subscribe if you're not already I never
know where the subscribe button side
let's just say it's here today baby oh
and let's just hop on into what is a map
hurts
so my first is a crossbody bag from made
well I love made welts on my favorite
stories even though it's kind of
expensive this purse is so nice it's
such good quality it matches with
everything it's the perfect size for me
I love that it's kind of like a little
box I believe this is around a hundred
and fifty dollars or something like that
but it's definitely worth the price and
for me that's kind of expensive for a
purse because usually it's really large
but this one's well worth it I know it's
gonna last a long time so there's a back
pocket right here and in here and just
keep my phone just because it's the most
accessible pocket and of course I got
Apple so I have the iPhone 6 if you're
wondering in my case is from case-mate I
bought it from Best Buy we also have a
receipt in here this is actually from
the purse that I bought my mom's were
made well for Mother's Day so yeah
there's also a metro card for whenever I
was in here City and I want to go back
then you just open these flops and
there's a good amount of space for all
the other stuff that you have to carry I
have my wallet which matches pretty well
my purse not exactly when it's close to
no Sun fossil is actually a wristlet I
like this cuz sometimes I don't want to
like a whole purse somewhere so you're
just taking bullets in here yourself
wallet stuff and also my super cute
little business cards and these actually
come in handy quite often because my
channel name is a little bit weird and
whenever I tell people really again so
this just kind of makes it easier so
they can have something to actually see
what my channel name is and I was
actually filming my Starbucks video
which I actually just uploaded a couple
days ago on the lady asked what I was
doing and I was like oh you know you
guys my youtube channel cards so you can
totally see the video when it's up so I
would definitely recommend getting
business cards if you have like a pretty
good audience on YouTube and you want to
share your channel also have my
sunglasses which these are from H&amp;amp;M I
bought them when I was in New York and I
really like them they were like nine
dollars and they're super fun and some
are you so I love them I then have this
little bag which has an M on it which is
my little sister
my dance team gave me the first thing in
here is my set bird which is basically a
subscription service where they send you
a new perfume every month and it's like
a deluxe sample travel size basically
just like pop it up and it comes right
here so this one is people and siog a
paris perfume I believe that's what it
sounds like but it's kind of just like
an everyday perfume smells real nice
like its everyday but you can put it on
at night and still be acceptable if you
don't I really like some bird because
instead of buying like a new perfume
every month because believe me I love
buying perfumes and I don't want to buy
a whole bottle every month you can just
buy like a sample size for a fraction of
the price and it's super convenient and
super good for your budget
like I said earlier it's only $15 a
month but you can't prepay for like
thirty six or twelve months because I
know you can save money do you not like
it's a cheaper option and if you're like
me and you're ordering perfumes online I
know can be super intimidating because
you look online you lose like 200
perfumes and you don't know which ones
good for you
actually have a little quiz you could
take and it recommends perfumes based on
like what you do what you like and all
that good stuff so kind of narrows it
down
I believe they recommended this one to
me and I loved it so it works trust me
so yeah I definitely recommend some bird
if you like to try new perfumes but
don't want to buy a whole bottle every
month it's a super cool company and I'm
really glad that they let me review this
also in here we have a lipstick this is
the deuce one and 9:07 I got this in a
glossy box but it's really pretty like
nudie purpley color it's actually what I
have on my lips right now and I really
like it I also have aqua 4 which is a
necessity because I'm on an acne
medication that dries out my skin so
much so this really helps keep things
nice and moisturized
then I also just have some headphones
because you never know when you're gonna
need to jam out into silly your tunes
also happy Smashbox photo finish primer
water which I love this stuff because
you just spray it on it it kind of
refreshes your makeup now I'm probably
looking real oily but next we have the
Twilight woods body lotion um my hands
get really dry and I like to have
something like this to fit all also have
my glasses which yes I do have to wear
glasses I mean I have to wear them when
I Drive so they look like this they're
just your standards like everybody has
these glasses but yeah I wear them
sometimes to school or other occasions
and there's also a little zip pocket
right here I can see that the hair's
gonna catch on fire in here I have the
orbit sweet gum my favorite gum right
here it's a nice mix between like sweet
and busy then we also have these bad
boys because you know you never know
when that time is just gonna that's
officially everything that's in my purse
I don't carry a ton of stuff I mean I
think this is kind of a lot for me
because I usually like to minimize that
girl's butt and the comments down below
you should let me know what your what
your must-haves purse item is because
you know I'm always looking to add some
stuff that I need in my purse and my
rent ladies yes I've always I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and you should
definitely give it a like if you did so
I can see if you want more sit-down chit
chatting videos like this one I'll see
you guys my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
