my schoolbag video because I know I
posted one of these a while back and it
got a lot of good feedback and so today
I'm going to show you guys what is in my
junior year backpack there are a couple
things I want to say before I start this
video one I have been in school for
about a week now and I'm really not
enjoying it I'm not a huge fan of school
but this year especially it's just been
really hard weaning myself off of this
like YouTube hi I've had all summer and
just like going straight into school if
you know what I mean
the place bear with me as I kind of
transition into YouTube during the
school year it's very difficult and it's
very hard to kind of find this schedule
secondly I know there's dead flowers in
the background of this video but they're
kind of a representation of my life
right now so please excuse those I'm
really just way too lazy to take them
down but I know you guys hate long
intros and so do I so we're gonna go
ahead and get into this video so I've
used the same backpack for the past two
years and I absolutely love it it's one
of these North Face backpacks it's just
gray and it's a gesture I believe not
gonna lie I've seen like five other guys
with the same backpack and it is a
little embarrassing but I still love it
and it's my baby so the thing I thought
about this backpack is you can put so
much stuff in it but it doesn't look
huge you don't look like you have the
freshman backpack if you know I'm saying
so in this front pockets right here I
have a few things first I have my agenda
it's just a lowly puss or agenda and I
like to keep it in the front so it's
like easy to access and I just have a
ruler in here because you always need a
ruler then at the very depth of the
front pocket I have my portable charger
this is a leap how luke own portable
charger I got it off Amazon and it rocks
it's honestly amazing so definitely get
this if you're looking for a portable
charger then I just have my wallet and
it was a wristlet
but then the wrist part broke but I
still love it so I use
wallet and I have lotion because I
noticed that I always forget to put this
on in the morning so I hate having dry
hands so I bring this two-pronged lotion
whenever I forget and I may have a few
snacks in here possibly are you hungry
sorry and I have tic tacs because I
don't like having horrible breath and I
also have my headphones because
sometimes I will listen to music while I
like doing my work or something at
school and then of course I have to have
some flashcards in here because I use
these all the time for studying and they
come in handy quite often then there are
two side pockets and then the first one
I have my glasses because I do wear
glasses built like this they're kind of
just like the typical teenage girl
glasses if you are saying then on the
second one I have my phone and a lot of
people wonder where this case is from
it's from Kate Spade if you're wondering
now that we have ventured upon the giant
pocket which I keep my actual school
stuff in so I'm really really liking how
I organized all my stuff this year I
don't have any binders I just have
folders and notebooks and it's honestly
going great so first I just have my
history folder in my history notebook I
have a three subject because we take
lecture notes and so I take quite a few
notes in this class then I just have my
physics folder in my physics notebook
never English I have this really ugly
folder because I couldn't find any
five-star ones with Brad's and then I
just have my English notebook then for
precal of course you guessed it I have a
notebook and a notebook I can't talk
today I have a folder in a notebook for
pre-cal as well another French I have
this super pretty like hot pink folder I
love it
and then just a composition book which I
got at Walmart for $0.50 so definitely
go to Walmart if you need one of these
and then also I have my pencil case
which I've used this for like three
years now but it's just a makeup bag
from forever 21 and I just keep like
colored pencils and pens and all that
good stuff in here
so that is everything that's in my
school backpack I really hope you guys
enjoyed this and you're enjoying your
school year if you are back make sure to
request any non back to school videos
you'd like to see because I'm kind of
trying
out of those videos if you know what I
mean make sure to follow me on my
Twitter and Instagram to keep up with me
since I will be uploading us often in
the school year I really still like to
even touch with all you guys with all
that said I'm just going to go ahead and
leave you guys so I'll see you guys my
next video hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
