what is on my iPhone 6 video because in
my what I got for Christmas video you
guys saw that I received this and you
really wanted to see it so I decided to
do this video today I have the gold
iPhone 6 and it looks like this and my
case is this really pretty like pearl
one and I believe it's the brand
case-mate so yeah I really like it it
reminds me of a mermaid so of course I
had to buy it I don't think this video
is going to be very long because I don't
have a whole lot of stuff on here I only
keep things that I use so not much sure
about the length of this video but
nonetheless I hope you guys enjoy it so
here is just a closer view of my case if
you'd like to see it better when you
first open up my phone my lock screen is
a picture of Venice because I want to go
to some day and then my background is a
picture of my boyfriend and my dog Roxy
because you know I just love them both a
lot so we have settings up here and it's
just the normal setting the stuff then
there is the clock app which I use often
because I always use this to wake up in
the morning then there's just the
calculator which I use for my science
and math class and then notes which I
keep a lot of little to-do lists and
such in there right here is utilities
and this is honestly just all the boring
stuff that I barely ever touch they're
kind of just all the apps that you can't
delete so I just store them all in that
folder in the social media one we have
the apps or contacts and mail and then
there's the YouTube app which I actually
really like this app I really like how
it's made and it's a really easy design
so I really like the YouTube app so
there's a Twitter app and here's a
little shameless promotion definitely go
follow me on there I tweet often and I
follow some of you guys whenever you say
you're watching my videos and such so
definitely go follow me on Twitter I use
my Twitter app quite often
then there's the Instagram app and
Instagram is my favorite so again follow
me on there I post pretty often on
Instagram I know it's kind of going out
of style but I love my
Instagram so yep definitely go follow me
on there then we have trivia crack which
I don't play all that often but it's fun
sometimes
so my next little folder is music huh
and I have the iTunes Store and the
music app which for some reason it added
all of my music on my laptop on my phone
so I have so many songs so I definitely
need to go through there and delete some
though me a Pandora I love Pandora
because I love listening to music so I
have so many stations it's kind of
embarrassing but I really like it I like
it a lot more than Spotify so we then
have the photos section so I just have
my actual photos here which I have way
too many and then there's pic frame
which you can collage your pictures
together I don't use this too often but
it does come in handy whenever it's
someone's birthday and you want to
collage some pictures together after
white is one of my most used ones it
basically just has like a bunch of
different stuff you can do to your
pictures so there's contrast saturations
so many filters I was actually editing
this one earlier but and then there are
light weeks which I really like light
mix and then dust and just really cool
stuff so I think it's around like $2
maybe or maybe it's free but it's my
favorite squirrel ready is an app that
changes your pictures so they fit on
Instagram I don't use it very much
anymore because after light actually has
a little option to do that alone then we
have I swap faces which is fun to just
like to switch your faces with your
friends or something I actually spent
like $2 on this and I don't know why but
I refuse to delete it since I spent
money on it then there's be funky and
the only reason I use this is cuz it has
like a text adder to your pictures and
they have a really really cool fonts on
here and they actually have the ones on
your laptop on here so we have really
cool fonts and I just think it's fun I
don't use it very often but occasionally
it's nice then we have a school folder
and in here I have an moto which
then there's the SAT question of the day
because I have to take this in January
and so we are preparing and you know
it's nice just to practice a little bit
then there's the Starbucks app and I
actually just got this because I want to
start like getting different cards to
get free drinks and whatnot yeah I just
added one of my cards on here so I think
it'd be good I've seen a lot of
youtubers use this app so I just figured
I would go ahead try it out my last app
on my phone is Poli war and I use this
for my fashion design class if you make
outfits and stuff and so mine is really
really old but so you create different
little like outfit sets and such and
yeah I just have this for that class but
it is a really cool app that is
everything that's on my handy-dandy
little iPhone right here let me know
what some of your favorite apps are
because I'm still kind of exploring and
getting some new things on my phone so
leave those down below and I will try to
reply to some of you guys I will chat
with you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
