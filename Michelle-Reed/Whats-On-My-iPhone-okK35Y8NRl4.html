what's on my iPhone video because I get
requested to do an updated one very very
often so I decided to do an updated one
before I start I want to say that I have
an iPhone forest and on a forest not a
five just an iPhone 4 and it's white and
yeah so let's go ahead and get started
so here's my phone I just have a white
iPhone 4 and my case is from Etsy so I
will link it in the down bar so my
background is of Michael and I and when
you open it up here's what all my little
like apps and such look like so I have
settings right here which is just the
normal settings that come with your
iPhone and then I have a newsstand which
I don't say have no idea what that is
but I never use it
and then I have passbook which is also
just another app that I don't really use
a nice social media in here I have all
my social media apps so I have the app
store contacts then I have mail and then
I have Twitter so I'll leave my Twitter
link in the downbar but I mean I'm
pretty sure everybody knows what Twitter
is and then I have Instagram so I will
also leave my Instagram link in the
downbar but it's definitely my favorite
app and it's the site that I think that
I'm on the most because I love it the
best and then I have the YouTube app
which I mean how am i youtuber so gotta
have that YouTube app but I honestly you
only like this app I like the old one
but you know nothing I can do about it
but yep there's YouTube
I have Facebook but I mean I don't
really go on it that much and then I
have cake which is like a messenger I
mean I my channel which if you want to
make your channel an app on your phone
all you got to do is go to Safari oops
and then go to this little arrow down
here and click Add to Home screen you'll
have like your own app for your YouTube
channel so I think that's cool then I
just have Quizlet because my French
teacher will post flashcards on there
and then I have snapchat which you just
send you know real cute selfies to your
friends and then I have utilities which
I mean it's just all like this up that
comes with an iPhone it's nothing too
interesting
and then iPhoto so I have all my photo
apps so I just have the app which is
just straight up photos and I have all
of my pictures on there then pick up X
which is my favorite photo editing app
so I'll show you
but this honestly just has a ton of
different filters for Instagram pictures
or just pictures in general and there
literally like a ton so yeah I really
like this app I think it is around $2 so
then I pick frame which has tons of
different frames that I like it cuz you
can get rid of the white border so yeah
there's like a bunch of different frames
and I believe it is a dollar I Square
ready and it makes your Instagram
pictures into squares so you can post
them on Instagram whoa
and then I have Vint ich which is just
another photo editing app and it has
lots of different like vintage filters
so there's just a bunch of different
filters on here that you can use and I
really really like it I also like it
because you can edit the filter so you
can like choose what you and what you
don't want in the filter music I just
have all my music apps so I have iTunes
music and then Pandora which is
basically just like a radio for your
iPhone so I just have all these
different stations and it plays music
that is like the artist that you choose
so I really like it then I have the
Bible app which I honestly don't like
well I mean I like the Bible but this
app isn't very good it randomly crashes
on me and stuff so I don't know it's
just kind of annoying but I still have
it cuz I don't know another Bible app
that there is and then I have a one game
which is Temple Run oz because I went
and saw Oz and absolutely loved it so I
was convinced that I needed the Temple
Run version II was like two dollars
which honestly it's not worth two
dollars but it's still fun and it's the
only game that I really play so I mean
this is gonna be really hard to play but
you just kind of go through and you jump
over stuff and go under stuff and I'm
pretty sure everybody knows what tempo
run is but it's really a lot of fun and
I like to light when I'm bored so then
here at the bottom I just had messages
phone Safari and camera cuz I use those
quite often yeah that is everything that
is on my iPhone so that is everything
that is on my iPhone so if you have your
own what's on my iPhone video make sure
to leave it as a video response yeah
whoo you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
