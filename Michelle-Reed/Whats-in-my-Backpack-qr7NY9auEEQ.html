backpack video I had it all done up but
that backpack actually broke in my light
to my room don't work still so I'm just
kind of out of option I still have my
rash on my face from strep but I can
ignore it cuz I need to get up on my
videos and my voice is still weird
because I've strep but you know that's
okay so this is what my backpack looks
like it's a North Face backpack it's
just great it's a gesture if you're
wondering but it looks like this I used
to have one I like the Victoria Secret
pink ones but it gripped a huge hole in
it it was just bad and I really like
this one because it's really durable and
mattress with all my outfit so I know
it's not the cutest but I love it so
when you open up this little section
I'll show you what's inside first I had
my wallet this is just a fossil wallet
it looks like that
I just keep like cards and money and
stuff because sometimes I'll buy my
lunch at school have some pretzels I
have an iPhone charger because by my
lunch table there is an outlet and my
phone dies so quickly so I just bring
this to charge it I have my actual
iPhone I have the CICC Rhett sore throat
little drops because I've strep right
now and these things are awesome cuz
they like numb your throat so I've eaten
a lot of them have tried it splashing
fruit gum I also have my baby lips and
grape vine it's what I have on right now
if you're wondering I have some
flashcards from a quiz that I had and
that is it for everything that's in this
little pocket now for the main pocket
I'll show you what's in here I have my
pencil bag which is just a forever 21
makeup bag because I think it's cuter
than a pencil bag I have some deodorant
I don't know why that's in there I have
my like workbook for math but it has my
state on it so have my planner which is
just a great planner and it has the
leaves on it I think I bought this from
Staples there's like 25 bucks I don't
know why it's that expensive but I just
forget my home working stuff so I just
write it down in here I just have all of
my homework that I need to do in there
so this is my binder it just looks like
this I might put this little cover in it
and then I just put Michelle that I'm
covering up my last name so this is what
it looks like right here I have some
math notes in the
and then I have my geometry folder my
French folder a real geography folder
and then this is my biology folder and
it's kind of full so I had to put it in
and then I just keep my English folder
separate because the hole punches are
all broke and I don't really need to buy
a new folder so and then I have two
notebooks this is my biology one this is
my French one but they have my last name
on it so so that is everything that I
keep in my backpack and I hope you guys
