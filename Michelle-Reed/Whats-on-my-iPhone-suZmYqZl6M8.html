video I had an old one but this was
requested by tio crayon I decided that I
would do this because I like to watch
these and I know other people do as well
also what I'm gonna start doing now is
if you have a specific request make sure
to follow me on Instagram and just
comment on any of my pictures and I'm
gonna start mentioning them in the video
that I do if your request gets chosen I
guess so make sure to do that and you
could be featured in one of my videos
just that's like a little comment so
yeah so this is my iPhone I have the
iPhone 4 before I start I know it's
cracked no need to tell me I know I
dropped it on concrete if you're
wondering in it shattered so I know you
don't need to go comment telling me I'm
well-aware I'll be getting a new one in
March once my upgrades up but for now
I'm just gonna deal with the shattered
Ness it's all have bad this is what my
case looks like it's from Etsy I'll
leave the link down to the seller she
also sends you a free case that's really
cool and she was really sweet and she
ships really fast so if you want this
case I will link it down below I'm not
being told to say that either just I
like so my background looks like this
it's just a picture of me and my sisters
also my nails look like this if you're
wondering so when you unlock my phone
this is what it looks like my background
is a picture of me and Michael right
here I have the little folder called
boring stuff it pretty much just has
everything that comes with an iPhone
here I have social so I have all of my
little social apps I have the YouTube

often on Twitter though and then I have
a photos folder which in here I just
have my photos I have all my photos
right here so yeah nuts up i have pic
effects which is the photo editing app

and I love it so much I think it's
around $2 but it's really awesome and I
use it all the time the knife pic frame
which is my collage app a ton of people
asked me what i use to collage my
pictures it is pic frame it has a ton of
frames to use and I just really like it
I believe it's a dollar if I'm correct
I'm not really sure hey this song I
don't even know what's called a VRE
which I will use occasionally but not
too often so then I have a shenanigans
folder so I've stopped flashlight ABC
family because I used to watch Jane by
design but then it like stopped playing
or whatever then I've Netflix which is
biggest addiction right now cuz I'm
obsessed with Gossip Girl like I watch
way too many episodes a day and I need
to stop but it's so addicting I think
I'm on the end of season 2 I think I'm
on like I don't even know what up so
like 15 or something like that of course
you do have to pay for anything it's
like $8 a month but really like movies
or TV shows get this and I have L for
yourself which I use during Christmas
time and you'd make little videos of
like you and your friends here I'll show
you that's my friend Megan by the way
that's what you do it's really fun and
then I have the Bath and Body Works app
thousand Body Works app which I don't
really use but I think you can get
coupons and stuff so occasionally I only
use that but and they have the game of
life the church that I go to is pretty
far away so in the mornings me Michael
in the show when we're on our way there
will sometimes play a little game
where's my tissue and I'm HBO which is
just another thing like Netflix except
it's all movies I think maybe it's not
I'm not sure they have fun run which I'm
terrible at and I never really play and
less I'm really really bored if in
musica which hasn't really changed since
my last video I just have woes a little
spasm their iTunes Pandora and music

own personalized radio you just pick
your stations and you can listen to
music it's really nice that I like user

I have this one which is called
productivity I have the Holy Bible or
just the Bible app really easy to I get
to books and verses verses like actually
using a Bible cuz I'm pretty slow then I
have sleep time which looks like this
and this is really cool because you can
like monitor your sleep don't know if
it's like legit or anything but it's
really cool I'll show you why I did this
was a long time ago but as you can see
like the oranges when I was awake the
green is light sleep in the blue is like
a deep sleep
just set it on your mattress and it like
monitors help moves I don't know it's
con cool though
and I have Quizlet which in French and
my teacher uploads flashcards on here
for us to study I will use this before I
have like a test or something I can just
go through and like use them as
flashcards so then I have just a
flashcards app in case I run out of

I usually use because I like to be able
to flip them and like put them to this I
