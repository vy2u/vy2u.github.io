what's on my iPhone video and I do have
an iPhone so I figured you know mind as
well also my hair is just up in a
topknot because I really care about it
today because it's summer and I am in a
different setting I'm in front of my
vanity if you're wondering so yeah so
this is my iPhone it looks like this um
I did crack it I was really really
stupid and I dropped it like facedown on
concrete and of course it shattered my
case is from the Apple store if you're
wondering it just looks like that
so my background looks like this it's a
picture for my sister's graduation and
then once you unlock it that is my like
what does it's called home screen so
I've settings right there and then I
have newsstand which I don't even use I
don't really know what that is and then
right here I have this one which is
labeled boring stuff and I just have
like all the stuff that comes with an
iPhone and I have this one which is
social and I have Twitter because they
do have a Twitter and if you want to
follow me I will link it in the down bar
and then I just have my youtube app
because I want YouTube YouTube so i
watched youtube's
well i'm sure i have the app store which
i don't know why is in there but i don't
know where to put it so i just put in
there and then i have contacts and then
I have the mail app which I surprisingly
use a lot because as you can tell I get
notifications when people comment on my
videos so and then I have a Facebook app
which I don't use all that much because
I like Instagram and Twitter better and
then I Skype which I don't use all that
often but you know and then I have
Instagram which richer everybody on this
plane has heard of Instagram it's just a
photo sharing app basically you just
like post pictures of you and you can
put really cool effects on them and
stuff and it's really fun if you want to
follow me on Instagram I will link it in
the down bar but it is a personal
Instagram so yeah it's not for you too
yeah those are all my pictures and then
I have this one which is called photos
so I just have the Photos app i little
SI toos on which i have quite a few and
gift them which i don't use all that
much
I'll show you how it works pictures up
for yourself so like like pick the ones
you want thing looks like that it's a
gift boom is I don't really use it all
that much but occasionally I will use it
then I have my favorite photo editing
app which is called pic effects I think
it's like two dollars but it is so great
it has really cool effects I will show
you and then they have all these really
awesome effects and the ones that I like
the best are called lights they have
really cool just like light effect so
you can top like look isn't that awesome
I'm pretty sure miss glamor offs he uses
this and crazy Ray Ray uses it to have
this folder which is called shenanigans
and I have emojis which I'm pretty sure
anybody who has an iPhone has or uses
emojis they're just like the little
these little bags which if you have an
Android he can't see in it drives you
insane
and I face over light which is probably
very favorite app okay so basically what
you do is you can like switch your face
with somebody else's and it is so much
fun like I was switching Jamie's and
Evelyn's which that one wasn't very good
this one with my sister and Joseph
gordon-levitt and it looks real if I if
I do say myself I think it looks real
yeah that's what it is and it's really
fun and I've picked stitch which is just
a like collaging thing so you can like
make collages and stuff it's all not
great but it's free so then a flashlight
but you would be surprised about how
handy this comes like look how bright it
is like look like look at that rub is
intense it is like super bright which
this goes in handy when it's dark and
look and then I have this one called
musica which I have the iTunes app at
Pandora which is just like a
personalized radio you can like pick
your stations like here I'll show you on
my stations all of my stations and I use
it a lot I use it this morning I think I
was getting ready and I just have the
music app which is just penner and then
I have this folder called languages and
I have this French app which is really
cool cuz I'm trying to learn French
right now if you didn't know that first
level is free and then you can buy 50
levels for five dollars so that's what I
did because I'm trying to learn
frightened that's like 10 cents a level
so I think that's pretty good yeah it
just looks like this and then you play
games and you can like I'm on level 7
and I'm learning like family members
right now yeah and I have translator
because I like to be funny and like say
stuff in different languages then I have
productivity which I didn't label that
productivity just kind of labeled it for
me but I have the Bible because when I
go to church I really like this and when
I'm just reading the Bible um because
you can take notes and you can highlight
stuff which is really convenient and
nice so I don't have to like bring paper
or like a highlighter with me I can just
bring the phone and it has everything I
need so umm highlight stuff ok that's
awkward I like stuff and you can like
put it in main green look it's like
highlighted mint green so you know why
not the knife pocket life which is like
a free calendar it's honestly not that
great I wouldn't really recommend this
app for a calendar but I couldn't find
one that was free that I like but
basically you just have all of your like
things I have all my drill team stuff in
this so she thinks you have like all my
practices and stuff label
it's just really nice and then I have
Nike Plus iPod which I got Nike Free
Runs and I thought they came with like
the little sensor but little did I know
you were saved to buy and it's like $20
so I got this app thinking that I could
like track how much our brand but it
can't because yeah and I can't even
delete it like look Co the other ones
have an X that one does and it doesn't
want me to delete it like use it but
that is everything that is on my lovely
cracked iPhone if you have an iPhone or
an Android or whatever phone you can
just do it what's on my phone video and
you should link it as a video response
