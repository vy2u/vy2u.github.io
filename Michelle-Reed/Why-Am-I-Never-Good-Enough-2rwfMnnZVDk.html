to please someone you should never feel
like you have to be a different person
to please someone and if you ever feel
that way then you need to get out of
that relationship it's not to be the new
year or it is the new year by the time
this video goes up and I feel like there
are a lot of videos on succeeding
reaching your goals finding new
opportunities finding your best self
which i think is awesome I think any
opportunity to do that should be
rewarded and should be encouraged
because I think that's a really good mic
set to have I feel like a lot of times
with the New Year we expect all these
things to happen we expect to succeed
and do really great then my February or
March we started to see that maybe were
not as good as we thought we were we
deal with failure we deal with rejection
if he got really depressed and we get
that question of why am I never good
enough what's today's video I just
wanted to discuss this and talk to you
guys about it it's been something that
I've been thinking about a lot and I
feel like a lot of times I just sit
around I think about these things I
don't actually like asked you guys hey
what do you guys think about this if you
don't really know that much about me I
am currently 18 years old I live in New
York City I'm in college and I feel like
college is one of those times where you
just constantly feel like you're never
really enough and I got a person that
really resists change part of me feels
like I really thrive I'll change and I
really really enjoy it but actually
getting to that and going through change
I'm just gonna have to admit is not the
most fun thing for me a change
approaching I think there's also a fear
of rejection that approaches a well if
you're a failure that comes and I just
want to help you guys deal with the fear
of failure today and why failure can
actually be a good thing so part one of
this video is going to be why failure
can be a good thing at how to deal with
it or two of this is going to be about
not necessarily falling into the
temptation of feeling like you're not
good enough and like you will never be
good enough and then at the end of this
video I'm just gonna take your own
questions because I always like to get
what input you guys have on this I asked
for questions on my Instagram as always
it's just a patch I'll read if you want
to be my next one we live in a world
that really really rewards success and
rewards being the best of being on the
top and not necessarily actually being
on the top of looking like you're on the
top through like social media and
YouTube and Twitter and Instagram but
just looking like you have it all
together like Society often kind of
conditions us
be this way to always look like we're on
and like we have it together just times
when you don't have it together get an
amen I think the first part of dealing
with failure is just saying that people
fail and it's inevitable and it's going
to happen but this start of a new year I
think it's great to take new
opportunities and a plan and have goals
because I think being a goal-oriented
person is a beautiful beautiful thing I
think that's the best person to be but I
think with the onset of creating new
goals you need establish that maybe
these goals are gonna fail and they're
not gonna turn out how you think they're
going to but that's can be a good thing
Junction is one of those things that
just hurts so bad whether it be from a
person you're dating or a person that
you want to date whether it be from a
job whether it be from your friends your
family rejection hurts I'm not going to
deny that no everyone's gonna like you
now every job is gonna accept you not
gonna be able to succeed if every
opportunity that you get but for me
personally that is one of the most
liberating thoughts to have and not
everything is gonna turn out perfectly
and not everything is gonna work your
way because honestly if we're gonna be
candid for a sec I wouldn't want
everything to turn out the way that I
want it to there are so many things in
my life that haven't gone the way that I
planned but there's so much better this
way there's so much better than if I had
tried to plan every step if I try to do
everything first I think the first step
is just admitting that rejection is
gonna happen and it may hurt for a
little while but the end result can be
good you guys don't know I'm a really
really big reader I love reading
whenever I read I just feel like I'm a
sponge I'm just like absorbing all of
this and knowledge one of my favorite
books is actually the power of habit
you've probably heard of this it's a
really popular book basically this book
talks about how to form really good
habits whether that be like working out
being successful in your job being a
goal-oriented person but it talks about
this equation of how to actually
cultivate your thoughts and change the
way that you think to form really good
habits
basically all habits work is there is a
cue there is a routine and there's a
reward and I think what signaling with
failure it really follows this equation
your cue is when you fail you fail you
don't get what you want whether that be
you don't get love from someone you
don't get the job you want your routine
is how you choose to react to this and
choose to a react and be really really
disappointed you can mope around you can
be scared you can feel very self pity
for yourself you can be upset
or you can see this as a good thing and
see it as this half didn't go how I want
it to so how can I take it another way
and the last part your reward is what
you actually get from that experience so
for me personally I find if I take the
negative path and I get really upset
with myself and I get down on myself and
I sit around and I moan about it for a
while I don't get anything from that
experience simply learn that I need to
stop crying my bed more whenever you
choose the positive outlook and seeing
failure as something that can be a good
thing you actually get so many more
benefits from it I think so many times
whenever we think about failure we think
about rejection we give it like this
lofty idea and how to react to it and we
don't necessarily give it concrete ways
to deal with it when it is something
that's practical you just stop putting
it above and beyond this realm that we
can't reach but it's really simply just
putting yourself out of the situation
I'm not gonna sit here and lie and say
this is how I've always dealt with
failure because it's not I have been
upset by failure or rejection for six
months at a time I never truly get over
it and I feel like I'm over and I feel
like I'm doing better but I'm still
thinking about it I think dealing with
failure rejection is something that I've
always just kept learning to be better
at but it is a practical way of thinking
let's take a part of this video I want
to talk about is being inadequate and
feeling like you're not good enough I
know you've probably heard this enough
and you've heard it from so many people
your mom your dad your friends your
boyfriend and whatever it may be there's
no such thing it's not being good enough
I think there are certain instances
where you're not cut out for a job and
maybe you don't have all the skills and
the talents that you need but it doesn't
mean that you're not good enough that
simply means that job is not fit for you
but there is something else that will be
there relationships I think it's so easy
whenever you break up with someone or
you're not even dating someone and you
lose that relationship to feel like
you're inadequate to feel like you're
not needed and to feel like something
within you is messed up there's a much
bigger problem than just dealing with
failure or rejection I definitely think
but it's not you I think what the
relationship it's simply you're not
compatible with someone something wasn't
working there was a rift in the equation
and I think to some degree you can work
to fix that but I don't think it's ever
you fixing yourself to change to be a
certain way to fit a certain mold
to be better to be good or feel like you
have to change to please someone you
should ever feel like you have to be a
different person to please someone and
if you ever feel that way then you need
to get out of that relationship or out
of that friendship because it's not
healthy and there are so many other
healthy relationships that you could be
in so now I'm gonna go into Instagram
and get a little bit more specific from
you guys how do you do with feeling like
you have no talent and anything I am
definitely the kind of person that I
will look at myself I would be like I'll
compare myself to other people and I
will look at these people were so big
and great and I'll be like I have
absolutely no talent the three to them
personally I believe this is my opinion
it might not be yours that we are all
given specific talents specific gifts
from God that we are meant to pursue
even if you aren't a Christian even if
you don't believe in God I feel like you
can believe that every one of us has
something within us that we can't pursue
I think a lot of time as we think of
talents as being super athletic being
super driven being really smart and
intelligent and these kind of big ideals
but sometimes our talents are much
smaller than that time that's being
really good at working with people
sometimes it's being really good at
talking sometimes it's about being
really good with our hands and creating
things and working with things things
that may seem much smaller and not like
a talent but I think they can't be a
talent so for me personally whenever I
think about a job and I think about
career I think about the little things
about me that might be a little
different that I might be a little bit
better at can I pursue those things and
because I think those are my talents and
those are things that I am good at the
combat the feeling of jealousy that
leads to feeling inadequate best answer
that I can have is to quit it I think I
started to think this way about two
years ago whenever someone would succeed
or do well I would just be thankful for
them I'd be thankful that there are
people who are so talented that can do
those things and I'd be so so happy for
them instead of seeing other people
succeeding I was like a threat to you or
feeling like they're better than you
seeing that as oh my gosh that person is
so so cool and I want to work hard like
that too I think that's the mindset to
have so you had a lot of questions about
college rejection because I know this is
the time when you're probably starting
to get those letters in but all I can
say is one be happy that
I'd be happy that you filled out the
application that you've worked your
hardest and that's all you can do in the
end is work hard matter how intelligent
you are smart rich poor whatever it may
be you can always work hard and I know
you don't want to hear that there are
other fish in the sea but there are
there are other colleges that are going
to accept you and that are going to be
good I know we have dream schools I know
we have places that we feel like we will
find fulfillment out of but there is
always another plan you still provide
you just as much fulfillment there are
other fish in the sea you have any
specific activities such hobbies that
you like to do that help you pick you
back up again once you've fallen down
yes feel like it's really important to
have practical ways to pick yourself up
instead of just changing your mindset
because that can be a lot harder to do
so practical things that I like to do is
one going for a walk it's the simplest
thing but it really does clear mine to
having a day to not go on the internet
not going on social media YouTube the TV
whatever it may be just block it out
three writing down my thoughts is
something that's so important to me I
know it seems kind of dumb just to write
out how you're feeling but once you
start doing it you get used to it you
really do feel like you're getting stuff
off your chest praying and it's having
times of silence just to think is also
really important and lastly telling
people I think letting people know how
you're feeling is so important because
hey they can give you input and be
you're actually getting it out and
you're having an outlet and you're not
simply holding in all these thoughts
which can be very very dangerous if you
do that for too long so that is the end
of this advice video I really hope this
