you're new to my channel i am doing a
Q&amp;amp;A video today i haven't just sat down
and talked to you guys for a while i
just want out instagram and i asked her
questions through my dia because that is
my favorite way to do these videos I
also got this hat because I'm doing a
couple of Halloween outfits ideas video
and I felt this hat of the thrift store
and I thought it was cute and so if you
don't like it you don't have to let me
know I'm doing this thing where I try to
get are my comfort zone and I do small
things that like kind of put me over the
edge and wearing a beret it's kind of
one of those things so just let me have
my moment so definitely make sure to
turn on my post notifications down below
because I don't like it's that day that
I upload but you will not miss out on
them if you have those on you should
also subscribe if you're new I'm just
gonna go ahead and get right into it
where do you get your fashion
inspiration from you always look so cute
and trendy but still so modest thank you
so much I don't really have like an
inspiration I don't necessarily look at
fashion blogs that much I kind of just
order things that I think are really
cute I don't think a modesty is
something that like I'm dressing a
certain way to prevent a certain kind of
attention like my goal in dressing
modest is not because like I don't want
guys to like look at me a certain way
that's not necessarily it whenever I
dress modestly and like the clothes that
I'm wearing are like simple for me I
think that allows people to focus on
like the ideas that I have the thoughts
that I have and like what I'm saying and
Who I am as a person rather than what
I'm wearing
I've noticed whenever like I wear
something that's a little more flashy or
something that draws more attention
people are less likely to kind of like
see Who I am as a person when I really
like I wear clothes like that like I
would not want myself to be know about
what I'm wearing I mean oh by the person
that I am and the things that I say and
what I can contribute to other people
not necessarily like what I'm wearing
will you ever get a tattoo if so what
would you get I'm not opposed to tattoos
I would honestly like get one but I
don't have anything that I would ever
really want to get I don't have anything
that's that important and I also don't
think I would want something permanently
on my body but I'm not opposed to them
I've always thought that tattoos are
really cute but I don't think I would
actually get one what are the three
hardest things about living in New York
City I love this question because I feel
like there is this stigma that like
living in New York is just the best
thing
and it's like this dream world and
everything's perfect and that is just
not true living here is really difficult
like it is just a hard place to live but
it teaches you so much so it's worth it
getting from point A to point B is so
much harder here now it may seem easier
because if you have the subways and
everything and so it looks like it would
be really simple just think it from
place to place but it's not the subways
like are always down there not working
you can't just like drive somewhere for
five minutes it has to be like a day it
work to you off you want to get
somewhere you can't carry a lot of stuff
you see all have a car getting groceries
it's really difficult it's just
traveling here it's a lot different
number two it's super expensive here you
probably know that like eating out and
getting groceries is like the same price
and sometimes I'm just like why am i
spending so much money but I could be
saving so much more at home any lastly
friendships here are a lot more
difficult for a lot of people in New
York it's just a middle city it's not
necessarily like your home it's not like
the end destination it's kind of just
like it means to get somewhere and so
people don't necessarily invest in
friendships I feel like because they
don't think they're gonna be here
permanently it is more difficult to meet
people but it makes it more worthwhile
when you find someone who you just it
just makes it more worthwhile though
whatever you do find someone that you
connect with because you're in it
together and like you value it more how
do you feel like you're not wasting your
college days / being lame when you
choose to not go to huge parties and
choose to follow Christ / invests in
your studies instead for me what I've
started to do more is look at things
that like feed my soul in a positive way
om I got is something that like does
bring me joy but also allows me to
glorify God and to like make his name
known and magnify him above myself I
don't think that that and like finding
joy or mutually exclusive feel like a
lot of times as a person I think that I
have to enjoy things just because other
people enjoy them and that's just not
the case
I started just like looking at
activities and like if they fed my soul
and I felt true joy doing them then I
just pursued them so like reading a
really good book because I had a
stressful week like that is positive to
be hanging out with people that just
like build me up and don't just make me
feel good but like challenge me and just
like make me a better person like that
feeds my soul there like for me going to
a party sitting in a group of friends
who are gossiping looking at things on
the internet that just make me sick
like those things don't bring me joy so
I should not feel inclined and do that
it's so much easier than we make it off
to be like do things that benefit us a
person and that grow you as a person if
they don't like don't do that but what
is your favorite thing to do even when
you want to stay on a low budget
hashtag dating life I so feeling you on
this one because New York is expensive
but actually living here there are so
many really cool free things to do I
love sitting in the park and just
reading with them that's one of my
favorite things like getting a picnic
blanket getting food just going outside
and like enjoying life that is such a
nice thing to do we aren't really like
museum people but if you like museums
that is also another free option that's
really fun to do as a date I want to get
over a three-year relationship because
your girl needs help any the first thing
to know is that you don't have to get
over something for the sake of getting
over it like just because you've been
broken up with just over two weeks
doesn't mean you have to be over them I
think the first thing is acknowledge
that you're a smart girl and like you
dated this person for a reason and that
probably means that like part of you
still loves them and that's okay that's
not bad like a motion to field because
you broke up with someone or even
something like a job but there's a
reason why you did that and you're a
smart person and you can still love this
person but not necessarily like be with
them long term for me I think it's
really important to get off your phone
don't go on Instagram don't go on
Twitter to hone Facebook and like check
up on this person like if you love them
you will want them to succeed too and
always like looking at what they're
doing it analyzing them like that's not
healthy for you and that's not healthy
for him get off your phone and get into
the world and what I mean by that is
just pursue people and pursue hobbies
and activities that like maybe you
didn't get to do while you're dating
whenever you're actually pursuing things
that like to some degree bring you the
same happiness you felt with him then
you're gonna feel more complete as a
person and you're gonna feel like you
can grow beyond the relationship the
average drop whenever you transition
from high school to college I'm having a
hard time accepting that minded yes
college is harder than high school and
you're gonna get grades that like back
in high school you couldn't even imagine
getting and that's okay you have to like
failed to some degree
actually come back from your mistakes
and if you just keep getting AIDS all
the time like just think you're not
gonna learn like how to be better that's
