doing the video about the things that I
hate about school because I know that
most of you guys are probably just going
into school or you've already started it
so I'm going to take a break from all
those cheery back to school videos and
just kind of reveal the truth about
school I'm going to be honest this is
going to be a rant video and I am gonna
be a little bit negative so if I'm gonna
tread on your positive vibes you might
want to X out in this video but I'm just
not really in the mood to do a cheery
video because I'm actually quite not
happy right now so let's just go ahead
and get into this now it doesn't matter
if you have like a ton of people you
know at your school or you have a ton of
friends in your classes the first day of
school is always so awkward
everyone's returning from summer and
it's like these gremlins who've just
transformed and these things you don't
even know and you're like you even are
you everyone's changed it's all really
awkward and they just kind of like don't
talk to each other you're just like is
this really happening
I want talking about is there's always
one kid in your class who literally
never has a pencil like every single day
you'll come to school and be like oh
someone give me a pencil please and me
being the nice and generous person I am
I usually lend my pencils other people
and then I don't get them back I know
that pencil may not have been the best
pencil the world but do not take my
kindness for granted now I don't really
know about you guys at school but mine
is so unpredictable you know one day
it'll be like a meat locker and the next
day it's like Satan's chamber I don't
know it's Satan's chamber but seriously
like I never know what to wear I'll come
to school and I'm either freezing like
I've goose bumps that I probably just
shaved my legs so I'm a little angry or
I'm like dripping in sweat and I smelt
disgusting there is no in-between
there's no in-between
now this may not be something you have
at your school if you don't bless you
you are lucky but at my school there's
like a designated hallway where people
go to make out you will see people
eating each other's faces slash body
parts like I promise you there will be
teachers walking by and they're still
making out like go to the janitor's
closet or something and do that but do
not do it at school it's so
inappropriate and it's disgusting but I
promise like teachers get together and
they're like okay we're all gonna have
our test on Thursday so you know Monday
Tuesday Wednesday will go pretty well
and then Thursday BAM
every single class you have a test and
they're all hard and it's terrible maybe
all the science teachers do it on Monday
but no every teacher has to on the same
day and it's not a game I know that I'm
a girl and you may think girls are
really clean and everything but I've
never gone to the bathroom without there
being wastes on the toilet maybe that's
because we have really fancy air dryers
but not toilet cleaner but I don't know
why the bathrooms are so disgusting and
there's always these huge lines so you
can never go in the passing period and
overall just the bathroom experience at
high school is terrible now basically
the scrub term is whenever you're having
a comfy day and you know you didn't have
a whole lot of time to get ready so
you're just writing kind of your comfy
clothes like whatever I'm totally for
that that's all good but the thing is
they'll have like a full face of makeup
hair curled like legs shaved and you can
tell they put working its appearance and
they're like oh I woke up ten minutes
late I was like girl I know you took 20
minutes to do that smokey eye like don't
even lie to me where would you want
where what makes you comfortable but
don't lie and say it took you 10 minutes
to get ready
now this has definitely happened
everyone I know you guys are with me on
this but we'll be in a class where you
actually don't know anyone like you're
one class where you're just completely
loading in the teacher will be like okay
find the partner in like 30 seconds
and you're just like it's because I'm
incredibly antisocial and awkward but
this gives me anxiety it almost always
the teacher will be like hey who is I'm
a partner who does own partner I'm
always the one who's like
but that experience is just the worst
that is everything that I do not like
about school I'm not a fan now I'm not
saying school is absolutely terrible or
anything like there are good things I
understand it's necessary but sometimes
you just gotta ran to get a little bit
off your chest I hope you guys still
love me after this video and maybe leave
down below what your most annoying thing
about your school is because I
definitely like to hear your pet peeves
also let me know when you guys are going
back to school in any last minute back
to school videos you'd like me to do and
I'll see you guys my next video adios
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
