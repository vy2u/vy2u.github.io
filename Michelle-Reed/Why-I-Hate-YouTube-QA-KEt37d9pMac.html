hear that that hurts so bad guys today I
am so excited because I'm going to be
doing a Q&amp;amp;A for you guys I honestly have
just been so busy lately and I haven't
just gotten to sit on my bed and chill
and talk to you guys so I am honestly
filled with joy right now to be doing
this video we're also gonna spice it up
a little bit and I'm gonna get questions
from both Twitter and Instagram so
follow me on those if you want to be
featured in my next Q&amp;amp;A make sure to
give this video a thumbs up if you like
watching videos to learn more about me
because I think it's fun and you like to
see who you really subscribe to and all
the depths of that person and this
sounds really creepy so we're just gonna
go ahead and get into this page we're
going to start off with these Twitter
questions and Lauren omen actually ask
me question if she goes to my school so
hello Lauren oh she asked me what my
dream college would be and I honestly
have no idea I am actually going to New
York to look at schools at April and I'm
really excited but i have no idea where
i want to go i honestly don't even know
like what my dream school would be so
hopefully by april i will be able to
tell you what my dream school is but for
now i don't really know Kate Hudson's
asked the people were mean to me when I
first started making videos at my school
and no one was really mean to me no one
really told me what they thought I think
for me I'm not a people pleaser i am the
complete opposite of a people pleaser so
I really don't care what people think
about me and if I enjoy doing this I'm
gonna keep doing it so long story short
and no nobody was really mean to me
barks k asked how I maintained a really
good upload schedule and what helps me
stay focused while editing videos so to
be completely honest I don't think I
have that great of an upload schedule I
used to do every like monday and
thursday but that's just kind of gone
off I definitely try to upload at least
every week if it's any less than that
and I'll think people are going to
really
continuously watch your videos because
they're gonna be like where are you ads
for the editing question I think it's
important to kind of break up your
editing you just sit down and edit a
video for like five hours it's not going
to be that great you're gonna be tired
you're gonna lose a lot of your
creativity so definitely just break it
up into maybe like two hour sessions or
something and I think that just works a
lot better for me personally Chloe
kathleen wants to know how many siblings
i have and i actually have four I don't
know if that's something that a lot of
you guys know but I have a pretty big
family and I love it it's the best thing
ever but I have two sisters and two
brothers and they are all older than me
so yes I do have siblings ever being
honest here twitter is kind of lacking
in the questions right now so we're just
gonna go over to Instagram Julie O'Brien
18 wants to know what my favorite thing
about YouTube is a my least favorite
thing about YouTube so my favorite thing
would just be getting to make these
videos about whatever you want and then
people giving you feedback I think it's
just the coolest concepts ever and to
whoever invented YouTube you are a
genius because it's so awesome just
getting to like sit here and film for
you guys I can't really think of
anything that I don't like about you to
even like hate comments have taught me a
lot about how to just be confident even
though people don't support what I'm
doing and they've actually made me have
very tough skin because i never used to
in middle school but now that I'm in
high school and I'm used to these
comments that people leave you know I
could honestly face the world because
it's made me such a stronger person so I
love YouTube in all aspects it is great
Winnie and yucca do I know I butcher
that I'm sorry but she asked if I plan
to do YouTube as a full-time thing or a
full-time job and no i don't youtube is
a hobby for me it's kind of my creative
outlet the thing that i do whenever I'm
not working I mean everybody makes
different decisions but mine would just
not be to have you two as a full-time
job because I never want to feel like
it's something that I do just to eat hay
because I think things start to get a
lot less genuine whenever the only
reason
doing it to make money but I'm always
gonna do it as a hobby and I'm not gonna
stop anytime soon because I love it but
um I do plan on getting a job in my near
future and going to college and all that
good stuff Patti Thompson asked what is
one thing that I wish someone would have
told me about high school and I'm going
to have to think about this one
definitely your freshman year don't
slack off I hear all the time people
saying like oh my gosh my GPA would be
so good if I didn't totally not care
freshman years so if you are a freshman
in high school you're going to be work
hard because it matters definitely work
hard all years of your high school so
that you can chill your senior year
because i'm gonna be a senior next year
and i'm so done with all this stress of
junior year like just work hard freshman
year so you can get to that point a lot
of people want to know what I want to
major in in college and like I said
before it's so kind of undecided I mean
I have an idea I'm thinking did you guys
hear that that hurts so bad I'm kind of
thinking of something in fashion
merchandising because I love fashion and
i really like kind of the whole like
marketing aspect of clothing stores and
such so i think that would maybe be a
good place but for now I have no idea
Liam a wants to know what my favorite
thing to do in my thing what my favorite
thing to do in my free time is and a lot
of you guys don't know this but I'm
actually on my high school's varsity
dance team and I do that every morning
7am I practice pretty much every morning
and we're in competition season so it's
crazy so YouTube is definitely not the
only thing that I do that kind of takes
up the rest of the time that I have my
granny wants to know what I'm looking
forward to for spring / summer and it's
definitely beautycon I'm going to be
Vikan here in Dallas it's actually Texas
no one ever comes to Texas and I'm
stoked so I'm definitely looking forward
to that it's my first youtube event and
I'm so excited let me know if you guys
are coming because I really hope I get
to meet some of you guys and I'm
actually so excited to meet other
youtubers because like I said it's my
first youtube event and I'm just like
definitely hope that I see you guys
there I just went to turn off my camera
and I think that it stopped recording so
I'm so sorry if it cut off any questions
leave them down below if i didn't get to
answer some of yours i'm going to be
filming a lot coming up some may be new
spring videos because spring is my
favorite season and it is my jam and i'm
ready to take it youtube wise so they
are passed down below follow me on
