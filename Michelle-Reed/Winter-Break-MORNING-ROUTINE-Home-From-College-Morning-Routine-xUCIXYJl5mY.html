be a winter break kind of morning
routine or just kind of my more relaxing
routine one at home for college
basically I wake up and while I'd like
to say that I read a book I usually do
like check my emails when I wake up I
only do this for like five minutes and
then I will hop right on out of bed and
then I usually go light a candle because
I really like making my room super cozy
in the morning because I'd like to get
work done sometimes in the morning here
and then I will go and ahead and make my
bed I'll also go turn off my fan because
I like the sound of sleeping with a fan
so and then I usually go my sister
Jamie's room if you watch my vlogs you
so know this
I'll go see Roxy and let her on Jamie's
bed and we'll kind of just like sit and
cuddle for a sec and then I'll head in
the bathroom and I'll just brush my
teeth and then I'll usually go ahead and
wash my face as well I like to apply
moisturizer in the morning so I usually
use this clinic sample one that I have
this is like my favorite Moisture Surge
it's so so good so this is my favorite
part of the morning I will make some
French press coffee I recently got this
for Christmas and so I'll go ahead and
boil some water and then I'll grind up
my beans which I didn't used to do
recently I started doing and then I'll
pour those into the French press and I
will kind of let them sit over top of
the coffee grounds for 45 seconds and
then I will pour the rest of the water
in and I'll let it sit for three and a
half minutes and then I'll go ahead and
stir it up and then I'll let it sit for
like a minute and a half more and then
I'll push the French press down and
there you have an awesome cup of French
press coffee and whenever I make my
coffee I usually like to sit and get
some work done so I'll go my laptop and
as you guys know I have been vlogging up
a storm so this is usually when I upload
my vlogs in the morning so I'll go ahead
and do like last-minute edits then go
ahead and upload them you should
definitely subscribe to my vlog Channel
in 2018 I'm gonna be vlogging so so much
that's like my goal and then I'll go
ahead and hop in the shower I've been
listening to the cocoa
soundtrack lately and I'm all I do I
make up I like to listen to a podcast so
this is the Eileen Fisher how I built
this and a lot of small designers and
small companies would come there and
show their things I usually start off
with my Laura Mercier primer and then
I'll go in with my Too Faced foundation
this is the one that has a coconut oil
in it and I'll apply my fit me concealer
I am NOT a beauty guru so I'm not gonna
go over like the full names of these
products I'll go ahead and apply my
Maybelline fit me powder all over just
kind of set everything and then I'll go
in with my Too Faced Park a princess
bronzer and I'll just apply this to my
cheekbones my forehead kind of make me
look a little bit less pale and then I
just applied a little bit of a peachy
pink blush and then my Laura Mercier
highlighter and then this benefit gimme
brow I'll just kind of run that through
my eyebrows and then I use the Too Faced
natural eye palette I take the cream
shade and apply that everywhere and then
I take this kind of taupe color and put
it in my crease then I'll just line my
eyes very lightly with some eyeliner and
then I will curl my eyelashes and apply
my scandalize mascara and then I'm
applying this fierce laura mercier
lipstick that's the name of it I think
it's a really pretty reddish-brown color
and then I just added a few soft waves
to my hair I just used like a one-inch
curling iron it's nothing like too fancy
we actually met my dad for lunch at this
really nice little like lunch view place
and so we had a dress business casual so
this is what I wore a lot of you guys on
Instagram we're asking about this outfit
so I decided to throw it in my top is
from Express I really like it's a kind
of see-through but it's still classy and
then my scarf so many of you guys were
wondering about I actually thrifted it
from a thrift store so it was like $15
my shoes are from the brand mark fisher
from DSW and then these pants they look
like jeans they're actually H&amp;amp;M work
pants they were like five dollars and
that is it for my morning routine and
obviously at any breakfast because we
kind of had like a late breakfast lunch
and so that is what we were eating here
but I hope you guys enjoy it make sure
