basically what my morning routine looks
like in the winter time I love doing
these videos seasonally just because
they're really fun to see how your
routine changes don't buy the changes
like a whole lot or drastically but it's
just a little bit of the change and
they're really fun to film if you're new
to my channel you should definitely
subscribe the button will be right here
I upload every Thursday and an
occasional Sunday so you should
definitely click that button and
subscribe to my channel and with all
that being said we're gonna go ahead and
get into the video so the first thing
that I do and I wake up in the morning
is grab my laptop and edit my vlogmas
video from the previous day I have been
posting on my other channel Michelle out
of her shell and I've been vlogging
every single day so go check it out down
below or click the link right here
because it's so much fun and I love
vlogging and then I will just make my
bed and I have to do this every single
morning to start off my morning and then
I'll put my hair into a bun and have a
really bad piece of hair sticking up and
I'll wash my face brush my teeth and
just get ready for the day
then I will go make myself a cup of
coffee I've been loving the Christmas
blend from Starbucks it is awesome it's
kind of just like a spicy coffee I don't
know it tastes really really good though
so I'll make that and some breakfast
this morning I had an egg in a hole
which is basically just an egg inside a
piece of toast and it's really really
yummy so I just enjoyed that and watched
some blog misses and all that good stuff
then I will hop in the shower but I
actually showered the night before
already in this video suffer makeup what
I've been doing is priming my face with
the Smashbox photo finish primer love
that stuff and then I will apply my
foundation with my Beauty Blender this
is the covergirl Ready Set gorgeous and
then I fit me concealer under my eyes
and then I'll set everything with my
Rimmel stay matte powder I'm contouring
with my hoola bronzer and then I'm using
The Rocketeer blush from benefit which
I've been loving lately and I'll fill in
my brows just a little bit with my
Anastasia brow pencil for eyes I use my
Naked 3 palette and I'll just put a
cream shade on my lid the kind of
neutral shade in my crease and then a
little bit of a darker shade in the very
outer corner and it's a very simple
makeup look but it's really really
pretty then I will apply a thin line of
eyeliner and some mascara this was the
rocket mascara it's my absolute favorite
and then I'm applying this lipstick
which is from Rimmel I believe is scene
number 104 it's a really pretty matte
reddish pink color and then I'm just
adding a little bit of a wave to my hair
to give it some texture and that's it
for my look also thank you to Rose for
letting me borrow this onesie it is so
comfy and it's so so perfect
here is my typical winter outfit it's
pretty hot here in Texas so I don't have
to wear a jacket and also I know it
looks fancy but it's comfier than
wearing pants my dress is from brandy
melville my best is from hmm this
necklace is made well my tights are from
H&amp;amp;M as well and then my boots are from a
kind of knock-off designer brands store
kind of sketchy but really nice and then
I'm paired it with my Daniel Wellington
watch which I'll have linked down below
along with the coupon code it's awesome
and such a perfect gift too so that's
basically my outfit for the winter time
