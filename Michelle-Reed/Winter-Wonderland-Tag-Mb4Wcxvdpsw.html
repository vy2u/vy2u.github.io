tag video this is going to be the winter
wonderland tag which was created by one
of my really good friends on YouTube
Emma or beauty guru for you and she's
tiny to do this and I have done nothing
Christmasy so I decided to change that
also it kind of snow to slush ice here
at yesterday and so everything's all
bitin pretty and so inspired me to
something Christmasy also I'm kind of
trapped in my house so that's why I want
to do this also I have all the questions
here on my laptop and so if I keep
looking down that it's wrong first
question is what do you like best about
winter and I would just say I am a lover
of cold weather it is my thing I love it
so much I was born in Chicago and so I
kind of just loved the cold weather in
the winter he just gets all cold and I
get to wear all my cozy sweaters and
scarves and it makes me very very happy
second its scarves or be needs now I
would say beanies but every time I try
to wear one I end up looking like this
so those are kind of a no-go so I'd have
to say scarves because me and beanies
just don't work there question is what
is your favorite holiday movie and mine
would probably be jingle all the way and
so what about the dad and he gets like
get the toy for his son but it's like
sold out or something you know I'm
talking about I don't know why but I
feel like once I watch that movie the
conditionally Christmas it's just
something that I've watched since I was
little and I really love it first
question is what is your favorite winter
nail polish and I couldn't just pick one
so I have to to show you guys the first
one is se-jin chilly it's a good dark
gray muddy taupe color I guess it's very
pretty
neutral I kind of just matches with
everything I love it I also have after
school boy blazer which is like a dark
navy and I love this as well I love the
rest on my toes but it's almost like a
purple univie
then have any pretty colors so L above
the bees and walk 7:5 is your favorite
holiday Starbucks drink which is very
hard but I would probably say the
peppermint hot chocolate that's very
just kind of something that I always
loved every single year it doesn't get
old and I try to make it myself but it
just doesn't taste as good
about number six is what are your top
three winter essentials and so the first
one would be riding boots these are my
ones from Steve Madden and I absolutely
love them they're like a dark brown
color the red and gold zipper on the
side and they're so pretty and he has
everything and I wear them so much but I
love these a lot and I have a long time
ago and so they were a lot cheaper than
they are now but I'll make sure to leave
them in the downbar I think they're like
the scribble boots secondly going to be
scarves on this is my favorite one for
the winter because it's just cream and
it matches with everything and it's huge
and it keeps me warm but I literally
have so many scarves and I wear them so
often because they honestly just keep
you warm and they're really really cute
and then lastly I really really like
these like head wraps that you can wear
like I said before I can't pull off
beanies and so I got to keep my ears
warm somehow so I like these wrap things
this one is just like black and white
and gray and it looks like this I have
no idea where this one's from cuz it was
my sister's and I also have this braided
brown one that is a lot thicker but this
one is from j.crew and I love these both
they're really cute and easy to pull off
so I love all those winners of number 7
is name one item that is on your
Christmas wish lists this year and I'm
only asking for one thing this year and
it is a Caroline's it is the Sony 830
550 millimeter one I think just because
Hello Kitty XO thumps are lookbooks with
a 50 millimeter lens and they look so
pretty and I just wanted a new lens
instead of just using the standard long
which is what I'm using now r8 it's your
favorite holiday song and this is very
hard
probably called a jolly Christmas so I
Michael Buble is my favorite because I
love that song a lot and it gets me in
the Christmas mood it doesn't really get
old like a lot of other Christmas songs
number 9 is are you going Black Friday
shopping this year and I actually
already went so I guess this was my
phone poor then but yeah I already why's
that I have a haul up if you want to see
it I'll make sure to link it down below
but I had a lot of fun and I got some
good deals so
I think of Black Friday shopping number
ten is what is your must-have winter lip
products and that would be the one I'm
wearing right now this is clinics
Merlotte's lipstick it's just a dark
like very red color and it's so pretty
and I have it on right now and I love it
I've worn in like my past three videos
lipstick is awesome because in the
winter my lips get really dry but this
is super moisturizing and it just I love
this lipstick so much as you can tell
I've been wearing it quite a bit
so number eleven is will you be rocking
an ugly Christmas sweater this year and
yes I will I have an ugly Christmas
party that I'm going to and I actually
already got my sweater and so I decided
to show you guys it looks like this is
awesome and it has just white snow and
snowmen on it and Santa Claus and
snowflakes and it's so perfect
yes I love this I ordered this off of at
scene it was extremely cheap and I'm
actually probably gonna wear that to
school closer to Christmas because I
love it a lot I don't care if it's ugly
well it's have you ever had a white
Christmas where you live and I have
actually like three or two years ago I
think the I wanted it was so pretty
there was so much snow and where I live
it does not snow very often so it was so
exciting and I loved it so much and it
was so pretty
thirteen is your favorite when their
candle scent and mine would definitely
be the twisted peppermint candle I
absolutely love this candle um it is
perfect it just smells like peppermint
which is kind of my scent for Christmas
and I absolutely love it I burned it a
lot doesn't look like it burned it but I
burned it so much since I bought it on
Black Friday the last question is how
will you be celebrating your Christmas
this year and I'll just be celebrating
with my family and won't be anything too
crazy it should be a lot of fun I get to
see my brother Derek which is exciting
cause he lives in New York and I also
get to see my sister-in-law Avery which
I'm very excited
see because I haven't seen them since
August so that's very exciting but yeah
we kind of just have a close family
Christmas and I'm really excited so
that's the end of this tag video and I
tagged all of y'all to do this I don't
think I'm gonna tag specific people just
because I feel like a lot of people have
already done this but I made text people
down below so check your name if you
want to do this but also if you want to
do this and I did it tagged you feel
free to do it because I love seals
videos of this an audio mixer I love to
