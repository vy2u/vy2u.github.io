bringing you my workout routine I know I
did one of these not too long ago but I
wanted to go more in depth so I'm giving
you guys the exact ab exercises I do
exactly leg exercises and the exact arm
exercises so I work out about 5 to 6
times a week you watch my blogs you
definitely know I always work out I do
it because I like being fit and I think
that it makes you feel good and it makes
me healthy and so I enjoy it so I don't
do this just to like be skinny or
anything of course
I definitely switch this up this isn't
exact but it's pretty exact I'm also a
teenager so if I don't do things exactly
right or if it doesn't work for you it's
just what works for me you're gonna be
one of those people that comments and
critiques everything I do
bye and like always if you're new and
you don't know who I am my name is
Michelle Reid and I upload videos twice
a week and I'd really love for you to
subscribe because it's a fun time here
on my channel so yeah let's just go
ahead and get into the video so I always
like to start off with cardio for 30
minutes I will either run three miles at
six and a half miles per hour
or I will run one mile at six miles per
hour and then do thirty minutes of the
Stairmaster not thirty minutes 20
minutes but yeah I really like cardio I
know a lot of people tell me like you
should do weight training but cardio
just makes me feel so good it's such a
great way to get out my energy and so I
always make sure to do this I know I
look really funny when I run I can't
help it but both of these workouts are
equally equally as difficult so if it's
an app day this is the ab routine I will
do it takes about roughly thirty minutes
I started off by doing just 20 reps of
these leg downs which really work your
lower abs you just pull your legs down
and you can put your arms up for more
resistance if that's not hard enough for
you and then I do 20 reps of these heel
taps and then I just do 30 reps of these
kind of reverse crunches which again
just work your lower abs and these look
really funny to do at the gym but and
then I do 30 reps of these just little
leg up and down things and I put my arms
up these makes it harder and then I do
two 10 SEC it holds on each leg
then I do 25 reps of these bicycle
bicycle abs with my legs fully extended
and then I'll do 30 seconds of flutter
kicks which also work the lower abs and
then I just do 30 reps of your standard
sit-up making sure to sit all the way up
and then 15 reps of these ones which I
can't even explain they're so hard
though they really really work me but I
saw it in a block a lot easier and then
I do 30 reps of these toe touches and
then I do 10 reps of just these complete
toe touch ones these ones also really
really work me they're really hard and
then I do 25 reps of bicycle app
workouts and then I move on to 30 reps
of these toe touches or ankle touches
and these work your obliques and then I
take a 10-pound weight and I do 30 reps
of Russian twists and then I just do 30
reps of your standard set up on each
side which again just works your
obliques and then I do these kind of
side plank crunches and I do 15 reps on
each side so basically I just go down
and back up and kind of dipping my hips
down and then I will do 30 reps of these
candlestick stretches on each side of my
body and these really hurt they don't
hurt while you're doing it but the next
day you really feel it in your obliques
Blogilates taught me this move I love it
and then I just finish off with a 1.5
minute plank because I really do think
planks are like one of the best things
to do for your abs and then I do 30
second planks on each side of my body
for my obliques and that is it for my
average team if it's a leg day this is
the routine I'll do it usually takes
about 30 minutes I like to use two and a
half pound ankle weights to make these
harder but I start off by doing 25
lunges on each one of my legs really
making sure that I watch my form and
then I do about 50 reps of these plie
squats with a 10-pound weights and then
I will move on to my lateral leg lifts
and I'll do about 25 reps on each leg
these don't look like they hurt that bad
but they really do put a lot of impact
on your thighs and then I just move on
to your standard squats and I do this
with again a 10-pound weight and I do
about 50 of these
Oh and then I just move on to these calf
raises which I was on uneven ground so I
look really stupid because I couldn't
hold my balance but these really just
work your calves and then I do 20 reps
of these kind of inner thigh leg lifts
which also look kind of funny but they
really do work and then I switch over to
leg circles and I just circle my top leg
and I do about 10 reps going way making
sure to switch directions so I hit all
of the muscle groups and then after this
I just move on to my donkey kicks and I
do about no donkey kicks fire hydrants
and I do about 25 of these on each leg
and then I do these ones where I kind of
do a fire hydrant and then I kick back
and I do 20 reps on each leg and then I
do just my donkey kicks right here with
kind of a straight leg and I do these
for 25 on each leg and then after I do
25 I do a 25 second pulse and trust me
guys this kills me at the end of my
workout it's like the hardest part I'm
always dripping with sweat but really
really good leg workout and I love this
one and then I like to finish off with
just a one-minute little wall sit
because this kind of just finalizes
everything so for my arm routine this is
what I do I'm really new to doing arm
workouts I'm not really used to it so
please no hate this is just what I do I
know I look kind of funny but I start
off by using both six pound weights and
10 pound weights so the orange ones are
six and the grey ones are ten I do 20
reps of just these flyaways with my six
pound weights these are really hard for
me so I know I look kind of funny and
that I do 20 reps of just these V raises
can really feel these in your shoulders
and then I do 20 reps of these ones
where basically I bring in my arms and
then I bring them up into a shoulder
press I really like these these always
feel really good well they don't feel
good but they feel good after and then I
like to do just 20 or 30 reps of these
tricep kickbacks these are pretty
popular you guys have probably seen
these before and then I do 10 reps of
just the shoulder curl down I don't
really know what to call these but yeah
what I'm
I do this with a 10-pound weight and
then I like to do about 20 reps of these
in-and-out curls and then I do ten reps
of these curl ups and then I flicked out
and I go really really slow going down
these ones really hurt but they feel
really good and then I do thirty reps of
just your standard bicep curls these
ones always look like the typical gym
guy you know what I'm saying but and
then I move on to these L raises and I
do about 20 reps on each arm and then I
just do 20 dips which really work your
triceps and they feel really good and
that's it for my arm workout so I really
