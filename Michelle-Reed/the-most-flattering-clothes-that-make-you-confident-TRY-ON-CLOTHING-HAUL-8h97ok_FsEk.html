just clicked on this video you should
stick around I post beauty and fashion
and lifestyle stuff today's video is a
video that I haven't done in a long time
and that is a try on clothing haul it's
winter time in New York City which means
I'm kind of itching for springtime
because I'm so tired of the cold weather
so I decided to order a few things from
one of my favorite companies which is
princess Polly and you guys have
probably heard them a lot and you're
probably like oh my gosh princess Polly
clothes are so cute I ordered about 10
things off the website and I kid you not
all of them look so cute I've never had
a website where everything I just put on
from the company is adorable so I am
literally in love with them I just think
that they're so great and they decided
to give me a discount code for you guys
so if you want to get 20% off you can
use the code love em R and I definitely
recommend it if you want to see how I
style these pieces make sure to follow
me on my Instagram it's not Michelle
Reed also gonna be telling you guys
sizing because I know sizing all
princess Polly is one of those things
that kind of sketchy for people first
thing I got I love really cute plaid
miniskirt as you guys know I have to
wear business casual to college and so I
wear skirts all the time so I'm totally
excited to wear this with like black
tights and a white button-down I'm
honestly gonna wear this I think the
class today it's really simple I got
this in a size 6 because it's Australian
sizes and it fits pretty perfectly the
next thing that I got is another skirt
and I've actually already worn this one
and I just think that it is adorable the
color is something that I don't have a
lot of it's just like this dark green
color and it's really flowy and wavy and
it ties you guys know I love me a good
wrap skirt it's uriel is super cool it's
like this knit material which I just
think is so cute and while this looks
like something that you can only wear in
this summer actually wear this with
tights and it was really cute I got this
in a size 8 I also got this top which is
really simple it's just like a black
crop top with a mock turtleneck on it
and I've just really am always needing
very basic pieces to pair since I do
wear like a lot of scripts and stuff and
so I thought that this would be a nice
addition to have the material is super
stretchy it's really great quality and I
got this in a size
I think that these are so cute I got
these really nice like soft corduroy
dungarees is what I think they'll call
but they're also like short overalls and
I got these to where they were like a
little bit oversized and it is just so
cute I paired this with like a white
button-down underneath and I literally
wore it to class I like made it business
casual it's the brand Motel 2 which is a
really nice brand right on the set a
size extra small still like oversized so
I think if you're any smaller than me I
don't know if I would recommend getting
these because this is still a pretty
oversized zombie and it's an extra I've
been seeing a lot of people wear shorts
with tights and I just think that's such
a cute like winter trend and so I
decided to pick up this pair of shorts
they're just like pinstripe little
shorts they're like a tan color and they
tie at the waist and I think that these
are gonna be really cute with sweater
tights and so I'm really excited to
style these this top is definitely more
of a spring top so I won't be wearing
this for a while but I think it's
adorable it's this really nice material
and it has stars all over it and it
basically like ties across like your
boobs and you tie it but I think that
this with high-waisted jeans and the
summertime is gonna be so cute I don't
have anything that has stars on it so
I'm super excited to style this it's
gonna be so cute and I got this in a
size 8 so this shirt I love but I
wouldn't recommend ordering just because
I'll explain it first but it's like this
really pretty white dainty top you can't
really see it right now but I'll show it
in the trial and it has like these puffy
sleeves it is so cute
however whenever I was buttoning it
first on it's really hard to button and
then second off I was buttoning it and
two of the buttons fell off two of the
buttons and it comes with replacement
buttons but still it only comes with one
and two came off and like I feel like
it's probably going to break even more
so I wouldn't recommend getting this I
think it's a really beautiful shirt I
just wish it was made nicer and I got
this in a size 8 if you're wondering but
yeah it's really sad because it's
actually a really cute
these I'm pretty sure are my favorite
item in this whole video that's because
I don't own anything like these remotely
anything like this these are I am Gia
pants and if you're watching this like
Michelle I can't imagine you ever
wearing I am Gina pants me neither but
guys these are some rockin pants they
have like these little silver details on
them and then they're like velvet and
they're long and they flare out at the
bottom and y'all if you are wanting some
flattering pants to like hit the town in
get these pants they just fit perfectly
and they make your butt look nice and
they are just like good pants and I
really am excited to wear these out
sometime not that I like go out do
anything but still I got these in a size
8 and I think I could have gotten them
in a size 6 they are a little bit long
not on me they fit my legs pretty well
but I have pretty long legs and so just
know that they do run pretty long if you
are someone who has like shorter legs in
a longer torso or something that you
might have to get these heads but it is
worth it because they are some hot pants
the next thing that I got is this place
suit which i think is adorable again
this is definitely something that's
probably more for the summer but it is
this beautiful green color and it has
little buttons and it has short I can
probably wear this with tights and
unlike a sweater and make it cute I
think that this is really awesome it's
this really light linen color which for
the Texas summer times this is gonna be
very nice I got this in a size 6 and it
fits perfectly I think it's meant to be
a little oversized this is definitely a
summer piece but I thought that it was
really beautiful it's this pretty
chartreuse color which if you don't know
chartreuse this color is actually my
favorite color I think it's a really
pretty color and also really exposed
back so if you live in somewhere that's
super hot this will be really really
good and I just think it's really cute I
got this in a size 6 I've recently been
trying to wear more red I think that red
is a really beautiful color and so I got
this dress which is definitely like a
summer dress but it is a halter top and
it has little buttons on it and it's
like a mini-dress it's definitely a very
mini dress so again this is like very
summer I'm not gonna wear this anytime
soon the back is completely exposed
I love open back stuff I just think that
like show not your back is really cute I
got this in a size 8 super flattering
this dress is also super freakin
beautiful it's just like this striped
mini dress it's pretty tight this with
Converse in the summer is gonna be so
cute with some hoop earrings mm guys I'm
feeling it the colors are super cool
it's like a mustard yellow with glue I
got this in a size extra small and I
actually take it back
I think that this dress is tied with the
IMG of pants because it is beautiful I'm
gonna wear this on Valentine's Day I'm
actually gonna put this in a video but
beautiful rose colored dress it is so
flirty it has sleeves that go out and it
ties up the waist and the back is
exposed it's a little low-cut so I'm
gonna kind of alter it I think to bring
it together but I think that this dress
is so pretty if you are going out on a
date you have got to try this dress it
is so pretty and I'm so excited to wear
this for Valentine's Day so those are
all the things I got for princess Polly
I'm serious guys if you want clothes
that are flattering that make you feel
super confident and that are just really
trendy and cute
