video that I'm honestly really excited
to do I got this idea from Keaton
Milburn and one of her recent Q&amp;amp;A is she
mystery man Q&amp;amp;A basically answering
anonymous questions so she asked on
instagram for like an honest question so
people don't say their username just
answering more like personal questions
that I feel like in a normal Q&amp;amp;A you'd
be like too scared to ask if I did that
exact same thing I used asked fo which
literally reminded me of middle school
people were so me on ask FM in middle
school I remember that I used that and
you guys asked like some pretty good
questions and so in today's video I'm
gonna be answering them obviously I'm
being more vulnerable and personal in
this video and with that comes kind of a
risk of not knowing how people are gonna
react how people might like judge you
and I just want to let you guys know if
you're offended by anything I say if you
disagree that's okay this is just a spot
to like discuss and some of you guys
want to know my opinions on things that
are more personal and usually I hold off
from answering them but I wanted this
blog review place where I can answer
truthfully and you guys could like
listen and if you don't agree then you
don't agree that's okay as you guys know
I'm a Christian and I'm pretty strong on
my beliefs so this is gonna be a video
where I'm not gonna like shy away from
answering them because I want you guys
to know how I think so someone asked if
I am planning to stay a virgin until
marriage and I'm actually ready to
answer this question and a video I did
on intimacy a while back I am that is
something that is really important to me
I miss someone where I find like in my
relationships that I have I'm really
ready like to relationships so this is
like something that like I like do all
the time a physical attachment isn't
necessarily there like the relationship
is so much better
I've talked about this in that video but
I just feel more connected with people
when we're not like pertaining and stuff
like that and when we are like hearing
each other and listening to each other
and saving myself for marriage
so maybe I am
like really passionate about and it's
something that I do want to do and I
would always date people who are on the
same page as me people who like agreed
with that and we're okay with that I
would never date someone who was like
disagree with that and I think if you're
ever with someone who is pushing your
physical boundaries that is a
relationship you need to get out because
that shows that that person is going to
push boundaries even beyond physical
thing bushnell boundaries that kinda
stuff I just think that is a red flag of
a person if Thoroughly trying to make he
do things that you don't want to do and
this isn't you then that's okay this
isn't you but for me I just like don't
want to I find that my attachment to
people whatever it's not physical is so
much stronger whenever I'm like learning
about them whenever I am seeking to know
them on like an emotional level that's
not tied to sex that is something that I
feel like is important that's something
that's really special to me and it's
something that I do want to save with a
person who like I'm gonna be with for
the rest of my life I don't think that
if that's not you that you're like dirty
or unwanted or any of those words I know
that's a big thing in the Christian
community where we can shun women who
don't necessarily have that same like
mindset this is just my own personal
belief someone asked if there was
something that I was like physically and
secure about my body and if I do compare
myself to other people with this and I
can definitely say like this is so true
I think you can look at a person that
you think is the most beautiful person
in the world but they still have
insecurities just like you or while a
big insecurity of mine used to be my
hips I have always had really narrow
hips and I remember in high school I
would just like always be so insecure
because my hips would do that dip thing
and they started coming out with like
these workouts or like to get rid of hip
dips and I'm like looking back that is
ridiculous
know why that's even a workout routine
like it's literally your bone structure
that makes you have those dips it's not
because like you have to work off fat
and that's what a whole other thing I
was so insecure about my hips and I
would hate wearing high-waisted jeans I
would hate anything that was essentially
because to me I always wanted these hips
that were like wider and like did it
look so strange like growing up in
college I have just really learned that
like I appreciate my hips and like I
like how my hips are more narrow and
that's not something that bothers me but
I think it just goes to show that your
insecurities that you have whenever
you're younger like do change and there
are fads that like make things in I know
like having like a huge butt right now
is the thing but I feel no pressure to
like be in that category because I'm
like I think my body is fine and I don't
think that those standards a beauty that
lasts for like a month or a year are
like worthy of anything if you're
confident in the way that you look I
feel like that is perfectly fine and I
don't think that like standards of
beauty should like changed up stay sir
your question like I do compare myself
to other people I have I feel like I did
more in high school that was something
that I did a lot more just because it's
like high school is just like a more
like caddy culture I do say that I think
you start comparing yourself to people
in other ways like for me people who are
really like smart people we're really
intelligent you would like look like
they have it all going on like sometimes
that to me is like well I will compare
myself to now and I just have to like
really try not to do that so someone
asks is it weird that I haven't
experienced my grown-up self single I
thought this was an interesting question
because like going into college I had
this mindset that I wanted to like be
single for a while and just really enjoy
my time and
I've learned that no matter if you're
single or in a relationship you can
still enjoy life like for what it is
don't feel like I've ever like missed
out on anything because I've like been
in a relationship I don't think that's
ever a thought that really like comes to
cross me I feel like I still meet
friends I have like a best friend the
person that I'm dating and I couldn't
imagine being in college and like not
dating him right now like I just feel I
could be such a different dynamic I'm
sure it would still be great but he's
just like my best friend and that's
something that I feel like he was there
for a reason and I don't think that like
me being single like I'm sure it would
have been fun I'm sure it would have had
its benefits but I don't think of
something that I feel like I like missed
out on I'm not really the kind of girl
who likes like go out and like party and
have like a really fun time like with us
on a friends and like good truck that's
just not me personally I've never been
that person that makes me really
uncomfortable it's like being around a
ton of people and so you know I feel
like I missed out on anything I'm a very
independent person and whatever I've
been in relationships I've learned how
to like keep that independence despite
being in a relationship I think it's
really important to have your own
hobbies and your own things and your own
friends so you don't lose yourself I
think since I've had that balance I've
been a lot better and it hasn't been
like this sense of missing out online
what are some tangible tips that you and
every boyfriend have for staying pure
until marriage I love this question
because I feel like and like the
Christian community you're always told
like you shouldn't have sex before
you're married you shouldn't do this you
should do X but they don't really tell
you like the in-betweens
and like to be honest like it is a hard
thing it's not something that you just
like naturally happens so like practical
tips we are people who don't necessarily
like to like be alone in the same room
and you'd like to but I just don't I
mean your New York City we're just
always out like walking doing stuff
eating food going places which times can
be frustrating it can be expensive we
would rather not hang out as much and
then like whenever we do hang out we're
out doing stuff with people or with
ourselves we don't spend a lot of time
like sitting around watching movies and
I think that has been a really
important thing because for me
personally I find I enjoy my time better
whenever I am out doing stuff and not
just like sitting at home in a room or
something and also we don't like stay
overnight places together like I got
this opportunity to go on this really
cool ski trip and they told me that this
would be a place where there just be one
bedroom and I had a plus one and so I
wasn't gonna break him because I knew
that would be a source of temptation and
so I think you just have to pick your
battles and while some nights it may
seem like oh we can just like sit and
watch a movie you have to be able to say
like maybe this isn't the best thing and
it takes both people and that's why I
feel like it's really important to date
someone who's on the same track as you
and has the same mindset because if it's
just you trying to do this it can be a
lot more difficult someone asked I've
ever felt used for my social media
following and I don't really think I've
ever felt like used by people I've had
people who I never talked to in high
school who like message maybe like hey
you want to like help me make a youtube
channel and shout out my channel and
that to me makes me really uncomfortable
because first I feel like a lot of the
youtubers you've watched started YouTube
not like trying to make money just as a
hobby and now there's like this stigma
that you can just create a YouTube
channel make a lot of money that's just
not true like it has to be a hobby it
has to be a passion so it felt like
that's the only time I feel like I'm
necessarily being used but I don't think
it's out of bad intentions it's just
people who like see someone who like
they think they grew up with and they're
like oh I'll just like get a shout out
from you and I'm like that's not
respectful that's not nice it's
specially when you've never made an
effort to get to know somebody in high
school like don't ask them for favors
just because they have a youtube channel
that may sound harsh but it's just true
I wouldn't do that even like people that
I know in real life that I'm not really
close with I wouldn't be like hey like
lend me $10 it's the same thing it's not
so I got a lot of questions on my
breakup in this video I'm just gonna be
honest this is something that I don't
want to put on the internet I just don't
want to put details I think that's very
unfair to people and I feel like that's
very unwise to do and so I get a lot a
lot of questions from you guys
about feeling you never talked about
your breakup I feel like you never
really discussed it and I don't feel the
need to I think breakups are something
that are natural and they're different
for each person
I don't think me like sitting here
telling you guys about my breakup it's
gonna help anyone everyone deals with
breakups different and I feel like
whenever I get questions about this it's
less of hey Michelle like I want to know
how you went through your breakup so I
can help like me go through my I think
it's for Michelle I want to know what
happened because I feel like you were
like wrong in this situation I just feel
like there's a finger that's always
being pointed and I don't really feel
the need to answer this question and so
that happened like over a year ago and
that was a face my life that I went
through and now I'm out of at this point
of my life and do I have like regrets of
how I did things yeah I do I mean I tell
myself not to have regrets but there are
definitely things that I wish I didn't
do and that breakup or in that
relationship or I just feel like I was
not the nicest person but you forgive
each other and you apologize and you
move on and that's just life and I think
as you get older you kind of learn how
to do that a little bit better
Scott oh it is so I got a question from
a girl who said she was an atheist and
she's now looking at trying Christianity
again which I want to say I think is
really awesome for me I think that
everyone's individual walks with
Christianity are very different I also
had a question of someone saying if I
ever doubt my faith I never doubt that
like God isn't there I never doubt Jesus
and I'm a doubt that like Jesus isn't
Lord but I do think in every one's
individual faiths like there is a sense
of doubt and that's always there and it
kind of pulls you further into wanting
to learn I think it said of doubt being
this thing that like turns you away from
God for me it's something that like
pushes me to actually read my Bible I'll
be like okay yeah I do think like why
would Jesus teach this whenever he
teaches this so I go into my Bible and I
like work and I pray to figure out that
doubt so for me I think of doubt less of
something that like polarizes me from
religion but it's something that like
makes me want to pursue it because I'm
like I know that this is right and I
know has brought me to be the person
that I am so I'm gonna work and put in
that work to actually like try to pursue
it I think having that sense of
curiosity about Christianity is really
important and something that's hard and
also something that goes away like not
everyone wants to sit down or feed their
Brightwell every day a really great
place to start you've probably heard
this a lot is John John talks a lot
about Jesus specifically and if you're
confused about Jesus and you're like I
don't really know this Jesus guy is John
is a really good book John also has like
a high Christology of Jesus and Jesus is
this divine figure and I'm something
that whenever you learn about the
Gospels they all write very differently
like Philippians writes about Jesus as
this person who was suffering you as a
servant who really poured himself into
people and he was someone it was kind of
down and adapts with the people who were
kind of rejected by society so
prostitutes people who were sick or as
John kind of portrays Jesus as this more
divine figure but I think John is a
really good place to start and then
going through the rest of the gospel
there's some really good resources
online if you want to understand the
books I'll have a few link down below I
think online sermons are also really
good I personally really love listening
to Matt Chandler's online sermons I
think he's a really good teacher and for
someone who is a new Christian he's a
very captivating speaker and it just
makes sense and so I think he's a really
good place to start of course I would
always recommend going to a church I
think church is something that really
just opens your eyes and there's just
something very different about being in
a community of people I think going to
church every Sunday for me personally
it's really important is I just feel
like okay these are the people who have
the same faith as me these are the
people who believe Jesus is the same
person that I believe it to be and so I
want to be around these people every
Sunday I want to worship with them and I
want to feel community I want to take
communion I want to praise Jesus in a
public setting and so for me church is
really important I know a lot of people
don't go to church especially in college
but it just centers me and I think it's
really important and if you can finding
a community group is also really good
most churches have like Bible study
groups that sound kind of scary but
they're less scary and more just like
people chatting about the Bible I think
being known by other people is really
important in a Christian community and
that's something that it's kind of hard
for me personally groups aren't
something that comes like easily so I
think I answered quite
questions in this Q&amp;amp;A so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video make sure to follow
me on Instagram because it might do one
of these again if you guys liked how he
did this one also if you liked the
anonymous like questions let me know if
you have any thoughts leave it down
below I would love this to be like a
discussion based video I think that
that's really important so I love you
guys and I'll see you guys my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
