today's video which is going to be ten
facts about Starbucks that you hopefully
didn't know so if you do know any of
these and I apologize I'm going to try
and make them as obscure as possible
also these facts are going to be really
simple and they're not going to be
extremely detailed it's just kind of a
light-hearted fun video that I hope you
will like the first five is the original
mermaid on the Starbucks logo was not as
PG rated as it is today because let's
just say the care was not covering up
all of her bibs and I really I really
wanted to picture like here of what it
was in 1992 however I don't think that I
can because I really don't want this
video to get your positive community so
I might just leave that with you want to
see how try and include a link in the
description below so if they've
interested you can go and click where
this next fact I found astonishing and
it is all about Starbucks drinks and the
different combinations there are 87
thousand possible combinations of drink
that you can get from Starbucks this
means if you went to Starbucks twice a
day for the rest of your life and each
day and with each drink you tried a
different combination of flavors
you would not be able to try out all the
combinations unless you live to be about
119 years old
I'm sharps on line one
the location of a Starbucks in Zurich
Switzerland I don't know if I'm
pronouncing that right as rich they have
a Starbucks place there that is
basically a refurbished train so it's
got the Starbucks hold on the outside
but when you go in it's really really in
modern and slowly ending it's kind of
like a beige interior it's absolutely
gorgeous
- boy it's at Starbucks in very select
rare locations actually offered beer
wine and an evening meal a range of
evening meals gonna have truffle
macaroni and goats cheese with wine and
beer and artichoke and a lot more food
than that like that is also the place I
would like to go because I've never seen
in startups and adventurous before they
just sell kind of lattes community I'm
not familiar with this cup because I'm
not overly and familiar with these
Starbucks drinks well I bet they do 8
wrentham look cook and if you know what
the trend to cook is then you'll know
what I'm talking about I'll have a
picture here anyway if you don't like me
I do know now what I think before and if
this trend Club which is a huge huge
form multiple liquid then the human
stomach which technically means you
couldn't drink it in one go unless you
make yourself throw up and seriously ill
and the cup contains @ 30.9 ounces of
liquid when it
let me know I ask an option for a cup
then if you find that all the kind of
normal cup sizes at Starbucks are too
big for you and you just need to like a
quick buzz then you can actually ask for
an 8 ounce cup which is basically a kid
sized cup and it's just perfect if you
want like a quick coffee puts in the
morning to wake you up perfect that but
you'll probably know what I mean because
it will sound you having a laugh they've
done this is like if those times done
that now the third time is really really
annoying it takes ages to get up and use
that nerds rehabilitate you as well
stop Walton wait
well let's talk about the grande sighs
coffee Starbucks but this grande or
grande size coffee at Starbucks contains
more caffeine than four red balls after
one I've never had a grande grande size
coffee before but I know that after one
Red Bull I'm off the wall I'm crazy I
just I haven't really really I'm very
sensitive to sugar and caffeine and
things of that sort
so for for Red Bulls I would be on the
floor paralyzed this one I found very
interesting in late 2013
Starbucks sold Premium Gold cards which
contained actual gold in them they cost
four hundred and fifty dollars and as
stupid as that prize may seem they sold
out within minutes because people just
like Starbucks alarm I thought this fact
was relevant the students is autumn
right now or they pumpkin spice latte at
Starbucks is by far the most popular
drink that they have and it has its own
Twitter account with nearly 83 thousand
followers and it's not very five-year
well no doubt it will be sometime in the
near future
any final facts I have for you is that
Starbucks has employed or is currently
employing
over 137 thousand employees across the
world I want you to take ten thousand
that is crazy and this was in 2010 and
judging by the fact that Starbucks
increases by two stores or on average
about two point five stores in each day
it's safe to say that there will be a
lot more employees now and also 137,000
is twice the population of Greenland
so yeah no words I hope you enjoyed this
video guys have a beautiful day and
don't get stay positive
bye guys subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
