part two of a series I guess you could
say of videos I have on my channel
called genie scaly inventions that you
probably didn't know existed you all
seem to absolutely love part 1 of this
video that I will have linked below if
you want to go and watch that so I
thought why not come out with a part 2
don't forget that if you enjoy what
you're watching please give this video a
thumbs up and press that subscribe
button because if you end up you enjoy
it I will try my best to come out with
the part 3 ah I'm going to start off
with my favorite for the first one it is
called a Sun pot now apparently these
were a thing in the 1980s but it's
basically your own soap capsule to
sunbathe in not only that but you can
fill the base of it with a small amount
of water to like dip yourself in to keep
yourself cool while stocking up the Sun
and you also have windows on the side of
this pod to keep yourself cool and stop
it from getting too hot in there and
also the pod is apparently soundproof
which one is great because you can't
hear annoying little kids that are
having a good time that just no year and
number two it will probably stop people
from talking to you which is definitely
not a bad thing because when I'm
sunbathing and people try and start a
conversation with me and they get real
deep like how do you think the world
came into existence I'm just like can
you please stop like talk to me about it
some other time
not when I'm trying to get myself some
UV rays will you shut the hell up ha
whoever invented this next one is an
absolute genius it's a base to put on
the heel of your shoe which increases
the surface area which means that when
you want to take a picture out on the
garden you won't sink into the grass
also all these seams we made them pretty
cheap plastic which definitely isn't an
issue because it means that it will be a
lot cheaper to buy so literally like 99p
or $1 for these heal bases this one has
apparently been invented by Beyonce's
stylist
this isn't an amazingly weird invention
or anything but it's a case that goes
around your phone that lights up and
kind of works hand-in-hand with the
front camera to give you the most
perfect selfie lighting that you could
wish for this next one is the weirdest
thing that you will probably see today
but hey that's non-issue it's a goal
girl female urination device that is
$9.99 from Target possibly aster as well
if you're in the UK basically you know
when you're going on really long car
journeys and you really need a weave
there's no toilet so you can find like
public toilets so you have to kind of go
in a bush somewhere just me okay well
for guys it's really easy because you
just kind of a met for a bush or just a
male way to learn an abortion it just
perfect aim the girls is extremely
difficult but with this device you win
to end it gives you a perfect and direct
stream of weight so you don't get it
everywhere now the picture that I'm
showing you right now you can obviously
see that the shoes not very nice it's
just got a random pink strip down it run
so you can get all black shoes it just
look very sleek and elegant but when
your feet start hurting just clip the
heel into the sole of the shoe and you
will have yourself some flat shoes that
your feet will thank you for number four
is a kind of more serious invention but
it's still genius either way and it's
probably the most helpful device that
I'm going to tell you about today I'm
sure you're all aware of date rape drugs
that people can put in like women's
drinks for college students from North
Carolina State University developed a
nail polish that cannot detect date rape
drugs in the drink so basically if you
do leave your drink or knock you pied
don't ever do that when you come back
you can stir your finger around in a
drink really casually just simply
stirring up your cocktail or whatever
and if it does have any kind of drugs in
it then your nail polish will change
color and it stays in this picture it
will change from pink to black back to a
more lighthearted one you know how you
want to shave your legs in the shower
and your what you like my put your feet
on the inside of the bath if your
showers like a bath and showering one
and then it just slips off well this is
a
the suction cup shower footrest such a
simple invention but so useful it's
basically you can just destruction you
just put it onto a side of the shower
but you find out and you can just easily
shave your legs next spray paint nail
polish so simple yet quite genius last
year there's a trend on YouTube where
people with testing Alvis product and
for the majority people had good reviews
for it but others who will just lay it
on to the point in their which to be
fair it might be quite pointless but it
is quite a genius idea but it's
basically spray paint nail polish so you
just spray paint the nails with the
color of your choice and then this two
different versions number one you remove
the excess with nail polish remover or
number two you just peel it off I think
sticker might develop this product and
you might have heard of it
it's a device you can use to clean your
makeup brushes and oh my god I don't
have anything to clean my makeup brushes
right now with so I just use plain water
and then like Devon want a towel of some
sort which probably isn't the best thing
to do but I need this if they're you
admit that you put on your hand and
after you wash your makeup brushes in
the damp you can scrub them on this myth
that has kind of is textured mitt so it
really gets into your brush and really
thoroughly cleans it and there's
different versions you can get a mitt or
a base to put on your sink so you can
just swipe your bushes on it that way
finally if you are a tourist that enjoys
going to different destinations often
maybe you travel in the world this might
be for you or if you live in a hot
country and you like sunbathing it's a
tanning pillow so you know when you go
to spas and you get a massage you put
your face down there's like a hole for
your face so that it's not squashed
against the surface well this is a
similar idea awareness it's a pillow
that you can put your face on but
there's a hole here so that you don't
squash your face also it's great storage
and I really sucked away the storage
because you can peel back the pillow and
you've got nice little compartments to
store some tanning lotion bone keys I
have now covered all of the genius
inventions I really hope you enjoyed
this video if you were startled or like
even one of these inventions please give
this video a thumbs up and also leave
your thoughts in the comment section
below because I love to hear any
requests you might have for a future
video or what you thought of this one
I'm gonna go and eat now because I
haven't even had breakfast and it's half
past two have a beautiful day and don't
get stay positive bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
