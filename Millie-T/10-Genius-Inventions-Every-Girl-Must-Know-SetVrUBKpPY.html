is going to be girly inventions that you
probably didn't know existed if as you
are watching this video you enjoy what
you see please subscribe because I have
just hit 40,000 subscribers so we are so
close to 50,000 as well and that is
unbelievable I'm really excited so
please help me out there onto the girly
hacks enjoy number one is a hair tie
bracelet I saw this and literally
thought was genius and I didn't know why
I hadn't thought of it before it's a
bracelet with like a gap that you can
insert your bubbling to all the way
around your wrist and it doesn't leave a
red mark I was working at a preschool
last week and the amount of children
that came in with bubbles around the
wrists was incredible we had to take off
so many bubbles and when he took them
off there was a huge red mark so I was
like that can't be good
so that is a genius invention that I'm
need to find next it's probably one of
my favorites it's basically a
customizable high heeled shoe so you
have a shoe and the heel on it you can
screw off I insert ones of different
lengths so in the box service one of
this length this length this length and
then like this length they just go all
the way up until they're like stiletto
heels I need to find one of those I want
one
next isn't necessarily for girls this
one could be for guys as well so that
there are any guys watching then hello
you could buy this one as well
it's basically a duck and eggs speaker
so if you have an egg and you plug the
egg into your phone and you can play
music this that's a rubber duck that has
a speak on and it's obviously waterproof
this door can go in your bath and it'll
just play music as its swimming around
with you I'm floating around not
swimming
good dog swim
yeah you defeat passionately next is
liquid latex nail polish now let me
explain because it might sound a bit
weird but basically you know late text
books you are for washing up you can get
it in nail polish form instead of
painting your actual nail you paint
around your nail and the excess nail
polish that goes around your nail will
just land on the liquid latex and you
can just peel it off and your nail art
will be in perfect condition with no
excess got on your skin it's all come
off with your liquid latex now there's a
pretty good idea I don't know about
anyone else but for me I always drop
nail polishes or I'll knock them over
the main way that I do this is that I
think that the lids on all the way but
it's not so I'll pick it up by the lid
and then it'll like it'll pick it up
somewhat quite far away and then it'll
just drop off and then the pot will
smash nail polish will go everywhere
stained furniture not grave but you can
get a nail polish stand and you just
clip your nail polish into the hole and
then it prevents any spillages and also
this nail polish stand you insert your
nail polish into it and then it will
tilt to how much you want so if you want
to get the very last drop of nail polish
you can tilt it quite a bit but and it
also prevents any spillage it's like
that because it's basically attached
very firmly to this stand in our
graveyard girl did a does the same
really work what was that she well as
you did that video anyway on a makeup
brush cleaner with this machine you can
just insert all of your makeup bushes I
think it holds six to twelve and then
you just turn it on and it has two
15-minute intervals where it will clean
your bushes for you I haven't heard of
any of the makeup brush cleaners which
is quite sad because we need more of
them girls just don't have the effort to
clean another one to do a nail polish is
nail polish rings so it's a brands nail
polish and instead of having to put the
nail polish down on a desk it's got two
holes like a ring and then you can just
paint your nails
easily without same hand like take so
half and then paint it here I'd like to
say that this prevents villagers however
if you forget it's on their name just
score to like scratch it out of
something like that it's just going to
go everywhere so this won't be something
that I'll be purchasing again this isn't
necessarily for girls but I had to
destroy it in there a knife designed
full of teller drawers so you can get
every last drop out it's a normal
butcher knife you just have to I just
use my finger normally and I'll just eat
Nutella as it is but if you want
actually put it on bread it's impossible
to get out if it's under like the lid
but with this one it's got just the
right curve that you can get all the way
around the jar that now that's something
I'll be buying this one as well right my
hairbrush now and you see the amount of
hair in that I bought it's really easy
to get out cuz all you have to do is
that and literally it's clean now that's
my hair ladies and gentlemen you're
welcome but for an even easier way to
clean out your hairbrush is to buy a
specially designed one where the base
just rips off along with the face
welcome your hair so it's just a really
easy way to take off any hand that you
don't want in there and basically I have
two bushes at the exact same because I
thought that I'd lost this one so I
bought this one and then I found this
one and I still have this one one more
time for the magic let's go clean
technology and finally a ben jerry's ice
cream lock or any ice cream lock but the
example here is a Ben &amp;amp; Jerry's ice
cream and you just placing lock around
the top and you set a cold and it
prevents anyone from stealing your ice
cream stepbrothers by the way what's
your favorite flavor of Ben and Jerry's
ice cream so for me whilst cookie dough
ice cream but then I had the brown one
and oh my god the brown one is
it's so chocolatey and I really like the
look to McFlurry so you can get at
McDonald's where you get wait I can have
my crunchy ice cream with extra
chocolate sauce in it and that's
basically the Bello gyrus brownies just
got loads of chocolate sauce to it and
brownies then they see it for today's
video guys I really hope that you
enjoyed it let me know in the comments

point and if you are that is amazing
