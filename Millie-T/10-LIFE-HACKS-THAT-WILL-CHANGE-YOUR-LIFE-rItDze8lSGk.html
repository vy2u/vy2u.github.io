Lee and welcome to today's video which
is life hacks and I think this is part
four and then kind of series I've had
going on on my channel for a while now
I've have done beauty hacks and then
just like hacks in general so this is
life hacks in general all ages and all
genders so I hope that you enjoy it I'm
not a huge fan of really long
interruptions so I'm going to get on
with the life hacks and I hope that you
enjoy it
don't forget to leave a comment thumbs
up this video and maybe even subscribe
if you like what you see so I'm gonna
get on the video now number one is to do
with NASA so basically NASA will pay
anyone around fifteen thousand dollars
if they are willing to sit in a bed for
eight to seven days and it's all to do
with NASA's research in zero-gravity and
the effects of it so if you are willing
to sit in the event of age seven days
and do nothing maybe like only fold
listen to music whatever you want to do
in that time as long as you stay in bed
go for it sign up get yourself fifteen
thousand dollars there are a lot of
different like prices I have looked up
online like there are so so so many
different sources that say different
prices that they pay you but if you are
genuinely interested you might have to
do some deep digging online see what you
can find to get like the best possible
sound on your iTunes replicate these
presets on the equalizer so they'll
appear on this picture here on the
screen and if you're gonna equalize on
iTunes and you just copy them and
replicate them you will get amazing
sound for your music and to be fair as
into music so so much so if you listen
to as much as I do
you will be so thankful for this like
that because I was I still am right I'm
quite an evil person so I thought this
thing quite well with my personality but
if you are stuck with someone who snores
a lot like maybe a roommate and you like
can't get Cynthia snoring so so loud get
a few jobs over vinegar and like put it
on their bottom lip and it fit on that
tongue and because vinegar is like quite
strong it will force them to close their
mouth to get rid of the taste to like
wash it down with this live--i
so when they close their mouth they'll
have to breathe through the nose and you
can't really sing all that way so I hope
this one helps you and if you're an evil
person and enjoy pranking people then it
fit in really well now summer okay hello
just say something really quickly I
really really want to make the most of
summer like it is so bad because I look
back on the last summer and I can't
remember anything that I did
apart from go on holiday just my
memories like blank from last summer and
that is so depressing cuz it was like
well I wouldn't do anything that great
so I've been trying to get out more this
summer but I realized that I can't do
much I can't drive I'm really trying to
find ways to live life to the fullest
right now but when you can't drive it so
difficult so sorry about that right next
life hike is a summer idea I don't know
why I never thought of this earlier oh
but I could get it off online but I
don't know why I didn't think of this
and you can actually get like what guns
like get cheap one seven pound lenders
dollars tree fill it with paints like
different colored paints and that's like
ten water guns and then um you can kind
of do a Hunger Games like put them in a
pile in the middle you garden on middle
of like this huge field that you're on
everyone runs pick super walk on and
then just shoot each other with it and
that's like a paintball fight without
pain and the bruises and the cuts
swelling oh and when you do it you have
to wear white clothing as well so you
can see all the effects so if you have a
friend whose dog might have died or
maybe family member who do stop by his
dad if you don't still alive and well
visit shelter pups calm send a picture
of your dog or your friends doggy mom's
dog or your artist on your grandma's dog
and they will make a stuffed animal
version of it and send it to you and I
just how that was such an iSight kinda
memory or like keepsake of your pet it's
a really good idea like if I was to
start a business
everything to do with making stuffed
animals for pets not taxidermy though ok
so say for example your child is having
like a fairy tale birthday party or you
just genuinely want you know like a
really nice
Wonderland kind of garden and you have a
pathway and if that pathway has rocks
paint all the rocks with a paint called
restore Liam glow and this paint
basically
is charged by the sunlight and then at
night it glows so you get a kind of
fantasy glow in the dark a pathway
leading up to your house it looks really
magical ok so just with the record I
have tried this one before
and it works like a lot so it's like
when ordering an ice cream instead of
saying to the person can I have two
scoops of this ice cream please ask for
one scoop or when they were just about
to hand it to you go oh no sorry
am I ready to have two scoops is that
okay and then they'll get into the one
and your ice cream will be so much more
bigger because when you ask for two
scoops they'll give you like two quite
small scoops just so they don't really
lose out an ice cream but if you got
auto chemin two scoops sorry they'll be
forced to I've had already put one big
scoop on and then just put another scoop
on some of that so it ends up being like
a huge ice cream great if you want to
prank your friends this is such a good
idea I'm not trying it myself so I doubt
if it works but I don't see why it
wouldn't work and freeze Mentos inside
ice cubes and if the ice cubes ass cubes
if the ice cubes are freeze like
properly for quite a while they will
turn like a kind of translucent or like
opaque why it's still that you can't see
inside them anyway once the water is
frozen with the mentors inside it or the
mints inside it you can then put them in
a glass of coke serve it to your friend
and it will be a time bomb like
explosion
so basically when the ice melts the
Mentos will be in the coke and you know
the whole reaction that you probably
didn't like practice for elementary
school it basically explodes everywhere
so if you want to prank your friends and
do it but make sure you're outside not
like in your room because then the kind
of jokes on you if you get sore will be
bed so do it outside so you know on your
vacuum cleaner you have the kind of
nozzle that's quite a thin tube that you
can be used to get into like all the
nooks and crannies of like stairs and
stuff like that well if you want to get
a more precise suck on the vacuum and
you can put a squeeze to catch your
bottle top over the nozzle unlike a shop
vac it works best but I think you can
get those in America if you put a
squeezy ketchup bottle top on it it
works to kind clean up you know like a
keyboard like phone microphone
or any other like small spaces that
you'll need to clean it just works
really well for that compelled last one
it's a pretty stupid but if you're not
like easily win and you're staring
contest then instead of just like
looking at the person and bursting out
laughing oh my god when I'm into doing
competitions I like I'll just look at
the person I'll go I'll start laughing
matching girls I don't I have a really
weird chin so instead of just look at it
the man burst out laughing how you
normally do look at them and then just
slowly lean in for a kiss so let's
pretend win a staring contest right now
okay right we're gonna stay in contact
and if by then they haven't liked fact
we're gone okay okay you win then they
probably want to kiss you and things
will get really awkward but for the most
part they will go like okay thank you
Ben take it because it's gonna get
really awkward for them and deep down
you know that they're gonna like back
away or whatever
okay so babies in today's video for the
life hacks I really hope you found them
helpful and you will use them in your
day to day life if you enjoy it give it
a thumbs up subscribe comment do
whatever you want have a beautiful day
and don't forget stay positive bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
