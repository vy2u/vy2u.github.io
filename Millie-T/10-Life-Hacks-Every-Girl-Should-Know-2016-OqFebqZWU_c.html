hello everyone its Mellie welcome to
some more girly life hacks number one is
all to do with our iPhone and how to
make your music automatically stop
playing after a certain amount of time
first go on the clock app on your phone
and the time section then decide on an
amount of time and press when timer ends
scroll down and select stop playing this
is a great way to still listen to your
music as you are going to sleep without
worry of your phone overheating or
losing charge number two shows you a way
on how to make foundation lighter if you
have accidentally bought one that is a
shade or five to dark think I have now
finished creating a thumbnail for this
video and I don't really know what to
say if you've ever been in a kind of
similar situation to me get some primer
makeup base or moisturizing cream and
mix it I did a three to one ratio with
your dark foundation mix it around with
your makeup brush and it should be a
more exact match so I improvement I'm
gonna have to say the great art of
contouring now made easier using a spoon
you probably will have seen this hack
before but just in case you haven't I've
just thrown it in there because I can
honestly say that I use this every day
it gives you a much more nicer curve to
your contour and makes it look a lot
more natural so I definitely definitely
recommend it if you feel like your
lipstick isn't pigmented enough simply
use some concealer or foundation on your
lips and then when you apply your
lipstick it will stand out a lot more
also quick side note if you are enjoying
this video so far please press that
subscribe button we are so close to
50,000 subscribers what
if this one product that every girl
needs is definitely coconut oil and it
even stays on the packaging to where it
get some on your finger and begin
applying it to your eyelashes it will
help them grow a lot stronger and faster
and on your brows to make them a lot
more fuller looking I guess you could
also use coconut oil as a hair mask to
get longer and more healthy hair number
six we have another iPhone a hat I will
have to do a separate video with lots of
iPhone hacks on it I hope you will want
that video because it's going to be made
I have had this Miller's cookies card
for the longest time and I'm available
to have a free drink but I keep
forgetting all the time when I go near
there if you have the same issue to fix
this go to the reminders app on your
phone and create a new section then type
in what your gift cards name is so I
just put mine as Millie's cookies and
then you will see an option to turn on
remind me at location then type in the
location select it and when you arrive
that location your GPS will notice and
it will notify you of your gift card if
you travel a lot then when you take your
jewelry places you probably know how
frustrating it is when your necklaces
get really tangled this will hopefully
fix a problem it has done for me anyway
on clasp the necklace and grab a straw
thread one side of the necklace through
the straw until it pops out through the
end then we clasp it and pop it in your
suitcase or bag and it will not tangle
at all
Oh Lord I swear flyaways will be these
death of me when I put my hair up to fix
this issue grab hairspray and a
toothbrush spray the hairspray onto the
toothbrush and just comb your hair or
calm the flyaways into your hair as
normal and the hairspray will allow your
head to just stay in place and for these
flyaways to be gone around two years ago
I always used to conceal my eyes by
dotting it under my eye like that and it
didn't even do anything at all even
conceal anything so instead bring it
down into a triangle kind of formation
under your eyes and this will conceal
and brighten your under eyes making you
look a lot more awake my foundation is
currently at that extremely annoying
stage where there is some product left
in there but not enough for the pump to
pump it out I took the lid off and
grabbed a small foundation brush / a
flat eyeshadow brush got that in the pot
and began scraping at the edges and I
was amazed by how much product there was
actually left this is great for getting
your money's worth out of a product we
have completed all of the life hacks I
hope that you enjoyed this video if you
did give it a thumbs up possibly
subscribe and even go and watch part one
if you want to see more have a beautiful
day and don't forget to stay positive
