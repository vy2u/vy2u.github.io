life hacks video in a very long time but
today I'm back with the life hacks video
and this one is going to be snapchat
life hacks because I love snapchat I
research tags and I noticed that I liked
a lot of them so I thought why not share
them with you guys that's what I've done
yeah enjoy and by the way because I've
done quite a few life hacks videos on
YouTube I have put them all into one
playlists you can go and watch that
playlist if you want link will be in the
description and also you can find it on
my channel and also since this is a bout
snapchat add me if you want its major
such a I snapchat quite a lot hack
number one is one that I always use I've
been using for a very long time and this
one is how to open a message without
actually opening a message so basically
when you get a message on snapchat only
blue text if you go on to the message
and you swipe but don't lift your finger
off you can kind of read it and you or
you'll be able to read it all but then
if you don't want to open it and you
don't and to know that you've opened it
just casually swipe it back and then
won't say that you've opened it and it
won't tell them that you've opened it
we've actually read it
sneaky forget on to hack number two I
just want to thank / give a shout out to
free farm to full kindly sponsoring this
video now yes this is a sponsored video
however I do not sponsor any other
products I think in the four years that
I've been on YouTube I've done three for
sponsorships at most and involving apps
because I really really really like apps
and this one is a farm up so you
basically have a farm you develop your
farm and try and create it into this
idealistic
countryside Haven I'm currently on the
road to doing that I'm basically the
thing that I like most about this app is
that there's always something to do I
can either complete quests that people
give me I can do like get a book
delivery sorted because one of the tasks
that I've got is I've got to go and
visit five friends farms and like help
them clean up the farm and catch these
moles I don't have five friends I have
one which is an automated French story
of my life
and so if you want to add me on that and
I will add you back or comment username
in the comment section so I can add you
back and then I can help you clean moles
out of your farm it's a pretty good app
pretty darn good app I do really I'm
really obsessed with apps it's a problem
okay number two you might know about
this one if you do I apologize and if
you know about any of these hacks
I apologize please don't comment I know
every single one of these apps
congratulations I applaud you his medal
and good happen of it hack number two is
when you take a picture on snapchat and
you can put a filter over in a limited
amount of filter colored filter
so once you've taken the picture go on
to and the option where you can get an
emoji like that square next to the text
symbol and and whenever cool you might
want it someone in you doing watermelon
emoji drag that emoji to the corner of
your screen and keep pinching and
zooming on it like that on your screen
and keep dragging it down to the corner
and make it zoom in so far and you get
like a kind of a pink effect pink filter
this one is creating your own GL filter
so you know when you go to a new
location you might go to London you can
go you can take a picture and when you
swipe on the kind of filter / effects
section it will come up with like London
at the bottom and like an emulsion kind
of a time or a location stamp well up
mmm ah you know what I burped in so many
man videos and everyone always comments
like else disgusting and someone
commented like such a well percenter
beautiful young lady with such vile
habit sounds like if your great your own
geofilter if you go to a website which
I'll have linked in the description
below you can create a mangia filter so
if you are having a party like next
month and you want to have people be
able to take snapshot of it and then
swipe and have their own geofilter and
that might say saying Millie's party or
whatever I felt mildly cold and then you
can eat dust coughs it is a small fee
but you can design it and everything
like that pretty sure you can design it
yourself and then send it off to
snapchat and then will review it or they
promise to review
within one business day and then it will
be all on snapchat at that location at
that specific time and place so yeah
it's pretty and that was pretty cool I
don't know anyone could to have one but
they can this one is an actual hack so
if you go onto settings on your phone go
on to accessibility up on to general
then go on to accessibility gone to zoom
turn zoom on you should get like your
little box on your screen which zooms
everything in then click off settings go
on to snapchat take a picture and then
once you've taken that picture and you
can basically draw on it really detailed
and you can be a lot more specific in
the areas that you want to draw on and
yeah you can create really really pretty
drawings with it next one is the ability
to record without actual touch so if you
want to record video but don't want to
have to like press and hold need to want
to press it once and they'll record and
you can't do that again it's an
accessibility hack so if you go into
settings go on to accessibility again
and then scroll down and go on to an
assistive touch turn assistive touch on
and create a new gesture then when you
come on to this screen press and hold
the screen until the time bar at the
bottom maxes out and then save it and
label it like snap or snapchat or a full
stop or an emoji whatever you wanted to
record then you should get that kind of
assistive torture tools circle in a
square grid box on your screen and then
gone to snapchat click on that assistive
touch box once your custom snapchat and
then all you need to do is press the
record button once tap it and then it
will record for the full time so press
it once and now as you can see I don't
if you can I am recording without
touching anything and it's pretty darn
cool here in Louboutin nails if you want
a cheeky closeup of them the pretty cool
I apologize miss x1 and all a lot people
will know it but I feel like it's quite
important to know if you don't already
know it if you do I apologize go on to
snapchat and you can change your friend
emojis so if you've gone such app swipe
up bonds with Settings manage
preferences friend emoji and you want to
say change you know how these streets
emoji is usually a fire symbol you can
change that so I change mine to some
footsteps number seven you can unlock
every single snapchat trophy in the
trophy cabinet potentially if you go
online and type in a list of snapchat
trophies to unlock it will tell you
everything you need to do to unlock each
trophy that is interesting I think I
haven't actually used it but I'm mine I
won't I not really care that much but if
you care good on you I will have the
website and that will tell you what each
trophy doesn't each cabinet in the
description below and I'm not a lot of
people know about this and I feel like
it's underrated and you can create a
story on your memories so if you've gone
to memories on snapchat and swipe up
Ganta memories and go onto camera roll
or for example I was in London the other
week so when I while I was at lunch and
I took a lot of pictures and I want to
create that into one story in my
memories so I press on the select symbol
select all of my London snaps that I
talked press on that little circle and
plus sign at the bottom of the screen
and create your own story and it's just
nice as a way to organize your life my
life on snapchat is very organized I
want it because my actual life is not
this one I love this one and it's a holy
grail for me if you want to last hard to
explain so you take a picture on
snapchat and a new put a caption and you
can press a text box thing and you can
press the text emoji top right of the
screen and it will change the formation
of your caption make it white bold text
and you can tag take any little send to
the white bulb text when is that white
bold text select it so it's in like an
edit mode and then do that we think is a
pinch the screen in like that do that on
the screen and you can fit all of your
white text on to one line next one last
one you can so if you want to send us
snapchat this seems like such like a I
can't think of another last tag so I
just throw this one in that it wasn't I
actually this was gonna be the first one
but I thought you know what I'm going to
save it best to last in my opinion so if
you want snap chain late at night and a
cute character we know you want to reply
but sudo creme time and you've got no
makeup on and your hairs in a like towel
turbo is that offensive no and you want
to avoid sending them pictures of your
like your shoulder or a wall then gone
Google Images save a picture of a
celebrity that might look like you with
makeup on save it and then face what
with it and send him that and you're
gonna be like Danny look you what makeup
is that just kind of like Google Images
and yeah again download free font too if
you want a nice little app to entertain
yourself when you are on a long cold
journey like I was on the way to London
yeah download it and add me as a friend
because I'm only on it
oh yeah have a brutal day don't really
say positive and she also saw just so
much 100,000 subscribers I cannot even
explain or put into words how much that
means I just I've got a whole video
coming out dedicated to it I hope you'll
enjoy that have a beautiful day don't
get Steve Austin hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
