vital thing to me for losing weight
maybe if you're going for a run on maybe
even joining a gym is to make yourself a
playlist now it might even be on Spotify
or you can don't download it on iTunes
or whatever but you just need to make
yourself a playlist of upbeat songs like
maybe all of me by John Legend the song
like that probably won't be too much
help during exercise it might slow you
down if you're using it for running
however if you are using one like maybe
a dubstep song so when I exercise I do
enjoy listening to Skrillex songs now
it's probably bangarang and scary
monsters and nice sprites are my
favorite songs to kind of get me pumped
up for working out and stuff like that
but you can go for remixes as well so if
you do have a favorite song so for
example if all of me by John Legend is
your favorite song all you need to do is
go to youtube look for a remix and it
will have that song but it will be kind
of altered and half will have a really
good T in the back tip number two is
quite an obvious one but when you're at
the gym if you want to lose weight then
try and stay away from all the weights
now you do need to candy use weights a
little bit just to kind of equally
proportion out what parts you body
working out so maybe if you're running
that would be your legs then you'll need
to do your arms as well otherwise it's
gonna be not in proportion at all it's
gonna look quite strange but I'm talking
about if you are doing a lot of weights
like heavy you know hardcore ways and
stuff like that and one pound of muscle
weighs the same as one pound of fat and
maybe even more so if you want to lose
weight heavy weight lifting and
bodybuilding probably it's not the way
to go about it - number three is one of
my favorites because it doesn't involve
working out and doesn't involve eating
healthily so I hope you like this one in
it's not a big impact one but it does
help a little bit and it is eating spicy
foods if your boyfriend Indian don't get
a coma get a really spicy curry because
spices use contain something called cup
icing which increases the metabolism and
just will help you with burn a lot more
calories
number four for all you girls out there
that have quite long hair when you get
out the shower when you blow-dry your
hair if you do that to 30 minutes and go
really carefully you will burn 100
calories so that's like a bag of crisps
so that's pretty good it's pretty good
number five again one of my favorites is
to drink water before a meal now I have
the I think it's like go blenders and
like that is screen anyway and they like
blending container is like a drinks
bottle as well so it's just really easy
to clean and everything like that that's
800 milliliters so I feel that with ice
cold water drink it and then my tea
comes I won't eat as much now I don't
want you to talk because I know people
get really like a defensive in the
comments or whatever when I'm saying
that I want to lose weight I'm not
talking about me thinking that I'm
really fat or anything I'm just talking
about like toning up my body and just
trying to eat more healthier because I
tend my mom tends to serve quite big
portions for tea and I don't I will end
up eating it because I really like food
so when I have the water before that it
just helps me kinder control how much I
eat number six don't do to me if it
doesn't work or if it's tiring for you I
read it off take a break magazine okay
it's like in real life magazine that I
refined really interesting to read it is
getting a bicycle machine or a spinning
machine and buying one of those now they
are quite expensive but you can get some
cheap ones actually and what you do is
just put it in front of your TV and then
when you watch your favorite soaps maybe
like Coronation Street or like in
America Real Housewives of New Jersey's
of them if you a cycle whilst watching
it it will allow you to lose quite a few
pounds because your concentration is
dedicated to what's going on the TV so
you're like watching to see what happens
and who murdered who and who's pregnant
with you and everything like that and
you won't really be thinking about how
much you liked moving and how much it's
really painful now the standard daily
calorie intake allowance
it says if your child 1,600 calories if
you're a grown woman one thousand eight
hundred and if you are a grown male two
thousand however that is not really true
that is just a very general
guideline if you do take a BMR
calculator online SATs BMR type into
Google BMR calculator all you need to do
is put in your weight height age just
general information like that and it
will tell you how many calories you
should be in a day now I says I should
be eating 1371 calories a day now
depending on maybe your height to weight
ratio when you're age and everything
like that it will differ depending on
the website that you use so will
actually tell you eat this many calories
to gain weight eat this many calories to
lose weight and if you want to lose
weight very fast eat this many calories
and actually some are so advanced
somethings like websites and things it
will tell you if you eat so many
calories a day and do so much exercise
you will lose so many pounds in so many
weeks and it's just really really
helpful so yeah use a advance BMR
calculator to find out how many calories
you should be in a day so high paced
songs to get your adrenaline running I
don't know if anyone else is ever
experienced this but I've experienced it
three times in my life so they are quite
rare but some songs do it one of them my
latest one was a Fetty WAP trap queen
cover by Andrew bossy I think it was and
it was a really high high paced when it
was just me kinda like you know like
feeling the music in a way but if you
find a really high paced song that'll
give you adrenaline you will just want a
workout like all the energy this build
up that you need to release you can
release it through your running machine
but if you do find yourself like a
really high energy fast paced song that
will give you maybe in a gentle English
or a build up of energy that needs to be
released if you're running or doing some
kind of workout it will really get you
moving and will really allow you to burn
extra calories last one a nice relaxed
one is to do 10 to 15 minutes of jump
rope this will burn 200 calories and
finally is one of the best ways to burn
cardio
even up there warning that is insane and
I obviously I haven't proved this I've
read this off so many like different
sites off the internet but excite
that's not really away from you to
tastic side on't really have the calorie
burning equipment to do so
but yeah jump rope an amazing thing
sidenote get a pedometer there's an app
called pacer on your phone that's really
amazing and you just if you're going to
school or whatever in my school there
are so many steps like everywhere so
when I have it activated on my phone I
will just put it in my blazer pocket or
in some kind of pocket and walk and by
the end of the day so I'm walking home
I've normally done about 6,000 steps
which is a lot compared to I think the
average in America anyways a thousand
steps a day so it's quite a blessing I'm
not too bad about losing weight it's
just maybe losing a bit of a stomach fat
or whatever and if you're getting
annoyed because I want to lose weight
just don't bother because it's my
personal preference if I want to lose
weight or not right now I'm pretty happy
with how I am but I guess everyone does
have a problem with their body at some
point in their lives so if you do have
any video requests that you want me to
do in the future leave it as a comment
below and don't forget to press that
thumbs up button and maybe even
subscribe have a beautiful day and don't
forget stay positive laughs bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
