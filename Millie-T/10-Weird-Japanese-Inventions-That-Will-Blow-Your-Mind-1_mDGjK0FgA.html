slightly different what I usually do not
hugely different but a little bit if
you've been watching my channel for a
while now you know that I really enjoyed
doing my genius invention video so
inventions as a whole really interests
me so when it comes to Japanese
inventions they're on a whole new level
if you enjoy it as you are watching it
please give this video a thumbs up can
we reach 1000 likes eventually this
first one is called a rockabyebaby robot
and if you want to relive your childhood
you can put place yourself in this robot
in its arms and it will just rock you to
sleep while staring at you that is
extremely creepy so you know sometimes
how you might take subway train or boss
and you might feel yourself getting a
little bit tired so you just kind of
force yourself to stay awake and because
you can't really fall asleep standing
upright apparently not because you can
buy a chin rest so if you're feeling
tired on a subway you can just rest your
chin on it like that and fall asleep not
only that but there is also a sleep
helmet you can buy which you wear on
your head it has a plunger attached to
it and you plunge yourself through the
window or material behind you and it
just stops your head from doing that and
like lolling about it just keeps it in
one place
yeah I just want to make a point that I
would buy this one it's a full-body
umbrella
so it's a normal umbrella to begin with
but if it starts raining and there's
like heavy heavy winds as well you can
drop a clear sheet down or clear
material down around you and it just
keeps you dry and your whole outfit dry
next is one you're probably seeing
around but I still wanted to make a
point of it flu season if you have a
cold
or you feel yourself sneezing runny nose
and you don't have any tissues on you
fear not because you can wear toilet
we're all on your head you it's like a
contraption so it's kind of a blue roll
holder that were you wear on your head
and then you just roll it down and blow
your nose I think this one is pretty
clever and it this is pretty genius this
one it's annual policy this is around as
well if you have facebook it's a mop
outfit for a baby so you know obviously
babies crawl crawl toddlers crawl as
well and they wear kind of outfits with
kind of mop material on the front so as
they are crawling they are actually
mopping up the floor and cleaning the
floors to go along that is how you make
the most out of a crawling toddler or
baby now this one just doesn't make
sense it's not even genius it's just
weird
and so this one is merely for my ladies
and obviously some men as well it's like
a mouthpiece you wear with a cutout with
some lips so if you are moving maybe you
want a boss and you want to do your
lipstick or you don't and you don't want
to mess it up you can just fill it in
like a coloring book but everyone's lips
are shaped differently so surely if this
cutout of lips are bigger than your
actual lips you're going to end up
getting lipstick all on this bit here
I'm really enjoying doing this video now
this one right I can
no I don't understand it us-ally really
don't it's not even it's not even
practical okay so an umbrella you know
how it usually goes this way over your
head well apparently if you turn it
inside-out or buy an umbrella buddies
inside-out like so it's that way if the
umbrella turns backwards it enables it
to catch rainwater which will travel
down the stem of the umbrella through a
tube and into a bucket of water or a
bucket that is collecting this rainwater
as you are walking now okay this one is
also on in public wearing this I would
just lose it shoes that have a tube
connecting it to the hat to like a
shower cap and as you walk you push air
out of these boots so the this air
travels up the tube and in to your hat
so then you get a big gust of wind and
it will dry your hair as you're walking
that's just weird
quite funny but weird so this one I do
find slightly worrying when it comes to
beauty standards it's a nose job
contraption so it has to tube like
things that are perfectly round that you
will put in your nostrils to make them a
perfect round shape then it has a tight
cylindrical shape thing that you that
goes on this bit of your nose like the
bridge of your nose and will make it the
perfect width and then it also has
another bit to it which will perfectly
shape these out of its here I doubt this
work so in my work temporarily but for
the long one I highly doubt it if it
does then I'm pretty impressed I can't
help but find this quite useful in a way
so if you're having noodles and you
might be eating with chopsticks maybe if
you go to a Chinese restaurant or in the
UK or even if you like
eating with chopsticks at home and you
have noodles and they are very hot when
you get them out you can attach a fan to
your chopsticks which will cool down the
noodles as you are eating them this
video has been so fun to do a part two
will be coming soon for part two will
probably be useful inventions so
Japanese inventions that are very useful
anyway I hope you enjoyed this video
make sure to subscribe and I will see
you in my next video have a beautiful
day and don't forget stay positive
