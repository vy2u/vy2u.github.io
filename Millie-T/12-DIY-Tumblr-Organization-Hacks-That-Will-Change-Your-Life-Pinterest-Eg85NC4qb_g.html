video is going to be 12 tumblr
organization hacks so I was looking
through Pinterest and I just picked up
some of my favorite hacks off there and
there are some really really nice ones
so I hope that you do them in the end
and if you do send me on it Twitter
Instagram snapchat wherever the hell you
want to I also started a second channel
so if you want to check that out it's in
the description below anyway on to the
video
so this first life hack just take a
little bit of work but all you need to
do is get your cereal boxes and just cut
out the bottom of the cereal box so that
you're left with a like a box to put
things in and you can do a range of size
you can get those mini cereal box so
it's your about this big and you can
like cut the bottoms off those so you
have like a really small box and you can
get a huge one so you have a really big
box and basically you can put those in
your makeup drawers and fit them to size
so that they offer in your drawer
perfectly and then place you made by
tims you've craft items whatever you
want to put in there and if you put
wrapping paper or scrapbook paper around
the cereal box boxes then they do look
really nice and it's just very tumblr so
the second one I know I feel like mason
jars i like really overused on youtube
like it gone to every DIY video on
youtube be room decor DIY room decor
every single one will have use mason
jars because they're just so popular i
don't even think we have them in england
though you can get similar ones they
kill their jars and things like that but
no mason jars any you if you stack them
so you can use a hot glue gun or
whatever you've got
i know you need to do is say for example
get three mason jars and put them on the
bottom and glue to get this other stuck
together and then glue two mason jars on
top of that and then one on top of that
so it's like a stack of them and then
it's really really good for putting like
you pens and pencils and highlighters
and stuff in it just looks really nice
from the images that i've seen online
anyway third one okay I've never been to
Tiffany's before but I think it's quite
an expensive store if you do have any
Tiffany bags at all or any bags of a
similar kind of like gift bags or
anything
what you can do is like stick them to
your wall using like glue dots and then
you can put things in them like craft
stuff pens pencil number four if you're
into the more vintage kind of things so
I used to do is I spray paint a cheese
grater and like put like legs on it as
well and then you can like cook your
earrings on swear I'm jewelry and it's
just a really nice stand number five
lotion bottle charge station so what you
need is to get a lotion bottle for
example of this and just cut it out but
when you cut you out make the back
taller than the front and then on the
back puts out a hole to put over the
plug socket and then you can just place
your phone into it and it just holds it
this stops your phone for Mike's
training and stops you charge from get a
turtleneck yeah my rotating goal list
now no words for this it just looks
amazing just look it up amazing but I
love this like rotating goal this one
because it just gives you so organizing
it's really really cute nice and very
little of it so this is the one is to
fight a vintage one as well if you want
to make it vintage in a way but it's
like an ice cube jewelry holder if you
can get into the more extravagant and
more like unique kind of looking jewelry
holders and then ask you trays are a
really good way to go and it's really
inexpensive too if you lose your bobby
pins like I do all the time then just
get a magnetic strip and you can just
place your bobby pins on there and it
just stops them from stops you from
losing them or you kind of gotta
remember to put them on the magnetic
strip and that's where I'd probably lose
them another unique one is a dream
catcher Joe a holder so edgy catcher if
you don't know what one of those days
it's like a works kind of thing I looks
like this and you can you see on the
webs mine's got a bell on it as well you
can get your earrings and actually like
cook them on there and your drawing
stuff and it's a really it's another
really good way to store your jewelry in
Easter egg snack order so if you're a
mommy or a sister or you pack your lunch
and you're in Paris called maybe he's in
high school then you can get like you
know the things you can find at the
Dollar Tree and you can actually use
these Easter eggs thanks to like put
snacks in this stuff and it just it
looks really nice it's a unique way to
kind of store your food I'm we all love
food scrapbook tink can holder so this T
one is really easy you just put a grab a
paper around tin cans
you can put things in it washi tape
calendar just look at the calendar do it
it looks amazing
