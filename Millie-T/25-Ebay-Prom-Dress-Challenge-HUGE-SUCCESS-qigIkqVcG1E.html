video
boy am I excited so I went onto eBay and
bought myself a complete promo outfit
for $30 that includes the dress the
shoes and the jewelry I have no idea how
these are going to turn out when they
call my obviously was arrived already
I've got the packages by my feet but I
don't know what's inside them yet
because I obviously haven't opened them
so I'm really really looking forward to
it I do actually want this video to be a
success if you are new to my channel hi
I'm Millie I do quite a few eBay videos
testing $3.00 ebay prom dresses and
stuff all I will make into a playlist if
you do want to watch the full a base
series playlist just click on the link
in the description it will be somewhere
down there in the description have a
home for it under the packages so this
one feels like the dress by the way this
is the image of the dress that I ordered
so this is what I'm expecting to receive
but obviously it was not very expensive
or this dress I paid $10 and by the way
I think those are not pounds because
when I order things off ebay I paste
them in dollars since either I say like
10 dollar dress or like 8 pound 97 pen
if I translate to pound so that's why
I'm saying dollars I'm not sure how I
feel about this I mean the lace feels
like pretty good lace quality I mean
compared to the other dresses at a bar I
mean they were jeans because they were
three dollars on five to 10 dollars but
I mean the lace feels pretty good it's
just this bottom bit that I'm not too
keen on if I goes from the waistband
down webside the skirt it's staged but
as icicles seems a little bit off I
think it might look a bit different in
the camera cause little lighting and
stuff but I don't know how I feel about
it I'll be sanded on with pay like $10
with a dress I can't be expecting a
world-class beauty pageant $10,000
looking dress but as I do with all my
ebay videos I just tell you what I think
when I look at the dress
so yeah the lady feels pretty good for
$10 or just a skirt that I'm not too
keen on it's just oh wait what this is
Swift
oh yeah just slit in the leg I don't
know I want to try it on and see of
course also the waist isn't very
elasticated so I can't see like gripping
my waist
I'm sorry type see what this looks like
as a whole with it everything the shoes
and jewelry flop this next package is
shoes I think it feels quite solid now
the shoes that I bought were none like a
regular list and on how to say but they
weren't like ten pairs the same thing it
was looks like a one-off listing with a
woman that was selling her secondhand
shoes and which she said that she'd worn
once and just didn't like them so
they'll think I'm also excited issues
because they were soldiers with Bhutan
shoes but clearly they weren't because
they were like 12 pounds three times
alike 700 pounds so I bought some review
tonnes like a few resource that I was
one of them and wear them to prom so I
have the real original here so I am
interested to be able to compare this
because the shoe that I ordered the
exact same style or the fact that they
are peep toe but I don't know I don't
know what to expect with them but yeah
they were so distribute on how oh my god
they actually look so good
that is crazy they were sort of
elaborate on us but they're not even
fake really Jesus from Bella women found
women so I think it was just inspired by
the Bhutan but what yeah wow this is
like it real versus fait là-bas hans in
there oh I should do a video on that
they are honestly like so similar honest
obviously the originals just genuine the
better manufactured as a whole because
like the salt to be like slightly coming
off at the front but they feel like
genuinely like solid shoe 12 pounds for
them and the fact that they're not even
trying to passes with blue translates
they wouldn't want them even MOG it was
just the seller that passed them at it
or the actual manufacturer of the shoe
that has their own brand called Belle
women but now you can't have a complete
profile for it without some jewelry
especially a tiara so I've got a three
dollar tiara and three dollar
jewelry in it
just package here so what does that
bring us to all together then the judges
$10 shoes were 12 dollars up $22 and the
tiara and jewelry was six dollars that's
$28 all together so basically a $30
outfit even less than that so I'm quite
excited I hope it doesn't look too tacky
but I reckon it probably will just sit
with the prize
oh what a tease the Pops packets in the
packet wait come again how does this
work
it's got like two holes on the edges I
don't know what to do without what you
put through the holes here it's just not
a good day is it so that was actually so
smooth that's the first time I've ever
tried to blow heroin mouthpiece actually
like move successfully I know I'm gonna
get comments now be like oh my god you
do dismiss in this is if she didn't know
to do that it's so obvious yeah I like a
lot of common sense I have no idea what
you do with it I don't really usually
wear tiaras oh wait was sore I'm like oh
the damage that way and obviously not
real diamonds well that's the net that's
a necklace oh they just look kind of
like flowers but it's got like it a
teardrop if you like G take pendants
right at the bottom Roger I that you
felt quite cute to do further with
promised I'd one just assumes
everything's expensive so I know that I
could wear that deparment people would
think it's like genuine and not like
$3.00 from available and then the
earrings I've got I've got gangbanged
Glee earrings we got up the dangle um
for prom and then the same it obviously
match the necklace with the dangling
pendant at the bottom that's what the
earrings are with the same slight flower
design object concerned about is it
again as I said with DTR the Diamonds
falling out finally the kite and they
aren't quite cute I'm so excited to try
this outfit on altogether and I just
know love the dress
one set is the only issue I mean I'm
primitive well it just doesn't look like
it well wait what the hell just from
this I didn't see that well the dress
came with a Bell Labs just found and oh
I don't like these bells because in my
actual testing eBay prom dresses my very
first one is three dollars one I had a
bell on them and it just like didn't
work it was not flattering at all so
belt with the exact same kind of rhythm
style of this so I don't really know
what to do with it it will like clutch
the waist a bit more but I'll have to
style it properly or try my best to
style it anyway some non professional
stylist so these things don't always
work out so I got a little bit gold so
yeah I'm pretty much doing with that
video me I start to try on the outfits
but so far it's been quite a big success
the model of this video is if you are on
a budget you can still get a good prom
outfit if you are my quite a big budget
well I like $30 for full power fees
quite a reach but we did it easily and
the stuff isn't even back the model of
this is told with you can easily buy a
prom on a big budget because their dolls
were full prom outfit is quite a push
cuz just compares like average spendings
at prom so this is the outfit and I
honestly blown away by it like the 25
pounds by excluding the tiara so it's
very situation with tiara where I have
to connect like bobby pins to it I'm
like elastic and I just don't have that
so luckily with your outfit if I did
have it on it won't let up we cannot
forget the shoes they are so like crispy
with boot on tooth is absolutely unreal
this has raised my expectations for
either have to say this is the most
successful eBay shopping video I have
ever done by far and can we just talk
about the lengths as well I'd be length
could not be any more perfect it just
about skin support is absolutely perfect
yeah here's a more close-up version as
well don't really know what they are
they kind of like flower style and the
thing that goes into this really thin
with the material you can kind of see
my underwear line here who makes it look
a little bit weird a little bit
unnatural to say like the whole life's
biggest thing it should fall out here
but it clings to everything actually
just clings to it so we're a nipple line
is you can see like an indentation it's
a little bit more on the inside that is
in the video ever so slightly big but
fit that I like fix that with these Bell
and everything
what yes 10 out of 10 would recommend I
I mean just going back to them I cannot
get over these shoes with all that
there's an actual genuinely boot on yeah
these ones are the plague ons not even
fake but the knock-offs if you would say
that but I mean by 12 pounds I I have
that pretty sure that she must have paid
a lot more than 12 pounds of them but
then when she sold them on she was I are
selling on for a bit of money I'm
tempted to keep you know I probably give
them to like a women's try see something
but oh my god so yeah I hope you enjoyed
this video if you did give this knobs up
and subscribe for more videos like this
and just my future videos in general if
you wanna see them
by the way I've trained changed up my
own child XO you sound beautiful down
there lies my beautiful day to really
cringey and I may be sighs want to throw
up every time I hear it I only just
realized like how cringe it was with the
day and when I was like Oh beautiful day
like less not so have an amazing day and
live life okay
