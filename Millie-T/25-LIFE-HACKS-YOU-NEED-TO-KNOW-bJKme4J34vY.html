different to what I normally do but I
hope you enjoy it nonetheless if you are
new to my channel please don't forget to
subscribe if you enjoyed this video and
if you are already subscribed please
give it a thumbs up if you enjoy it
the first life hack I have for you is to
coordinate your keys using nail polish
so you need to do is polish it or color
the head of the key like the top of the
key and do toe your keys
it will spice up your key collection and
it will also allow you to know which
keys for what
next one is if you ever have a power
outage or like power failure in your
house or town or whatever all you need
to do is get a crayon if you don't have
candles just going to crayon light it
with a match and it should burn for
about three hours
the next one is kind of cheeky but all
you need to do is send emails to big
companies I don't know
Hollister Walmart wherever as the
wherever and just say how you are a
loyal buyer of all their products but
recently you've been really disappointed
and you've bought a product that has
really let you down and you know the
free stuff should come rolling in
this next one is one that I am
definitely going to use when or if I
have a child basically all you need to
do is get them email address and from
the minute they are born send photos
messages letters all that kind of stuff
today that email address of their life
like I'd make a scrapbook online and
then they're on their 18th birthday all
you need to do is give them a piece of
paper with the username and password and
just tell them to log onto it and they
should bill to a huge collection of
things that happened in their life
if you want to be like public tumblr or
whatever all you need to do is get a
watts bottle empty or with watering and
on or which one works better you just a
break your glow stick put it in there
and set them up like bowling pins and
play it outdoor bowling at night glow in
the dark
I should have such a great idea
this is a girly one but to give super
soft legs all you need to do is shave
your legs then use a sugar scrub or an
exfoliating man and just exfoliate them
both and then shave again maybe using a
conditioner or shaving foam and then
moisturize and your legs should be
really soft also using a man's razor
also gets a really close car if you just
want your hairs to wait awhile before
going back
so I'm sure can all relate to this
during the summer time or any time of
the year really when we want ice-cold
water to take to school what happens
this we normally put it in there freeze
and I would take it out but the ice
doesn't actually melt until the day is
over which is very annoying well this is
a new strategy to this which I am so so
happy about all you do is fill the water
bottle halfway put it on its side and
place it in the freezer and then in the
morning take it out and fill the other
half with water and you should have
ice-cold water then whenever you want
all through the day also in addition to
that marking out your water bottle with
times helps you drink it accordingly so
you can either copy what this person is
marked down from this picture here or
you can make your own whatever you want
to do
if you want to stop texting you cuz they
or a company or whatever all you need to
do is send them this message here
service arrow 3 or 5 message delivery
failed further messages will be charged
to your account
so if you've got a relatively small
wardrobe I need to do is offset your
clothes or hangers using a tap of your
kind of cork so you hang this part
through one hangar and the bottom part
through another hangar and it will upset
your clothes allowing you to make the
most of your space
if you turn a muffin pan upside down and
put tortilla shells on though it should
make the perfect taco taco shell I don't
know how to pronounce it that's British
problems pronouncing American things
well I normally relate tacos tacos with
America spray the pan with cooking oil
and plate Totalus over the top and bake
in the oven for 10 minutes at 375
degrees
if you are like Brighton of your style
and have a more quirky style all you
need to do is tie ribbons colorful
ribbons around your foot like that and
then put on a plain pair of dollar shoes
and it should really brighten your style
and I think that could be a new fashion
trend
watch out Volk we're coming
the problem with ad generation is that
we have way too much technology and with
technology generally comes wires and
charges and it's very very difficult to
give them all organized and owed you for
this is decorate a shoebox or use your
own box or whatever and cut holes
circles in them and thread your wires
through there and caption them with what
the wire is for to keep your ways nice
and organized and spice up your room to
make it look very nice
for a quick in the easy iphone speaker
all you need to do is cut a slit on the
top of a toilet roll tube pop your phone
in there and get like drawing pins and
stab them into the toilet roll to hold
it up and that should be great as an
iPhone speaker just copy height iPhone
in there and like the sound burst out
www dot futureme.org allows you to send
emails to yourself in the future I've
done this for a year from now say it all
I hope this is how you're doing in
school I hope this is how you're doing
with this person and I hope this is how
you're doing with YouTube and all that
and that should arrive on October the
4th 2015
that stage where I really really really
want a tattoo but obviously they are
permanent so it's probably not the best
way to go so if you want a long-lasting
temporary tattoo if that makes sense
we need to do is get a sharpie and draw
the tattoo where if you want more people
will want an infinity symbol on the
wrist and then route baby powder on it
I'll just pop baby powder on the tattoo
and spray it with hairspray and then
just kind of like dust it off and the
tattoos are supposed to last like three
months after that
but if you're very productive in your
life unlike me and you will want to do
this then all you need to do is to spice
up your pencils for school is to get
washi tape that you can't find anywhere
in England and just kind of like wrap it
around the pen a portrait wise and then
like wrap it around like that and you
have a new and improved pencil Wow
this is another beauty one but one thing
that got made artists and way too many
online forums have taught me is to never
dot concealer under your eyes like this
this isn't I always used to do but
instead of dotting it like that and
kinda spread it downwards in a
triangular shape like this as it
brightens up the whole face and if you
just do it in one area like that you'll
be able to see the bags anyway even if
the brighter but if you kind of expand
the space it they're completely
disguised
so when we're just about to play nail
polish most of us just got okay so let's
start but a lot of people have said to
instead of just shaking it roll it
between your hands like that because
shaking it produces the air bubbles
which then are transferred onto the
nails but if you roll it it still mixed
up the nail polish but you don't get any
of them annoying air bubbles on your
fingernails
if you want to the beach very often and
you want to go somewhere but then you
have to take all your valuables with you
well now if you do want to risk it then
all you need to do is get a cold lotion
tube cut it in half and place all your
valuables slide them all underneath so
people just think it's some televsion
and they won't pay any attention to it
more slightly
if you like me and really really really
bad are setting phone passwords all you
need to do is set to your password
there's an accented letter on your
iPhone I think that's just such a great
idea an amazing idea because no one in
the world is going to guess that I won't
even think to guess that someone's
password
so when the ice cream van comes past at
night I'm still I'm still a child when
it comes to getting ice cream okay I
brought to the ice cream fan and I've
got like a bubble gum wall-e or whatever
and I'll come back and then I'll be on
my computer like this and I'll be eating
it and then you sauce dripping on my
computer and like oh no there's not good
but the problem is apparently solved we
need to do is get a like a cupcake
holder and just as push that through the
lollies and the liquid or the melted
liquid from the lowly will collect in
that boom they're just messed up my hair
we can PD to me for the best place to
get school answers from for like an
essay or whatever but the problem is
I've gone to it and I'll be so much
stuff that I'm just not interested in
and it's just I don't understand most of
the words so what you do is replace the
en on the Wikipedia L with simple to
strip away the complex and irrelevant
information on the article which is
basically all of it
just me that when I watch your movie a
dog's death is more upsetting than a
human death I don't think it is just me
move this isn't people I don't know but
sometimes I've brought into the film you
just like will happen to the dog there
died did it stay alive what did it is he
alive of what happened to it well to do
that is go on to dose the dog died calm
and type in almost any film and he'll
tell you whether the dog survived got
her off was killed
problem solved
this one is one that has bugged me for a
long long time and it's basically just
telling you that L I've hacked make your
life so much more easier is it is not I
could care less if you're in an argument
with someone and they go all right well
I'm I'm better than you and then you go
I could care less that's wrong it
doesn't make any sense if I couldn't
care less
cuz see I could care less say is that
you care you care a lot because you
could care less than what you're already
caring but saying I couldn't care less
is saying I am so not bothered at all
that I couldn't even care any less so I
couldn't care less just a life tip for
you those are a collection of 25 life
hacks for all you people out there they
