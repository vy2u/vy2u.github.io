Millions because you mean millions to me
you're worth a million pounds each and
every one of you and it's Milly and
years
I love minions which millions and
minions but your millions so it's like
minions Milly minions many millions you
know I mean so come on below if you like
that name or not it might not like and
if you don't then I'll just ditch it and
then fight it with the one if you like
it or not and so 9 million if you don't
like me calling you that then obviously
I'll stop um but this is how to achieve
your natural look in no time so it's
Andy like before school and things so
first of all we is gonna ditch the
foundation and powder and we're gonna go
from moisturize so I've got like a
prescribed moisturizing one that I'll
properly moisturize his face and but you
can use like new viewing things but I'm
a really tip for baseless it's but
eczema but I don't have extra many more
but yeah so apply this to your face
instead of foundation and then you can
put a bit I've gone then you can put
kind of seal in one after that because
obviously you can't tell and if you've
got a lot of spots like acne then it's a
vital thing so I'm gonna apply this to
my whole face now on my eyelids as well
and yes what your face goes a bit white
well it can also kind of wipe it on your
face if you're wiping your hands on your
face oh and if it goes on your lips then
that wipe your lips it doesn't taste
nice this one and I'm also sometimes
what I do is I spray in my face because
this doesn't smell nice
just be like body spray okay um so
that's that another one from moisturize
and conceal but I don't have any spots
right now so I need to conceal but don't
use powder or foundation because it's
natural next are your eyebrows now I've
already done my eyebrows but I'll do
them again because I love you guys I'm
closer so
here I have benefits browsing I'm going
to use for my eyebrows but you can use
an eyebrow pencil or anything like that
and so with this one I'm going to go for
a light color because if you go too dark
you're gonna look like a let's be
honest and you're gonna go from your
natural brows so make it keeping thin
so I'm only gonna go one so we doesn't
take two seconds this because we're
going for natural and this will take you
five minutes to do so that's when I
brought down as you can see there's so
much of difference everybody doing it
just got a bit darker because it's like
a second layer basically so here's on to
the other one
make sure the thicker up the star and
then thinner at the encyclical thinnest
and thicker at the end it's gonna look
so poor weird so there we've gone right
to the end and think they are equal so
for the eyeshadow you helped news
purples or blues or Pink's or reds or
anything like that we are going to stick
to being neutral and we are going to use
well I'm going to use 17 smokey eye
palette like this and if I open it up
stop down
how's this oh there we go it looks like
this so first of all I'm going to use
this end of the brush and I'm going to
choose a pale color this color here and
play on the brush quite a bit and just
basically push over my eyes with it okay
I'm with this one just like I'm gonna
gold whips the eyebrows highlight the
eyebrows how the brow bone I call it
it's easy one call there right to the
eyebrows and I'm going to do the same on
the other right so I'll do that right
now
so I'm gonna go over them a bit marks I
made it sure it's highlighted more at
the start
cuz it just don't know why but it just
does make it look better so I've gone
over the tops and now if she wants you
I'm gonna use the lighter color this
color here and I'm gonna go and just
brush over my buttons because it will
waken up my eyes more and and reduce the
amount of tiredness it makes without
being too obvious so that looks pretty
the obvious if I'm honest which is good
because I can just blend it in after so
I'm gonna get in on in on with blending
it so it looks normal but still conceals
my bags cleaner brush
so I'm gonna use this thick bush now dab
it on the neutral color here and just go
down here and on the other side as well
we can't completely reduce them because
we're going for a natural look so we
can't use the loads of makeup and
leather because that completely defeats
the object so it's a walk up my eyes a
little bit there um so now I'm going to
move on to Browns it's quite a dark
brown but preferably use this type of
brush so it's like a instead of that
type this types it just pushes on is
makers obvious so this here and just
push it over and make it a neutral brown
color so I'm gonna darken that a bit
more I'm not gonna go up to the brow
bone because obviously that's where I
want it to be highlighted and now move
on to the other side and I'll do that
really quickly this is a natural look so
I'm not gonna go like so you stock
colors here and then go lighter because
I'll become obvious so I've just read it
darker to make your eyes look bigger
believe it or not because doc I might
say it I think it makes them look bigger
mm-hmm
so that's it today I shadow now if you
like you can get a dark color like this
for the eyes as well get it on the edge
of day and this type of brush and kind
of go to the corners here to make your
eyes look darker naturally
and then you have to do a lot of
blending after that it makes your eyes
look very very dark but some people like
that kind so I'm gonna M do that bit
more so now my eyes will look darker it
might not be too obvious but I think
it's quite obvious but that's just me
but that's just me so I really like them
in the bottle so now onto the mascara oh
here it is lost it for a second now
so with mascara it's not going to be as
obvious as I normally do it so we're
just gonna stroke of her eyelashes not
both sides just one side
okay and now to the right
oops to both sides that I wanna make my
own sake call for the mascara I used la
vie L volume million lashes yeah and so
now for my lips I'm going to use elf and
it's going to be the lip plumping one so
I'm just going to plump my lips for this
one so if you have any sort of lip
plumping substance put that on if not
get some vaseline or lip balm and put
that on and you can be risky news tinted</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
