have this teddy bear here because it's
getting towards Christmas Merry
Christmas I got ins calendar yeah so you
gotta have to bear with me because he's
gonna be watching you always okay so
this is my favorite hairstyles that
quick and easy for school video and
there will be five different hairstyles
one for every day of the week and you
have to comment your favorite day of the
week hairstyle so let's get going
because I hate long introductions and I
gotta eat my tea the kids right here I
have pester so let's go down with it
okay so Toph was just gonna simply brush
your hair yes I have a P or piece of
pasta on my tie I did not know and next
he was going to find your parting and
find a natural pearl parting you just
have to like shake your head a little
public fall on that joy and then give it
another brush through okay so next we're
going to get all your hair and move it
over to one side of your head it doesn't
matter which side just any side then
you're going to get one to one and a
half inches of hair off the top of your
head like so and you're going to split
it into three sections so you're going
to French braid okay so for this year's
going to plat it normally once and then
when you have a loose piece that you are
not hold off and all that you can easily
let go of and you will keep collecting a
new piece of hair and just adding to it
each time from the top and bottoms then
so top you found the bottom piece of
hair as well actually for this one you
only use the top silk like from the top
but it can be either and so if you don't
know how to French plat than just social
videos on YouTube there are absolutely
loads of videos on YouTube about how to
French blade braid blade I love it sound
a bit painful in it that sounds a bit
painful French bleeding and so yeah
searching French braiding and she'll
find plenty videos and it's really easy
once you get the hang of it so now I've
plotted about an inch down for my ear
I'm going to collect it all to the side
and tie a bubble to it
I like that bubble because it's not got
n the metal bit on it so it doesn't
really um Snap is often at all I've
never had one of them bubbles that snap
so that's really good and so this is my
finished look I will show you it closer
now I'm such a poser but I need to M
screenshot song for this thumbnail take
an easy way out you can also add a
headband and under pair of earrings and
to help with the style so the headband
I've chosen is white and red and spot a
and that's the French plat up close and
you could probably see how you can wear
my hair's gone in for the French plat on
top of my head and I just think now it's
really nice
the plot gets bigger as it goes along
obviously it's pieces of hair getting
bigger as to adding to them
okay so for this one you're going to
move all your hair to the back of your
head
straighten if you like and just brush it
through you all might also want a mirror
in front of you so you can see what's
going on then grab a mirror
it can go wrong so we're going to do is
gonna push your hair back so from the
front you're going to push your fringe
back and all of your head back so just
all yeah so what you've done that you're
going to use your thumbs and estimate
whereabouts you want your hair and
you're going to use your thumbs and push
them too close together which L bun
which will bunch up your hair which you
can easily put into a bubble so I've
estimated this amount of hair that I
want to use and I'm happy with that so
um what I'm going to do is bunch it all
together push it back as well for extra
help like I'm doing there I just push it
back and I will also use a small thin
green bubble which I will show you now I
just have to find it it is a small green
bubble if you have a strict uniform
policy then you can use thin and blue
bubble whichever and also you might want
to use a thicker bubble depending on
your hair another thing that you can do
with this look is you can also like put
it into a ponytail as well or anything
like that it just looks really good
because basically when you've got your
fringe back and get it out of your eyes
and face I just wait keeps your hair out
of your eyes oh my god I'm cracking up
keeps your hair out of your face
throughout the day so that's really good
also again you can add a band and I have
more hair bands and just that one I just
like that amongst it's probably one of
the biggest it also looks nice when it's
part of to the side and this is it in
full
now as can see it goes quite flat
against my head but that's what the
headband looks like and you can put your
hair off to one side and you can put it
back and then put it to two sides which
looks nice from the back as well and add
earrings as well so if you don't like
your hair being
that back you can basically grab the
bubble and push it forward like towards
towards whatever's in front of you and
then get some bobby pins yeah an
extension I tried to look for some back
aren't finding it so pushing it for and
then just tight and attaching bobby pins
to it so that helps a lot
some people prefer their hair to be push
more forward so that's my completed look
okay for this one it's going to be the
waterfall braid now for this one I've
sweetly looked it took me a while and so
you're going to get a section of your
hair at the front and split it into
three sections and it's going to be
about one to one-and-a-half inches the
hair then you're going to plot it
normally until you get into the middle
now with a waterfall blade braid blade
seen blade okay um so also I'll just
remember this is going straight across
the head so don't make sure it doesn't
slop downwards so you're going to do is
and when you get to the middle of your
head will middle of the side of your
head you're when you have the piece that
falls down that you want to be using so
you've got the two pieces that are the
closest to your head the parting of your
head drop your head and you've got a
piece I'll just be dangling below so
you're going to get that piece and put
it in your mouth as you can see and just
left and then take another piece the
same size and just continue with that
once through and then put that piece in
your mouth and get a new piece and
eventually it will look like that if you
don't have to waterfall then look at the
tutorial on YouTube date is that really
easy to follow
that one's failed as you can see I will
bump in my hair but I will try not to do
it to slopes I know it gets a bit boring
when it's too slow so to fix the bump I
just use a bobby pin what you do with
this you continue until the back of your
forehead and then get it the opposite
piece of your hair like the other side
of your head and kind of plot it and put
it back as well so that's that look for
Wednesday
okay Thursday's look is one of my
favorites so what you're going to do
with this one is find the middle section
of your hair if you've got a middle
parting then follow down from that if
not then don't what you're going to do
is you're gonna brush both sides of your
hair and make sure it's thoroughly
bushed and then get two bubbles and
basically say it about an inch below
your ear if they look a bit geeky if
they're really um high up so just make
sure they kind of suck down a bit suck
down sound so unprofessional
just make sure they are it's quite loose
so if your bubbles don't have to be
exactly the same I think they look
better when the not choice oh that's
really simple just too plain pigtails
that don't look good game ok so this one
is going to be the same but plat so
split two sides of your hair and do
really the loose class so as you can see
here I'm doing that and then you're
going to stop doing the plat about 3/4
of the way down special is still quite a
lot of hair left and else it will look a
bit kooky if you like the geek look than
that's perfectly fine I prefer to not go
for the geeky look so that is what I do
if you want to go for the geek look then
just do your hair all the way to the
bottom and move put your pigtails higher
or plat tails
so yeah just keep plugging that all the
way down and stop when it gets to about
the year what and plot it a bit lower
down and to your the one and and then
stop it when you and tell you when you
think it's equal to you opposite one
because if they're uneven it'll look a
bit stupid
so I'm trying that now
so that needs to go down a bit to them
to be even and I think that's about
right
okay so this one we're going to go for
one and an updo we haven't done one yet
so it's going to push all so all you
have fold and just push it through
because underneath it gets very nothing
then you're going to push it on to a
bone on top of your head yes to make
sure it's on top of your head start up
with and then push it back and push it
to a rather how you'd like it so I want
about there our baby girl took that
behind my ear so once I got it down I'm
going to keep pushing it and then tie it
up in a and secure bubble that wants up
then I'm going to get another one to
make sure that it doesn't snap okay so
that's that's so far and you can also
split into two sides if you like now
what you're going to do is we're going
to hide the bubble because they don't
look good
so get a strand of your hair not very
big about sighs I've got there and
you're just going to simply and make
sure it's part from you and the hair so
it's on its own and then just wrap it so
I saw with wrapping it no go and just
wrap it around to your bubble bubble so
you can't see your bubbles okay so
you've got two different types of bobby
pins you've got the normal one so
together and then you've got the other
ones which are quite far apart which are
really good for this type now I'm going
to use both of them for this so what
you're going to do is wear your own
strand of hair ends you're going to and
secure it with a bobby pin and just make
sure it goes underneath so none and the
bobby pins stick out and that's that
look completed all the hair tutorial is
done for what it's Friday comment your
favorite day of the week
