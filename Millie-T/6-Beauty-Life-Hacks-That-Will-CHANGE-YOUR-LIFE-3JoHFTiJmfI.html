my channel today's video is going to be
a beauty hacks video all of these I
scored from interest I've had a kind of
life hacks TVs going on in my channel
for quite a while now
and you guys seem to really enjoy
watching them so as long as you enjoy
watching them I will continue to make
them so if you do have any requests for
a life hack themed video that I could do
maybe back to school anything like that
let it a comment below and I will be
sure to take into consideration also
kinda random not gonna lie but I didn't
like you I'm Nick on video like a week
or so ago and in it I made just kinda
I'm not advertising it by the way after
watched if you don't want to
I made this kind of plant life thing and
I just stuck a loader once in it cat
tire I think it's so cute it adds like
loads of texture to my room and I put it
on my windowsill and I love it I don't
even have to water it so they don't die
like all my other plants do this first
life hack today presenting you is the
right way to apply concealer so instead
of dotting the concealer under your eye
as you can see I have done in this clip
here make a triangle shape with your
concealer under your eye this just
ensures that you conceal as many
imperfections as possible and also
highlight a larger surface area on your
cheek number two you may have heard of
this hack before but it is a ponytail
lengthening hag and it is extremely
effective so I really really hope that
you will try this out what you need to
do is take the top section of your hair
and just tie that into a ponytail then
once you've done that you can then move
on to the underneath or the bottom
section and tie that into a very low
ponytail and very bottom of your head
and this has to be centered underneath
the top section too
then after that you can move on to add
just the ponytail as you wish and then
when you turn around the back of your
hair is so unbelievably long if I were
to just do a standard ponytail what my
hair will be half the length shown in
this clip number three is the old famous
to keep its bow cross hack to do this
grab your lip liner and draw a cross on
your Cupid's bow as shown this enables
you to have a very defined kylie jenner
lip shape and from there you can extend
outwards to complete the look
from there I went in with my Mac Rihanna
collection lipstick and just cool it in
my lips basically and then went in with
the NARS creamy concealer to clean up
the edges
life hack number four allows your
perfume to last all day long or almost
all day anyway what you need to do is
spread on a really thin layer of
Vaseline before applying your perfume
this prevents evaporation and makes
smell last much longer hack number five
will enable your head stay in place all
day
all you will need is a bobby pin and
some hairspray separate the bobby pin so
you can like get around all the areas
and just spray it with hairspray
completely then apply it to your hair
and this will just allow the hair to
stay in place all day and it'll also
capture any stray hairs
damnit
so if you ever experience that very
annoying hassle of a bobby pin falling
out of your hair after you have done an
amazing hairstyle then you probably
insert it into your head this way when
in reality you should flip the bobby pin
upside down and insert it that way this
life hack ensures that your hair stays
in place all day and it even works with
all of you that have very thick hair
also if you notice my mouth moving
throughout this video like you can see
now it's because I had music playing on
my Mac and I was just kind of singing
along as you do anyway that is the end
of today's video I really hope that you
enjoyed it if you did give it a thumbs
up and I will see you in my next video
