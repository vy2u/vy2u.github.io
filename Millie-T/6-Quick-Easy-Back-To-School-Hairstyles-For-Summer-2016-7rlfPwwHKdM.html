to today's video which is quick and easy
hairstyles wah school college university
a job interview whatever occasion you
are going to hopefully one of these
hairstyles at least will help as you are
watching if you enjoy what you see
alright when you see them please press
the subscribe button and join me on my
youtube rollercoaster I don't know why I
said that
you
so the first time
well I have for you is called the t's
and tine is definitely one of my
favorite hairstyles what you're going to
need is maybe a volumizing spray or a
styling mousse and what you need to do
is just work that into your roots to
give you that extra volume that you're
going to need to complete this hairstyle
my natural hair is like extremely flat
so using this spray really helps me to
get that added off if you like anywho
after that I then began flatting my hand
I used one to one and a half inches of
it to do so if you don't know how to
play hair look up a tutorial on maybe
Google or YouTube and I can assure you
you will learn how to do it in no time
then the plat comes in extremely useful
because you can tease your hair some
more and then use the plat to trap it in
place and to stop it from coming loose
throughout the day this hairstyle is
great for me on those days where I
probably should have washed my hair the
night before but then I didn't and this
just really helps to hide in it or your
whiney greasiness in my hair so I would
highly recommend it so for number two I
decided to a mix things up a little bit
and go for an updo which is a ponytail
wrap so the first step is to take a
small section of hair and you can either
twist it or leave it plain twisting it
gives you a more messy effect in the end
which I personally prefer bar is all up
to you
then wrap it around your bubble quite
simply and another quick tip is to wrap
it around clockwise as I find it just
helps the momentum as a whole then once
you get to the end of your hair you can
secure it with a bobby pin now if your
hair is very very long you might
experience troubles and if you do then
just take a small section of hair so
it's more thinner and easier to work
with and this is the end result
number three is an amazing amazing
hairstyle but it's going to be very
difficult to explain so bear with me
first of all put your hand to a normal
ponytail but on the last black bubble
wrap only pull a small section of your
hair through the more hair that you pull
through the bigger the bun will look at
the end anyway once you have done that
you will find that there is still a lot
of hair left like hanging out of the
bubble
so get that and pull it through the bone
as you can see if you don't really
understand then just watch this over and
over again and you will easily
understand in no time so in the end
it'll kind of like it messy kinda bunch
of hair but then just get the ends of
your fan looking bun and just pull it
down and secure it with bobby pins it
might take you a few goals to get the
hang of but it is such a simple thing
once you do get the hang of it and I
really hope that you will give this a go
because it has been a lifesaver for any
days I need to throw my hair up into a
bun
so during the filming of this video I
decided to go on Pinterest and I saw
this as I was scrolling down so I
decided to give it a go right on the
spot this is my first time doing it and
it came out successful
a messy bun came out successful on me
and I didn't end up looking like a
trainwreck so to complete this hairstyle
start by sectioning your ponytail into
two parts and twisting each part now I
didn't really didn't know what to do
with one one side finish so I could move
on to the other so I chose to hold it in
place by using my mouth extremely
hygienic I know anyway once I had
twisted each part I then began to like
wrap them around each other I really
don't know what I did but I just kind of
wrap them in opposite ways like around
each other that is as much as I can
explain because at this moment right now
I was like hey hey this might work so
anyway I squash it down wrapped a bubble
around it and it worked and then after
the filming of this video I was so
amazed if I tried it again and it still
worked so you guys give this hairstyle a
go and if it works oh if it doesn't let
me know in the comment section below
number five is going to be a subtle
bridge and ignore I picked you to sort
then it was a slight confusion in
editing all you need to do for this is
take a small section of hair behind your
ear and just plug that all the way down
once you get to the end of your plat you
can then secure it with a clear elastic
or a hair color matching bubble and all
that any American viewers might find it
really worth it a you see the word
bubble so just in advance yes I say
bubble I am British that's what we say
here in England please don't judge me
for it and also I love this one because
it takes around 20 seconds to do so if
you like walking out the door you can
like do it easily so it really is a
running late hairstyle so I really hope
that you will use it and take into
consideration to use in your daily
routine
number six is aim of the hair down
hairstyle and it is a two way braid now
this one I have known for a few months
now and it was super easy from the start
and you will find it easy as well and it
only takes around 2 to 3 minutes what
you need to do is take a small to medium
sized chunk of hair from behind your ear
on both sides and plug them all the way
down next partition your hair and beyond
so a reference yes my queen slay
partition your hair into two sections to
make way for your plug to come up up
across the top of your head down the
side and behind the ear on the opposite
side then you can secure it with a bobby
pin or more depending on how thick or
how curly your hair is as you can see
your hair will need to be quite long to
do this but if it's not quite there yet
then just come back to this video in a
few months once your hair has grown a
bit and then try and recreate this look
then and hopefully it will be successful
this look serves no practical purpose
but it is quick easy and spices up any
look that is official at the end of the
video I really hope that you enjoyed it
have a beautiful day and don't get stay
positive my bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
