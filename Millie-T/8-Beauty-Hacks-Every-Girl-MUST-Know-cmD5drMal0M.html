down for every single one of my videos I
don't think I've ever filmed a video our
heads up because I can just never be
bothered so sorry about that hello
everyone its Nelly welcome to this video
which is going to be I think eight
beauty hacks to hopefully make your life
a lot easier also I'm going to put like
together all of my hacks videos into one
playlist so if you want to watch that
playlist you can have a watching spree
of all of my hacks videos if you really
want to whilst watching this video if
you like what you see give it a thumbs
up and also press the subscribe button
as there will be a lot more beauty hack
videos to come in the future I'd want
you to leave a comment the most or
because I really like reading your
comments and replying to them so please
do that have a nice time watching this
video enjoy yourself so the first Beauty
hack I have for you is how to turn an
old clunky mascara into a less
solidified one so all you need for this
one is some contact solution for contact
lenses I don't wear glasses I just use
colored contacts sometimes if I feel
like it and all you need to do with this
solution is put one two three jobs into
your clumpy mascara and then either
shake it around or keep pumping it with
the wand and then it you can't really
see it on camera but it just on
solidifies your mascara completely and
my benefit they're real mascara was
getting clumpy and I was devastated
but this hack saved it Beauty hat number
2 shows you how to cut off your split
ends of your hair so all you need to do
is get all of your hair to one side and
twist it however if you have layered
hair don't do this or else you'll end up
cutting your hair but if you have normal
hair like me twist it and then the kind
excess hair that sticks out just cut the
ends off that with a pair of scissors
and it just gets rid of your split ends
because I have way too many I need a
haircut number three is just applying
baby powder in between your mascara
application process and it makes your
eyelashes more volumous and lengthens
them and just makes your mascara looks a
lot better gives you the kind of false
lash effect and as you can see here they
are quite clumpy but an eyebrow brush
not an eyebrow brush and eyelash brush
just does the trick for those
sometimes when I use concealer without
using a base first concealer creases
under my eyes and it's extremely
frustrating but to prevent this all you
need to do is put some primer on
beforehand and then put your concealer
on and it's a very very smooth
application so still sticking with the
theme of eyes I now need to brighten
them so to achieve this I use the NYX
jumbo eye pencil in milk or use any
white eyeliner and I just run that along
my waterline and this gives my eyes the
effect of being brighter and makes me
look more wide awake I don't know if
this happens to you or not but I know
for me from the transition to autumn to
winter the skin on my face gets very dry
especially on my nose so to prevent this
or stop it from getting more dry and
moisturize it I just apply some lip balm
just give ear to my nose and it works
very well all right and I will seem to
be on a theme of Nivea but this one is
to exfoliate your lips so just apply a
layer of Nivea lip balm to your lips and
then use a new toothbrush to exfoliate
them and this just allows your lipstick
to apply a lot more smoothly and also
the bristles aren't harsh on your lips
which is always good now when you apply
your makeup
the lighting in your room always isn't
the best option so just go into your car
and use the mirror in your car to check
if your contour is blended if your
foundation is the right shade and if
your eyebrows are on fleek because car
lighting is the best lighting you can
have the eight beauty hacks are now done
