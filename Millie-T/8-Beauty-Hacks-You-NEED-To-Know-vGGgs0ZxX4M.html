video is going to be a breech act part
two
I have eight beauty hacks in total so
let's just get right on to them
so this first boot hag does take a lot
of practice or not a lot but quite a bit
practice anyway it did for me but
between you can curl unlined your
eyelashes at the same time all you need
to do is get your eyelash curler and
line the top rim of the eye color with a
I pencil Kohl liner anything like that
and then just go on and curl your lashes
and it should actually line your eyes
and claw your eyelashes at the same time
if you get it at the right angle and
place this next one that put a little
bit of a story to go along with this one
so once I went into testicles and the
Maybelline Jim mousse-like they were all
the rage like seven eight months ago
something like that and and so I hadn't
got one of course and there was there
were all eight pounds apart from a dark
one at the side it wasn't really dark
it's like kinda dark and that was one
pound for tonight and I was like I just
want to get that so I've got an abuti um
and I was like you know what what do I
do with this now
and then I thought I hate well if I like
if I mix a light foundation in with it
first of all like that's quite obvious
one that I'll make it lighter
of course other than that you can have
mixed BB cream in with it a moisturizer
in there anything like that will make it
lighter so yeah if you see really two
foundation but it's dark but it's still
good quality then just take it home and
mix in a foundation a light foundation
or moisturizer with it and it should
work okay I'm kind of an off topic when
I'm watching Pretty Little Liars on
Netflix and Jesus it's amazing I love it
and the vampire divers have started as
well again like it was on like yesterday
no two days ago three days ago three
days ago and it's amazing this next hack
summer I think it's a little bit weird
but oh well if you have a good clumpy
mascara always quite old then I used to
do shove it down your bra for about five
minutes five ten minutes and like that
and then it shall warm it up and also
it'll curl your eyelashes really really
well and it won't be clumpy anymore
renew your mascara be tack
twee is basically how to put on lipstick
/ lipliner right so if you don't know
what the Cupid's bow is it's like a
little arch and really a lip that looks
like a fine bird that you do when you're
younger it can be been an issue but when
I was a tiny spot like fancy dress
lipstick and stuff and I used to be like
I like Miranda sings basically just
flashback to Miranda sings or goes to
our channel and you will know what I'm
talking about
anyway but all you need to do to get a
lip liner our lipstick lip line is
definitely best and just mark an X on
you keep this bowl to get the shape
right and then just go ahead and fill in
your lipstick as usual I know now like
quite a lot of rage is like long stick
eyelashes so with this Peter have using
a both so you need to do is put on a
coat of mascara as usual and then with a
q-tip / cottonbud / whatever the hell
you want to call them to dip them in
baby powder I just kind of caught them
on your lashes like so and then put on
your next layer of mascara and trust me
this one works
it's amazing definitely definitely
recommend this one so if you have one of
those days where your scalp and it's
looking like horrible like - my hair is
just not looking very good today I used
too far too much products on it
yesterday last night I wasn't even going
anywhere I was like 12 o'clock in the
morning and I was just like you know
what I want to try out my hair products
what a mistake anyway so yeah she parks
is looking a bit dead in Terraria you
know you need to do is get a shadow that
matches your hair and just go ahead and
