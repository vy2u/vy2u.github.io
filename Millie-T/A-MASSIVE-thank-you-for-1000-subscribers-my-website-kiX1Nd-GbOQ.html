happy with 400 views and now my most
most viewed video has almost 15,000

everyone
just thank you so much for everything
that you've done
because you've been with me from the
very start and I just really appreciate
it and everyone says really nice
messages and quite a few people have
been asking for my p.o box and now I'm
not really sure that PR box is its it
like a post office where you have your
own individual like a locker a kind of
thing and you open it and then it's got
all your mail in it that may be because
people have sent it and something if you
dis can you come out what it is please
cuz um I think they do it in England I
probably do probably I just I'm really
bad at this kind of thing and so you've
been asking for my peal box I haven't
actually got one if that is what it is
and I'm not going to and it gives you my
home address because obviously get some
weirdos on here that I'll just try and
rape me and I don't really want that
believe it or not and so I'll try and
get my peal box to you and soon even
though I'm not gonna know I'm a few
people said that they'll send me mail
but if you and do send me anything
probably won't probably get nothing but
you know it's there for future as well
and if you do then I actually love you
and I'm open them all in a video and me
forget anything you know always worth a
try and just in case it's though if you
want to at all so thank you for being
there for me from the beginning of
YouTube oh I would apply to all your
mail and everything like that and so
thank you so much again and I really
really really really appreciate it and
and thank you for watching this bar and
I'm just I'm really really really
grateful so thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
