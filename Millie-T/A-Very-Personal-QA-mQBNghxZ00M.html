Wow my testing eBay justice video did a
lot better than I expected which is
absolutely amazing it meant that those
mouths
what sixty thousand will review that
probably don't know about me so I
thought you know what I'll do a personal
Q&amp;amp;A so all of you newbies to this
channel can get to know me a little bit
better this video may seem like a very
narcissistic video and that's because it
is however I just want you guys to get
to know me and feel like you genuinely
know me so I was also out with video
ideas but will not speak about that
I'm going to rock this video a little
bit differently I'm going to first of
all so some basic facts about me that
you got it all and if you want to look
like any longer this year value old
general facts that's fine
skip to this time here and that will be
straight to the Q&amp;amp;A for this Q&amp;amp;A I asked
you guys to tweet me with the hashtag
ask me leaky on Twitter annual did if
you haven't followed me on Twitter yet
use my Twitter
I'll be doing more communities in the
future this is my first Q&amp;amp;A in Valliere
it's a quick fire round
I'm sixteen turning 17 on September the
16th which means I'm a Virgo
my favorite color is great as you can
probably see my favorite food I'll
pancake panel chocolate and chicken Kiev
my main hobbies first of all YouTube
obviously I also love boxing I have done
martial arts basically on my life but
currently I am like teaching myself
carved martyr because there's no classes
that do it near me Google if you don't
know auditive sir today is thinking I
like contemplating life of the meaning
of it why we're here
I also love the universe things I hate
people who are easily offended basically
mostly for me internet being poke your
not poke me I hate having my bellybutton
touched and I hate boring people as well
I like to think I'm generally quite
funny my friends I am
bidelman Kay having YouTube videos
because my team Li goes off all the
people needing to be there because I
like comment on what they say and stuff
I also the job so maybe probably a bit
much the internet and people get
offended
I'm very weird and I'm not saying I like
oh I'm so we needed to stamps out of
nowhere like I'm actually worrying leave
weird and I will admit to that the
amount of times I've done something and
to see that response people have given
me numerous
you're actually so weird I'm used to it
as I say really the quick sidenote
outside appeal box
I've just received my first batch of
mail every single thing I get in my PA
box is going up on my wall if you ever
want to send me anything just write it
on the back of the envelope starting
from the military and I will be see
there I always hold them on my Twitter
and snapchat I will be doing anyway
what's the most embarrassing fresh
awkward woman you've experienced so far
I haven't hatched where has that man
just because I don't usually get
embarrassed like I normally embarrass
myself on purpose the laughs probably
when I placed myself in Lightyear for I
was filming a water bottle to the car
Castle I'm going to wet myself and I did
one of them to this wonderful warrant
and you just ask a really good questions
I'm going for all credly rejected
someone up being awkwardly rejected if
I've ever rejected someone and I only
get all close because I'm just normal
like up front of our an alliance you
know I don't feel like I have to explain
myself like rather than we might all
have a boyfriend which I have them in
past but Luke and I have been awkwardly
rejected right
I was on holiday and I'm real excited
this guy and I thought that he might be
slightly interested in me just because
he was with his dad we were in the
poorest of himself turnarounds like
what's your names I told him my name as
I million is daddy black oh okay my son
wanted to know and his son was like dad
I can't believe you two still maps not
denying it or anything
I don't know just a few little things
which led me to believe that it might be
remotely interested so I went up to him
and I just threw everything to the side
and I went over to him and it went high
and I had talked to him for a while
briefly and I was like hi I just really
like one night you wanted to go out or
like me and do something and he was like
oh oh
well I'm with my family so I don't
really know what we're doing
it's like every night so well our liking
although now it's just like to get along
another good smell nice anything
remotely shop what are you oh god I've
loved it I loved it I couldn't feel that
I said what are your views on marijuana
I think it's a and I leave many cases
currently
legal hell I say legalize I don't see
how government could legalize cigarettes
and alcohol but made marijuana illegal
when when look at how many people
alcohol and cigarettes have killed
compared to marijuana zero hundreds of
thousands do some research like probably
do some research and you will 110 come
to the same conclusion biggest regret in
life ask Michael pal avocado I don't
think you should have any regrets in
life because when I think back to every
side thing that has happened in my life
that bad thing has led to a chain of
events which has made something even
better come out at the end so example is
I've ever for an hour like an ex best
friend years ago me falling out with
them has led to a chain of events as we
meet new people which is eventually led
to meeting their senses Kirsti who is
absolutely amazing and I couldn't leave
anyone's the best better best friends
with so that's why I don't regret having
an argument with that person years ago
for example all the regrets do have in
life is when I'm like probably shouldn't
be in that probably just consumed my
entire recommended calorie intake in a
5-minute fitting this one were a few
like so I'm going to answer it through
why do I drop everything in my videos
I'm going to I play songs to got a few
likes you should a crush or just a cross
in general youtuber crush without a
doubt question Dolan and six I've
watched more of these videos and like
become more familiar with his
personality I think I was having too so
spontaneous I will be some Dolan as well
they are both so attractive religious
notion about Grayson and he thought
spontaneous as well like new today he
went abroad like a week just for a
YouTube video and it's like that's what
I want to do in my life I'll read off
every single leaf I'm going to be a
serenity to this year as well just in
case any of you are going I'm going to
be there hi how old were you when you
got your first period um I never wrote
down the date or anything I'd almost
outsite what people do like remember the
day when you started but I think I was
about maybe 14 I think I was so I was
quite wait I was never worried I would
make the most of it I was like yeah
I have so many questions on the door
when Prince I don't know why I get so
many explain your first case in detail
my first kiss was when I was 15 on
holiday when I was 12 sorry table to
death but I got that day like five times
in a row and we both liked each other
and we admitted to it already

actual prom dress not three dollar ones

fake makeups coming soon and some more
dresses for a different kind but you
actually will be new folks coming to my
absolutely loves working and you guys
can be such good feedback on them so it
just makes me feel so long
are you a hillside power slap type heels
always without a doubt this is a really
personal one will answer anyway yeah he
asks if you're in zombie apocalypse what
many would you get from McDonald's if it
was the last time to eat from that I
would get what I've always had from
McDonald's without sales 650 nuggets and
9 chicken nuggets and fries with a large
diet coke to explodes ketchup and salt
not barbecue dis regular tomato ketchup
have you ever been arrested or had to
run from the police decor
you know another police otherwise it'd
just be they never actually come up not
with the police and only people's ever
had to run from all I've been confronted
by and with then one from it security
guards change of background apologies
when are you releasing your pops office
as soon as possible
I've tried signing myself as poor hours
and hours and hours of effort into
designing them many of which I have
scrapped I think I have a design idea I
just need to cartoonish by myself which
I'm going to try and do on Photoshop
beef with other youtubers
here's a quick story that happen with
another youtuber and it's still annoys
me and we were pretty close we talked a
lot so we used to message all the time
stuff and I always had like more
subscribers and hurt or just asking for
advice and organize give it to a light
with growing a channel and then she
wasn't many subscribers I messaged her
and she didn't reply I managed her again
she open didn't reply and I was like
this bit and then I overtook her in
subscribers I'm gonna mine she's like a
year later she
pops up like hey girls I want to
collapse no not really
what you want to be when you're older
and you still do acting and when I'm
older I would love to do eautiful turn
that is an ultimate goldmine ally are
nothing I would want more just to
dedicate my life to YouTube after acting
I don't act so much anymore
I would have loved to I had like a few
items here and there but those are
talents being like an audition every
week but I think it's now is because of
my age I wouldn't be able to do what any
action wolf could I have exams coming up
do you have a boyfriend if you do how
long before and no I don't have a
boyfriend I never had what I would count
anyway like I've had a new relationship
sort of lasted like months or two months
sort of I don't really count man I like
this one how do you juggle school and
YouTube what's the real you to the life
how am i juggle school on YouTube is
getting more difficult now that I will
always prioritize YouTube I am still
revising and working on it in school but
if I had like three hours I'd finish
piece of homework or get other your
college I'd get a video uploaded using
no doubt about it what's the real
youtuber life and I'm going to take a
few points and obsessively keeping track
of your analysis on how your videos are
doing instructed so you know what's
working out or what's not I must check
my attics multiple times a day like 20
times a day staying up until 4 o'clock
in the morning editing videos and then
having to be up at about 12 o'clock the
next day to film the video if you use
natural light so I get quite difficult
and you wake up looking a bit under the
weather with your eye bags people asking
for shoutouts
constantly getting to Friday and being
like I should probably find a video for
tomorrow and then not being able to go
out and buy things that is very
frustrating yeah oh my god that was a
very very long Q&amp;amp;A I'm going to stop
there so uh let me know if you feel like
you know me more is it first in your
opinion on anything I said that would be
amazing
see my next video might be to do in eBay
who knows
have a beautiful day and live life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
