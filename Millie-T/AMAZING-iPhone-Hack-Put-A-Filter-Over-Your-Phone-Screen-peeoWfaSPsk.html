want to quickly share with you a I phone
hack that I found out the other day
actually and I've never ever seen this
hack anywhere before so hopefully it'll
be something new to you I'm only going
to the video but it basically puts a
filter over your phone it's really hard
to explain but you'll get the gist of it
want to give it a go so just go on to
settings on your phone scroll up so you
get these search bar on settings and
search in settings display then on the
top of the screen what should come up is
display accommodations and then under
that in really small text General
accessibility vision click on that and
you should get a screen up with invert
colors color filters and reduce
whitepoint on so all you need to do is
go on to a cool filters and you should
get any page with loads of different
colored pencils on switch color filters
on you will see all the options you get
so you can put your phone into grayscale
and then if you go off settings your
whole phone is black and white which is
amazing
you can go red or green which basically
brings out a lot of Pink's makes your
greens extremely vivid as well then the
green and red filter is the exact same
but just reverse everything if you do
get a different effect your blues are
extremely deep and your greens are more
bright luminous yellow any quantity blue
or yellow filter and your blues are
extremely extremely deep now and your
greens are extremely vivid so if you
want a a extremely vivid color spectrum
you want to go onto the blue slash
yellow filter or something else you can
also do is if you scroll down right to
the bottom you can change the intensity
so you can make it slightly intense but
you can go all the way up make it
extremely intense so the colors show and
the color payoff and pigmentation in the
colors is massive you can also want to
pull it in and once you've gone through
Cullerton you should have like a filter
of your screen then scroll down go into
hue if you play with a hue bar your
phone become different colors it'll go
and you know red pink green blue purple
pink again
it's not very practical but if you just
want to have a play around you fall and
see the different filters and colors and
watch youtube videos in black and white
even then give it a go I saw this really
cool share with you and I hope you learn
something new and I hope you've not
heard this before so quick little fill a
video I hope you enjoyed it have a
beautiful day and don't forget stay
posted and also subscribe if you learned
something new from this bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
