channel called ask Millie and it's gonna
be asking Millie I'm sold one Episode
two so three I will be uploaded every
Friday night I'm and I will answer some
questions I videos will be about five
minutes long I'd say so let's get
started
yeah video time
any makeup um like I was i I was asking
for Christmas for my family and stuff
for makeup and yeah it was makeup mainly
um brands Maybelline Rimmel and then
high-end Mac benefit I'm in DK NYX old
Nick sword I don't get it much over here
and elf Nick's and alpha thanks
if ever I get a gift from anyone the
like thing that I'd hope for the most
depending on a rude person was and
things like that if it was really good
friend then I like cute things like your
DIY the DIYs that lived on themselves
oh I do not want usual things like
Cookie Monster and just Jen and I lucky
chandelier and I keep they putting you
look at I was just amazing like I were
one of them if I just hang with you look
and it's like a million other time when
I get school again I need to completely
decorate my locker making nice-looking
my favorite food is chocolate cake and
peppermint sauce thank you for asking
that
good question really really good
question my favorite makeup brand is
definitely Mac benefit or Urban Decay
because they're just amazing Mac because
it's high-end very popular and the
products are just great
a girl always relying it the coverage
and benefit been mainly because of the
packaging and their eyebrow products and
then urban decay because their mascaras
and the naked palettes who doesn't like
making palettes I believe and my snake
eyes
I had a little gymnastics to start off
with and I want to share that with
people so I did videos and then I ran
out of ideas to do with gymnastic so I
moved on to Beauty where there is an
endless amount of ideas and I are doing
beauty videos people had inspired me
with probably light so well and people
like that and yeah I am doing ever since
just like a Leslie
most nights bribe me to make youtube
videos were definitely Cookie Monster
because of her personality that was
similar to mine bethany mota because of
how good she was with her videos Zoila
and Beauty crush because they are
British and then they're my four main
ones and then I have other ones that I
like that I like to watch i subscribe to
i watch their videos every now and again
when it appears in my newsfeed and
there's just a lot of amazing people on
YouTube
I favorite foundation ever my number one
foundation is definitely benefit hello
flawless foundation it's amazing gives
you great coverage and then my favorite
J drugstore foundation will probably be
Rimmel match perfection because I have
had two of them now and haven't had any
problems with them and they do give you
a little bit of coverage which is great
for school because you don't look cakey
a favorite store to shop at is probably
new look because it's not too expensive
but then the clothes and things to get a
really good quality they do fit in with
my fashion style and I also love River
Island for their accessories and backs
Rimmel or Maybelline two main ones we
mail because he had an under five pound
sale stuff but like all orders a lot of
set up so I collected them and it
Maybelline because what if they bring
out becomes really popular and babe make
baby lips and color tattoos they're the
two main ones I think
nudes I love nude Pink's nude Pink's are
good the natural just exaggerated a
little your lipstick makes it look
perfect so definitely nude pink that
assumed if my ask Millie for week one so

it in the video give you a shout-out and
whatnot
