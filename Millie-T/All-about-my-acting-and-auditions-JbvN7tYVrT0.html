did my voice just break then I was naked
bit what today's video is going to be on
all about my acting now our kind of
contemplating whether to make this video
or not because I know that a lot of you
might click on this a girl oh my god
she's bragging but no a lot of requests
I basically the only reason that I'm
doing out and no lost YouTube you say
that blouse because it's true but before
I start this video I do have a request
so I'm going to be calling my viewers or
my millions in a future video that's
probably like this weekend something
like that and so if you do want to be
featured in that video then please send
me your numbers and through my email
which is listed here and I'll just be
bringing you on your phones and it'll be
guaranteed than having you as well so
I'm just ringing everyone who sends with
their number so yeah first question
asked was in one of the comments in my
Q&amp;amp;A video so I'm just gonna answer it
now what to do you actin I've been in
background for shameless CBBC programmes
like the backgrounds for it been called
for carnation Street but obvious but why
don't school but obviously when it's not
obvious at all so I've been called for
carnations Street boy I've been on
holiday and I've done Last Tango in
Halifax and Anthony and clear like that
honestly I can't remember everything
that I've been in for the background but
there's been quite a few because you
just get called in for that no auditions
or anything well then for the main parts
at home of the deep Manor parts for the
films I've only been in that once and
right now for this week next week up
until August I'm going to be doing I am
doing a double for someone and I'm going
to try and explain it to you what that
is and we do get a private tutor as well
so it's not as if I'm just to kind of
lesson some school or anything and but
that's the end of that question now the
next question was how do I get started
with acting I always get really
conscious about this look it's going
real
so how do I get started well don't do
not go online I would not recommend
recommend that if you have gone online
and then you've been successful from
that then congratulations that's that's
great but whenever I try and do
something online it's always a scam or
there's always something in tiny Texan
like sighs - so you never know what it
says but the way that I did it started
drama group if you want to do performing
arts and start a theater workshop group
and then if you want to do TV even start
a TV group well it won't be called TV
glue but it'll be around that median
you'll read on the website something
like that
and and then you're eventually be booked
into the agency
from there you'll have your picture
taken and if someone's looking for a
part they'll go hey can um well this
general overdue hey can you put out
forward a girl I want a girl that's got
blond hair gray eyes is five foot two
and has braces and then they'd put my
picture forward and then if there were
four of the girls that looked like that
then they would put four of the girls
forward as well so they'd have five in
total and then they'd pick out of them
or the take all of them um for an
audition the dog dish in you if you got
the part the dream I'll go
congratulations you got the part or you
go back for a callback and keep doing
that and or you would just they just
take one and for being a double and
background you don't have to audition
because it's mainly for looks for that
one next question what it's the pay like
I saw the pay for background work it can
I can't tell you exactly because
anatomic ranges from the company company
but the production team and but it can
be 15 to 40 pounds generally speaking
and 40 pounds is very rare to get for
this I'm getting paid well I'm not I'm
not supporting artists for the spotting
artists or the extras on the background
workers they get paid thirty pounds for
this and if you're over sixteen doing it
you get paid 60 pounds it's always half
the main part um depends how many days
you do but a week if it works by a week
probably like five hundred six hundred
seven hundred three hundred a week it
really
depends and what I'm doing now I think
I'm not 100% but I think it's 50 pounds
a day
so basically good that's it's good for
and it is it kind of quite easy depends
all the days like some time to call you
on some time to hang it around for a lot
but if for a long time but if you are
going to do this kind of thing then
definitely definitely definitely bring a
book you phone you can know your iPad
your iPod music player anything to keep
you entertained
do not bring nothing because you will be
bored out of your mind just sitting
there you bum all her you'll start
counting sheep in your head and I'll be
boring
the next question is what do you do if
you go to an audition and you fail to be
honest you'll go to launch auditions
you're not going to get every single
auditions and for acting don't just
think if you don't get an audition oh my
god I'm a terrible actor I'm absolutely
terrible I'm gonna give up now and I'm
gonna go to be toilet cleaner when you
go for an audition and you don't get it
it can easily be because they want
someone fat they want someone incredibly
skinny they want someone blonde with
blond hair they want someone with brown
hair I don't know I can be anything
you've absolutely anything or maybe they
want someone who's and who's black or
maybe you want someone who's white it
depends what kind of family they want to
fit in and if you don't fit if they've
already cast the mom and dad and you
don't look like the mom or the dad so I
safe there mom and dad are both African
and you're there and you're British and
and English then it's gonna it's not
gonna look natural when you're then
it'll confuse a lot of people and
another thing I won't fit audition for
Happy Valley that's been on TV in the UK
and the reason I didn't get it was
because I was - I was like a year older
but I looked older than 13 so I looked
like I don't know how old they thought I
look for and a lot older than I was and
a lot older to fit the part even more so
but you did bring love and he did say
that it was fantastic audition and it
was just the age unfortunately which is
not something that a directors do a lot
so you will get compliments like that
along the way so if you feel an audition
you know something might come around
okay so I've been talking for long
enough now the videos like 60 minutes 30
seconds long something like that so um
I'm gonna end the video there thank you
guys so so
watching you all mean the absolute world
to me and don't get to me your numbers
through your email through my email yeah
if you're still watching and comment any
cook comment any comment with the word
cookie in it but make sure it's wanted
to comment so hey Millard you like
cookies ain't really what kind what is
your favorite flavor of cooking thank
you for watching I love you all goodbye
