okay so I says finally here but I wasn't
expecting it it was a Christmas present
and this isn't the Christmas present
there is some stuff inside it but em I
have some American chocolate from
American shop here and it's a massive
handset then I got Christmas so it's
right here
I'm so excited okay so I actually
haven't looked inside it yet because I
thought I'd save it out and it just on
Christmas and that's really depressing
is morning of the 26th of December I'll
be uploading this video a bit late to
them but if I open it up oh whoa oh oh
gee oh wow so I think you got it from
the shop in the Andale Center which is
American and American sweet shop and if
you can't really tell from my accent I'm
not from America so and I'm British so
if you're from America then yes I may
seem weird doing this video because I
love everything American okay so um I'll
just go through everything oh my god it
looks so good
I'm definitely watching a film and
eating this tonight so I will show you
what's in it first so first I have the
cookies and cream bites and and
apparently it's new like that Oh dry out
all the yummy flavors chocolate chip
cookie dough bites dark chocolate cookie
dough bites peanut butter cookie dough
bites foot brownie cookie dough bites
mint chocolate chip cookie dough bites
cinnamon bun by it's all cinnamon I love
cinnamon so that's what it looks like Oh
lol of cookie dough okay
next I'll go through the Hirsch's
Hershey's candy cane mint can do with
candy bits I don't know how that is
going to be so that's that candy cane
nice fitting with Christmas but
Christmas is over really depressing okay
so the other Hershey's all cookies and
cream I've had that before
Hershey's cookies and cream it's
absolutely amazing and a lot of British
people absolutely hate American
chocolate and I love Dairy Milk really
elf Jeremy
Cadbury's so I think everyone in England
loves the cookies-and-cream one the well
the majority of people including me I
love it so next I have the Hershey's mr.
Goodbar made with chocolate and peanuts
that's all right I like mr. Goodbar and
comment any of these which is your
favorite and I just feel I'm really
interested we've got a few drinks in
here Reese's sticks made with chocolate
peanut butter and crispy Retton wafers
Oh Reese it's not rageous Quincy peanuts
peanut butter creamy caramel and
chocolate flavor coating whoa okay hmm
Wow this I know this one is very popular
in America well I think it is Moon Moon
Pie the original marshmallow sandwich
banana or not Nicolai banana now I'm not
too keen on banana but the foods food
foods good green pie and that's what it
looks like
I think this is popular in America but
I'm not too sure butterfingers pieces in
milk chocolate pumpkin know what that is
I'll do the drinks last next we have a
hostess it's like a Twinkie apparently
it's almost exactly like a Twinkie and
please comment below know what this is
because I think it's a hostess but I
don't trust the company or not and if
you from America don't laugh at me
because I'm British and I don't have a
clue about this by the way I love
Twinkies so if it is I'll be I'll be
after next i veces a fast break milk
chocolate peanut butter and new gasps no
gasps look it's new gasps OH
that's what it looks like a milk
chocolate peanut butter new guys yeah so
that looks quite good it looks like you
should double there as well so you know
that would be really good
okay next I think that's it's the food
part from one thing oh my god fat white
fudge-covered pet pretzels now they look
good right okay
take a guess that's how much they cost
right
in England British Pound is a little bit
less than dollars like if it's savory or
something under ten pounds it'd be like
say 5p or five cents difference I'm not
too sure what yet just take a guess
right now how much you think that cost
and I'll tell you at the end Cruz apps
it's so expensive for that like I think
is because you have to pay the shipping
cost as well but I don't know
anyway the drinks I have NW cream soda
made with aged vanilla nice we have
cream soda over here it's actually very
popular but and this one I've never
really heard I've never heard of n NW
and hopefully this will be better to
smoke himself Oh
Mountain Dew game fuel cuz um apparently
I get a bit high for when I have
anything that's to do with energy drinks
I also do all climbing up the walls and
I do I'm proud of it now I love being
high because you feel free and loose and
it's good okay so now the hamper is
empty and I will use this to publish
store my most used makeup probably I
don't know yeah all my body spray tan do
urgent well some of them because I don't
think they'll all fit in there so yeah
now time to tell you how much this was
right for packet of these about size of
your head and it was 5 pounds or $4.99
if you want to be picky that is that's
about 5 dollars 50 that is
dyma mind blown
hi there right Fujiko pretzels right and
throw in one now my smell really good so
kind of looks like it an alien all
scream from the movie I never had one
before
I never had a pretzel mmm now I can
understand the price I can mmm you've
paid pretty four pounds through the air
how much other is in that house how many
freckles rolling up
Stuart you have to try the white fudge
covered pretzels yeah the five quid oh
yeah didn't think I think they like a
weird blue cheese taste one for the off
the edge to that oh yeah
they are really good our name down
really good mom I know she'll steal them
or if you're in England go to Manchester
on deals and get these if you're in
America then you're so lucky to have
these for a cheap price hmm see you
