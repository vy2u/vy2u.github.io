sure or maybe April worked full box
unboxing now I am really really excited
tool box this is to my first time doing
an unboxing video for the wantable so I
am very very excited and I'm not quite
sure what to expect so let's get into
this okay so first of all as you can see
I have a white box and the ones that I
see normally black and so I might have
the April 1 I know that the March onto
black oh let's get into it I think I've
already ruined it
ok so when you first open it you have a
positive one over here and it's a it's a
beautiful new thing now so it's not I
look about wantable is that you
personalize it to your own liking
so on the website I'll go through a
bunch of questions with you what cool is
you prefer won't you like and nude
colors do you like me lay out their
colors what kind of girls do you like
you prefer pressed eyeshadows loose
eyeshadows so let's see how well they
did it matching it up and it saves here
and when you open it it you've got it
says smile beautiful and I'm a composer
like this because I needed this
thumbnail so that's why so anyway you
might wrinkle box oh this is going to
tell me everything nuts in here and
pretty jaws so I'm just just in case I'm
not gonna have a look then it's got a
little foam packaging at the top to keep
it safe then first of all is to in
package a peace peaceful eyebrow tools
eyebrow tool kits in case but this is
very useful ok this is very very good so
far I did put in that I did want things
for my eyebrows because obviously I
loved in it thinks about my eyebrows and
it looks like oh it's a really really
nice pocket
and then it's got everything that it
includes in it and for this one you've
got tweezers and then a comb and
scissors like this and that is so cute
and I am definitely looking forward to
trying these out oh yeah that's the same
thing there and also I have a flat lip
pencil by Lakha
&amp;amp; Co and she who cares wins and it is in
the color oh god that's a very cheap
chilli pencil I take it this is like one
that you can fill in so you know he just
bitten kissable lip stains by Maybelline
New York I think how these are quite
similar to them and I will do some
swatches for you now okay so how would
you really say that I wasn't really free
of the net with the color of this
product so first of all it looks as if
it's gonna be a really strong radiant
color and then it's really really sheer
but it honestly does last which is very
surprising but I'm just really not a fan
of the color I love bold vibrant colors
it smells pretty good and it kind of
smells like food which is never about
smell so I'll definitely try that one
out all the prices should be displayed
down here and this is in the color
family blood if in case you were curious
also I have this eye eyeliner I think it
is yet an eyeliner which is something I
all request I requested first of all let
me say that the packaging is gorgeous
it's so sleek as to the products itself
it does took a bit when you put it on
your eyes but the color payoff is
absolutely amazing and I would
definitely recommend this product if you
do not mind this tube labelled a doctor
and linear mineral a natural and I'm
it's a brown color and obviously Bishop
of obvious becomes sharp and the
packaging is very sleek so I'm
definitely looking forward to trying
this one out so this is the last thing
and I have a eyes shadow I'm pretty sure
it is by
plae beauty something else that I like
about this product is that it is very
very very pigmented and not chalky at
all
I'm definitely looking forward to trying
that one out never heard of the brand
but all the prices should be listed
below and then what the Box cost and
everything like that
and how much you saved okay yeah
basically saved or how much and money
sweats you get out of it so yeah I'm
pretty impressed with this box and
you've got everything that I requested
for they definitely don't pay anything
that you don't want in there which is
definitely a positive personal like
people complain when they get things
that they don't want in boxes because
obviously if you don't want it then you
don't want it but I'm definitely
definitely excited for this box and so
again I've got a lip pencil eye pencil
eye shadow and a brow kit so one two
three four yeah you get and any
additional information will be displayed
down here in the screen on over here
well across the whole screen wherever I
decide to put it and when I'm editing
the Brocade I will definitely use this
gorgeous pocket the pack packaging the
lip pencil I will definitely use the
eyeliner pencil and yeah I don't see why
not I mean it I don't really tend to use
Browns but I'm sure it'll come in handy
for one point if I decide that I like
that color mole and then also the brown
neutral eyeshadow I do love as well and
I just want to try that one out so I did
ask for vibrant colors as well that was
one of the options and but I said
because what you do is you rate it hot
or not kind well kind of like that you
put a scale and of whether you like or a
little bit I'll hate it so foundation
took it hated foundations you go no and
it's guaranteed that you will not get
that in your box but if you love pressed
powders then you put yes and the more
higher you rate it the more chance it it
has of
being included in this box so I really
really excited this box and it's it
looks great and I would definitely
recommend it if you are interested in
getting so I'm impressed
and if you don't see review or anything
on any of these products here then just
comment below if you are still watching

Cowell in it in capitals just so I know
Oh actually doesn't have to be capped so
I'll just put it in as a word whatever
