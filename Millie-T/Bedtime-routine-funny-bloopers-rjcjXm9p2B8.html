requested video which is my bedtime
routine so let's get going with that
okay so first I walk into my room
obviously as you can see I'm not gonna
like complain to my remember so I also
make sure that my bedroom door is fully
closed because I love it when it's
closed next I just have a look around my
room pick up anything on the floor that
doesn't mean to be there so it's nice
and tidy and I just put it back in a
suitable place where it should go and
also I have bedspreads that need to go
on so I just pop them on the mummer
next I like to up all my candles because
I love feeling really relaxed and
everything in my room and so yeah we're
gonna watch it in a little fast motion
so we can be all cool and everything so
yeah that's cool I also turn off all my
lights and turn on my favorite lights
because I think it just makes me so
relaxed and I'm to top that off I just
for me any unwanted pillows and cushions
off my bed so I can easily lie down into
them sorry I'll just crap my local bear
sorry so yeah and get rid of everything
I also have a hot water bottle that I am
warm up during the night Simon England
and it's always really cold and I hate
anything good I want to live in America
I also just peel back my bed just so I
know it's really ready for me to sit
into when I get back so I clean off all
my makeup ready for my bath
using simple lights so I take one off
and one normally gets with my full
makeup when I use different parts so
I'll take off my eye makeup first and I
have a lot of makeup that left on the
white and it doesn't really look good
but I need makeup as do it well and
you'd makeup but a lot of girls use
makeup as well so I'm not weird okay I
am weird
yeah I'm weird really weird so I just
like take all the makeup off for my eyes
so I normally put on the Naked 2 palette
and some mascara if you want see some
tutorials from The Naked 2 palette then
please like this video so I know and
also you will probably want to subscribe
if you're not already so you know when
it's out
so yeah just let me take all my makeup
with the white because I enjoy doing
that um and I also get running myself a
bath because I absolutely love this
Beach I have all my products there at
the back that I use because my brother's
a little bit and that's my section so I
use strawberry living wash
it's about it's up from ends bar and
I'll just pour that into the bath to
make it nice and Bobby don't let your
mother be back
also notice quickly show you the
products I use I use Ossie miracle my
shampoo for my hair as a base like
shampoo and it smells really nice
okay I'm weird html's like bubblegum and
old bubblegum you haven't already tried
it out and you need to get it cuz if you
don't then oh my god I also used oddly
cool about shampoo just basically
exaggerated to color in your hair and my
hair is obviously blond as you can see a
nice to pull a blind then you probably
think it's purple I'm not dumb I know
that's not how color blindness works I
also use coconut shampoo that smells
really nice cuz I'm obsessed with
coconut because coconuts amazing I know
a lot of people hate coconut but I love
bounties and stuff I just stabbed myself
at the nose for their that's nice and
their nice little addition to it it's
also I'm new boyfriend so yeah he can
see us on our wedding day there I also
use dove and body wash and coconut and
spa two as another body wash that that
one doesn't go in the bath - he needs it
for either off and then I also get
undressed but I'm not gonna do a video
on that because I'd be really would and
then that wouldn't go on this kind of
website yeah I'm gonna stop it there so
that's me after my bath looking really
really sexy as you can see they're a
little turban on and everything and I
absolutely hate my hair I wanted to come
out the show it's all wavy and curly and
disgusting but anyway I get changing
right into my pajamas next little magic
and and it's meet you one day that I
really like
and it was from new look so that's it
and then I start posing because I like
posing
I also light an oil burner in my room to
have the oil burner and plate light the
tea light places to you light in it get
the scent you won and pop these sentence
in the top area that's kind of round and
as you can see me doing that now undo
the lid and then pull it in and then you
also add water and that just really
helps me sleep and it smells really good
so that's it when the lights are off and
I really like it next I took myself into
bed like so and I've put my candles next
to me and I use my HP Pavillion
touchscreen laptop that supports Windows
8 and I basically go on apps on that and
YouTube and basically watch YouTube
videos oh my god it's Bethany multi I
absolutely love Bethany Mota she's
amazing as everyone knows that who she
is because she's got like 4 million
subscribers and beauty crush I totally
look beautiful she's British and I'm
well happy with that is contagious she's
finished yeah hey that's my happy face
and she's just so gorgeous
I want hair like her I also watched so
Eller because she's weird like me and I
love zoella she's just amazing she's got
about the same subscribers as Bethany
Mota apart from it a little bit more so
you're probably know who she is I
absolutely love it she's weird like I
said before beautiful and she's also
British so there's nothing wrong without
I also checked through my Twitter's you
can see int bethany mota holiday
giveaway glow my facial expressions when
I can't talk I don't know what to do my
face also edit my videos put thumbnails
on and I look through all the comments I
have as you can see I've fast forward
them because it's just so many looks
forward to reading when I get tired from
being on YouTube a lot I don't get time
for being on YouTube I just feel tired
I'll put my computer down I'll also blow
out my candles and blow out my oil
burner as well because I don't want my
room sitting afraid because I'll be bad
and then I turn the lights off so I'll
hear my bloopers
I'm good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
