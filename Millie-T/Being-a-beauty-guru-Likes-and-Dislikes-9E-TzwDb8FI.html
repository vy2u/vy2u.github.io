it this is a planning I've done for this
video
anywho on with the actual video now this
is all about being a beauty guru things
that I like and dislike I have this
section here
it's loves and this one here is hates
the first thing that I love about being
on YouTube and one stuff with the lost
is all the amazing subscribers you have
that is such an amazing thing
obviously the subscribes is what makes
me and what the channel is so that is
why subscribers are my number one
priority when it comes to YouTube I mean
they obviously are if you have no
subscribers then what's point in making
videos really I mean I suppose you will
get video views but it's just really not
the same the second thing that I love
about being a beauty guru is meeting
people so maybe not actually meeting
them in person I but like meeting them
over the internet and like other
youtubers that I have talked to
absolutely loads of youtubers over the
internet most of them with the same
amount of subscribers as me cuz that's
just small kind of substantial and just
easier um but it's just amazing to meet
new people over the incident obviously
you know that they are genuine you know
that they're not gonna be weird but I
mean I love them I've met are weird but
not a bad kinda weird I said me weird
next number three is filming a video
I just love filming videos like just
sitting down talking because whenever I
talk to you much my friends or my mom
you just go should I be talking too much
but with you guys you guys you
understand that I need to talk other
thing number four is the event to go to
I just
I haven't personally been to one myself
yet because this like VidCon and
beautycon and IMAX and things like that
but they're all all in London I live
near Berlin near Manchester so yeah it's
pretty difficult to get down to London
but I'm sure when I gain more
subscribers and kind of get to a long I
mean I I'm I'm obviously very happy with
the number of subscribers I have now
bought Emmy
to kind of fit in with VidCon and music
on an IMAX and things like that
I obviously I'll have to have a bit more
subscribers and then I can actually meet
you guys what actor beast that would
personally make me go down to London is
to meet my subscribers most of all
because that's the main thing that I
would care about me in you guys number
five is all the nice comments you get so
like literally I just uploaded a video
about five minutes ago about makeup for
Valentine's Day and there were three
come on comments on there so I was kind
of give them a shout-out as well of so
amberlynn commented I love your vids and
that's just that's shows that they watch
my other videos which is a massive
compliment all in all then America love
she's a subscribe that's up in F in the
beginning and she was literally one of
my first subscribers and she's always
been there coming to the normal videos
liking all my videos being a subscriber
so America love if you're watching this
which you probably are thank you so much
for that because x xax x commented you
are so pretty
and just sighs that's just a massive
compliment and it just really does make
me smile number six as i mention quite a
lot is reputable always come back and
always comment on my videos that if you
do commit on my videos a lot that don't
thing that you've not been there unseen
because I always know it's that you
comment on all my videos
crafty Holly you comment on all my
videos America love you comment on all
my videos and there are ambling you've
just recently style commenting and a lot
of my videos and this just obviously I
can't name the morgue so I'll quite a
few but it's just amazing to see like
that people are keeping past back
because it shows that my videos aren't
as boring as I think it's seen how many
views you have so like coming after
dancing how many for you to video Scott
I'm just really prevailing that so
that's just another little thing that I
like and the thing is just kinda
interacting with companies now because
of YouTube I've been able to kind of do
kind of and like receive products and
mainly to review and that's just an
amazing thing I do I wish to tell the
companies like um don't expect me to
kind of comment to kind of go say oh I
love that product so much because
obviously I will if I do
but I'm not going to lie so who keeps
any products or so I'll get to keep that
product because no matter what I say in
that with you I will still get to keep
the product so it doesn't matter
next it's having a peel box now I don't
have a peel box personally but I've seen
other youtubers have peel boxes and it's
just a fact that people that watch their
videos and subscribers have took the
time out of their day to just basically
send them a letter and a handwriting and
decorate it and just ship it or send it
and that's just really that's that's
just amazing because you can keep it
free I'll do a video on that like here's
my PO Box but for now it's gonna have to
stick to YouTube now it's on to the
things that I don't like about being a
rich girl of basically the first thing
is hey now over the hey game videos
every single beat screw every single
youtuber will get hate nobody not
everyone's gonna love ya if they do love
you then you have got something special
but not everyone is going to love you on
YouTube you're going to get some hey got
a move on my life and realize that this
more lovers and haters next is editing I
hate editing my videos down so you
should expect you beat all of anything
but I hate it I hate it
. hate it what's up I use Windows Movie
Maker to edit excite windows and then
move makeup on that is just amazing it's
kind of updated and I think aren't you
sure but it is an amazing thing for
editing your videos like it's so easy to
use and it's so simple and I just love
it for that reason basically it takes me
seven hours two days to make a video one
video this video will take me two days
filming this video on the 4th of
February and it will probably be
uploaded on the fifth or the sixth it's
all the third thing is I think every
beauty guru kind of feels down about not
having as many subscribers or views or
comments or likes or whatever bethany
mota she's got a tall boss she's getting
12 oz to go around and meet her fans at
all boss
I didn't tour bus with bethany mota
across the front and now it's like girl
hmm
but she just know how she does realize
how lucky she is and it's just amazing
really next thing I hate would you
something that doesn't happen quite a
lot but it so does the nine
it's when your video deletes itself went
after you've entered it and I went in
this before but you want me to maker and
you say and you think you save your
video your exit here
and then suddenly you go on to any video
stop there most of the next thing is
watching better video than you now I
know I know I don't have the best camera
ever I know that my I just I think to
ourselves my videos are so so crap
compared to theirs I don't know I just
think to myself well obviously bethany
mota turns your hand and all these other
really famous youtubers they have been
on their YouTube channel for five and
over years so they have obviously had a
lot of time to improve on talking to the
camera videoing editing and things like
that so anything to ourselves I've only
been on it for a year I've got time to
improve and also it's Howard dick did
you get to YouTube
I first thing I do after school I'm like
yes I'm going YouTube see how many
notifications I've got check my inbox
check comments on my videos watch all
the videos from people I've subscribed
to and giveaway winners and things like
that and also that's just you get
addicted
finally is when you contact it's someone
with more subscribers than you and they
don't reply now obviously I know I keep
using these an example but they're the
most subscribed to beauty gurus and like
so we show up on a Metheny more to like
it's fair enough with them because
honestly they just they will get over a
thousand inboxes and emails a day and
they can't reply to them also I don't
think they'd really even read my message
because there's just so many to read but
something that Bethany does which I
truly appreciate flash well do that with
me just which I really appreciate when
everyone sends out pillbox she applies
to every single one of them and in one
of her videos she goes this is the box I
got and then she like tips it out onto
the floor with all the letters and
packages and they're all like mmm loose
and she's like they have you playing to
them all I don't just think that's
really nice daddy said obviously I do on
this video - you really really love
you know it probably is but I just want
to make it show as possible but I do
want to make it detailed for those of
you who were wondering comments what
your most valued point is there so what
point you agree with most or you would
agree with I'm gonna go now because I
need a wee</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
