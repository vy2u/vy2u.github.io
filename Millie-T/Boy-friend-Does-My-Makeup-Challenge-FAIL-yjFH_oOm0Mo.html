makeup we are not together

makes you less help there you go you're
smart under doing it you do I'm still
like this if it won't no I can't have it
go the wall I'm right so why I just
listed
I don't know where this goes not on my
eyebrow it's on your eyebrow John
Gitomer
hmm this thing right that looks
appropriate
yeah I'll zoom it all those right
okay so there's decorated rescue later
yeah oh god this is a bad idea
I'm very scared of your eyebrows but
that's the right thing to do is it not I
can't say you can't you should choose
your knots okay yeah
I'm quite proud of myself for that star
foundation shimmers park with a shimmer
collar you know ready for that also the
worst of shimmer powder pretty
foundations oh oh I thought I was a
click shimmer foundational a highlight
yeah yeah bronzer from the foundation
always white Mastiff I need those are
the word yeah
this my friend is foundation Rimmel
that's not worry it's not worry sugar
what I'll do with it I'm doing very much
oh all right right we use the other side
as well you refine your little crack and
can't bear it doing that
Mar 6 2014
oh okay so what's next you don't
concealer you done found a ssin contour
happens yeah everyone well contour could
it makes your cheeks bigger you need
shin hwal nicer
it's what's that Oh Anastasia Beverly
Hills
that's highlight because it's sparkly so
I don't need to know and consult kick
Anastasia Beverly Hills again are we
thinking and can't ask him make the
reply then do it the same top last one
yeah that's the one we're going for you
both what we used contour my doctor for
so the dark purple take one of shelters
okay the bottom one very bottom I love
the little ins on it do you need a ruler
no hmm I can't even see it what is it
Pat Riley's head it's quite it's just a
different color a way we use just a
gathering do stuff love
oh my god I think you use the long end
the fact that you're blending right next
to my mouth concerned yellow most of it
so you do not cut that wire
but if use that for control and the
knife what you needed to go down in a
line so you needed a straight line to
follow your cheekbone
that are you know different color
eyebrows so this guy lied right so that
squad Kylie I think Kylie minerals this
Inger boy oh you having lipgloss right I
get up but different brow pom-pom art so
basically what we're going to show your
face right oh yeah right
that you want stuff that's the ramen you
don't find here on the outside so I'm
going over eyebrows and making it flat
it's actually like those are worlds and
lush either make your eyes is a lot of
lush lashes on my eyebrows oh yeah oh
watching the erotic swatting I can just
vaguely see it oh my anything cuz she's
half blind but I actually am one of all
the different approaches this one I'm
better on this side right so we're just
going to leave it once the pallets Too
Faced it's a chocolate bar oh my god
external hot chocolate eyeshadow is it
does it go above your eye or below your
eye shadow is below a person so I'm
guessing it's below your eye that's a
light boy your eyebrow eyeshadow and
this looks like quite a nice color I'm
going to use this right this little
brush and it's a concealer buffer as a
concealer buffer that's not for eyes
look he said too many of them
see you later bitch Charlotte
well it's nice don't roll your eyes at
me so you can use more than one
eyeshadow nice posture usually I just
want yellow underneath it's all gone
beneath because that's what we do you
like to go out there
oh no I've got a big white on them and
what I'm going to do is this is once
again the Anastasia of Beverly Hills the
locate for this highlight you use a
special why why did not want to point
doors laughs at eyeliner start walk
around to define or you like exaggerate
your eyelashes and going for this which
is Urban Decay liquid eyeliner so this
is the eyeliner I don't know where this
eyeliner goes so we're going to go
around the outside I think it's called
giving you wings flat rest off I've just
gone underneath right we may as well go
underneath for both of them because I've
gone underneath by accident
yeah I don't really know what we're
doing wrong I genuinely don't this is
another Kylie Kylie special Kylie Jenner
always kind of Jenner yeah I'll boots
and you do realize you still need to use
the actual lip product well I've just
called you in absolute liner I just
called you
I thought it wash please my Mac so we're
going to use on Millie's eyelashes to
make them what washing up agrees about
ones real lightly or hassle completed is
a grand reveal right well the eyebrows
rivet dark
you know it's supposed to be smooth kiss
yeah well to be fair the foundation you
did a good job really or not that is it
