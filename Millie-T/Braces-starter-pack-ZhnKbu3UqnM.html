the basic starter pack that everyone
will get when they've just got new
braces or something around the regions
of this so yeah let's start I got my
braces about half an hour ago so yeah
this is brand new haven't opened it yet
and there are races blue so yeah I'll be
the start skip just open it first
okay so Britain's first
fluoride guard fluoride floor fluoride
fluoride fluoride rinse I can't
pronounce that word type a daily cavity
protection analysts um this is a
mouthwash I'm guessing so here it is
just open this yes mouthwash oh and that
smells really nice okay so that's the
first thing
oh this is just like dad's kick take
care for your teeth and fixed braces
just like a basic book clips with all
you need to know and then Colgate ortho
and V trim and that's a special brush
for your braces
it's got like a soft bristle so it'll go
around erasers softer outer bristles
remove plaque from the gum line gum line
and clean outer surfaces of the teeth
firm inner bristles are designed to
clean around brackets and wires okay so
that's that next plaque search oh I
already have a packet of these so that's
that I'll just open a more in it all
right so you're gathering packets like
this oh honey watch for faces and and
with these push your teeth chew on a
tablet don't swallow it just chew on it
and the red plaque the orange red plaque
that appears on your teeth a shows new
plaque and then if you can the purple
light colors on your teeth and show old
plaque and the idea is that you get the
toothbrush and brush off the plaque
which leans which leaves your teeth
absolutely perfectly clean and then
you'll obviously wash it out with this
um does that bit there Colgate Total
probe gum health improves gum health
easy to use handle well exactly gonna be
hard to miss and so that's there and
then you've got the different colors is
you got your bristles there and
hang on a minute
that makes oh yeah that's number two
that's two millimeters and four
millimeters five millimeters six
millimeters and so that's how big the
Bristol is so that's for you gums
I'm guessing sit says program health so
probably for your gums and then you've
got also boring boring boring Colgate
Total advance non-stop 12-hour
protection protects cut cavities gum
problems plaque tartar sensitive teeth
fresh breath
- strengthens enamel okay so that's like
a minute above that and then finally
from this special back to go with a
special person not in that kind of
specialist in am special and and then
this is the wax I don't know if you can
oh yeah let go go back there we go so if
we open it turn on wax so I can't really
show you something like ah yeah so I'm
not gonna show you but I'm ah
end brace so you last ones there it's
like a leftover piece of wire so you get
a pink pinch of this like this roll it
up into a ball ah-ha what I have not
done this yeah
ah then do that and I'm betting you do
it for all four corners so I roll it up
into another ball rolling rolling low
win ah I'll just cross skin on that uh
ah that's filled again actually you have
to need to do that one novice I just
like caught some skin on my finger from
that it's actually really sharp I take
two ah got it
okay got it no go right so let's put it
back in there and yeah and I haven't
used time I probably used any of it
there so that is really good whoa
sunshine and so nice everything in my
starts kit just start trying them
hundreds so I serve tea nama start to
get the base is a process how it wasn't
didn't hurt it doesn't hurt at all and I
mean there was absolutely no pain
intended one of my braces like the metal
bit fell off Joey now but that wasn't a
problem uh hey so I'm just right on that
one all the actual use just like
vibrator thing they vibrated on your
teeth put it like right
ah and he's sending it all through brain
so that you shook your brain everything
it was horrible in it was really like
join y'all would you just move like that
yeah it was like that and it wasn't
really nice but yeah I don't look too or
horrible with a braces on compared to
one of their last and without the one
it's not really that much of a
difference although I do feel a bit
different like when I talk cuz I keep
having to go like this like if you have
braces now calm em and
comment when's died hurt inks don't hurt
right now but I've only ever done about
40 minutes ago and so just comment below
if it hurt
yeah how long it took off until it hurt
yeah and comment if you like and what
color you got and just basically your
experience with them doesn't have to be
long wave like a sentence to do if you
ever got em done yet comment if you want
them done and if you buy rise and shine
