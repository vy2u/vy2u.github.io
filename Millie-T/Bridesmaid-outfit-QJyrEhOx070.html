wearing for when I become a bridesmaid
in the next wedding that has been
planned and they wanted a simple look
not like tracky bottoms and a sweatshirt
or anything like that but not like My
Big Fat Gypsy Weddings not that much
they just wanted simple down-to-earth
dress and here it is along with the
shoes and the handbag so this is a dress
that I'm wearing and if I bring you look
close you'll be able to see all the
pattern and the basic pattern in is
flowers and it's like black and white
it's kind of like a nice cotton material
and it's not too sick but it's not too
thin either and with this you can like
bring it up higher if you want although
it doesn't tend to stay I must kind of
roll it like that but then it looks
quite stupid so if you leave it normal
length it goes just above the knee now
on to my shoes and my handbag
here is my handbag and it is very good
say as you can see it's got diamonds on
it and great close-up zoom in zoom out
and and yet just open it all you do is
like flick it to the side and it opens
up and to break down my side of me it
will look like that so it's a clutch and
this handbag was from like a little
market style and it was 23 pounds also
this dress was from Topshop and they
stress across 30 weight no it didn't it
cost 128 pounds and who are my shoes
finally here are my wedding shoes they
match the handbag they have a lot of
glitter on them and like other studs and
these are from the gate shop and they
were 40 pounds and they kind of give the
look not too high either just normal
size for someone my age and these are
them and I have painted my toes a plum
color does it really go with their but
it kind of
it kind gives out a future look bloopers
there were a lot of them so I paired you
see shooting the gouge shop and they
came to a total cost of forty path home
so this is what the clutch like looks
like on and if you really love to you
can just hold it fry the top and it
looks like quite normal I can hold it
from the bottom thanks watching please
