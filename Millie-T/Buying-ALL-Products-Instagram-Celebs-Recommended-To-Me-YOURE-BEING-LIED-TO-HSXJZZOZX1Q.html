greasy and I literally sprayed a
ton of dry shampoo on it and now he just
looks absolutely terrible it just looks
so messy oh wow look girl hey everyone
it's Millie so today's video I'm really
excited to do and I was on the live
stream on Instagram and wanted for you
guys suggested that I do this and I was
like that is a great idea I'm gonna do
it so here it is and basically you know
when you want to Instagram and you see
like the Kardashians and the Jenners and
I'll just basically anyone famous on
Instagram you see them like promoting
products and being like I love this
product and you should love it to go to
this website and buy this product and it
seems like the right products but in
reality they've just been paid by the
company to say that they like it so that
the company gets more sales it's not a
bad thing if they genuinely love the
product then like by all means go for it
because even on YouTube I'm to respond
to things on YouTube before and saw as
like 99% of youtubers as well but I'm
just gonna text him anyway and see what
we think just out of interest just a fun
little vid if you are new here hi my
name is Millie I've already said that if
you do want to see more videos like this
in the future then please be sure to
subscribe or if you do want to see like
more personal videos I do also have a
blog channel which I am currently
uploading to every single day so enjoy
that
he's one of you wanting to try for a
long while I've never bought from this
website but I'm gonna do a dedicated
video on it in the future
fashion over these clothes I wanted to
unbox live on a camera but I did open
the envelope just to check that it is
from fashion / first thing that I bought
from fashion over is what the heck is
this so I bought this here which is a
cropped grey sweater hoody this is a
two-piece set as well I've just
remembered and I got it with these grey
leggings as well I thought fashion novel
was so cheap and I just realized it's
not that cheap like these leggings were
$20 and then this top was $20 as well I
do not realize how much I would love
this outfit so I've always loved like
coordinated sets and this one
in gray and I just it's like such a cozy
leg in a like the John Murray woolen
material and oh my god is so comfortable
as well I also looked a little accent of
the hood I love how the leggings are
high-waisted as well I can't wear
anything that's not high-waisted I feel
like I could do anything in these I'm so
excited I'm honestly gonna wear this
outfit to death like 100% oh it's a
two-piece again I don't know why I
bought such summery clothes it's not as
if it's often going on to winter now and
it won't be somewhere for another year
but anyway I decided that I wanted to
buy these like floral print shorts cuz I
love the red and white on them and it
also is a two-piece so it comes with
this top which is cropped I just thought
this will look really cool and the tops
got flare sleeves as well and I think
fled sleeves looks so good and beachy
and summery even though it's about
somewhere anymore again so it's a crop
top with flat sleeves with high-waisted
baggy shorts so the shows are quite
baggy in this area but then they're
quite tight ish around the leg as well
but the only thing that stresses me out
about it it's like when can I wear this
other than loungewear I really want to
wear this out but again it's no longer
summer so I can't really and the last
thing from fashion / ooh why is that buy
these I don't know if the camera picks
up the actual color but the like a plum
color which is quite wait for pallets
but I kinda like a chilly tomorrow I'm
looking at them the mom like oh okay I
don't mind
also I want to say look at other models
on fashion Nova
never in my life as my self-esteem
plummeted so fast
honestly I actually do rate the plum
quite a lot I didn't think I would
my thighs in proportion to my waist are
massive so for me to find a pair of
pants or shorts or anything that fit my
waist and thighs it's like a miracle
and these are so good because a waist is
really elasticated so he just perfectly
like sits on my waist as you can see
here and it fits my thighs as well
because it's like a really thin material
uh-oh I haven't actually seen what
like on the back though they're not too
bad actually they fit quite well I think
so this is the only one that I can't
remember who actually promoted this I
just tried to do a quick search before
filming this video but I couldn't find
them I once had a product from Bondi
sands which was spray fake tan and it
was incredible like I live by that
product then they stopped doing it
something I can't find it anymore it's
really sad
why did I get it in dark oh no that was
a bad idea
say Salaam quality coconut Sun if this
actually has a coconut sin and not like
coconut mixed with 99% fake tan smell
I'll be very impressed oh wow that
actually is just a coconut scent that's
crazy okay I'm just gonna try it live on
coming out let me go get my mitts I'm so
scared because it's dark and it
shouldn't be dark here's my mitt from
Primark that's very broken as you can
see I'm such a when it comes to
fake tan okay that's not actually as
dark as I thought it would be I thought
it would actually be black okay let's
try it oh wow actually for fake tan that
doesn't smell bad at all I'm not a fake
tan Pro at all so as you can probably
tell this is going to go very wrong how
good is that quick thumbnail oh no
really no no no okay let's get blending
I have no idea how this looks on camera
whether it looks blended whether this
one doesn't that one doesn't whether
this one looks like a shade five and
that one looks like a shade one but yeah
I do rate this product so so much the
Australian time I think the fact that
it's an Australian based company just
tells you that the tanning is going to
be amazing because everyone in Australia
is a very nice tan color because the
weather though is very nice okay so the
first product that I see celebrities on
Instagram promoting constantly are those
habit means
so they are like gummy sweets and
apparently like may your hair amazingly
soft they were miracles on it so I went
and purchased have a sharable hair
vitamins
Ashley Benson has promoted this product
in the past and there's like a sister
product to this called sugar bear hair
which has been promoted by Kylie Jenner
Kim Kardashian so many celebrities but I
couldn't buy sugar bear hair because it
was so expensive and also the shipping
time was ridiculous so I went for hair
bursts and there's also a funny story
with that because my manager contacted
me a few days ago and said Herbert
wanted to make a sponsored Instagram
post for them and I was like I'm kind of
sort of gonna be slating them in my next
video so no thanks they literally like
gummy sweets with vitamins packed in
them it looks like that as you can see I
don't know if you'll be able to tell but
I have eaten like almost all of them but
these take a few weeks to work so I've
just been having a few of these a day or
like having ten one day and then missing
a day because I got addicted and kept
eating them and I will give these gummy
sweets ten out of ten in taste from
having these for about three weeks now I
have come to a conclusion and that is
drumroll please they don't work I mean
it might do a little bit's it is packed
with vitamins and stuff but like not
noticeably and it's definitely not worth
the money like it doesn't make that much
of a difference at all so the next one
is a very famous one that you if you use
Instagram all you will have seen this
being promoted in the past and this
overly promoted product is tea detox I
was debating whether school for 50 of
Booty but 50 was really hard to get hold
of and I just like the shipping time was
ridiculous as well so I just went for
booty but this has definitely been
promoted by Instagram models tea detoxes
are promoted so much on Instagram I'm
pretty sure it's like the number-one
most promoted products and I don't know
why and it just is I think they just
paid well probably but this one's called
booty it's a 14-day tea talks I wanted
to go down a different route with these
compared to the hair vitamins and just
try these live on camera and taste the
tea I can't actually remember off the
top of my head her booty was promoted by
you I know this being a lot I'll insert
them here again everyone that has as if
it being
healthy tea wasn't concerning enough I
see the teabag and it's literally like
someone's crushed grass and put it in a
mesh bag it's disgusting and I do not
want to be near this hello everyone so
it's really back with another video and
today we're going to be testing out this
50 and help you yeah yay so I'm actually
thinking of like taking up a more
healthier lifestyle just exactly like
it'll be better for like the body in
mind it smells disgusting it smells like
cut grass mixed with boiling water
because that is literally what it is I
can't help making a repulsive face so
this is gonna be great for a thumbnail
just show this and
okay I should have got a thumbnail out
of that like in a little bit it's fine
it's like slightly minty but when you
put a full-on mouthful just it's just
basically a no-go zone nope I can't this
next product I found through Kylie
Jenner promoting it so it's by Nippon
fab skin and it's called dragon's blood
fix plumping serum I'm gonna sound so
uneducated right now but I can't decide
with it it has blood in it or not I
don't know whether that's just the name
or whether there's like a little bit of
blood because it's beneficial in some
way I can't tell this is basically a
skin care product that Kylie Jenner
promoted and is super hydrating it's a
plumping serum and it contains
hyaluronic acid and Dragon's Blood I
wanted to try this product because I
kind of needed it anyway because my skin
gets dehydrated up really easily the
first time I use is I saw such a
difference in my skin it just made it a
lot like nicer and smoother I like it
was no longer driving literally did what
it says or the one thing that it did do
was it still like a bitch and I don't
know why I don't have the more sensitive
skin but it's ever so slightly sensitive
and this like tingles so bad on my face
and I have quite high pain tolerance but
II like her as in my eye - like
streaming and stuff it's like a
translucent product and it's like quite
a weird texture it smells so good though
I really like this product I'd say it
was pretty 50/50 but there were
definitely a few things that were an
absolute fail in this video for example
the harbour spits mints more I think
about them the more I realize how much
of a ripoff they are like they don't do
anything at all and well I don't think I
will like the tea talks because it's
healthy and just made of plants and
herbs and stuff and the only plant that
I like is Reed Jost
so I hope that you did enjoy this video
if you did give a thumbs up and leave a
comment below let me know how you found
it also go and check out my vlog channel

get to know me a little bit more if you

vlog channel is the way to do that a
hundred percent if I don't know why
