blog it was the worst day ever
I did not like it at all
okay so I'll get into detail about what
happened first and it will more just me
but it wasn't a good day all and all
then before I get into that I didn't
tell you one thing now I have given you
two options you can either look here and
you will see you link or you can look in
the description box and copy and paste
that link and open it in a new tab and
you'll still be able to see me now what
it is is it's a advertising campaign and
you'll get money from it now I'm not
sure how you'll you'll get money but and
if you already have YouTube videos and
you have maybe oh oh you have to have a
lot of subscribers that's all really and
but if you click on that link and you
and you follow all the steps or do
whatever it says you will get money now
on average each month I say I get about
Oh actually I can't tell you how much I
make because it's just in the M I'm
showing the condition so I can't really
tell you how much I make but it's a
decent amount it's not it's not it's not
like over a thousand but it's not like
it's not like I get like 50 P a month
you see decent amount it's a good amount
and so if you go from that link you can
just earn money from YouTube and all it
does is advertises on your videos and
you'll get money for impressed and that
clicks on that videos or you'll get
money for it just been able to advertise
and if you don't have videos I'm pretty
sure it'll find another way now it's not
a virus it's not a scam I can promise
you that I'm not going to give you a
link to something that'll give you a
virus but if you look in the link it'll
say M Miller maybe one um and that's my
original YouTube name I know it's makeup
with merely 24 now what so I keep
missing my hair it's annoying me but now
my original name is Millie my blue one
which I made when I was 9 and I
happy with it I'm embarrassed by it and
so just click on the link if you want to
make a money somehow and it's just I
listen this is basically just a bit of
advertising that I'm doing for it
and if every time you click on the link
I'll get a bit of money from it
and that's us that's good that's not bad
um so just if even if you're not gonna
do anything if you love me and want to
marry me then click on the link no if
you just want to feel nice or whatever
then just like click on the link you
don't have to do anything with it and
then just click on the link and then
click X and come back to this video it's
just in the description and you can just
go highlight it right click open a new
tab and then it'll go up and then you
can follow the rules if you actually
want to make money or if you just want
to see what it's about
oh if you're just feeling nice and you
just do it anyway so now onto my blog
vlog I did not enjoy this day
it was awful okay so there was no just
stuff at school happening like there's
this person that really annoys me they
really know me now they never shut up
talking anything at the bastok never
gonna that's what they do all day I
don't they're going to an argument with
them are we saying all this stuff and
then he's come back to fail in their
comebacks for failing really really bad
and they were just you know just
annoying me basically he's that kind of
person I just want to punch in the face
with always and yeah I usually really
good friends this person as well but now
the turn into a date colder I'll turn
into an idiot so you know no thank you
I'm actually um so yeah I'm not really
too bothered about that you're just like
annoying man it just put me in a bad
mood all day basically and that's one
thing the next thing was my teacher got
stressed and because I forgot my book
and it's not even a big deal because
everyone else forgot the books because
we were taught by our forum teacher that
we wouldn't need it because we hadn't
assemble
that will last for an hour because it's
in Memorial assemblies all right then we
won't bring the books because it adds
extra weight to the to your back and
lyceum you don't want that so would you
bring it and then you had to go up me
for not bringing now sigh all right then
fair enough
bye I don't care and then I end up
taking pictures out with another book in
using that you just go and put your
lesson I was just alright then see
yourself I don't care and we act am
twenty five minutes of adolescence
that's not a lot and then leave the
lessons went alright nothing special
about them they're just like school
really like they weren't too great um so
that was around school and then after
school I came home and I found out that
I didn't get the part this M for this
audition I went to which isn't too much
a big deal I mean I've been to all I
failed auditions I've been to a lot of
successful auditions and but this one
which one never happened before I
running at the part the director had
personally total intend to tell my mom
and the old to tell me that I was a
fantastic actress I was really good and
the reason I think that the part was
because I was too old if I would have
been like 12 or 11 or 10 I would have
got the part most likely and my mom says
and lint and say but because I was
because I wasn't like too old they
wouldn't get it he couldn't leave me the
part and I'll be I would have recently
got the part in this film if you want me
to do a vlog on all like parts and
things like that things like this video
and but I just went through a recent
audition and I got that and that was
really good and I really enjoyed it but
I was playing in an 11 year old girl
there and I got away with their best
pose like different companies and
different people they might think I look
too old or too young or whatever well
not too young or too old and but quite a
few people in characters casting
directors say that I can have a good age
at age range i could play about 10 to 17
if i wanted so i was alright
as I was happy with that it helps your
lying auditions
but the reason longer to upset for
longer the audition is because um I know
that it's just because of the way I look
so I shouldn't take it sorry about
shaking them so I didn't know I
shouldn't take it to heart that it's
just my acting skills that only was bad
because obviously for carnation Street
I'm a white girl and they give the part
to an Asian person when the Asian go so
I was just like well because you wanted
someone Asian so you know I'm not saying
it's completed so hot that it's your
acting then we didn't go to the pub and
we'd only go for a pub and have a
takeaway every Friday but then I had to
KFC so that kind of made me happier
because I like KFC and then my internet
will messing up and loads of the stuff
and it won't let me edit my videos
because I have Windows Live Movie Maker
and it would just coming up with a green
screen of blank green screen whose so
annoying so yeah I haven't really had a
good day I wasn't happy at all really no
I wasn't so now I'm just gonna like
crying hibernate and its really crappy
day there's lots of other stuff that
happened but there too and then I've big
deal so and I'll be ever branded that
hour talking to you about them so thank
