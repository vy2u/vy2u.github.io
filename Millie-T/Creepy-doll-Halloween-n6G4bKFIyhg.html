okay so I'm not going to catch even or
anything tonight but I'm going to drama
and I'm coming as a creepy doll so
here's my creepy doll look so basically
I'll just talk you through what I've use
so this face painter and I've used black
crayon for the eyebrows and for my eyes
and then false lashes here and here
contacts for my eyes obviously then I
line for the cracks and then nail
varnish from my lips
ya know probably shouldn't be able to do
Pulu shouldn't do that but I did and
then um I mean Janelle varnish for blood
tears and then I need to back comb my
hair a bit more just basically make it
funky yeah so I think you're not showing
my look and and it stings putting a
bunch on your lips but it doesn't if any
of you have the mini us like bond kind
of tingles like that but more painful
the contacts and I've got used to them
now and the contacts are nine pounds and
it's quite cheap actually your contacts
for nine nine pound so that's quite a
lot but you know it just tops off the
look then you got the face paints and
here and then just basically you don't
really even need the face paints just
black eyeliner and then just orange
blusher that you can use for this bit
here and then really red lipstick but
are you chose nail varnish so this is my
look comment what you think like this
and I've got this idea this look idea
off I'll just stop now because it's off
a really amazing girl
and on a her Channel and I basically
copied her look um but maybe a bit
differently so if I just go into it now
and sorry about this should about it
already but I just and just last minute
undecided to show you her so
