to today's video which is going to be a
monthly favorites or like current
favorites I haven't done one of these in
a while but I really just wanted to sit
down and tell you my favorites so first
of all I'm going to start with apps so
the first app today being loving is
called fabric it's a fashion app and and
there should be like a video of like a
walkthrough for how you use it there in
its fashion element all to do with sales
so basically you can see what fashion is
trending and follow it and tag it and
once you tag that product you will be
notified when it goes on sale or when
the price drops also a new tag can be
added to a category on your profile so
your fire-pot winter wear which is one
of my categories you've got all of the
other things that I want for winter and
in one role and anything on that
category that comes on sale I will know
about semi notification also another way
to use it is that I have got Topshop on
my phone as an app or even you can use
the online website obviously and for New
Year's Eve I really want a nice dress to
wear so all I need to do is type name on
the fabric app search bar I'm tag that
products and I will be notified when it
goes on sale for food this has to be
said of course my advent calendar
obviously and I got a Thornton's one
this year and only got like one pound
once this probably wasn't too expensive
but if the chocolate tastes a lot better
and also I like the little setting on
there and I meant calendars attention
for the build up to Christmas the
original polo mints are amazing but the
polo mints spearmint Edition are
astounding they are so so good they just
delight extra spearmint chewing gum but
since extra have changed the ingredients
that they've made it that they use to
make chewing gum it's not as good so the
spearmint polos have to replace the
chewing gum now sorry extra next part
secretes makeup I've got quite a bit to
go through first product is false nails
from Primark these are so good sorry if
you're in America I don't think you guys
have a Primark so I'm sorry about this
but in the UK we have a Primark and it
is really really good I mean so the
clothing is at the best
sometimes you'll find some pretty good
finds that they don't stay on for the
longest time but like one nail of Dale
come off and you just have the glue in
your pocket and you just take the glue
out and just stick your nail back on and
you're good to go
also at the benefit they're real mascara
because I have heard a lot about this
but I hadn't tried it so I've got it a
few months ago and I really like it it's
so good at lengthening your lashes and
adding thickness and it also just would
clump them up another thing is that it
doesn't dry extremely fast so if you
want to use them if you want to use an
eyebrow brush to separate your eyelashes
it's easy to do so it was like 17 pounds
50 from the airport because when I go to
Manchester Airport I do like to have
said discounts so I always go to Mac and
benefit and just find anything and this
time went to benefit got the very loose
Cara also I have this eyebrow gel from
L'Oreal Paris
it's called brow artist plumper I'm not
too sure how much this was I'm pretty
sure it was about 10 pounds and eyebrow
gel is really really good the only thing
I can see don't only use eyebrow gel and
just keep pushing your eyebrows part of
because then it makes it a little while
your eyebrows stuck to your head which
technically they are more like the whole
hairs like plastered to your head it's
just a lot good so what I do is that I
use a eyebrow powder and then I use
eyebrow gel and skim it over my heads of
my eyebrows because it just accentuates
them and it tells people like hey my
eyebrows aren't fake I have has also
this bastante champu that's panting
that's not Spanish
the petite dry shampoo in the blonde it
adds a unit of color apparently but I
haven't really noticed but when I wake
up in the mornings and I brush my hair
because I've got quite a long hair it's
quite heavy it's quite thick as well so
like going from the morning so my hair
will be like that so all I need to do is
put my hair up
well my fingers through it and it adds a
lot more volume which I really like and
also partnered with a backcombing brush
these goes together like apple and pie
this I think my friend Emma actually got
me this for my birthday
tee-hee-hee the Rimmel London's alum Pro
lycra nail polish and it is for 5-7
Cooper
great and it's a really really nice
color I've got it on my toes right now
but I don't have anything on my fingers
because I'm currently growing my nails
because I'd be why I'm living off false
nails recently the Primark ones of
course so that is it for the makeup
section absolutely love makeup and my
last current favorite if a camera lens
that I recently purchased and it is a 50
millimeter lens
I think it's f one point a I think and
it is so so good it's really nice I'm
using it right now and it gives you a
really nice blurry background like wrap
my crap around my background might not
be very blurred out right now but found
to be come closer to the camera it blur
out a lot more but I've got it on manual
focus so if I move forward it won't make
any difference my current favorites this
month I really enjoyed this video I
don't talk in videos that much and I
think that I've been talking really fast
throughout this whole video and I
apologize for that but I hope you
enjoyed it if you did enjoy it please
give it a thumbs up and just leave a
comment let me know your monthly
favorites and what you thought of this
video any of my favorites that you like
as well that would be good too have a
beautiful day and don't forget to stay
positive and also check out the fabric
app it's amazing Wow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
