another video this video is going to be
a DIY charcoal mask using Elmer's glue
and activated charcoal it will not harm
you in any way unless you do have an
allergic reaction so make sure you do a
patch test 24 to 48 hours before doing
this DIY just be on the safe side I have
watched numerous videos on YouTube on
this and they all seem to work perfectly
so hopefully as we'll achieve the same
results as you watch this video if you
enjoy what you see please press the
subscribe button and stick around for
more videos although this cat will only
do this video because I found it few
minutes ago and so also if Fran is
helpful please give a thumbs up and also
leave your thoughts in the comment
section below because I love to know
what you think of the video any feedback
is extremely helpful so for this you
will need somewhat non-toxic liquid glue
as this is going on your face so make
sure it's non-toxic if it is it's safe
as you know young kindergarten children
use this and they won't die if it goes
on their faces as they get it everywhere
you'll also need some activated charcoal
because it makes a great candidate for a
deep cleanser and detoxifier it's all
natural and won't add new chemicals to
your skin and hair when you use it so I
added the charcoal in unused for
capsules along with glue and you'll
probably need to eyeball it to see what
kind of consistency it comes out with
and whether you're happy with it
that's what I did and I am extremely
happy with my results so I recommend you
doing what I did and just stirring it
and hoping for the best but as a general
guide I would say to use it in the ratio
three-to-one with the charcoal and
liquid glue I then applied it to my
whole face but as you will discover
later on try and keep it away from the
edges of your face as when you peel it
off it takes every single hair out with
it and it is painful
my friend Kirsty also did it but she
just used it as a nose peel because she
found she had quite a few whiteheads on
her nose and this helped her get rid of
them and whilst we were waiting for the
masks to dry we decided to go and say
hello to a few farm animals
so once my mask had dried I could peel
it off and it came off in one go so I
was pretty happy about that and it was
extremely satisfying though he did hurt
quite a bit as it was taking out every
single hair on my face especially around
the edges but first they only did a nose
peel so that wasn't painful at all for
her and it worked pretty well in
removing the whiteheads
so as I was takin the mask off it was
extremely painful so when you do it try
and stick to the nose area or try to
stay as far away from the edge of your
face as possible because there's a lot
of little hairs there there wasn't as
many kind of whiteheads on the strip as
I had hoped but there's still quite a
few and my face feels extremely smooth
because if anything it waxed my face but
it wasn't too painful to take off it was
definitely bearable just play around
with the consistency as well of the face
mask until you find consistency that
works for you and that pulls off as many
whiteheads or blackheads as possible and
gets rid of as many blemishes as
possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
