was Halloween all year round because
this would be my permanent setup but I
have put it to good use because this
video is going to be a how to make a
cookie monster pumpkin DIY video so I
hope that you'll give it a go unless
you've watched this video knowing that
you'll never try it out I always do that
I'll be like going on a random DIY spree
on YouTube and I'll end up on a video
like how to make a bacon flavored tree
and I'm obviously never gonna make that
but they're just entertaining to watch
so I hope you enjoyed this video also if
you are new to my channel please press
that subscribe button so you will be
updated on any future videos that I post
let's go on to the next clip see how
this pumpkin turns out so the first
thing that I did was I went on to Google
and I googled Cookie Monster and I used
the images that I found on there as
inspiration for my design also I already
carved out the pumpkin and took the lid
off but I just wanted to show you the
part where I drew on a really big mouth
with a sharpie and then cut that out and
obviously that is going to be the large
mouth of the Cookie Monster make it
bigger rather than smaller I play some
foil inside the pumpkin and then spray
painted a a a midnight blue kind of
color it turned out so so nicely the
color and I just left it to dry for two
hours during that period I moved on to
the eyes of the Cookie Monster that are
quite huge or really really big so I
used baubles for each eye and also I
could have used ping pong balls but I
stuck with bubbles but just letting you
know that there are quite a few options
from there all I had to do was cut and
draw some pupils and all I did for this
was use a white piece of paper to draw
out two large circles pull them in with
a black sharpie and hot glue gun them
onto the bubbles or if you are using a
ping-pong ball
the ping-pong ball
I would also just like to say that for
the second I make it slightly higher and
further left than the other I because
Cookie Monster is slightly bug-eyed now
these free paint is finally dry we can
move on to sticking and gluing on the
eyeballs so as you can see it has set a
really really nice deep blue color and I
already spoke on one eye but I forgot to
film that bit so just follow what I do
for the second I simply a hot glue gun
it and the bottom and stick it onto the
top of the pumpkin and literally that is
all you have to do for the eyes now is
my favorite part where you have to just
stuff it space full of cookies and also
kind of make them kind of seep out of
the mouth and spread along the floor
because he's like stuffing his mouth and
throwing up me girge tasting cookies in
my mind so that's how I envisioned and
that's how I have done it on my Cookie
Monster this is the final result I
really hope you like it I am in love
with it have a absolutely wonderful
Halloween and if you recreate this
Cookie Monster pumpkin send it to me on
Instagram that is in today's video guys
I really hope that you enjoyed it if you
did leave a big thumbs up and stay tuned
for our next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
