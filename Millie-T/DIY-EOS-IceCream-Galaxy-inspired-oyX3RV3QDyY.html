today's video is going to be DIY ice
cream cos lip balm and it's going to be
galaxy inspired because I'm in love with
galaxies right now and I think it's
because of the lovely colors and I'm
also obsessed with space in general if
you enjoyed this video please subscribe
so I have lots plan for the future are
you going to need this an EOS lip-balm a
plastic shot glasses it could melt in
the oven some air drying or oven baked
clay some paintbrushes or makeup bushes
if you don't have any paintbrushes like
me some pain galaxy colours and also a
brown for the comb some tin foil and
some superglue or hot glue it does seem
like a lot of items however most of
these you will find around your house
alrighty then so I just began by
wrapping some tin foil around the shot
glass and I wrapped it around extremely
tight so that it can come loose or
anything and also with the axe excess
excess foil I tucked it into these shot
glass so that it gave me a really clean
idea of what the shot glass won't like
and the shape of it I also place some
foil inside of the shot glass so that it
didn't melt as much when it was put in
the oven make sure your shot glass is
cheap because it is going to be ruined
once the clay goes into the oven I've
said open too many times now so next I
got some clay rolled it out into a
circular shape and wrap that as tight as
I could around the shot glass that was
already wrapped in tinfoil and then with
the excess I just cut that off
so then it was time to do the top of the
cone so all I did for that was to gather
the excess clay and cut out a long
rectangular shape that was very thin and
I made sure that it had very clean edges
as well so that it was more crisp and
then I wrapped it around the top of the
shot glass and it currently looks like
one part that will change soon
so the bottom part was already fully
over now so it was time to prepare the
top of the ice cream so all I did was
get the eos top and wrapped it in
tinfoil so it was all over and ready and
then got some flattened out clay and
just placed that on top of the EOS
lip-balm and cut around it so that it
was the perfect size however if it isn't
a perfect fit and there is a bit of a
gap but at the bottom it doesn't really
matter too much because the way we are
doing that ice cream is going to be
slightly different and it's going to
cover up the missed out areas the way I
did my ice cream was inspired by Yvette
Polanco and she's a youtuber and I will
link her channel below on her video she
also did a DIY ice cream iOS but I
wanted to put a galaxy inspired twist to
my ice cream iOS so next I got some clay
and rolled it out into a sausage
formation and then wrapped it around the
base of the EOS and then this is the
kind of style of ice cream that we will
be doing however I then wanted to make
it look more realistic so I got an
eyebrow brush and use the side of that
to add texture to the ice cream
before we can move on to painting we
have to put it in the oven at 275
degrees Fahrenheit for my clay Google
the instructions for your clay if you
are baking it just to see how long it
needs and then I just make sure
everything fit and then glued it all
together
sodapeta bottom up econ I used a Jew
looks sample pain in mulch ugly it was
about one pound fifty per pain part and
there was plenty and it looks slightly
purple but that's because I have
oversaturated the video stylet oh bloody
how that is very bright I apologize to
your eyes but it was time to the galaxy
effects so I used a pink a light blue
and a purple and I just blended them all
together now when it comes to actually
blending it using a sponge is absolutely
great as it adds quite a lot of texture
to it and it doesn't have to be very
neat as you can see mine is very very
messy but it all gets blended together
anyway and you're almost guaranteed to
have a galaxy effect you don't have to
be talented or skillful with it
whatsoever and then once I've done
painting it I'd then went on to adding
stars so I just got some white paint and
a nail art pencil and just dab the month
so the final thing you need to do is to
draw on an ice cream cone design that I
did this with a dark brown felt tip and
made a crisscross pattern it does look
very harsh with the color so I just went
ahead and put another layer of paint to
make it more translucent then I placed
the top of the ice cream on and I was
done with my design that is it for me
guys I really hope you enjoyed this
video if you did leave a comment telling
me your opinions and any suggestions I
am open to all have a beautiful day and
don't forget to stay positive
mwah bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
