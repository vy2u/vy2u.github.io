morning and I look like a lady see if
I'm a celebrity so I thought it was
probably better off that I didn't film
an introduction because I look like an
absolute mess so I do apologize about
that
but today's DIY is going to be some
edible marshmallow play-doh so I hope
you'll enjoy it all you're going to need
for this is a glass bowl some coconut
oil and get it in a solidified form as
well be sure let's get it in liquid form
also some food coloring so I got green
yellow and red as these turned out to be
a very nice pastel color so I was
definitely into that and also some icing
sugar confectionery sugar powdered sugar
whatever you call it from way off rum
and some marshmallows I got pink as well
because it ended up to not make too much
of a difference wants you to add up the
food coloring start off by adding five
marshmallows to a bowl along with 3/4 of
spoonfuls full worth of coconut oil and
three tablespoons worth of icing sugar
then place in the microwave for around
20 seconds or until your marshmallows
get really big be sure not to overcook
them though I'm gonna take it out it
should look something like this then you
can begin to stir them around and also
add your food coloring you can also add
a beep tone worth of food coloring
because bigger is better in this case
because healthy and a good cooling made
no difference whatsoever so once it
becomes quite difficult to stir move to
one side of your bowl and begin kneading
it with your hands and it should feel
exactly like playdough and taste really
good as well it will taste like coconut
so if you don't like coconut use some
other kind of cooking oil
your mixture might end up having quite a
few lumps and bumps in it and if this is
the case and simply just knead it out
for about two minutes and hopefully that
should go away I love this idea so much
that I also did it in the color green
and green I would recommend it turned
out to be a gorgeous lime green color so
definitely give that one a go
I can't believe how short this video has
been but I hope you don't mind as this
is the end of today's video I really
hope that you enjoyed it if you did give
it a thumbs up and please leave a
comment below as I love reading and
replying to them and maybe even
subscribe have a beautiful day and don't
get today positive
