today's video I really hope that you
enjoy it and that you will try some of
these out if you do suddenly picture on
Instagram or snapchat so that I can see
how well you did which is probably
better than me all you're going to need
is some USB sticks some modeling clay I
struggled so much to find some but in
the end I did find it and it was 1
pounds for a pack so I got three just in
case it wasn't enough and also you will
need some utensils to cut and scoop up
your design I didn't film this part but
all I did was I cut out a semicircle on
some thick clay for the pink part of the
watermelon and then for the white rind
of the watermelon I went about it two
different ways first of all I rolled
clay into a sausage shape and cut down
the middle to make it thin and then just
wrapped it around the watermelon but it
still looked a little bit messy from
that so I attempted it a second time and
as you can see here the clay is
sectioned off into five stripes in a way
so I counted two stripes and just cooked
down that and that gave me the perfect
measurements to just wrap around the
watermelon and it gave me a really
really clean edge which I love
so now the final part of the design was
to shape the sieve so all I did is get
some black clay rip a tiny section off
and roll it into a ball then I looked at
the diagram of the watermelon as the
emoji and just copied up the location of
the seeds there
so it was time to put the USB Drive in
so I chose the top of the watermelon and
with a craft knife I cut out a
rectangular design I scooped out the
remains and then placed the USB Drive in
that space also for added security I've
got some pink clay and placed that on
the back of the USB
all you need to do is get some yellow
clay and roll it out into a bowl so that
it resembles the shape of a head for the
heart IMO J then you just get some red
clay and this is going to be used for
the eyes of course
oh god sake yes so basically you can't
even trust me with children as toys
either because I will somehow find a way
to destroy those hmm so with the
circular clay I cook out a triangular
design so it came out as a triangle with
a curved edge and the curved edge is
going to be used as the top of the heart
and I'm just going to cut a triangle
shape out of the middle of that curve I
got out a slightly semicircle shape of
clay and then cut out a small semicircle
from that and that obviously became the
mouth however you might notice that I
made two adjustments in the end and
those were the mouth because the brown
resembled the color red too much so
black made more of a contrast and also I
increase the size of the head because
the head was slight would you small and
it looked a bit weird with the PG USB
stick sticking outside
so for the head I used play-doh so when
it came to cutting out a USB shape it
was really really easy because all I had
to do was kinda dig out the shape ever
so slightly and then I just got the USB
stick and pushed it in as play-doh is
pretty malleable so it worked out very
well in the end so the final emoji is
the peace emoji which I'm sure you'll
all love as we all like pizza although I
never used to funny story actually
and by the way if you have a favorite
emoji from these three commented below
just so I know for future emoji videos
that I might do all I did was get at
some yellow clay and I just molded it
into the shape of a triangle but it
still had to be pretty thick and then I
got my scooper device and I scooped it
up from the cross side because I just
found that doing that maybe cost a lot
thicker so that it had a more realistic
appearance I guess
I was really happy actually cuz I found
this clay in my house and never knew I
had but I only had it in a few colors
and it was a thin cylinder shape which
was great for the pepperoni still I had
to do was cut out thin slices and it was
perfect and they're all the same size so
for the course you really don't have to
worry about being perfect because it
doesn't matter the one on the emoji is
far from perfect and that is what gives
it a more realistic effect so I've got a
rectangular piece of clay and I just
with my fingers flattened it out in
certain places so that it had a kind of
curved effect to it which I really like
and then once it was the right length I
just stuck it down to the clay if you
having trouble with things sticking use
a hot glue gun I was very tempted to do
but I didn't
you
you
you
you
you
so this is the first attempt I had that
put in the USB Drive into the design and
as I took it apart I thought I'd broken
up I further broke that burn it's all
good it's all good
taken apart this is what the USB looked
like and it was looked a bit risky in
terms of it getting broken so you can
actually get a cover for it which I use
to which kind of protected all the
inside parts then get a craft knife and
cut out a rectangular shape again and
just dig out the remains that is but
what you do for every single design and
then after that just push the USB drive
in and you've got your very own emoji
style USB so it's very special
and that is all the USB drives completed
I really hope you enjoyed this video as
I said there are a lot more DIYs to come
in the future so I hope you look forward
to that
happy beautiful day and don't forget to
stay positive bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
