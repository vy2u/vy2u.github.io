I've had my buns just kinda chopped off
a little bit today's video is going to
be three DIY gift ideas for your mom and
grandma anyone any loved one but mainly
for your mom as it I got these gifts
mammal on earth Earth Day about one or
two days ago and she really really loved
them and that they were like thoughtful
and she did really liked him so I highly
recommend that you do them too because
every mom on this planet more or less it
would rather have their children DIY
something for them rather than just spit
up a little money and buy it and these
are relatively inexpensive as well so I
do hope that you use for them if you do
so me picture on Instagram or snapchat
or wherever and if you do address video
as you're watching it give it a thumbs
up and maybe even subscribe as that
would make me rather happy on to the
video I do hope that you enjoy it anyway
you can only hear my voice now hello
this first DIY is a 10 reasons why I
love you JA and I really enjoyed making
this so I hope you do too if you decide
to do it are you going to mean to say ja
ne sais subscribe but paper some
accessories to decorate it with a pen
some scissors some hot glue and also
some spray paint I'm not too sure what
brand the spray paint is but if you can
find as many keywords as you can on the
packaging and Google it should come up
that's what I do with some lyrics anyway
and it normally works after that I
proceeded to spray paint my jar and I do
realize that I was getting spray paint
on my fingers and it's not great to get
it on your fingers so try to wear gloves
once that is dried it took about two
hours to dry my garage then just trace
around the lid on your decorative
scrapbook paper or wrapping paper and
then cut it out quick tip when you're
cutting it out cut it out smaller than
you actually do it on just so it all fit
on the lid perfectly
so I stuck that on with my hot glue gun
but it was very very hard because it
burnt my fingers a lot no it's under the
fun part you can decorate it however you
wish you can let your creativity run
wild
oh is it imagination I'm not too sure I
probably butchered it but I'm gonna go
with creativity cuz it sounds better so
I decided to use a light pink ribbon
because I felt like it complemented the
blue spray paint on the jar very well
and I do realize that using these two
calls makes it look very girly but it's
a Mother's Day DIY video so it's gonna
be a bit cheesy so to cover up the
imperfection whether to enter me I just
used a square pearl to cover up that
imperfection so I just made sure that
was stuck on well and good and then
using another piece of scrapbook paper I
just cut out an arch cuz it match the
shape of the jar and just stuck it
across the front and I wrote I love you
because I didn't have a lot of room to
write 50 reasons why I look at you so I
just but I love you on the front and
also again I didn't have much room on
the lid so I just stuck a light blue
polka dot button on top now on the
inside put really nice messages inside
to give to your moms two reasons why you
love her so I put things like I love
your pasta you smell nice so you have
the best laugh and it's just a real
really nice idea
next up we have a few of my favorite
things basket is pretty self-explanatory
but I'm still going to go into detail
anyway because it's a DIY video after
all are we going to need is a plane bus
gift I got mine from Assuan it was six
pounds and inside you need to put a few
of your mom's favorite things my mom was
like a jessica's airline color is she
needed some new candles for the table
because the other ones had already
burned out she'll also cause his socks
for keeping warm in the wintertime
specially in England and I got toast
some dark blue nail polish because dark
blue is her favorite collage needed some
nail polish this next one is extremely
cheesy but your mom will absolutely love
it guaranteed are we going to need for
this is colored pencil scrapbook paper
some ribbon scissors and some glue so
all I did was I began with drawing
around my hand on some scrapbook paper
my handle just about fit I need to do
this to both hands as well and then
after that you need to proceed to cut
out your hands so you have two
life-sized handles of yours then take
another piece of scrapbook paper or the
same piece and just cut out two strips
or if it's a big piece of paper just one
strip all do
I'm gonna be honest not too sure how to
describe this but kind of fold paper one
way and fold it again the other I'm sure
you did it in prime school or preschool
and it gives you this zigzag design then
glue both strips together to make an
even longer strip so you can look your
mom even more you'll know what I mean in
the moment now take each end of your now
very long strip and glue it to the
center of each hand it might be a bit
confusing at the minute but it'll make
sense as to what its going to become in
a minute I then wrote I love you on one
hand and this much on another and if you
want to make this your mom's actual card
you could write something along lines of
to mom happy Mother's Day I love you for
arm whatever your name is a but who is a
we shall never find out until the final
episode the final season of Pretty
Little Liars put a little wire fans I
know you're out there say hello in the
comments section below we are a huge
family now so anyway when your mom opens
the card it will go I love you this much
and if you want to be funny and take the
make a bet you can make the strip inside
really really long so it'll be like I
love you this much and I'll be very very
much anyway that is the end of today's
video guys I really hope you enjoyed it
I absolutely loved filming DIY feel so I
enjoyed filming it don't forget to show
your mom some love this Valentine's Day
I love you all have a wonderful day and
don't get stay positive bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
