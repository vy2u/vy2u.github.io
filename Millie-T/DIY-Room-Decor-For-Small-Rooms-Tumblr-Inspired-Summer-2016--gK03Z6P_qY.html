this part 2 of a DIY tumblr room decor
video it's not really carry on I've just
uploaded two DIY videos in a row so I'm
gonna call them part 1 and part 2 this
video is a collaboration with crystal
blue tonight or Tasman she is a
wonderful beautiful and just an amazing
person she is one of the nicest people
I've met on YouTube so definitely go and
check out her channel on her video it
will be linked in the description and
please don't forget to subscribe if you
really do enjoy my videos or DIYs in
general this first DIY is a tumblr
inspired anchor art design all you need
is a canvas some drawing pins both of
which I got from Poundland a rubber and
a pencil step number one is to type in
tumblr anchors onto google images and
scroll down until you find one that you
like after that you can just enlarge the
image and copy it up onto your canvas
my drawing surprisingly came out quite
successful which I was rather proud of
but once you finished drawing out your
design grab your pack of drawing pins
and begin punching them through the
canvas like so
I am so so in love with this next DIY so
I hope that you like it too because all
you will need is some washi tape and if
you are in the UK you can buy it from
hobby crafty next find an area of your
room that you might want this to be
displayed on measure how much you will
need and then stick it down so I chose
the side of my drawers down the side of
my wardrobe and also down the side of my
door the DIY plant terrarium I have seen
displayed all over tumblr oh you will
need some going compost a fish balls
some desert plants or cacti and a spoon
I began by spooning in the compost or
soil into the fish bowl until I filled
it in about half way and as you will see
in the next clip I cracked the bowl
completely I was banging it a lot harder
than I thought
once I had filled it halfway I dug a
hole and began planting my cacti if you
are planting a cactus then make sure you
use a spoon to push it down or some
gardening gloves or thick gloves so that
they don't prick you to make sure it was
sturdy I then added some more soil
around the base of the cactus so that it
wouldn't fall over I'm with a dog or a
cat will know what I mean when I say
that animals sometimes go on a mad one
or a loony run and my dog decided to go
on one as I was filming this video but
on the floor where he was rolling around
so say hello to Charlie everybody
I'm pretty sure cacti is the plural use
of cactus and if it's not then this
whole video is a disaster but finally I
added rocks and pebbles to give it a
more Natura stick effect and I have seen
this all over my tumblr newsfeed and
keep in mind that this might not be
tumblr for everyone for everyone's
newsfeed is different on tumblr so if
you have a problem with it then just get
out of here
sorry I keep interrupting all the music
beat drops with my voiceovers but we
gotta get on to the next DIY which is a
Scrabble placemat all you'll need is a
hot glue gun and some Scrabble pieces I
have a very fierce hot glue gun as it is
pink and if you want your placemat to be
square then you will need for words with
four letters in them or five words with
five letters in them I chose to use for
words with four letters in them and I
chose to use the words love live sing
and chic and once you have arranged them
accordingly you can then use your hot
glue gun or superglue to just glue them
all together and it makes a pretty nice
place map
I do hope that you have enjoyed all of
today's DIY ideas and I also hope that
you will go and check out Tasman channel
too as for my videos that is all for
today have a beautiful day and don't
forget to stay positive bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
