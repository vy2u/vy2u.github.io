hope that you enjoy it and if you do

part one and a part 2 or another DIY
room decor video will be coming out in a
few weeks and it will be a collaboration
but I'm not going to give too much away
about that so if you do want to stay
tuned to my channel and get notified
when that video is out then please
please please subscribe to my channel as
that would mean like so much to me hope
you enjoy this video oh my god I hope
you enjoyed this video I untied slip
Lego this first tumblr DIY is a chic
frame made from false eyelashes and
please make sure they are false first
you will need a plane frame a piece of
paper cut to size to fit the frame a set
of eyelashes and a pen clicking
arranging your eyelashes in rows of 3 or
4 depending on how many eyelashes you
bought I decide to go with a vertical
row of 3 and I decided to order them in
terms of how drastic they were so I
started off with a very simple design
and build them up to these crazy like
paper lashes do people actually wear
those things also cuz I thought that was
a bit too simple I decided to write a
tumblr / Pinterest at word above every
set of eyelashes so I will look chic and
vintage although you can really go crazy
with what words you want to use and
finally I put everything back into the
frame starting with you border then my
design and then the wooden backing for
support and also the frame was extremely
boring it was like just plain and white
so I got some eyes thick black and white
washi tape and I just placed that around
the frame and I just really like these
chic look and how it just brought the
whole design together
if you are hopeless out watering flowers
then this tumblr flower bouquet is
definitely for you and by the way quick
side note these do not look natural at
all but I like them like that you will
need some green cream blue or pink yarn
or wool some glue or sticky dots I
decided to use sticky dots and some
medium sticks that I picked for my
garden then begin wrapping the wall or
yarn around your fingers I would
recommend around 150 times although it's
completely up to you basically the more
times you wrap it around your fingers
the more full and luxurious your bouquet
of flowers will look
remember to wrap it around your fingers
loosely so that once you have finished
they will easily slide off your fingers
like so also you will need to cut off
another piece of yarn or wool and just
tie it as tightly as you can around the
center really really tight to make
things easy for myself I threaded my
fingers through each of the loops to
create a wide pathway for the scissors
to travel through and as I cut through
the loops you can actually see the
formation of the pom pom take place
now you can trim it a lot to make it a
perfect round ball but I wanted to make
it look a bit messy and uncap so I just
left it how it was as a huge fluff ball
so then all that was left to do was to
stick these stick on and I repeated this
process with all four and I absolutely
love how tumbler they turned out
now I'm very proud of this one because I
thought of it all by myself and it is a
tumble of switch cover using washi tape
now it is extremely straightforward but
I'm going to explain it anyway just in
case you're still a bit unsure all
you'll need is what your tape and a pair
of plain scissors you don't even need a
ruler for it all you need to do to
measure out how much was your tape you
need is to use the design on the washi
tape and just estimate it using that and
then stick it on I chose to ignore the
screw areas and the only bid that might
be an issue for you is where the actual
switch is so I just took the washi tape
over it like it wasn't even there and
then I got a pen and basically trace the
switch drawing a lines and then I got
appose scissors and cut through them
can you say
the final DIY I have for you today is
possibly the easiest one and is a tumblr
book word although if you are into
makeup it will most certainly be used
for storing pallets all you need for
this is a box to spray paint in some
metallic spray paint preferably gold or
silver and two medium sized rocks of
similar characteristics and we oh my god
wow that was a really big word for me
spray paint the top and sides of the
rock before letting it dry for about two
hours then return and spray paint the
bottom of the rock let it dry for
another two to three hours and then
finally it is ready to display in your
room people on Pinterest really seem to
like this DIY as I have seen it
everywhere so I hope that you did too as
I hope that you liked all of my other
DIYs too if you did like them please
