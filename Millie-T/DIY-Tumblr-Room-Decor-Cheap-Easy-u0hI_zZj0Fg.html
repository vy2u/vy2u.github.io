hello everyone its Milly so I worked
really really hard on this video and I
really hope that you enjoy what this
video has to offer I hope you get some
air
tips in this video some of them are
easier but for the majority of them
you'll need spray paint but if you have
spray paint you can use nail varnish or
acrylic paint anything like that or you
don't have to paint them at all if I'm
honest but anyway I hope you enjoyed
this video I filmed it outside in
England in the middle of winter because
it's January right now if you like
watching this in the future
mmm then it's a blue sky house happen
it's freezing I'm a handheld and they
were gonna drop off but now I'm back in
my room fluffy blanket fluffy Wednesday
fluffy sucks so I'm feeling well the
content and first DIY is going to be our
own jewelry holder or nail varnish
holder basically whatever you want to
put inside your DIY you will need a
thick photo frame a sharpie pen a ruler
some scissors and some wrapping paper or
a decorative cutout from vogue magazine
or basically any image that will fit
inside this bottle frame inside you
should have like a protective plastic
and a measurement sheet look on the
measurements and the sheet and you can
just measure them out onto the
decorative paper you want to use or you
can trace around it and I decided to be
lazy and just trace around it
then just cut out the paper that you
have chosen to use and we're going to
put it all into the frame so first of
all start with the measurement sheet
just the kind of extra support I guess
and then put the decorative paper in
facing upwards towards you and then so
the items have a proper base to sit on
put the protective plastic in last
this is what the final product should
look like and you can basically put
anything you want in there I put s in
nail polishes on there jewelry some
elephant candles and as you will see in
a minute I've burnt my finger
ouch
this next DIY is possibly one of my
favorites and all you need for this is 2
kilo jars or any jar mason jars
subjective ribbons LED candles any small
ornaments and some fillers for the jar
you will also need some spray paint some
sellotape and some superglue for added
decoration just place tape around the
areas where you want the spray paint to
avoid and basically in the end when you
peel a cell tape off this area will be
clear then just take your spray paint
and also stuff the middle of the jar so
that no spray paint gets it into the
inside of the jar and get spray painting
and I should have been wearing gloves
for Dahmer in the next clip I wear
gloves
and here are the gloves I decided to do
two jars because I'm definitely using
these DIYs in my room so I spray-painted
the other jar ain't baby blue color also
for the minute ornaments I decided to do
some old nail polish that I've had since
I was about five that I found the other
day but you can also use many animal
figurines or little toys you can find a
Power Man that will just fit on top of
the lids nicely so after your spray
paint and everything and it is all dry
just go ahead and peel the tape off from
the middle of the jars and you can just
place the LED candles inside and place
the filler and gems around that candle
so it looks very natural
I then also added ribbon around the
edges and bowls and I just think they
look so cute and hashtag tumblr so then
all you need to do is put super cool
around the rim of the little mini
ornaments and just stick them in the
center of the lid on wherever you want
to stick them on the lid and place it on
top of the jar and it will look like
that the ornaments could have done with
being a little bit smaller but overall I
am very happy with how it turned out I
absolutely love this next DIY it's a
display stand and basically cupcake
holder but it you can make it a display
stand for your makeup all you need is
two plates of different sizes any shape
really a mini vials or candle stick some
superglue and again I use spray paint I
do apologize for the being so much spray
paint but the spray paint is not
necessary it's just optional
so I went ahead and use the spray paint
on the dry on the end and it turned to
pink just kind of range the colors a
little bit and then take your superglue
once it's dried and just apply it to the
base of the valves or candlestick then
turn it upside down and place it into
this in the center of the larger plate
once that is dried apply super glue to
the rim of the top of the vase or
candlestick and apply the smaller plate
on the top in the center after that you
can use makeup nail polish lush bath
bombs whatever you want to accessorize
your display stand I think using your
everyday makeup will be extremely useful
as well just to kinda pick and go
I thought this was so creative and
inventive I'm going to need a cloudy
light bulb and a sharpie and you can
just go ahead and mic song lyrics draw
design stick stickers onto or anything
you want and basically when you place a
light book back into the lamp and turn
it on it will cast a shadow onto your
wall people have been creative with this
and drawn pizza pan onto the light bulb
and basically at night this is what the
effect is I highly recommend that you do
this next DIY if you do please don't go
to DM them to me on Instagram are you
going to need some fake flowers a coke
bottle or something similar and some
sellotape and some spray paint it's
really simple all you need to do is tape
sellotape and wrap it around a part of
the bottle that you don't want the spray
paint to get to so I chose to kind of
save the neck of the bottle here so that
I could add my ribbons and bows to that
area then you just take your spray paint
and spray the whole of the valve and I
put my finger like in the jar so that it
was just easier to kind of maneuver
once it is dried you can then just peel
the sellotape away from the neck but do
be careful when doing this because
sometimes more spray paint comes off a
new one and then you can just use some
decorative ribbons and bows to
accessorize it with that is the end of
the video guys I do hope you enjoyed it
it took me forever forever to make this
video so I really hope that you enjoyed
it if you tried out any of these designs
please DM them to Instagram and I'll
probably post them on my account
so yeah I love you all have a beautiful
day and don't get stay positive bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
