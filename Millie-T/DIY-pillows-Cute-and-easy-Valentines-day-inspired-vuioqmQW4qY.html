video basically my bed and my doll
time to spice it up but I think what he
needs
so first one sake paper
if you wanted your beanie simple design
and detail that maybe unicorn or maybe
something like that then you want to mix
this well I'm using a half so what I'm
going to be for the paper in half and
you'll have a heart starting point B and
spying pig so I have two and half my
heart there ninety-eight percent at the
time it turns out quite well so what you
do with this is put your heart and all
you do is put it out not need the inside
bit what you actually need is your
leftover paper you have so this is what
I'm going to use today the leftover
paper I have and it just make out the
shape in the middle as you can see makes
up part what you're going to do is to
get pillow here my position and you kind
of read into the paper waiting on the
heart to go
so it might about there and it's quite a
good bit actually
I just take up quite a bit of you and
all you want to do is find that down so
I'm going on that down right now okay so
if you want
tonight once the system has helped me
with the outsides so now I'm just
everything for the middle you got to get
the outsides and right because if they
go wrong then your pole shapes going to
be messed up so I am going your real
needs without seismic obviously the
middle area
what does have take caution
scissor has helped me well done this
violence on a pillow or actual part
financial but that's pretty cool is
going to a disturbance episode area that
like building a template and it asked my
really nice about this to us I might do
a second coat it's not depending on how
I feel but next thing I will do it's
right across the bottom that so let's
just wait this dry out
for tonight and I'm the magician gone
now because he did take quite a while to
drive where that's Phil tonight build a
video so here's the finished result of
my DIY pillows
look at that that what I did do was when
he was in Spencer no more strange any
bits around the edge sadness now I took
a fiddle lips pencil brush or a haze
which other one in my house I'm sweating
around my bed before and after now sorry
it's which shake yeah I'm doing it
handheld as you can see a purple pillow
is kind of featuring it kind of goes to
my walls and I also added this accent
over the top to go with it tis all cool
cold apart from a pillow and I think
that makes a great picture
I hope this gave you a few ideas did
them please thumbs up this video and
