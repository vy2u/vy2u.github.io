that I'd actually illegally be driving
this car before I pass my test you're
absolutely right is to come hi I am so
excited to finally be doing the drive
with me when he was my birthday last
September I was like I'm gonna nail
driving I'm gonna be on the road
cruising around in my car by December 5
failed very tests and four failed
driving tests later and here we are I
have my car but no license yeah my
second driving test I failed because I
didn't beat my horn at two kids on the
pavement to warn them not to cross cuz I
was about to turn into the side road as
if he's my job to warn them not to cross
like no children use what they taught
you at school put them skills to work
you know stop look listen if there's a
car coming stay on the pavement Oh
technically I should have already passed
my test but apparently I'm supposed to
honk my horn at random children on the
pavement sounds familiar I accept I
should be driving a white van logic I on
a car drive but I have my test tomorrow
or quarter past ten in the morning so
we'll see how that goes anyway whoa hear
that baby purr all cringe I decided it
would be a lot more enjoyable if I got
my mom in the car and didn't tell her
and just started driving to see a
reaction
we're gonna take really well do you like
it super honor yeah are you gonna get
that back in we'll find a way
you think it broken no I just seen your
half-wit forego enough to drive in it
you also know what you know fully get it
back on there we suck edgy teens
oh hey Siri call Childline sorry I'm
having trouble with the connection me
when a day goes wrong Cindy tweeted me
asking what secret skills do you have
nobody tweeted me but I just want to
show you this new skill here's some
lock-picking tools yeah shut up can you
give me encouragement what you can do it
[Laughter]
okay time for real talk now I know don't
actually
oboes me that scares me about driving is
that you're literally trusting everyone
so I literally have to trust every other
driver to not slightly turn their
steering wheel and crash into me and
literally screw up the rest of my life
kind of deep when you think vile I that
right yeah cuz you're literally in a
metal thing with wheels going 60 miles
an hour on a direct collision course to
another metal thing with wheels also
coming 60 miles an hour that you're
missing by a few feet speaking of uber
drivers I was in an uber the other day
and the car literally felt like it was
going to break it was on the motorway
going way faster than the car could
probably handle and I was like I don't
know this driver and I just have to
trust that he's not gonna kill me and
then I was just thinking about how much
things have changed I start to think
about like cell phones and mobile phones
and stuff
so imagine traveling back in time like
150 years ago and having your iPhone and
showing it to someone and being like
this is an iPhone this single thing can
connect you to anyone in the entire
world in a few seconds for basically
free and you can have a conversation
also you can be entertained for hours on
this phone and access a thing called
Google which tells you an answer to any
question in the world that you might
have basically google your question and
you'll get the answer in literally
seconds to anything
my mom's lived her life with and without
Google I wonder what she thinks you're
here because I have a question I was
just talking about Google and how win it
is right but you have like experience
life without Google whatsoever without
any internet and then you've experienced
it with Google as well do you not find
it like mind-blowing I see people on
television like yesterday on bake-off
but I'm like well you were there yeah I
google it and I can find out exactly who
they are they're an actor a singer
everything if I before I Google you just
thought they were there so Stephen
Hawking's recently died and I'm so sad
about that I literally love that guy so
much I'm acting like I knew him as a
friend like yeah we hung out every side
I know maybe even like I cheeky nandos
together or whatever and then I read his
book which is called a brief history of
time time really into space relativity
everything like that I absolutely love
so I read his book and I was mind blown
by it all it was written so well and I
was like this guy's literally incredible
so I loved him all the population it's
genuinely such a concern and no one
seems to care and he was also saying how
recently human population growth has
become exponential which means the
increases by the same percentage every
year and that's a high percentage point
two figures the population doubles every
forty years at the minute and that's
probably going to get faster but at this
rate by 2600 which actually isn't that
far away like it's a few hundred years
right earth will be so densely populated
that the population will literally be
standing shoulder-to-shoulder like there
will be no room and it said that we need
to leave Earth I think it's in the next
30 years or so which isn't an issue if
we can actually do that but where do we
actually go and how much is life could
have change because reasonably the thing
that's closest to us that we'd probably
moved to is the moon but obviously
doesn't have sufficient
oxygen levels the gravity is different
there's a lot of little complications a
which means that humans did after like
artificially adapt to it like wear suits
and all that kind of stuff like in
England we think that if someone lives
up north compared to down south they're
far away but imagine having a friend
that lives on the moon or something and
it sounds stupid like it seems like it
that would never happen but it literally
is gonna happen a big chunk of the
population need to leave this planet
soon because if they don't we're gonna
be screwed because we using up the
resources as it is our generation so
1990s - like 2003 I'd probably say are
the luckiest generation right because so
I'm mums generation didn't have social
media like we did they kind of struggle
they didn't have Google there to go to
school and learn from textbooks and the
new generation right now have social
media in my opinion way too early like
from the ages of four they're watching
YouTube and Toys R Us is shutting down
and all this kind of stuff like their
actual childhood like playing out going
to the park and stuff isn't as common
and that's really sad like it's kind of
been taken away for our generation in my
opinion anyway this is completely just
my opinion I feel like we were that
perfect balance we got that childhood
where we'd leave our house we probably
didn't have a phone at age like seven
eight so we'd have to literally go on
physically knock on a friend's house and
go out and play on the park or whatever
and also a playboy as well but then when
we were old enough when we like entered
high school such like a few years into
high school we got into like iPhones
iPhones became like a bigger thing again
this is just my age you probably
experience it like give or take a few
years we had iPhones to then go into
social media and have access to Google
to like help was with homework and
whatever we wanted to find out like we
literally have Google if you want to
learn a new language you can go onto
Google and learn that language very
quick if you put in enough effort this
is a kind of funny mind-blowing one but
you know how DNA tests are becoming kind
of like a trend to do like youtubers
will do a DNA test to find out their
heritage and all that kind of thing I
told my mom and I was like let's see if
this has an issue with it because
imagine if you've seen tea mom I'm gonna
do a DNA test and she's like no no no
you know no you're not but I don't do
that and then you find out you're
adopted cuz you get you results and it's
like you TAS called Gerald and it's from
Sweden and you're like that's not the
dad that I knew I want to laugh but I
know I shouldn't oops
future history classes in school are
going to be
so fun like imagine learning about this
generation going onto Twitter and like
the history of memes and stuff like what
this channels gone through a lot of
phases right it started off as a
gymnastics channel I will not talk about
that phase then he went on to typical
2013 YouTube which was this or that tag
come a white girl tag the most boring
stage of YouTube looking back but at the
time I enjoyed doing it then I turned
into a reaction channel and then I got
onto like testing weird things on this
channel I've enjoyed all of those phases
so much and that's why I did them
however I think now is a time for this
channel to enter a new phase and I hope
you guys will stand by me with it but
this channel is gonna become something a
little bit different I'm excited for it
I know something that I have to do this
is what I want to do this channel I kind
of want to have quite a few ongoing
series on it of different things and
have a very diverse a paranormal series
where me and my friends will go and
explore the most haunted hotels in
London and then even maybe exploring
mental asylums if it involves that much
I hope so that would be really cool also
maybe a lie detector series with
different people in it
podcasts are genuinely something that
might happen in the future like legit
podcasts like on iTunes and Spotify kind
of thing but I also want to do a
different kind of version of podcasts
which is just from what bangs well like
I eat and talk and storm it sounds so
weird what I say it sounds like a kink
when I say like that one it's like
really not but I'd want to do that with
like friends get different people
involved make it like a podcast where we
spill really interesting stories about
each other where we talk about YouTube
whatever but we like eat whilst doing it
so it's as if you just kind of get to
witness a normal conversation for us if
that makes sense so yeah my channel's
gonna kinda take a turn but I'm really
looking forward to it like I never want
to do something just for views because
that's not gonna last long that's just a
temporary thing I want to really build a
connection with you guys I have a vlog
channel take a shot every time I've
mentioned that on this channel I'm
literally not talking about it's a promo
II I just want to talk about the channel
is elf I'm not saying that's promo away
I just want to talk about the channel
itself I adore my vlog channel so much I
just appreciate the community on that
channel you guys are so loyal on that
channel and it actually like warms my
heart so much I cannot even begin to
talk about it it late makes me so happy
because that channel is so personal
nice skip to the bus are you kidding me
are you serious I'm trying to play this
song um
yellow do you see this and this and that
I can't even wide this as well as
literally leaving grease stains hope you
enjoyed this drive with me join me on my
next one where I can hopefully drive
legally</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
