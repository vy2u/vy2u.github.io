know that I am really really late with
this video but it has been requested
whose recent like for me to do this
video and the eos versus Baby Lips and I
don't know why all of a sudden I've been
getting so many requests for this
particular video I don't know but let's
get going with it yeah I kind of got a
big tongue twister oh I'm gonna go let's
get started but then I decided to go for
let's get going so I've been doing a lot
of research on this video in preparation
so I put a page full notes which I
always do for my videos but I don't know
there's just so many mixed views I just
wanted to get this video right and just
comment below who you think has won this
battle so first of all we are going to
start by talking about the EOS lip balms
and in the post and the comments so
we're gonna talk about the packaging
that's the first thing I think about the
packaging of your weight on the positive
side is that it is very colorful so for
me you've got blue obviously and this is
strawberry I think and first up you've
got red I mean you've got orange for
orange and just obvious colors like that
and I just think it's great because of a
great new makeup collection and then
Java something like that just stacks up
because it's just difficult isn't it
adds that like pop of color to your room
so I just think it looks really nice for
the different cause and also it's a very
unique shape like it's in the shape of a
and a lot of lip balms are in the shape
of this like just kind of a tube type
thing okay so that is the basics on the
pros of the packaging so now I'll talk
about the actual okay the best thing is
the smell and now that's this really pro
or con
the smell is okay so this one is sticks
it's absolutely disgusting and I hate
the smell of this it's just at the mint
one I absolutely love
so nice I would really say smells not
what chip meant like you know stuff
minutes or anything like that
well this eight smells like a min flat
that is really the old approach to the
EOS underneath cons of the packaging is
that they are very hard to store like I
know it's good that they are the unique
shape but they are very difficult to
stop the main reason is because they are
so big like that can be bit off but they
are a bit hard to and carry around when
did that come to the packaging is that
it gets so puffy so easily
now can you comment below if you agree
with me on these folks I don't know if
it's just for me cuz I'm just only tied
you mess it but I always find that the
packaging gets so away with that one
there don't if you'll be able to tell
but it is got so so rub it and by the
way I have like I don't know why my hand
is all green boy I was born with it that
they are basically the cons of packaging
basically too big I make it really good
easily and the meat and cons about the
product itself it's ID is very very
greasy like if you just watched on the
back of your hand it is really really
greasy and then it also I don't know if
you guys know this but all like bombs
especially yo s I'm contain and
ingredient and I care about what the
ingredient was called what its meaning
yeah but it's an ingredient that dries
your lips out basically it makes you
soft for quite a while and then just
completely transform ow and the idea of
that is you go put it on yo oh my god my
lips so soft this is really really good
and then you like oh no it's about
drying dynamics but more on and lower
and I'm Lauren and Lauren in law
anyway and then just I just think that
and then we thank media might this be
explained it's not you two so much you
can sell anything
wait moisturizing a lip so I gotta go
out and get more I say the old takes the
same I know I don't go around spoon and
eat it but when it's on your lips you
obviously going to be able to taste it
because you know the lips about Tom is
very very bubbles
yeah they do taste very nice
okay so now I'm up to the fabulous so
first of all we'll start with the pros
so the first one I'm the first pro about
the packaging that it is very very
secure and there's no chance that only
coming up if you can hear it clicks
together so there isn't a chance because
not really unless you what if you do any
custom events
it's also very good quality and that
relates to be able to be a regal quality
packaging like this would be hard
distance
and sweetheart as much like if you only
to squeeze these types of plastic lids
they kind of bendable this light doesn't
at all and also with the product
what do you mean thing that I liked
about it is that you get a lot so you
don't get a pump again you get a lot of
really fun
and also you do get a lot in the EOS as
well but they are just there and also I
don't know
this felt really really good like they
smell really nice a big one it smells
exactly like the EOS one and playing
kind of wants out for words like to cool
it on like cat village intense camp
looks like that they don't really have
any
with a hydrate was well-spent much they
probably lasted about an hour to an hour
and a half which isn't great why I mean
actually finish and feel you'll still be
able to feel mad when they've not be
able like breakfast like that will still
be able T to be a lead on that which I
think it's really good feeling from
because I know that it's not like
lipsticks right they'll stay on there
but they themselves see lips so first
one and the comment about the packaging
is that I know I'm in a bit but
physically and I'm saying that it was
really cool but it is a bit loose on the
packaging and what I'm talking about two
completely different things before I was
talking about this bit here what this
like as you can see I'm leaving that I
don't think the world to tell
I'm leavin that a lot well like that's
not going up so it is a bit loose there
so that it next in case anyone has a lot
another thing that I found really really
disappointed about these what's up in
America you're so lucky one who's to
make this so much to hope that is here
and like all the countries but in a
mighty UK and the electro once the
doctor jury but you get so much variety
in the UK I think I'm finish I have not
seen anything anywhere and you only get
playing time you sit down with a writer
with them I just try out an electro lip
balm or talk to you I don't know I just
want to try when I miss you so much
and another thing that I'm right about
this and the EOS far as I said last is
how they kind of sit on your lips
and then also I will find that the peach
kiss one but it's meant to be cool it
won't work how hideous is that cooler
way expense me I mean I will find that
cool on my lips but I mean if it's meant
to be purple and that's a pretty hideous
cool so know we are on to my conclusion
so all in all I would say that I prefer
baby lips I always I always have and I
always will
I don't hate us in any way at all unless
in any way shape or form but I have been
known to myself cuz I hate it with so
many because I say in any way shape or
form and it's just like gave me remind
our phrasing it's just a silly man what
I probably say I prefer the baby lips
and out of the two I don't hate us at
all as far as the lip balms go like my
opinion these are pretty crap the really
good for the smell will go for the
packaging and and then the really good
for the color the look and they're very
popular so that they might be the
reasons why I might get them I city
facts that they do include a drying
ingredient it's been proven by
scientists it's on the packaging not the
packaging of this but like it's on the
Box on you up and things are huge in the
products they find work and for you but
for my lips definitely definitely
but they do add really nice color I
especially love the color that the pink
eventually you say I'm not a bad price
for Maybelline and I know you can get
and chapsticks feel like a pound or a
dollar fifty or a delight and oh hero
five cents but I just like there are a
really good price and in my opinion
three lip balm from kind of a jokester
from quite a well-known brand and but
the EOS that's six pounds here for one
lip balm and they do have a lot of
product their last a long time but I
will be buying anymore yo s lip balms
anytime soon and the baby lips I think
I'm creating what stocked up for the
rest of my life with these used to
actually do moisturize your lips I would
say that Nivea kind of works better but
I don't know if I'd recommend them one
night it's kind of 50/50 so that was my
new view on iOS versus Baby Lips and I
would say baby lips has won this battle
