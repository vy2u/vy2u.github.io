my EOS lip-balm to come through in the
post and it's finally finally going
through so I'm putting around here now
I'm a good woman because and the box
feels really light so I hope they've
included all three lip balms I bought
two for myself and one for the giveaway
and so yeah let's open it so this is
what it looks like and just come in the
mail so as you can see I've got the
different flavors here and also it's
come with these like foam pieces here to
keep it safe so I'll move on to showing
you which one I'll be giving away and
also which one so what flavors and what
I think of them like the review and also
me trying them for the first time
because I have never tried them before
so it'll be quite interesting so they
are here in my hand right now and my
dog's looking at something I really want
to know what it's thinking oh hey c-can
I want to get down
so anyway so here I have strawberry
sorbet so that's the strawberry sorbet
one bye bye charlie um so that's Joey so
may I also have pomegranate which is
this one here and the finally I bought
Sweetman which is this one here so I'm
going to try out all the lip balms and
more than two of them and see what I
think of them and by the way I'm giving
away the strawberry sorbet one which is
the light pink one if you don't know
which one that is send rewind it it's
this one here this color do you like
your tummy yeah so is this one M like
this I'm giving this one away in a
previous giveaway this isn't a giveaway

enter it and includes this lip balm here
and so now I'm going to try them out and
now I've seen a lot of other videos on
YouTube like opening and review toilet
take your sock
nope don't like me opening AOS and then
the review of it and and quite a few
times I've seen people open it it's like
an egg shape I've seen people open it
and then what's happened is that is
broken ha
and so I've opened one there and this is
the next one the material around it like
the container it's like quite improper
II feel T I don't know how to explain it
really so now I will zoom in and show
you me opening basic bars so apparently
the best way to open a OS lip balm for
the first time is twist it slowly and
then pull because a lot of people have
had this um broken half and that's not
very good so I'll start off with these
two everyone because if this job you're
on breaks and I'm up you as upset a
minute on because I'm just heard so many
good reviews on the mid 1 so slowly
there we go
why fig yellow side hmm
dinner didn't really smell of
strawberries smells if like I don't know
it reminds me of something now usually
it looks like like an egg shape it looks
white on the camera but it's actually
fair yellow um and then the lid like
that um it's really nice actually the
smell book it's all right don't smell
this job yourself and playing it
it goes onto your lips really easily
really smooth as well that's nice dude
oh yeah it does that's a really nice
taste actually we're sucking it off my
lips that's really nice taste mmm yeah
that's that's nice and smells nothing
special really
and what tasting of good tastes good it
tastes really nice
so now just one yeah I'll show you me
opening it yeah it hasn't broken but all
last night that's really nice
okay he's really really nice oh that is
nice right yeah
apparently this one makes your lips
tingle after a bit like couple of
seconds hmm no exactly tingling okay now
it's tingling a bit it's like not
cooling down your lips I well more like
cooling sensation on your lips if any of
you have the elf plumping blaze up glass
which is one weights plumping on one
side and then color on the other radical
on either then you'll know what I mean
by it really really tingles your lips
but it feels nice as well
that's just right act like they might
have that tingles it's really nice
I've never had a OS before now I know
that's quite that'd be quite strange to
anyone who's awake and watching this
because it's a kind of big thing in the
Moka
but like um no one really has EOS in the
UK cuz there's nowhere to buy it and bit
like there's a lot of Maybelline Baby
Lips in the UK but nothing else really
like not know us and that's quite oh
they look quite feel the lip balms but
probably the lips is the best one
personally I prefer TOS to baby lips but
that's just an opinion like obviously
people if she's still really good be
able if she's got all this tingling
Mabel it's just really good fur color
and I suppose EOS is good for like
applying and me oh and if it tastes
anyone Noel a taste for anything that
may want I think this dog blue ones so
everyone's better taste and the mint one
is better for smell so again so thank
you for to this video please click on my
channel to enter the giveaway and I've
already said but it is actually good for
your benefit as well so um yeah this
I'll be giving away the strawberry so
sorbet and black pink 100 this video
I've been saying that this is strawberry
it's not this is pomegranate and sea
pomegranate and yeah that's probably
granite now it makes more sense with the
smell this is pomegranate um so I'm not
going to be giving away this one I'm
going to be giving away
this one are still wrapped up so yeah
please add to my giveaway on my channel
thank you for watching and I'm going to
go and smell this mint cos I buff
somewhat because it smells really good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
