drop-off page this is like a big cloud
in a big slow noble thing is you like a
lot of volume I like an edit with my
hair Jacqueline did a tweet saying that
we are going to be collabing we were
supposed to collab like it in the house
so this one is going to be real life
would you rather which basically means
that whichever one we choose we actually
have to do so oh you won't be like would
you rather lose a limb or lose like a
toe it's going to be something more and
less brutal than that so I give stream
at the same time yeah oh good good
public at midnight I'm sure with food
yeah before we start this video we
filmed a video on saffron channel Alex
and what it was yeah basically we
haven't even sold yet but because we
probably get any throwing up so the my
favor of a girl warning so we're pretty
excited for next week minute a while is
weird is a much the excites to fill
their same yeah I am - yeah would you
rather going through a clothing store
hiding in Iraq and yell pick me at
people yelling and say why are the same

there today wearing get false eyelashes
as a mustache and else nose hair like
roses when okay the clothing rag so I
have to do that yeah great you're gonna
have to do that right guys we have
arised
at the shopping mall and I'm about to do
most fun
yeah technically my dad you know
probable to do this yeah I got a height
in a clothing rack and then arsenic me
I'm really so good hoping some protects
me in she goes
now that I took me I'm in the thing I'm
the black legging and the grace 91 it's
me
trying to play cultural integral would
you rather cross the road and break out
into a dance for while she was crossing
the road eh eh in the middle everybody's
break out or just simple as are for
example I'm the algebra voice and listen
if he rejects me those reviews or you
want to get rid Jensen well it's a
possibility and another I'm not risking
it as I'm going to go into the road and
very going to that so we are at the
crossing and now I put a great cow into
dance and affixed realize a girlfriend
which also crossing that I know of
anyway so okay ready yeah
yeah yeah would you rather ya stand in a
crowded place walk behind someone right
behind them and start having an argument
with yourself not on the phone just
talking to yourself having a argument as
if you two people in one body or would
you rather superglue a this one isn't
too bad but it might be a bit boring
typically a coin to the floor and yeah I
don't you want to do the old one one
looking but imagine even imagine maybe
like the absence of Mary Kingston yeah
all of you know ok ok ok guys right now
I'm going to stand in the way of
everybody and have a firm or group
myself this will be acting game comes in
let's go
okay really this is necessary notice how
when she starts having the argument the
guy on the right stands up and literally
just stares at her stands and stares at
her for a good like 30 seconds and then
also how people just realize you're
speaking to yourself get a bit concerned
and just casually just walk off and
leave

actually hate it I hate you more
