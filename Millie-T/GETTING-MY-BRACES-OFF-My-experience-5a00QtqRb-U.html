look at my face my braces have finally
come off when I say finally I happen at
the mall for the longest time think
about the one for about a year and a
half now or exactly a year and a half I
got them on SEP 10 to the 16th 2013 and
it's just now March the 27th 2015 so
it's been about a year and a half which
isn't a huge like really long time so no
so hopefully like half the ones like
eight years but you get bored of him
pretty quickly actually the last time I
went to my orthodontist which is like a
few months ago I thought that I'd get
them off then so I started a vlog and
everything you never even told me I just
got my hopes up way too high but I like
started filming a vlog and I was like
you know yep today I'm hoping I'll get
my braces up hopefully and then I never
did and I was like distraught about it
and it just kind of infuriated because I
get my hopes up way too high and I got
my hopes up like this high for the past
like four appointments and I thought
like I might get them off of this one I
might not I wasn't really too sure so
yeah the previous time that I went I
really thought that I'd get them off I
didn't end up getting them off but I
thought that I get them off this time
and they're not I kind of thought about
it I was like hang on I might not so I
went today and he said a lemon down on
the okay what's prefer is but I live out
on the dentist chair and then he looked
at my teeth and everything kept asking
me to buy it together what he instead of
just once asking me to buy it together
to check my overbite he asked me about
six times I was like oh my god he's
asking me this many times he's probably
just like checking CPAP and get them up
or not and by the way I'm I'm a very
very impatient person and I talk really
quick so sorry about this but I'm really
excited oh happy I'm happy
I'm happy it's gonna be I'm happy pirate
happy happy Larry and then you said
you'll have two more appointments after
this and I was like oh my gosh two more
very mind that each appointment here in
the UK at my dentist comes everything
about every three months that I may not
have to wait another six months to get
them off so I was not prepared to do
that and
I don't cry a lot at all I never cry
anything like the only feeling I've
acquired is Molly and me and that's
because the dark look looks identical to
Charlie my dog golden retriever it's a
Labrador very similar dogs so anyway
it's just like I'd like a knock on
reaction that I had a like as tis like
okay now like oh my god
and then he said to me it was like you
know what if you want the look straight
and they look like really well aligned
but they could be perfect if you just
wait a little bit longer now it's up to
you you can have them off now or you can
wait and I thought well if he's give me
option to have them off now then clearly
they look all right you know then
clearly he thinks it's do look
acceptable tab off now so I was like
take him off now so they gave a form to
my stepdad and asked him to sign it so
he did and then I caught them off
basically if you really want your braces
off and your teeth are straight and you
know for a fact they are and the reason
you wanted me to wait was because my
very back teeth the brackets fell off
and I didn't have them put on for a
while and he said but you better off
having the brackets put back on your
back teeth and wait for him to go
straight so you teef it all straight and
I was like but when you smile you people
people only see the first six teeth in
your mouth and if it's like the very
back teeth then no one notices those
sounds like you know what just take him
off a real knocker so he took them off
and I'm so so happy about it now Lucas
now the procedure he went through to
take them off it was basically he has a
slight clip I like flicks each break it
up like it's quite cool and flicks him
off then puts him on this table collects
them all together public it's from in a
jar or something
I'm joking he does not do that oh my god
not to the bunny face without my braces
on ah oh my god you look so different
okay if you watch my food I can't even I
can't hold it on anything if you watch
my videos or what you know that I do
that face a lot and then he got this
really really powerful one and it's so
on that it like crying to get into teeth
H it does of her at all just really
comfortable and it's a cat I just keep
sending constant chills through your
body just feels awful it's just oh it's
just a really cringey like feeling and
then after that he had this like brush
that he pushed through my teeth and just
that just gets rid of all the glue that
they had a mutti because when you get
braces it's some pretty damn strong glue
glue that last two years give or take if
your bracket breaks when you eat an
apple or something
but if glue that laughs about two years
without like coming loose or without
weakening is pretty impressive without
strong the glue is so it's going to take
quite a procedure to get them off again
now what I'm going to do from here is
I'm going to use the down smell wine and
kits that I paid for it's not like a
group sponsored review or anything and
I'm going to whiten my teeth with them
and I probably should do it straight
away but I'm impatient I've said
multiple times so quite frankly I'm
going to do it right now I'm going to
wipe them straight after this video so
yeah I'm so happy so so happy I also a
lot of people report alike with the mix
of saliva and also the stop your teeth
doing looking slightly yellow so I think
might do a little bit do look a bit
yellow actually but and they will be
white soon enough for white in them and
that's
mutters now after I got them off he put
this more like if your have braces on
now you'll you know the mold that you
get when you get any braces it's like a
jello mold and it's like if the fingers
I got the back II throw and it like
chokes hearing you're like stop gagging
and it's all disgusting well it's like
that but it's not as bad and it kind of
tasted nail varnish remover I'm not a
very nice ASAP so and a nice to get your
retainer but I'm going to land rot it on
Sunday for ten days and I booked an
appointment for when I am still on
holiday because I got confused with the
times and I forgot when mum about the
holiday for so I was all confused so I'm
going to have to reboot my poem for the
retainer and I'm just hoping that my
teeth don't move back in like two weeks
which they shouldn't do like not
completely anyway you might do like the
slightest bit for the routine we'll just
put it back to how they were anyway if
you are getting racist now oh sorry the
Lighting's a bit messed up or using
natural lighting the struggle if you're
getting braces right now just enjoy them
yes you'll get impatient with them
you'll be in a rush to get them on and
then when they run you'll want them
straight up again want achieve even just
starts look straight you decide you know
these are relatively straight Atkins
okay I'm alcohol with this and done
without you can just take them off now
but the ostrich is absolute
perfectionist and they no matter what
they will not let you have your braces
off until your teeth look suitable to
get them off and they want this to be
perfect but not other people with the
braces on oh just slight you know what
they looks true as long as the first
like 82 straight it's fine I'm not
bothered so yeah I do hope that you
enjoy this video and tell me what you
think I did look all right like do I
look different
do I look like retarded I don't really
know have a beautiful day and don't get
stay positive
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
