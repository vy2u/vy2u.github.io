basically allows up to six players to
play one game and you don't even have to
worry about controls or anything because
you just have to download an app on your
smartphone and then your smartphone
becomes your controller in this video

favorite games which is called a frantic
s-- frantic is a new game which is out
now and it's launching as part of the
plain link range exclusive to the
PlayStation 4 so it's pretty special
however saying that there are a range of
games available on the PlayStation Store
all you have to do is download that game
and then also download the accompanying
app on your smartphone and you're good
to go

for PlayStation UK for their new range
of cleaning games however you guys know
that I would never ever ever work with a
brand that I didn't believe in and this
is PlayStation it's reputable everyone

it as well so I was like there's no
reason to say no to this say yes to new
opportunities in life I have no idea
