outfits I like quite plain colors and
for my face it's more colorful and I
love these shorts because the color
combination makes you look very tan
which is always useful in the summer
and I chose this necklace because the
pattern matches to one of my shorts and
also I have two earrings on the collar
to keep it held down so that's why
they're bare
do you like the freckle on my little
finger
so for this look I'm using the naked 2
palette to do my eyebrow I am using the
color boosted which is the one in the
center
this mascara is my Holy Grail mascara it
really does make it look like you have a
million lashes and I love my spider
lashes and you'll see in the next clip
but that is exactly what I achieved by
applying this mascara the lipstick I'm
using for this is pink poodle by Mac and
is a really really vivid pink color so
it's definitely useful for the
summertime and I also am using the
Rimmel stay matte foundation just
because it is such a good full coverage
which means that it will give you that
flawless finish and this is my makeup as
a whole
next thing on my sim a list is flawless
like so to achieve this I used to be wax
trips the process of applying these
definitely does not tickle but your legs
stay hell is for about two weeks which
is fantastic compared to shaving waxing
is very rough on your legs as well so
you do need to use a really good
moisturizer preferably with SPF for the
summer time
to finish it off I do like to add body
shimmer as it gives the effect of longer
legs
beat you age is a huge thing in the
summertime and dry shampooo gives you
that texture that you'd need to achieve
that it also smells of pineapples
pineapples is good but on a more serious
note we do need to protect our eyes on
the Sun so I'm just putting on some
sunglasses that matches my lipstick as
well as some perfume that smells of
flowers so nice we're like pineapples
flowers and cream great
my dog is also keeping over the latest
fashion trends and that is the end of
