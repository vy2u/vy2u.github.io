actually feel myself getting my eyelash
extensions done but that clip is that
the end of the video if you want to stay
tuned for that
also I aside a second channel that I'm
going to be using for vlogging so if you
wanna get so me off as a person feel
free to subscribe to that the link will
be in the description of course for like
the top or maybe the second line I know
I also have to get on snapchat to Semyon
questions to in my allergic tension so
I'm going to be answering them right now
enjoy how long they take to get done
usually I think they take around 45
minutes to an hour but that time goes so
fast and it's so relaxing like it feels
like it's taking about two minutes it's
great what clothes my underwear okay
where did you get them done you played
tonight got my eyelash extensions done
is called multi nails and beauty and
it's even muscles also if you live near
very Berlin even Manchester then it's
such an amazing place I really really
really recommend that you golf because
there's all my nails eyelashes and
anything it's called Rebecca she is
actually amazing but I've never had a
bad experience I'm always so so chuffed
with everything that I get done this is
a social media if you want to go and ask
her about getting anything cause I
recognize her so much so much how do you
feel about anyone's fake eyelashes now I
can speak from experience on this one
because I bought some kind of closest
false eyelashes so it's like a cluster
of two eyelashes and then you can stick
them onto your natural lashes and it
become like a light extension face
equivalent DIY I got them after watching
a YouTube video as well I did to myself
the two pages when I did them and I was
really happy with them if you weren't or
what they look like when they were done
and watch my snapchat has video for
reference because I have been known when
I film a video I I didn't
I was happy with how they walked when it
came taken them off I used all your line
item is not a coin actual eyelashes
literally in half literally in half I
was absolutely busted how much are they
again it depends where you go when I
went there were 45 pounds to get in your
last all set first and which is
expensive however it doesn't work out
too expensive if you can't get it done
because to get them filled in it's like
20 pounds I think it was so if you
dedicate to have an eyelash extensions
you don't work out that expensive and
remember that you also pay for the
quality if you're paying five pounds
roundish extensions I'd be careful
did they hurt when you've got them no
not all is such a relaxing process I
mean the place where I went is anyway
you look down on a bed in like a room
and that's like meditation music on as
well you lay down have your eyes closed
and she just applies them and it doesn't
hurt to apply that at all it just
literally this one's like stroking
natural eyelashes I fell asleep
about four times when I got them done
however you hadn't done for
I got until last week so I've had enough
like around a week can you feel when
mascara over the top of them you can put
done because I think well photon tonic
and eyelash extensions is so you don't
have to wear Skara over the top of them
and so the disc you know you can gallop
and go basically and I know for play
mascara all the top of Sony bear pit and
scar off at some point
I like onto taking them off to the
product you're going to probably take
off some of the islands extensions along
with the mascara so I don't know it just
seems a bit pointless to add mascara to
me and also if you use a product with
oil in it take them off it's going to a
weakening bond between your extensions
and your natural eyelashes so if you
wanted to ask your mascara in terms of
all the eye products you can wear an
eyeshadow and eyeliner with them as well
but it's just a bit of a pain to get off
and also use an oil-free makeup remover
to take them off so that you don't
weaken the glue bond again what
something that you can do is where
possible scar easily bottom ascaris
thing that I always wear with them some
when I was also asked whether you can
choose what kind of a light extensions
in one or whether it depends on the
shape of your eye again exchanges with
whatever place you go to but
I don't they and do it to have whatever
fits your eyes s so your natural
eyelashes how they are with the curls
are not curled will do a lot extensions
to match then just only normal to odd
and you can ask for them to be very full
or not very full you can ask them to be
low or not very long what is also limits
to them as well do I like extensions
irritate your eyes unless you're
allergic to the glue no not at all like
I you have a glue test before you get
them done anyway if you go to a
reputable place and I was allergic to
the glue it was all fine the only thing
that the going did was when I was
getting done and I opened my eyes to the
first time the gloom kind of perfume can
you can you know the only what happens
when open my eyes after an hour having
shown getting the allergies that applied
and this fume from the gloom or
identified it was sorry I started
watering didn't seeing anything we just
went slightly when started watering like
that went within 10 minutes and what's
the bad thing about having a lot
extensions your problem with them is
we're going to sleeping on them you've
got to be so so careful if you sleep on
them the global change shades like
crisscross over each other which I guess
quibble board if you will going like a
splendid look but another thing you're
going to do is also be very careful in
the shower you can't get them wet and
well you can but you're going to try to
keep to a limit and that's everything I
can think of in terms of light it's bad
things about them and what do you people
are asking how I did it I didn't do them
I got unprofessional indoor don't do
them yourself unless you want your
natural eyelashes to be cut in half it's
not a good thing how long will they last
for they will last for 10 to 15 days
them being so full I line wishes along
and I know when your natural eyelashes
start to shedding like this shedding
cycle natural process cycle thing and
the extensions will fall out with them
or very gradually I think you can
probably wear them for about a nice
bedroom do they fall out yes sometimes
fitting no I told while earlier because
the shape of it was so like weird that
is everything for today's video on the
Q&amp;amp;A enjoy the little quick week and go
about it from me in person face to face
or like
this kind of space to pay so yeah enjoy
the clip have a beautiful day I live
life bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
