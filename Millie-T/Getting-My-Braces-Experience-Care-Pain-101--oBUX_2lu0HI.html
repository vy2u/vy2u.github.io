hello everyone if you've clicked on this
video you are either curious about
braces getting braces or getting them
off or currently have braces I think
I've just kind of named every single
option you could have okay
anyway as you are watching this video if
you do enjoy this video or you like me
then please hit the subscribe button
below that'll mean so so much to me and
that do whatever you want to comment
below anything okay so the person that
I'm going to talk about is getting your
braces on so I just have to say getting
braces on does not hurt one single bit
gay finger hold your finger up now sit
okay now queefing got on your teeth and
push right that doesn't hurt depending
on how hard you're pushing but if you
just push a little bit doesn't hurt and
ice basically it ought to do they have a
metal bracket they get the metal bracket
put glue on your teeth and they press
the bracket onto each tooth individually
and they get away and they wrap it
around do not be nervous I swear to you
it will not hurt so first of all getting
your braces so you go to the dentist
you'll get appointment whenever you're
going you'll see you down the chair and
again as I was saying before he'll get a
Mac in metal bracket
what about each individual tooth and
then the lady always assistant on mail
system will show you a range of
different colors you can have your
braces so I know Christmas people get
red green red green
I personally stick to neutral colors
like purples and reds and just colors
like that you choose buy them and it'll
use that and I'll just wrap it around
each brace and what it does that wire
but the other wire it pushes your teeth
together and that is why it gets painful
a bit after a few days you get braces
for arrange different things
I got racist because I had a over by a
big overbite and also this front tooth
here was overlapping this tooth and it
was a like a lot for the forward than it
should be so after you get your braces
are healed public if
start to pack off Latour you buy one I
had to buy one but I know like dentists
actually give you the pack an impact you
will get a toothbrush as a simple
toothbrush you will get some plaque
tablets and what these are is my light
purple tablets and what you do is after
you brush your teeth you chew on one
you'll rinse your mouth out about five
times with water then you'll look in the
mirror and anywhere that's got any
purple bits anywhere on your teeth
that's marked purple that means that you
still got plaque there so you just push
it up and that ensures that you brush
your teeth as well as we can you also
get a tiny little toothbrush and nice to
get in between the brackets because in a
regular toothbrush can't get in between
and obviously if you want to prevent
getting squares on your teeth which is
basically when you get your braces off
and you've got like little square marks
and your teeth if you didn't brush
properly you really don't want that
trust me
although don't think it's that common
thing you have to like never brush your
teeth to get that you'll get some
fluoride mouthwash and I think that was
everything I've got them I think I was
everything I got in my pack and I've
just got a few bits and baths there some
people might get more stuff in the pack
but yeah and less I'll just say it
anything else I get in pictures or
anything that's everything that you get
the pack my insider heading after a day
when I woke up the next morning if your
teeth ache a lot and it's not like
shooting pain I wouldn't get ears
pierced or anything just my aching I own
your muscles like something it's like
that with your teeth and you'll just
have to kind of stick to liquid foods
like soup Oh drink a lot things like
that the something you can do to prevent
the pain as far as I know yeah because
it's just your teeth eight or something
like cream you can put on your teeth or
anything so you just have to deal with
it but then after about two days or so
it will completely die down and you'll
just be left with braces like how the
normally look and trust me they will do
their work okay after about two months
or three months I saw this tooth like it
completely changed it was just right
extra attitude so then in terms of care
forever after those days when this top
certain and everything brush two to
three times a day and carry around if
you've got you can get like I think they
do a Primark if you like
in America then you evaluate at Walmart
or for your get them out wash you can
get them anyone they can put in your
jacket pocket or bag or whatever when
you go to school like your home school
just keep on your bedside table or
whatever and and you can just rinse your
mouth out with that so after you've had
your dinner or breakfast just get it on
wash your mouth out but also after
you've brushed your teeth do not rinse
it out with water Internet out with
water just basically like removes all
the toothpaste bats you're back to
square one with it old though also when
you drink fizzy drinks drink them for a
straw because I found when you drink
through a straw it completely misses
your teeth like literally oh hello focus
Vulcan realize there ain't nothing
nothing like them
we have braces you can still eat chewing
gum chewing gums on it yes you just chew
chewing gum we disengage stop to brace
or anything after you've kept your ears
and everything like that out while you
doing that you'll have a check with a
dentist every three month or basically
you're cute the brackets on you just
keep the brackets on forever I'm sorry
that my Rangers don't know why I'm
Orange
you always keep brackets on and all it
does is you take off the wire and you
plated it and every time you in replaces
it you get a new choice of color and
whatever you want the colors kind of
range some dentists have like the full
range of colors like complete full range
my dentists have like purple pink green
blue just kind in basic colors although
I did want kind of an invisible like a
transparent wire but because I want my
braces to be as late least because I
want my braces three is not noticed as
possible so yeah and then eventually
after you keep getting checkups still be
fine you'll just keep doing anything and
sometimes a bracket might come loose and
come off and then you'll just have an
emergency appointment at the dentist
well just put it back on I it's as
simple as that
and then eventually the day will come
where you can get your braces off isn't
that marvelous
some dentists give you an appointment
like you know you get in your braces off
the 27th of June of and all the dentists
will say you know the looking good let's
see how they're doing next time it's
