button PS I decided to upload a video
because I know a lot of you well I'd
want your belly button pierced or I'll
get in your belly button this or maybe
you clicked on this video for no reason
just because you bought and going on a
YouTube spree well yesterday I kind of
had like an on-the-spot idea I was like
hey I want it done so my mom she was
like no and then I explained to her a
bit more about how I'm going on holiday
tomorrow out to 16th holidays so it'll
have time to recover she was like well
no eyes open thinking you'd wanna I was
like yes there is I know somewhere
that's open so yeah oh I've got it done
and it was 20 pounds so I'll show it you
know so I
yeah I have the standard belly bar you
got like the two diamonds there and it
might look a bit stained like kind of a
red barnacle all the edge well that's
just because I went after the plaster
off that keeps it protected I realized
that it had bled quite a bit for some
reason and I don't think it's something
to get worried about but it bled and
yeah it's still a bit stained from that
so I talked to you about my experience
first of all quickly so I went in there
and I said to the guy hi can i my
Billabong pierced he was like yes sure
how old you so I told him my age and
then my mom signed for makes if you
under 16 then you will have to have
parental consent the minimum age in the
UK I think is 12 I think in the UK to
have your bellybutton pierced with
parental consent and then without it's
16 and it took us to a jewelry and like
holder so they were just like these
standard belly bars em and but you had
like different colors and so it means
research Halloween where I was put into
like the doctors type chair at this
journal
so I was put into that chair and he
wiped behind belly button with a
sterilized wipe now I hate people
touching my belly button it feels
disgusting so it just makes me cringe
and I know I'm not the only one out
there with that so if you can relate
then just call it blood but like I don't
like belly buttons either and then we
can become friends so they sat down and
got a clamp
so we've got the top in my belly button
like Thea top of that I can't really
talk chicks who told me not to and I got
it done today and and then he clamped it
like that between two sides and then the
triangle in the middle so you got a
triangle at the other end of the clamp
like that and then in the middle like
that bit there he marked it out with a
pen on the top and bottom and then I've
got the needle and he told me how I
would breathe so it's like try and focus
on your chest area to breathe like
breeds kind of in that way like that em
and he said don't use belly otherwise
it'll make it very difficult for me so I
was like okay so I Kobe then sadly then
are you expecting
it's like breathe in and out three times
we put the needle through but now you
won't breathe then happy and then the
needle went straight through now before
this I was quite scared about the pain
not realistic except quite high pain
tolerance of my ears when it comes to
port it kind of hurt not a lot nothing
to get worried about at all I don't be
like oh I want it done when I'm scaring
the pain it's not that bad depends like
oh my god I can't get it oh I'm too
scared and it's really not that bad it's
two minutes like three seconds right of
pain for like a lifetime of having
jewelry in your belly so yeah I was like
okay no matter but the pain the only
thing that I think is worse about it I
even feel like going through the top bit
party skin sliding through the skin in
the middle and then coming out the other
end the bottom bit I two out of ten the
pain was about four or six I can't
really decide when it was a four or six
so after that he gave me a plaster that
was this and yes yeah it is bloodstains
if you don't like anything like blood
then just look away now
but yet the what the plaster looks like
that that's that's how much I bled that
got on the plaster so it wasn't that bad
and then you just puts it over your
belly button like that and and you just
keep it on for a few hours to keep it
like protected for a bit and something
from moving on any material even as
we're in a crop top if you do need to
clean it when you first get an ox blood
use kettle water that you can use it hot
if you want or you can just wait for it
to cool down side the way it will kill
off the bacterium it'll be like really
clean water and I just got it and I put
it in a cup and then got a cotton bud
which is just in
yeah and then I cleaned it with and I
seemed to do the job and also if you
want to move that you need to clean it
with then definitely use Sun X which is
he
dermal Oh got a top-up dermo
hypoallergenic sanity I'm using my iPad
to film it so the quality is not very
good and I do apologize for that and I
do look tired very tired and what else
cuz I am so Lego
so yeah sanics diamond dome or
allergenic this is 3 pounds 19 and if
you are from the US if it has it in
Walmart or something
definitely go and get it the piercer
couldn't stress enough that like to get
this so I was like yep gets an X if you
wanted me to clean it with user so when
I was in the shower and yeah I just put
this on like normal it didn't hurt
whatsoever and there were hardly any
pain from it at all those of any pain
but the other thing is when they shower
like the water is quite powerful so it
like quite when it hit my Bell button it
hurts so it's like let it I like put it
on like item through my ribs and then
let it like kind of flow down so that's
really um yeah I just for the experience
I just do want to say also that with the
age thing if in case you wondering I'm
13 years old it's legal in the UK and if
you are going to hate if you're going to
hate them signal this but if you are
going to hate in the commenting world or
it's far too young to get it done it's
none of your business okay if I want to
get it done at this age this is exactly
what I've gone and done if you have a
problem with that then that's just
ruined apart your day it's not ruin mine
I'm still happy I'm not going to regret
it and so if you have a problem with it
then just keep it in your mind because
really it's none of your business at all
yeah the doors like two main things do
not worry about the pain when I don't go
get it done just completely ignore the
pain it cane doesn't matter at all and
clean it with sanics dermal
hypoallergenic it's got five hundred
milliliters in the one that I got and
and it's no colorant soap or what is it
parabens if you are going to use white
for that don't use fragrance wipes just
kind of avoid wipes altogether and use
this mainly or boiled clean water
what if you want to use
so that's in the video thank you guys so
much watching I really hope you enjoyed
it have a beautiful day and I will speak
to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
