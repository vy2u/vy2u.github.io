to get my braces with tips so I think in
it I'm kind of gonna get in a blue color
maybe you red color maybe purple I'm not
really sure it's probably the blue red
or purple but I'm actually really
excited for that and yeah it's for my
local dentist and I'll have them on for
a thing for about two and a half years
so I'll show you what I get in the kit
and I'll also do an individual video so
I knew what I'll guess it's my kit which
is on my channel right now so click down
and yeah after getting my braces fitted
so I have had my braces with it now so
here the our clothes and I've got a like
a blue color because it's kind of match
my eyes but there are different shades
and there was like I think there was
like a really new young green neon pink
dark pink blue lavender and there was a
few other ones but I like this color so
yeah I did tried to go for this color in
the end and if you want to see me go
over what I got in this package in more
detail um click on to my channel and all
of the information of what's in this bag
in more detail shop will be on there by
now so I'll go over it real quick for
this fluoride rinse gum health
toothbrush plaque search wax and
toothpaste thriller well i'll describe
to you more about it um in the video on
my channel there i think but yeah
basically the procedure that he took you
through was just you lie down on the bed
type thing chair and he sorry I had a
job done it really hurts
and they start you down and chair and he
put glue on et's he did more than this
but I'll just go for it really bigger so
put glue any teeth stuck the metal bars
in got the wire with the cooler got
scissors and twisted them around your
brace and then it were done but it took
an hour and if I'm this really big thing
in your mouth that made your mouth like
this
I'm oh really uncomfortable and all this
live there
we're building up in your mouth it
wasn't nice but it wasn't too bad
actually but it still did it was it was
uncomfortable but yeah these are braces
and to be honest my thoughts on them I'm
quite happy with them and when I first
saw him I was like oh crap these
wearable but as I got used to em yeah I
like him more and the reason reason as
to why I got her braces was cuz I've got
a jet by which means that I this parts
further forward then my bottom teeth it
you can't tell no one can tell it just
in case something happens with your jaw
when you rolled up and then also the
main reason was because of these two
teeth that's for the forward than that
one it's not even that much you're a
problem really but dentistry so I should
have braces for it so here they are
well happy with them just spat across
onto the camera great still can't talk
properly it didn't hurt at all
not one single bit of pain and it's my
birthday today if you want to see my
birthday tag then click on to my channel
cuz I got braces whilst I add um on my
birthday and it also had a jab and
absolutely bloody killers really I was
in there for about half an hour just
crying I'm massive of your if needles
it's not a book thing so yeah thank you

one more thing yeah I say in the
description below and this Saturday I am
going to be doing a live chat
in the UK of you can be from any way you
can be from America California Mexico
China Indonesia and not even anywhere

afternoon and for other places like that

just a matter I'll be doing a private
personal video telling you about the
live chat and if I can get any work and
having it looks a lot into it right now
but yeah so anyway in fact our basis I'm
happy with them so I I'm happy with them

took an hour didn't hurt it but it was
uncomfortable they don't hurt right now

of hours and yeah that's it for this
video so thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
