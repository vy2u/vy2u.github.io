forget to email me at makeup with Miller
25 gmail.com about anything the things I
do for you guys because I wanted a clear
background so I took this thing here
that is no way hooked on and I took it
off and I put it on the ground but
Stross always filming I then stood now
on my my blood you welcome got blood on
my bed and I've got blood on my floor
there so no way onto the actual video
now this is my brace journey so far
video thing so I'm going to start from
the beginning where I went to get my
braces and how I felt when they were
being fixed so I went to get my braces
and fitted and the dentist was four and
so I couldn't understand a word he was
saying
at all so I was like yeah I know what
you say when you're putting the braces
on what they do is the brackets the
metal square things and he glued someone
first to the center of your teeth you'll
have about 95% of your teeth with braces
on them although I have all my teeth
with braces on them and and that doesn't
know her at all getting braces fitted
but what he does after that is he has a
selection of bands and he asks you what
color you want and I wanted purple no
blue start off with so I got blue and
what he does is he gets like dental
scissors and get puts a band on them and
he wraps the band around the metal brace
I know you can feel this expression it's
really weird feeling really weird
feeling but it didn't really bother me
at all I have some I can tell seeks a
license terrible and but I have
they got blue-eyed purple I have purple
on right now
and and you're gonna get you cooler
changed every three months
nationally think that I've become
attached to my braces because I love
them and when I get them off I'll be
depressed because I love them and some
people see braces some people don't some
people just don't really make a
difference with them and and in everyone
in most people's cases who I've seen
they just look perfectly fine with them
and my friend Nicola Turner who has
braces right now she looks gorgeous with
them and I wish that I did all you're
not going to get Bali famine braces if
you do get bullied then the people that
are bullying you are just pathetic
because there is not a lot of the
world's population have braces so it's
not unusual so there's nothing that they
can criticize about it it's already
falling out of them and you don't like
them to stay and then that will normally
shut them up but I'm not too sure oh but
you do have quite a few options to
choose from
on how you will react to it but most of
time you're not going to get bully
people I'm going to say anything about
them because on most people as well
some people's cases great having braces
does look actually it just looks good so
don't worry about the bullying don't
worry about the pain and right now I
love my braces and dentist tells you not
to eat chewing gum but I don't eat
chewing gum I chew chewing gum so I
haven't eaten any chewing gums but I
have two chewing gum but it doesn't get
stuck to braces or anything like that
don't I can promise you it doesn't get
stuck to your braces at all Baba's guys
talked to Bruce about it and it's really
really easy and having braces is amazing
I'll have them on for another six months
or about a year now and under anyone and
then when you get them out off you'll be
really impressed with the results your
teeth will be perfect and if you're
worried about the district alignment of
them and you can get owned Whitestrips
beauties or you can get them right and
by then just professionally so Alice
video wasn't very detailed and but if
you do want a more detailed video then
just comment below and I will do one
like that if you enjoyed it email me at
makeup with Miller 24 at gmail.com if
you want to tell me
hello hi damn it my sister hello no they
are the telecommunication service people
that scan you and not good yeah
yeah it was one of them M international
things thank you are you gonna plug off
what do you mean put in I missed one
mwah oh yeah that's when I yeah nice tie
pleasing a lot worse after I would edit
that bit out but I just kept it in so
you didn't think I was lying or anything
like that because people do that but
obviously lie because unless he would be
perfect timing for him to randomly say
that and subscribe if you love me if you
don't love me then go away because I
don't love you either
so no falling over cuz my patterns so
good bye thank you so much watching and
