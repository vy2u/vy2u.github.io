actually are clicked on this channel
because you want to be able to get on
YouTube and do beauty videos but you are
not quite sure on where to start so if
that is the case then let's go straight
through the video okay so I hate long
intro so seriously I'm gonna just go
straight into the vision that number one
is to completely be yourself in your
videos now this goes for anyone if you
want to be a gamer starting out on
YouTube and beauty guru and so on that
uploads any video that they want then
just completely be yourself because I
see a lot of popular beauty gurus on
YouTube we're not gonna name any names
because that's just gonna start this
whole new thing so I'm not gonna say any
names but it's quite a few that I'll
just go that it just really serious in
that video so they they will say
gingerbread house okay okay a fake you
shall grab your syrup I know ginger
gingerbread my house and they're just
fairly serious in the videos and it
obviously I can't do it people are too
serious cuz I'll just watch the videos
and I'll just go low click it off
because I just I think almost have fun
in that I wanna I want something to make
me keep watching the video keep neutral
that's another step just keep neutral
don't go too overboard because I do that
but thing is um be myself but I think
being myself kind of scares people
so I'm going to stick to being neutral
and being is less weird as I can okay
now step four number two okay the person
you like I don't agree with this but a
lot of people seem to someone and just
chuck it in there Bob load your videos
on a regular basis um which I agree with
but also they say they need to upload
your videos on a regular basis on a
schedule time so some people will do
Monday take some things
right Dave so you should keep to them
but I don't so I just at law whenever
and it hasn't harmed me in any way and
that's step number three which i think
is a really really important one is to
get friends on YouTube get a huge
Network this collab channels such as
polish which is a new one
polishes we're quite a lot of high rated
beauty gurus they go on there and they
just collab videos do individual ones as
a theme each week I'm think I'm not too
sure on that so don't take my word for
it but I think there is but you just do
collapse or things like that it promotes
each other's channels you put them in
recommended channels in your in each
other's em future channel area and that
just really helps promote your channel
like you can also do swap switch and
you're just basically it's good to do an
international one because just a great
way to kind of gain friends and promote
your channel as well so yeah just
basically build a network get friends
that will promote your channel and that
you will get to know so you can do
collabs and then you your you're
basically sorta and listen table achieve
that you just have to get it send them a
quick message step number four
it's to look mister presentable in your
videos so don't just be there in the
sweat sweat pants and and it's sweater
like I know this is kind of a sweater
like a jumper but it's quite nice one
like this you can do it in the sweater
but just make sure you look at least a
bit presentable cuz I want to do I'll
decide I want to do a video so I'll
research it one night filled with the
next and then edit it the next day or
the next two days depends on how long it
takes to Eddie sometimes it takes more
than one night anything is a big job
but yeah just look presentable in your
videos because they also get more just
click on my videos cuz they go ah she's
ugly let's laugh with her no that's
actually what I do things and time to
just like people subscribe to take the
mick out of me that's not that makes
more sense
but if
yeah you do have a lot of like second
thoughts of things like that but just do
look presentable any videos and do
things go all out there and take time on
your videos step number five is to
always upgrade your equipment so for
example get it you can start off with
your phone that's completely fine cuz
iPhones have good quality cameras don't
get me wrong there there are cameras and
I'll be honest right but just make you
look great too
I'll come back and you will that will
make the whole girl keep I think is
still on books then you'll go
from others like me looking down the
side make sure you have a tripod - but
also giggle - and I'm kind of the tripod
here around can you matter and then just
are people one better quality videos cuz
if I wish to film it off my laptop right
now and it was all full saying you
couldn't hear me very well because um
like don't strangle for the microphone
ain't don't know if you could hear me
very well or not there but yeah you just
basically can tell what the same so you
don't know what's the point in watching
a video if you don't know what to say
yes number six is to have a nice
background now I actually have no way in
my house where I have a plain wall but
I've just sat on my bed got some pillows
and put them behind me like the same
style and so it's black and white and
just a plain purple background and that
works well for me but what I'm saying is
you can have any backgrounds make it
simple don't have a background where I
say you're in a garage and you've got
like a massive shelf full of like saying
games and weights and books and anything
like that and that's all dusty just make
sure it's nice and presentable so that
all the attention is focused on you and
not what's in the background like you
can stare for the whole entire
video of these patterns here but I think
it get a bit boring eventually so that
was number six and notes on to number
seven talk to your subscribers and get
to know them I see a lot of gurus on
YouTube that just really just don't talk
to subscribers for a while I tried to do
like live chats where I could answer
questions and things like that but as I
said before I'm not a very technological
person so that just went out the window
because then the technological software
thing gave me jiggy it's just it's not
fair I mean they're doing all this for
you then they they need people to
actually got you there so you've got to
be considerate towards them and talk to
them and be friends with them basically
and I just think that's a really really
big thing like if you've got like the
amount of subscribers that bethany mota
has like four million then yes you're
not going to reply to every single
comment that's on then I'm gonna in the
video logs me thank you so much for
watching this video as well and I hope
you have a brilliant day and keep
watching and I hope this helps it could
look any channel as well no spamming the
comments advertising your channel earth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
