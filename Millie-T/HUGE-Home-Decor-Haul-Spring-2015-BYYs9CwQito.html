what my foundation five shades to dark I
have to in fact got back from lunch
rotting where it is today and this one
gives you a tan so pigs Michael and I
have the red lipstick to match so really
take video is going to be a home decor
whole and whole all it's going to be a
really cheap box I went to be in am
which is like my freakin best place to
shop at home with a whole decoy it's
just so cheap and there's so much it up
there and I have it's a little bit if
you don't have one day you then don't
worry you can easily find it on like
eBay Amazon so this could be your
inspiration so I got two of these jars
right yeah they're like a rope jars
unveiled like this and they are so so
cute and they are like I've gotta turn
into such difficulty to go a literally a
living for the glass jars so yeah I have
two of these jobs actually and they I
have built them with candles tea lights
and nice because these tea lights will
go inside they you know the ices that I
bought which I'll show you later on but
it's like a rope one and if anyone has
like a beach-themed you that a thousand
about this is so much like beach themed
items that you can get then this
probably looks like a rockin mountain
well the anchor something like that I
said this I think you can write on it
like what's inside it like it was a solo
sugar part you could write salt and
sugar on the next one so I just got to a
piece and now I'm going to close with
some nail excuse me
okay something that I bought is a WoW I
like what I see here it's my candle
holder and then you could see my set up
by the wind is still my other house
opposite my dream catcher so yeah I can
just sit my candles on this and I just
think it's a really really nice - Matt
and I will show you the candles and I
bought to put in there and then
obviously I'll do an overlay the video
that you can see all the products so the
first thing when I bought to go on top
of the Admiral place map was that this
kind of pillar candle is just a really
simple pillar candle here it was 1099
and this was also welcome outside
tonight so this was might feel like I
know that I bought nothing much to say
about thighs just a vanilla but what I
just said - kinda like the color scheme
of chin and that just goes on the mirror
at the back side quite like a range of
size and candles the next candle I
thought was kinda like pillow woman
although it's got like a little quote on
it
I ate a fragrance with candle jar in
Jasmine and it looks like this and it
says time as a wonderful way of showing
us what really matters and the other one
was like all about woman relationships
are quite frankly out there along with
Netflix so I'd possibly like the
favorite kind of thing I got was this
footer it's like a footer and it's going
to look like whole he's holding a thing
make it you know what it's holding
something like you put it to your eye in
and then your idea and it looks really
nice alum everyone is love shade I mean
I've got a black one but I need it once
my dressing table so I could see what I
was doing when I put my makeup on
and it's just it's not one of those like
Elance kind of got like nine pound so a
lot cheaper and it's got like a
crystallized bottom here and like a
mirage or like a silver looking bottom
and then the top it's just a simple like
shade with like with like little folds
in the material and I just really like
this necessary and I was like you know
what I just want it so I got it quite
simply now if you like the paper thing
that I got I think that's everything
after that so thank you for watching up
to this mark and if you are still
watching go in any comment with the
capital X like a kiss after it just so I
know that you still watching and then I
will put a wink face and reply and
they'll just be like a secret because
we're just like in love and we're like
people and oh god I should probably not
even be just a dude watering it mine
that I have also bought candles I'll
also have to be trusted with fire anyway
I have bought this watermelon that was
five pounds and you turn it on
and it really swamped her and he has
pebbles in the bottom so it looks classy
and I don't know why I bought this but I
like it I dunno I ought to decide
simpler lighter and I'm happy with it
the next thing that I bought with these
two phone cages here so this is one and
this like a bird cage a new input a
Yankee Candle or whatever candle yuan
into DT a holder so I hoped for a Yankee
Candle in there and it's like a beach
smell like Alabama something like that
it's probably not that I can't remember
but it's just a really really cute cage
and I just leave it on my windowsill
here
thank you so much for watching and
seeing everything I bought today I'm
going to go and decorate my room fully
with all this stuff now so I hope that
you enjoyed it if you did enjoy this
video then I really don't care what if
you did thank you thank you so so much
for watching I love you so much and have
a beautiful day don't get stay positive
