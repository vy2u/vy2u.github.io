2013 giveaway
I know I've been saying that do one for
a while now but I haven't but that's
just because of various reasons so yeah
yeah so I'll just get a few points as
two points automate first number one
this is a start a beauty set video so if
your guy you probably want to click off
this video now it's mainly for girls but
if you're going you do want to do it
then fair enough keep doing it and enter
it but yeah probably maybe with the
girls and also number two I'll take the
date and this competition will be open
for one month and a bit so it'll start
so it's starts and the competition opens
October the 6th 2013 which is today for
me and it will finish on November the
15th 2013 next month so yeah it's open
for like a month in a bit and that in
months and 14 days um so yeah I'll
quickly move on to the rules now get
them out of the way because rules are
born so in this giveaway there are three
basic rules rule number one like this
video down below so you'll see a lite
version and rule number two subscribe to
my channel so you'll see the SUBSCRIBE
bother down below and also the final
rule is to comment which item in my
giveaway you would most like to win and
obviously you'll have to save until the
end when I've shown you them all but
yeah so let's get on to showing you my
giveaway items so first I will show you
the two lip glosses so here I have
Maybelline New York and Maybelline New
York color sensational lip gloss and
it's called hooked on pink here it is so
that's the first thing the second thing
is wet in the wild benefit and this
color is mint infusions lip tint
and SPF 15 so that's that there next I
have these aren't too great I just
thought they were really good don't they
when I first got there I didn't know
what they were because this wasn't the
picture when I bought them they are five
perfume samples there and the perfume
samples it is Avon only thing is I'm not
I can't remember what the perfume is
called
okay I'll come back I'll try and put it
in the description below but it's gonna
be a nice perfume so yeah in the five
perfumes here samples you've probably
get about ten wears you two probably get
about fifty wears off together maybe
turn on how much you put on and next
I'll just I'll be your my mule box and
everything but I need to show you
everything first and I won't damage yeah
so here I've still got the cover on it
as well and everything we've got premium
makeup here and when you open it up
you've got all these colors here for
eyeshadows and I chose the neutral
colors so I'll bring it closer so you
got kinda Browns and some colors are
quite neutral that'll kind of suit every
hair color you've got some Reds you got
some nice turquoise colors some pale
some darks and you got quite a bit there
now this cost a lot of money and I mean
a lot and then I saw a cheaper one after
I'd already bought this one but I'm sure
this one will be a lot better and so
it's a really good make apparently so
that's that put it over to one side and
next I've got number seven stay perfect
nail polish and that's that color there
also I have fun is really cool actually
nail files memory nail files so what you
do is like take the top off there there
the actual nail files there you got all
the separate ones so you've got
different colors and now I'm really good
and then also on the back so you've got
like the back of the head it's actually
really cool and so that's that some of
the things I've gotten here and friends
originally got me and then they have to
go out and buy some more because obvious
I'm not gonna give away what people got
me and so I had to go out and buy some
more
so I'm just worried like that Oh so I've
got number 7 little issues and this is
like a light pink color like that
another thing that I've got is Claire's
get what you want gift voucher I've got
two of these for my birthday one of one
of my friends and then another one of my
auntie and now I got I gave the one this
is one my auntie got me because she said
I'll tell her about the giveaway and she
said just give away my get Claire's get
what you want about her she was right
and I was that well don't know and she
was like no not at all you make all
these videos so she show so yeah she
just basically said I can use this so it
is and then that's five pounds that one
also I have some basic bath bombs here
rhubarb and custard and also I have a
delivery right here delivery box with
elf makeup eyes lips face so first of
all I'll show you this eye color again
I've got a 2001 button-up colors and
they are neutral colors like that
I've also got lessening and defining
mascara it's quite a thin tube that
actually but I like the kind of brush
because it's the kind of boy does that
make you eyelashes proper long and
really thick here you've got elf studio
minty lip gloss so there's a lip gloss
there and also finally from the elf
products you have an all-over cover
stick so it's just basically a light
that's what how to explain it you can
publish to you easier
looks like that and you could use it to
cover up spots you can use it to cover
up zips you and it also gets rid of them
as well and gradually over time or you
could use it as an all-over face powder
to just make your face look healthier so
that's all that there and I'd like to
say finally but it's not really finite
and I'll tell you two things I haven't
come yet
I've also got one strawberry us lip balm
if you don't know what that is it's like
an egg-shaped lip balm you if you search
it on google you'll see it it's really
good mate but they are super expensive
for what they are and but they are
really really good and also I've got a
huge 15 piece professional makeup brush
set but all both of them haven't come
yet and you really really need to get
this giveaway done with before I lose
any of the stuff but as soon as that
comes your you can't really mistake it's
just some basic bushes I really good I
really got an EOS strawberry lip balm
but yes this finally that I've got on
right now I've got Avon samples here so
there are loads of samples of lip
glosses so if you looking there so here
they are FJ make sure that we don't fall
out because that's what happens a lot so
this loads of samples in there so I read
out all of the colors
you know right so I've got them all
there they are actually tiny they're all
Avon and it but they are really small
I've got nine here um so here's this
first color here that's a coil of it and
this is a color
oh it says perfumed juice I don't know
what that means and also you've got this
color here and the color is just pink it
says this one here is called designer
red this one here is called high style
car coral this one here is called nude
perfection
this one here is called Rosie ribbons
this one here is called one-way plums
this one here is called lilac shimmer
and finally this one here is called
blush nude so I'll just put them back in
the back users are really easy to lose
but like if you have the kind of makeup
set way you've got different
compartments to put them in then these
will look really cute in there I just
thought they were really cute so I've
got quite I've got to sample things
which are the two sample things if I
can't see them anywhere
ah the perfumes and the Avon lipstick so
I live in the UK uh but this em giveaway
is open international so I don't care
away from you can still win this and I'm
not sure how much shipping car so it
doesn't cost a lot but it probably well

way and because it's clear out I've
spent here is well worth it for you guys
