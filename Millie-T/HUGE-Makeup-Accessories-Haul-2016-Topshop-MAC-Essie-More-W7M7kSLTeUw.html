how everyone is smiley and welcome to a
whole video my favorite videos to film
though this one is slightly random
there's a mix between nail varnish
makeup glasses concert tickets
choose hair pieces there's an assortment
there's an assortment I really hope that
you will enjoy this video if you do
please leave it a thumbs up and leave a
comment below telling me what your
favorite thing is from this video
because I'll be interested to know all
right the first thing that I got was
something that I mentioned in my
previous video I think it was two videos
ago now and it was my genius inventions
for girls that you need to know and in
it I talked about a product from Sigma
which was a brush cleansing mat so it
had a little worm bumped in it and you
run your brush over and it cleaned it
and then I was in super drug and I found
a Real Techniques version of one yeah I
was so happy so it's a brush cleansing
map with a different sized bumps on it
these small bumps are for smaller
brushes the medium ones are for of
average sized brushes and the bigger
ones are for big brushes and it also
comes with some brush cleansing gel to
use with it as well next I have been
growing up my nails for a while now I
had acrylic nails done when I got them
off my nails with proper long and I was
like I really want to keep them long so
I'm not going to buy them so to kind of
motivate myself not to buy them
I bought loads of nail polishes and nail
enhancing serums I guess so this one all
these two are both from Sally Hansen
this one is a parlous wraps nail
hardener which supposedly makes your
nails a lot harder I have used half the
bottle in around two weeks and it's a
terrible product
I'm just not overly happy with it I love
Sally Hansen normally but this one I'm
just I'm not feeling it to be honest it
didn't make my nails strong at all and
even when you use if every a little of
the product it leaves lots of air
bubbles trapped in your nail polish
which I'm not happy with this first one
is a very glittery one is not subtle
whatsoever and it's a glitter polish
pink in a cut above that's the name of
it I really really like this however it
takes around eight coats to get like a
fully glitter like
get glitter everywhere on your nail
maybe not eight maybe about four or five
so it's very time-consuming but it's
worth it because it looks absolutely
beautiful when it's done this next one
is called cabana boy it's a pearl one
it looks quite nude one up nude but
really subtle and bottle but when it's
on your nails it's really obvious which
I'm like it's really pigmented and I
will likely pail effect it has on my
fingernails and it's a listen addition
one so if you want it go and get it
quick I get cool tested at mark quite a
lot and even when I have a mean on
holiday or anything the colors that they
give me are always so different but they
both don't change my skin color a lot at
all like look at the color difference
for them one is NC 15
and this one's NC 25 NC 15 and C 25
they're both good for different things
this one is good for a more natural look
throughout the day but this one's good
if you go out at night I also got some
highlights because I barely had any
highlights and so I went out and got two
products I'm so sorry that everything is
high-end if you're looking for something
affordable it's just kind of turned out
that way
I resent the do it on purpose but this
is one is a nasty illuminator highlight
I was with Kirsty she really wanted a
NAS this NARS highlighted she'd seen I
used to Graham choose the basement once
to get it and she finally did and then I
got it with her and I really really
liked it do you use like half a
pea-sized amount on your finger then I
just do that and then I just dab it onto
my cheekbones and when it's in a cream
consistency like this I prefer to just
use my fingers because it just gives me
more accurate and location on wherever
it goes like I know exactly where I
wanted to go and I got another
highlighter called Urban Decay Naked
illuminated and this is a highlighting
powder that is absolutely gorgeous it's
so shimmery it's like what you'll see on
Instagram I hadn't heard
anything about this from anyone like I
haven't seen on social media no one was
making a buzz about it and I don't know
whether it was new or whatever but just
that urban decay win was for iris
packaging goals and next I got this NARS
creamy concealer because it lasted about
six months and then they ran out I was
devastated but never got another one but
when I was in Selfridges I just saw it
and I was like and I'm gonna get it I
need it it's in this shape in the law
which is ever so slightly lighter than
my natural skin tone which is great
because it works as a highlighter as
well - I got Rihanna concert tickets
there's two here I'm not going to show
you the front because I don't want to
anyone like forging it but yeah I got
two tickets to go and see Rihanna June
the 29th or Travie Cricket Ground I
cannot wait I'm so so excited next I got
a Polaroid Instax camera print frame
thingie holder photo album each pocket
is the perfect size for a picture the
principal pictures I don't know what you
call them
love polaroid pictures perfect sized
equipment and and then currently my
obsession with absolutely no regrets is
bandanas I love them so much so I have
two so far so I can keep them wrapped up
so it saves time I'm putting them on so
this is my favorite one cuz it feels
more and flexible it's got a more
flexible material in this I think that's
the word I'm looking for and when I put
it on I love them so much like this and
it's probably looks a bit weird because
obviously I don't really have a mirror
to do it I'm just kind of looking at my
viewfinder which is on computer below
but like I just love bananas so much and
then just if I'm having a bad hair day
I'm just like right bandana on and
that's that and I'm also started wearing
and
it's not backs for some reason I don't
know I go through phases in some
complexes for summer I'm going on
holiday tomorrow and or tomorrow morning
at half 6:00 in the morning which means
are going to be a bit like 4 o'clock
devastated these are the glasses here
and I really like the round glasses
style compared to the rectangular or
square so I put them on I don't really
like them I don't know they're a bit
different but bit John Lennon and
finally I got these shoes from misguided
for 11 pounds down from about 30 and
they are half suede half Fox leather and
they fit so well and they're just such
good quality and I love their heel it's
a lot different it's very original and
unique I guess because it's like a
triangular pointed heel that is
everything for today's video I really
hope you enjoyed this whole the kind of
a video I can just sit back and have
like a little chit chat kind of thing
please also leave a comment below I
absolutely love reading them I read
every single comment without fail
guaranteed have a beautiful day and
don't forget stay positive
