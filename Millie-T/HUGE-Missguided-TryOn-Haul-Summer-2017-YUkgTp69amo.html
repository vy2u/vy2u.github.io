going to be a misguided clothing haul
literally about 99% of my wardrobe is
misguided clothing I just really really
like the store - that's a long a missing
troll into the video clothing item one
but is this parish of the first call the
item that I got is these a pair of
shorts they are just your basic peach
pair of shorts but I did put the spell
on ourselves within come with the belt
there's not much to say about these so
the next clothing item in my whole term
that one I'm going to try and just cut
out your necessary so I'm just
going to literally sure called the item
and then move on because I feel like in
holes and I'm so guilty of this what
people show up clothing item and the
like so this shoe absolutely love this
shoes like really grey and it's like a
really nice white platform and you just
had only like yeah I'm watching a video
I can see so I'm going to just try and
cut it short so I got quite a few going
out clothes so if you're looking for
some going out outfits from misguided
then you've you're in the right place I
got this dress so what I like about this
dress is that it's very form-fitting but
also quite loose at the same time so for
example like a gold found to the skirt
area it like bags out quite a bit so it
makes you like you got wider hips from
you actually do and I really like the
look of that I've got a pile of clothes
on my bed and I'm just picking them up
in a random order so there's no
structure to this video okay this is
another dress although this is the place
you I absolutely love places because do
you want really classic but you can also
dance in them without having to I keep
pulling the dress down really annoying
so they're just so practical I don't
know what the color is it is a gray
color but it's not the grey that I like
it's a mixture between grain brown I
think what I do actually like about it
is again the chaps are adjustable so
it's just a little bit low or too high
here you can adjust that to like the
perfect fit and also it's got this hole
in the center so it shows like this bit
down to go from there to there and it's
just like a little peep hole and I just
I do really really liked that look this
one is just a skirt it's a lace-up style
skirt and but I haven't got one in this
collar it's like a Solomon cooler
that sounds really unattractive when you
see it like that doesn't
assumable for pink or nude it's like a
pinky nude color it really clinches the
waist because you can tie that as tight
as you want and that's very good
I wanted this from misguided for the
longest time but they were sold out
everything I ever wanted misguided is
always sold out or it looks like it's in
stock you press as the Baskin it's like
if I'm in stock and you like it you told
me that it was this was a very flowy
beachy place ooh and I really like it
it's still form-fitting because it's got
an elasticated waist but the arms are
extremely flowing it's got like a
layered arms that make sense I can you
see that layer then the second one
underneath you kind of wear it like that
and I really like like this area like
exposed because I feel like it's a
really nice feminine area right this is
so simple but I really like it if I can
write down in dress form so it's just
plain black so simple but so elegant
with like a lace top I'm adjustable
straps can you tell I like my adjustable
straps
my favorite Jess that I've got now I was
thinking okay la la you kind of go a
little bit over the top you know you go
about your comfort zone again and I
thought you know what I'm going to try
and find a really over-the-top dress and
boy did I sign that dress yet I
definitely found that it's a mini dress
it's a plain white mini dress but it's
got like a skeleton so it's very shaping
like it shapes you really well in it and
squeezes you in
so the main part of the dress is fine
that's just like a white mini dress but
it's the arms that make you look like an
angel
like in my case not really an angel I
want to be angel I guess so that's the
main front absolute a little bit and
then you've got the sleeves so our
actual wings this is my most favorite
dress but I'm going to have to pick and
choose when I wear it the thing that I
hate about going out to like an event if
you never know how people are going to
be dressing so if I think is to dress
your prevent and it's not a casual event
and I going wearing that it'd be a
little embarrassing I also got another
bikini top but this one isn't padded at
all and what do you call this it's got
the bumpy outline I got this a bralette
this probably is always sold out from
misguided and I show it my one which
like hmm okay it's some more to wear
under playsuit that's where the bralette
comes in handy this is another thing
that I'm not sure how I feel about so
the idea to get it to weld shorts and
stuff and it's like that it's like a
really classic sand dune FanDuel van
doos I'm so bad at a pronunciation
bangle bandeau extreme crop tops let's
go with that it's really thick and
really thrilled I wish you could feel it
like just try but it's a weird material
I've never experienced this material
before I also got these shorts that are
extremely floating really like freeing
but I can't figure out whether the high
waisted or not they naturally sit on my
hip but when they do that they are too
short at the back
well you look odd if I don't sit them on
my hips so it's a little bit I just have
to make sure that I keep pulling them
down now these I betrayed misguided for
I wanted some sweatpants for so long I
have sweatpants but the kind of like
travel to sweatpants silver not so they
are quite tight but I wanted to out
patent sort of complete just chilled
sweatpants so I got these Ivy Park ones
and they are my dream sweatpants they
are perfect so near you guys basics
about plants they've got a good park
down the side but what I absolutely love
about them is the way so I have massive
size but I have quite a small waist
which means that nothing ever fits me
properly which way after weapon by belts
make sure things are belted and stuff
just to kind of complement my figure I
guess because it's not that it really
just everything just looks bad but these
have a really big waist and like
everything the waist just massive but I
can just tie that and it just tightens
as far as you'd want it to go there's no
limit to it which is great so I can just
tie it so tight so I really like things
that feel tight around the waist
I just buy them for like nights in LA as
well in the apartments if you want to
excuse me that's not clothing
I bought a color something else I did
buy is a pair of black elasticated
shorts and they are I swear a necessity
and like every single
wardrobe because they are so practical
and go underneath anything you've got a
dress this a little bit too short put
the shorts on underneath and it becomes
a dress we've got like damage control
just in case the dress does Riedel
everything that I bought basically hope
you enjoyed watching this video as well
if you did leave a thumbs up on
thumbs-up button and I will see you in
my next video see you next time bye
