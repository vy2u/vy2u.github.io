days and start the summer holidays with
school for a school trip and let me tell
you I went to New York and it is
absolutely amazing from what I saw in
the pictures of New York I didn't expect
it to be as good as that cuz I thought
that like they edited the pictures for
Times Square and things like that but
when I actually went there it was
amazing exactly how I saw other pictures
along the way I did quite a lot shopping
and so I'm just gonna hold a few guys so
the first shop that I went to was Toys R
Us now I didn't get like a pony or
anything like that and I actually went
in there just kinda relieved my younger
childhood days and to kinda see what I
got and I bought an iPad because why not
so I got this iPad here it's um the iPad
Mini in black and this doesn't have
Retina display because it's the graphics
already sharp enough and I don't think
I'd want to pay an extra hundred dollars
to get something that it already has
that I in my opinion and and I did
originally want to get white but and
they didn't have a white 16 gigabyte
side to end up gettin a black one and in
my opinion I think I prefer a black one
um a black eye pad and also visual I got
an iPad was because it was cheaper in
America and I was planning on getting
one for a while as well and on my phone
I clogged it up with so much rubbish and
junk the iPad was $300 and then this
case which is like a red polka dot case
and then you can also like kind of flip
it and took it in there so it'll stand
up and that case was twelve dollars 33
from Walmart and if you live in America
or any country that has a Walmart you
are so so lucky the Walmart they're so
cheap and so amazing it's huge as well
and it here in England we have an Asda
and and all that Walmart is in
association with as during that Walmart
for Asda but Walmart's ten times better
so and I also went to the duty-free and
upon the duty-free I bought I spent a
hundred four dollars on a perfume I
cannot believe it
but this was a present for my mom
because I'm mr. a lark so I was after
nine days and me and my lot of quite a
strong relationship so if the nine days
that I was there I did miss her so I've
got a quite big present and so I've got
a big deal and is your law and then it's
a perfume in my opinion the packaging is
pretty ugly on this I don't like the
packaging but the smell is the best
smell I've ever smelled in my life it is
such a nice smell so yeah I'm not too
keen on the packaging it's not very nice
it's a bit weird looking but the smell
is absolutely gorgeous and it lasts all
day as well and the perfume itself was
like $96 and then obviously in America
there's a lot of things that have
everything has tax in them and I was
surprised as well that when you go out
for a meal and something to eat the bill
at the end of it you have to leave a tip
like that what is that their only source
of waged they make their money from the
tip of something because I don't know I
don't know I didn't really like the fact
that you had to leave the tip and it was
quite a lot as well and it was really
awkward starting out with tip between
you because it was far as eating it's
not so good it was so good so I'm going
to make up to the end but this not a lot
left for that until we've done some
makeup they're just going to show you
what I got from forever 21
I lost the bag so I just had to
substitute it with this and Spotify well
the first thing either I only got two
things from forever21 the first thing I
got with these shots here they are the
diagonal shots and they are really
scruffy ripped short so they are lower
down at the crotch and then they go up
and as they get to the kindest ID sign
and it's really are really nice I think
there were 40 something dollars which is
quite a lot for and I needed to spend my
money because all my money was already
in dollars I'm a mum one thought America
just because she didn't like the long
flight she hates long flights so I had
to spend it because if I didn't industry
 in there doing
I also got well the last thing I was
often from 21 where these shoes here
they look like this if I'm Yeti casual
wear
oops but they have three buckles here
and then it's it with a little stood on
it they fit so nicely and they are
slightly pointed at the toe as well and
I just think these for 40 something
dollars as well do it and I think I
spent about I think I spent $75 in
forever 21 so I'm a bit off with how
much they were but I do love these shoes
the other most powerful shoes that i
have i don't really wear trainers as
such I can wear dolly shoes heels and
boots and ankle boots things like that
because that is my style and that's just
why I love to wear so yeah these are the
most casual shoes that I own so next I
went to I sling which is the same as
Claire's but I don't really know why
I've called it something different but
when you go to the checkout they give
you a Claire's bag and if you don't look
glasses and it's like an accessory store
we get accessories and they have room
decor but from there I got three sets of
earrings because I have quite a few
piercings in my ears I'm not too many I
have a first step in my dog at my trial
got my first seconds my helix our first
seconds and my tragus so I got I go
through my earrings quite quickly and I
always end up losing them so I just got
three sets of earrings to wear these two
were $14 50 here and these are kind of
pastel colors and I really like these
and then these here are like vintage
type earrings you'll see them in a
smaller clip or you already have one and
these there's not a lot of earrings left
but the ones where this sort of missing
they're just black ones and I have them
in my ears right now apart from this one
where and I have a pink one in my Chagas
and they are just so gorgeous and I love
my earrings I need to get like a holder
display that you can also get from
Claire's very slightly different holes
music put them in and put the backs and
it just keeps him saying I got from
Claire's was this canvas and it's
Marilyn Monroe she's just perfection and
she's got a quote on here which is
amazing so she's got her kinda signature
pose where as I head back in life
just kind of Edward look on the face
which she pulls off amazingly quality we
should start to live before we get too
old fear is stupid
so I regrets and I just think that's
such an amazing quote to have and I love
the kind of pop of color it has so she's
like black and white and then you've got
like pink lips and then you've got like
the pink background for the highlight of
the words $8 50 which isn't too bad okay
so next I'm going to show you what I got
from Mac now I makes two shopping trips
to Mac and I didn't get as much it looks
like looks like I spent a fortune there
and which I didn't spend that much
actually so I've got four things from
Mac then just take them out now so I'm
at the airport on the way there the Mac
at the airport is always a watching for
because it's tax and duty-free and at
the airport so that was just amazing
so I got two bushes that ended up being
15 pounds each which I don't know how
much have it in dollars I got them in
Makkah and Melbourne so this is Makkah
here and this is Melbourne and I got a
foundation here Pro Longwear foundation
because a lot of youtubers have been
reading about this one I got in the skin
in the shade and c25 and and he looks
like this it's like it's kind of I taste
like a medium shade I also have a
question if you could please comment the
answer if you know so you can back to
market but if you back to Magda after
you and send back for you use product or
can you send back for packaging so could
I send back like five of these and then
they trade me a lipstick or just have to
be the actual product and then the final
thing I got from Mac was a lipstick in
full future and future and this is in
from the amplified collection and it's a
really bright vivid pink color oh I like
I don't know I've really wrinkly pumps I
don't know why so I'll just be aware of
that and
I went to see a psychic once like palm
reader and she read in my palm and as
soon as I showed my palm she was like
she was amazed at the much never seen
palms like that for an alive and she was
amazed then she taught me how to stick
sense she didn't tell me what for she
said I'll find it out in my lifetime but
I don't know the quite cool actually I'm
proud of them so there you got there you
go it's up I don't know it's like
infectious or anything obviously but I
don't know why they like that I'm
confused as well the doctors don't know
and then the final place I went to was
Sephora I I know needs support before
and it's amazing Sephora it's kind of
like a Selfridges in a way but it has
kind it's just focused purely on beauty
and the one that I went to was I went to
the shopping mall and in Washington
nothing and and then suppose I went in
there I've got two pallets and they were
$50 each the first one I got was a Too
Faced chocolate bar palette when I first
got it I opened it and I expected a huge
like really strong scent of chocolate to
come out it's made of cocoa powder like
partly not all of it and but it wasn't
that great at the first time but now
every time I open it like I'm like
attacked by this chocolate scent and
it's so so good I till the next palette
that I got was the Urban Decay electric
palette not so neutral and subtle
compared to the toothpaste one
I'll just so that's what the palette
looks like it's really good quality just
kind of plastic but it is really good
quality still I love the kind of look of
it it's like black and then it's got
like splurges of colors if you're
playing there paint balls and like that
and it's just really nice and then I
opened it and I was amazed at the gold I
already seen it on YouTube but I feel
that maybe the lighting made them look
brighter than they were they are so
bright
they are so so pigmented they are so
pigmented and it's great so this is
fringe savage slow burn and gonzo this
is chaos jilted urban and free and then
you've got yellow which is thrash so I
got the Anastasia brow powder duo in
soft brown so I told her that I like
bold brows but obviously it's a soft
spot and your eyebrows are supposed to
be like two to three shades darker than
your hair color so I've got this and
this is what it looks like it's got a
powder and then like the color of it and
and you kind of the dark one you more or
less use on its own the arch going down
with your brow and then sew the inner
brow you use the light one mixed with
the dark one but one light one and I
also got the anastasiya tinted brow gel
now I don't know how I feel about this
when she did it on me look really good
but then when I do it on myself to never
use brow gel before and it's which they
look alike always literally how you see
the color there it's like shimmery
blonde and I just like it's like pouring
your face another thing that I got my
eyebrows and what if I get any blemishes
or spots or anything on my face that
I've been covered up I got this NARS
radiant creamy concealer and it's in the
shade vanilla and she gave me this and
she said that I would use it on the arch
of my brow so I'll just underneath there
to kind of highlight it and it gives a
more sharp effect and I would try and
really keen on everything that I've
shown you everything I've shown you then
and it's generally about 20 something
dollars $24 something like that and
they're all round about the same price
next thing that I got is this Urban
Decay lush lush mascara it's quite thick
tube if I just got it out show you now
and it's purple because over the key
signature ball it's purple and and wash
prescribe Nelly first I'll do my
eyebrows recommended a mascara for me to
use and
said it was won by urban decay and this
best matched her description but I
couldn't really find the exact one and
the last thing that I got from former is
this Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion
and I needed a prime because I have some
now but quite cheap and they're not very
good I have the primer potion but in a
sample one and it worked absolutely
amazingly so I've got the agita primer
potion and it's a big tube it's a big
tube and on the camera they always look
smaller than the app this one is really
big
this cost $24 as well so I just have
tested out and I look how unique the
packaging is I think urban became
benefit is so good with a packaging like
they're all so unique and I just love
that but I ended up spending two hundred
and fifty dollars in Sephora altogether
anything that I showed you there from
Sephora cost two hundred and fifty
dollars so I did kinda spend up what I
did have to buy my own food and things
like that
I'm not going to apologize for what I
bought I'm not going to the disclaimer
and sit and apologize for everything
because through fair it's my money I
wanted to spend it on this so that's
what exactly what I did I'm not going to
apologize for that and I hate it when
people do apologize the only thing that
I'm going to do to disclaim it say that
I'm not bragging because I'm just I mean
I'm not going to brag on camera to
people that I haven't met I really hope
that you enjoyed this video I really
enjoyed filming it I'm sorry that I
haven't uploaded in a while I've been
super busy obviously been in America and
there's just a lot of stuff going on I
was filming for a while so that kind of
caught on with me you're still watching
leave any comment with you word and nice
and it nice I don't know for goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
