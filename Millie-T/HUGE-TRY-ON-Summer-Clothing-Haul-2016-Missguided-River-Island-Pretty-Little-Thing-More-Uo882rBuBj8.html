today's video which is going to be a
haul mainly from misguided a huge
percentages from misguided but a few
things very few are from pretty little
thing and River Island I am sorry about
blighting changes throughout this video
I'm using natural lighting and in
England it's a pretty sunny day with
clouds in the sky so the sun's kind of
going in and out onto the video first
thing I want to help you is a bag that I
purchase and it's this contrast and
shoulder bag from River Island so it's
white on one side and dark blue on the
other and it's absolutely gorgeous
it's and it holds so much and its really
comfortable on shoulders well right okay
the next thing I have is this black and
white skirt from Miss guided right ok
this was three pounds and I've never
ever seen clothing item so cheap in my
life so just like you know what I want
to get it it's pretty tumblr like it
kind of like a hipster design with the
like hand print and be like Illuminati
symbols on it
um and it's got like type of Jewish star
is it a Jewish star this is a pretty
simple fabric snake print skirt again
for misguided I just thought this to be
really good for and going out at night
on a holiday and to wear it with a
simple body suit like it like why make
us some a dress a burgundy color like
this this is the next thing it's a body
con burgundy high neck short sleeve
dress and I bought it for the summer but
the fashion pleats are going to be odd
to me because Burgundy's a winter color
what the thing is why make a summer
dress a winter color you can't wear that
in the winter at least you can't in
England anyway you get late pneumonia is
that what you get hypothermia something
like that something is some kind of
disease you get from being too
okay right so this one isn't something I
normally go for it's highlight tribal
print is what it reminds me off for some
reason
it's got an elasticated waist again but
I did buy it white no no I did buy a
white buckle belt to go with it as well
to kind of sculpt out my waist a little
bit more because play suits can drown
you if you don't like coming on the
waist and that's from pretty little
thing so this next thing is a dress from
misguided again and it's this like snake
print design and twist front dress like
booksellers it's got a wrap run and and
this is really good so you don't want to
go out eating and you get a little food
baby and and you realize that that crop
top you wearing wasn't a good idea
because now you look fat well that twist
front prevents that because it basically
makes her area pretty baggy and right
this is a nude suede place - it feels so
nice and like soft and suede it and it's
a button-up so depending on how long you
want it to come here you can like do the
bottoms up there and there but if you
want it quite well caught you can like
finish importance here so it's quite low
there and I do the bottoms up to here
it's really really comfortable actually
a really comfortable place suit and I
think that was about 30 pounds of fly
back okay so this is something that I
absolutely love this is from pretty
little thing now and it's this and black
play suit with white lacing detail on it
and it's pretty low cop at the front and
you can see here it's pretty low caught
the front bit here which I don't wanna
like local things with this I just
thought why not but it's got a really
less plated waist so it really sculpt
you figure a lot which I like okay boots
now thigh high boots so I actually wore
these to the Vienna concert and they
looked really good on pictures and stuff
however and they are not comfortable at
all you're gonna have to put some kind
of inserts in and if you want to wear
them for a long night and another thing
with these is that you know what they
obviously go to your thighs and you tie
them off here to make this titanium
they fall down right okay that is
everything
wait before you click off this video if
you are still watching up until this
point please leave this video a comment
let me know that you're still watching
it good just born my heart okay
that is everything now I'm done I've
been beautiful day and don't get to a
positive Wow bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
