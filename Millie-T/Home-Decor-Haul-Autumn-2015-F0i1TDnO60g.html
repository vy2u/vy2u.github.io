I'm looking
it's fern I'm spit on it hello everyone
its Mellie and welcome to today's video
which is going to be a home decor haul
now I originally went to be nem for some
curtains but I kind of got wrapped up in
all the decorations that they had there
and I came out with a lot more than I'd
bargained for so I hope you enjoy it so
I'm gonna start off with the curtains
just get those over and done with and
then we'll go on to the actual like
house decorations that I got or the room
decor so first thing I needed whoa
was a pole from our curtains not me and
you see the curtains I have now have
like tracks on them Alys turns and I got
aren't very good quality and I want my
room to look very like classy and
sophisticated so I wanted some metal
ring curtains cuz I think nail look
really classy it was only 20 pounds from
being em which actually is not a lot
compared to like other places a lot why
they were like 50 pounds something like
that so I got it for quite cheap
everything was from being em because
it's my favorite place however if you
don't have a beam em near where you live
like everything I've got here you will
be able to find somewhere else if you're
looking for inspiration this is a video
of you the pool that I've got here has
like a crystallized ball on the end that
I really like and I have grey walls and
I have cream curtains as well which I've
just bought now and I really think that
having like the black wall contrast with
the wire yeah I truly am sorry because
the curtains aren't very interesting
they were 30 pounds in Vienna these ones
so again they weren't too expensive but
they have the big metal hoops as I said
right yeah and it's also textured so you
can go for like a silk curtain but I
like these textured ones because it just
added texture it adds texture
now it's on to the actual home decor I
have a empty desk that's looking pretty
sad right now because it's just nothing
on it
valet and it's just it looks a bit
pathetic it looks really pathetic so I
needed something to spice it up a little
bit so I've got this essence candle set
and it's a pillar candle but like a
medium-sized one and then a little tea
light holder and then you put your own
tea light in and then some stones and
you had one that I said home sweet home
and then love laughs and the live I
think something like that and then it
has it comes with some pebbles I always
find that when I buy candles I never
actually use them like I don't like them
I just have the Neph if I ever need to
either which I probably won't but you
know what I will try and light these I'm
going to try my best and healer quickly
I got some puppets some meat queen
puppets because I love them and it's a
big box they're like one pound amazing
and also I got of course I've eaten them
some flips some white food covered
pretzels he's actually American I'm
pretty sure I had to be in my American
chocolate Hall please don't go watch it
again hugely embarrassing excited is to
acquit I was extremely happy satisfied
satisfaction and I couldn't oh the
candle hello I've got another candle set
as well things one has to put him on it
because I mean like Buddha and like and
not only really just sense I just really
like the home decoration options through
our Buddha because it just it looks so
chic and classy and I absolutely love
him her oh god this is hard to explain
Buddha right here absolutely love him
great guy great guy I don't if you'll be
able to see iron you can but it's very
blurry Buddha is in the background now
and my fingers pointing but it's a
really small like tea light ornament and
I I'm absolutely in love with it
my friend Kirsty again she was laughing
at me when I bought it because she
thought it was really weird
however I was very proud of the fact
that I bought a butter because i'll it
was something new for me it was
something adventurous and finally right
okay
you're watching until now just let me
know in the comments say I'm like oh if
I've compiled word here and if I haven't
said a word to say in the comments just
tell me that you were watching up until
this point because it's amazing and
congratulations because you now get to
see that the the best thing that I
bought I saw this on the website bnm
don't do home delivery so I was like so
excited I was like yes it is a mannequin
and it's vintage homes well so we kind
of go through these shabby-chic seem I
have in my room it's quite large but I
absolutely love it this is going to
replace second thoughts probably not on
the mannequin I knew Mars probably in
about 10 pieces on the floor values in
this today's video guys I hope that you
