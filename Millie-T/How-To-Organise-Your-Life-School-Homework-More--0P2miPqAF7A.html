uploaded in a while
my Mac has been kind of spazzing out a
little bit and my iMovie and Final Cut
Pro has not been working as well as it
should but I think I've got it working
again so we'll see anyway I have started
a second channel as well and the link
will be in the first three lines the
description you could go check it out
subscribe that would be amazing
onto the video organizing your life in
the past honestly I haven't been the
most organized person but recently I
have started to become a lot more
organized and I dried down a few of
things that make me organize now and I'm
going to share them with you so that you
can organize your life so the first
thing is when you organize it's mainly
going to be organized around your
bedroom like when you organize you can
organize in your bedroom write things
down etc so your wall once you work in a
tidy environment so if you are writing
something down with a pen after you're
finished using it put it back in the jar
and have a place for everything so make
sure everything has it at home because
sure we have that one draw in our room
where we're just like bits and bobs when
I was young ready to cut my bits and
bobs draw so basically we're something
that didn't go home went and it just
kind of built built up and then the
wrappers and stuff like that in there
okay the second thing I came up with
myself as I did most piece but this one
that I have now is not really used by
many people I don't think but basically
all you need is some post-it notes and a
pen and the more colorful they are the
better the most the my enjoyable they
are to use I guess what you need to do
is anything you need in for the next day
so for me if you my homework so if I had
some chemistry homework to be in a
variety down the girl chemistry homework
and I would stick it on my mirror attach
it to a piece of furniture that you will
use a lot like the head body bed
anything that you will notice in the
morning so you can remember number three
is an obvious swamp or it's quite
surprising on how many people actually
don't have one but its diary even a
calendar works as well but with a diary
all you need to do is any dates you have
planned with anyone write it down in
your diary and then at the start of
every week have a little
your diet so you can see any upcoming
events that may be taking place I also
use it for a YouTube video ideas things
like that and actually this is my planet
I use for my YouTube videos
number four is a timetable app don't
worry this video is not sponsored or
anything but a say timetable app
basically all the lessons I have
throughout the day I can schedule into
this app and it will tell me what
lessons next and it's so easy to work
and use and it doesn't take a very
technical person to get the hang of it
and also you can make all the lessons
colorful you can put what time's the
lessons are and it's just a really
really good app and it's completely free
this isn't a specific thing but it's
just something in general make
organizing queue or anything you used to
organize make it cute so for example the
post-it note idea and Sigma Timur don't
just use the yellow ones like makes a
little bit usually pink the green blue
ones and just put them all on your
mirror so they just look really really
nice and inviting and it'll just make it
a lot more fun to organize things in a
way paint your keys so the amount of
times my mom my dad my friends have said
to me okay I have these two keys but I
don't really know what 20 it is all they
have like 50 keys on one little loop
it's freezing cold it's like winter
outside you with them
and they have to go through about 50
keys to find the right one believe it or
not my voice like croak then believe it
or not your phone is actually a really
really good organizer and the main thing
that I used to organize myself on my
phone is who knows now know this is a
really obvious one everyone knows about
people don't really use it that often
and I think it's a really good thing to
use when you when you're making notes
because if your teenager or even past
teenage years or even before we all have
a phone and most of us carry a phone
around with us 24/7 every day so just to
have it with you if you put like a
reminder on your notes you'll have to
worry about like remembering the piece
of paper that you wrote down your notes
on it's just on your phone and also if
you see
your icloud you've got no chance of
losing it so you can always resume it no
matter what happens again this next one
it's other thing put to stop
procrastinating if you want to get
organized you just stop procrastinating
that sounded like a steam gym so TV
program if you want to tidy over you
don't go hop at it smile when you can
earn oh my god if you want to tidy your
room don't go I'll tidy it tomorrow then
because tonight I'm really busy watching
Netflix because you know there's a new
episode of Pretty Little Liars out so I
need to watch that or you know just go
straight into it go right I got the idea
of tagging my room I'm gonna do it now
also if you're really unmotivated
get the timer on your phone set it to 15
minutes and in that 15 minutes work like
crazy no breaks no stops or Walter no
stops for food just work like absolute
crazy and get everything doing as much
as you can away the time goes off if
you're really feeling motivated even
carry on but when this hand goes up
ultimately just stop what you're doing
go back to Netflix and pizza that was my
Valentines this year also with the stop
procrastinate do want and get rid
instructions iPads iPhones iPods just
get rid of them although none of us
really use iPods anymore and the last
one is once you complete a task for
example homework and take it up to your
list and reward yourself more you can do
this one if you want to be more
inventive and creative put down
different rewards for one piece of paper
put them in a hat and pick one out
ranging from like chocolate but even
might go on a spa day on Saturday just
reward yourself in that way and it's
just a really really great way to get
yourself motivates to do all these
things I hope you enjoyed this video
that is the end I am obviously not the
most organized person blank so up

they did help you please leave a comment
