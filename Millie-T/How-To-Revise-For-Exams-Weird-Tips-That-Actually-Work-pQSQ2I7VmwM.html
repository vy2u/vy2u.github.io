hello everyone it's really I'm when it
comes to school and you feel like our
parents don't understand how stressful
it can be sometimes not only with
friends but with exams as well because I
have exams every year in school at the
end of every year like big exams and
other than that we have exams I would
say on average once a week possibly
depending on each subject because we
have an end of topic subject test as
well and we have fake GCSEs kinda like
mock GCSEs in around four weeks and I'm
on holiday for two of those weeks which
means I have two weeks to revise for
about 11 subjects so I'm going to talk
you through the techniques that I use
and hopefully they'll help you to and if
they do help you please give this video
a thumbs up to let me know that it helps
and also to help others find videos the
first one I have for you is one of my
favorites and it's to act like you are
teaching what you have learned so in
every subject is split up into topics so
for example I am obsessed with space
absolutely obsessed with the universe I
revised that out of my own world I found
out from video on ASAP science that a
test was carried out where half of the
participants were made to believe that
they were learning it and then the other
half made to believe that they were
teaching it and those that believed they
were teaching it got A's and those that
believed they were learning it just
learning it and not teaching it got B's
and C's which is like a lot lower
obviously so I thought that was really
interesting definitely give that one a
go if you want the information to go in
100% right
oh no Millie uncle no mom it's fine it's
a can a cadet here funny enough to know
right I've got a mom here with me now
because she's a teacher so she knows and
most about revising probably Germany
tips maybe I'm advising
what to do
just keep at it Safran a horrible advice
I know
just think of what just a one piece of
advice about your vision that is useful
you can't think of time if you want
thinking chance services the first is to
get plenty of sleep and then when you
are revising you are fresh so advise in
the morning or not necessarily just make
sure that you're not over Toyota any
time falling asleep that means early
night is ready techniques it's going to
techniques at you he's there any
techniques you recommend person are like
I just said flashcards probably the best
flashcards are good what what do kids
normally find the best way to revisers
flashcards repetition just by going over
it again and again instead of just
making notes I'm forgetting about them
we highlight what you know that you know
so you don't have to do it again oh yeah
I really learn what you know because you
already know it new way to intervene for
suspending or something else that's good
advice
what flashcards are the main piece of
advice I have you okay thanks mom
looking and also just experiment on
different ways to learn that work for
you so maybe try revising put in
everything you learn in the PowerPoint
and or a word document writing an essay
on it whatever might work for you
experiment dubois recordings and listen
to it put it in a song there are so many
different revision techniques I'll read
through all my notes and then I'll put
the notes into questions on an app
called and flashcards I'll ask myself a
question on a so for example what is the
kinetic theory and then I'll put the
answer I'm really come to revise it I
can I'll see the question I can tap it
the card will flip over and I'll have
the question on one side and the answer
on another so I can look at the question
answer it and then flip it over to see
if I got it right my next piece of
advice is
definitely do and this is to use past
papers or past questions found online if
you are doing GCSE DS which is mainly in
the UK I think then you can use the
website AQA you can find basically every
past paper every subject that they've
done in the past seven years or so if
you're in America I'm sure there are
websites that will give you past papers
of SATs you might have coming up and
these are a really really good way to
familiarize yourself with what the
questions might ask and how they are
asking to research how the questions are
asked for example if a question might
say suggest how this is effective then
it doesn't mean use your knowledge in
what you have revised it usually means
that the answer somewhere in the
question and you just need to use common
sense to find it again if there is a to
mark question that means two points and
if it's an eight mark question it
probably requires an introduction to get
up to the higher levels if you want to
guarantee that you won't fail use a mark
specification so this here is my biology
unit one that I've had to learn and it's
pretty big like you probably won't be
able to see it very very well but all of
these are like little things that I have
to learn and there are pages and pages
and pages this booklet alone is unit one
and we have about three units we've got
to get through so it's a lot of work for
a mark specification if you follow that
and research everything online is a
certain way of making sure that you
won't fail this next one is more of the
unconventional ones and I find it helps
so so much so if you haven't got exams
coming up quite yet and you still have
lesson time in school use the middle
page in your book to jot down the main
things you need to know for that subject
that might not make sense but it will in
a second for example in Spanish you main
thing you need to know off vocab and
good phrases to use so I might pop in
the middle page me go study yeah and
that would be I would like to and just
little phrases like that and obviously
Bowl cups or anything that might be
helped
for example LA Manzana and then a poor
Apple so the translation to English in
history you would use the mill page to
put down dates that is everything for
today's video I hope that you do amazing
in your exam so that your vision goes
very smoothly which it probably won't
because your vision I just always get
sidetracked I'm a beautiful day don't
forget stay positive and I really really
hope that you enjoyed this video and you
will stick around by subscribing no bye
