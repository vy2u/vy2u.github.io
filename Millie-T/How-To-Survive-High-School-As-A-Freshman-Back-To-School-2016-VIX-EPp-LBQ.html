today's video is going to be tips and
advice for high school with you start as
a freshman or in the UK you're starting
in year 7 or even just one advice for
school as a whole if you in the middle
of high school then you're on the right
video I'm going to try and give you as
many personal tips as possible that if I
was told back in time I would have maybe
done differently or do now since it's
back to school themed prior to this
video I like email from amino apps
asking me if I wanted to collaborate
with them in a video and and then
sponsor me and I took a look at that app
that they were kind of promoting it's
very friendly there's a lot to it it's
free as well so I thought why not
so the app that I'm talking about is
school amino amino apps have so many
different apps but the specific one is
going to be AB school amino and when you
go on to it there are so so many
different features the main newsfeed
that you can scroll down and take a look
at you can like them you can comment you
can M get a study help on it the Civic
feature to get study help where you
might ask people for help and they
couldn't help you with your homework and
there's also a chat community so you go
down the so many different categories of
like chat rooms so there might be people
in seventh grade people go into 10th
grade and relationship advice also my
name ona is at milites or follow me on
there and I'll pull you back and I'll be
posting a little bit more on it and when
I can I'm really bad at keeping active
available I will try my best for certain
one is just to okay
this is so typical but just trust me tip
number one is to be yourself because if
you're going to school being if you go
into high school being someone
completely different to yourself and
being like right I'm going to be this
person someone says this to me I'm going
to reply with that if you do that you're
basically giving yourself an acting role
but this acting or you don't just have
to keep up for a few days lots of
filming or maybe a month plus a film
you've got to keep it up for four years
you become friends with people that
don't really gel with you because
obviously they are getting to know I'm
getting to like someone that has a
different personality to what you
actually have but if you be yourself you
will make friends with people that you
genuinely gel with them bond with and
have the same personality with and
that's how you'll make and
long friends for you just be yourself
and make friends with the right people
number two still on table good friends
don't get so caught up with arguments
with friends and stuff
I've lost have got a few friends in high
school and at the time I was so
devastated and I was absolutely
mortified that they've done something
and we argued and stuff like that really
when L got a bigger picture I fell out
with some friends but made friends with
and as a result made friends my current
best friend she's like the most out of
person ever I could trust her with
anything and we've never we've like
never argued I've been friends for a few
years now we've never argued once and so
people might see that as a bad thing but
we just don't have those personalities
together to argue there's just no reason
why we would everything happens for a
reason I'll be honest it'll be that
everything happens for a reason good or
bad it really does and everything bad
that's happened in my life something
better has to come out of it no matter
how far change of events after that bad
incident you have to look something
better will of malakut somewhere them
and everything does happen for a reason
if you believe that you have a different
outlook on things I really do believe
that though and you should do it changes
your outlook from the first year you go
into high school keep your books all of
your books whether you finish them keep
them put it in a box because when it
comes to your GCSEs or in America SATs
or something like that you will need
them to go back and look at because the
mark specification for your GCSEs so we
might be like you've got to be such
photosynthesis because that might be on
10 tests random photosynthesis in the
first year of high school or not like
really in detail but not doing it as
much in detail since and you will need
that book to go back and research on
them before stand up yourself okay I'm
going to be completely honest with this
I am absolutely sick of hearing just
walk away so much better than that just
walk away and be the bigger person if
some cases walking away and being the
bigger person is for the best and add a
comment think of an example but there
will be some cases where walking away is
the best thing to do and like you're
starting to get aggressive and stuff and
you don't know how to fight
walk away and
if a girl is I'm going to go you I'm
being like your this tool that your that
how dare you do this and then put there
the one in the wrong and you have
something to say speak up and say it
prove your point because you if you
don't say anything just stand there
thing sit there thinking you're the
bigger person you don't know why the
bigger person you need to speak up and
stand up for yourself
if someone's open with you and you just
kind of sat there and so one wants to
look like can it let all the top down
and away and pick an argument there's no
big an element with you because you
don't say anything
so I'll just stand up yourself tip
number five is be confident and I know
some of these are so typical but I
believe in these you need to be
confident don't fake confidence because
that's really obvious just work on
wastegate self more confident whether
it's joining an acting school being
confident allows you to meet new people
meeting new people allows you to up to
events and parties that your friends
might have an invited to which will
allow you to have a better experience in
high schools together highlight us
highlight important parts of you were
like when you start a new topic in your
book and make like a triangle with your
page and I market with your page whether
it's put in a post-it note that is sure
that it's a new topic or whatever just
if you organize your books it makes it
so much easier to look back on and
organize through and with GCSEs and that
are new SATs that's tip number six pick
you number seven this is a bit of a
weird one but it's with friendship moves
as well and don't be a friendship group
with like ten people and be friends with
them equally and because at some point
while you're being friends with everyone
in this friendship with this massive
friendship group equally they'll be
getting closer and closer to other
people in the group and slightly might
before people that becoming really close
in the group might be five people that
coming really close in the group and if
you stay equally friends with all of
them you're gonna end up being left out
because this high school goes on that
group you're gonna deteriorate and split
it is and it'll be a miracle if it
doesn't and picking you'd wanna be
friends with you you think it'd be the
best influence and you have the best
time with who makes you laugh the most
maybe and just stick with them and just
kind become closer with them so when it
does to tell you right you're going to
help them and it's a difficult even
closer to I have
beautiful friendship from then on and
anything to number eight is to get
involved with extracurricular activities
as much as possible and even if you kind
of a lot of things even I'm guilty of
this slide you there might be like
basketballs on after school I kind of
want to do that in a be like cursory
view basketballs never actually dot this
recursive written for the brand blah
blah person John do basketballs might
like and they'll not really a black okay
yeah I'm not doing it by myself and what
seriously do extracurricular activities
with some of the things that you enjoy
like basketball netball okay anything
like that
it's how you make friends for one and if
you describe you something you are
extremely passionate about it might be a
future career if you are really good at
it you might you never know you might be
amazing at it and never knew tip number
nine make the most out of high school
okay so I'm one of you where I hit high
school it's so terrible when you ask
anyone um kind of middle aged people and
like what's that your best memory in
life a lot of no probably say well when
I was in high school I had these friends
and went this place in that place and oh
we were in high school here in the
hallway and a lot of memory stem from
high school just make the most out of it
you might hate high school if you do I
feel you I used to hate it so much but
now I'm I'm so happy with the friends
that I've got in high school and I'm
happy with how I'm doing in terms of
grades and things like that and just
kind of make the most out of it as best
as you can even if it's a terrible
situation look at the bright side and
just try just anything that come in
situational a little bit better do it
and you'll have a better time in high
school the last tip is don't get too
wrapped up in getting good grades good
grades are important that's the sole
purpose of going to school there's more
to it than that if friends want you to
go out with them and be like hey you
wanna hang out tour today you don't I'm
gonna get so much backlash for this
mm-hmm don't say I just wanna say anyway
it's what I believe okay don't say no
I'm not going out tonight so I've got to
do homework that I've got to do if you
really want to go if you don't want to
go and you want to use homework as an
excuse
go ahead I feel yeah um but if you have
homework to do and you like hey we're
going out to eat tonight you wanna come
you like
I can't I've got to do homework stop it
go out to eat you know if you that
mother died almost if until like 2
o'clock in the morning doing it don't
miss out on experience in life as like a
teenager to do homework that's not
really important as a whole because a
lot homework doesn't really help you and
focus on growing more as a person then
getting good grades depending and so
yeah don't miss out on a good
opportunities because you have to do
homework ok that is it for today's video
