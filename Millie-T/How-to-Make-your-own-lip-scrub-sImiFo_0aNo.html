own lip scrub I made one earlier so the
work cups very sugary to get rid of that
here is the one I made earlier I'll show
you what it should look like at the end
the ingredients that you will need
ah-so olive oil I've got a very large
tin but any size will do some sugar can
use any type of sugar
this one's granulated but you can use
brown sugar or whatever you want I've
got some syrup that will be to add scent
and make the texture of your mixture but
if you don't have any syrup then you can
use honey or anything like that
also you've obviously going to need
something to hold the mixture in and the
lips come in so I've got these cute
little separate wares and they should be
empty inside and back
and you'll need a mixing bowl add some
spoons so what you'll need to do is
first you'll get your olive oil and you
will need one and a half spoonfuls of
that
and the olive oil will be used to
moisturize your lips and next you'll
need soap sugar you'll need quite a lot
of sugar so I'd say about two spoonfuls
quite big and sugar should almost
straightaway dissolve into the olive oil
like that next you'll just need to mix
it all
the waxing it the mixture will probably
go all lumpy and all separate but that's
normal because it will all blend in
together it's no more when you put it in
the square so that's what mine looks
like so the last thing that you'll need
is your syrup or honey
whichever one you're using and you'll
need about one spoonful or half spoonful
depending on how big your Tupperware is
and you'll just put that mixture
if you want if you want to speed it all
off then just get in screening squared
off I'm going to add a bit more money
because I'm going to don't think I used
and you mix it all together your mixer
should more or less stay the same part
for I'll probably change color from
maybe greeny colour to an orange a
yellow color if you're not happy with
your mixture so far because if you look
at mine it looks quite nice and what you
want is it to be quite hard so I'm going
to add a bit more sugar so they'll scrub
my lips more so my looks
if you'll get on a spoon mine looks like
that and what you're going to need to do
and there is I do add the mixture into
your Tupperware so it's when I get that
put it in
I'm going to squash it in so I can fit
more in and get more and squash it in
Maur and squash it in the thing you'll
need is a lip brush and you can use that
to mix it all in once it's in super wear
and also you'll use this to apply it
onto your lips so you'll get it and you
should be able to see quite a lot of
sugar in there and put it on your lips
your lips should feel quite sugary when
it's on but what you do is you will be
lips together because that will remove
all the dead skin from them
don't worry if you swallow any because
everything you've used is edible the
olive oil is sugar I'm sorry for honey
so you're licking all that off once
we'll be there and keep doing this say
five times a day maybe well three times
a day your lips should feel a lot
smoother in no time that's watching
please remember to subscribe comment or
like if you've got any requests and
please message me and I'll try my best
to include them in another video thanks
for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
