one just an updated version okay so real
stretch the warm-ups you'll need to do
this place if you don't already know
splits and you're going to kinda
struggle on your heel stretch so I would
really advise you to last it is splits
if you don't already nice to do the
splits and check out my channel and I
have a video on the splits for that so
that would help Oh
so the basic splits okay I'm gonna tell
you right now but they probably didn't
want to know what heavy favor doing in
this place
I'm gonna try and get your leg to come
back grab it I can't do that anyway so
against the splits and that's probably
number one who are more then do like
that warm up keep doing that and hold it
for longer and and one of us and ankles
that's the major one reason ankles and
then if you've warmed up them and you
don't like basic warm before that it
should be alright so now I'm gonna teach
you the technique for getting up to
expect okay
so this is a heel stretch and a why
balance so it's not much different
between them except the white balance is
to the side and the heel stretch is in
front and the kind of the same so you
ever grab them differently so the way
you're gonna grab em yourself okay that
sounded really bad the way you're gonna
grab your foot is that you're going to
so can get up to a Liberty and then
you're gonna like kind of hook your arm
underneath like that so hook your arm
underneath and grab the side you four
the outside side if you thought so like
handed under grab that bit like that and
then you said you're going out to the
side like that grab you there
you're gonna kinda grabbing it to the
front so it goes here instead of right
here so and then you grab it and you
straighten your leg well that's not
really that hard and grab it up okay and
then I go and straighten I but I'm not I
didn't do it properly that time but look
just a key factor little how far is
keeping this knee completely straight um
and just everything straight and keeping
itself tight which is squeezing
everything like kind of what I what we
were saying to me it is when you like
tightening for say like cheerleading
stunts or gymnastics and imagine that
you've got a 5p pence in your bum well
any bum peeks and you got to hold it
there you can't let it fall so they're
like are you gonna squeeze all over like
that and then keep squeezing bring it up
and that should help a lot and for their
and what's it called heel stretch it
doesn't really matter if you start right
here it can be a bit to the side your
summers as long as you're going up like
that and it doesn't end up being like
that also what a lot of people do is to
do a kick up one which is where they
kick it up and rub it just spent my
finger back okay where to kick it up
grab it and then keep it there so that
one's a lot more difficult and it's sad
and it sounds a lot easier than it
actually is
so this is like the normal one and oh
yes you want to catch something right to
hold on to to support yourself but I've
got nothing so keep your leg straight
Rick can bend a bit the stylist not
unless we're in a competition then it
can't bend that's all so bring it up
away I should
it's alright grab it bring it up and
then so that's normal one and kind of
spring man mother aunts been my uncle it
just quite sore and this is another one
where you just step keep it up grab it
blink blow it pop for that time step
kick it up grab it like that so there
are two types if you want more detailed
one video on the normal way it will kick
up then just leave a comment or send me
a private message and I'll probably
reply within the next day because I
check my message it's quite a lot
because I get quite a lot requests but
some of them I have no idea what they
are and then are you apply saying I
don't know what the art can you explain
why and they don't reply no I've got
enough so oh yeah if you know what the
cow pose is and I know it's something
like the cow pose then please comment
below and tell me because I have no clue
what it is I type it in on YouTube cow
pose and no video comes up and I get
about ten requests a day for that and I
don't know what it is so thanks for
watching please subscribe comment and
