up close and personal it's just that
this video is an eye tutorial so I'm
gonna have to be pretty close if you
have clicked on this video looking for a
natural eye makeup tutorial you've come
to the wrong place we are going to have
very thick very heavy very long lashes
by the end of it and it's a very very
drastic eye makeup thing but I do hope
you enjoy anyway the first thing you
will need is an eyelash separating brush
or if you don't have one of those you
can use a pair of tweezers or a pin I
decided to use the brush and I am doing
is placing the brush underneath my
lashes unblinking onto it and this I
find is the most effective way to
separate your lashes once you have done
this you can move on to applying your
mascara and use a nice thick brush if
you want to achieve long thick lashes
make sure to target your outer and inner
lashes too cuz they are important and if
you get some SCARA in the corner of your
eye like I did just use a cotton bud or
a q-tip to get rid of that also a quick
tip for lengthening your lashes when
putting on mascara is to blink down onto
the brush like I am doing here it makes
your lashes a hell of a lot longer for
added volume to my lashes I use an old
boots membership card and I pulled my
lashes onto that card and it just adds
length volume and it's just it's a
really really good tip I would highly
highly recommend using it and to make
your lashes even more thick use a q-tip
and some Johnson's baby powder I applied
that to both sides of your lashes and
when you apply your next Corvis Kara its
thickens your lashes like matter
and a piece of advice is instead of
pumping they wandered into the tube when
you get in with more mascara roll it
around as pumping de wand into the tube
actually fills it with air and it dries
out your mascara very quickly after I
have put on the talcum powder / baby
powder you can actually see how much
more thick and volume is my lash to
become after putting the mascara on
and after that I went back in with the
eyelash separated to make sure that my
eyelashes didn't come together too much
to enhance my eyelashes so more I went
in with the volume million lashes
mascara by L'Oreal as this is great for
lengthening the lashes and also the wand
is really good at the end to just get
the very inner and outer corners of my
eyelashes also I feel like each mascara
has its own individual strong point so
if I use a range of like three mascara I
think that it all just helped me to
achieve the perfect lashes which is why
I then went in with the Urban Decay big
fattie mascara
so the covergirl bombshell mascara
actually has two ends to it the number
one has a really thick brush that I used
in the beginning and a number two has a
really thin brush that is great for your
bottom lashes and when applying this
mascara I made sure to get to the very
outer corners and the very inner corners
of my eyelashes so that I could achieve
a very full effect
after this I went in with the eyelash
separating comb again but then one of my
eyelashes came out and it was stuck in
there and if this does happen to you
just get a pair of tweezers and just
pull that baby out
if you feel that you can't achieve this
effects you have really short eyelashes
apply Vaseline to your eyelashes every
night before you go to bed and they
should grow in no time okay guys so that
is the end of today's video I really
hope you enjoyed this video and Dillon
or my pax that came along with it and I
just realized that I haven't taken all
my mascara off this I hear so there
isn't that much of a comparison between
the two or although I would have think
about it there is a clear difference
between which one has mascara on and
which one doesn't again this isn't a
natural look it it's a spider and a
clumpy last year but I love it like that
have a beautiful day and don't get stay
positive laughs bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
