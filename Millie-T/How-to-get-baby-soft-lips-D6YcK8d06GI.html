stuff luscious lips in five minutes
things you'll need so you might have to
pause this video what's going get these
items and firstly choose bush electric
or manual doesn't matter as long as it's
got to be pushing on it second thing
you'll need sugar is it matter what type
is unfit sugar and any simple passive
water just got so can't really go wrong
with water and and finally you'll need
some well one of your favorite or lip
balm don't matter which one to see
favorite I'm first going to start with
toothbrush because this is like the main
thing that gets rid of the dead skin on
your lips if you haven't electric
toothbrush then you might want to turn
that on but it normally works better if
you just leave it oh it is so if you've
got a little manual toothbrush then
that's perfect and you're going to rub
it all over your lips just is if you're
brushing your teeth for about I say
about one minute so I'll get going with
that next you're going to get your sugar
and your glass of water because these
will be used together and we're gonna do
is the cake sugar and you're gonna pull
kind of as much as you think that it'll
need into the glass water so if you're
satisfied oh no I really this way I'm
gonna get put your finger in it and
you're gonna go X button because
obviously the watch will s omething
bottom and you'll have a decent amount
of sugar on your food from that as you
can see and you are my taste please
sugar when I would for use to get
potential birth and eat it just out my
finger the most hygienic thing when I
did it
you're gonna stupid so yeah okay listen
just rub it along your lips and you will
it won't hurt anything like that that's
all and it might scratch a bit but
nothing to cause pain so score along
your whole your lips not very precise
let's get on this again nothing will
happen and you will still have some
sugar left on your finger that you can't
get off so just sit your finger if you
don't want to do that simply get some
paper and wiped off and if you look your
lips together now you should be able to
like feel the difference if you need to
all this routine then I would suggest
doing this every night it'll last you to
have the whole day then after the first
1 2 weeks you will be able to move on to
say doing it once every 2 nights and
then after that 2 weeks once every 3
nights and so on but just be sure to if
your lips feel dry then be sure to do it
don't just think oh I can do it tomorrow
because it's all about what you feel
comfortable with so if you feel like you
still have to do it every day then do it
every day
because doing this will definitely leave
you with baby soft lips</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
