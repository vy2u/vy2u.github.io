while I've just been a waste to be some
holiday and it was amazing but I'm back
now and uploading videos and this video
is how to get beachy waves so the first
thing I'm going to need is a bubble and
next you're going to have to make a
decision so depending on how much hair
you have
you can either part it on the back and
put it to sides or weave it over to one
side to make a bit Condor on one side
I'm gonna put on my hand to one side
because in the middle of being thin and
thick so I'm just gonna move it off of
one side sees a lot easier and what
you're going to do is going to get your
hair and you're going to plot it so get
your hair and plot it so I'm going to do
that right now
voila voila voila
no go so I got iron to a plat and even
Giusti use tight or loose curls I've
chosen tight curls because they give
more tight beachy waves
let's not really loose once so want to
put your hair into a plot like this
we're going to do is you're going to
grab your straightness I've got an issue
Clark's right yes you can use your GHD
so whatever straightness of guy it
doesn't really matter because I'll
straighten his straighten hair it's a
fact okay so you got your straightness
and what you're gonna do is you're gonna
wait a bit from to warm up I don't do is
straighten you Platt now just so I get a
definite result I'm going to straighten
them and too much twice much so that
I'll make three times so one two and
once I've done that she'll be ready my
straightening is aren't very warmed up
but it should have done the trick
so trick should on the job so let's go
on just final step number three
hairspray okay so I've got mini vo5
ultimate hold hairspray you can use you
love yell
any anything else pretty one I've got
305 cuz it's really good II actually
fired very tall benefits weather
resistant hairspray don't worry about
whether must you doing the Southside
and what you're gonna do I'm gonna hold
your plat I'm just going to spray it
okay so don't go too over the top of the
hairspray otherwise you will choke what
I did and owe you he'll just feel really
strong like and that's not nice
so what I'm gonna do is have held it in
the bubble and I've let loose and done
it again then hair sprayed it again just
to be able to say so I which you can do
as well and I'm going to take it down or
do it and here I have got beachy waves
it also makes you how look a lot more
full but as you can see up so the light
is getting a bit in the way it is sweep
it and a lot more wasted than it was at
the start if you want to have a lot wave
your head in this because I want a meal
at least once you can get it into sides
and platon both here then strain them
loads of times and then thought loads a
hair spray on and take it down and then
buff it up with my hair spray and then
that leaves you with like really tight
curls but I have loose curls and I
really hope that this video helps you if
you're going out to an occasion or

to beat your hair in general so thank
