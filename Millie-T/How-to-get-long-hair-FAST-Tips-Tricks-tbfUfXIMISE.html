going out your hair I'm still be paying
for the time where I decided to cut my
hair to a bob when I was about seven
years old I'm sure we all went through
that phase where it's a great idea to
cut a hair this long and then the second
day we got it done we absolutely hated
it I did right now my hair just about
reaches my waist now I do understand
that it's not like really long compared
to some girls where it's down to my bum
or anything but my hair's grown a lot in
the past couple of months and I picked
up some tips along the way as to what I
might be doing fit to grow so fast
biscuit I have for you is to wash your
hair every two to three days I
understand that as some of you might
wash your hair every single day and
while that will definitely wet your hair
very very very clean it also does harm
your hair in a way washing your hair
everyday doesn't allow your hair to
produce its natural oils which make it
which makes your hair look healthy and
alive and and also if you wash your hair
everyday in the new goal without washing
your hair for about two days the second
day your hair will start looking greasy
and you'll be mortified so I just
probably say to wash your hair to three
days and at first your hair might look a
bit greasy what use wear a hat or a head
fun to push it back row wear it up in a
bubble or a bun and eventually after a
month or so your hair will be able to go
for about three days without looking
greasy which is perfect also washing
every day it leads to brittle hair and
breakage of the hair and basically that
just prevents your hair from growing
also when you shower massage your scalp
so instead of to put the shampoo on
going like that moving around then
washing it out actually massage your
scalp so I get fingers in there and just
massage your scalp and it helps regulate
your blood circulation and obviously
your blood carries nutrients so all the
nutrients that your blood carries will
be transferred onto your scalp and onto
your hair and it will make it look
healthy
I and everything like that also do not
use super hot water in the shower to
wash your hair because if you use super
hot water to wash your hair again your
hair will become brittle and it will
break and if you can't handle the cold
party in the shower wash your hair
separately in this thing but if you
really can not spend anything like that
maybe just make it lukewarm or whatever
and that will help keep your hair
healthy when you come out the shower
like me you will be very tempted to
brush your hair because it's so not
matted and tangled news when you're
gonna brush through them and make it all
nice and brushed by pushing wet hair for
some reason wet hair like stretches a
lot so when you push it your hand this
is tangle instead of just like coming
loose he actually stretches the hair and
pulls it out if you actually have to
detangle your hair use your fingers or a
wide tooth comb and that shouldn't be so
harsh on your hair but do try and avoid
it if you can and wait till it's dry
also I recommend using the 3 minute
miracle bite all day I absolutely love
the Aussie shampoo and conditioners and
everything they have in their product
line it just it's not like bubblegum and
it's such a nice smell I'm not a little
little girly bubblegum smell to get I
use like 6 or whatever it's really good
organ smell oh so nice anyway 3 minute
miracle you spray on wet hair or
relatively wet hair and then leave on
for 3 minutes
obviously from the 3-minute vertical go
back in the shower wash it out and when
you come out you should easily even be
able to push your hair without it
stretching or whatever to just
completely softens it like the leave-in
conditioner also when it comes to drying
your hair try it and to avoid using a
hair drier and less is for like a
special occasion or you're in a rush I
just but let it air dry it shouldn't
take that much longer and and it's so
much better for your hair the hairdryer
obviously is hot hot air and if it's
called air doesn't really do much for
you for drying your hair but if it's hot
they really just dry your hair really
quickly but then again it breaks your
hair and leaves it brittle again those
are the two words all topic alliance
video if you want to sociable and spend
all your life on YouTube like me on the
weekends try and leave your hair alone
for like two days during the week just
so your hair
to replenish itself get itself back to
how it normally is and by leave it alone
I mean use no put up products on it no
hairspray no anything like that
don't blow dry air and also don't use
straighteners or curlers on air at all
obviously this isn't compulsory but if
you do kind of let your hair breathe
every now and again it will make a huge
difference now our goal biology on you
right now and tell you that you should
probably eat a lot protein because
protein is soon so essential for growing
your hair if you don't have enough
protein then your hair just going to
look dull lifeless and not grow as much
protein is needed to allow our hair to
grow long shiny and healthy and
basically just eat a lot of meat and
fish and you should be sorted for that
also drink plenty of water because out
without the book make sure you drink
plenty of water because without water
your hair looks dull and lifeless and
just boring and fly again to our head
but if you let it have a bit more volume
and accentuate your hairs features by
drinking water that's the best way to go
let me tell you the timing on getting
your hair trimmed is also essential for
hair growth bits let's get it done too
often
your head is obviously going to get
shorter and I have time to go back but
also because we're hormones used to say
to me if you don't get your hair caught
it's not going to grow well then I
always just thought well your hair grows
from your roots not your ends and you
get your hair cut at the end so surely
no matter how much you like cut your
ends or whatever it's still going to go
at the same rate from the top so I
always have that in my mind then I
realized that if you use heat and all
that kind of stuff and basically from
your hair being worn and torn the end in
sight you split ends they're just going
to go snap off making your hair look
shorter so for example if I was to get
my hair cut now I probably get about
that much cut off because it has to do
from a split end and end up being a lot
shorter than I'd want it to be but with
like fresh ends your hair won't stop or
anything and it will be able to grow
faster I don't get your hair trimmed
every three months on average unless you
like it your hair down
whenever if you dye your hair then
probably every six weeks is it six four
weeks or to show off my hair isn't dyed
but I'm just don't get it caught every
four to six weeks otherwise he has gonna
very very very short by the way guys if
you still watch this video comment any
common with the word night in it in like
apostrophes just so I know but don't
make it obvious just put them in
