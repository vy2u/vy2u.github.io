to score your YouTube channel really
quick uh so basically I'm going to
number one for facts
so being sure with your channel you are
doing something you enjoy don't think
see if you tomboy and well actually uses
tomboy anymore
see if you like a tomboy and you want to
become big on YouTube and you look
through anything
Oh beauty videos have the most views and
all these Beauty people get loads of
makeup I could use that and sell it on
eBay or something like that don't just
start a beauty channel if you know
nothing about beauty and if you hate it
so if you hate it
videos will just seem fake you'll be
like a robot might you'll be talking
really like I am a troll but okay Muno
like that but you don't understand so if
you are into Xbox games Call of Duty do
them kind of videos by all means do them
videos if you know if you enjoy yeah and
you know what you're doing then you will
get big on YouTube and you will have
more views more subscribers cuz more
views equals more subscribers I'm gonna
eat a peanut it's more views it was more
subscribers that's like a facts if you
have no bees and how how else are you
gonna get your subscribers so he's going
to make sure it's something that you
enjoy I enjoy doing makeup and I enjoy
doing gymnastics
oh that I've kind of lost my flexibility
now because I didn't do gymnastics for
about a month so but I will continue at
will and Eunice's videos so my channel
is basically a gymnastics and beauty
because even though I not beautiful not
beautiful not beautiful I know when he
comes make things like that and I know
my way around gymnastics so I put them
together in my channel
and put together they mean they boost
they boost of me a lot with my
subscribers likes comments and views so
number two you've got to be yourself
okay I'll admit when I first started
doing YouTube videos I actually wrote
out a script and I'm not I'm not joking
I will tell what to say so if you go
right to the start I think my first
video is how to do the splits and I
thought hey let's give it a go
never never never done a video before in
my life oh yeah I did singing videos
they are deleted and out of my life I
didn't want to speak about them again
Shh okay so go be self in your videos
don't be fake don't write a script like
I did die scripts look for the first two
videos and then I think the main reason
was because it couldn't be asked like
exactly asked just like doing writing
outside of window yeah but what I do
know is that I'm just some girl I heard
up do a video if we could let's stop I
write down notes so here it's really
really realistic effects this is one
step but I just got a few notes down
here so I've got basically things on the
abdomen son so I've got my facts like a
word that will get me so my first one
enjoy question mark do you enjoy a towel
I'll know that second one be yourself
that's my note so these are all my notes
and just go with it because you're not
gonna there's nothing gonna be different
if you think about it if this video
suddenly goes wrong right now I can just
delete it and start again besides if
it's alive I will be doing a live chat
soon though and so that's number two
just completely be yourself
just put down a few notes press record
and just go with it if it goes wrong
people who laugh it's a good thing the
last bill subscribe that I'll be
laughing at you Sam I don't good thing
that people probably laughing at me now
laughing at me not with me at me
so third thing is don't do a channel
about whatever for money the whole idea
of YouTube isn't for money when I
started doing YouTube I had
a clue about you could earn money from
YouTube I didn't know you could learn
money from YouTube at all until my
friend said how much do you mean for
future I was like what I was like
nothing I thought about and then she
said well you're not a partner I was
like I don't have a partner what
and she's like then she taught me
through it that could become a YouTube
partner
so I can meet your partner I was like
okay what now and then she was like
Google Adsense so pay well it's a Google
Adsense and then I got money from that
although no don't know what happened but
Google Adsense is completely frozen it
hasn't updated in ages I haven't been
suspended from anything it's just not
updated in like two months
sorry I'm part of a full screen now the
screen well I'm prepared with both
coming because Cuba licenses for ads
that's all right we've got peanuts stuck
in my throat
then full screen basically and network
so you can't be see I caught him full
screen and then I got an offer from
stylehaul so I was like oh I'm a beauty
my channel is basically beauty guru so
I'm Lucia and so I thought I started
thinking but since with stylehaul but
then full screen have a terms of
condition that says the terms of
conditions I have to stay in them for 12
months
seriously who visa terms of conditions
do you really surface though oh hey I'll
read them and I got to like the second
second word and then the scroller thing
was about this this big stuff so how do
we know that so yeah anyways fullscreen
is brilliant it's absolutely brilliant
really but I don't do this for the way I
enjoy making videos I mean today I've
uploaded about 5 videos just cuz I felt
like it I'm just I'm in the mood for
videos some days I'm like I come after
in a YouTube video
well then even if I'm not in the mood
I'll start recording and then they'll be
like what are we YouTube video Oh
shaking and sooner before you gotta have
a good camera and you're gonna have good
lighting you gotta have a good
microphone so if you're doing it from
your Nakia for looking it's even
possible from that but safe means if you
do from the Nakia
a really old one buff on that's not
gonna work cuz the sunlight you very
something like this and then like you
basically call it from a potato so
you'll like your talk and then I don't
know you you guys won't be in sync with
you math and things like that so I'm
going to I'm gonna upgrade it so I'm
gonna get a unique on probably in a
program where the lens comes out they're
really expensive though like the ones I
want and I'm also getting John you like
um gorillas and and then feel lighting
let's put either side and then I'm gonna
give a tripod no actually right now and
so yeah you couldn't make sure you have
good lighting because if not people
think and some professional and grass so
that's one day five it's not about it's
this is a one on quote it's not about
what you know it's about who you know so
you gotta get in that work now nine
network is in full screen our style
holla I know the networks like that
now it's basically get a good group of
people like your friends so when you
start enough you're gonna have a look at
some people and think well I have so say
when I add about 250 subscribers I
thought hey the sooner but had about
subscribes for me so I thought well I
look for someone else who has the same
amount of subscribers maybe a bit more
because obviously you'd want more than
less when you're real to fair and so I
thought hey let's go into them so I
couldn't on the channel I was like caged
you want to you know join together link
up help you to the route so also when
you help each other out if someone still
gives you shoutouts you might end up
doing collabs you might end up doing
live chats together and things like that
but don't just randomly start doing
clubs
I put mine do swaps as well because if
you start doing clubs and you don't know
the person properly then you're probably
gonna end up getting raped let's be
honest and so make sure you know some
people and that helps you a lot
something since if you have if you know
say and your people Justin actually that
many well it is
but if they contact you as well safe you
know 100 people and if you don't hundred
people up sorry my my mind just went to
peanuts hmm
I need two peanut this peanut taste like
Miller's cookies
why is these peanuts like cookies that's
up MA this peanuts taste of cookies so
you need to know you need to make sure
you know a lot people because if you
know a lot of people you'll gain things
they'll help you to the route where you
subscribers stay games this summer
suppress to them in the future channel
so if Charles meant also like you might
be there they're not only today but
they've more than a man that's over that
so that's all the facts are there are
the vital things and same thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
