spit someone please tell me I'm not the
only one that chokes on a spit
so hello guys this video is going to be
hard to make money as a teenager so the
first one you probably hear a lot but
it's really really important honey does
help a lot is to sell clothes on eBay
you get a small favor from eBay at the
end of the month which is a BAE taken
away a fraction of what you've earned
because that's how that's how it you BAE
makes this money that's what most places
do it's not a big deal it's nothing to
get worried about you still end up
making more than they take off you or
the other thing to do is if you are
quite crafty with making things like
badges paintings anything like that then
just sell them on Etsy now I'm not an
expert on Etsy I don't really go on it
too much because I feel like everything
is overpriced on now am I the only one
probably but I do feel like everything
is overpriced on it yeah it's a there's
so many beautiful things but they are so
expensive
however surprisingly people do like to
buy badges and things to put on their
backpacks anything like that which is
completely understandable again so if
you know what generally people like what
kind of badges you'd make they're pretty
simple to make so you could make badges
and sell them online just a kind of idea
to do if you're quite crafty the next
idea it's still tough buy more so I'm
quite proud of this one and all you have
to do is go on your local magazine now
this is what it is like in the UK I
don't know if this is what it like what
it's like in other countries or whatever
but in the UK you can get magazines like
go girl magazine I was in that once I
want a competition really proud I'll
tell you more about it in another video
probably but go girl I've seen Top of
the Pops all that kind of thing they all
offer things you can do to make money on
the magazine now no betting or anything
none of that I'm not going to saying you
that and but something that you can do
is polish embarrassing stories I think
every magazine has it now it's like
those two teens post all their
biasing moments and the top one wins
fifty pounds and all the other ones wins
and they'll be the stories win about
twenty pounds so it's pretty good and
it's about ten stories published now in
almost a most of these are made up you
can make up your own stories you don't
necessarily have to be true but that's
just an easy way to make some money as
well next one is that beating people you
know and now if a lot of people
recommend going to a website and looking
for houses nearby that want people to
babysit
their babies but something I don't know
I'm a bit about that one because I kinda
feel like if I was a pedophile and if
you don't know what that is don't asking
them if I was a pedophile then I
wouldn't then the easiest thing I could
do is advertise my house for girls to
babysit online or boys so I could just
advertise my house and then get girls
coming in and babysitting and that is
like a free ticket isn't it so I just I
don't know I'm a bit worried about that
anyone can invite you to the house on
that website so I just wanna go with
babysit people you know get your mom to
put on Facebook you put it on Facebook
get your friends to put it on Facebook
just people let you know so the one I
have now is don't do online surveys this
is something not to do something that
annoys me so you get all these youtubers
going Opinion Outpost is the best one to
do thumbs up this video if you agree
with me at all I don't know if I'm the
only one with this but I think I don't
think I am when you go online and do
these surveys so many people were
talking about it so I was like hey this
is such a great way to make money when
you go online yeah after you genuinely
have to take about 700 surveys before
you start making Papa money from there
and it's like Oh 50 for your survey but
then you go onto any cuz you're not
you're not legible for this survey well
then why offer me to take this survey if
I'm eligible to do it and that's after
you've answered the survey as well I've
never made a penny out of that I've
tried I spent about five hours on it
didn't work I made the only one comment
below all thumbs up whatever you want to
do I just want to know if I'm the only
one buying this for a roast amazingly if
you you get really good at it then you
can get like so much money off this so
basically it's not money don't someone
that's a bad idea sell sweets at school
in my school people don't really do this
but in fact I know I need eight years
seven years seminary and this guy came
in and it was selling sweets and
everyone was like talking about it all
day everyone is going to in to buy
sweets and by the end of the day
completely run out so that's a very very
very good way to make money if you
school already does it great carry on
doing if it doesn't that's that's just a
huge advantage because everyone will
want to buy it so the next thing I have
one here is to start your own YouTube
channel now I think I couldn't speak
pretty well on behalf of this one
but basically you can't make money off
youtube I'm not personal on YouTube to
make money but if you I know a lot of
people do want to make money on you
YouTube just for that reason which is a
bad idea
well if you're thinking of doing YouTube
videos cuz you just genuinely enjoy it
and you're thinking of doing it but
you're worried about the hate or
whatever do not worry about the hate
just go ahead and do it just tell people
to bug off and just go and start your
own channel like do not bother about
what people say when you first start off
on YouTube people don't hate generally
you'll get one or two pieces every now
and again people don't hate she would
happy if you're worried about people and
your school finding out just don't tell
them it's really simple as that another
thing that is another one of my ideas
all you need to do is just put money
aside so I don't know I just do it
however work whatever works for you
but you'll have five pounds a week
spending money and if you get it in
pound coins or whatever or fat pound not
change it just put 1 pounds of that
aside in a jar and a box whenever but
yeah just like a pound of that spending
money aside or whatever amount works for
you in a jar if you get changing the
supermarket don't spend the change put
it in the jar just put money aside and
then you'll find yourself forgetting
about it and then you'll like remember
and you'd be like oh oh my god then it
could honestly it could total up just
such a huge amount of the future okay so
that is the end of the video guys I hope
you know how to make one he's a teen now
and you can start doing these kind of
things don't get shrooms on this video
if this helped you or comment below any
other ideas you have of your own so I
just don't want to hope you enjoyed this
video and the new video quality
Kendal's in the background add into the
atmosphere is it not thank you for
watching have a amazing day and I will
talk to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
