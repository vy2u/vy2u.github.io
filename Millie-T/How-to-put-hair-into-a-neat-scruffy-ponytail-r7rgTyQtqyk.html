hair up into a neat or messy ponytail
first you are going to start by combing
your hair for it through
okay so just comb it through just really
briefly just until it's like soft to
enough to run your fingers through and
then what you're gonna do is grab a sea
salt spray if you have one or any kind
of pet hair spray you'll have hairspray
I reckon well you might not but hair
spray or sea salt spray I'm gonna use
some hair spray so grab that and then
you can just bring a hair through with
that so once that's all of your hand you
can kind of feel it then you're gonna
turn when you're going to get your
fingers do you like that kinda like claw
are you just gonna get em on your roots
and just pull them up so you're starting
on your roots and then kind of work your
way down
so it had kind of looks like that as you
can see - a lot more volume but it not
as much which thought like stupid
because I find it annoying one or and
stupid when girls go around town we can
like that with hair like that looks
stupid so yeah I doubt and that what
kind of messed it up a bit so I like as
you can see you can't really run your
fingers do it as easily but that's good
so you don't want to like push it
through then what you're gonna do is if
you're noticing like whip my hair by the
Will Smith then you just gonna fling
your head forward without hitting
anything and you're gonna collect your
hair into a ponytail like that now
because it's all collected here you can
just push your hair through at the roots
listen listen to it you can tell that
it's got nothing yeah so keep pushing it
through like ah like that just so don't
wait to the actual ponytail so it's
gonna be on top your head but don't
worry it won't say it like that
and then get it at the start I
eventually keep going down so if if your
hair keeps going down and just let it
and then make sure you get at the other
side too and just keep pushing it
through and then it'll probably still be
on top top of your head and if it is
then just collect it all like this and
still and it'll be like that now and hit
nice test for the bubbling because
you'll still go a bit further down like
bow
so get your bubble tie you into the
bubble
like that and then pull it together so
it's tight as you can see it's still
high but let's do I if you're not happy
with it then just like kinda push it
down a bit and as you can see it like
goes down so that's kind of a neat one
if you want a scruffy one then there's
almost you can do it the roost if you
want it to go for then you're gonna kind
of have to figure that out for yourself
what you can do is get your fingertips
and like push it forward just kind of go
inside that and also with the actual
ponytail itself you can get the comb and
just like push it back but not too back
combed so it's gonna be like that and
that's your final result in the ponytail
and then if you want you can spray
through with so hairspray and you should
stay like that
so if like this bit sticking up then
please don't take it down just like if
any fuel can for the neat one then and
it's sticking up then don't like take it
out put it in again just simply get a
bobby clip and pin it down like that I
don't think I've got a pop bobby pin
inside so like all I'm gonna do is get
the hairspray like that let's bring it
on the bit why one and just like hold it
down and it was hot and it was facing
upwards oh girl it's gonna hold it down
like that it should go down so I'll show
you the finished result with my hair so
this is my finished hair yes I have a
baby girl I know it won't
I don't want to cut it off and it L
stayed back with some bobby pins but I
can't find any right now so I have to
turn it to the side you can tell it's
quite messy but not to my success I
didn't want it to back cold do the other
side it's quite messy on top but yeah
I'd go out like this and I'm quite happy
with this you so and comment how you
feel about it and if it helped you so
room change and I have this is a
completed look I
it's goofy at some places but I like it
like that and I have also back home to
the ponytail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
