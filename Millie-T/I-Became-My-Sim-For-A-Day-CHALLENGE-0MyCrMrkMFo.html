different for this video because I'm in
my stepmothers room because I need the
Xbox so before I start this video I do
want to say it was heavily heavily
inspired by Emma blackberry I absolutely
loved her and the video that she made on
this she basically became a sim for a
day and copied everything that her sim
character did I saw the video so it was
an amazing idea and thought hey you know
what I'm gonna try and recreate that for
myself for some reason I seem to enjoy
putting myself through hell in my videos
no I need the level of TGIF but still
put myself through hell also it's
definitely worth mentioning that this
video is sponsored by EA and that means
that I've done two sponsored videos in a
row that's not what I meant to happen II
just came together that way I've not
turned into a sellout I promise you I
haven't done a sponsored video in months
and then all of a sudden to come at once
but I love the Sims and playing The Sims
so why would I say no you know I also
said yes because I love the video idea I
could create from it so hopefully you
enjoy it so this video could literally
go in any direction the concept behind
it is I'm going to go on the Sims 4 and
I'm going to make a house I don't if I'm
gonna make it a copy of my house or just
a random house and I'm just gonna let
her wake up one day whatever time she
wants to wake up and literally live her
life without me controlling her and I'm
just gonna watch her and I'm going to
note down what times she does everything
what time she wakes up what time she
makes breakfast what time she showers
and what time she goes to bed and then
tomorrow I'm gonna do exactly that in my
real life and it sounds easy but my sim
could wake up at 5 a.m. in the morning
and go to sleep at 6 a.m. like the next
day they could decide to go on a
late-night walk at 3 a.m. they could
leave something cooking for too long and
set the house on fire probably not gonna
recreate that one it's gonna be
interesting and I hope you enjoy so if
you haven't figured it so if you haven't
already figured it out now these sims 4
is now available on Xbox and ps4 so if
you do want to download it there will be
a link in the description to take you
straight there ok yeah so as you can see
we are on create a sim right now and
first of all I'm gonna go for the
personality because obviously you can
literally make your sims to do anything
they are also unique they all have
massive personalities depending on what
you choose for them you literally have
calm
holy creative freedom at this point her
walk all her walk style which is one
that I usually like what is that I can
also choose their hobbies relationships
i shape every aspect of their life
literally okay and I think I'm quite a
cheerful person there Sims become happy
and have fun when eating good food Wow
if buying me that's quite cute
okay the pace now this is where she
becomes me oh that one
that's probably closest to mine that
color yeah I'd say it's a cola that's
very generic looking but then again I'm
a white Caucasian blond-haired blue-eyed
female so it's probably gonna end up
that way but look at this I'm changing
the size of the pupils how accurate is
that so that is the sim complete I'm
pretty sure she looks like me she seems
to anyway I'm not too sure okay this is
the part where you can literally design
like perfect home for your sim you can
choose the layout the size of your house
what's in the rooms you could literally
create your own house
identical I'm gonna become a culinary so
I'm gonna become a chef I'm literally
controlling every aspect of my sims life
like it's mad you have so much freedom
alright so I'm gonna start on this day
now so my snip is in bed and it is
quarter to three I want to fast forward
it without a CBA sitting here for 20
minutes waiting over to wake up okay the
lights have just gone on so it's also
dark outside when she wakes up okay she
just got up now what time is it oh no oh
curl me nope she woke up at 6:52
she wouldn't make it okay thank coach
you made it keeps you wet herself I'm
not recreating that how long do I go to
the toilet oh you'll find out
I have precisely nine minutes on the
toilet what does she want to do next
she's on the computer you know what I
can deal with that what time she wanna
come Peter Oh 733 I keep having to move
forward to actually see the time because
the TV's too far away my eyesight's not
that good because the time is like that
big on the screen okay let's see how
long she's on this but I'm gonna go
twice to speak to feel that she's gonna
be a while okay amazing yes please do it
again just loves a computer doesn't she
thank God
11:34 obviously don't you just love it
when you spend a solid four hours on the
computer I haven't even eaten yeah okay
what times you get food 11:36 she gets
food gotta sit down to eat it so how
long she's gonna be doing that I've
never seen a slow eater in my life
are you done yet this character isn't
Meeks you it was me sort of eager in ten
seconds right what are you doing now
she's washing the dishes in the sink so
I'll have a dish to wash so looks like
I'm watching you do the same so my sin
has decided that to wash one dish in the
bathroom sink it takes almost 20 minutes
so I cannot wait to stand there washing
a dish for 20 minutes no okay why she's
back in the computer no I didn't realize
you weren't working lesser than I would
get off oh wow so she goes on the
computer 136 and goes off the computer
at 4:17 p.m. oh she's going outside way
are you going in there oh she's gone to
work okay 4:50 p.m. is the time that she
went to work so that's the time that I'm
gonna start making my dinner and guess
what time she gets back from work 1:00
a.m. guess what time I got off 652 am
gonna be a long day okay she's just got
in from work at 1:00 a.m. what is she
gonna do no oh my god
I'm not just on that side I bet you just
could have just done outside trustees to
happen to my carry oh my god please go
to bed oh no of course not
oh of course you just yeah just honestly
stand in the hallway that's fine
thank God okay what time can I go to bed
2:40 a.m. I can finally sleep I can't
wait to spend seven hours on the
computer and almost two hours stand
outside one a.m. in the morning
hi 652 now of 657 Vallejo last night I
fell asleep quite early because I was
tired that day anyway obsession we're
gonna put this time I mean the next
thing I'm gonna do is go to the toilet
wait actually I'm gonna prove it to you
and Google the time so I'm just googled
what's the time in the UK that's my home
as well 7:00 p.m. so there's a slight
situation with the toriel is where Elly
and Dominic my two stepbrothers
we're in both bathrooms because I can't
ready for work so I'm a little bit late
7:06 am right now and I have to be off
for 7:13 so it's gonna chill I'm just
gonna chill and also take my makeup off
because I love gymnast and I never ever
sleep in my makeup I did also change
tops just when I got up out of bed so
that explains that I'm also very cold I
didn't think the bathroom would be this
cold kara I'm pretending to be sin for a
day and I had to get up at 6:52 a.m. I'm
so tired
okay Kara's literally right agony aunt
that she is look look I can get off I
can go yes okay what's the next thing
computer for four hours all right so I
have to be on the computer until 7:30
three so I've got 19 minutes I also want
to squeeze in time to shower and stuff
as well okay here we go just to prove
this a screen shot oh okay I'm a minute
late but here we go you might be able to
tell by the lighting change but it's a
bit later it's nine twelve now so I've
just been on the computer I've been
watching Shane Dawson's video I've also
been trying to edit this video and the
first section of it and also I need to
revise my driving theory test desperate
like I failed it last time and I don't
want to fail it again so I need to
vice for that as far as a challenge
course is it this is like really easy
this bit just the hard part was waking
up and also standing outside for two
hours tonight it's not gonna be
enjoyable whatsoever because I live in
the UK and it's extremely extremely cold
at night like frosty and cold and wintry
oh you and me stretched in one can you
get krump yeah okay I'm sorry I'm a
hypocrite I'm such a hypocrite so I was
like oh well I was just so long and then
I lose track of time and it's now
11:43 if you can see on the movie screen
so you can tell but I'm not faking it if
you can see me just nine minutes extra I
spent on there but now I can move
finally and what's the next task I think
is twelve get food that's a really tough
challenge
I have until 116 to e this bits gonna be
so boring so I'm just gonna skip it and
carry on when the challenge actually
gets interesting
okay just suck beans on toast though I'm
gonna have to stand and watch them in
the back you can see because I probably
that's logical hi welcome to today's
episode of exquisite living where we use
the bathroom sink to clean our dishes I
know it's probably not that weird it
just feels weird it makes a bathroom
sink horrible I why'd you want a food
left all this in your sing I'm gonna
have to clean this so well afterwards
liquid by the way I'm just kind of
working with what I've got because
obviously this kind of sink is an ideal
ooh dirty dishwater like icon icon the
thing is it's not extremely murky it's
just kind of murky but that's even worse
okay I think I'm done I've had to put
the ball back in the water so I could
actually hold my camera so I'm gonna
have to give it one more rinse down but
yeah 20 minutes later I'm pretty sure to
clean this plate you'll ever see I do
have an issue with washing up in the
kitchen because he's been normally
covered by bubbles and you can't see the
stay of the water but this makes me
uncomfortable
hi I switch locations because outside
lighting is terrible it's not a great
day it's sunny so I decide to use my
indoor ring light instead but the next
challenge is to go on the computer from
136 p.m. which is in five minutes if you
can see that I have to stay on the
computer until 4:17 p.m. and I have run
out of things to do on the computer so I
think I'm just gonna have to binge watch
YouTube videos I don't know what I want
to watch but I'll find something I'm
just not looking forward to going
outside at 1 a.m. 1 2 a.m. in the
morning something else I do want to
mention they said I've got my driving
same
test today at 6:00 p.m. I'm going to
have to take a 1 hour or so break from
this challenge but between 4:00 and 1:00
a.m. I'm supposed to be at work so I'm
not really doing much and I won't feel
much then so yeah I think that's kind of
a casette supposed to have a break there
you go off my theory test even though
I'm probably gonna fail it Welch will
try fairly for the second time so I
already failed it once right you're
gonna go out to eat or stop off at
McDonald's on the way back because
everyone will get a McDonald's and if so
I'm gonna have to get a McDonald's as
well especially if I fail exam needs
that comfort food tears may have just
been falling from my eyes the thing is
okay I never ever ever cry at videos but
I just watched Elle Mills for me our
video and it was so artistic so well
made such a good message to those who
were also looking to come out as well I
just Wow Wow it was such a good video
so that's Elle Mills coming out video as
you can see it's got so much love on
Twitter it's so so good I can't even
stress that enough and then this is what
I've just got up on the computer to
watch which is idubbbz on the process of
preparing a content cob because I'm
genuinely interested how incredible I
love failing I very rarely fail tests
ever and the only test in life that I
actually care about I failed twice
but yeah McDonald's it is PE here is the
McDonald's dinner you know cooked it
myself worked really hard on it oh my
god I almost forgot the McFlurry and
Diet Coke I've been watching my channel
for a while you know that these to a
necessity especially the diet coke
especially diet gold okay I have 40
minutes before I have to go outside or
like yeah 40-ish minutes and I've
suddenly got really cold like I
genuinely feel really cold so when I go
outside I'm going to be freezing cold
cuz obviously it's so frosty
I've two hours outside can't want to go
in with the mindset that I'm gonna be
able to do it 100% but I like we'll see
okay it's purely ten to one but I feel
like you think that I keep lying in this
challenge so I'm just gonna keep getting
it up on Google to prove it there's a
page okay then that's proof that it's
legit I think that's enough proof I
don't know how I could fake that so yeah
ten to one will literally Alisha I just
had a thought then which was oh my god
what percentage my
phone on some 13% that was gonna be my
only entertainment false was out amazing
so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna
start walking
I'm just keep walking listen to music
and I have this thing where I love
listening to music and thinking and
making up scenarios in my head that'll
never happen
just play both girly things you know
tumblr and that's what I'm gonna do I am
so cold
oh my god I thought 12% on my phone
which is a seven plus would last you
know 20 minutes maybe yep zero charge by
the way if you want to know how cold it
is look at the road that right there is
frost that glistening stuff is awesome
and I'm not faking this you can probably
see my eyes watering and my nose and
stuff like it's really really cold so
I'm literally gonna run inside put my
phone on charge to collect my phone and
then go back outside to show you what
time it is so you know that I'm not
faking it kind of thing if that makes
sense
okay phones on 14% it's charging really
slowly but I'm just gonna leave now they
go to a wall I don't move the screen as
well if you'll to see like that yeah I
actually can't tell you how cold it is
right now like it's literally I just
looked on snapchat 1 degree I'm so cold
and goes on either ok ready almost I'm
cold
ok when the g7x dies it has a tiny bit
of juice left and it's about to die
right now
but I'm gonna go in because times over
okay it's 239 my now waiting for it to
10 to 40 and then I can go to sleep I've
got my retainer in 240 so guys that is
the end of today's video I really hope
that you did enjoy it that's the time
again for reference I'm that's my social
blade apparently that just came up
runned away might be youtuber but yeah
as I was saying hopefully you did enjoy
this video the challenge didn't go like
a hundred percent plan but I did
honestly try my best
I didn't record much of the time during
the day like the main part of the day
because it was no point like I was for
hours on the computer but I really need
to prove that to you every two minutes
like why do the same would be difficult
wouldn't get much sleep whatsoever and
would do random things such as
standing outside the house for two hours
being a sim wouldn't be very realistic
but it was definitely interesting to act
like one per day I will see you in my
future videos bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
