not ideal I'm still trying to get my
filming setup sorted and I'm currently
using my vlogging camera to film in the
built-in microphone as well so a few
days ago I went out to misguided
unsearched so hard for the weirdest and
just most out there clothes that I could
find and I definitely found so this is
the misguided packet she's kind of thick
I think I've forgotten what I ordered we
look so ugly on camera
I see sequins and I already want to
throw up I like glittery things but to
sequins especially on trousers it just
doesn't go I think the weirdest thing
about this entire video is how expensive
weird clothes are they're not elastic
ativ so let's hope that they fit and
we've just got ourselves some flared
sequin jeans these would be a vibe if
you were going to like in 90s or 80s
discs or something that'd be kind of
cool but for day-to-day life I just
don't think I vibe with sequins too much
I would try them on and I'll give my
proper review then anyway but for now
I'm just kind of these trousers haven't
been made amazingly well though this
literally sequins everywhere oh okay
this is something kind of big that I got
when we took a trip to Paris my friend
Loomis really enjoyed wearing like a bin
bag as who called that entire trip it
was like this black hole that look like
a bin bag and I just went and bought a
look-alike so this is a green trash bag
with a nice contrasting grey cotton hood
yeah just not something I'd ever wear
although I feel like it'd be so warm and
so soft I just don't think I'm vibing
with it be honest
learn to say now and I think he actually
likes this Cole which I knew he would
always telling them about the bin bag
coat you loved in Paris that you are
wear this and this was black actually I
like this it looks cool me right
so now we're gonna try this jacket not
really my personal style but you saw
Louisa would wear this so maybe I won't
like it once it's on okay no no for a
split second I was like maybe it's okay
and then I looked at in the mirror fully
and I'm just like no no no no no no
always a blouse so this isn't actually
like absolutely disgusting I personally
would never fail you in a million years
even if I got paid however well it
depends how much pay we're talking and
it looks slightly see-through as well so
I don't really know how this works
what even is the design on it like birds
in a tree a tree either way I don't like
it
hi audio so messed up in this I don't
even need words this just look at what
I'm wearing and what I look like make
your own judgement again
just looking at these clothing items in
a package like this reminds me of my TV
series when I like unboxed ebay prom
dresses and stuff it just looks like
that by the way I just want to make a
point and just let you know this entire
shop came to like a hundred pounds no
joke that is how expensive these would
call thing items are what's this oh the
ruffle pants with a bit of lace on them
as well a lot of frills this is two
things that I'm not really the biggest
fan of it's lace and frills actually I
do like lace ball the under certain
things like my bra hello I'm having to
do a voiceover because the audio is
really messed up in the original clip
like really bad listen yeah that bad but
quick review of these pants they were
okay they were very comfortable not
practical I didn't like the white ball
and it is
very big yeah overall six out of ten
next thing so far also trousers oh my
goodness
they also like ruffled and big and wide
that's insane
I do like the color a lot though it's so
- nice blue it's like a baby pool
honestly they feel quite freeing it's a
lot of layers I really wish that these
look nice because they are so
comfortable and fit me on my waist
absolutely perfectly however the chances
of me going out in public in an outfit
like this are next to nothing actually
on second thoughts in ten minutes I'm
going now so I'm just gonna wear this
and see what people's reactions are so
this is gonna be our ensemble for our
trip let's go see what been things cuz
he's gonna be coming with me yes I'm
ready to go yes yes you're gonna be out
in public with me learned in the fingers
I'm for what a video where I'm wearing
heels just going for a casual walk
downtown people are just doing double
takes more than anything well she's
looking good
oh my god pretty nice fence filming a
main tunnel video web us heels for a day
sound familiar
okay the next thing I'm just looking at
this pattern through the package and I
already hate it it's like blue and pink
okay so this is a no idea what this is
so it's like that it's like a cropped
blouse now the actual shape of this and
the fact that it's a long-sleeved blouse
I really like however it's the pattern
that I'm not the biggest fan of it's
like it's like blue and pink very nylon
II feeling and just not happy that I'd
usually go for like a mandala pattern
oh it's part of a two-piece collection I
didn't realize so it's a two-piece and
this is the other part to it wide like
very long trousers yeah the audio in
this clip wasn't great either but I was
just saying how I actually really found
these pants comfortable and really liked
them I like where I tried them at the
top I'm quickly changed my mind I just
it's just not a vibe so this is from the
misguided peace and love collection
they've had this collection for so long
and usually I'm a massive fan of it but
I just saw this it was like what is this
bright orange which isn't usually cool
and I'd go for and be like fit of it is
so weird-looking this might end up
looking okay on I'm not really too sure
obviously I'm wearing the glass top
right now and I just like kind of DIY
tied it here I think I made a mistake or
messed it up cuz that's a big-ass knot
right there I have no idea waist up but
as for the cool I actually kind of like
it I've never tried this color before
but I think I'm gonna start wearing more
bronzy clothes and I've really thought
about doing a thing but I think I'm kind
of into as well which I could like
experiment and change this blouse a
little bit to make me like even more but
right now I'm looking at it and I really
don't think it's bad at all
oh wow Travis's again I see the word
with talaq and I cringe oh wow yeah they
look a lot worse in person if someone
who look like a model were to wear these
these are looks so good well these are
just gonna look awful on me but it's
fine for this video it's fine totally
okay with it oh the texture is so weird
as well but the colors really nice
get them off get them off get them off
and now we're on to orange I can't
remember ordering misalign but seeing
this is a mini dress I think I like it
oh I remember they say how's the weird
sleeves like really weird sleeves so
like that's the baby dress itself and
then you've got these weird sleeves like
they're not sleeves it's just like your
arm cover it's like an arm blanket it's
kind of crazy yes hello many tears
welcome back to our haul today we are
trying weird and wonderful clothing
guess who's wearing these - Buffy
Arnold's legs that hurts my eyes
Yeah right I said nice crazy I don't
know if I like that Mel you don't know
oh I mean you know what video I'm
filming no I'm fighting the most like
the way this clothing misguided did you
think that he said you were anyway
exactly I would have lost so much trust
for you if you look to them like oh yes
yes that's nice yeah so yeah this is
weird but I do actually think that I
like it
remember you wanted these shoes as well
they're actually disgusting I needed
some new sandals so thought I'd get my 4
year old toddler to make them at
preschool think they'd be cool to walk
in though so apparently I really like
the pink and blue collection and decided
to also buy it as a playsuit this isn't
bad the design again is not something
that I would ever wear however however
it's not absolutely terrible fit I don't
think anyway I don't think I'll actually
wear it in my day-to-day life I don't
think I'll be repulsed by it dude this
one is how it all actually looks kind of
aesthetically pleasing when you look at
it in the package from that way up I
kind of like the sleeves all the like
bell sleeves ish
it comes with tight cough I like that as
well this can go quite well what do I
look like right now and I'm not to say
about this but just look at me and just
make your own judgement it's probably
gonna be a taking off I hope that you
have enjoyed this video my next main

something to do with clothing or fashion
