don't don't think it automatically puts
you surely Lola turns to me like Oh Cara
I didn't do that she just came over
myself as a spider plug I was like I
probably want to interview someone again
but I think I works it was really killed
in relax like it wasn't very like no one
because we were in the influence appears
like the social media pick and there
wasn't many people there which is like
youtubers and stuff it was pretty cool
but then I went to the premiere as well
afterwards so I kinda had the best of
both worlds or Bert of social media
people finally getting kind of like
recognized as having potentially more
like influence from people than like
definitely where you are - Ian's like
collaborate by Jaclyn hill and oh yeah
and they're doing less and less with
like like media companies so in
magazines and more was like youtubers
and like Internet people
