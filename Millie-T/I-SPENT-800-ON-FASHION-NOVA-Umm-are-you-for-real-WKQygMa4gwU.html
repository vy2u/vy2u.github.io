uploaded on this town for two weeks and
I was waiting for this delivery to come
and finally came and it's a fabulous
right and these from fashion over I hate
having a long intro because whenever I
watch youtubers have a long intro I'm
always like yeah yeah nobody cares get
on with it
and now I'm being that youtuber but this
is really important so I did want to say
it something massive is coming up in my
life very soon something life-changing
something that's gonna change my life
and I'm so excited I will be filming all
of it everything to do with this very
exciting thing that's coming up is gonna
be documented on my vlog channel because
it's something about my life that's
changing that I'm going to be vlogging a
lot of so if you do want to kind of get
more involved in my life get to know me
as a person definitely subscribe to my
vlog channel and get ready for those
videos to be uploaded which will be very
very soon yeah things are gonna change
big time but for the better car lane oh
you know if you don't like what - vlogs
and you just want to follow my social
medias or making them follow my
Instagram my snapchat maybe even my
Twitter who knows also one more thing
just a quick little thing and I hit 1
million subscribers on this channel I
hit a few days ago it still hasn't hit
me yet one day I'll be learning bed at
night and I'll be like 1 million oh my
god but I can't comprehend that amount
of people because I've never seen that
many people in one space a hundred
thousand I was blown away because I
imagined that many people sign an arena
or something however 1 million like I
really want to swear but then this
channels gonna get any monetize and I'll
have to go back to school like say thank
you is so pathetic compared to what you
guys have given me like oh my god I'm
Hit million thank you
moving on like but I don't know what
else to do oh my I don't know what I did
to deserve this at all but thank you so
much oh this will make a good thumbnail
I look way better in my head first thing
well why your clothes are so complicated
Oh way to put it oh this sky cue okay I
understand so yeah it's quite plunge
then it's got these batwing sleeves and
I really like bat wings loose because
they increase my self-esteem this body
suit feels that always if somebody shoe
as well please tell me there's because I
can't wear leggings with it if not oh it
is bonus points for that well done so
this is the bat-winged
red top I absolutely love this top to be
honest I really do but it's very plunger
so I have to wear it without a bra so
you can't see that thing there really
like the sleeves as well because they're
really freeing they're actually is not
bottom to the I legit probably I'm gonna
be wearing this a lot I rate it my
backswing sooo oh one day I am so
confused
it's fashioned over a clothing
compliment that like carries different
brands I think it is because that's from
fashion over themselves but this isn't
from fashion or this is from lips and
honey or it doesn't go to sea call that
night so go there you can see my nipple
I really do not understand this thing
literally if I ever buy clothes I have
to tie or like put a lot of effort into
actually getting on I will return it
this is the swimsuit it is kind of too
much I'm not sure if I would wear this
out in public it comes up a lot higher
than I expected and when I say very high
I mean it comes up to that more burgandy
how he goes off the shoulder jacket oh
nice how much is this twenty-five
dollars like 17 pounds so again it's not
that cheap yeah the material does not
feel great again it's a very cheap
feeling material and also the zips look
quite cheap as well it's like one of
those gold zips it reminds me of like
Cheetah Girls doesn't mean like that
like the popular girl in high school
would wear this with some Juicy Couture
leggings right another exciting
announcement that I can actually tell
you I'm getting my car and I'm buying my
car next week and that's still gonna be
a my vlogging channel as well literally
everything's happening at once but yeah
I'm getting my car next week and I'm
gonna plug all that I'm excited
I haven't passed my test yet but it's on
the 8th my fourth test hopefully I'll
have this time so Salaam fasciae 4
attempts
you know it with the pants as well I'm
trying to decide like I don't like it I
don't think this bit here's a little bit
too thin but too thick here which makes
this look too narrow if it was a darker
red I'd wear a it's just a little bit
too vivid for my liking
by the way ignore the order in which I
show these clothes I rearranged Clips
when I'm editing and stuff yeah if you
just see a clothing item before I've
actually tried it on in the video it's
just cuz I've rearranged the clip ooh
why did I order these you know they look
a little bit better on I think they're
high-waisted cigarette trousers I don't
know how I feel about this belt I don't
know if you can see on camera actually
there's just a lot of silver holes in
them
I'm Kim and Kim you must have tried mum
so if you can remember I said first I
weren't sure about these pants however
now I've got them on I really like them
even the belt doesn't bother me because
once it's tied up you can't see as many
feel like silver holes in it at all and
it's comfortable and I feel like this
against Alfie would maybe go with a
blazer and some heels because again with
the heels I'm getting like businesswoman
fives ish and I kind of feel it I feel
it lazy morning roll oh I love my rolls
makes me feel like a 34 year old mum
called Sharon that definitely owns a
Range Rover Evoque that has a husband
that's about 65 years old so fairly old
beliefs very rich and that's the whole
reason why I married him
Sharon would wear this world exactly
what I expected is black the entire way
round just whoever all of my pajamas
when I'm just chillin at night and stuff
now we're on to the black robe you
normally wear pajamas with this so I'm
just gonna put it on with this dress but
yeah imagine this is like a pajama top
or something and then it's just like a
silk little dressing gowns throw all
over if you like wanna go for some food
in the middle of the night or whatever
so this is a burgundy slip dress or like
bodycon dress this was $10 so this
wasn't too expensive it was a good price
oh yeah you know how I say oh it feels
like it's like a nylon your material
that's because it is 92% nylon literally
this look this could look amazing on or
look disgusting
I'm not too sure okay so I have the red
dress on it's very type like very tie
and the kind of material it is means it
clings to everything like you can see
where my ribcage ends or like where my
ribcage kind of is you can see where my
braaaains
doesn't do a good job in the whole
self-esteem field yeah it just kind of
clings to everything
I mean I really do look here a this I
just would never wear it out
Oh green we're off right now
oh it's two-piece cute this is just a
little crop jacket looking off the
shoulder top is it off the shoulder it
looks it this is from this is from
fashion over themselves as well and then
need bottoms
ah I like the feel of the material but I
feel like this material really like
clings to the knees and shows like you
know what we only need when you can see
someone sneak with leggings I feel like
it's gonna do that we'll see that oh how
much was this oh wow sixty dollars
that's probably why I like it quite a
bit okay so this is a army outfit I
really like this top actually however
the bottoms are kinda they're a weird
fit they fit really well around the
waist actually they're just a little bit
higher on like the leg area but I think
that's how they're supposed to be
everybody looked like that the ankles it
stops way too short like they are too
short but I like the color and they fit
really well I think this would be so
good if the pants were shorts because I
obviously then the length wouldn't be an
issue this is from makers of dreams
Marissa crop top this is $20 and I like
how it looks on the model as well on the
top always got elastic a thing like I
really like when crop tops are
elasticated around this area
it just means sit like when I raise my
arms in the air like this like it
doesn't like come up and you can see my
brow and stuff which happens with more
crop tops new tech specs and then it's
got a long sleeve like kinda like but
once again I like it I like it okay I
have the plain black crop top on and I
really do like it there's something to
not like about it nothing I can fall
about this is a bell sleeve black crop
top and I'll be wearing this a lot
definitely this was $13 and this is a
Kiki crop top Millie can you get any
more basic it's important to have quite
a few basic essentials in your wardrobe
so yeah fashion all produce a lot of
their own clothes but they also carry
other companies that produce clothes
that they then sell so this is the white
crop top I was talking about before it
fits really well I really like it very
comfortable however it's very thin so
you can literally see the pattern of my
bra underneath and stuff but yeah it's
comfortable it is originally a little
bit longer than they so it's not
actually that crops but with these
shores I think it looks better to have
it a lot
shorter legally dress in ivory or in
white basically with exactly the same
style of an elasticated sleeps the crop
top I just showed that's really cute
it's it oh it's other one dresses it oh
no I think that short ish the model
looks amazing in this dress but she's
definitely had a boob job
so something look the same on me I
honestly don't know I'm in two minds
about this I love this top bit and has
this really nice panel design I like
that a lot but as I said before the
length literally goes just down to my
knees and I hate dresses that are that
length
I really wish this was like a lot
shorter or even maybe made into a
jumpsuit I have no ideas got me twisted
satin dress in olive so yeah the only
fall colors that I know are kaki
burgundy white and black
oh okay the kind of the style of the
scope which I really like on dresses is
it goes like that it's like that shape
like a triangle so these are my two legs
and the skirt goes like that and I
really like that style so the idea
behind this dress is great the colors
nice the shapes really nice however the
split here comes up a little bit too far
when I say a little bit too far I mean a
lot too far I could never ever wear this
in public unless I just like stapled
this down which probably wouldn't work
yeah it's a little bit short I also
apparently bought a burgundy jacket oh
it smells weird if it fits right and by
that I mean if the bottom like literally
sits on my waist or just below like he
doesn't go on to my hips I will really
really like this that aspect is
literally gonna be the make-or-break so
the length is actually pretty good
lengths not bad it's kind of it weird
though because when I made the whole
thing like so you can have it undone or
maybe a little bit or maybe a little bit
off the shoulder hmm I think I like this
jacket I think I do
the reason I like jumpsuit so much is
because I'm just lazy so I don't have to
take time matching my top and bottoms I
can just literally put the entire thing
on dead oh no it looks it's called the
red and green stripes so I feel like
he's just gonna look like fake Gucci
oh no okay now I've got the jumpsuit on
now I feel like I know like I'm about to
go scuba diving it's so comfortable I
really like material I really like the
kind of sculpting edges here I read that
a lot and however it's extremely long so
I have had to like fold up the bottom so
many times this is my favorite thing
that I ordered
well bread stripes short sir this is a
coordinates outfit and it's basically a
striped blazer with striped shorts as
well and this I absolutely love it it's
so like I can go to a business meeting
in this but I can also go for a stroll
on the beach with it so there the shorts
plain silver ones but they've got a very
elasticated waist which I love since no
limit to how tight you want to take them
just in case you hate your wife and want
to suffocate yourself that's wrong
oh I think that's probably design though
actually I'm trying to think what I
prefer to place it was like more cropped
or do I like how it kind of goes over
the shorts as well like a dress almost
$50 okay pablor that means it kind of
looks nice on okay um here it is do I
like it yeah I think I do actually I
really do like it I just have an
obsession with places lately and I just
find them really comfortable but really
classy looking especially when you can
wear like a bra laughs or like a crop
top underneath and this is a red dress
it's got adjustable straps as well which
is good because it means that it will
always fit in this area because you can
just adjust them is it called roached
like a this brought in in the middle
there yeah
okay okay now we're onto your basic love
red dress now I do like this I have
nothing to fall about it I'm just kind
of curious as to what these things do do
they actually tie to me supposed to pull
them and tighten them or something
whoa look at the difference with that
now after just tightening it that is
amazing
like I absolutely love the neckline now
I love how it's like shorter hair and
then gets longer there
that's what is the incredible Wow I see
checks played top this is a new addition
to the edgy side of my style but doesn't
probably exist basically an outfit I
absolutely love wearing is heeled boots
leggings a crop top and then wearing
like collared button-up shirt as like a
jacket wearing it off the shoulder so
I'd wear this is like a jacket I like to
wear it a little bit off the shoulder
maybe not this color they don't really
go the best together cuz they're like
side of different shades and then you
warm for the night and if it gets too
cold you can literally do it all the way
up I'm putting it all the way up as well
to keep you extra warm it's top secret
buddy see you just to plain a little
bodysuit I really like and also
something that adds to it it's the
orange and white stripes down the side
I actually really like those straps I
weigh more than I feel like I should and
I'm not too sure why I like them so much
I think it's that cool combination this
isn't the best you all to ever exist but
you're just gonna work with it and I do
like these style of tops where the
client log straight across however this
top as soon as I move I'm gonna fall out
of it like I just know I am for a fact I
can feel it every time I move it's just
one step closer of this coming down and
these going up I also bought about this
is no they still read really black I was
like this is kind of colorful but it's
really not yeah it's just a basic little
dress I already own a dress kind of
similar to this but it's all black and
this is kind of more interesting I feel
like it's the plain black tie bodycon
dress but then it's got this like mesh
thing over the top that kind of brings
everything out a little bit
it's either gonna make me look thick
with to seize off that and there's only
one of them that I'm gonna be happy with
okay this is another one of the dresses
and it is so unbelievably tie I don't
think I could wear it on an eye out like
I literally feel like some kind of doll
is just being like I don't know I wonder
how long before my blood circulation
stops oh that's really cute this is like
this is similar to a white still group
that I own like similar to the black one
I just showed only why but it's a dress
I can actually wear out and I really
like that hmm it looks kind of
see-through though which is a bit
worrying okay this is the white dress
that Kylie Jenner wall and this is
really on the edge this comes up quite
far and I can keep pulling it down
however I feel like straight after I
pull it down and just come straight back
up again I think I like it I really do
like this
Oh
I thought it was being adventurous and I
realized it's not about the pattern it's
about the color and it's still black and
white these are like some baggy kind of
summertime lightweight pants these were
$20 as well so not too bad
when can I ever wear them other than
when I'm on a holiday though I feel like
that look weird to wear right now after
the pants the pants very comfortable I
like them I can see me wearing these in
summer but on the length through a
little bit too short
they're like literally just past the
knees and it kind of looks a little bit
odd it doesn't look natural oh we've got
some edgy patterns the white on the
front black on the back and that's why I
like them because they were just because
of the contrast I feel like then tie it
around the thighs and then get loose on
the calf so it's like kind of that shape
that it becomes which I kind of like
okay now about these pants I'm not
really a fun I like the idea behind them
how they have like the white and black
contrast and stuff I do like that I
think it goes well with this top in the
knee area it literally like sticks
clings to my knees and you can see my
knees through it and it looks really
really stupid so I wouldn't wear this
but the new stress me out so it's
another fashion Allah is kind of here in
miss because the thing is you've got
fashion over and then you've got about
50 other clothing brands they also carry
which probably are like different levels
of quality so you never know until you
get them and you also don't have those
same risks you have when you show up at
misguided which is you buy a clothing
item and then see 50 other people
wearing the exact same thing when you're
out thank you so much for watching and I
will see you in a future video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
