style main channel video currently I'm
in LA which is why it's such a weight
setting if you do want to know what I
get up to in LA go to my flow tunnel
deluxe being uploaded currently and I'm
with all the social climbers in LA
today's main channel video challenge is
I tried being a teen mom for a week I'm
so happy with how this video turned out
it was definitely a challenge took so
long to edit and put together but I
really hope you do enjoy it if there's
any particular video you want to see on
this channel leave a comment down below
and I will do the ones that you guys
want to see the most subscribe like all
that stuff
enjoy title on Saturday we're gonna be
purchasing the doll I don't know what
all - yeah baby I'm about one of these
big one so I actually wanted to buy a
doll that was a really realistic doll to
cry in the middle of the night and stuff
I can find that so I'm going to have to
get like a genuine doll is those kind of
dolls you have to get you park an
organization something stupid I'm
officially we're going you're a mummy
I'm gonna go meet my child now why don't
you call it MJ Millie jr. I wanna Polly
Satan oh I'm so happy she's in photo so
he had to buy them from Argos instead
yeah I'm screaming inside she's bigger
than I thought she's life-size right
yeah of course
oh that's disgusting you just given us
so many diseases how she's fooling she's
fooling dad okay me if I had a kid oh hi
everyone it's Monday so stay one of me
officially being a mom here's my child
you know how I said I wanted to buy a
realistic doll that was because this one
I'm just it's gonna be hard to get into
the vibe of being a mom when the dolls
like clearly a doll I really wanted a
realistic looking one so I'm gonna go
grab the baby carrier real quick I'm
gonna take this challenge seriously in
the sense I can't just get installed
right now and just lay it on the sofa
because obviously if it was a real baby
I couldn't do that so I've got to put
the baby carrier on while I was holding
the baby
this is way too high them girls that
something just happened that I knew
would happen and he is so embarrassing
so those women kept looking back and
kept staring and I knew they were
looking at this like baby on me and she
goes free she's like I thought that was
a real baby for a second there I was
like oh it's not I think everyone in
public that I walk past thinks I just
have like this way - obsession for dolls
it's fine every car that goes past
everyone's freaking staring dead the
same girls again when I'm walking back
so I feel twice so good you guys say
something yes it's a whole moon oh my
god it looks I didn't realize how body
block it's 20 bucks to in the
morning right now so if tend to Tuesday
but still Monday there's a pure gym near
my house which is 24 hours and I really
want to be there right now just 24 hours
and I love working out at night
however Spencer's not home and I have a
child to look after which means like
hard I was literally thinking quite deep
into it I was like if I was genuinely a
mom right now like Teen Mom so many
there's so many restrictions like so
many things I can't do like go to the
gym it's currently 19 minutes past 7:00
in the morning I set my alarm to wake
myself up
as if the baby was crying and I have to
sit here and cradle it like 10 minutes
until it stops crying I'm extremely
tired
I don't do early mornings I'm not having
a good time right now
I know none of you are gonna believe
that it's actually this time so I'm
gonna get it up on through this what is
the time I just searched that that's
what we thought came up I know no you're
gonna believe me either so I'm going to
do this to try and prove it to you and
it's not 7:00 at night because in the UK
we have 24-hour time so if it was 7:00
it would be 1923 and if you can tell my
my face I don't want to be awake right
now I don't know and I don't know what's
more stupid me faking the challenge or
me putting in so much more effort to do
it properly sure this is how baby sleeps
at night she's really comfortable can't
wait to collect my mother of the Year
award so in this video I feel like you
need to do a slight disclaimer on it the
maybe
I wanted to do this videos for like
literally a better part of advanced
attainment it's a main channel video
idea it's not to be taken too seriously
like I know I didn't get the full
experience of being a teen mom obviously
but I've tried my best I try to get as
close to it as I could but more than
anything this video is for entertainment
purposes but yeah don't take it too
seriously and enjoy the video hello it's
the next day baby's here of course I
still actually need to be out and ask
you guys when I should call the baby
because I just need a name for the rest
of the challenge but a little bit of a
fork in the road right now so means fun
to both feel like going to the gym
usually be perfect we just go together
usually it'd be great we do pre workout
together there we go and then we come
back if it's a palimpsest it's a good
time but we can't go together today
because there'd be no one to look after
baby so I'm gonna have to go and then
when I get back Spencer can go bring
nothing it's lift it's like three days
all these losers right what's this doing
in my house hey what you saying weeks
Angie thank you yes I am daddy
I don't know this place to a child I
don't want you in here
new to London they said don't take to
the gym you know what
another day of me being a mom and today
we are going to Selfridges but I'm not
gonna take the baby carrier and the go
to experience life is a mom today having
to actually carry the baby boobs outside
so I'm gonna go now but it's gonna be
interesting it's a big mood
are you ready to then I'm not I'm not
I'd literally been in here one second I
walked through the door the woman behind
the perfume counter said something to me
about the baby and laughs and I think
she said she said I didn't even wish
said well then Trenton baby so I know it
was father's I didn't hear her I think
I'm actually building a connection for
you know my keeper so far I'm not
minding here but my opinion is
definitely change we get annoying over
the next few hours
yeah they I'm getting just hard I think
she sees him do this I literally start
doing this in Selfridges and they just
literally walked away 20 gets publicly
embarrass so easily
I've not even been here for long and I
already can't be bothered to hold it
anymore we should've been here for half
an hour and he stressed me I would be in
my arm I just want to like keep picking
things up but I can't because one of my
hands is always not available tits
holding this now calm you say he's gonna
help how it's going to play the dead
girl right daddy at your birth just in a
family day out taking the kids around
the shops screenshots we we love mommy
moment say I'm not being a single parent
for today
you just got judge started in the inside
I'm really struggling to open my eyes
cuz the light is so bright but today is
Thursday which means we've got two more
days left today and tomorrow and then
we've done for this challenge but today
I went in to Tesco's like a few hours
back and looked at the baby section just
out of interest just to see you know
wife one day I do you become a mom what
I'm in for what a baby section looks
like and just literally when they're out
of interest and this is what happened
so today's Thursday and first of all the
first thing that went wrong I haven't
got a hat for the baby so when I'm
crying in public is so obvious to these
plastic and fake now so that's even more
awkward but this is a kids section I
just came here out interests me like
Bradley was a mom I what would I be
you're looking out and getting I think
I'm already confused
I feel like he's child abuse like feed
your child any of this oh my goodness
Wow
what okay breast milk Wow yes savanna
yeah yeah came here out of interest
don't really understand
when I do feel like maybe having a child
in future well I have to feed it their
stove because I feel too bad so I walk
into the kitchen and out of nowhere calm
he's just holding the baby like it
literally diva scrapped it from the
chair and stars cradling in don't to be
fine
oh you want to be a dad for me
so today is the most monumental day of
the entire week because I can finally go
to the gym because I'm gonna go
responsible ven doesn't want to go to
the gym today he's gonna go up it later
on
so technically there will be someone to
look after baby turns out I didn't end
up giving them a name man they're just
gonna be called baby for the entire
video ah now you can enjoy your bonding
time with baby oh you know what she
looks kind of comfortable I'm thinking
here babies yeah and today is gonna be a
traveling day because I'm going back
home up to Manchester from London to
Manchester ish area it's gonna be a
first holiday I'm so excited are you
excited today is just gonna be a test to
see how it would feel to actually have
to carry around a baby 24/7 because I do
this journey a lot I've just never done
it with a baby before so every time I
get to use in the station I always have
this routine where I'll get a cell range
or indirectly and that takes up two
hours so also it ought to be holding
this it just didn't work out I literally
could not get a drink because I had food
I've also had to hold the baby but I
also can film that as you can see where
I'm sat was basically no room whatsoever
so if I did have a prom there's no way
that I could put it I'd struggle so much
to find
actually see where I want to say
you're a lot of hard work I also wanted
to add a conclusion for the challenge
and how I found being 18 month of the
week honestly it was a lot harder than I
expected like by far the amount of
freedom that got cut down for me when I
had this baby was absolutely insane I
couldn't just go anywhere on the drop of
a hat I literally had such a big
responsibility with me
like I couldn't drop everything and go
to the gym I had to find someone to look
after the baby because even though one
morning when I got up at 7 o'clock in
the morning it literally made me tired
for the rest of the day I fell off for
the entire day after that especially
being a Teen Mom like with all the
hormones you've got the make you more
tired you miss out on more sleep like
it's just moms in general teen moms
single moms I have a lot of respect for
you because even though I only got these
smallest taste of what it's like I can
begin to understand how much of a
responsibility is it's literally insane
hopefully you enjoyed the video that is
the end of it I will see you in a nother
main channel video in the future leave
your thoughts in the comments and I'll
see you in a future video bye guys
