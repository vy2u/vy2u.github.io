gonna check and see what you guys

that and it's gonna be painful but it's
gonna make a video it's definitely gonna
be a challenge video enjoy we love a
challenge
we're gonna go for these for the
challenge the ones with the nice
platform on them
Carmy you're practically a size 7 you
can try these on now how do you feel
knowing that girls wear these for like 5
hours my fake tan is so Patti right now
so i'ma go try and fix it with this
video ok this is gonna be a disaster but
we it will give it a go anyway oh yeah
you're gonna get it all over the floor
they haven't even draw idea I'm gonna
put them on and we'll begin
No okay with these heels on the first
stop these Nando's commies that write
the time right now is one minute past
one but I probably shoes on exactly what
o'clock so today it's probably gonna be
a busy day because I want to actually
made this a challenge and I'm definitely
gonna be unable to move by the end of it
yeah so I mean the uber right now
sitting down isn't exactly the most
comfortable thing cuz these heels so
high up there like I can't put my feet
flat so I'm literally like feel like I'm
on my tiptoes and it's not the coolest
thing in the world great start great
start
Milly just hopped out the uber and his
heels in the pouring rain you look so
like out of place and everyone that
windows staring at you the biggest
mandals in like Europe as well I
literally am gone I started at what 10
past 1 is 20 minutes it's now half past
I got the real time up as well
I my feet already her like even just sat
down with my feet on the floor it hurts
because you really try there we go
okay back home now got a wipe these off
real good or though I spent 11 forget in
the floor dirty and it is 20 past two
right now so I've been wearing them for
an hour and 10 minutes if I was actually
going out I'd be in so much pain right
now but because I've been sat down for
quite a bit of it it's not too bad even
though it is still extremely painful
being sat down in them it's just the
size of them they'll sort all get over
commies yes I'm so my hair out real
quick this is a mess where's the next
trip to call me we are there good
Tesco's I haven't showered in three days
and I'm still very strong I talked to my
makeup in the house and also straighten
my heck she was a mess it was a fat
shower hats toe and right now
I'm walking so sorry she's just trotting
along I don't like this at all this is a
bad idea I should uh to work out in
itself I'm telling you now
mommy I'm so insecure right now people
in the bunch is there a need I feel
insecure literally this is how slow I'm
walking right now
surrett testicles now I'm stealing the
heels you can't really tell about my
height on the camera but I feel very
tall about the diet called session right
now yeah that's a first start my goal as
painful as the arm it's kinda useful
wearing women's stores and socks it
means I can like use the top shelf
without putting in that much effort so
it's all cool what do you think of the
heels you like them thank you Neku big
mood so now I feel really insecure in
our place because I've actually got a
load of stuff in my hands it just looks
so impractical I'm wearing heels right
now oh my god Millie little spill milk
all to wear in the heels literally what
the have been those so awkward I'm so
old good after all that we're getting an
uber home because there's no way that I
can walk home in these heels like right
now he's just not on the cards
I'm literally beginning to hate these
things after what just happened I'm so
upset and awkward
we did get fresh milk though nice little
spontaneous trip of the day is I'm just
gonna nip to Argus who Spencer obviously
gonna be wearing the hills as well
that's not gonna be too massive which is
gonna be probably stares at these people
in the store the most random shop ever
bin bags here um a mop and a 10
definitely in pain right now if you can
tell by the positioning of my feet I'm
literally like they're just dead they're
just like a limp and lifeless it's not
standing still for so long just really
her this is so dangerous these stairs it
stops deep okay right arm saw like my
kitchen stool thing and they have
nowhere to rest your feet and my foot is
literally numb and it's tingling right
now and I don't think it's healthy it's
so bad and I'm in so much pain it's
loosely but it's on my ankle is well
like it's tingling all the way down like
from here video guys I'm gonna be
playing some basketball with Ben some
basketball were then also the fakes had
when
a step too far and they are literally
orange right now but game season you
ready guys
oh wait all right I see you Oh Frick
sake no just don't even try it oh my
gosh
big mood yeah but I want me to fall over
and break it and could be funny for the
video Hey
okay the time right now spin layer is 5
to 6 and we're at the park right now me
and van you know living out our
childhood dreams whoo first thing I'm
noticing is that this floor is very
spongy keys my heels literally simple oh
my god you've made up a stock okay wait
you really gonna walk across this I'm so
I have respect for you MIDI T you got
this come on next challenge is the
climbing wall I just already know this
isn't gonna be a successful i'ma try
anyway this is me trying to reach my
goals ready guys oh god I'm scared
he's the fact that I'm in heels I know
that if I fall I'm going to die cuz I
can't land on this now you'll be fine
I'm here to catch you don't worry about
it
I got my arms wide open for you when you
follow a lot of stairs a lot of people a
lot of stairs highs all right let's go
I haven't mentioned this loads but my
fear in pain just know that every many
progresses it gets more and more painful
and my toes are literally like seasonal
right now and it's literally I still got
love with that new feeling that my uncle
that I explained
the troop section of this vlog is now
complete
okay so this is what the night has
consisted of just a chill night in
playing for and I still haven't landed
yet they're not actually heard me that
much at the minute because they're not
like resting anywhere although my toes
are very squashed still especially since
I've been wearing these literally all
day they are the highest feels ever as
well it seems an absolute nightmare
we also mind you to put the lamp up
finally in our living room it's been sat
in a box ever since we first moved in
and now it's up it's having a cool
little vibe as you can see but these
heels are gonna come off shortly and I'm
so excited because my feet are in so
much pain
I've just been sat down on the sofa with
my phone and camera next to me loving
life I'm scared to stand up he's gonna
hurt that but we got back in at about
7:00 and if you want to know for
reference what time it is now and how
long I've been sat on this sofa going
off Ben's phone because mine's currently
dead and I haven't got up to charge you
for hours it's almost 12:00 a.m. yeah if
you're interested in my pajama ensemble
you've got my Jacob why Highland Spring
merch and with a pair of leggings and I
actually kind of wish that was fake I
was just not human and finally Louboutin
heels I don't know if I actually
mentioned this in the video but I'm not
actually going to be wearing the shoes
for bed because that's not really a
challenge whether I wear the shoes or
not will make any difference and won't
be any more painful because there's no
pressure on them because I'm literally
like led down flat so there's literally
just no point like that wouldn't be a
challenge whatsoever so this is the part
the final part of the video where I take
them off like I've ever been excited
something more than this I know I
haven't exaggerated for this video I've
been like oh my god am in pain
it's helped me I'm like paralyzed I
can't move I'm in so much pain because
it's not like that because I think I'm
past the point of that much pain where
it's just like hello home in the
background where it's like your feet the
circulation is closing off see your
doctor see your doctor it's okay now cuz
I'm let down but just standing up before
just her so bad are we ready the floor
feels so cold everything feels so like
breathing and cold my feet being so
sweaty bormanis TMI but it's just facts
ladies and gentlemen oh my god look at
that I think that was already there but
all of this was and that's just like
collected there cuz I've been wearing
them all day obviously my feet feels so
light as well amazing so that is
everything for today's video I really
hope you enjoyed it's a few days later
now and I just want to say that my feet
are still recovering they hurt so so bad
even why I mean this wound you strainers
I can still like feel them just just
right on the knuckles of the fee it just
doesn't feel good at all let me know in
the comments what other videos you want
to see maybe me putting like a fun twist
on something or anything like that
okay everyone I'm gonna go now but I'll
see you in my next main tunnel video or
