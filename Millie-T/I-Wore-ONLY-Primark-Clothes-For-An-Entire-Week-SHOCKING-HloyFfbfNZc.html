video I'm going to be wearing nothing
but Primark clothes for a week but so I
don't just walk into the store and just
find the nicest outfit so that I look
good every day I'm going to put a bit of
a twist on things and I'm going to
choose my outfits in different ways for
example I'm going to choose some of the
outfits blindfolded or the ones I went
to get strangers to pick for me or the
ones my mum's gonna choose all the ones
I might use a random generator between
three ugly outfits and bearing in mind I
am actually going to have to wear these
in my day to day life in front of people
out in public and if these outfits are
disgusting
and there's a lot of questionable things
in Primark I can't do anything about it
and I have to wear it for an entire day
and put it online for hundreds of
thousands of people to see that was
really dramatic I am actually excited
for this challenge and it's something
new anyway I just chose prymaat because
there's a huge range of different
clothes so more horrible but then some
are really nice so if I put a random
aspect into this when I choose the
outfits the results will be interesting
and also prat melts just a well-known
store in the UK for everybody so that's
why I chose Primark and in the future I
might choose different stores my new
different things with choosing outfits I
already have some planned but if you do
have any requests you can comment them
below and I will definitely be sure to
do them hopefully you enjoyed this video
anyway and let's get on to choosing the
outfits
okay we're approaching Primark now I
don't know if you can tell but it's like
kind of festive behind me and came into
that Christmas season I'm not
Christmassy yet though at all oh my god
yeah they got the Christmas decor up
there his mother which is going to be
picking some of the outfits as well and
then a few strangers might be I don't
really know we're just gonna wing it and
yeah and don't with some outfits at the
end of it I kind of like what that shows
a little chillin ice okay mom so you can
choose my first outfit oh my god I'm
scared right she's found the Christmas
section I'm a mum loves Christmas um
oh my god
are you genuinely getting there Alex
16-pound you get that half-breed first
outfit complete oh my god
okay so whilst my mom's off doing
whatever and finding some more ugly
outfits I'm very scared about I've come
over to this section because I think the
wintertime like for my one outfit that's
actually nice
I want to choose like a minister go it
with some ties and then like a top that
I can talk in okay they're really nice
actually I love my heeled boots I think
so the burgundy dress and these boots he
has everything thank you very much thank
you so Lee Anne who was the girl that
you just saw helping me out there has
just picked my outfit and I'm really
happy with it looks really nice I
especially like the boots as well
because I like my heeled boots as you
can probably tell I put them on right
now I don't even think that shoulder on
the camera okay so now I have got four
outfits and there's one outfit left and
in this one it's like the finale I'm
just gonna be completely blindfolded and
just pick anything and everything
eyelash extensions are ripping off I can
already feel it
okay this one seems like quite a plain
tarp so I think the thing that we bad
about it was it
no does she look walking through this
door like this forward on your right so
we're in the shoe department now I'm
just going to take Melissa some shoes
boots keep going forward just scanning
the outfits now how do you think it went
I think he's gone great but wait the
outfit I picked is the best of all oh
it's actually disgusting I'm one picked
one outfit and it's absolutely horrible
hello and welcome to day one of the
Primark testing outfits video thing so
today to start off I'm going to wear the
outfit that I chose which is the skirt
top and heeled boots with the tights as
well okay someone did consists of these
tights here
they consist of these boots that I
absolutely love and by the way these are
boots like Chou's when I was blindfolded
but they are leather on the shoes that
were chosen so I have to wear these with
the outfit so yeah these are the boots
with this black ribbed top tucked into
this khaki green skirt and I really like
this skirt if it fits well I'll be in
love oh this is the outfit I am
absolutely in love with it I haven't
worn skirt in so long and I'm wearing it
with ties as well and it just looks so
classy I was gonna get a white top but
I'm so happy that I got a black tops you
just look so elegant as well and
especially with these boots I know that
I'm absolutely gonna love this outfit
but yeah I'll keep you updated on this
outfit but it seems to be strong too out
of 10 so far okay so I'm on the train
I've been on the train for a few hours
now sat in the outfit it's very
comfortable
no problems with it whatsoever however I
had to walk to the train station right
which isn't that much of a big deal at
all but the thing that's the big deal is
what I'm about to tell you now and these
shoes right here have no grip
what I feel like I look so deformed
right now but these shoes have no grip
at all so I was walking through the
shopping center on marble floor
I slipped so many times I almost
face-planted people were staring legit I
might as well of being on an ice rink it
was not bad I was just sliding all over
the place and I look like a polka call
me come you know right right this outfit
how much do you think it was like if you
didn't know of my friend of my child was
my friend yeah it was like eight pounds
like four pounds maddening you're like
legit how much what's that chain from
Primark as well do you rate the outfit
so my main channel you're gonna be a
link Jacob I love it doesn't look like a
Primark outcome I like I told you I was
like I genuinely thought the Crimean
Prime Meats is good yeah so we going to
be going out and you're all gonna have
to see you're all gonna have to be seen
with me wearing this obviously yeah
commies like you know making it better
hates being embarrassed in public
yeah let's go someplace go it's like a
really fancy right so funny so yeah and
then my mom chose this outfit as like a
joke cause she's me Oh Anne the carpool
karaoke thing in the vlog yeah she looks
a bit low form okay let's get dress into
this you're not that review call me look
great honey yes you like it yeah you're
great
you like it ready to attends my
breakfast paper happy about I love my
friends okay
outfits on
what's going up read okay well let me
see 11 to November then I'm Way too
early but it could be worse but yeah
thanks mom for choosing this outfit love
it oh my god don't set off as if he did
that I was propping up the camera on his
car there's even a her as well and I
raid the house just very small it keeps
coming off which makes press to eat and
normal action said too much Batman
assays what disturbs me ride the ice
like walking faster well yeah quite a
minute I'd experience for like a
day before Christmas problem I hate me
why you anyway yeah it's all anybody can
take pajamas I just come in to st. with
it now so yeah there's a lot of people
around you know and can obviously pirate
sound flogging sits in his local area
and like people know him boys deal with
it
yeah okay so we outfits off now but
overall review on the elf outfit em did
you see men stare Spencer yeah
definitely yeah hi so I'm watching this
video back right now for the Wednesday
outfit and realize that I never actually
showed you that outfit so I want to show
you some of the outfit now I can no
longer show you the jumper because that
has been left at Jacob all Karma's house
it's just not here anymore
that's what the jumper looks like it was
like a cropped gray jumper with the hood
it was really nice and comfortable
however something I wasn't comfortable
are these leggings here so these are
normal leggings but they are high
waisted and have a really thick
waistband no no no they were way too big
on the waist video right now you like
try for me today I did take it to make I
think it looks so good so I've had to
put on another jumper on top with the
jumper that's from Primark I find that
as well which is there because it is so
cold outside that like the jumper on its
own really doesn't do anything and also
like any kind of wind just go straight
through the jump when it's so cold these
leggings are also so annoying they
literally keep coming down and I keep
having to pull them off
I need a belt it all have any like
loopholes for that so I can't do that
either and this outfit was not a success
in terms of comfort whatsoever but in
terms of like how it looked it was okay
that I'm gonna wear today it's one that
the worker picked out may also excuse my
parents I've just literally got up and I
have had like not a lot of sleep for the
past two days so yeah I'm quite tired
and so today's outfit is one that the
worker picked out and she if you can
remember did this like burgundy dress
with ties and then and heeled boots as
well today we are going into London
Spencer's here we are well going to go
into London for a meeting so I'm happy
that wearing this outfit because it's
comfortable I won't have the same
problems yesterday like we would like
it's not fitting in stuff so yeah
okay so I've just put on the outfit now
and I thought
would be like more of a slip dress so
literally straight down but it's not it
kind of just sit in the right place
which is good so he doesn't mind
literally drown me which is what I was
worried about because I always wear like
belts with these kind of dresses but
it's not too bad at all it fits really
well and I've got the types on as well
well because I have all these types a
few days ago I don't know if you can see
that yeah you can have literally but
like a lot of marks already hopefully
they don't get worse because if they do
I really don't want to go into a meeting
with rips all down my thighs this yeah
I'm gonna do my hair and makeup now and
then we can get on with the day and I'll
keep you updated the primer video trying
to fix with this because this has a
cooler it's quite smart you might need
to kind of work so the work hasn't
chosen is you did well you did well
although I do have a job here in case of
duty to dress down a little bit cuz I
said like this means you only have to
dress marks it's more like friendly and
I don't to give away too much asshole
but just like a friendly meeting it's
not like a big like business without
proposing anything or any find out we're
just kind of working together so yeah
it's very smart I don't know how I feel
about it
yeah yeah so today's the very final
outfit challenge this one is probably
one of the worst walnuts cuz the elf one
I wore that as a joke people could
probably tell it was a joke but this one
looks I'm being genuinely serious and
this is the one that I chose when I was
blindfolded so the jeans that I picked
are like fine and I actually really like
them they are high-waisted skinny jeans
it just depends on how well they fit and
stop
I'm joined by Jordan and chuckle he'll
say things like Gucci what do you think
Jacob I think it looks like you've just
retired you want like something that you
think is stylish for isn't true
so yeah let's go put this up yes the
jeans are so comfortable as well and
they are very high waisted which I like
because when jeans say high-waisted and
they stick here I'm like that's not my
waist
I don't know purposeful or not so I do
random like hole in it there
I can't only first pop the design on so
we walk into an Italian me Spencer in
Jordan to e and Jordans friends have
been roasting my t-shirt now on and
they're like oh you gotta fly away now
what kind of put to play today
and I feel like kind of walking that far
ahead to make history embarrassed I
don't really know
good Spencer and Jordan got a trim but
Jordans embarrassed about it I'm not I
just look like a barren oblong Jordan
look at me and see tongue out oh my god
you eat a long story is no story is what
excuse me
I had a ton of kid staring at me are you
done Spencer and I think that was
because they like my top which probably
is the best thing um it was cute anyway
it was cute but not my style at all the
jeans on the other hand was so
comfortable I rate them okay my overall
review on Primark if you go in knowing
what you're looking for and how to spot
good quality items you can get some
amazing outfits for example my Monday
outfit and that sound wasn't even human
oh my god when I was younger I adored
Prime hug like I loved it I went in
every single day I got my false and
males from Primark I got my accessories
from Primark I got everything from
Primark because I loved it
and you could find some really good
quality stuff in there as well but what
I discovered from shopping there when I
was younger and even shopping there now
for this challenge is that it is also
quite hit and miss the khaki skirt and
even the alfalfa it was amazing quality
but like those black leggings the
high-waisted one with the elastic band
waist really really really did not do me
any favors kept coming down all day
didn't stay up just didn't fit right at
all if you want to see more these weekly
kind of videos we'll leave a comment
with your requests and yeah I really
enjoyed this video and I hope that you
enjoyed it watching it as well so yeah I
will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
