Oh monetization hello everyone it's me
Lee if you're not new to this channel I
might look a little bit different I have
my hair dyed gray and also caught a lot
of shelter so that's a little bit
different to last time I literally have
only just had it done but then I had it
done again cuz I got bored of blonde
I've been blonde all my life I fancied a
change anyway today I'm going to be
trying on wish clothes for a week I
don't like doing these videos I mean I
do because the phone but at the same
time I actually have to go out in public
wearing these outfits and if through a
disaster or if they look ugly then I
just have to withstand it and in this
video there's definitely one piece of
clothing this very questionable that I
don't really wanted to go out and wear
if you don't know what wish is it's a
website it basically sells everything
and it also sells really really cheap
clothes and quite questionable kind of
hit-and-miss anyway I really want to the
video now and if you want to subscribe
you can if you want to stick around and
see more videos like this in the future
you can add your quite a few wish videos
now and ebay videos eBay videos kind of
giving us why my channel actually exists
it's kind of like my brand
but I've also reviewed romwe Aliexpress
everything five pounds calm just cheap
clothing in general I've been doing it
for like a year now I love it
see you on one day when I try the first
piece of clothing hi everyone so this is
day one and I'm gonna start off with
kind of a more casual wear just because
I'm just going out for a meal with Nikol
Ankara if you watch my vlog channel
you'll probably know who they are so
I've gone for these high waisted
leggings they look very figure-hugging
like quite tight on the waist which I'm
very happy about but I just I don't know
I can't imagine them Fame very well and
then you've got the crop jumper as well
absolutely love my crop jumpers however
it's like minus two degrees outside and
this jumper is thin so I don't know how
warm it's gonna keep me okay I've got it
on so these are very like waist hugging
which I'm quite happy about to be fair
and this goes really well together as an
outfit oh my god that's stressing me out
are they equal yes this crop tops just
cropped enough to still like show up
it's doing you'll still be a little bit
revealing yeah and the pants are like
high enough and really comfortable as
well welcome to the whole weed out
section where we see if it's a good fit
on the back yeah it's alright but yeah
I'm gonna go out for my meal now and
keep you updated hi Cara what did not
love him
hi Cara you know so many people actually
think that I'm the vape girl because
Lewis made a joke about it on Twitter
she been sat down I finish my meal old
and all it was actually really really
commendable however the pan kept like
riding off quite a bit and you like got
kind of uncomfortable I think your best
on my like this no I do like it yeah
let's see what Tuesday's outfit hi it's
Tuesday sorry if the lighting is a
little bit off it's very early in the
morning and my studio light is he sacked
freak Swiss Tuesday now and today I'm
going to the gym so this day is going to
be very interesting in terms of the wish
outlets because I'm going to aware this
two-piece to the gym that I bought from
wish and it is these red leggings like
so they are high-waisted which means
hopefully when I do squats and stuff
they won't come down and also I've got
this crop top which is long sleeve which
is great for the gym at all
and well I mean no I did buy some back
up top so I'm gonna go and choose one of
the other tops to wear is this the
journal protection or I'm really
confused it's fine will do will do okay
so I'm literally only just like the
house I've already noticed a massive
issue the pants scratch up so bad like
they're making my legs so itchy and so
irritated so especially for a start
sweating and start doing squats or
whatever this material is gonna irritate
me 10 times more the pants are so
painful they are irritating my skin so
much I started doing weighted squats
like 30 seconds in and it just felt like
my legs are being scratched it
was so irritating they have left an
imprint on my legs like the limes the
ribbed design yeah what would I use to
describe these leggings um dangerous so
it's Wednesday now today is kind of a
big date she's gonna be like a bit of a
vlog it's not like a massive day I'm
getting my hair done however I'm getting
it cut very sure and getting it very
great so for that I'm just gonna
literally wear this like winter dress
and I've got from wish and I really like
the look of it it's like a jumper dress
and again it's burgundy I apparently
ordered a lot of red without realising
that feels really comfortable it feels
quite sure a lot sure than I expected
I'm hoping that he doesn't like write up
as I walk in stuff that's gonna be very
awkward but it's really comfortable I
really like high neck like jumper
dresses and the way that they look so
I'm gonna put my thigh high boots on
with these as well okay dr. Tommy subway
as you can see I'm on a diet coke she
getting a nice little diet coke with ice
no surprise I literally live off it and
this dress is coming over woof I'm
flashing everyone I'm pretty sure it's
kind of awkward keep pulling it down it
just keeps coming back up again there's
no controlling it oh yeah I am
officially Gray's definitely gray Oh
like more silver I'd say but I
absolutely love it I really really like
it I think I like it anyway yeah so as
well as my hair now being dyed gray also
have to talk about the clothing it came
up won't and I was sat down and when I
stood up I knew that it come on so much
and then I'm walking and I keep walking
and I go to feel behind me it's just not
cool for in the back whatsoever and my
dress had gone old way off as well oh
it's so embarrassing I don't think
anyone really knows since I didn't know
I didn't look back to check I was just
saying you just keep walking keep
walking
yeah anyway I'm done now I'm calm I
literally spent the whole car trip they
just talking okay it's Thursday now I'm
here we come you know a college hi
everyone what's up and I'm also about to
go and grab food I've got my outfit for
today wherever it's gone okay today's
kind of a simple one it's just black on
black I've got these black sweatpants
here that I'll show you which actually
and they actually feel like pretty good
quality so I've got high hopes for these
actually let me feel and then also I've
got like this cropped black thing
it's long-sleeve I don't I feel fit all
the sleeves are really small but we'll
try it anyway and see hopefully it will
fit if not it's gonna be very
uncomfortable day
for me okay so we get changing to that
we will see what we think literally if
you like some kind of mannequin with my
arms out like this because I feel so
restricted like I can barely move at all
this bit fits fine and stuff and it's
okay here and it's just really tight
around this area and also it's very
tight just on the arms in general they
are actually so comfortable but like a
drawstring which means you can literally
tie it as tight as you want around your
waist and also on the back it's got like
good pocket so you can put anything in
this world you like oh basically it's
got really thick pockets on the back
which can actually adjust in yourself in
actual how does it feel to be the only
blonde in the group now
oh you're sober I'm you um its last day
this is an outfit that I'm not looking
forward to it just looks like I have
genuine bad fashion taste looks like a
raincoat but it's a dress it's a polka
dot red dress and I'm going out today so
let's get you into that okay this is
even was nice mate it's not even fitted
around the way so he could look kinda
like kinda classy like above it and then
edgy style with it like flowing out here
it's just literally straight down I look
like a rectangle
one day I kind of ER so she's gone with
the day that look is can I install -
because she's filming a video or if she
maybe bought that being serious and I
don't want to offend her let's go
family outing you've judged me a lot of
times in my life but I've never seen
such a disapproving look that must mean
it's pretty bad well I was gonna keep
here I was gonna wear it to your wedding
but I guess now we just have to go for
different bridesmaid dress so we're just
outside curious because I need to go to
Curry's to get a new MacBook charge
because when I've got right now is
broken so I'm gonna have to go in and be
there for a while stood at the desk
talking someone who works as try and get
a new charger looking like this so Kawai
and I think my mom's not enjoying either
because unwillingly she's becoming part
of the embarrassment I'm just gonna
pretend as oh no you can't do that say
hey
so that was interesting the first place
I actually went I got a comment on it so
there was a woman that worked there and
she was like looking me up and down she
musta noticed I was staring at her like
staring at me I was a bit like wow like
that's all so I think she goes I really
like your dress
I'm like yeah because she was like she
was on time almost well I'm almost like
it's for a bet and I was like you should
have played you out so I was gonna be a
because I would have been like well
thank you so much like it's my favorite
thing at you know where I'm special
occasions and today's one of them then
she was a bit more understanding but
still didn't really know what to say
because she'd already been like wow I
really like you dressed so she couldn't
always wouldn't be like oh yeah it's
really ugly like thank God I know what
to say and then whenever someone was
serving me or talking to me it was like
they were trying not to look at the
dress but they definitely noticed and
what did you say before like looking at
it didn't know how to tell yeah she's
there there's some rich eccentric person
or some portal for a straight out of off
the streets
I'm um also want a subway and it's
making me warped as a way to get her the
sandwich because she refuses to go
herself and I'm really really awkward
right now I'm just passing a cards been
staring at me this whole time I've been
vlogging right there
I'm just running that wasn't too bad
they literally didn't even really react
to our only thing that did happen I
think this is just me being paranoid one
of the workers that just went it's like
what did you just say day what did you
just and it was like I can't remember
sorry I forgot you know if you'd like
handed it something like been like what
the hell is she wearing and then it's
like wait what did you just say he's
like nevermind oh my dad forgot he's
like trying to fake him out I wasn't too
sure but um you're just really awkward
just I think that's my paranoia though
you know back home now and if you watch
my vlog channel you probably feel like
you watching a vlog right now cuz this
is how I unlike all my vlogs when I'm at
home all in all which is very hit and
miss just kind of do you research before
you buy the clothes like look at the
material and asked whether it could be
an irritating terry material whether it
could be too thin do thick it is a
complicated design whether it could look
a lot worse when it arrives in person
etc you just gotta kinda do your
research before you buy an item I guess
let me see the end of this video hope
you enjoyed it and I will see you in my
next main channel video coming very soon
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
