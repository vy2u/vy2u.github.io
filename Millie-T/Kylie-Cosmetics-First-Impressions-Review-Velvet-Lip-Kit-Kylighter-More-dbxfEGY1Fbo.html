I'm in focused I only own two lip
products from color cosmetics I own
Dolce K and candy K and I absolutely
love them so I place in order to Kylie
cosmetics and they were doing a sin
Patrick's Day sale which meant that I
got to free lip glosses or what metals
of my choice so I thought that I had
just about enough to do a whole view by
the way next week I'm going to answer
down with some YouTube friends so if you
do want to feel as well so make sure you
subscribe to my vlog channel below
that's going to be a lot of obstacle in
the future okay on to the video
literally package I got from Kylie
cosmetics cosmetics cosmetics so after
the website the prices aren't too bad
however customs gets me every time cuz I
live in the UK comes over gets tops a
custom end of having to pay like 30 quid
so this folks wanted in the shade heir
asking that's how you say it it looks
like hair panels right here but it's not
I think it's air but look I'm not good
with pronunciation at all if you've
watched my eBay testing fake makeup
you'd know that because I went about the
video and pronounced German I like to -
a lot of the comments pointed it out but
it's a bigger one is a list metal I'm so
interested to try a lip metal because I
have never tried a metal lip gloss
before but they always look so cool this
one is kind of a nudie metal this slight
like peach undertone so I'm quite
interested to see how it actually logs I
hope we doesn't wash my skin colour out
though ignore my foundation is really
patchy I've been like taking on and
taking off with glasses for a while
definitely go with the summer long maybe
peach I I was just hoping that it would
be a bit more pigmented and have a bit
more fuller coverage on my lips but I
definitely don't hear like I don't hate
it at all a light tire is flex-a-lite I
could do the silver this one is
literally it's a lip gloss
I believe with literally you can only
get this one in gloss form compared to
can decay which you can get as a liquid
matte lipstick and also a glassfish when
I think you can only get as a gloss I
really like the color looks really
similar to candy table stock side the
people are like and icky it's like
identical to dull cheek a oh no to fact
that the dull TK is in a liquid matte
like a matte lipstick where this is a
gloss so let me came up is that much oh
no it's all good they're not worlds
apart but literally is definitely more
of a pinky nude whereas Delta K is
definitely a brown nude okay so now I
actually really like it
canny basic nude gloss I really like it
I don't know if it actually is but on
camera kind of looks like it are
engineered which I guess it is next
thing I've got was the candy cake gloss
we can do okay
liquid matte lipstick I expect my Holy
Grail makeup on it a little bit I like
it so so so much the only thing minutes
frustrates me with matte lipsticks is
when I go out and live how to eat
something or whatever there's like a
solid line that breaks off the matte
liquid lipstick and it just doesn't look
good
and you can't score much stuff either
liquid matte lipsticks and curly
cosmetics you have to use good what six
make a why to actually get low matte
lipsticks off they are so hard to get
off
okay the next one is eight kicks so I
thought oncogenic snapchat that she was
hauling her new velvet line she said
they were kind of a mix between the maps
and the glosses as they appeared to be
almost matte but there were a lot more
creamy and didn't drive and I got it in
the shade harmony I'm pretty sure it is
quite a pink shade I thought it would be
slightly more nude but I'm not too
bothered at all because I'm looking at
it now I have way too many new lipsticks
like they are all nude they're all just
different forms of nude so I'm quite
glad to have something a bit more pinky
obviously it's a lipstick it comes with
the lip liner I love Kylie cosmetics the
products are great the lip liners not so
much they might have updated them the
actual formula of the lip liners
incredible so creamy so moisturizing all
of them just actually sharpen a few
times the actual lip liner pen just
comes out is that what you're doing can
you see that but I am something why do I
tell everything when I am walking with
the harmony that they've updated the lip
liner and it doesn't come out as much I
feel like there's nothing more
satisfying than brand new lip liner I
love the applicator for harmony it's
just like a sponge
I love the basic sponge applicators
yes yes yes I am absolutely in love with
the formula of this as I said before if
it makes it between the glass and the
matte lipsticks and yes it is just so
static trying to put on and I absolutely
love how it looks as well and it's not
drying at all Kylie's such a good name
to incorporate into makeup products it
also you got the tie line sir so the eye
line is you've got the chi liners and
then you have like for example the chi
brow kit okay we highlighter on its way
I'm not overly keen on the packaging it
just looks like a peach box which is a
bit boring compared to say brands like
benefit traveling the best packaging
I've seen in my life and then you get to
Kylie and it is like an Avant well can I
get that they want it to be sleek
themself you can't even see the Kylie
logo on it which things look like a
peach box I got this in a shade French
vanilla as well the actual chi-lites box
is what the heck with them the sort of a
ballad man I don't know but it just does
evil croce and it doesn't matter so
obviously it's not but if you want to
review that I'm just obviously going to
say like my opinion on it
mister obviously I do like how they've
incorporated big brands will go with the
dripping effects on to the highlighter
and I want to give it a go anyway
everyone I think what I'm going to do
now is I'm going to compare this is the
harmonium it's color by the way I'm
going to compare the Anastasia bulk it
swatch on these finger
Twiggy Kylie Jenner highlighter
Anastasia broke it do we sell a
highlighter it's actually quite
pigmented more than I saw I did
underestimate it anyway I'm going to try
it on my cheeks and see what I think
this turn into a comparison video I
apologize
we're so caught this really quickly
while this is my highlighting brush
hello it is Hyuna comb brush it's on
beautybay by the way if anyone wants to
get one not sponsored can be very very
generous
okay I really like that and that usually
would highlight I go quite drastic or
not really goes down the natural route
well this is a very natural highlight
and I actually quite like it I'm going
to compare it to summer and I shouldn't
really be compounds it's not a
comparison video but if it helps you get
like a better idea then that's cool yeah
can you see how the Anastasia Glock is a
lot more pigmented that's more natural
but that's a lot more pigmented but I'm
definitely still loving this and I'm
definitely loving the lip product as
well harmony well this I know I didn't
purchase a load of stuff but I feel like
I purchased enough to do a whole lot but
I was doing shopping hauls and testing
things on camera don't forget subscribe
to my vlog channel if you haven't
already here is my pure box if you ever
want to send me an email letters
anything like that but it's all for me
have a beautiful day and live life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
