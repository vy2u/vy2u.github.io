be a little I mainly bought bath bombs
but there is one item that isn't a bath
bomb that I'll show you later on in the
video so the first thing I have here is
called the butter bear
it's made from cocoa powder and it has
like it has a very strong vanilla scent
to it and when you put in the you back
it has no color to it so your bath still
stays the same color as it was before
but it makes the skin really really soft
so if you're thinking shaving your legs
at the same time that's a great idea a
piece of advice I would give you is if
you're thinking of getting this do not
put your hair in the bath because it'll
make your hair really greasy I'm
guessing because like if you put butter
in your hair it make it greasy probably
the same thing kind of Asst so I'm using
that example okay if you really like
like colorful baths then this is your
Luxury lush pod and I probably recommend
this one I got it because it's very
Christmas themed as you can see it's got
the mistletoe on the front and also a
six dream the colorful so you've got the
pink on the bottom the wives green the
red the blue the yellow the blue there's
just so many coolest on there I think
it's a blue try sin this isn't as
moisturizing on your skin as to puts
berries but it still just moisturizes
skin and then I like why the bath bombs
is that they don't actually dry to get
out which is something that I had a
problem with when I was I used to have
really really really sensitive skin this
thing Saul is extremely christmas-themed
and it's a melting smell man it is so
cute I think the noses broke off though
but it has a very cinnamon spice smell
cinnamon spice this other thing I think
it is it's one that if I were to get
like my stepdad or any guys to smell the
normal bath bombs from lush they just
pull up all the face with this one it's
like a cinnamon smell so they actually
really seem to like it and and I don't
know how I feel about this wrong the key
is very very strong it it might be a bit
overpowering in the bath but again this
one leaves your skin feeling very very
soft and this is my baby bath melt than
a bath bomb mmm this Academy Martin and
I have totally loved to candy mountain
bath bomb it smells so good it's like
vanilla and bubblegum I wrapped in a
sweet embrace still good it turn into a
bath like a baby pink call that makes
you glittery I'm guessing because it has
a lot glitter on it but gosh the smell
on this is absolutely gorgeous this next
one I got is called dashing Santa and it
smells really really nice actually this
is where our favorite smelling ones but
every time I smelt it he seems to go
right over at my nose because the powder
is really loose on it and my nose just
things a lot my eyes start watering but
it smells of Christmas whatever smell
that might be and also like a citrusy
smell kind of like a refresher sweet but
a strong down version I'm just in case
eating from the name dashing sanitary
it's gonna like run around the bath it
doesn't like it's gonna like Swiss
around the bath it doesn't it just kind
of stays in one place but it leaves your
bath a orangey red color but it doesn't
leave you glittery um doesn't leave the
bath literate or your skin glittery but
I'm not sure if it moisturizes or not
I'm not too sure about that but it's a
really good bath bomb and it smells so
nice alright this thinks one is one
that's only available at Christmas time
but I think every single back on her guy
is only available around Christmas time
once a year it's all limited edition
apart from the butter bear I think
that's available every year all foodie
year and it's still very a lot of people
like to stock up on it so they'll get
about 5 in stores and just set them up
and keep them and I decided to be cheap
and get the smaller version just to try
it out and never had it before
well judging by what people say people
say that it well it smells of candy
floss and pear drops and bubble gum it
smells very similar to candy mountain so
I mind just pair the two together
this one doesn't actually have that much
of a shimmer to it it has a slight
shimmer to it and I don't think that
angles rubs off on your body afterwards
but apparently a lot my friends use it
on their hair as well I say that it
works
really well on the hair so if you want
to use only head golfer and say that it
using your hair when you like swish it
around during the day people who smell
it then thank you all so much watching
this video I do really hope you enjoyed
this video anyway any products you
bought from lush and loved
go ahead below just so I know what to
buy now and there will be more videos
coming from me soon again thank you for
watching have a positive day and don't
forget to stay beautiful bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
