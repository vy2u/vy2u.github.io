hi-yah so I have a review here of the
ilaria products I have to the L'Oreal
Paris l5 ordinary oil mist is the first
one the second one is the and the second
product is the barmy glasses first thing
I will review is the extraordinary oil
mist hair shine this retails for nine
pounds 99 or in US dollars $14.99 and
first thing I would like to talk about
is sleek packaging now a lot of people
really like the packaging of this
because it is its glass packaging which
obviously always makes it more stylish
now obviously refer to a review video I
do look at all the people's opinions on
them online to see if I can pick up
anything or what other people's reviews
are and what they said is the reason
that they liked it in a glass packaging
and I like it for tourism as well is
because you know how much is left now in
a lot of hair products the packaging is
opaque so you can't see what how much is
left and you kinda have to shake it to
guess but with this is pretty obvious on
how much this left
if you have said well I don't know
because I've only had this product for
four days one of you said that they have
used it they they use it three times a
week for seven and they've been doing
that for seven months and they're and
they've only used one third of the
bottle so that would mean that there is
still about that much left so it does
last a long time
I still up sells for only $9.99 or
fifteen US dollars so I want to say that
is bad at all that is really good
especially with how long it lasts
because a lot of people depending on the
thickness if you have Kelly / straight
hair they only use about one squirts
each day if you have quite thin straight
hair if you have more curly thick hair
I've used up in a ponytail like - and
they probably use about four or five
squares it is obviously very very good
quality it's glass and in the pump is
good as well
another thing I really really like about
this is you can lock it by turning it to
the side and that means that you can
take it around with you without worrying
about it I'm kind of going everywhere do
keep looking down but I pull out love
notes here and on the next page as well
of and when I thought about the product
and so that's why I keep looking down
one squirt covers the whole head so it
goes do spread out so I forgot out wrong
place
there you go it does kind of go around
the whole head here it's not greasy at
all it though isn't one thing that's
sweet about it but on your hair all it
does it makes your hair feel soft guys
the main thing of this product one
review actually said that it leaves your
hair feeling soft for days both of you
say it leaves them feeling soft for
about 12 hours or so but either way just
make your hair feel soft for a long time
it protects against heat as well so if
you spray it on your hair and you want
to straighten your hair then it does
protect it and because what you can do
is you can spray it dry or after you
pull out the shower it works more better
or it works a lot better if you do do it
when you have come out of the shower but
when it's dry it does leave a nice shine
and makes it feel nice and soft and it
does give it a weightless finish which
is really really good so people were
very impressed
there with this and some people do say
that it's quite expensive for nine
pounds nine to nine or fifteen dollars
but in my opinion I think that is a
reasonable price I think it is a very
good price actually for the use okay so
first of all the packaging packaging is
plastic but it does feel like a good
quality plastic is I like plastic that
I'll just break I think if you just
stand on this then it'd be in just
staple inside because it does feel like
very strong plastic and as I said if I
do you like to sell the top and a
solvent butter now they decided for this
originally and I know you do see a lot
of these children lipsticks and things
like that but this one it doesn't make
you up I don't know it sounds ridiculous
but why I've heard is that you always
like bombs and things like that they
actually dry your lips at ma so you keep
putting it on and eventually when it
runs out you buy more because your lips
are still feeling dry but this one it
honestly really does moisturize your
lips and does add a lot of color onto
them now the different colors I have
here is is mad for pomegranate by the my
Kuja sin for peach and the dragon fruit
now one thing that might be downside is
that you don't get what you see now if
your sponsor EULA Phillips don't
actually go that color oh you'll have to
actually call that color your lips don't
go that color
they don't go any of these colors they
is kind of a guide the color on here
it's what it is
because this meant to be crayons
inspired because oh sorry take the top
off this is what they look like and then
you've got this twister at the bottom
that is it twisting it up the product
goes up with it but honestly I wouldn't
want this color on my lips the color
that it actually turns out to be I
absolutely love now you will be able to
see another slideshow at the beginning
and I'm which color is which because
it's just basically a guide but when you
go to store you get testers at the front
of them
so if you're worried about this might
turn out to bright or it's not the
cooler than you think it is going to be
then just get the test that's on the
store try them on if you like the color
buy it if you don't then try another one
or don't buy it only the thing that I
like about these is that it has a a
kaleidoscopic glittery feature to it so
when you put it on just feel really
really glittery but another really big
positive about these is that because our
crayons they do not make your lips still
feel sticky or gooey of any one away
these for how to choose one I will
probably say is nine twelve since the
peach this one here because simply
because it is a really good nude color
that is perfect so that is why this one
is my favorite but if I were to go out
for like it's not at would cause pipe
dark colors and I would choose this one
which is dad the dragon fruit and what
each one of these is perfect and for a
special occasion there are six colors to
choose from altogether and I know there
is bite the by the maracuja my tea
pomegranate dare the dragon fruit and a
sinful peach and I don't know what you
the two coolest are but I know they are
ready and pinky colors I read in the
pink I think and uh one downside that
the quite a lot of the reviews mentioned
as well and what I find is that they do
not last for very long so you'll have
the man to say see Hallows and you'll
need to reapply them but he's not too
much of a problem because you just came
out there carry them around in your
handbag they are not an extortioner size
they are quite small actually what they
are so all you to do and pop them in
your bag definitely suitable for all
ages it's also great to collect because
they look so good in your makeup
collection I mean I put them in and just
because the colors are so obvious and
bright they do look amazing in your
makeup collection honestly definitely
definitely recommend because they do
everything they say they are an amazing
product and I really I'm finding it hard
to criticize anything about them so I
highly recommend today Thank You L'Oreal
