doing my everyday makeup routine for the
weekend
there is a everyday makeup routine for
school on my channel but for this video
it will be for the weekend so I hate
long intro so let's get straight into
the voiceover after I make this really
quick announcement the announcement is
that I have a email which is
make up with me only 24 at gmail.com if
you do want to send me an email at all
to do with anything then just email me
there and I will reply and get back to
you so yeah that's my quick announcement
and now on to the video the first step
is to hold my hair back with the
headband that I've purchased and
accessorize on the makeup goes into my
hair next I use your mail fix and
perfect to prime my skin before applying
any foundation
I used to be male
wake me up foundation because it really
does wake me up in the morning because
they say I am such horrible pale skin
when I wake up in the morning so I'm
always really tired as I'm addicted to
YouTube so anyway I just blend that all
of my face to give me complete coverage
and a really nice complexion when you
walked in i next I use a selection Mac
first powder and to play it I use a
sponge that comes with it the exciting
that works amazing at coverage and it
just makes it pigment even better and
the shade nw20 in case you're wondering
in the winter and i apply your under my
eyes especially because i feel like it
helps a lot with my dark bags i find i
get under my eyes next I use Urban Decay
big fattie mascara one of my all-time
favorite mascaras ever and I also love
the brush in here because it's so thin
and tiny and it separates your lashes
amazingly so I'm applying that now and
it just goes on so smoothly it adds a
nice gloss to your eyelashes I'm just an
implement together at all I also use it
for my bottom lashes
next I use most amazing palette ever to
apply my eyeshadow on is the
accessorized palette packaging is
amazing and look at them colors they're
all neutral there is about 36 colors I'm
not too sure but before I get started
that I applied the elf eyelid primer all
of my eyelid and also I use it under and
over my brows as kind of a and brighten
and highlighted for my brows and I also
apply it a bit under my eyes as well so
yeah keep watching for that next
actually used to eyeliner brush from ELF
to apply my eyeshadow which is a basic
pale color to go as a base and I apply
that all over my eyelid I use that brush
because I find that it works best next I
apply this brown color that looks like a
dupe of the Naked 2 palette snakebite
color but it is really really pretty and
nuts pigmented and I also use a eyebrow
bush to apply it but it does actually
work wonders for this type of thing and
I obviously apply that to the outer
corner of your eye as the dark colors go
on the outside of your eyelid and I also
bring that up to my crease as it doesn't
make my eyeliner look to others well
because it's dark anyway next I apply
this really nice color that looks like a
mix between birth and rock stay on the
Naked 2 color and it is gorgeous
the pigmen when it comes to the shimmer
is amazing
and I applied this with the eCos tool
eyeshadow brush so I'm applying this to
the middle of my eyelid exciting shimmer
coulis look gorgeous when it comes to
the center of your eyelid and I'm also
blending it with the dark brown from the
outside
finally I have been applying a color
that looks exactly like foxy from The
Naked 2 palette a nice going on the
inner corner of my eye to brighten up
the inner part and I am also focusing on
getting the color on the Kanye of my eye
I think that's how you pronounce it and
and I also do a once-over with
everything and redo the colors and blend
them all together just to finish off the
look
next is instant brow by benefit I really
do not know what to say about this
product it is great as a product but
you're using one and the pencil will
already be blunt which causes it to
sharpen it and you'll basically use it
all up in no time at all and it cost
fifteen pounds which isn't cheap the
amount you get out of it
now onto three stages of lips first I
use a Lucia Santa slip scoop that I got
for the Christmas edition basically a
sugar in it and you put it on your lips
and it gets rid of all the dead skin and
the idea is to leave them nice and
moisturize although the goods taste
disgusting and that is the finished
result of the lips next you go on some
if your lip boots which is a lovely
lovely pink color and you I'm just going
to apply that all over my lips for extra
moisturization and protectiveness over
the winter and then I have one or two
choices I can either use a la vieille
glam shine lip stain and I got sent to
me by la vieille so thank you so much
for that I love them or I can use a Mac
Viva Glam lipstick by Nicki Minaj and it
looks like that I'm pretty sure his
brother Nick Minaj and that's the color
of it yes it's prime Nicki Minaj a nice
new color at the low l1s can sell that a
similar color support the sake of this
video I'm going to go off the map one so
just apply that all over my lips and
what I found with MAC lipsticks is that
you have to wear lip balm underneath it
otherwise it goes wrong but to that it's
a completed look but I gotta take the
headband off and now it's a completed
look so thank you guys so much for
watching I don't get some email and that
is a close-up on it I love you guys so
much please don't forget to subscribe
and enjoy this blooper
