I haven't done it in a while because the
Uploads on this channel have not been very consistent
and that is just because video ideas kept falling through people kept cancelling when I wanted to film with them and stuff so I
Need to rely more on myself because deliveries just kept not coming as well
So I need to better plan my videos in the future also
My background has changed it used to be my drawers, and now it's the back of my bed
um I
redesigned my room basically so if you do want to see how that went down you can take a trip to my vlogging channel I
Legit like upload on that channel multiple times a week as well if you want to get to know me a bit more. I guess
This video is going to be my favorite songs of the minute
I do always post my favorite songs of the minute on my snapchat Instagram
So if you do want to be like kept in the loop and stuff if the songs I'm listening to do you follow me on
There I have self promoted so much. We're probably only a minute into the video. I apologize it just keeps coming out
It's like a habit
Oh, and I feel like my glasses are reflecting so I'm gonna take them off and now I can't see shit
There's some throwbacks. There's some new ones you might have heard of some of them. You might not have done
They're not all recent ones some of them are quite old but
I don't care, music doesn't have an expiry date
You know I'm gonna start more upbeat and then go on to write more chill music towards the end just your legs start to wind
down and relax kind of thing
This is a very new one rock star. I love it. There's so many books trying to get to my room
I've been in the hills fuckin superstars feeling like a pop star
Getting bad bitches jumpin it'll pull the nang. I don't know bro. I'm pretty sure you'll know least one, but I love it
You look her didn't, but I love it, and it's definitely throwback this one's more of a new onyx knife
I love enough oh by the way these songs are not PG scissor for warning, so enjoy. Oh just as a forewarning
I am gonna have to mime and like sing along to these songs and stuff because if I don't I will be playing the song
in silence
Yeah
Yeah, that's that one that is like my current favorite song like number one song. I absolutely look at the minute
This is it. This is like new ish not very new, but it kind of is, but it's just I love it
Okay, let's go
Kali
Jai Cole's gotta come in Nashua
Jayco definitely does not believe in censorship YouTube take know well
So going with the chill vibe still this is what my favorite songs of all time like I've loved this song for probably like
Six months now, I think yeah
You see right back
Hey
Do I have your hand, please
Cold you don't really love me very much. No don't know you've known me very much can
I please have a subway for tea so I fit it all up for last week over there for
Three always last week and switching it all up for her and then
It got worked for two years and it worked again, I tried and tried to try to get it to sink in and it wouldn't
So I went on to a chat thing with Fitbit
It's not two weeks - it'll sit down by yourself coz I'm still tied up with it
Yeah, this one is very upbeat and quite a throwback to the track
I just pull up and play two whole songs, and then I can randomly she'll talk outside
Why is it or not turns out?
I wasn't even recording so
We do if you want to see more of these videos where I share my favorite song to the moment with you
This short skips video a thumbs up so I can look at the light to dislike ratio and figure out whether you want me to
Do more of these or not?
BRB Plains by Jeremiah a good old classic
I
Think this to throw back
My son
I don't know this
Was custom me these bitches with my sons, but they daddy a
Spectacle whenever Nicki Minaj has a verse everyone just like homes Nicki Minaj like adult
me
My parents has changed a little bit because it's the next day
I was editing the video
And I realized that I missed out a ton of songs or like a few songs so here
I am again, and we're gonna play the songs that I miss
Remember show I mean now my
Yeah, yeah
There's a cute story to how I found this song someone hacked into my Spotify account like full-on hacked into it and
For a while we were using it at the same time, but like I couldn't be bothered change my password
so it was my fault and
We were like using my account at the same time and I could play the song and then all of a sudden their song would
Come on, so the kept playing rick ross and this song on repeat
And it was the most frustrating thing ever but i've got to give it to him
He did have good taste when it came to this song
Is amazing
Now let's move away from the base and go something quite like hard Drake
You will offend this one. I think
I think like a chill Samba
Between us, I love this song
Get inside once you ride it bullshit CBS is old, Russia leave me at Milos
Okay alright
Everyone my camera is about to break because I'm getting
Temperature warnings on it because it's very sunny and these their cameras heating up a lot, so I'm gonna end the video here
Hope you got some new song recommendations from this video merch is coming soon die with memories and not dreams
So yeah as I said before if you do want more song recommendations, hit me up on snapchat Instagram
