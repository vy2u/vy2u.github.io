trying to get the camera settings right
so I hope the lighting is okay that the
quality is decent I have just broken my
50 millimeter lens so I'm fast the
standard lens for a few days until I buy
another one so I hope that won't be too
much of an issue and oh my god guys I
just hit 50,000 subscribers wow thank
you so much
50,000 subscribers signal we're halfway
to a hundred thousand is just absolutely
crazy I can't even imagine him reaching
100,000 it just seems like so far away
like something you can envision but that
doesn't actually happen and 50,000 is
just a number that I can't even picture
in my head I realized to the day that I
haven't been a hole in around six to
eight months and you guys seem to really
like old videos so I thought it was time
I did another one and I remembered that
I went shopping around a week ago and
then it's all over back there and I
bought quite a few things and I want to
share with you so hopefully pick up
inspiration on some makeup products you
might want to buy okay so I would start
off with a kind of stray make a product
that I bought kind of randomly and it is
this NARS creamy concealer I went to New
York a few years ago and I bought this
and it was absolutely amazing for
brightening under my eyes because I have
it in the shade of vanilla and it's ever
so slightly lighter than my skin tone so
it's a great brightener and the way it
goes on is amazing it doesn't crease at
all for me the only thing is if I have a
little bit of dryness or my eyes then it
will definitely accentuate that so just
make sure that you have moisture eyes
under eyes before applying this
otherwise it will accentuate your diskin
I have wanted a one-car lipstick for the
longest time the thing is the color or
shade of the lipstick if extremely
similar to my lip color well this isn't
obviously my lip color a webbing around
lipstick right now but my natural lip
color is extremely similar to this so I
just feel like it conceals and
imperfections on my lips and makes them
all one color and just accentuates them
a bit more
than making them a different color
completely but I'm okay with that you
don't think that I'm a bit frustrated by
is that they are like the exact same
shade they're going to go on to a
bronzer now so I was at Mike and I
wanted some bronzer because I wanted to
improve my contour skills I have a
contour today though so I look like a
potato I really like this bronzer
however the there's an NYC smooth skin
silly bronzer which is like three pounds
and I used like one on each cheek and
the application was identical letting
pigmentation and everything so if you
want a dupe for the bronzing powder by
Mac NYC smooth skin sunny bronzer i also
bought four lipsticks and i don't
usually get that many at one time so i
got this one called amorous which is
definitely one with purple and brown
tones to it it's kind of a mixture
between the two but it's absolutely
gorgeous on another one i got was a
limited edition one it was one of the
viva glands and it was Viva Glam one of
my friend Molly had to be to climb on
and she falls for picture like with her
wearing it and she looked absolutely
stunning and I was like what lipstick is
that it's kind of a dark vampire red
looking color and I thought it was
absolutely
it was really nice and it's a usual red
color but there's something about it
which is different which I really liked
it doesn't blend in with other red
colors and I got taupe as well all the
other lipsticks I research I watched my
lipstick collections on YouTube I
watched so many videos and and then I
was like I want this Brown I went there
and they didn't have it I think it was
in stone or something like that brown
that I wanted but then this sold out so
she said well topes next to her once I
was just like you know what I'm gonna
live life on the edge let's get it
without even testing it so I got it
I think it's pretty good however is
extremely similar to whirl but you see
the one that I got so I'm gonna move on
to world because this is my absolute
favorite lipstick at the moment I've got
it on now as well well it's one that
were on now so this is more or less a
pure brown color
it looks like a very dark shade of rose
gold if that makes any sense I'm so bad
at describing lipsticks and but this is
really really good the way it goes onto
your lips so well and it's different to
all the other matte lipsticks because it
doesn't accentuate the creases in your
lips it just glides on top of them and
kind of conceals them and also Oh
something else from the limited edition
thing and I got this part a while ago or
around a month or so ago and I got some
big bushes so they had two limited
edition kit sat with 45 pounds each and
I couldn't decide between two so what
you do and you can't decide between Mac
products you buy them both so these like
stipple bushes and I have this is a
stipple brush here and then I think this
is like a this is like a mini stipple
for show this one I use for mine I will
use for my foundation but I haven't used
Miette because the white on top and I
don't want to turn my key yellow for my
foundation so um I guess this one is for
a concealer and then I have a powder
brush this one here which looks really
really good for blending and then a
foundation brush should we try and don't
tend to use foundation bushes too much
so I give that to my mom I have a below
fluffy friend blending brush and and
then two eyeshadow bushes and then it's
an angled brush here which I will
probably use for my eyebrows at some
point I hope you enjoyed this mini haul
the video might end up being quite long
so I apologize if it does I really hope
that you liked this video please give it
a thumbs up if you did and thank you so
much again 50,000 subscribers you guys
are absolutely amazing I love you so
much
so thank you have a beautiful day and
don't get stay positive and my bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
