basically what this tag is is we just
follow yoga bunch of well-known makes
like Mack Nick's benneferre and may
bleed and things like that
and finally products but most like like
regardless of like the price and things
like that and just put him into a huge
list and then tell you the total of it
at the end so I'll go first
and Holly everyone first I had a look at
benefit so I'm gonna fit this is this
new thing and it's like a customized kit
so you customize your own kit I put lots
of different things it's actually really
good and that cost 62 pounds so that'd
be my number one thing and then the
second thing was benefit blush brush so
it's just like a really good brush and
then that's 22 pounds fifth day and then
benefit Beauty bag that and that's like
a makeup bag that's twenty two pounds
fifty as well which I think about the
bags better than the ambush I don't know
whether well the same price and benefit
little love potions that's twenty nine
pounds fifty it's like a huge set and
includes professional air which goes up
your paws eye cream high-beam positing
stayed on strayed what's up bud girl
lashes that girl hoola and some lip
gloss sounds everything I had one from
benefit most of all even I'd probably
won everything and then from Mac you got
extreme dimension laugh lash mascara
that was eighteen pounds and he got Mac
tinted lip gloss which is fourteen
pounds
pink poodle lip glass glass the gloss
and 14 pounds studio finish concealer 15
pounds mineralized moisture foundation
27 pounds and then from NYX the it's
blissed
and that's basically huge second
best-selling lip glosses that they have
that's 22 pounds and then you've got the
Jumbo eye pencils which are like really
they can small they're 5 pounds you can
get all those different
girly pink Black Label lipstick that was
four pounds who next that's really go to
it was half price also normal price to
say pounds and then you got stay matte
