with mama again she wants to be in
another video soon begging me to be in a
video of like two weeks so not my mom
doesn't really know what we do in this
video she knows that she's going to be
doing my makeup but it's a special kind
of makeup that you're going to be doing
you know what Instagram is vaguely
vaguely well this is kind of like a
beauty trend on Instagram where the
makeups a little bit over the top or
very dramatic so I've got some pictures
that I want you to recreate easy
foundation bit don't ya know not much
okay so basically she's screwed but
there's going to be a good video so
Jules very folks that were makeup
cleanse moisture at all their bushes all
right
victory if you use complexion pretty
primers bread alright why me yeah keep
still active a rather free just wash my
hair forget the job yeah it's definitely
blended right that's that bit done
what's that
it's an applicator want no she's crying
here not really really stresses me out
how are you using the Beauty Blender
like really stresses me out
right that's not how it's supposed to be
done you talk a bit a bit of Inge is why
the twist to protecting so we can see it
properly on the camera I never know like
it's not long distance eyesight so bad I
never know like how clear it is okay
cinemas console but no let's go on to
something called contour okay look for a
dark liquid okay now I need to do that
don't know Brenda loves on as well now
it's not contour is yes this is the same
one bill you know
feeling confident in what you doing
absolutely really doesn't realize your
confidence just kind of showing everyone
we look like I just missed some Brown
off oh my god no you're off use a lot uh
look at me for this
so Long's got finery mole so just me
Chilean looking like this I can already
tell us where I'm very wrong just in
places you put the contour is just
slightly off subscribe for the Saints
also final good looks lending
cheeky bit of evil tools and this is on
a powder blush nice and blended yeah no
it's better okay great
just realized I missed a bit chin up
chin up in both senses because we're not
happy to see the eye looks can be
recreated absolutely home and I can't do
that I'm going to get you the product
use because you stress me out when
you're to them and then you can mix
start on the earth I look sweet groaning
with first gold lace
happy with it so far
no no no aah
and we've been using a little bit closer
going in with the eyeliner yep so now I
liner before no you were quite a
dramatic way except feels halfway up my
eyelid okay so you're going to blow
again new technique I like it
is it perfect yeah absolutely birth
great I need some under liner okay
Oh straighten up great half-closed
that's a new one yeah how do I go about
doing that but a half close your eyes
yeah interesting method eyebrow okay
what is this it's called the Anastasia
dip brow pomade we're going to see the
eyebrows look that you re creating yes
why are you doing rainbow brows on me
it's good you do okay now the next thing
you're going to do is lipstick I'm going
to go for fade through like an ombre
effect okay but you've got to over line
the lips so we can look bigger than the
other and Instagram trend
it's mythical in the middle it's going
to fade out to a purple when you're
going in for the matte lipstick in the
shade well perfect yes so what brush do
you use to apply highlight mom the one
that is like a son hey well doing this
it's always putting it to all just the
whole forehead okay where the contour
goes all of that went doesn't highlight
got it that's the question going with a
Milani baked blush I can taste it wow
I'm not feeling the blending here I
don't think that is any blending and the
eyebrows as well like wow but definitely
something the contour would have
actually been too bad if you hadn't
bought highlight and then some blush
again oh it's a new look it's a new look
on it you right okay I rate it good 7.5
anyway well you love it yeah oh yeah Wow
I think if you're looking for me quarter
to the on style you know like highlight
on top of console because you're lined
up so definitely give her a call you
know yeah anyway I hope you guys did

watching give that subscribe button a
cheeky press and thumbs up and leave
