today's video first of all sorry for the
lighting the second of all sorry for the
hair I was out and it was raining and my
hair's just I've given up with it a lot
of you have been requesting a part two
to the first video I did where I showed
you my favorite song so I'm going to do
that again these songs aren't
necessarily like new a lot of them will
be quite a few years old but songs don't
have an expiry date so we can just don't
have a nice little listen to them by the
way some you might find my actions and
lexing along cringy but if I don't sing
along in mine I'm going to literally
have to be like this the whole video and
that is way more cringes although I have
sired a flow channel I have five logs
uploaded I will be blogging some more
but if you are interested in vlogs and
getting to know me then be sure to click
on that link in the description that was
so cringy I'm never doing that again
my wife Big Sean what a throwback
love him this one is timeless and Ruby
with that one you want a chill song I
feel like this is the definition of it
especially if you like sunbathing on the
beach
q and just to see you lose control
reworking 101 to Michigan old one I
don't the gold one
ah this one is creased by Drake I don't
know the limits but I just I will there
I absolutely
this one so underrated lovely so what I
will bounce back as well but you'll
probably have already heard of that one
feet a long
is the one who wants to achieve your
goals and you love songs to relate to
moments for life is a song to listen to
what Olympus Amenia alive my religion
couldn't save me
it may have to be administrative history
that one region is having a big
syndicated owner which like tsunami of
every Queen needs copier why would you
call what difficult there we go I don't
know boy it's less crab you like you
from
bit of a change how to say 21 Savage is
our Watson interview and you never seem
to watch any 21 Savage interview and
just is just no emotions no emotion
what is musics great nice upbeat song
Trey Songz Nicki Minaj
yeah they all been made some time listen
to it a minute so hopefully enjoy this
video if you did smash a thumbs up

videos like this and I will see my next
video I guess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
