shopping
two nights ago online at me stylist and
things kind of Alpine vines are buying a
lot more than us or I don't know one is
a pair of boots and one thing led to
another and Here I am now doing a
massive shopping mall I don't want to
ask if you're not but I do want to make
it quick act like announcer and I opened
a pail box so excited about it so
probably they are finally open one if
you do want to send me anything
electrical inspection anything like that
send it to this agenda here I am the
likely to point up every letter jewelry
anything me go sent upon my wall
every single things going for my world
I'm really kind loves I am as sort of an
announcement in that okay because you
want to show you is this jacket it's a
simple bomber jacket it was in sale and
I kind of wonder jackets I'm talking a
wild get it yes a solid jacket its plain
black you know like the classical style
but I'll cry like the inside since I can
miss public blue blue in chameleon
looking at color there is a names list
cause can't remember what it is and also
the harder I love it and if you want
ultimate protection from the rain and
this one's a way to go or how big it is
so legit that is how big it is how did
what it looks like on is kind of one of
those fashion hoods and that you have to
like to sit on your head like that I
always look suited with hoods on DM I
feel really professional with this that
was 20 pounds espousal it was a 220
pounds just a simple throw on bomber
jacket or some ID - original trainers
because I really liked the little white
car key but I haven't come yet
obviously because do Sunday and they
don't deliver on Sundays but this is
what they don't like anyway just pretend
to have them in physical form next thing
I bought was biggest knee-high boots I
love climbing items I have some already
and I got some fruit on something and I
just don't like them first of all the
the heels like a really chunky heel
which only look good for daytime work
and weather when I was going out at
night and also if you top it it has time
thing really - I thought they will not
put down they slip down which one within
10 seconds of wearing them and then you
pull back off another pencil
can you fall back down it's really
annoying about these I was time to marry
me last night and I put them on and I
was like we'll see if they actually
split down and again I'll also pretty
good review from these so far they were
40 pounds and it they never got with
this summer camp and silky smooth top
with a feathered hem that you can tie to
make it tighter and it's kind of crops
if one of those kind of box style tops
are likely to perfect height at your
head just goes down just sits on your
hips so they really got 12 is like any
kind of jeans high-waisted especially
and a lot of these tops that I bought
were quite basic and I don't I just need
some basic all the tops I've got about
about like of course Outback divides
we've got like a hole in the shoulders
and either got like a separated neck and
I throw through the day I just need
eight tops just this plain simple top up
and just throw on so I got this white
rib
long-sleeved top just a casual little
white pink top and that was that was on
the 8 ounce it's just a simple basic top
this one I really like I was gray I'm
obsessive grey always have been always
will be
it's got kind of like tire swings so you
put it on you wrap them around like that
you basically tired sleeve against your
wrist and it just makes you look it's
all fitted I just really really really
like the look of it oh this that was 9
pounds I think a lot of what I got was
in the sale because I was caught in
Ceylon right yes by that by that slider
and next thing that I got was this khaki
green dress and obsesses cocky the
moment I was a little bit late on the
fashion trend but I really really like
this and it's a bodycon dress styles
like body con bit risque cobalt we is
going to a White House put on an extra
like 50 pounds so you know what I did
getting prepared are you ready for the
fact that I got this
I kind of feel like a mole I don't know
how many sorry you want to get one of
these but I feel like you would quite
necessary
I got a shapewear
short basically it just sucks in you
stormed so I mean and bodycon dress is
nothing at all it's fine if I don't eat
anything and put them on or my stomach
it's just when I eat something I have a
really big problem where to get below to
the instantly and I must
expunged like five times I was I was
talking about this is curse 1503 she's
my best friend and I was like I feel
like when I go out to eat I don't even
get a smooth baby I feel to get like a a
standard adult it's that bad so these
are here to miscarry the food at 15
pounds that dress and the shapewear was
10 pounds as well I remember the price
of us next thing I got was very wintry
but it is so so comfortable it's this
camel cropped long sleeves high neck and
jumper and it's got the hem as well as
chemical ragged hem and so the outside
of the I thought it looked really good
in the wintertime with some white
high-waisted jeans but not only that the
inside is all just whoop yer wall I saw
so cozy okay next thing jeans I got
these jeans delight legging jeans
jeggings noodles make them and they are
these high waist fits like thinner waist
editing that vanilla extra high waisted
jeans they got down the aisle rips I've
been whipped into the on putamen teens
and I ever really were but they're just
so so kind of tells us they are really
really stretchy they have a court of
ankles well I love chol to handle they
were 35 pounds which I feel like it's be
surprised with a peachy light pink
colored basic white top with a single
pocket just to throw on or black simple
pair routines again and then basic
t-shirts were ten pounds this one was
also 10 pounds but this one is just the
same style of future the same basic one
pocket t-shirt but it is in black this
one I got quite a while ago it's like a
bralette to wear when I go out and it's
a kind of burgundy style classical world
edge
I feel like dramas always look classic
you know we should mineral they should
look trashy I still AM II always look
classy
I especially if you wear my jeans or
leggings that's all I are wearing with
anyway essentially that I'm going to
dress again black eyelet detail ties
shift dress so it's just a dress that
just goes down to just above the knee
and it's got these like eyelet pocket
filler or fake pockets I will never
understand
pockets why use making real pockets and
make them useful and I also bought this
camel jumper cool colored jumper with
some little holes at the front now not
the point of them is but I'm going to
choose tutorial because I really like
the back because me back is I don't know
what you'd call it an eternity stress
smart which I really like the other
problem is anybody else seeing that bra
through this back and I'm not going to
wear a stick-on bra
I refused to wear them I wore it once
and I don't get it it's don't stick they
don't work I've you said look sweating
in LA she's not a very good invention I
think that's everything
it's crew sworn I bought more than that
today I did I bought like sighs more
clothing items button an accident
license something else that I bought was
this sport style dress I put it on and I
hated it it went down into like mine
this car and I'm not liking men ashore
I'm about five foot six I'm just walking
on it a little different like I was
wearing like a oversized poncho that is
everything for this video I really hope
that you enjoyed it absolutely looks
clear my shopping haul videos now my
favorite thing to do is not haven't done
one in like a year I just love doing
them and I love watching them as well
like to get inspiration from oh it's all
shorten or misguided I'll look at polls
on YouTube to stop what you're doing
then hi hello hopefully you can
subscribe in this around and give us
thumbs up and leave a comment
yeah anyway as done of talking that's it
for me have a peaceful day and live life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
