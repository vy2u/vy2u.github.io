caught I don't bloody know what they are
but they look really really cool I'm
gonna go with these amazing so there we
go male I've got the first outfit for
you I can't see what this one looks like
I feel like it's a bit it's something
quite different but I feel like you can
rock it so have fun with that one oh
it's just a sweat I really like this one
I actually kind of want it for myself
this any issue by really really corn
milk so there we go we're gonna sort
this one for you Millie
found this one as well they'll issue
just some like normal leggings I don't
really consume much myself but they look
kind of cool it's going well so far so
let's continue okay Millie so be brave
on this one I'm gonna go all-out so I've
got some like green only trousers with
taping so this next t-shirt right
ignore the Texas I file it really
cringey I feel like it would go well
with the thingy so I shouldn't be
messing up just fight like a girl okay
Milly could probably beat me up so I
don't know if that's a true quote I'm
excited to see if this is gonna work so
one more we're gonna make an interesting
outfit now okay we made this one very
interesting for the last outfit we're
gonna go with some stripe so we're gonna
mix it up I think this will look cool on
you meal
Massimo just bought those let me chase I
know we're gonna do this is a very
interesting we're gonna do some tailored
crop tapered trousers but I'm gonna go
with this look I know this is not you at
all Millie but it's gonna be jokes so
let's try and get these in the basket
and then I'm gonna order the oh they're
quite expensive but I think it's give me
a jokes outfit so you know this one's on
on the cards
hi again so basically I wanted to do
more clothing challenge videos but I
wanted to do one with at least one
member of the social climbers and for
the first video I wanted to do it with
Spencer I chose Spencer because he's
really into his fashion but in the
future I really want to do a video where
like social climbers choose my outfit
for an entire week to see how that goes
down I'm scared to do that because I
know they'll choose disgusting outfits
for me even if they try their best but
it'll make for a kind of a video
hopefully oh and also if you don't do
the social climates are it's kind of our
UK YouTube group or like what our
friendship group calls ourselves we call
ourselves to social climbers you can
find some things birthdays boosters
whoops yes I know but if you do want to
get to know the social climbers I kind
of what we do take a look at my vlog
channel their vlogs we just basically
get in trouble do random stuff we are
not PG whatsoever we're a really weird
friendship group but you might be into
it so take a look interesting okay I'm
into them
ah I'm not even joking if I saw this on
a sauce I would buy it like that you're
definitely watching this video right now
like oh well that's boring it's not my
fault you chose Coulson I like yeah this
is de Santa Cruz oversized sweater
if the look is oversized out of the bag
or not I think it is but then look on
the back there's your burst of color red
white and black such a good cool calm
especially for like my street wear style
this is gorgeous but it could definitely
be ruined if the bottoms that he buys me
are ugly high waisted leggings black and
again you watching this like Oh boring
of course that's not gonna look bad the
high-waisted black leggings and you're
right I'm glad about that oh my god I
was wearing these really thin leggings
through the day I get home I've been
traveling all day seen hundreds and
hundreds of people I get home see this a
massive hole in the back of it massive
is definitely an exaggeration it was
quite small but still it was like round
the bomb and I was like oh no the jumper
feels extremely soft don't get
foundation on you don't get foundation
on it
Wow I got no makeup on now one thing I
don't have that many of all like sweats
as I can just chill in so it's a nice
change you just have like a cozy little
sweater but I really really like this I
really rate it that's the back of it as
well they fit really well they're weird
material for leggings but I actually
think I like material of them the Santa
Cruz logo and then the red and white
squares down the sleeve so this is a
plain black t-shirt and knowing Spencer
he's definitely paired these with some
very interesting pants and I think these
are going to go with the green pants
that I can see unless his worst pants in
there that I just haven't seen yet cuz
I've not looked through the entire bag I
haven't made an eBay video in a while my
brother's lucky oh okay I just messaged
fence and asked what pants go with the
black top and he said the black and
yellow ones which are these they are
white fit the entire way down I think
they're 3/4 legs as well oh this is kind
of out my comfort zone but I might end
up liking it I don't really wear yellow
clothing whatsoever but I want to get
into it because so many people suit
yellow oh my god people with darker skin
that wear yellow it looks absolutely
incredible like it looks so good my skin
is quite pale though and let's have a
spray tan when it's quite pale I feel
like yellow will probably wash my skin
torn out quite a lot this tops a little
bit cheeky
it's a little bit cheeky these parts are
very white fair hmm these pants are so
comfortable these are the extreme wide
fit pants only thing is it's ever so
slightly loose
on the waist and now what we need to do
is make this outfit complementing which
means oh no it's a very long tail okay
right with this one we're gonna have to
bottle it up and tuck it into the bra it
makes for double padding it's a win-win
situation
anyway oh I just wish these were fitted
a little bit more like a bit tighter on
the weighs less relative Wow okay okay
if you can see that I've just passed on
my heels with it to make it like ever so
slightly more dressy or a lot more
dressy I really rate this with heels I
just love how freeing it feels I come
not restricted in any way I feel like
I'm floating in these oh my god I could
take some Instagram pictures in this as
well like oh okay give it up you know
what I call it and that's enough of that
Wow right now my clothing style is
definitely basic white girl with a twist
my actual brand but if I see these I can
start being edging also I'm gonna leave
the links to all these clothing items I
own package in the description box below
if any of these take your fancy okay
yeah here in the green pants and also
they to have these stripe down the side
but they have a black and red stripe
greens a color it's definitely cooler oh
and this is a top I'm learning with it
okay I like the combo well thought out
this is also from the brand only what
from a saucer it stays fight like a girl
on it I can't tell whether that's edgy
or really cringe well you know how
Topshop have you like quo t-shirts that
are supposed to be edge people to just
actually really cringe and to say stuff
like Daddy and baby girl on them they
are so ugly no friends of you on one of
those t-shirts but if you do then you
should probably throw it away well yeah
this takes fight like your girl on it
and the reason I think it'll go well is
because the green on the top matches the
green on the pants really well actually
the green pants let's go of the green
pants you've done what I kind of
expected them to do so they figure 8 on
the thighs for us for the waist cuz my
body's kind of disproportionate so I
want to try and put a bell on the see if
that fixes it at least it's got belt
loops so I'm not a third week of waist
training
but dick okay I've got the belt on and
it's a lot better
hey I don't even need a bobble with this
it's kind of already tired that's gonna
keep talking into my bra this is called
me being lazy I actually really like
this out there and I didn't think I
would but I'm extremely happy that I do
like it
I definitely wear it with heels so cuz
these jeans I just feel like need to be
worn with heels I just don't know how I
feel about that like drag them across
this and I wanted the entry person
because I don't want it to be edgy it's
just green and matches the pants not
quite complementing as well ooh this
outfit is ugly when the tops not tucked
in so yeah if an outfit is not looking
particularly nice you just got a hole in
our bin make it cropped Spencer did
message me so he caught me done Charles
as I was like oh oh I don't think he's
in and Charles is like cigarette
trousers I really like them I like my
pants to be really complementing on the
bull merrier just because you know who
doesn't and this is the back of them I
don't have them on and I already know
they are gonna make me look like that
from the Bible I just flat completely
flat gray suits me like this jumper if
you disagree please don't destroy my ego
in the comments good but just gray on
the bottoms just doesn't compliment me
oh thanks so much
well I'm definitely not returning that
this is from the organic organic I love
organic items this is from the organic
cotton section in new look I didn't even
know they had that but good for them for
being yeah just a plain stripy t-shirt
again I think I'm also gonna tie this
t-shirt or we've been talking it into
the pants but that'll look very smart
I'm in love with this I think tops are
really weird face like square we're
gonna tie this one as well okay so one
same figures last time took in extra
padding
okay these pants are cigarette style
pants again I love my cigarette trousers
so so much usually they are either
elasticated or have a tie around waist
these don't but they fit really well
like compared to the other things they
are not too bad on the waist whatsoever
and they fit really well in the leg area
and this top goes with them a lot
especially since it's cropped or like
I'm DIY
I really rate that I like these Allah so
just the camera to make it more personal
oh hello double Jim teehee Spencer you
have done an amazing job I congratulate
you so much every single outfit was a
success every single outfit was exactly
my style or something that I loved and
liked and I will literally wear all of
these daily yeah guys I'm sorry if you
wanted to see fail outfits if you do
want to see some fails and go and watch
the video where my mom chose my outfits
for a week because there were definitely
a few fails in there one of the outfits
being me wearing an elf costume our
about also guys let me know in the
comments below which one of these was
your favorite outfit so yeah that was
Spencer picking out my outfit I have no
idea how he didn't tried any of them on
but you've just seen how it went did it
go well did it no so yeah that's the end
for this video I hope you enjoyed if you
do you want to see more of me go over to
