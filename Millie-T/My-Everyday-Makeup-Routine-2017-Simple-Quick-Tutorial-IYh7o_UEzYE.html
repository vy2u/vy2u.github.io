makeup tutorial if you want to see how I
got it keep on watching
quick side no I have devised a plan I
won't be going live on you-now every
Friday we're going to what we're doing
cahoots I'll be forum guys back on
social media guessing you and opening
snapchats live everything like that so
if you wanna follow me on you now just
add my social here I asked you guys on
Twitter whether you want to see this
video or not in a poll and a lot of you
said yes so here it is and I hope that
you enjoy it only I would decide to film
makeup tutorial on the unite when I get
two hours of sleep that's great that is
wonderful so I am starting off with the
Olivia daily essentials which
moisturizing day cream now I've only
just got this I've been using it only
for a week now so what it is absolutely
amazing
I'm also going to be wearing matte
lipstick which means I need to prep my
lips for that with some chapstick so I
put that on usually at the start this
literally came in a pulse yesterday and
this is definitely going to the part my
everyday makeup tutorial routine so it's
going to be kind of first impressions as
well as I can forego an outline I use a
sponge now just not the actual Beauty
Blender it's the Real Techniques one
which has done me quite well actually
by the way I forgot to say to see
maybelline dream satin liquid foundation
I'm liking this a lot
it'll break down on my neck as well
after my foundation and move on to my
concealer I'm going to try and give as
many drugstore commendations as I can
and to those of you that don't want to
fork out a fortune on makeup which is
completely fair enough so I use the Mac
Pro Longwear concealer usually and
however for under-eye circles
something that works amazingly is a
Rimmel match perfection concealer that's
the drugstore option by the way I am so
impressed that Beauty Blender and yes
now
I just kind of paint my face with this
click legit
so the laughter that I got in I going
with powder a few are really inexpensive
powder that's really good I usually use
the collection lasting perfection powder
I it just seems to work really well and
I think it's about two pounds so that's
an absolute bargain but sorry to go all
high-end I usually use the micro Sol de
and I use this wheel techniques but now
I'm pretty sure it's a foundation brush
but it works really well in really like
pressing in your powder
by the way I was thinking of doing a
testing a Primark makeup video so you
want to see that I've done testing power
line one but I want to try out pry marks
makes no use before I am so pale in this
camera oh my god why am I so pale
ah I need it I use the Mac press powder
and like bronzing powder however a
really good alternative is the NYC Sully
bronzer it's literally one pound iodine
and if you're from the UK you can get it
from like stupid drug or even boost
switch you'll it anywhere and you can
get it in America as well definitely
you're just letting off the most part
one contour you don't really know what
I'm doing so you probably like what the
hell are you doing I don't know
whenever I contour I always just think
like you should basically put in a
border around your face and that
probably means I'm doing it wrong that
is looking really old on camera but it's
not at all I don't know why it looks so
pronounced
okay so looking for my eyebrows I just
use so many different things if I want a
really dark brown I'll go for this black
brown bar I'm looking something quite
natural I got the Anastasia brow Wiz and
then if I'm looking for like something
really bold I've go for the anastasia
dipbrow
and if I just want to fill them in a
little bit of golf theme L'Oreal and
blow artists genius kit but my everyday
makeup tutorial I use every single one
of them usually so I want to start the
Anastasia and I usually do that just to
kind of get a shape going to my eyebrows
so it creates an outline that I can then
fill in
the hell is that what the hell is
actually no one else watching
what the hell is that
then after that I going with my L'Oreal
genius baroque it
honestly if I had the effort to redo
them I would I just don't and because I
like him a little bit more doc I will go
on with the anesthesia it Brown that was
so loud I'm so proud
okay I give up moving off so next I move
on to my eyeshadow and I use a little
more of a shelf all the days that I do
um I'll just wear kind of a bronze kind
of cooler and just work it all over my
eyelid that was just the Mele beauty
eyeshadow in the shade from silver
raindrops drop talks no makeup tutorials
and it just stops because they are the
ultimate best drugstore mascara ever
if the Loreal million lashes mascara is
absolutely amazing you get the length
thickness and it separates every eyelash
and will not get like any goofiness
whatsoever it's absolutely amazing
whatever our there so I'm not happy to
show you now the hanging scar that I use
every day is the upward lash mascara by
Mac and it is absolutely incredible you
can just get so much length but before
that I curl my lashes and to do that I
use this Revlon eyelash curler
I always blink into any scar as well and
I don't know that's a good thing or a
bad thing but it's work leaf like New
Year's Eve New Year's I love the scarf
so much it makes people from an instant
like 2.3 to a 4.5 and this will scar as
well because the wand is so small it's
really really good for your bottom
lashes
I'm amazingly good this is also a new
kind of appearance in my everyday makeup
routine but it is this Revlon makeup
revolution wand an ultra brush palette
so gone for bronzed I'm gonna go for
kind of like a bronze wash to live off
less and I usually real side
step wash brush for it and also for my
highlight is not eliminated thing and I
just put it on my fingers and dab sorry
my highlighter you really pop I use a
liquid which is this NARS illuminator
with the part with a powdered highlight
because the powder that really sticks to
the liquid and then I use a stippling
brush on this Urban Decay Naked
illuminated powder like that dab it on
and just dab it on again onto my face
onto the liquid because then it sticks
onto the lips now I use the Kylie lip
kit for my lips in candy cake
such a good product in my videos I
always get asked what lip products are
wearing and every single time I'm
wearing the candy lip kit in candy k so
I'm going to pull it off
only thing Kylie lip care is that the
lip liners like the middle part like
actually comes out which is a bit
annoying that is my everyday makeup
tutorial but before you go please
subscribe if you are still watching this
video because it means that you
hopefully enjoyed it so you might like
to see more fun videos very optimistic
thinking from me but hopefully yeah that
is everything have a beautiful day and
don't forget stay positive bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
