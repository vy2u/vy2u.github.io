joined with my mom how many videos have
you been in now altogether
I want my channel three maybe four when
they guest appearance on something and
she who loves it
today's video though I'm the one that's
pretty nervous because my mom is going
to be choosing my outfits for a week or
like five days and I don't think that
you know my style very well I think you
think my Styles a lot more girly than it
actually is so if you could describe my
style in one word what would you say
shabby chic
okay no style came out I'm not doing
this video shabby chic buggy cached
outfits in leggings
okay yoga tops you came to redeeming
yourself now actually okay
that's I'm feeling kind of more
confident but not fully if you are new
to my channel make sure you stick around
by pressing the subscribe button I have
a lot more videos planned for the future
and I also do have a vlog channel if you
want to see the more personal side to me
I guess I mean if you want to see more
of this pretty face oh wow I didn't
think that was very funny I don't know
why for what to do this video I don't
know why I thought it was gonna be a
good idea cuz I've kind of shot myself
in the foot we'll just whip mom we're
gonna whip well that was a perfect you
just did your own thing that was enjoy
okay so I was looking at the parcels
that Malia gets through the door and she
bears an awful lot of stuff from pretty
little things so I thought that would be
a good place to start and so I went
chance appreciate something and I found
these superb trousers that I similar to
what I used to wear when I was younger
and I thought oh there be good because
they suit me and then I thought maybe
Millie wouldn't like him she'll probably
kill me oh I saw my chance of the other
trousers and I looked through doors in
the sales section see if I could get
something cheap and so he's lovely
pinstripe ones so I was looking at
different colors to see which color I
thought she would like the best and
decided that the pincette ones were
really versatile they're going out
absolutely anything so I went for those
and then chose a little black
top which I thought was a sexy little
number to go with them and that's get
size 12 in the bottle top they didn't
have a 10 left so I'm hoping that
that'll still fits it's quite a stretchy
material and then I really needed to get
something else so I looked a white bar
door style top and thought that was a
bit too similar to the one I just got
her so but I think something else so the
this little jumpsuit nging on with a
little frilly bottoms on the legs I
thought that my well cute I knew Millie
would absolutely hate it but I thought
it was a good excuse to try something
girly and then it's an alternative I
found though more casual like jumpsuit
so I ordered both of those so that she
would have a different style on each day
and then I went on to a sauce because
that was like doing a lot of street wear
but I know she likes and came across
this addi desktop with the big eye on
the chest so I thought well that's
really cool so I sent for that so I sent
for the leggings in grey to go with it
I'm not sure what the fashion thing is
about double grey at the moment but hey
I like it
so Millie's also talked about Jordans
shoes in the past so I thought I'd have
a look at some of those and I found
these retro ones in red and she loves
statement colors so I tried to order
those but they sold out then I find this
little pink top and I thought that was
really fantastic so I bought that one as
well and I viewed the basket and decided
I needed some ankle boots to finish off
the outfits so I was going to buy some
little Taiwan's and then decided on
somewhere stood to completely outfit and
though we are done so reduce for the
next day and it's 20 to 5 and all the
parcels have arrived and I've got my mom
to pick out my outfit for me for today
because I'm going to be going to at
McDonald's and then going to my friend
Nicholas house so I will still be going
out and about and I'm going to get
Nicola and my friend Cara who I'm going
to see now to give a review on my outfit
because they don't know that my mom has
chosen it so yeah I'm gonna go
downstairs now and see what outfit my
mom's prepared for me and I'm very
nervous
begins with E oh okay I approve of them
I think so far so good okay yeah I
absolutely love them kind of thing gave
me buildings
so that's your Footwear okay
so I have no idea what it is I'd
actually really like that I think yeah
this is something that I would
definitely wear actually you said that
you went back and bought another pair of
shoes because you saw these on your
computer that was those here okay thank
you I read this I'll go put it on anyway
to see what I think I still write it
once it's on it makes me look really bad
it's gray and it's not like I guess
sweatpant immaterial but it's not
clearly weight kind of is if I tried
this on in the store I'd probably like
cry and like take it off like 10 seconds
later so besides I have to wear this the
rest of the day here we are at my second
home once again so we're approaching
McDonald's and I just want to thank
McDonald's of having the drive-thru
option because there is no way that I'm
going in McDonald's like in this outfit
because I feel so insecure that bottom
half in this outfit I don't like it I
love how I'm like oh I'm so insecure in
this outfit I feel like it makes me look
fat and I'm like and McDonald's yes
please
okay opinions honest opinions oh I like
yeah do you actually like that sound
cover you're probably confused as to why
the cameras on basically my mom chooses
my outfit for five days and this is the
day one out she's dressing out made me
look fine I'm like it's fluffy give me a
quick brief review oh great I want a
quick five-second message to Alison send
Alison that's my mom's name send her a
message okay so he's Tuesday I haven't
finished getting ready yet because my
makeup isn't done butter
another day another outfit my mom came
into my room this morning and put down
the Alpha this she wants me to wear next
to my bed black kicking ham thrill hem
band or jump sue okay another jumper
another day another jump suit oh god
sake
oh okay so Ike's Oh a strapless like
that but it's got really frilly bottoms
here by the
really really it that is so girly this
is about Haiti okay what the hell is
this this it fit great if my boobs are a
little bit smaller but they just keep
this keep sliding down because it won't
fully go over Oh for god sake
so I'm in it eventually it's very
suffocating I'm just gonna wear it
around the house for a little bit and if
this doesn't come down too often then I
will wear it out but if it keeps coming
down I physically can't wear a tower I
don't have to call it hey cuz there's
nothing like I can't do anything with
that
okay that's slightly better actually but
he's still gonna come down oh I can't
wear this every time I raise my arms it
literally just comes down right we'll
have a look at the shoes anyway um I do
love my heeled ankle boots like this I'm
just not too sure about the stores I
think they look a tiny bit tacky like
there's a challenge and then this your
boobs coming out in public so it's just
not very practical
so in conclusion to that I'm afraid that
I cannot wear this out so today's outfit
mom was a definite fail
hello everyone is Wednesday now we'll
have it slightly where and planets have
slightly changed a little bit I'm up to
Amsterdam on Friday just for a holiday
for the weekend with communist fencer
and Jordan and my youtube friends I
don't know if you know them if you watch
my vlog channel you will but this does
not affect the challenge the challenge
is still going ahead and the clothes are
in that bag there
my mom has put all my clothes in the bag
so she should put the outfits in bags
and labeled them so this one's Thursday
so that's not today okay
Wednesday's is here green sneakers to go
along with these as well she's bought
okay oh no why shouldn't double gray
yeah and I didn't ask
tisha and then also I do - like insole
that's game back inside sports where
kind of stre Westphal that I like away
from the frills and jumpsuits that
definitely don't fit like yesterday that
was such a fail it's double grave I
think you can get away with that I'll
try it anyway okay
first issue with this outfit is that the
leggings like that comfortable for
they're not really that comfortable I
think that was a lie
because they're not high-waisted and I'm
going to crop top and I can't wear
leggings that aren't high-waisted with a
crop top like I can only wear
high-waisted things
yes face outfit was definitely a lot
worse today I'm going to be traveling so
I can definitely do with this but yeah
yeah yeah
are you done this is Spencer you
probably already know him
I'm calm you know cielito as well you
mean their name arena joy salvage agent
hammer toy yeah I know Jordan Houston
yeah so yeah let's see what outfit she's
chosen for today
no they both I'm all for commies by the
way because we're going to Amsterdam
tomorrow honestly I'm so excited and if
you do want to know what we get up to
over there Lee Grahn vlog television
this is actually really cute I like this
I think oh is it off the shoulder are
you done
go try it on Wow any time you want to
borrow it just let me know and then
these
iris chuffing she wanted me to wear
these with the ankle boots but I didn't
bring them because my like suitcase was
way to have a and so I'm gonna have to
wear them with another pair of ankle
boots that's kind of cheating sorry but
I was like literally don't have the
ankle boots because they're like weigh a
lot the really heavy and if they would
have taken up too much in my case you're
excited for Amsterdam boys
okay yeah stop it get some helmet
okay so I'm ready for the day now and
and if you'd like it's a comfortable
outfit apart from the shoes I can see
them like getting very uncomfortable in
a vet because they are really thinning
quite high the top is okay it's a little
bit like loose-fitting hair like I could
do with a bobble to like tighten it the
pants are really comfortable and they've
got like a proper adjustable right waist
as well and yeah I think I Rea although
I haven't seen the outfit fully because
commies got no full-length Mary's room
what do you think Spencer I mean it's
cool Charles's person listen calcine you
want to say a message to Alison hi
Alison get outfit we've got some place
to eat cold Hemingway's there's
something funny and the elk are you do
you mind the app it's actually really
comfy ball I rate it a lot I think is my
favorite outfit so we've come to a
really nice little hideout area so I've
just realized that this outfit is
basically overdressed for every occasion
you know how in the last clip I said
that I'm overdressed or I feel
overdressed we are going to a Porsche
garage to just look at the cars and see
what the like so I'm definitely dressed
the occasion at least I feel like I am
anyways so I feel like I'm dressed
appropriately so that's good yeah you
okay hey everyone so I'm going to
Amsterdam today it is Friday
my mom has still picked and alpha is the
final outfit and this one it is just a
t-shirt I haven't opened it up yet
because it is still folded but Angie put
it in the bag and basically said I can
pair this t-shirt with any bottoms that
I like I think it's pretty sure it's
like a crop top or something like that
so I think this outfits gonna be quite a
nice one because I'm really hoping that
it is comfortable because I'm traveling
today so
whose scratchy or anything I'm gonna
feel it on the plane oh oh oh it's an
Ivy Park once the thing I'd be parks
Beyonce's collection with Topshop
okay I don't mind that how cropped is it
it seems cropped ish okay I'm gonna pair
that with my night Pro leggings I think
and then obviously the green shoes still
so yeah let's get change into them so
I'm just changing to the top now all I
like isn't usually a color that I'd go
for but I don't mind it I've just these
are the night Pro like inside put it
with it's not like extremely cropped
it's like a slight crop but it hangs
down as well which I really like it's
really nice if it actually and mom you
did well with that I'm happy with that
along with the shoes as well that I've
gone but you've already seen those so
yeah it's a traveling day now I think
I'm just gonna end Friday here because
like the comfort of a table you don't
really care about because like it's a
table is fine it's not gonna be scratchy
or anything so yeah that was my outfit
floor today it was kind of ever DIY one
apart from the t-shirt stole my mom kind
of cheated a bit today which is a little
bit annoying and leave a comment below
let me know what your favorite outfit is
from what day and yeah you'll be another
video next week I'm already started
filming it unless I upload them the
other way around
I'm not too sure so bye everyone to the
