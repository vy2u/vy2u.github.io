hear she sat on the city the difference
between Milly being sat on the settee
and maybe it's just on the set C is that

early in the morning depending on how
you want to look at it

know all inside trying to play off
completely cool in the vlog life
thinking that they can microphone won't
pick it up so she just carries on and

all-important question is where is the
chicken Kiev I'm still after that I'm
going to bow obviously as lessor I was
just doing that I can't believe that she

job as well like I'm not gonna lie she
