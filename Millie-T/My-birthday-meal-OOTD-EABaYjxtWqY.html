for a meal tonight yep another meal and
but it's also at my outfit of the day
video because I just threw this outfit
on and I actually do like it so came out
with a good result so I'll go through it
in detail now this is a t-shirt it's
kind of a crop top but I've pulled my
leggings up a bit so you can't really
see my belly I suppose I need them a bit
further down so it'd be a kind of like
that so you're not really seeing a lot
but yeah it says awesome kasa fun and I
think still these I'm in a bit so I
haven't worn in a while but I'll just
iron it in a minute but yeah it's a nice
crop top you can do girls short dips
down lips pucker up and go short again
but I do like yeah and it's not really
it's not so props if people to call you
and anything like Swati or anything like
that but it's I really like this I need
to actually wear it a lot more often so
these are the leggings I've got on and
they look really boring but actually if
I turn to the side
there's frankly all down the sides the
only problem is that you kinda have to
keep twisting them so they stay at the
size so they don't go to the front
let me look some real stupid but yeah I
actually do you like them they're not
boring leggings suppose they don't go
with every outfit so if you've got a
sparkle top then they don't really go
but yep album so now I have sparkly
shoes as well but they're not real
sparkly but this kind sparkling so yeah
these are the shoes and the kind of shoe
boots shoulder pad boots put shoes at
the same time so yeah they've got heels
on them but they're not heels like
you'll break your neck in still quite
high but you can't really tell you look
really sure on here but they are quite
high um but yeah I think anyone could
walk in them and now that's what I
wasn't about with glitter kind of
they've got all stops here and then if
you turn around same with you the shoe
and to get them on you just sipping Oh
unzip them and then check them again so
yeah the really simple to get on and
these are from new look these shoes for
25 pounds the leggings were from new
look as well no they're leggings with
from Topshop and they were tempeh
eight pounds a pound and this top was
from generation new look from I'm sorry
four flashes in them I don't think
headed I just have to edit it out before
it but yeah Nick not sure how much it
was cuz it's about a year old now but
yeah it's not gonna fit me for much
longer I don't think but you actually
pull these things out of it okay maybe
not that much and yeah so right now but
yeah um and now I'm going to like my
face and home like my earrings as well
so well that is magic and but yeah I had
my eyebrows done with the benefit care
think it's called like the sing eyebrows
or something but I already done by that
and then I had my eyelashes done with
L'Oreal million lashes mascara that's
actually really good
it's about eight pounds a mascara she
would have what do you call this mascara
a an item like single individual and
actually no it comes with an eyeliner
but yeah it's eight pounds and I've got
benefit and god I'm really bad with
names
I'm not sure what they what it's called
it's like stay flawless foundation and
then I have nothing on my lips I might
put some lip balm like Vaseline on it or
something but and then that's it so now
onto my hair so yeah I have my hair
bleached and every weekend so I'm just
gonna taking that right now and
highlighted by mister Wawa yep she's a
great person so I'm just looking out the
window cuz there's a nice cat sitting on
the window sill so yeah whew I smell
sausages whoa I just want to see what
they are and onto my hand I've had my
hair highlighted with the wrong muscle
and be blonde kit as you can see here
and also for my earrings I just have my
originals and seconds done here and then
when it gets to over here needs to
secure that bit erm oops I've got a
chain that starts with my originals and
goes up just above my helix
because about my helix piece it's well
there and then I've got a bowl hanging
off for that one but you don't need to
have your ESPs to have that one on top
of the chain as well
I've also straightened my hair with some
ghd's and if I turn around you'll see
that I've secured my hair with some
bobby pins but I don't need to do school
