three fancy outfits ok so this one is
really fancy but it kinda made a
selection fear jumpsuit placing
whichever you like to call it first
really hot day I think this is a really
good combination doesn't have to be
specific with this outfit but just a
tight up and some quite short shots
because say if you are really hot you
can carry the top really high if you are
quite cold you could just tell you it
really low at the bottom um so that is
why the tight ups convenient I always
keep it somewhere in the middle love and
and with the shorts and I always find
that these are kind of the not short but
they're not short sharp and they're not
long
they're in the middle so like you don't
go out feeling really cold or really hot
you'll be in the middle so this is the
combination I think a work best along
with a pair of ballet flats or pumps or
flip-flops or sandals whatever the
weather is like so thank you for
watching please don't forget to
subscribe because I am uploading a lot
of videos each day now because I've got
mine to it so yeah please don't forget
to subscribe please don't forget to Like
and please don't forget to comment any
