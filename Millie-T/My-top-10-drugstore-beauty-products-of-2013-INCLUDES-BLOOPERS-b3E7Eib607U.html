video starts the winner of the giveaway
was Jessie love
she wasn't because I did it on random
dog and she her name came up so
congratulations and if you were curious
and that's you want but stay subscribed
because I will be doing a giveaway video
and at the start of 2014 for like a me
is giveaway
so let's gonna start with the video
category I'm going to go to his eyes
because I want you so let's the first
product I have is Rimmel scandaleyes
samskara as you probably noticed out on
my products are my favorite sir Rimmel
blast because they're just a little bit
so much so if I show you the brush of
this one looks like this and I love this
because it just goes onto your eyes it
doesn't clump your eyelashes together
and it gets two really really small
eyelashes right there that I really hard
to get so that is why I love this
product the next product is lovey L
million lashes mascara George my videos
regularly you'll know that I am
absolutely obsessed with this product
because it's just they really separate
your eyelashes and they all work great
for your bottom eyelashes as well
because normally with really thick
mascara so you just clump your eyes
eyelashes together but this one keeps
them far apart so I'll show you this one
it's kind of faded because I used it so
much but it is after 2014 so I've got
about eight of these so that's not very
clever is it and the bush is light so
are they they used to ah my favorite
I was Skylar's products so is lips so
first of all I have elf lip gloss now
this is kind of American but I've been
American shopping a lot so I've got like
gos I can't find a lot in UK but I did
get some from selfish yourself and and
I've got elf and I've got a few Mac
which is hard to find in the UK as well
so what I find with elf the problem is
that the package janae
always fade so it looks like an
unbranded cheap makeup well it is kind
of cheap makeup but it's still good so
it's have the name elf on this wipe it
here and if we turn it around you'll see
that there is no alpha and
it's faded and that is not fair so but
this one film still upside it does a lot
and this one adds the color to them I'll
stop plump them and it really tingles
your lips that makes them feel really
fresh so I really really like that so
that sees my next lip product from ELF
part is called plumping lip glaze as
well so the next one is a lip scrub now
this is a really it's a drugstore but
some of the jokes tub is that high-end
it's just kind of a store but it sells
makeup in as well so it's lush but will
gum lips go butts like that now and this
might sound really bad but with us I
just feel like the like fun kind of sits
on your lips and it doesn't really do
you really do much dessert suffer my
lips it does when it's on when it fades
just completely and start some being
soft but this is absolutely brilliant if
you don't know what lush is
and it's basically a store that sells
bath bombs mainland it has loads of
random stuff when you go in there you go
in there and you have asthma you will
need to take an inhaler because it
really doesn't do well for your ass
because I used to have it and every time
I went in there I just got the smell was
disgusting
well it's actually nice smell but it
wasn't good for me so if I open it up
I'll show you what it looks like and
it's actually quite weird but look this
is what it looks like inside oh my god
is not focusing well of course okay I
got something going just really nice
there are loads of different flavors you
can get for this well not Lord there's a
bubble gum absolutely amazing
mint julep absolutely amazing that some
mint and then you've got a seasonal one
they bring out this needs an extender
and it is absolutely disgusting the
taste it's like a really dry taste like
flour and with flour with a hint of
lemon and there it is
the discus thing it's not a nice smell a
taste do smell nice either to be honest
so thanks one it's not nice and then
until 2 a pup called one and popcorn
that scoop does not go well I really
don't prank that one comment if you have
any of these and lip scrubs or not if
the do lotion American up but if you are
comment if you have one of these and
what your favorite flavors are which one
you don't like some really curious to
find out this is my favorite bubble gum
next is a massive pipe this year all
across the world and you'll probably
guess what it is when I say lip balms
and it is I'm dropping them all
Baby Lips okay yes I know I have quite a
few baby lips I have more than this
actually yeah it's not really good but I
I have every flavor and that's all I
really wanted to get so I have peach
kissed intense care cherry pie this is
joining me this is the first one I got
it's really nice mints second one I got
em pink punch another peach kiss and a
hydrate one and my favorite I don't
actually know it's probably the mint
coming
why
stop falling out of my hand
you nearly fell again Baby Lips so this
is a mint one and this is my favorite
because tastes like mint a lot tastes
really nice goes onto your lips really
smoothly and it smells exactly like mint
and it's pulling the stronger smell of
the month so baby lips massive hype this
year and they are just absolutely
amazing and if you want them for just
fall in color then you've got the mint
one the plum
can you hear me dropping them I don't
know if you can if you can't I'm just
gonna like a widow but I keep dropping
them tonight so you just went for color
and sent things like that then the best
ones are mint peach kiss cherry me Pete
pink punch and I have a mother
peach kiss
I really can't help
I really need to learn how to hold
things so I'm just going to drop this
one just for fun
wasn't that fun huh can't do it again me
except laughing it okay so the best ones
if you want it for care and actual
medical medical medical reasons are
intents cares you can tell by the name
and hi Draya this one looks better this
one is better for your lips so baby lips
a massive trend this season and they are
absolutely amazing
and the packaging is so nice I didn't
like it at first but I got used to and
its really nice next I'm going to talk
about face products because if I had to
choose any type of makeup I like it's
definitely definitely face products
because they are just amazing and if you
have really nice mascara eye shadow
blush and well eyeshadow mascara
eyebrows and lips but horrible skin then
they'll be no point in putting the
makeup on because skin is a person the
person notices it's been so the first
thing is collection lasting perfection
ultimate wear powder this one is so
cheap it's about 4 pounds and which is
about 4 for 4 dollars 20 in America or
euros 6 about photos four-year-old's 20
as well I'm not really sure but it just
opened it up and I've used that a lot
and it still hasn't gone down but I use
a lot at time so that's actually really
impressive and it stays on all day for
16 hour wear and that's actually true
which not only this one is next
I have Rimmel stay matte powder
long-lasting pressed powder Padre
compact they're my multi fiance longer
delay yeah do you like my accent okay so
this is by me Mel as well and I slid
ones from collection for the song morale
what I like about Rimmel products is a
and kind of em carve their sign onto the
product understand that's really nice
extra bit added to it and did you oh
right I need to show you this next
I'm not happy I just drop everything why
I haven't got bad grip say it's cracking
your knuckles II bunker grip but yeah I
don't care
listen habit it's a happy now so next
it's Rimmel again wake me up foundation
which is this now this is quite popular
right now and Rimmel in ASDA we're doing
a everything under five pounds sale so I
was like right this was not only ten
pounds but because they were doing that
everything under five pounds it was four
pounds ninety-nine obviously it's one of
the best products it has product so they
had to put it quite expensive or not
expensive but and the highest it can be
further under five pounds so I really
really cheap as I did the pressed powder
so I bought these two together and they
came to a cost of about ten pounds
together so that is really good when
normally it would have cost me about 20
pounds for them both really nice thing
for face is 17 bronze cream blush which
is this here now if I open it up it
looks like this I don't know it looks
like when you put it on your cheeks you
cheeks will be like dark brown your face
will be pale but it's not like that it
when you blend it together kind of
blends for you skin tone just highlights
to cheek cheeks a lot and I think that
looks really really nice and I really
like that
next I have number 7 Polly now I don't
know if that really counts or not but
you know I'm going to use anyway cuz
it's a product I'd say so if I open it
up I've used quite a lot of it already I
got it and about May this year so it's
already used but it is of 2014 so 2013 I
mean so if I open it up like this you've
got all the eye shadows here then here
you have lip glosses like that you have
a magical layer Oh magic and here you
have your powders and you blend these
two if you have a lighter skin tone and
here I have brush blushes so we've got
lots of different colors here I like
this one the most because it just I
prefer highlight in my cheeks rather
than colouring them so that it's an
seven pallet I really hope but that was
ten products I don't actually know if it
was I know that I had more than one
product to the baby lips but that was
just sitting sample probably my favorite
product out of all of them is Rimmel
wake me up foundation one moment wait
here it is
and this is a new ones had already got
it which was about how I know it was ten
pounds before I it's just an absolutely
amazing product so you need to buy it
thank you for watching this video so
much please don't forget to subscribe
comment anything or which put your
favorite product is or anything like
that and I will talk to you soon goodbye
to millions goodbye
you can laugh at the bleep is now part
yeah so the next product I have is lush
fresh handmade cause met cosmetics I
think it means that but we'll go
hi-yah so just a
you can't see me on that I need to get
something to cover that out I was like
nine on that I look like an idiot but I
was with my friend she was real a nice
girl
I got sharing the picture cause it's
just weird so so this is my tip I'm
hoping that in they've got a kind of oil
it's a scent fresh fluffy towels and
every 99p from home bargains and I think
I've burnt it that much the smell is
gone I need to put the lids on the mall
bar because I know I set fire to my own
room this morning because I'll lighten
them and then the match broke in half
half and creates friction and then
that's what says it on fire against a
side of the packaging because yeah like
wait wait witty bit so I did that and I
removed it really quick along here hold
it really quick him along it and then it
lit and then the match snapped in half
and the other went on my floor but then
I am but I don't actually know what I
did I just kind of go on the floor that
way before I had time to set a floor on
fire so yeah well this story don't snap
your match in half
alright that's being edited up again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
