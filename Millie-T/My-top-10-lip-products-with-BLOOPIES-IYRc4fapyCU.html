lip gloss part on the lipsticks part
then I will have the link here if you
want to fast-forward to be in my top 5
lip glosses so I'm going to start off
with some American makeup so I went
online shopping when I had my debit card
annex items first thing I bought were
for lipstick and they are the colors of
the mall these two are quite similar and
then these two are quite similar but I
just really like the colors of them all
because they look good and then also if
I just open one up then this one is 6/10
celebrate it's really good just kind of
red color but I also love how firm the
end tip of it is and it just feels it's
really good to have a cure say so I like
these
next I have the l'oreal glumly shine
like lip crayons you kind of him with a
monkey lips and they sing your lips for
ages like ours and they are really nice
so I got one in red one in orange and
then one in a nude pink
next I have L'Oreal lipsticks I have
these in the color 3-6 7-5 deep
raspberry and for all to electric
fuchsia and this is C 375 gorgeous color
I am really do love this color deep kind
of raspberry color next I have to
remember docks and these are not 260 I
missed I missed
shimmer and 200 latina and the 200 of
you knows like a really light pink color
that's really nice
it's like coral color it's not really
bright pink it's just a nice coral color
and then these this this one here is a
kind of dark pink but it's gorgeous and
I love it and finally for the lipsticks
I have my Mac ones Viva Glam and the
original ones and in the regional one I
have sent Jemaine a 73 and and it's a
really light pink and I just love light
pink especially ones like this
and it's a bit darker than how you can
steer it's a lot darker I think what I
really love the smell of MAC lipsticks
although the Viva Glam smells a bit
different it smells like more perfume
words that one smells more sweet it's
like really nice nude pink it just feels
really perfumed okay now we're on to all
the pages so first I need lip glosses I
have the ultra plush lip glosses by
benefit so these are all these here that
I have and I have one full size one
which is a kind of orange color
that's really nice and then all the
other ones came in a set next I have
four Rimmel lip glosses two for my
friend and then two of them I bought
with my money and these are all the
colours of them and you've got a this
one is called 190 pinup these two this
one is called a 130 take a chance and
then this one is called 330s no next I
have a item that I think is discontinued
but it's from Avon and it is a sparkle
lip gloss and it's kind of that cool if
you want to see it up close and personal
is he cooler as a whole and all that
would save like look behind me I get
ready so in the color book and I don't
extend to orange look and that's how the
call it looks like so that's why I don't
do that
next I have the elf um kind of plumping
lip gloss only problem I found was this
it's because is that the names come up
it's oh no it looks like unbranded
makeup and not a bad thing but you know
I just I I'd prefer it with a name elf
on it so ain't still really good looks
it does plump your lips really well and
it makes your lips and tingle and like
the EOS lip balm does and if you've if
you know I mean by tingle like tingles
your lips and finally I have three Mac
lip glosses and well I have them on
three but I've got three my hand right
now and I know just wanna I've got these
two because I just wanted to tell you a
story
and but first of all I'll just tell you
what this is and this is pale violet
that's the color of it and then these
are both creamy pink and what I did
these are these two are the same color
accidentally because when I basically
did was I bought
well actually I bought this one from
Selfridges and it cost me another price
of a mac lipglass
and I really like the color and then I
went back to Selfridges for a darker
shade because I wanted to try duck shade
and I think they packaged it up the
wrong one for me
and I got the same color again but
they're both still really good lip
glosses so it's all good
