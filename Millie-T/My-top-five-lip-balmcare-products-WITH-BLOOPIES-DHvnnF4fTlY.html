be very short but it is my top five M
lip care products of all time really so
let's get started first of all you
didn't already see like a little clip
before and the first product is the
Maybelline Baby Lips and these are my
two favorite as this videos are quite
specific but I do have the full
collection of them apart from the doctor
ones and the electric ones because I
live in the UK I'm kind of okay you
should kind of please call always fight
excite me only wanna go because they
look amazing but these two are my
favorite ones because they are intense
care and hydrates and these two just
really do work best for your lips so
that's where these two are and boy in
the Baby Lips collection by the way next
and is some lip scoops by a lush
santer's lip scrub you will have seen
these and a lot of my videos and that's
because I just look them so much and it
just completely soften your lips next is
it's a OS a-l-s these weird egg-shaped -
lip balms up are still really cool and
and the first one I have is mint it
smells really really nice smells like
something that reminds me of my
childhood like Janome Liam shelter my
cat remember wat and it tastes good okay
that's a good way to stop eautiful from
using it just look here and then no one
will use it but do not get a spoon and
eat this because that's not gonna go
down well with your stomach and then I
also have the strawberry one which I not
too keen a smell on but it does work
with moisturizing your lips I've heard
that you always have SPF in them and
please comment below whether did they do
or not because I'm really confused I
want to know I will sell them cuz I
wanted stole I mean here next are the
marionette but haru's I've got the
raspberry rose and the original I really
love these because they obviously
moisturize your lips so much dansgame
you and moisturize and dry out your lips
oh you
and then bang the one of the products
they just completely moisturize your
lips which gets you to buy more their
products anyway so I don't know why all
the bond companies don't just do what
Nivea doesn't follow in their footsteps
it smells really nice and smells really
and soft not too strong at all and it's
just I've used to live here and it's
still flat so that's really good
and then finally I have the some new
year again I'm just but this time it's
just stale bombs so the first one is the
Nivea essential care lip balm i takamine
is the Olivia hydro care which is in a
blue bottle Olivia pearly shine I mean
my favorites my favorites my favorite of
all three is definitely this hydro care
one because of the packaging and two
because it's really really good for
winter this one's best was so mad and
this one is best for spring and autumn
and I also heard about the EOS lip balms
like alike aft
shut up Millie here babbling again next
I have the Olivia nip puts it
what really like the Livi oh that's it
what do you see with going to I'll
understand this lipstick melon because
we've got this really hot guy on the
bottom of it I mean look at him wow I
sure didn't taste that bad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
