say quickly before we start the video

questions of people asking if I will be
attending I'm asses here and the answer
is no unfortunately because I couldn't
get tickets in time but there's always
next year suppose and then the second
question and the second thing I want to
say is that I'm going shopping on
Tuesday too much Chester on Dale's

do it sometimes I just forget but I'll
definitely remember if you guys want to

if anyone tries to let you about it eat
them too it's right I kind of quote that

very famous actor I do still like him
our favorite color pink but if you
talking about greens and black and white
loud music or soft loud if I want to be
quick or if I'm in a hyper mood or like
yeah energetic mood and then I also like
soft music when I'm just kind of
browsing the web where do you go in your
saddle actually when I was younger I
used to have a static corner where I was
like beanbags teddy bears

whenever I was sad I used to sit in that
corner like this
I like go on the Leapster something like
that but that was just my corner and now

need
I have a bed and a YouTube I am
completely happy and food we cannot
forget food
how long did to you to shower and
actually I don't really I take a bath -
more than showers but when I do take
showers if I'm in a rush it takes me
about 20 minutes and baths take me
around hour and a half because I stock
up loads on lush bath bombs
I honestly have like five baskets full
of lush bath bombs and I just put them
into the bath and they relax me
how long's he tell you to get ready in
the morning school days past ten minutes
cuz I always have to be in a rush to be
on the weekends it takes me about an
hour to two hours and if I'm going out
somewhere and if I'm not going out
anywhere I just stay in my pajamas all
day so it takes me know minutes at all
actually it takes me about five minutes
because I got a bush but not about six
minutes whether I've got a brush my
teeth and pee and then I'm good to go

proper physical thigh and then another
time it will call if I it was in year

America um and it was with my friend
Jessica and I don't think I even touched
each other we were just going around
like I don't even know what we were
doing turn on the lights turn off the
light boots and I took joy in YouTube
the reason I joined YouTube was because
my gymnastics place that I went to close
down so I wanted to share gymnastics
with people on the internet so I started
off doing gymnastics videos and then the
amount of videos you could do which when
it came to gymnastics became very very
limited and and it was very limited so I
just simply moved on speeds videos and
there is so much stuff you can do Beauty
videos and I do like tags and things
like that my channel isn't completely
Beauty it's just like lungs tag skylight
your average panel feeis I have a fear
of needles and the dark and I don't
really interfere the dog IRA fear after
sleeping wide open in the dark what I
have to do is took my feet under the
covers like make a pocket and make a
pocket off the side of the covers and it
goes past my head like that
and then I'll kind of took this tender
look over under the club over other
cover
and they'll sleep yeah and I always have
to face a wall cuz I'm not if I'm not
facing a wall I feel like something's
gonna like when I open my eyes are gonna
be like Bloody Mary in my face something
like that yeah I'm really really weird I
am honestly so weird I sing that made
you cry the notebook I actually just
watch the notebook and it was so sad
until I cried last night why do cry last
time you said you loved someone my mommy

youtube name

with and beauty by and makeup with
makeup by so I used makeup with Miller
because M and it makes sense doesn't it
and then I my favorite number is 12 it's
like on the edge of being a teenager and
things like that sounds my favorite
number and then I just thought I don't
really I don't really want people
thinking I'm 12 when I'm not so I
changed to so I double dare and put it
to 24 it's an even number I decided to
make it stay like that then also make up
by money 24th channel and I didn't even
think anything of the names but then I
got a lot of comments I was like oh yeah

books on culture that absolutely amazing

wide range if you don't have a website

strange but you know there's also them
waterfalls and people like the waterfall
he drops down right down on the bottom
it's piled with the rocks because just
natural and because the waterfall it's
like a really still water and then when
it goes down it was blue like that
people like Oh lay on top and have their
head hanging all from the waterfall and
just left like that because he doesn't
move or anything like that and they're
not scared of anything really but anyone

anyone and today who should answer these
questions next the people that I tagged

okay I have to ask you guys question ow
my legs are burning because I just had
the laptop on and it's really hot and
okay so tags on YouTube so you do a kind
of TMI tag and you tap people in it I
don't get how that works like how to
person know you tagged them does it kind
of tell them notify them or do people
let's see in the description that
they've been tagged to go and tell them
all of the people that made the video
tell them I don't know because how do
people know that they've been tagged or
not it's just really really confusing so
please comment below and tell me how
that works so by the end of the video
