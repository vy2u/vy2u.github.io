the day it's actually really nice
weather but it's getting quite late now
so the sun's gone in but it's really
nighttime so I'm wearing this and all
this is from Hollister and I'll tell you
the prices because I know that Krylov
you'd want to know so like if this
interested in buying it themselves
oh hello Charlie and so these shorts
were 40 pounds from Hollister at night
he got simple there and this top was in
sale rack for 25 pounds so yeah 65
pounds all together there because yeah
force 5 plus 20 65 and I get 5 maths me
know I want em so and it's very rare
force to have nice weather so I'm kind
of taking advantage of it this tops off
also from Hollister I don't know if I've
said that already
and to go with that I have got this nice
little golden tray chain I don't know
where I got it because I'm gonna have a
gift of someone and but for my jewelry
I'm wearing a flowery Blake bracelet to
represent summer for once because we
don't really get somewhere in England
and and that's got like blue gems in it
so that is good for that kind of the
blue to match my shorts and the flowers
to match summer so this is my basic
outfit of the day for July the 8th 2013
just in case you didn't know the day and
yeah one's really wet though so I'm not
going to go on to the long because it's
just been them sprinkled with water but
yeah this is my outfit of the day so
thank you for watching this video and I
hope you enjoyed it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
