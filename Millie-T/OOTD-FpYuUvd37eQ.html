like it can you see girl we look but not
to Galway I mean although colors go out
together for instance I have the pink
for the hit earrings with pink shorts
the white top matches the white in the
shorts and they have a few stuff in my
pockets that kind of finish off the look
awesome
I have she boots the shots I quite like
the shorts because they're not I mean to
be honest let's be honest you see girls
around town now and the shorts the
shorts are that sure that you can see
you can see the you can see the bomb and
it's not a really pleasant sight don't
know what what goes into the head to
make them wear it shorts it doesn't
matter how short they are as long as you
can't see you bugging them that's the
main thing but the easy contacts are
reasonable once they're not too long
they're not like 1970 long and their
weight it they're reasonably sized I
mean people go off you go out with them
middle of spring and quite warm no one
will give you a wet look like it's too
cold why are you wearing that they won't
give you that one so these are some good
shots to wear and also this top it's
really convenient because it just took
Stan perfect away but not like how he'll
took it just kind of bag silver so now I
will go over the whole outfit and talk
to you where I got it from ok we'll
start with the head and work our way
down so on the head I've got these
earrings in the feather earrings and
they were from River Island and they
were 5 pounds and from America they
always will be a tiny bit more because
if you exchange occurrences they're like
that and and also for a makeup
I've got million lashes mascara
and for the lipglass I've got Rimmel I'm
not really sure what type it is what
it's called but I know it's Rimmel and
it's really good it's kind of clear but
it makes them a brighter color and now
on to the t-shirt t-shirt is from
Hollister it was really good it's
reasonable length so you can just nice
it soak it in t-shirts and it's buttons
and they've got two pockets here which
is really good also your sleeves and
they on button and button up so you can
always fold them back if they're a bit
too long so this is my top and Hollister
I got it in the sale whale actually and
it was 35 pounds in a sail rail well I
think it's on the price was about 42 so
it wasn't it's quite expensive but for
Hollister that's okay
and these shots here move it I'm using
kind of a bit further down here yep
these shots here these shots are from
H&amp;amp;M they were 12 pounds and I really
like the design of them they're like
pink black on white and they're just
like random patterns all put together
and they have really big pockets too but
they're not offer you so don't bulge out
too much I also just slipped a phone
case in here I always said had my phone
in it
but I don't have my phone on me right
now so I'll just put that there and kind
of stick it out him I just a bit of a
look to it and also got some roll-up
bubble gum also pink so put together the
top and bottoms were about well tops
well 35 think and the bottom to about 12
so it was about 42 I know not what to do
about this
and for 47 months and that would mean
well for seven pounds all together and
for these but it is really worth it and
this is really good quality material um
it's cotton I think and cutting it yeah
because and I now I've got lasting it's
my shoes I'll zoom in on my shoes so
that you can get a better look these are
my shoes and they are shoe boots if you
can train yourself and I got them from
new look they were 20 pounds which
wasn't too bad and what I really like
about them it's that here they have last
stops and the heel isn't too high it's
not like really high it's you could walk
in them you go go on a shopping trip in
them without your feet killing and they
are quite good with Jamie okay and so
they're really good the dog the
waterproof too is I've been in God knows
how many pull offs with them and they
are for that so here my shoes
this simple zip fastener and I think
I've covered everything for the shoes

not too sure so this was my outfit of
the day please don't forget to subscribe
