then like maths that don't even know

I could get a three in English and be
like fair enough then I could get like a
7 and Bill are a and be like okay I can
see that Jack don't know how they exam
when um Sciences I actually can't
remember GCSE it feels like I taught
them like months and months ago I wish
how long ago like three months ago now
vintage a lot popular than mine Spanish
I guess that entire exam I remember
seeing the exam and just being like I
have no idea but it's multiple choice oh
I just like a random box and when I tell
you that I guess I just went in or dress
like a CD a CD again and just mash you

for RS I'm nice so much and still gotta
be like the same as Spanish and I do not
understand that book whatever it's fine
