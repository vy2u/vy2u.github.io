that has changed quite a bit
basically I went to the hairdresser's I
asked for it to be cut sure they cut it
a lot shorter than I expected and they
also dyed it a lot lighter than I
expected it to be as well but I don't
actually hate it I think I prefer it to
how it was before what do you think do
you prefer it now do prefer how it was
before let me know in the comments just
don't destroy me you got too much
I wish I was joking I've also had a
spray tan and I don't really know how
the two look together cuz normally my
hair's darker than my skin and it's
really not now and I don't know how I
feel anyway um so today I'm doing an
ebay old boxing video never done an eBay
video before today's different kind of
genre cuz I'm gonna be unboxing mystery
boxes I've got quite a few here also
merch is coming out very very soon I've
never done merch in my life before so
this is my first ever merch job and I'm
so so excited for it to come out I have
worked really hard on these designs
since February so if you do want to get
your hands on the merch or anything like
that make sure you're following my
social media cuz I'm just gonna be
basically announcing on that when it's
alive and published okay this is the
first box I want to do is to write so it
looks quite interesting something that's
a bit weird about this box my eBay
account is not connected to my YouTube
whatsoever my eBay names like Milly t42
or some random number yeah the pot on
the back of this box pie Nils hope you
put this in your vid kisses
Kourt PS sorry I ran out of bubble wrap
and first of all don't worry about your
bubble wrap and second of all like I
don't know how she knew about my youtube
channel at all because it's not linked
to my eBay so that's kind of weird
however the fact that she expects us to
be in a video makes me think that it
might actually be quite a good mystery
box oh okay oh okay
first thing is this pick-and-mix colour
mixable non permanent hair color silver
it's also definitely been used because
that's how much of its left so that's a
interesting second thing oh okay
I actually kind of like this soap &amp;amp;
Glory hand food this is hand
moisturizing cream and I really like
this and I've been through about three
bottles of these songs it's not poisoned
it's okay for me I read that I really
like the soap &amp;amp; Glory hand cream as well
like a lot and this is gosh I've heard
of these gosh prime minster primer and
mattifying setting powder by the way if
you haven't guessed already this mystery
box was like old women's beauty box so
yeah that's what we're unboxing at the
minute gosh primer set primer and
mattifying the setting powder has this
being used putting that hand cream on
wasn't a good idea except I can't get
the lid off okay yeah not a chance
I tried also to decide whether I get my
money's worth or not the total contents
in this box should I look to over 20
pounds which I say this is probably like
5 pounds I think would you say I'm
pretty sure the contents in this box is
gonna be over 20 pounds but the only
thing is a lot of these to secondhand
and already have been used so I don't
know if that really counts it's a full
price and if that's getting your money
back no doubt in the listing they did
stay like oh some of these are
secondhand so it's your own fault if you
get them and then you disappointed by
their being secondhand things in there
well we'll just have a look and see okay
alright okay so she's spinning me out is
so bad because I wanted one of these for
so long and it's so random
it's a fidget cube I don't even ever
seen one of them but it's like a cube
that you can just mess with I'd
literally pay twenty pounds for this
anyway so this box is incredible
Courtney well done Wow the fidget cube
name is pretty self-explanatory but
basically it just has different things
you can fidget with so it has like a
joystick thing here here it has like a
rolling marble ball some like rolling
things here it's got a switch Wow and
it's got its own case as well
wow wow wow I hop make up some of the
love triple baked bronzer
oh okay so this is a knockoff or like a
dupe for the Too Faced Brunswick's is
that the same packaging and stuff Oh
they've got more hot food cool Wow this
is perfect because I love the hand cream
from soap &amp;amp; Glory and I've got another
one here as well
this one doesn't look like it's been
used either a bubble that's cute that's
cute check it that would have been
perfect if I was still in high school I
think it's still a quite cute though but
I don't even think I can get my hair up
anymore I've not even tried to get it up
joke I could okay so that's Toby sure my
hair still does go up into a bubble doll
which I'm happy about
it's just a very short bubble boss you
go boss oh wow okay
body lotion I don't know how good it is
his actual body lotion though I always
feel like perfumed things just never
really do the job they're just they're
like effect and look nice kind of like
pretty girls with no personality you
know what I am so impressed with this
mystery box
I literally paid twenty pounds for this
and the things that are in it are
amazing Toni &amp;amp; Guy radiating tropical
oil natural shine and softness and I
don't know what you'd do with this oh it
tames frizz for a soft feel and adds
natural shine this is where it goes
wrong it this just makes my hair greasy
I'm gonna be so annoyed I don't really
know what that's done oh no laughs oil
on my hands Oh cute also I don't really
think I'll be using this because I
always have acrylics on like as you can
tell I justify each other toenails and I
hate that word toenail I don't know I
don't know this is a mini CR take nail
polish and it's like a shiny one it's
got blue and silver like flakes in it if
you can see that that's so cute Wow oh
my god okay so before the body shop as
well body butter this is incredible for
a mystery box like this is worth so much
more than 20 pounds now oh that smells
so good and it's brand new as well like
hasn't been used whatsoever it's all
about the little flick of cream to show
that it's new if you have any idea what
I'm talking about
time filler always a wrinkle correction
cream and don't think I'll be needing
this for another like ten years and over
hopefully anyway
Torchwood I can give it to my mom I feel
like that was kind of meetin at the same
time technically true because I almost
have wrinkles especially in mind she
scales at me all the time okay this is a
Yankee Candle as well Egyptian mosque
this is so random what's so good like
we've gone from a frigid cube to a
Yankee Candle and I
a little bit oh I can smell it that's
what's really good actually I don't
really use
I don't really tend to use candles that
much one because I would probably burn
the house down and I don't trust myself
secondly the dates of me being a BTech
2012 YouTube beauty guru are well and
truly over so I no longer need candles
for my morning and night routine videos
and thirdly I just there a lot of effort
basically and the final thing in this
box oh this is a nother CRT nail polish
and this is kind this is the nail polish
version of the dress it's just literally
a silver nail polish but it's so nice I
love glitter at the minute because my
dress for when I went to the shard was
like glitter white glitter so overall
like obviously that box was absolutely
incredible I am so so impressed but at
the same time I'm a little bit
suspicious because I'll be set on the
box she was like hopefully put this in a
video so I feel like she knew about my
youtube somehow and if that's the case
that I feel like the box will have been
packed a little bit unfairly and a bit
biased and a bit nice because she wanted
a good review in a video so that you
guys have gone by the mystery box as
well maybe I don't know or maybe the
mystery box is in general are all this
good but then again how would she profit
out of it because it's these are like
too good okay so that would've gone to
one that I don't think it's good because
you know when you order a mystery box
you know you think you're gonna get a
mystery box and then I got this I still
have no idea what cynics I can't tell
but would you can unbox it but it
doesn't look very good
the card says and the benefits of
Himalayan Souls purifies the air
improves mood increases performance
increases energy levels
I'm confused am I supposed to set fire
to this am I supposed to rub it on my
body am I supposed to eat it if it just
if it is like just salt in there and you
can do whatever you want with it that's
quite good
I'm definitely rubbing on my body I
enjoy a good exfoliation session at 2018
this is my year cycle alone calendar has
a dates in it you can just
his schedule I just basically use my
iPhone calendar for everything this is
easier but this is like you I might get
dissed my grandma she just loved the
little journals see this is something
that could be like 15 pounds but could
also be like three pounds and I believe
either and then the Himalayan salt
cattle it should be 2 pounds or 6 pounds
again so I don't think I did get my
money's worth because obviously they
were able to profit off it that way okay
zedd box or z box the mystery box made
for geeks
so this one is from Funko and costs
twenty four pounds it says it has value
of thirty pounds and over inside that's
not that much profit like if you pay
twenty four pounds and gets thirty
pounds and over like you usually like oh
you pay eighty pounds but you've got 500
pounds with the stuff in there it does
look very legitimate boxes from a proper
company like on the front here it says
record share love just youtuber things
and this is very foreign to me The
Hobbit stickers there's gonna be people
watching this video that are really into
this stuff and they're gonna absolutely
hate me I'm sorry I'm just act like and
this is all foreign to me I don't really
watch a lot of films and stuff the hair
guys literally seeping into my brain I
just don't know what any of this is
holographic card pack maybe oh I don't
know this is a this is not my forte Lord
of the Rings of color change glass oh
wow science it's a glass and I think it
changes color oh it's not that changes
color the writing here I think I got if
you saw that change whoa
so this is like there's like recipes in
this it like gives you recipes for
different burgers but I think it's a
joke it's a it's a job but I don't think
it is this is a collectible I think it's
a little bubbler head you know those
things are just like it looks like that
again this is really not my forte I like
I think I got this box just to have
quite a bit variety but it's quite cool
anyway I guess vs rip spin warriors
Superman what oh you mean you're making
fire
looks like the head spins around baby
people leave their head to post space
thing because that like spins around it
shows it on the box I've just
decapitated him I don't know and you got
a poster but I don't know what the
poster is either
I'm so sorry I just don't know what any
of that stuff is because I'm not really
into it now this box is an interesting
oh if you want to say it's fragile on it
and I want to know what right dial in
there literally only just opened a
mystery looks like and maybe some
bottles
oh wow this is packed what Cup pack that
is can you see first thing we've got Mon
you in moisturizer revitalizing
moisturizer is this perfumed no oh it's
not used as well it's all sealed up oh
wow wow wow I'm going to hello world
this weekend I'm going to set off to go
there and literally like an hour so I'm
gonna pack this in my bag it's shampoo
and body oil but it's all in a different
language it's in Greek detangles shower
brush
oh this is their slogan the wet brush
squirts Wow okay oh cool this is
toothpaste but it looks like quite fancy
toothpaste whitening mint
Marvis should we taste it YUM mmm YUM it
tastes like those xxx tres strongmen so
if you know what I mean also I paid
about 20 pounds of his box as well I've
already got my money's worth I'm pretty
sure and oh what's this oh wow there's
three things in here in here oh so
you've got exfoliating shampoo
thickening conditioner and scalp
revitalizer this is so good for this
weekend as well excel literally just
have to pack them and I've got my
haircare sorted out as well I don't have
to carry like massive bottles of shampoo
and conditioner and instant foaming
cleanser Oh skin cleanser amazing this
looks like proper stuff as well it
doesn't look cheap and what a Google how
much it is guys expensive stuff it seems
this thing alone is seven pounds fifty
so like it is good stuff and I've
definitely got my money's worth
why is this video
success I can't clickbait eval from vine
expert compliments antioxidant oh wow
