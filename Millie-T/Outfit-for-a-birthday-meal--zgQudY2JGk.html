grandma's birthday no I think she's
about 84 now but anyway this is the
dress that I'm wearing I'll show the
shoes in a minute and the dress is a
bull funny great better I'll show you
that now so this is how far if I need is
oh I'm not wearing fake time it's just
the lighting and because I can't bring
my lights into the bathroom but like oh
my
so like the lights that light up the
whole camera bow so yeah the lighting is
a very good of my legs just a little
funny and then also I have this brown
belt it's quite nice this also it
doesn't have a limit or how tight and
fasten it because you're threaded
through that kind of cluttered material
it is and this is a material from a
dress it's like cotton and it's really
nice so anyway enough of the dress let's
get on to the shoes so these are shoes
and I got them from a shop called garage
and it's like it's actually really
expensive there but they're quite fancy
shoes anyway so here are the shoes quite
the very glitz Niblett kind of diamond
dick but like down to a girl's best
friend even they're not proper diversity
resemble them so to go with a dress I've
also painted my toenails a pimple that
stock the dress but still works I've
also painted my fingernails pink so with
this look I decided to do my hair and
just straighten it so that's how damn
head is straight and my hair is quite
long it's about up to here if you kind
of put on a bed so it's about two here
um and I've had my highlights done as
well and just like kind of goes with the
outfit you can watch me get on the
highlights too and I said well that's
not my channel already uploaded um so
yeah and then I've done my eyebrows with
the benefits and with the benefit yeah
not sure what the name is quite remember
what the name is but it's like an
eyebrow kit they don't haven't many
there
so you'll probably be able to find it
and also got low yeah million lashes
some mascara on
I'm some mua makeup academy and I should
have one and then that's about it didn't
put any foundation on because I didn't
really want to just let my face breathe
a bit so yeah um this is my outfit the
dress the shoes the hair and the makeup
so thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
