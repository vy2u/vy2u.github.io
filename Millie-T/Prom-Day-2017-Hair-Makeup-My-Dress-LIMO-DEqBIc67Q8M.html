if it's prom awning prom date I do need
to UM get my makeup done right now I've
kind of done it myself but obviously
I've got to get it promised ID so that
means dramatic eyes dramatic everything
I don't know what I'm going to get yet
but I will
so the longest time I haven't been that
excited for prom but today I'm getting a
little bit excited I don't know I don't
want to get that excited - difference as
bad as that sounds but hopefully prom
beats my expectations and like I started
watering so I'm just in the car now
getting ready to go to the place get my
makeup done and I'm excited I've never
had my makeup professionally done before
so this is something new for me and I
really don't know what to get like do I
get a cut crease do I go for a dramatic
smoky eye drag or subtle and like a bold
lip I know that I'm not going to go for
bold but because lipstick won't last six
hours because that's when promise proms
in like six hours but I am ready to get
my makeup done we are heading to the
place I'm stood around the back of the
selim that I went to and I've which has
just gone to the wrong place to get my
makeup done I think right I've not even
come to the wrong place I came to the
place it was stated on the Facebook page
like the dress on the page and it's not
that a dress because a woman that's
doing my makeup has moved someone's butt
a primer lined up updated the Facebook
profile so I'm like 25 minutes 20 25
minutes away from where she's actually
working and I'm late for my appointment
now as it is anyways I'm like 15 minutes
late already accepting might talk to
people try and find out where she is now
and she's probably not even going to be
able to fit me in any more tops to the
one I'm really tight time schedule so I
don't know what to do so I start dad
dropped me off and he's drove off now
and I can't get hold of him on his phone
he wandering through so I'm going to try
my best to get hold of him and see if
she can hopefully fit me in by even then
it's 25 minutes oh so foster alien
alright so a minor gains contact with my
stepdad by getting my month to ring him
so he's on his way back now not best
pleased obviously so we're going to
drive down there and I talked to the
woman who's doing my makeup as well and
she said that she can fit me in and
still like still go down so I'm going to
make the drive down we'll say I'm
getting my makeup done
hopefully nothing goes wrong this time
right my makeup it's all done as you can
see I really don't know what I did with
the clips that I feel whether I put
music over the top of them or wha I
don't know what to do with them at the
minute I'll figure it out later
I really do like my makeup but it's
weird to look at because like I'm fully
transformed and I never usually fully
transform myself with Michael I do love
it like I close my eyes like that I have
more detailed pictures of my prom makeup
on my Instagram if you want to see it
there and then also on my Twitter I'll
be posting pictures so if you want to
hit me up on there I'll plug most you
get the plug in there so well then go
and follow me on those and you can see
those pictures hi home now as Stewart my
stepdad was in a bit of a bad mood for
having to drive me around the place
trying to find the right studios to get
my makeup done and so I wasn't confident
enough to ask for a subway so instead
I've gone for some scrambled eggs and if
you know me and I've been watching my
channel for a while all my vlogs even
you know that I like food a lot and that
is healthy for me I was thinking without
that alway I'm like I'm going to be
blowing my prom dress with that and I
was like you know what I kind of fancy
dogs pepper so yeah I'm going to blow to
it but it's going to be worth it cuz
Spock pepper is the best fizzy drink to
exist apart from diet coke because
that's like really refreshing that's
completely off topic and irrelevant
because now I need to get really prone
because I don't have that much time I've
got like two hours to do my hair and one
and a half hours like altogether and
that's including doing my hair so erm
yeah I'm a bit tight on time but we're
going to make it do it I'm always rushed
I've learned to adapt evolution we will
get through this so I'm going to go coma
hello and stop talking to the camera
right now it's now code the reason you
didn't see me kill my house because one
you probably didn't care about it and -
I went live on Instagram did like you
get ready with me I'm going
on Instagram a lot more now and I
absolutely love it but every time I go
live I make it onto the top live section
which is amazing but you get a lot of
weird comments would you like open boobs
like what does that even mean that even
English don't think so but thanks for
your comment anyway love that so now is
possibly the moment you've been waiting
for
I don't really know it depends what you
click from this blog for but I'm going
to get in into my prom dress so it's a
prom dress revealed thing and yeah I'm
going to get into that getting to the
shoes love them however they are
impossible to walk in know I can walk in
them they just are extremely painful and
won't last long so I'm gonna have to
bring two different pairs of shoes in my
bag yeah I'm going to stop talking now
I'm going to the dress so I'm all of the
prom dress I'll show you it's fully soon
but I need to go to mother now for
submit jewelry to see she's got any
Queen little jewelry things items
bangles bracelets anything like that
I have hoop earrings in the ideal for
prom what we're gonna have to work with
it I've just curl my hair and I
literally left it be and I just need
some bracelets now I'm wearing this gold
ring now I have mixed silver and gold
jewelry which is a big no-no back on
resist this ring is so gorgeous and it
fits all purple is well it was my mom's
eighteenth birthday present
didn't want to go for two more jewel
she's whipped out another jewelry box
how many do you have
Lord this is my prom dress vs full
reveal I went for a two-piece mainly
because after prom I can wear this top
with like some black elasticated shorts
something amazing like an actual outfit
so I don't waste my money and and I had
it also put it perfectly at the bottom I
do really like it I love to pieces and
oh I love the back as well in the back
so I didn't see it's like a corset we
can't close that about yep I just cross
that style and goes on quite an extra
belt there as well I really do like it
and I knew the truth honesty and odd or
the only problem is that they are
absolute pain to walk in not sure I'll
be able to walk in them too low so
that's why I need to pack some extra
shoes but yes I really like
we are in the limo or we were in the
limo now we know but I'm going to show
you the limo from the outside and then
from the inside as well it's so cool I
love it I'm so probably got transport so
I'll show you it now here is the limo
sorry I'm going to increase the base and
I'm fine I'm good
won't arise from a role here now are you
ready yellows dad we are all ready we
are to time my favorite time of the day
we're going around this is only the
start so we have cutting I didn't have
all of it got drinks okay always sound
like this time you fear for birthday and
you're looking stunning hey hey rocking
the gold dress I'm on look stunning
enjoying the food people don't even on
Phyllis
so as well as our table we have
obviously got everyone else in the egg
going around heavy Ola and the main
dancer yeah I want to done something ha
so I won extra pudding yeah I'll be
playing yes so it all worked out the end
this is my kicker this is my dessert
well sticky toffee pudding for the win
am I right or am i right
all right yep I approve them they were
actually really good because we
converted from Castle to us tonight
today that feels very low
and pre-clear ask you some phone because
my blog camera died during prom I
literally should have expected that I'd
like hadn't charged my battery in so
long but I currently feel like one of
those memes you know the ones like
wayside app start the night versus the
end of the night I know you'll yeah I
feel like I'm at the end of the night
point right now like why is my hair it's
quite depressing all she spent so much
time I - you can address and I'm gonna
have to rip it off and that's the end
right apparently my BFS piercer I mean I
said for people to go out like how to
drink some people can say boys like my
human head language if only people find
out that my listen so you get that you
respectfully acquire the stairs
not go away
I really didn't record much after prom
at all and here's why so after prom was
being held at a house party and everyone
was having a great time until this girl
who wasn't invited decided to come to
the house with some questionable friends
and also thought that it would be a good
idea to pour a drink over another girl
and then stay in the house so that would
have stopped to the night and meant that
I couldn't record so we all decided to
go to McDonald's a group would have
found ourselves at Hammond Donald as
well honestly I like my see are
absolutely killing as well I didn't
really love much I didn't really have
blood watch but at the party did you and
some stuff happen that meant that it
wasn't really a good idea reaches lodge
and so we made my Donald two golden
arches I listened I had my Gorillapod
which they wanted us all know when I had
one large Diet Coke I'm such a letdown
why outside now it looks awesome company
outside and I see by Malala is going my
way home the way I wish I was going
great because I wanna move on a lot on
the whole arena for one I'm pretty sure
this is our taxi going to get in and go
home I'm still ready for bed my feet
kill what it's a walk you got walk Bob
we try wearing heels all night I feel so
bad because I've just got into my dog
which it thinks this morning and he was
not in front of his ball waiting to be
said his breakfast
it is five o'clock right now so he'll
like actually be waiting like two hours
but I feel so bad
if so stresses me out but I have to fill
with my phone because the quote is just
terrible compared to my proper camera
okay I'm back home now and I've never
filmed at this time of morning and the
lighting is really oddest I really blue
I don't like it and anyway I'm trying to
be quiet because people are obviously
like asleep I'm kind of annoyed with how
much I've logged I know for prom I think
I've looked quite a bit but it was the
after prom and I didn't love a lot of
I'm misery sir so basically people that
weren't invited to the house party came
to the house party I also didn't vlog
much at McDonald's and asticus we met
people that were talking to and stuff
that didn't know one that I did YouTube
syphilis and I was like hi guys were
here at McDonald's you would have been a
bit like oh okay hi this is actually the
first time I've done a vlog style on my
main channel and so yeah leave a thumbs
