video for you my last one was over a
month ago so I think I'm going to do the
monthly and every like few weeks now so
if you do have any questions for me just
leave them in the comment section before
below and I will more and less to answer
all of them first one it's from Hannah
burrows and it seems would you rather
have cocktail sticks under your toenails
and kick a wall Oh jump in a pool of
lemon juice coming in paper cuts right
okay I definitely jump in a pool of
lemon juice covered in paper cuz good I
think just had the thought of having a
cocktail stick on my toe and then kick
it out or it'll probably hurt more but
in different places like the pain would
be spread out a bit more well than all
focused in one place then just look
nicer now I'll just slide this in as
well and she said what did you use to
edit before you got a Mac before I got a
Mac I edited using Windows Live Movie
Maker it was an alright editor although
I've got kind of bored of it cuz I could
really be adventurous with my editing
Abby Brown she comments on every single
one of my videos yeah you can have
subscribers out watching videos and
thumbs up your videos and like stuff
like that and like fury videos and
that's great I appreciate that so much
but then you can teach other subscribers
that are just amazing and they comment
on every single one of your videos and
it's always a really really nice
heartfelt comment and Abby Brown is one
of them thanks Ryder Trauma Jordan
Denise I think and it says would you
rather have millions of subscribers who
never took notes of your videos or a
couple of thousand hour obsessed with
your channel this is a really really
good question actually and I'm not just
saying this like so I don't sound
selfish or anything I'm just but I
honestly love a couple of thousand two
that are obsessed my channel it's Riyad
a million subscribers I never took most
of my videos then liminal point do need
to just like this no point in doing
YouTube if no one ever watches your
videos because the whole reason you love
the videos who so people can watch them
so anyway to answer your questions in
play definitely a couple of thousand
that are obsessed on my channel because
that's just that's great absolutely
great I have like thousands of comments
on my videos if they obsess with it so
I'm settling for that one Zoo cannot eat
pickles
there's a great name said would you do a
meet-up yes I would do a meet-up but
Elwha for my analytics which is
basically like an overview of my channel
who are watching my videos
what percentage of male and female all
that kind of thing and they all say that
like 8% of my viewers are from the USA
and only small percentage are watching
my videos are actually from the UK so if
I were to do a meet-up to get like even
a reasonable amount of people there it'd
have to be in London and I live about
two hours away from London as well
every cannon said would you rather than
the Alpha dates or zoella Thanks I
father beat both of them but if I was to
choose one definitely is Olo because I
just feel like I can relate to her a bit
more than our faith but they're just
still both great youtubers Carlo Jones
said what's your favorite Christmas
movie my Christmas movie has and always
will be elf elf was just absolutely
hilarious everything about it it just is
some Christmas films to kind of watch
and you don't really get that much into
the Christmas spirit but elf is like the
way to get into the Christmas spirit
Will Ferrell just nine man my one pillow
three said are you American I can't tell
from your accent or English I'm English
ling-su Millicent hashtag Alex from
Target or hashtag dick qualms from
staples

know they haven't been there done that
bye-bye but Daquan from Staples like yes

go from duquon from Staples I mean he is
hot like did I nail it I think I nailed
it

my baby so just putting out there here
Rebecca aunt Christie Welshman said when
will you quit YouTube and I don't really
know I think I want it say that I'll
continue to do it until I'm like 80 but
I think when you get past like 30 people
kinda don't become as interested in your
videos unless you I'm really really
a skilled at makeup and everything and
it depends also with you when I get to
university how like busy I get and how
much work after doing stuff like that
you guys talk to me with these names
look yeah yeah yeah it could face in
Macomb or said why did you we decided to
post videos I need you I have not got a
clue like honestly I was just youtubers
and they're like okay so basically I was
being bullied at school and I really
wanted to Michael without my anger and
pain but I just
none of that stuff really happened to me
I don't really know why I started
YouTube just one day I decided that I
were gonna suppress record on a camera
and start doing a tutorial on how to do
the splits other video ended up being
about half an hour long this is no
question but I was just done the very
happy about was coming you're one of my
favorite youtubers or you're one of my
favorite people babe Laurel Rose asked
how old are you I'm 14 years of age
young but not dumb pretty a nice name
said what's your favorite makeup Brendon
why okay so my favorite makeup brand is
Mac and I'm sorry i'm really i want to
say high-end in drugstore now I know
that is very expensive or favorite in
terms of pigmentation and how good the
actual products are the quality of them
