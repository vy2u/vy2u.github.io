nails done today so I'm pretty happy
about that today's video is going to be
a Q&amp;amp;A video I haven't done one of these
in I'm tempted to say a year no
exaggeration I remember it being a
Christmas themed one and as you can see
here it's Christmas again so it must
have been a year anyway I'm getting
snapchats through from a lot of people
so I'm going to open some of them and
answer everyone's questions that they
might have me also I will be doing Q&amp;amp;A a
lot in the future so if you would like
to send me any questions when I asked
for them on snapchat send me here I'll
have these my snapchat name they're long
with my Instagram so if you want to send
me any questions do so on them social
media sites my phone screen is pretty
cracked ahead it's not in the best
condition so you're going to have to try
and see past the cracks hello Ellie I am
drinking tea remnants lemon and green
tea seeing as I'm drinking tea I was
wondering what teas you like yeah what
is do you like I will sometimes have it
but I just have like making the tea you
know the tea back to you that you put in
a tea bag and I will say I dream that
about once every three months over the
nice diet coke and water and juice my
favorite thing about Christmas and this
is gonna sound so cliche I really and
this is my genuine like what I like
about Christmas is like the routine and
like seeing family that day because I
don't see my family a lot
I see sections of my family every now
and again but as photos all coming
together and spending a day together
that doesn't happen a lot and I have a
really really busy Christmas day going
to ask different people's houses and I
really like that though what are your
favorite bands or single good question
and I don't like buns too much I don't
really do well with one direction JLS
like I know that was really together
anymore
but boy bands as a whole I don't really
do well with I just don't like them
usually okay and then ask for an
individual singer and I like kind of go
somewhere I like kind of trap R&amp;amp;B rap
kind of music they
rap artists so typical but I absolutely
love mm he his lines are amazing his
free styles
I'm just genius the way it comes up with
him on the spot and as for an artist
that I like that feats and a lot of
songs I like Lil Wayne because his
little raps that come on they just made
me laugh and he's just something about
his voice it is really really original
that I like because it sounds like is
constantly stone well it sounds pretty
good I'm gonna have answer some text
questions if you could pick anyone for a
day who would you be and why I could
pick anyone for a day I would be someone
in bridge so then I hope got like get on
that person's account create them at
PayPal get like 10,000 pounds and make
them send it to my PayPal and then when
I go back to be myself it like hey 10
grand out at nowhere that is great so
yeah I'd be anyone rich
I want to say that I have any Christmas
traditions like something that I want to
say that I have a specific Christmas
tradition but the whole Christmas Day is
I guess a tradition
I start off in my house my dad takes me
over to my granddad's
I see my dad's half of the family then
from there I go to my auntie's house and
we go there open presents and have
Christmas dinner there and I go back to
my house at about eleven to twelve my
cousin's girlfriend has just given birth
to a baby girl so she'll be new addition
this Christmas but I'm not complaining
about that I like babies what's your
favorite Starbucks drink I don't have a
favorite Starbucks drink I don't drink
Starbucks I think I've had a just a
milkshake out of anything there I have
had Starbucks milkshakes in the past
like once yeah I've been to Starbucks
once I had a milkshake there it wasn't
great I don't think it was anything to
like get excited about but it wasn't bad
it was just kind of a milkshake I guess
Jenna wants to know what camera I use
now I don't know whether she meant for
my snapchat story because she's attached
I'd like it clip of my snapchat story
when she asks about so I'll just answer
them both I use my iPhone five for my
snapchat story and it's bad quality can
I just get that out the way and
self-corrected it's not the best quality
and as for my youtube videos I used a
canon 700d t5 i however get the t4i
there's no difference between the t4i
t5i except an empty wallet after getting
the t5i I had an epiphany the other day
and I realized that I inspired myself to
do a YouTube channel I didn't even watch
YouTube at the time that I uploaded the
video very much I mean it wasn't really
well-known in the UK like or at my
school not a lot of people went on about
it because I started my channel about
2011 12 I didn't know that you could get
subscribers and what subscribers were I
just didn't think that anyone would view
your video the way how it was completely
different the community was completely
different when I started and I just kind
of decided to press record in the camera
and do a how to do the splits tutorial
and that was for my first channel video
and that is how military was born so
but I have a question and then didn't
say the question so that was useful
thank you Oh Kim what is your favorite
Netflix series my favorite Netflix
series is the vampire is 100%
I have watched Gossip Girl I've watched
Dexter I'm currently watching Dexter I
have watched Grey's Anatomy I'm watching
so many different shows I've watched
them all but out of all of them the
Vampire Diaries is the best so I keep
messing on my hair but Damon he's ha I
just watch it for Damon I just watch it
without sound unlike its parent theme is
it hard having a consistent video
schedule love you I love you too
and I don't know cuz I don't I just
upload whenever I want in a way like I
have gone a month without loading what
that's that's always because it's a
reason I'm not never gonna go a month
without loading without a good reason
if your high school crush asked you out
and your celebrity crush asks you out
what would you do well I don't have a
high school crush cuz I just I don't
know I just know but I used to so I'm
gonna go off what I used to do and then
subsequent our Justin Bieber obviously
it has been since 2000 unlike 10 so
anyone that saves are true hardcore fun
and has been for the past two months I
was there since 2010 it's like high
school crush Justin Bieber just gonna be
a bit tips the scales on that one I hope
you enjoyed this Q&amp;amp;A and I know and I
love doing Q&amp;amp;A is you don't get a lot of
use but I know that the music does get
is off people that genuinely like to
watch my channel so thank you thank you
so much watching this video if you're
still watching it now thank you so much
