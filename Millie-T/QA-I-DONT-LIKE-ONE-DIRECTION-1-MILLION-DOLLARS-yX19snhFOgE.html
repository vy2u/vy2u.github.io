underneath my eyebrows is slightly red
but less because I've just had them done
and waxed so my skin is slightly
irritated by it as it should be so if
you do have any more questions for me
for my future Q&amp;amp;A I try to answer as
many of them as I can so chances are
your comment will most likely appear in
my next video so if you do have any
question for me just leave it in the
comments below and it should probably be
answered in my next video course D Craig
said if you had 1 million pounds what
would you do with it and why if I had 1
million pounds I would first of all be a
very happy human being I would also not
tell any one of my friends because I
feel like your false friends will become
you know suck up to you and they will be
become even more false friends and I
have all this money and then your real
friends won't talk to you so much
because they'll feel awkward and they
won't want you to think that they're
using you for your money and but I would
give a super meant to charity know / of
course but I will give some of it's
charity and I know that's like a typical
thing for every youtuber to say I would
give some of it to charity of course but
I mean I watch I don't really know what
to do with a million pounds and
obviously I'd go on a huge holiday with
my friends and my parents although I
Republicans in separate rooms so that we
know we can we can just party it out and
me my parents of course not my friends
thinking we're their own Liam's happy
unicorn 999 said what is your Holy Grail
makeup product or high-end and drugstore
my Holy Grail makeup product is probably
this baby here is my Holy Grail makeup
product when it comes to foundation skin
Etsy Rimmel stay matte and the right to
use probably backwards for you Nablus in
ivory
100 it's just such I've got it on my now
and on my cheeks and it's just such
thick coverage like when you have it on
your hands it's so so thick and then
when you put any skin it becomes really
thin and lightweight and it's just so
nice it's a lovely matte foundation and
I love it and ask for mascara my holy
grail is everything
okay watch lash mascara as it just makes
her eyelashes so long and it separates
them especially if you pair it with one
of those eyelash separators tall
thingamajiggy Bundy please Chloe Marie
asked singing or dancing okay so I
really enjoy doing them both I enjoy
acting singing and dancing I find
gassing more fun but I'm probably better
at singing that's my answer

attractive certainly I don't know what
