it's my annoying dog if you can probably
see you can you see him in oh okay he's
excited to lie down now so anyway this
video is going to be a hey guys so
today's video is going to be a question
and answer video and if you have a
question you want to ask me then just
leave it in the comments below I'm not
gonna make you go through my used to buy
more to answer that but if you do want
to go to Mike Instagram and Twitter the
links are below and the names are here
just so I put that self promo in there
okay so the first question is what have
you tried dis your channel okay so I
think this question because I'm really
really excited for my future channel so
basically now I either use my Fujifilm
camera to film or I'll use my fault
whichever I feel like to me the quality
of my phone is actually fairly good if
I've got good lighting so I'm waiting
for Canon t3i to come through and then
I'm getting it go
I'm getting a MacBook as well because I
really want Final Cut Pro so I was like
yeah I'm gonna get it let's download on
my Windows 8 computer I'm sorry buddy it
is only compatible with Apple great and
after blow another nine hundred quid on
a computer so I can use a good editing
software come on
so yeah and I know that all honest air
don't line down without a laptop right
now I've got a 450 pounds towards my
macbook from my laptop my windows say it
once it broke but the future ideas I
have is I'm going to be doing start
doing like nail tutorials they'll be
like a series on nails and stuff so I'm
looking forward to doing that like
minion nails and all these kind of cool
nails and I'm excited to do I can also
get a really good tripod so I can angle
it come really good so I can do like
DIYs there's so many future ideas to my
channel on it you know I'm going to
subscribe please subscribe so you can
see all these future ideas cuz I'm
really really looking forward to it the
next question is do you get a lot of
hate and if so how do you handle it I
don't get too much a
I get quite a bit of hay I'm when I read
it doesn't really put me down
hey if you're getting hate you're doing
something right so I think a lot of it
is my early videos where I didn't really
know what I was doing and I script to
the whole video and it was really there
seemed really fake if you're not an
example please go and view my most
viewed video my how to make your own lip
scope video worst idea ever really
really embarrassing video but you know
what you go and watch it
have fun so I've got quite a bit I hate
from that like people just like you have
know what you're doing what the hell are
you doing if you look at the like and
dislikes I've got quite a lot of
dislikes compared to wipes like the
ratio between the two which isn't great
but you know what if your sketch to our
YouTube channel because you worried
about the hey everyone gets hated
everyone gets you just go get over it
and make your own channel do you ask or
you just the only reason people would
feel the need to hey is if the jealous
because other than that I'll just go I'm
not gonna waste my time on you next
question is have you ever been in an
embarrassing situation okay so back in
the good old days back in year four
fifth grade fourth grade
I don't really know uh I was on I was a
water bottle monitor now if you had
water bottle monitors if you're a water
bottle monitor you were cool so I was
really proud to be a water bottle
monitor so there was really water
bottles and suddenly I thought you know
what I need to pay it's alright
I'll finish filling up the water bottles
so I'm not filling them up and I'm so
focused on how both the water looks
coming out and I think my vagina feels
the need to reenact the peeing emotion
that comes from the top
so yeah I know peeing myself right there
what I wanted to pee myself because I
thought I could hold it in by crossing
my legs but now I couldn't hold it in
just came off flooding out
socks shoes skirt knickers you name it
legs all wet
completely wet so Imogen my best
time goes up to the teacher and goes put
the whole class seems you very loud she
goes Millie's had an accident and I'm
having tears I'm embarrassed I just
pissed myself in front of everyone
I'm really really embarrassed so I'm
just stood there like really upset but
after it people didn't quite get well
the accident was so they're all like did
you do you just over I'm like yeah yeah
do what you know them I'm not over it
yet next question is how old you and how
do you find high school I am 13 almost
14 I'm 14 on the 16th of September and
is currently the sorry I kind of
reminded myself Nicki Minaj do that no
okay
it's the 7th of September some day yeah
I just don't like some days it's called
the next day so it kind of ruins it for
me so I'm 1314 next week 16th September
7th September some nine days how do you
find high school I love high school I
know I'm gonna miss it when I leave and
that's kind of depressing but I haven't
had about this bridge in high school
don't be able to get bullied don't I
don't know I like high school and I
wanna stay I like learning because I'm
really I really want a good job and I'm
older next question is what do you want
to be when you're older will ask
convenient oh okay so I want to be an
actress when I'm older but I don't why
I'm not one of those like but people
that thinks are gonna make it big time
with being an actress because I know
it's a very very dodgy job but I I'm
already halfway there with things that I
do so if I can expand on it then I could
have it as like a job but I'm also want
to be a freelancing beautician and I'll
work for myself so if I ever have an
audition I don't have to get the time
off I can just pack up my stuff and go I
think that's gonna be a really good job
something that I love if you don't not
feel Lansing is basically you work for
yourself mainly you'll carry around back
with you and you'll have a card and a
phone number and if people want you to
do the hair makeup nails
waxing whatever they'll just give you a
ring and I just think masks
easiest thing to do said if I have a job
where have to go off for four months
filming I can just pack up my stuff and
leave for four months and then get back
when I get back I'll just open it back
up again pretty cool so that is the end
of the video I really hope you enjoyed
it
stay tuned for my next video which will
probably mean me box unboxing so have a
jam-packed day stay positive and I love
you all na</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
