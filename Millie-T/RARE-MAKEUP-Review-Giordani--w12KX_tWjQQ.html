into the video you know this is from the
title issue if you are in my opinion a
rare makeup brand because you can't find
it many places but it is very very
popular in places that do know of the
brand the brand is to have done it and
it is partnered with Oakland the
cosmetics are on the price range of I
would say drugstore in the middle of
drugstore and high-end makeup in the
middle of their and on average our
products probably cost about 12 pounds
each but seriously it is worth it just
watch the review and you'll know why
first thing I would like to talk about
is what I got from them what I received
from them
mascara bronzing pearls foundation
makeup base and lipstick so I will go
first into the foundation don't the
foundation all in all with the packaging
it's gorgeous
it has a translucent type glass in that
I really love like if you can see like
you can kinda see the color behind it
but you can't make out any detailed
features like on winged the packaging is
very simple that of maybe Mac and kind
of Sephora and think places like that
very simple packaging but simple is
better in my opinion let's talk about
benefit then benefits open globby an
exception because they're amazing I have
to say I love the logo if you see the
logo they're very young mature I also
love how the more they have like a
selection of makeup and it's gold so
it's like geode any gold that's what it
is
and this one is age defying foundation
first of all the price the price of this
13 pounds times 5 so the price of these
products are halfway between my end and
jokes or basically States right and it
makes as well what I do is I don't
normally tend to put makeup a sudden
that foundation I'll just make them
together
why do notice well sparox is that it
glides onto your skin so easily doesn't
mean your skin oil and doesn't make you
have spots or breakouts at all
definitely has some sort of moisturizing
base as my skin instantly feels
dead a 1 square well 1/2 square and a
little bit of makeup base to kind of
make it a lighter shade and I've still
got some left over which is my completed
face after I've applied the foundation
and I think I needed a bit more makeup
face as it is still a shade too dark boy
something to worry about I don't need to
redo that bit as it is perfectly fine I
think I am found I don't know what to
say sighs it look of great things about
them first of all I want to say the age
and kind of range it would go from now I
will publish a view every trade exchange
a13 over because simply this one is the
age defying foundation now they do have
a lots more foundations that maybe
aren't age defying and they will be
perfect for younger people and maybe
even old people if you have Botox SPF o8
yeah so if you don't if you have skin
that doesn't burn very easily on holiday
that's scary and there is 30 milliliters
in this filled desk in Java then I will
kill you now one thing I can say about
the foundation in the make up basis is
to make it better the product probably
get lids on them I'm not sure because if
you're carrying around in your bag can
you fight put your bag down in the
bottles this way up then obviously the
pumps gonna go explode all of your whole
bag which won't be very good but if you
do keep this in like your makeup
collection or anything like that you
wanna see my make up collection lights
video just so I know cuz I'll be doing
it quite soon I'll comment below like do
make up go to your video just so I know
cuz I'm starting collecting everything
and then it's gonna all go and it's a
bigger base and if you get got laid see
it would be you could and trap take them
around traveling a lot easier but the
makeup base you can mix it with your
foundation it does make a light color
but not if you only use a little bit
makes a whole product creamier adding
this it's basically just a product
improver for the foundation and a good
makeup base is basically and soaks into
your skin and kinda creates a kind of
protective layer so when you put your
foundation on the founda it kind of sits
on top of there and does not so I am
very I really do honestly love this
product and the thing that I would say
but this is really nitpicking but if you
do want to know it can vary in lots of
detail oh you who are watching then the
packet the product just start to wear
away from the packaging light is you can
see there but all you need to do for
that is just like and then it simply
goes away this is 10 pounds 95
this the bronzing pearls are 16 pounds a
95 which is definitely high in price
they are definitely worth it so hey you
have the whole packaging it's kind of
goldish rough sephora type thing at the
bottom but yeah yeah so it's like used
to four types world there and it's
really simple on top I love simple I
love simple I'll think simple and I love
simple products so simple is a good
thing and I'm just a bronzer my pills
are more than ready style if you can see
there so if I were going I would not use
this as a kind of drop in a pearl I
would not use this as a full face
bronzer because my face I did try it
because obviously you gotta try it even
if he's scared of it and it did make my
face look kind of like I've been doing
I've been running half marathon well
Marsden but I love love love love love
this product as if so I'll apply it now
just so you can see
the cool for this is very natural unspun
it's absolutely great applying the brush
and applying just the right amount I
love the color for a blush I would
highly recommend as a blush but not
necessarily a brighter face as you older
I don't think you really want a pinkish
or ready to look on your cheeks if you
do then that's fine I would definitely
recommend this product if not then go
and have a look at all the other items
it lasts all day doesn't shine or glow
or anything like that because it's
amazing I learned your daily gold lash
panorama mascara and I love how we've
put detail into this product as well
just by adding those little that little
thing there like all the decorations and
how everything's gold and black it just
looks so like mature on I love the
packaging of this so much and so that is
the packaging and all about it and then
when you take it the brush out the sound
it makes
okay and then the blue brush is very
like different if you love them bushes
and this is the kind of brush your wine
against down it against the bottom
shouldered like the hairs on it so we
just just work wonders that I'll show
you my eyelashes now cuz I've already
applied it I am not joking this is what
my eyes look like with the mascara on
the eyelashes are so separated so I was
good lighting right there so separated
like seriously they're no clumps
whatsoever and they work gorgeous on my
bottom lashes I am keep walking
everything I am seriously honestly
impressed with this product with the
mascara it lengthens your eyelashes
makes him a really dark black as black
as you can get and it was so sexy and
they look natural they don't look fake
anything like that and something bad
about it
and one sec I think while I'm trying to
think about things about it I just got
more good things thinness and the size
of it size of it is good just it's so
thin and small it'll fit anywhere
downside to it some people might want
more product in it but suicides think
mass perfect amount in there and it's in
the color black maybe they could do more
colors like blue purple and red and pink
and green and orange and yellow and but
they are having a massive sale on it and
there's like mascara like three pounds
have been brought down from 52 so that's
like mac in max price treatment it's
down some squares been three pounds yeah
I'm gonna flame and buy the mascara so
unless they don't why the most favorite
products the lipstick first of all I
want to talk about the packaging gold
enemies for line on the top design on it
oh wow and it is in the color pink
secret I love pink and I love secrets
oh where can you go wrong the color you
get out of the frame coral black doesn't
do any justice looks a bit orange on
there but it's no orange
new joy doesn't look easy don't worry
anything kind of like when applying this
lipstick I really notice how the pull of
the lipstick in this ingredients and it
really worked with my lip color and it
just glides on effortlessly and the
color at the end is just amazing and I
love this product lasts all day
no unfortunately but if you take it
around in your handbag then is perfect
you're just taking it around with you
and it just really work
just taking it just taking it around the
house with you and things like that so I
would definitely recommend this product
as well
smell grease a not sticky once that I
get it maybe if you wanted to do
something is include a big color on the
bottom of the packaging and like it are
quite a lot of makeup brands here they
include colors on the bottom like a
little kind of extracts in the color
well maybe you should do this but it's
not too much of public so you just take
the lid off and to see the color and
it's a gorgeous cool I don't think you
could have send me a better color thank
you so much for that that is the end of
my video I recommend airplane cosmetics
obviously I'm gonna posted and links in
the Bible everything you can send to me
dear Danny and Oriflame thank you so
much when I received them
I was trying them out and I am really
impressed you deserve so much more
publicity in the UK in America and I
just I was blown away by your cosmetic
sake
I was seriously impressed by the quality
of them how amazing the quality was I
mean favorite devlins mascara lipstick
and the bronzer is bullsháá so now how
I feel about the bronze feel it's not
good for bronze in my opinion that's my
opinion it depends what skin shade you
have over blusher it's like the best
product ever so it's kind of like I mean
comment below what you think and olive
