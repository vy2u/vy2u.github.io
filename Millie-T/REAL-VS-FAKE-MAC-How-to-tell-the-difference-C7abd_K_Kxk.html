on how to tell if your mac lipstick is
real or fake so I went into Selfridges I
bought a obviously genuine matte
lipstick which is in the color creamy
pink that I will get out for you right
now
it's that color like that left roaming
clear hands and I also have a another
one which is the Lady Gaga Viva Glam so
basically more people will kind of
relate to this video and that is in the
color just a nude pink so this is the
fake one I like that first of all we'll
start with the packaging now this seller
that I bought this off is actually very
very talented in making it look
absolutely identical but they have still
missed out quite a lot of things so
first of all with the packaging with all
my products every single thing to the
real lipsticks in Mac has the same
package in size I don't care what
product to this is always the same size
so um first of all I'll just put these
two together like that you can pretty
obviously tell that that one the fake
one is bigger than this one then at the
bottom it should have a printed color
not a sticker a printed color so this is
a original one in color oh gotta stop
focusing sync Jemaine and then this one
is in the color Verve and it's a sticker
so how much more obvious could you get
it from that so that's the obvious one
because Mac don't really tend to use
stickers because it's all high-end
makeup so they will just put everything
on the packaging but obviously they have
made a massive mistake in putting a
sticker on there still actually on the
packaging and on the inside where the
product is under lots of them on the
inside it should be plain white now on
these two inside it is plain white
uneven the fake one that's because these
until the I bought it off was actually
so skilled at it as well and so but a
lot of people can find that their color
on the inside is like a gray color and
that is a massive giveaway as well onto
the products here now if you don't look
closely they look absolutely identical
but then if you take a closer look on
this one it through writing is thin very
thin and long and on this one it's also
very thin and long so that is not
obvious at all but then the Mack writing
is actually starting to chip away
already and I only use this once so you
can see there
so that out I just and I'm just where so
that I was like wow you couldn't make
that more obvious okay so if you've got
a real want a big one at home test this
out right now and you will know for
definite it's fake or real Mac are very
precise in their products everything is
the same size when it comes to lipsticks
okay so take both the lids off both of
them and then swap them around one fist
and one doesn't by actually not of the
match Lafitte so if I will turn this
upside down now this is the fake lid on
the real Mac that's Gordon it then this
one does it actually go down any further
so I'll just drop off again
okay also another massive thing that I
actually noticed myself is that if you
smell both of them now if it's genuine
back it will smell really nice like a
and vanilla types well I'm not really
sure how to explain it really sweet nice
vanilla smell and if it's fake
they'll smell of absolutely nothing so
that is another massive massive giveaway
if you look inside the product and as
well will actually decide about the slut
slant of it again they have been doing a
massive MA amazing job at making them
look identical but I just don't like the
fake I just definitely this one's fake I
could tell when I bought it from the
packaging and I know it now
so this is a genuine Mac it just slopes
down there if it's fake it'll either go
like that the slope so kind of like a
weird demented rainbow or it will just
be just flat like that where is this
goes up a tiny bit at the end as the
Syst because again they are really
talented in this
with a fake one as you can see you've
got these little like um bumps here no
after a few I am putting the lid on and
off and on enough they will start to
degrade and go and look a bit black
might haven't done that yet I actually
haven't used it well I'm not planning on
doing since Gordon have been after this
video and because I muck fake back is
just know after a while these dots will
turn black because of where and that is
another big giveaway wise on this one
they will just stay completely silver or
red if you have the unique Minaj Viva
Glam okay now another big giveaway is at
the bottom of the lipstick with the
color number now again saint-germain
this one is the real one and this one is
the fake one this one is really simple
if you look or is this one it's more
detailed which is the real one this
one's real one
so it says amplified saint-germain and
then the product number
this one says Verve and the product
number which the writing is just
different
if you look at the coolest of these
stickers because like few stickers on
the bottom of the products it's just on
the package and they don't tend to use
stickers um so if you look at the bottom
there that one is more of a washed out
grade kind of thing you should say and
then this one is a kind of white really
metallic white and then this one is just
really great another massive giveaway is
the feeling of the packaging fake one is
red so red for wrong and then these
silver one is and the genuine one so
silver for a silver lining and so this
is already chipped away even more which
I actually can't believe how bad that is
and then this one is just intact
completely and so the feeling of the
actual packaging so the fake one if I
feel that is if you listen so quite
smooth and if I feel the real one it's
less of a loud sound if you like I mean
so the real one not explain the feeling
of it it's kind of like am a like when
you've just polished your nails and
painted your nails and put glossy coat
of the top and your nails feel super
smooth that is what this feels like why
is this one feels like your nails been
painted and then have a tiny grins tiny
tiny belly of your screens of sand over
the top of it so that they are really
the main things to pick out when you're
judging on whether it's genuine or
whether it's genuine or fake but they
are the main ones and as I said before
if you don't fit right then it's a no
yes
put them on turn upside down and they
both fall off one of them is fake and
you probably know which one is real so
at the end of the video how to tell if a
Mac is fake or not when it comes to lips
and honestly I am putting this in the
bin after this video cuz I I can't even
look at it it's fake and then this one
can go everywhere with me in my handbag
because it's amazing so if you'll excuse
me I will go and chop this in the bin
