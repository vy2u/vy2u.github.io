first of all and this is going to be a
Christmas haul filmed on Christmas Day
that is a new one onto the video but
just really really quickly I have made a
Twitter and it's a brand new Twitter
that I've just created a few hours ago
please if you want to give me Christmas
present know some song follow me on
there and I'll be posting polls all you
tubulated letting you know on updating
my videos really relatable tweets
because I'm a I'm a Messer yeah just
follow if you want off so please leave a
comment I love to read your comments let
me know what you got for Christmas
actually really want to know what did
you get for Christmas so we've all seen
the hype over social media all the links
Africa for boys always being like I
wonder how many guys will get the links
Africa is set for Christmas again and
well I just feel like girls don't get
enough recognition like we get the links
Africa stays Welsh the girls version or
at least I do like links Africa set for
her links up and get set for her I've
got another two at my auntie's house I
get loads but I love it because girly
companies lack body spray body wash in
one like this kind of form up they need
more of it like this the links you're
ahead of the game congratulations also
I'm not being sarcastic in this video I
just the way I speak so it sounds very
sarcastic listen up it's a macaroon set
absolutely love my macaroon so so much
I've got strawberry pistachio and lemon
never tried the lemon home but I love
the pistachio one I want to go through
these quite quickly as well because you
don't really want to hear me talk about
one product for like 10 minutes and just
stay the obvious next was off my friend
mo because she got Musa Secret Santa I
would use it with our friendship group
of course every female youtuber that
does even slightly related Beauty videos
has to get a candle for Christmas so I
got this one by so Ella it's called my
Eden it's so classy and minimalistic
looking which I very much like so it's
quite on my shelf and being burnt for
some kind of video if I do a night
routine obviously she also got me some
lush stuff she got me blush sex-bomb
bath balm all of this one so much it
smells so nice like very perfume scented
isn't everything at lush and she also
got me a butter bear bath balm which is
so moisturizing
just to go to everything I got from
washes while I got this dream Queen
which is moisturizing cream always
forward my moms don't have to do that
anymore and I got some rules drums
shower gel and I've never seen this
before
even got my massive fan of gosh well it
just smells so nice
and I also an outer shell gel coat a
give a shout out to these well got a lip
balm duo and it's one of them's bell uni
I have no idea what scent that is but I
knew who wanted pina colada and I love
to smell anything Pina Colada centered
is gorgeous next area but was off my
stepdad and this is the Michael Kors
wonder lost perfume and it smells really
nice I'm so money describing perfumes
and cents in general so I'm not even
going to go there but yeah the Michael
Kors one loss is such a nice perfume and
by the way I've got a lot of money this
Christmas as well because I never tell
people what I want because I always feel
really bad asking for stuff so I never
say what I want and then I always get
money instead but I'm not gonna hold
money to you because that's just so not
me all anyone hopeful it and my mom push
down the ball a lot but this year we've
got me some Tesco earrings and I'm not
even being sarcastic I usually get my
successive earrings from Primark and the
one pound fifty four pack of like 20 or
so and I'm fine with them like I bought
them I always go back to Primark because
the amount of earrings you get for such
a good price yes to that but Tesco five
quid for like twelve earrings it's
ridiculous for I'll be wearing them
anyway thanks mom oh my cousin I got a
MAC lipstick I love my lipstick so much
obviously I've got a massive collection
of them I just they're just amazing and
this one is rebel and I'd heard a rebel
so much as soon as I saw the name and
walks it on my snapchat I was like oh my
god rebel the dock purple one a little
bit put it on a little bit Mike
lipsticks that they are the best
lipsticks and don't even try to argue
with me on also I got this Jack Wills
purse which is really cute and it got
it's like a lipstick in it as well and
actually looked at the lipstick of every
back soon unboxing video now I didn't
actually realize to add a lipstick
that's nice I actually don't have a
lipstick that shade part for my Kylie
lip kit and candy K which is kind of
similar I also got this ends like a
decoration ornament with tea light
candles at the top it's so different and
unique and it adds like a rustic vibe to
my room which I love
alright and also I got this DK my
perfume it's pecan why be delicious in
bread I've had the gold put on the Apple
one but the red one is the nicest smell
by far I'm not even gonna try and
describe it but it's just hopefully it
won't play I also got these earring
sorry grandma I got these earrings would
you like hearts I'm the so subtle and
cute and I never like really have subtle
earrings cuz all my earrings ovarium out
they're massive ones
these aren't and the very subtle which
is a change for me but I kind of like
change sometimes simple skin stuff
cannot go wrong with them this is a
whole of the conspiracy theory video but
other like skincare brands often lead
you to breakouts you buy more that
products but simple just don't they're
just so good for your skin and will be
done every year I could be lining to get
me this so Maltesers my Stabbin also got
me to learn to more cash negative life
and he's just so cool it's like a hot
chocolate Sasha coffee / tu / hot water
beverage holder it's cop thing
hello its lens and I just I think it's
so cool it's so realistic looking
I'm just bewildered it's got some hair
stuff hairspray and styling mousse
forgot so much these and that's not a
bad thing I learnt a very good thing I'm
saying it in a good way more perfume as
well of my secrets under Emma going back
to that and I got some Victoria Secret
perfumes they smell so go those there's
another one as well blasting my bag and
I'm just too lazy to go and get it and
on the perfume spectrum as well I got
this river island Paris by night perfume
but I haven't opened it yet and because
I don't feel the need to open it before
I've opened all my other perfumes I
forgot to get to them first obviously
and more Jacqueline's body spray stuff
perfumed body spray is something that
Jack Wills do very well
I also haven't got me and this new look
black bodysuit and I was in need of a
playing black policy late because I've
got on with a choker and a zip as well I
also got this and this bracelet as well
this is from River Island it's off my
mom and I love it so much like such a
classy looking choker if that's even
possible and this gorgeous love dainty
bracelet and I don't do dainty jewelry
so they sit like this and those earrings
are very new to me and also my mom also
got this t-shirt as well from new look
and it's like it I love embroidered
colors and if you can't tell from this
like very glittery choker and she got me
this why a embellished top that you can
literally wear with like jeans and stuff
