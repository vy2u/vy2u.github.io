my facebook profile I have had it for
quite a while now or a long time I do
not use it as much as I used to do at
all but and not once have I ever dilly
in a picture of Facebook and I have had
some extremely embarrassing ones but
I've kept them on and today at that has
proven to be useful because I'm going to
use it for this video so I hope you
enjoy it if you do don't forget to
subscribe
let's go okay so I'm looking down and
I'm thinking that I must have been Spain
and created in the album because I have
one here of me in a sombrero hat Wow
okay that's attractive I have to say and
I'll look a like I have issues which I
do bought to the next level and this
picture so let's truthfully move on from
that one ah the first day of primary
school ah this was updated in 2009 so
I've had my Facebook for six years now
so these are six years old so my first
day of primary school I'm now in my nice
cool blue ticket pinafore I'm now in
America I know you don't have a uniform
bought in the UK and other parts of the
world even there was a competition for
the swaggiest person in school and it
was the pinafore
now some people had a nice sophisticated
great pinafore or this handing of blue
and white checks and others had red and
white checks my favorite was blue and
white checks and this is my favorite
pitiful because it had a heart charm on
the front as a zip and I was rather
proud of that I still and mother proud
of that and this one here okay right
this is a good one right this one was my
favorite outfit and it was my favorite
outfit for about a year this outfit was
all that I wore it was a nice orange
sunny
top with a flowy granny looking orange
slush why kind of ombre effect skirt and
then I had some frilly socks on with
some dollar shoes and that was just all
strapped out really and and I was really
really happy with this outfit I
so unbelievably proud of it and I was
just constantly wearing it and now I
look back on it and I just ask myself
why iOS vote - oh my goodness me
all right this photo this was the s7
first day the s7 no it wasn't first week
first year sometime in year 7 and I took
this photo right it was an original
Instagram photo I take out my Instagram
and post it don't judge my eyebrows
before puberty I had really like how
like I have blonde hair now but I have
highlights in about yourself like bleach
blonde hair bleach blonde eyebrows
everything like that and this picture
just proves it
so this I took a picture of it on
Instagram and I uploaded it and it got
around 150 likes on it and I had about
100 followers maybe even less than that
and I was so proud of that and again I
look back and asked myself why right you
know what 2007 I was 7 years - oh my god
I've had my profile since 2007 since it
was about seven I'm sorry I'm a rebel
right so this one I was 7 years old and
I decided to have a drink a beer for
Christmas so that I have a bottle of
Stella in my hands there and I was
taking a short pitch and I was like wait
take it now I just I was just a rebel I
really thought I was a rebel with that
and I was so proud with myself and that
Bob why was i proud of that Bob I don't
know whether I thought that I had bangs
in this you know because it just looks
like a little clump of hair there and
then every little wisp there and they're
not the best look oh my god that is a
terrible picture me and my best friend
at the time cause Jess we had just won a
competition in go beyond magazine and it
was like a huge competition and the
biggest one that ever done and we won it
so we got like it shipped down to London
50 pounds of new look a photo shoot
appear in the magazine camcorder iPod
and you know stopped in the hotel for
like two nights and
just like this huge like a war like
prides is that they gave out and we was
soso chopped so this is on the train on
the way down we was so excited and I
just remember this and I'm gonna go get
the magazine for you now so you can see
our appearance in it here we are you
know like Laurie meets in a million
winners that was us then we get further
part in the magazine we have double page
spread oh it's so so happy at the time
right so this is like competition winner
and for this competition to entry you
had to design your own handbag and then
send it off to them I don't think many
people entered it because ours was
terrible right so this is as just like
sisters which took like a little sequin
on at the front and then Jess and Milly
and then the pictures we took with cut
out and just took him around the edge
and like dude some like nice designs so
yeah we went to a photo shoot that day
and we had a real a really good time it
was we had such a good time now right
here this was the next issue there were
two consecutive issues that we appeared
in so this was neither one so this was
my page like we holding like all these
presents I was really happy with this
picture it it's not too bad actually
so yeah I think that it's a pretty good
note to end the video on I will hope you
enjoyed it if you did that give a thumbs
up and don't forget to leave a comment
telling me your thoughts and which
picture was the most embarrassing
because I am kind of spoiled for choice
although I think I've an idea which was
the most embarrassing having reached of
