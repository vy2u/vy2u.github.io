Hello everyone
It's Millie and welcome to another reaction video
You guys seem to really like my reaction videos when i do them
So, I thought I'd do another, because I really enjoy filming them as well
So this one is going to be a f*ckgirl musical.ly compilation reaction
So
*sighs* are you ready?
Let's prepare ourselves and get ready to watch this
And also subscribe if you like reaction videos because I have a few more planned for the future
But I wont be doing loads at all
You'll still see my normal videos
I am expecting to see alot of twerking, so ...
Yay!
O-, oh my god, oh my god...
Oh, I seen that one
I have seen this one
She is not old, oh my god
No, see I could accept it but then she started grinding on the floor
Oh, she's gorgeous!
And she's over 18. And not naked. And it's just hip movements... which is a dance move
It's very good dancing. *chuckles*
I wanna watch one of these then the parents walk in
That would be an absolute dream for me
If anyone knows any video where that happens please let me know in the comments section
I wanna go and find that video
No!
*sighs*
I'm surprised Youtube haven't flagged these videos, it's literally 13-year-olds and 12-year-olds and 10 year olds even
Twerking
Why would you film yourself doing this?
None of them can even twerk, like I think twerking is like really good when they can actually do it
But...not when its like young pre-teens doing it
Like this girl, no!
I don't feel comfortable watching it
I like this song *clicks*
*clicks*
*clicks* como se ama
Bonita
She's just doing the same thing over and over again
And she's... *sighs*
Nooo!
These girls are not old
They are not old at all
*gasps* Where are their mothers?
That- This one's not too bad
I mean it's not great but it's not too bad
*snickers*
What- Is that an actual song?
Oh my god!
Okay, this girl has a tattoo so I think she's over 18
Reminds me of *inaudible* but just the Walmart edition
Or Asda edition, depending on where you live.
Sings - *Riding my pony*
*My saddle's waiting*
*Come and jump on it*
No, you ruined it, you ruined it, you ruined it
Slight interval whilst it buffers
Where are their parents?
Musical.ly is something that pre-teens mainly go on, isn't it?
Like you don't find really grown women on there
Ummm, so twerking in musical.lys just
Are they not embarr- Oh my god!
Are they not embarrassed if they... Nooo!
*sighs*
Another one here...here we go!
You've ruined this song!
Oh Nooo!
You've ruined...*inaudible* right I can never listen to that song again now, so thanks for that!
*gasps*
No!
No, no, no...
No, no, no, what are you doing, what are you doing, what are you doing, stop!
Stop, stop!
Sings *inaudible*
There's not even any variation to the dance moves that's the only thing
Cause they are all doing that controlla thing with their hip, you know that controlla challenge on Musica.ly
Where (awkwardly) they...do...like...that...with their hips thing. They just keep doing that
It's the exact same thing with every single video
And the same songs
*inaudible* I think
If anyone commented she's 13, I'm 13. Like that's disgusting like don't do that
I know there will be those comments as well
Right okay that's it
I'm done, I'm done, that's as much as I can take for one day
I hope you enjoyed this reaction video, if you want me to do any more reaction videos
Leave them in the comments below, please subscribe if you're still watching
Ummm, yeah, have a beautiful day and don't forget to stay positive
Mwah, bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
