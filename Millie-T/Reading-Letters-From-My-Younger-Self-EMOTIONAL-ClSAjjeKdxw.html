a week and a half ago I think it was we
hit nine hundred thousand subscribers my
brain can't not comprehend that number
ever since I hit 100k my brain has
stopped being able to register how many
people that actually is I'm literally
speechless at this point like we are so
close to a million a number that I like
never thought was even remotely in reach
also when you are watching this video my
merch will have just been released I'm
wearing it right now that's me with a
bandana make some wear bundle it a lot
and also I have it in Y a metallic
silver there's also a little cheeky
something on the back of this and I also
have it in black and rose gold as you
can see here and on the back is say stay
with memories of not dreams cuz that's a
quote that I hold very close to me
because it just basically means take
every opportunity that you get and live
life to the fullest this also has the
quote on the bag in metallic silver
writing and I also have pop sockets you
can find on the website and also these
in t-shirt version this is also my first
ever merch job so I'm very nervous but
also very excited for it to be released
I don't really know what to expect but I
just I'm very very excited to you guys
wearing in stuff they'll be very like
surreal feeling and if I see anyone out
in public like wearing that would be mad
that would be mad and if you do end up
buying anything definitely seventy
screech of your order confirmation on
Twitter so I can follow you know that
that's like a big deal but it's just
like the lease and I could do anyway for
you like supporting me in that way if
you think you could rinse like one more
Christmas present off your mom and
definitely take a look at the merch
website and see the Simpson the TT fancy
and then beg okay let's go into the past
now so there's a website called future
me dog
this isn't sponsored I wish it was
anyway you can write an email to
yourself and deliver it in the future so
if I were to write a letter now in
December I could get it delivered a year
from now to my email me explaining it
really makes it seem like the most
pointless thing in the world but we're
just gonna roll with it enjoy and when I
say a blast from the past I've been
writing letters to myself on this
websites it's literally like 2014
some now thought was worth mentioning I
was 14 when I wrote this so don't cringe
you will cringe al Green's as well is
fine will cringe together this is really
weird I know but I have a few things to
say oh no oh this is so embarrassing
this is sparta krishna honey
high school on October the 4th
roundabouts he was paying a lot of
attention to me and we were getting on a
lot there was a lot of flirting and I'm
hoping that it turned into something
wrong I have a feeling you will have
lost interest but hopefully not if he is
you are so so looking around a year
later I realize that he actually did
have feelings for me and then I lost all
interest instantly it happens all the
time it's a genuine problem like it's
not even funny anymore it's literally
just a case of me liking what I can't
have also I hope my acting is doing good
it is something I really want to pursue
in the future but I'm not so sure right
now I just have to make sure I act
naturally my auditions I used to do
acting a lot used to get a lot of
auditions because it was to be in the
age that I was out where I was like a
child and it was really good for
auditions I've been in a film before
then we went to the showing for that
film and it was really good it's really
cringe now on and never want to see
those scenes because I was ugly as a
child like I was so ugly pre braces pre
eyebrows pre everything you know how
people go through a midlife crisis that
was me at age 12 I still love acting but
I've quit my drama school because if I'm
gonna go into acting it will probably be
through YouTube I hope I'm still friends
with Kirsty - we were quite new in our
friendship when we are planning on
starting a scrapbook soon this is quite
a personal video but I'm happy about it
I want you guys to feel like you know me
we've made the scrapbook this is me
asleep on her I love sleeping on people
it's like my favorite thing ever this is
when we were about 14 the Sigma Premier
Inn and Villa 4 we have a lot of
memories together and they're all in
this scrapbook now this is a really cool
bit I currently have five and a half
thousand subscribers and 200,000 total
video views' logically speaking I'm
hoping to have about 15,000 subscribers
which is a huge amount
my total Youtube subscriber goal is
100,000 and if I reach it next year then
Wow it won't happen but that would be
amazing I didn't teach it next year I
didn't expect to my youtube channel grew
so slowly at first and literally just
recently or in the past year blew off
suddenly for some reason actually Thank
You eBay then I wrote another one a year
later on October the 4th 2015 to receive
on October 4th
sixteen thing is I'm still friends with
the sky we see to that every now and
again he has no idea I had a crush on
him but if I read this out he'll know
and he'll be scarred for life and be
like what I think my goal is only 2,000
subscribers which is if that is how many
I have then oh my god the silver plaque
silver plaque there is I hope you mock
GCSEs went well with a and a star grades
did it no not at all so I wrote this
letter March of this year to receive on
my birthday September the 16th of this
year I remembered this letter is the one
that hit me the most talked about
YouTube in YouTube friends a lot which
was like mad because I wrote this in
March you just made a big decision to
not go to sick form after summer to just
concentrate on YouTube being a full-time
youtuber is a massive massive dream of
yours so it would only be sensible to
grab the opportunity while sits there as
I'm writing this I'm dreading that you
are currently at sixth form with the
hopes and dreams of YouTube just
completely gone if that's the case and
that's terrible and I'm really sorry do
all you can to get into a job that you
love such as something to do with the
media I'm not sure what caused YouTube
to die but if it was a lack of effort on
your part then it's your own fault and I
guess this is the price you pay for it
however if when you are reading this you
are currently taking on YouTube
full-time then Wow well done you have an
incredible opportunity so do all you can
to become more and more successful
you've been doing YouTube for almost
five years now you've gone through so
much stress and hard work October 2016
was when the growth began and in five
months you went from less than ninety K
subscribers to almost 450,000 never take
you for granted and ensure you always
produce quality content remembering to
keep up with the vlogs much as possible
not so trippy to read I remember writing
this and thinking I'm so gonna be sign
class and stick phone when I received
this and I'm literally gonna be so like
heartbroken the literally takes oh my
god Alicia takes me but so much I'm so
grateful to be in this position you have
no idea but I don't always think about
it because I'm kind of used to it now so
you would be so every now and again I'll
get hit by reality by reading letters
like this and it just trips me out by
the way I haven't read any of these
letters in so long I literally just
bought this idea and I have them all
together on my email also you're going
to
in a few weeks oh my god Amsterdam okay
this is what I was going to VidCon
Amsterdam with the YouTube management I
was with at the time and I was going
with Spencer Spencer was the only person
that I actually knew that was going and
this is where Spencer introduced me to
call me who is literally like one of my
best friends now and I always have so
much love for that guy like you don't
even understand oh my I don't even know
it's just quite overwhelming it's like
you look back on and read because it's
just realizing how like far I've come
and stuff and hamlets you like living
the dream that I've had for so long on
YouTube let you choose a hobby for so
long and then all of a sudden I could do
it full-time and that's what I'm doing
now it just literally feels so surreal
to me like the people I've met from
there and it scares me it just scares me
thinking about if I just never film that
first youtube video I just wouldn't be
here right now or that such a scary
thought it's such the butterfly effect
you're going to Amsterdam in a few weeks
and as much as you're looking forward to
it you don't really know what to expect
you are hoping that you get on really
well with leaf and that you and Carly
will have a good friendship too as he
seems like a really good friend in terms
of human just his personality in general
you are just hoping there will be plenty
of laughing late nights and good
memories made with some finest vlogs and
maybe one of more collab videos Crim's I
said fine ass like first of all let's
say that and that was this year as well
oh my god when I was writing this I did
not realize how much of a friend Kong
you turn into like literally best friend
it's uneven Spencer as well because that
was the first time I met Carly but the
second time I met Spencer and I have no
idea how close I've become dispenser as
well we went to LA like a few months
later me car me and Spencer
you can watch the plugs on my channel
you can also watch the Amsterdam vlogs
of my vlog channel I have them all on
there you're also planning on oh my god
you're also planning on coming out with
your old pop sake since you ever get
around that hopefully you didn't you
were happy with the final results I
can't even imagine your viewers sending
you tweets and stuff of them with that
pop song kiss so if they did them wow I
bet that's an incredible feeling thank
them as often as you can and never ever
take them for granted
that's not about you guys sternward to
self how worth it is literally the same
day that I'm reading this they get
released somewhere I vote this one
before YouTube as a job was even an
option when I just thought I would
receive this and I would be in sick form
no doubt okay I'm guessing a lot has
changed the year or at least I hope it
has for the better you are probably too
sick from now hopefully studying and
preparing for a job you love currently
I'm consider
psychiatry if I have to take chemistry
to a level which would be very
challenging it would and that's why you
didn't do it I swear to god you better
have gone to be fast for the weekend and
I hate you if you didn't because if
something you've always wanted to do and
yeah I did want to go to speedfest until
I saw the lineup and that made me change
my mind
also if you've not here 100,000
subscribers you are doing I need to get
a grip
don't put YouTube I can only have 80 4k
subscribers and 5 million views my last
video is on the meaning of life it was
at Lotus today and if you have been to
any you two events and oh my god yes
unlikely but you know I traveled to
Amsterdam for a YouTube event I'd been
to sit see for YouTube been in London
I've been to LA for VidCon I've been to
my fair share of YouTube events
I'm beautycon as well that was like a
few weeks ago I have a history section
to examine Thursday and I'm so nervous I
should be advised him when he said I'm
writing this email to you in the future
so it's looking hopeful so far hopefully
I got at least 17 out of 20 I think I
got oh I got full marks got 20 out of 20
for that one also you went to Max's
earlier today and chilled on the Xbox
and went to subway I doubt you are still
friends now as he has his football but
that's life yeah me and Max is still
really good friends I saw him yesterday
I absolutely love him yeah we're still
friends how are things going in the boys
section
don't settle for any less Nate go
understand this is what I kind of like a
massive crush on a gunner I thought he
was gorgeous I literally wrote a boy
section but in my head I was like I
really don't get gold I just had two
girls success I'm for my mom to be happy
and healthy with notifications I wrote
this on October the 24th 2016 when I hit
100,000 subscribers ok ok so where
Dwight and I received this a year
thoughts worth mentioning 100,000
subscribers was an old time goal for me
like that number was just unreal in my
head like I oh I had like a mental
breakdown when I hit that number I just
couldn't comprehend the I was speechless
a few weeks ago you thought 100,000
wouldn't even be achieved by the end of
the year but you're ok with that then
suddenly your channel blew up after
posting reaction videos and you claim
100,000 faster than ever stay humble and
appreciate those who have gotten you to
where you are now you better realize how
lucky you are to have people that would
take time out of their day to send you a
long and heartfelt message not theirs
you may not even read it appreciate that
they take time out that day to follow
you on other social media and stay
active with you on that appreciate that
some of them talk about you with that
friends and watch your videos together
so so blessed I really don't know what
else I can say because you know how much
you've wanted this
congratulations and never stop striving
to achieve your dreams really oh wow um
yeah oh I I have a very strong feeling
of fulfillment right now just for my
role in those letters like I hope you're
a hundred thousand I hope you have two
hundred thousand you know never give up
if you're doing it full-time that's
incredible I currently have three
letters traveling the future that I'm
not yet delivered that I can't access
but I've got one being delivered August

December the 24th 2017 oh I have one
