do just want to get out the way that I
have so much makeup on because I'm going
out for me later on just to kind of
celebrate the end of exams because we
have like exams in the UK and also my
step-brother attic his exams for the
a-levels I think it was or something
like that so we got out for meal to
celebrate that so here does back home
okay so today's video it's kind of
depressing but quite funny at the same
time so I was 11 years old I had this
amazing idea to write a few no letter so
if I died my family would find this and
really - I swear down from bottom my
heart that I'd not just write this now
from sake of a video I wrote it when I
was 11 and I can swear down on my mum's
life but that is exactly what I did so I
just wanted to get that out the way rock
funeral letter Part 1 11 years old dear
family and friends if you are reading
this and probably lost or dead but if I
am lost
I promise by Almighty God that I have
not went away no matter what
circumstances I would never do that to
you so I have probably been stolen I
just want to say a big thank you to my
friends for being there for me through
bad and good I want to say thank you to
my family for loving me so dearly and
spoiling me in my will
I would like to split my money evenly
between my family apart from my mom and
dad that I would like to have an extra
200 pound each I hope Nathan's doing
well in the army and that Shane's become
an engineer like you wanted
I also hope auntie Tracey and uncle
Brent are taken good care of Jacob in
Georgia akumal Lorraine and granddad Jim
still buying sweets it's grandma's
fridge pack more for with magnets as
auntie Catherine found her daggered for
her via blob Oh auntie Barbara is she
coping well with uncle Philip patent
away has auntie Deb wrong tangled her
Christmas lights on Laura and Kevin
doing okay and all the reason Andrew has
anti Yvonne still got to hate cypher
Frankie Cocozza has Charlie been
urinating on the carpet as Ellie and
Dominic being beaten each of the Rope
it's doing drain being a pensioner hee
hee
it's a knee aiming the baby doing okay
okay new paragraph well though we will
never see you to them again the memories
will stay in our hearts forever I also
have a request for the funeral good
everybody please come dressed in colors
or color of the rainbow I also want to
say how much I love my friends and
family lots and lots of love from really
PS are there flying cars yet okay
so that's a letter I'd get on these
crappy little scratchy pieces of paper
here that I thought were the best thing
ever at the time and okay I'm just going
to go ahead and explain some bits so the
first bit that was quite funny because
um so if I am lost I'm probably lost or
dead so you know just bring that up then
probably dead if not I'm lost
run away got lost and the thing is
reason why I've put so many people and
my family down like has Ellie and
Dominic being beat could beat each other
up and has anti bun so got I hate cider
Frankie Cocozza the reason I put
everyone down is because I felt so bad
on site ok so this is my guest letter I
have to include everybody I have to
include all members of my family in
there otherwise I'll feel sad and
they'll hate me even though I'm dead but
so I had to include every single person
in my family think of one little thing
that happened although I said in here
and where is it has auntie Catherine
found her damn involving yet I can't
even remember losing a diamond for me so
I don't know about that but all youth
once I can and also I know it whatever
you might be wondering who Frankie
Cocozza raised when I said I don't even
still got hate side for Frankie Cocozza
so basically in the UK and we have X
Factor or Britain's Got Talent I can't
member with 21 and what it's like
America's Got Talent is that the show
what it's called I'm not too sure I'm
Frankie Cocozza was a contestant and he
was like Justin Bieber Brad a lot of
haters but he had a lot of people that
loved him as well mainly girls and and
all the guys like him so I'm like in
verse one I thought it was an idiot and
so did my aunt Yvonne and I seem to be
the only one that didn't like him I
the so I just went along and explaining
everything and then I was like doing
jokes with everyone as antidote from
tangled hair Christmas lights and I've
got my Luanne and granddad still buying
sweets and then it's auntie Barbara
coping well with Uncle Phil like passing
away now I just thought that escalated
quickly it's suddenly talking about
losing a ring and then someone dying
it's like it's not a good thing but it
was just definitely escalated quickly
and and then at the end and so on the
left part is to enjoying being a peak
pension and then I thought I was
hilarious and then the choice was really
funny are there flying cars Ian I don't
know what I was expecting them to read
this because with what I reckon that the
year flying cars will be brought out is
like 2 1 1 12 that's my prediction so
yeah my mom's gonna be dead then and
every one of my family's going to be
dead at that point 100% dead apart from
my daughter Sean who what if all Grandal
whatever you know what I mean and so on
a flying party I don't really know what
I was talking about that one but yep
flying cars gonna be flying cars so
that's the end of the video that is my
funeral letter that I went when I was 11

know about it January there and if
