this has made an appearance because
basically I did a cooler one yesterday
got long to put in my hair and it hasn't
washed out properly so this is what
we're gonna have to deal with through
this video anyway on Wednesday I went to
go and see Vienna at play at Old
Trafford cricket ground and as you may
have heard on social media a certain
somebody named Drake came out and made
an appearance oh my god I cried it was
unbelievable because so unexpected there
was that kind of tension like I will he
appear and then he did I will get into
that later on in the video but before I
do start really quickly I want to say a
massive thank you to best fees for
sponsoring in this video if you never
heard of best fiends
it's a puzzle battle game app on the App
Store which is free to download it is so
addictive and you can collect characters
and build an army to defeat these looks
it's kind of hard to explain but you
should get an idea based off the
gameplay overlay I have playing at the
minute
there were also side quests based on the
most popular players I am on level 31 at
the minute and if you think you can beat
my score which hopefully you want you
can send me your results on Twitter
Instagram snapchat of comment them below
what level you are on and we'll see who
wins for this one link its of course in
the description please go and check them
out it is a really awesome app as you
can see by the amount of levels that
I've played on it in the matter of a few
days ok back to be honest so when we
arrived at the stadium Drake song -
plain Drake pop style was playing off
the top so whenever I heard that song I
get massive flashbacks even though it
was only on Wednesday and we were pitch
standing so we were stood up on the
pitch rather than seated around the
arena and also we witnessed a lot of
arguments and fights and people throwing
up on the pitch standing so that's
always interesting so she had two kind
of supporting artists on they were big
sean i love him he played some amazing
songs he was really good
and DJ mustard and then we add have made
an entrance so the way she and entered
the stadium while she was dressed in an
old white cloak with a hood up very
mysterious and the first song she
performed was stay I want to really like
about Rihanna it's actually has like a
lot of emotion when she sings a song I
don't have you seen it but when she
played that I think it was Wembley she
broke down when she was singing love the
way you lie part two and I don't know if
that kind of makes it a lot more you can
connect to them a bit more when the star
get emotional because you see him as
like a real person rather than an artist
that you've always seen from behind the
screen kind of thing if that makes any
sense at all so now I'm going to do a
quick overlay of some of the
performances that she did in this form
of her videos
so now for the moment that you've
probably been waiting for with this
Drake's entrance suddenly light as you
can see in the video people started
screaming so but like it very gradual
asur the like few screams and more
screams as more people realize and then
I was like looking around the screen the
stage where works I couldn't see
anything so I was relying on this
massive screen to show him if he was
there and then we looked at the big
screen and then out of nowhere before it
went showed his face or did it show his
face first I can't my weight came on
with his verse he sang his verse anyway
which was you know that you need to get
down down down down and work over that
bit you like came on and it you know his
little walk through always does when he
comes on and because I've seen videos
for him performing before hand everyone
when absolutely mental when he came on
and I couldn't believe it so he came on
here's the video
by the way just in case good know even
in JQ an official couple math after work
Drake was like can I do a little
something for a minute there and
everyone's like yeah it's like Rafa like
mental and and he performed one dance
I've got a video here
I go by the name of Jersey draping you
don't so you pull not as soon as it came
on I'm on the side grips on your waist
firm like that way like everyone was Oh
just it was such an amazing atmosphere
and that was that
yeah I I don't know how much detail I
got in there if I wanted I could go into
so much detail but the video would be
like 40 minutes long but it was
incredible Wow it was absolutely amazing
so yeah I hope you enjoyed my little
summary of the night just in case you
missed there and you wish you'd have
gone you might have got an idea what it
will like there so it was almost as if
you've been I hope you enjoyed this
video also please go and download best
fiends it is such a good app I just I
enjoy playing and I don't have a lot of
games on my phone but that when I
downloaded stopped playing and I was
like playing every minute that I could
then I could so yeah try and beat my
score on that hundred good day and don't
get stay positive
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
