tour video I've talked enough now this
is the outside of my room toward the
doorway I also have a doorbell here that
makes a most annoying sound when you
press it yeah I got that when I was
younger and I thought it was a fantastic
idea at the time but I hate it now I
absolutely hate it and my friends are
like oh what's this and they end up
pressing about six times very annoying
anyhow this is the overview of my room
so you've got my vanity here my chair my
bin my bed my drawers my mirror
windowsill wardrobe and drawers that I
store my clothes in so I know that um
the video quality is great for this
video but I'm using my phone because I'm
getting the Canon t3i but I had I've
given give away my other camera now so
this is my vanity area here I'll start
from this side here and this is like
just my bushes
and then I kind of hide my stuff behind
the mirror like shampoo body spray
deodorant and then I've got my mirror
here that I got from Argos and sunflower
headbands and all the flower headbands
are from eBay as well this drawer here
my vanity drawer is from MFI furniture
and it's just a great place to store my
makeup in this here is where I store all
my palettes so I've got my Naked 3
palette Naked 2 palette chocolate bar
palette Urban Decay electric palette and
and accessorized palette and then here I
store my Empire State Building tumblr
co-op that I guys like a souvenir from
going there in New York and then this is
some other stuff that I hid be I member
as well like dry shampoo fake tan and
then this here is where I store my MAC
lipsticks I've got 7 8 MAC lipsticks and
I store most of them here and then I've
got one in the other one and then I've
got the packaging for the chocolate bar
palette there here I have my favorite
quote in a poster
it doesn't like a very good poster like
that um boy it says we should all start
to live before we get too old
very stupid so I regrets and that's my
favorite quote of all time if I want to
do something but I'm like oh but what if
what if what if as like our stuff what
ifs just go and do it so this way I
stole the packaging for my Urban Decay
electric palette and this is my Mac
kinda a little bit my Mac stuff that I
just like to put on show so my me a no
lipstick foundation blush and lipstick
packaging at the back and then here in
these drawers is rest on my makeup so
that's all my face makeup all of my lip
products they're very messy now and then
I products everything if you do want to
see a full makeup collection video I've
already done one so you can go and find
it on my channel and then this here is
where I keep kind of my body sprays and
sentence and so it's a bit dark in there
but you can kind of see I've got some
body sprays all back there hair stuff
perfect
and then I've got a lighter at the back
that I use for candles not cigarettes
just gonna put that out there and a few
pallets there that I don't really use
then over here I have my chair so the
chair is from connacher member waits for
me something Internet on Google it's
really easy to find it's like an
s-shaped chair and then this pillow here
is from Asda you might be able to find
it at Walmart because Walmart bought us
there so there might be it might be
there as well and then this is a teddy
bear that I've had since I was a baby
and then my monkey seems to be giving it
a lap dance yeah not the best
positioning there then this wallpaper
here is from being cute from being q and
it's like Paris and then I've got some
shelves here that from eBay I also have
another shelf there but I've some
flowers in and it looks awful so I need
to change the flowers in there and the
flowers are from eBay as well and then
this here is my bed I have a single bed
and I kinda want a double bed but at the
same time I kind of think that a double
bed to make my room look really small
but all the pillows are from B&amp;amp;M home
bargains and then this duvet cover is
from aster as well so let's just
straighten it out a bit and it's like a
Paris one my room has a kind of Paris
theme but not really it's just kind of
coincidence more than anything then here
I have my lamp that I use to just at
night when I'm watching Gossip Girl on
Netflix I love it turned on and then
after I can just reach down and turn it
off again and then these these are some
flowers that I bought from a store as
well here I keep my belly rings so there
are the belly rings they're from eBay
and I know eBay bit dodgy but the from
actual shops that I've like kinda that
sell their products on eBay as well and
they're all three one 6l surgical steel
which is what I normally use so that's
in that and then the box I got from
holiday and I find them in quite a lot
of holiday resorts so if you go on
holiday next it you're probably able to
find it and then here I have my iPad and
phone and another belly bar that didn't
fit in so I can anchor dangly one
then you come to these drawers here and
then in the top I have my nail products
so I have a headband had two headbands
are they useful like when I'm doing with
people's makeups to push the hair back
and then I've got some false nails from
Primark that are amazing they're a pound
each but they're really good and then
some kind of swabs that I used to clean
my bellybutton piercing and then my nail
varnishes I've not got very good nail
varnishes to be fair but I've got a few
back fairly alright and then I have some
se ones here that I've got in a holiday
set some jewels some nail art pens clear
nail varnish nail art pen as well and a
sharpener to sharpen the pencils and
then this is like a random bits and bobs
store I think everyone has this drawer
and then here I have a knife the valley
the use for it's a bit pathetic but I'll
use it for self-defense and case on
breaks into my room which is not going
to happen but it's always there to have
it then case just in case nothing's
impossible and also I want to do a bit a
knife-throwing I'll just put there and I
don't have the proper knife throwing
knives Clanny to save up for them
they're about 60 pounds that's on eBay
as well and then I got some links every
body spray and then some smashed glass
and I don't know what to do with here is
my mirror that I forgot to dust so it's
very dusty sorry about that
and then I've got some hair stuff at the
top accessorize stickers that I put on
my mirror and then me hello um it's just
the mirror is from Argus as well and
then I have this body statue and this is
a picture of me and my dad me when I was
younger and then my dad holding me and
then I've got a genie lamp that I got
when I was abroad and then a family
picture that I've got it's like my dad
my brother's me and my mom but you can't
realistic so the water then I've got my
kind of the crappy jewelry that I have
that's not very good although there's a
few things on here that I really like
like this bracelet here and then quite a
lot of things that my friends have given
me that I like there but anything that I
bought by myself I'm not keen on and
then I've got like a few ornaments and
that's land then over there this is
where I keep most of my little bits and
bobs that I use for storage and then
this is where I keep my fishbowl that I
just put like makeup
and cream and stuff in that I have
another one of them kind of decorate
wall decorations that I showed you
before my telescope and my washing
basket then here I have my wardrobe and
my Sephora bag on top and then if I open
my wardrobe it's a bit messy in my
wardrobe but I've just got some clothes
and then jumpers on top and then my
shoes at the bottom they were in a nice
order but then I just bought too many
shoes so I just kind of throw them in
there now and then this is the last part
of my room I have a decorative bow on
the side of my ward job that will
actually came with pajama shorts but
they kept fall enough so I've put it on
my wardrobe now then this clock that's
from bnm and it was 5 pounds but it
looks more expensive than that but it's
not it's like a plastic material that's
not very good but it works it's all the
time that's all that I'm bothered about
then I have a fridge here that has
nothing in it because I ate everything
in there and drank everything hmmm that
was from Argus as well and then this is
from next it's just like a candle that
I'll light if M can be bothered too and
that's me my mom when I was younger in a
frame that I got from aster as well and
then this is a DIY like drink that I
made but it's got tissue paper inside
and glitter glitter forever 17 I think
that's a user name I did a tutorial on
it for Starbucks but I used to cost a
drink instead cuz I'm a rebel and then
I've got some the lady million perfume
there and some and then a trinket box
that has nothing in it right now
and some flowers here then you get to
the back of my door and I have the
onesies so that is my room if you want
