today's video which is very exciting for
me because I just purchased the iPhone 7
yesterday and I couldn't believe when I
managed to get my hands on one because I
went to Manchester went into John Lewis
and the only iPhones they had left of
the 7 was the iPhone 7 rose gold 32
gigabyte forwards the exact phone that I
wanted however I would have preferred
the iPhone flaws but that all sold out
and I was more than happy to have the 7
because previous to playing the phone I
was stuck with the 4s because and my 6s
got thrown in the sea and of the story
um so yeah I have great all set up now I
have the M tempered glass front screen
and also a case on the back so it's
really proof which means that it won't
be smashed hopefully fingers crossed
yeah adding to a very smooth transition
into the next clip so I'm going to
introduce it here is me in boxing the
iPhone 7 it was a fail I lost the other
footage this isn't the only snapchat I
managed to collect my snapchat is merely
t24 if you want to add up
I was very excited but I'm a bit done
with the box I was expecting for it to
reveal the phone straightaway or when I
open the box but there was a white piece
of cardboard over the top so it's very M
anticlimactic clam tip if you're
familiar with the iPhone 7 I'll go
through a few differences between the 6
and the 7 first of all a big one is that
the headphone jack has been removed from
the bottom which means that you can't
directly use your old earphones instead
you have to use an adapter so this is
the adapter dongle one side fits with
this kind of stand plug
snap and the other side is the lightning
adapter and which looks into the
charging port of your phone which means
you can listen to your old earphones
that way if you use this adapter another
thing you can do is buy the Apple
earpods
which are wireless earphones the slider
there for to that wire no wire Wireless
obviously but they are extremely
extremely old priced they are 160 pounds
and 160 dollars also the cameras have
been vastly improved the-- and that
camera on the iPhone 7 is actually 12
megapixels and the front camera is 7
megapixels I'm pretty sure just a vast
improvement from the iPhone 6 which was
like one point two megapixels so yeah
pretty good for places facing camera and
it's also not an f-stop at one point
eight which is the approval from the
last time with image stabilisation it's
got better battery life got stereo sound
as well coming out of these and also I
think the sound might come out of there
but I'm not always sure another thing I
noticed which isn't often mentioned is
that the phone I figure this out myself
after it kept coming on land away and I
couldn't figure out why you have it down
like that if you want to use it you
bring it up and it automatically
switches on you don't have to touch
anything
also it is what resistant but I it is
water-resistant but it's pretty much
waterproof and because I've seen YouTube
videos where people take it underwater
for an hour and absolutely no difference
to the phone so if you want to get some
underwater shots I'm pretty sure you can
get away with it but don't take my word
for it because I'm not hundred percent
so maybe keep waking water on second
cause I break every single one of our
phones but this one is my baby right now
absolute baby and I got a nice little
case on it as well from M II and it's
like a rose gold case that matches the
walls got foam okay so I'm going to do
it more in detail unboxing so you know
what you get in the box of the iPhone
okay so you've got your pretty standard
iPhone box but this one just says iPhone
doesn't have the number on the side the
seven and then when you open it you have
a little folder with things in it such
as apple stickers warranty things like
that um how to use the iPhone new
features and then of course you've got
the gorgeous iPhone 7 I've got the rose
gold one and it's pretty similar look to
the iPhone success but the antenna on
the back have been moved and completely
disappeared to the edges of the phone
and then here you have the Apple
earphones when I first opened the box I
thought that they were their air pods
and I got really excited but on the side
there is wire so it's very misleading
and I was absolutely gutted because I
thought I'd been lucky and then of
course you've got the adapter which
allows you to use your old earphones or
headphones with the phone and the
charging head and wire this standard
that you get with every iPhone and I'm
pretty sure that was everything in the
box and here's my phone case I'm
extremely proud of it I think it's
gorgeous I don't have much time to use
the iPhone 7 yet because I've had it for
one day however I did manage to take a
few pictures at the Transit Center
yesterday and the quality was amazing on
one of them this is a macaroon picture
and that I took at the chopper Center
yesterday and that was only snapchat
camera as well so the subject can
probably like the snapchat cameras not
as good as the normal camera so look at
that picture probably time to buy about
true in quality and you've got the
equivalent of the iphone 7 camera
absolutely amazing it is the exact same
size dazzling success as well before I
compared them both in the store and they
are absolutely identical okay now for
what's on my iPhone I'm very excited
what is on my iPhone not a lot you know
why because you can delete every app I'm
talking every Apple talking FaceTime
contacts no calendar clock anything that
you don't want at all tonight apps you
do want man you want to just delete you
can now delete them pretty much every
app bar like app store lab you can
delete iTunes I've deleted everything
more or less okay so when you open my
phone you first from across my lock
screen to unlock it use my thumbprint
and you pull out on to the main screen
and then I have the calendar top left
corner these ones I've kept on I have
photos I don't have a lot of photos at
all and then ones from my iCloud
advocacy then you go out onto camera and
then I have a folder dedicated to all
the apps that I couldn't bring myself to
actually delete Excel need to use at
some point but I don't want like messing
on the home screen so I put them all
away in an extras folder and then on the
next page I have facebook Instagram
messenger snapchat YouTube and YouTube
studio and then I have a duolingo to
help me with my Spanish and then music
and to listen to but I don't actually
use that I used 25 premium which in the
bottom right corner and I you must buy 5
premium highly recommend it for your
music lover and then I got higher
messages phone and Safari and yeah my
lot of my iPhone is not very interesting
at all yeah I don't even want to mess it
up with any apps but if you can with
this video and want to smell what was on
my iPhone to get maybe app download
ideas and I recommend gyrosphere for an
app you like control the vault subway
surfers I recommend from minecraft well
like if you ever want to just really
want a really long road jam you want to
go on your phone but you don't want to
use an app that are used any 3G or
anything but it will last you a long
time get minecrafting yet building a big
house
I recommend slithered io it's an
absolutely amazing game like if you want
something to fill the time but you do
need internet so I'm pretty sure I got
enough detail in
hopefully I hope this was okay if you
did enjoy it give it a thumbs up and
please leave a comment again save you
the light reading coins and good or bad
ah yep that's it
have a beautiful day and don't get safe
boston MA bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
