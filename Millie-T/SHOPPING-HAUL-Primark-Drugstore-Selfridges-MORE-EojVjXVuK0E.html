first place I went was Miss Selfridge I
have never ever in my life been to miss
Selfridges before but they were having a
buy one get one free on all sale items
now that is amazing like for one thing
all they have to say like them so that's
amazing as a whole it's like one thing
and then it's get one free so I would
say I went in there and they have since
only thing I picked up was this
beautiful a jumper from me Selfridges it
is kind of your average jumper but he
just get into darker color towards this
but if you can tell I don't have to come
we'll pick it up on her but I do
honestly love this so much Conseco stock
towards the bottom but I really do like
it and um I took they and tags off it
now because I filmed it and after I
showed he tried to have pulled the tag
off really annoying but I do know that
this was ten pounds and item I purchase
was 15 pounds so talking about before
the next item I purchased with this
pencil skirt for myself it just it's
quite sure and but it does go down to
about mid thigh and if you pull it up to
your waist and have any lovely t-shirt
bagging out there if you do that it
looks really beautiful so I also love
this thick waistband it has across here
so I instantly fell in love with this
and I obviously know I went to new look
and I only purchased two things so yeah
let's get that one over and done with
really quickly good sings fairly boring
a gray bean a which was five pounds next
I bought this t-shirt here it's got the
number 67 on it and I absolutely love
this t-shirts pollute my favorite
t-shirt all times just have a look at
that it's got really nice floral designs
on it and it's kind of property it's a
really good fair and it's got the number
67 in white kind of sheer what writing
if that makes sense and it's just the
fara patterns are gorgeous and I love it
so much and I have actually tried this
on tucked in with the pen
skirt and together they look absolutely
amazing
I went to Primark and I got this very
desk area bare first thing I bought was
this yeah a this kind of short holiday
dress and that looks like this
this would five pounds in the sale how
many thing is that and so if you just
have a look it is quite short but it's
got these lovely aztec tag designs
across this bit here and then it's got
some floral designs here and I just love
this so much and it looks excellent I
thought I this is also identical to the
one I just showed you but the colors are
a bit more obvious and it's a long dress
that goes down to your ankles and it's
really nice it's one of those really
tight ones that hugs you figure which
isn't very good in my case but it looks
like this it's really really nice and it
as I said before it goes down to your
ankles and this was seven pounds in the
sale no it was five pounds this is five
times in the sale as well and and I was
really really happy and it was a size
six
I'd say oh yeah this was five thousand
the sale down from ten pounds so that's
pretty good next I bought probably and
my favourite dress out of all of them
and it is black and white
lovely dress and it's got the floral
designs again I'm a sucker for floral
designs I love flowers especially with
this because joining TV kind of flickers
and it's like grey and lying and things
like that well that's what you can
patterns like within the patterns within
the pattern sort like I don't know if
you'll be able to tell on that but it's
just really nice and it's quite a high
neck so it's about there and it's got
black sleeves quite still kick and these
sleeves aren't the best quality material
but on the inside they feel fine but um
anyway the favorite thing that I bought
from Primark like that was my favorite
dress I bought from prama but this is my
favorite thing is this
gah fear do you see it well scarf I have
so little of this scar now actually this
isn't really from Primark I bought it in
the Primark store but they have like in
accessorised aisle
so it's kind of them accessorized I
guess you could say and this was five
pounds and you know next it's down to
the drugstore in my favorite place and I
bought some stuff okay so first of all I
bought another what is the ilaria
l'oreal infallible never fade inline
nude colored kind of eyeliner
highlighter and this has been waved
about on YouTube so much for your
waterline and I've tried it it's amazing
few waterline so I went out and bought
another one of course so that's what
that one looks like and this was in sale
and it was five pounds so I was happy
about that okay next I bought another
one of the Rimmel stay matte
long-lasting pressed powder I need to
stock up on these ooh so the best
powders ever and they are only four
pounds as well four pounds it is amazing
and I just love the powder really good
coverage and I'm a addict for full
coverage anything so I was real happy
with that and I also I didn't actually
buy these in this shopping trip
I bought them like couple of shopping
trips ago like last week something like
that it wasn't that long ago actually
I'm probably a bit bit longer than last
week I don't actually know when I bought
these but it wasn't too long ago that I
did include them and I bought two sleek
bushes they were five pounds in each of
four pounds ninety five or four pounds
75 something like that and I got they
call a rose gold which I will show you
now gorgeous color like that if I just
it's really good pigmentation and it's
the way you evens out and blends out to
match your skin tone it's gorgeous and I
also love the packaging because it's
really small and it's good for just kind
of putting in your makeup collection and
facing upwards like that and then either
what I bought was a this one is in the
color pixie pink and I have actually use
this and
and it's really really good now okay so
this is the one in fix pink my favorite
color I love pink blushes pixie pink
nine three six and they find just swatch
a bit of that for you really gorgeous
pink color so that's everything I bought
yeah the second sleep blush I bought
Thursday we're having a tooth the nine
pound steel on the rim l BB cream and
stay matte liquid mousse foundation so
of course I brought to them and I got to
these I've never actually tried a mousse
foundation before I do have the
Maybelline and kind of dream mousse
foundation but it's any shade to dog but
it it was a shade a little bit too dark
so I think actually used to yeah it's
gonna be for when I tan in the summer
obviously I have to go abroad for that
but it was 1049 and the normally eight
pounds I think I don't even know why
that was one pounds 49 a must have been
an error but it's just like I bought it
was the last one on the shelf so
obviously everyone else noticed it was
amazing
so they were massed in London matte
liquid mousse foundation like that and
then I got the BB cream beauty bar
I've got the BB cream beauty balm and in
light and it's also SPF 15 which you
can't really go wrong with then finally
from superdrug I bought this female
eyebrow pencil because I need another
eyebrow pencil because I bought the
benefit eyebrow pencil it was 15 pounds
it was really good and the product
itself is really good but it goes down
and uses up so quickly I've only had it
for about a month and I've already used
like 3/4 of it and I'm really
disappointed with that I did not get my
money's worth of it but the products
itself is really good but this one
doesn't seem to be going down a lot and
I was really and I was really really
happy about that so as you can tell I've
only used it and because obviously I
have to I have to try it out since I
bought it and so in the hall I think say
it's not very good or it's good and this
was three pounds
eyebrow pencils are quite cheap finally
I went to Selfridges and I bought two
things okay so it wasn't in this
shopping hold it was a couple of shops
with built and before that where I got
the sleep what blushes but I got the
benefit rockatuer blush whoa
I this has been this have been made
about on YouTube so much so I decided
that I would give it a go try it out and
it's really good
but the push it comes with it's not good
so you have to use I have to use my own
pushes for that I don't understand with
these companies when did you know when
you buy a soda pallets and they include
those crappy little eyeshadow
applicators that you just been that I
don't do just why don't we just save
money and VIN them the only palette that
I've ever owned that comes with a really
good brush is naked 2 &amp;amp; 3 palette they
were really good I'm the naked face and
the naked 1 palette I don't have to make
it basics and blush
fried them on up but I don't know but
anyway I also got the this steel F lip
glaze set and this was from the steel a
website but I decided to include in and
you could find it himself in yourself in
Selfridges back buddy I can't believe it
it was a winter set you get eight lip
glazes for 16 pounds that's like 2
pounds each and that is really really
really good a pack of three is 12 pounds
and this one the packs of three to were
sold out this one wasn't even sort out
yeah and that was amazing I think it was
because he wanted to get rid of its it
was the winter edition but I bought that
and I was amazed at the price and if you
