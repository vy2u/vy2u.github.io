today's video it's going to be a
storytime the most traumatic story time
that I'll probably do on this channel
it's also going to be the last story
time because my life isn't interesting I
haven't got a lot to say but if you
enjoy this video as you are watching it
or if you're enjoying it so far please
press the subscribe button stick around
because there'll be hopefully more
videos to come in the future that you'll
like - lets go into the story I hope you
enjoy it and also I want to hear your
most embarrassing experience so please
leave us a comment below so this all
took place at year 9 camp this is quite
a while ago but at the end of year 9 we
got to golike camp with the whole year
and there were obviously teachers
students and there were some sick
formers all at year 13s there as well so
there was quite a range of Ages and it
was just a really good time we went out
we did kayaking team-building we did all
sorts and also to celebrate the last
night at camp we had a party in a
marquee for the whole year so obviously
us being girls we all got very dressed
up because that's just what girls do and
I needed a shower because I hadn't
showered in two days because I do not
want to use those showers at all they
look disgusting but anyway I built up
some courage and I went in the shower
and I used it and it was the other floor
was disgusting it was like dirty when
you're like that's just not what you
want to stand in anyway afterwards I got
Jasmine to an outfit and I wore a black
top with your policy were wearing videos
it had a sleeve here cutout shoulder and
then it went down like that slide you
can see this part shoulder and then I
took that into a white skull this is
actually the score that it was um short
you hear it was probably misguided I a
little bit I got another one this is me
when I got home I bought another one
that actually worked so I'll show you it
now this is the score just simple plain
white score and at the back it has a zip
so you can see these zip normally you
know just normally goes up but when it's
not fastened like it does it goes all
the way down your bum like all the way
down so keep that in mind when I'm
telling you this disastrous story so I
get ready in the bathroom I do my hair I
do my makeup I get dressed I'm feeling
pretty good you know just got dressed
know how girls do you know you feel
feeling pretty confident so I walk out
and it's like this just outside toilets
there's quite a few year thirteen guys
so I'm like walk past normally no not a
problem
and then I was walking off and a hearse
and I heard some light laughing from
behind me and I was like oh you know
laughs having a bit of banter whatever
you know I wasn't I don't think anything
of it I keep walking and then I keep
hearing like a few a few giggles and
stuff but I don't think anything of it
you know so go back to the ten and I see
my back and my two best friends that
were on the trip there I'm like and I'm
like hanging another thing oh you look
nice you're exchanging compliments and
such and then I look at this fence there
was three guys from my year as well
backs would become quite close to them
and listen this trip so we were like all
having a chat there and then we decided
to walk back down to the light Marky
said where the party was taking place my
two best friends or first or they're
walking in front of me and then I'm
talking I'm talking to the boys as if
like say you're one of the guys I'm
talking to you like having a
conversation then I turn around and I
walk off so I had my back to them and
I'm walking for about ten seconds then
when I heard this I hear one one of the
guys go like this um melee if you've got
a bit of a even you've got a bit of a
situation with the zip so I'm like oh
it's not that much of a big deal it's
probably just not done all the way up
it's fine so I reach behind me to do it
all and I feel this huge hole what
happened was when I zipped up the skirt
I felt the zip go up because technically
it didn't go up but didn't catch on to
the other side so only one side actually
zip top so when I felt that it go up it
did the zip at all it must have caught
on the top because it was like that
massive haul so you could see everything
was devastated I was distraught that was
the only thing I brought to you and I'd
come everything else I'd brought like
sweatpants and to be fair I would have
been down for going to sweatpants in the
party like I would have been sold for it
but I don't think everyone else would
have appreciated it and all my friends
wanted me to get dressed up obviously
suits what girls do so I'm guys guys can
get dressed up as well so then do two
guys like Wallace Wallace of what no
ever acting very perverted but I think I
were just curious I'm not too sure so
I'm like Kirsty Gibeah yeah that was
obvious it goes through one of them so
she comes behind me she puts her arms
around it so I'm like pressed up against
like that and we're waddling back to the
tent because if I could not do anything
someone had to go behind it because if
not I would have just showed up Sean
show everything to end everyone so once
my stick was down I'd walk path
practically the whole year going back up
to my field sixth formers year
Thirteen's you know teachers student
that's what they're all giggling out so
we go back to the ten and I'm saying to
curse him like what the hell do I do now
I want to go to this party is gonna be
great like it wasn't like a raging party
or anything but it was so good in the
end inaudible party on everyone with
dancing it's like a huge like rave in
the middle it was it was really really
good I really enjoyed it anyway
Alan the situation at the moment was
that I needed to wear this score so I
had to call one of the teachers in the
end and she eventually did it over the
safety pins but throughout the whole
night I kept checking I kept like
feeling around every like two seconds
just to make sure that they hadn't you
know popped one of these safety pins we
had in but all here was a trauma text
you know what telling it back it doesn't
seem like it was so embarrassing but it
was it was really really embarrassing
side walk past so many people that had
seen it scarred me it really good
disguise
anyway that is the end today's third
time guys I did get a new one in the end
so this is my new one and I wear it
quite a bit I absolutely a little bit
and it fits really well I'll insert some
pictures anyway so yeah I hope you
enjoyed it if you did enjoy it please
give this video a thumbs up and also
stick around by subscribing
they might view some more story time
videos from her future independence if
anything interesting happens that is all
I have to say for now have a great all
day
Dolf get stay positive my bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
