back to my channel today we have a
different background we have a Christmas
tree because it's the 13th of December
which means there is 12 days until it's
Christmas this is my Mac horror story or
my bad experience at Mac can I just say
that I absolutely love Mac I have been
to Mac more times than I can even
remember and the staff there have always
been so nice to me it's just every now
and again like with any job you'll get
is the odd worker or employee that won't
be so nice to you so this was one of my
experiences also whilst you're watching
this if you realize that you actually
like this video and you maybe like my
personality
please plus please press that subscribe
button and comment any of your
experiences you might have had at Mac's
I'm actually interested to hear them so
this all took place at Manchester
Airport because in this Airport there is
a duty-free shop which basically means
to everything in there is cheaper I
think it has about 20% off and in the
makeup section was a Mac stall and when
I say a stall it is a stall it's tiny
so I go into this MAC store because I
wanted a nude lipstick I still don't
have a nude lipstick but I needed help
finding one at the time because what I
find with noodle lipsticks is that a lot
of them can make your skin tone look
very very washed out so I need help with
that so I walked over to these system
and there were two employees there and I
don't know what the names were so I'm
just going to call and refer to them
through blonde and brown the woman that
served me had blonde hair so ended up
serving me out for a while so go over to
them and these two girls are having a
conversation and I don't know what the
conversation was about but it seems to
be pretty good friends and I said excuse
me
and I waited for about two seconds and
then this woman the blonde one turned
around a moment look me up and down on
one moment so I was like all she just
looked me up and down maybe it was an
accident maybe she just wanted to see
what I was wearing not gonna judge you
by that I didn't have a clue what she
wanted the moment for until she turned
around and carried on a conversation
with a friend that was the moment you
needed it was at the start so just like
that was weird and not very professional
but you know what is fine I'm not too
bothered about that and so she couldn't
so then she turns around and goes what
do you need and I just said I just need
help choosing out a nude lipstick
because a lot of them are fine don't
suit me very well so I need to find like
the perfect one so she was like okay so
then I kind of we kind of walk over to
where they're like offset shelves of MAC
lipsticks are and she points to the row
of lipstick I've already seen them
obviously but she points the row of nude
lipstick samples which one do you like
and I was I was thinking I need you to
have a look at them all put them on me
swatch them whatever you want to do to
find out which one is good for me that's
what I thought I didn't say that it
wasn't good a good moment to start
saying things like that and I've decided
to said politely I'm not too sure I just
want to find one that doesn't wash from
outer skin tone so then if she makes me
think that I've said it wrong like
washing out your skin tone can't happen
cuz you goes alright okay and then oh it
sounds like oh she picks up the nude
lipsticks in the row one by one it goes
I just starts comparing notes and my
lips like that like my skin tone and for
about five times all these different
nude lipsticks and then she gets to and
she goes these ones look alright which
one do you want it's a living trust her
opinion it's just that she was been a
bit of a rude person to me so I was not
too sure that she wanted to had my best
interests in a way so I just said as
politely as I can
yet those two look nice am i okay to go
and try them on to choose which ones
that I want and she went you want to put
them on your lips and I said yeah you
have that sanitization spray that means
I can use them right and she goes I know
how to do my job Thanks and I didn't
mean it like that
and that was so obvious and I've been
meaning like that like just confirming
that maybe they have them that maybe I
can use them because if they don't then
that's fine I'll go somewhere else and
try them on there so at this point I was
kind of done with this woman but I was
just you like I'm gonna get my lipstick
and leave so I was just trying to ignore
her but anyway she'd share to get
inspiration lipstick wipes it with the
tissue gives me the lip to lip sticks
and I walk over to the mirror and this
is still in a small stall obviously and
the mirror is like so she was serving
here and the merci like here facing
outwards like that and then her friends
there so I'm in the middle in a way and
then the blonde who Surma me is he had
the brunettes there so I go over to the
mirror and I just start trying them on
as I'm doing this in the mirror she
laughs oh I don't s like a giggle but
like a scoff she scoffed in a way but in
a laughing manner so the blonde one
looks to the blue brunette because I
could see this exactly I was looking at
the reflection in the mirror as I was
looking here I could see the blonde one
here and the brunette there they were
and the blonde one looks she knew that I
could see it as well it was so obvious
with these mirrors here and then so I'm
fighting on this lipstick and then as
I'm doing
the blonde woman looks to the brown
haired woman and goes and the brunette
woman
I didn't even properly see what she does
to my eye oh just like this I'm
completely done that I was done before
but now I'm gone done and I don't know
if this is 100 definite but I'm pretty
sure that they earn Commission on when I
buy a product they get like a certain
percentage of what I bought that's like
commission in a way I didn't want to
give these women anyone because they
didn't deserve it and I could buy the
lipstick online I could buy in another
store I could go to another stall in the
duty-free shop and find something else
so am I turn around I just go you know
what I'm not too keen on these snip Lube
lipsticks I don't think I suit them and
I feel home like right fine
and take them away and put some backin
up at the end no no that's not the end
she goes so you don't want them and I
say and no I don't really seem to suit
these shades of nude lipsticks and she's
like okay so is that it you're gonna go
now jilted friend and their friend
laughs again be happy well this is the
other French you laughs and just just do
succinct annoying stuff laughing back
from behind me and I've done I'm not
even being biased in telling this story
so I turn around and I like to avoid
drama but when someone knows me I don't
I can't just not say anything because in
my opinion if you don't say anything
it's never resolved so I turn around to
the brunette one and I just saw sorry is
everything all right
and this brunette woman just goes just
bitches on until bashing the ones like
Sean to place do any hate so really like
look at everything like she owns the
place
this is one of those moments so she was
down with two lime juice when after I
said that remark she didn't say
and carried on washing the buttons so I
turn around match the blonde that was
serving me and I just said to work yeah
I'm gonna go looking for the store now
and then she just doesn't say anything I
don't even give a chance to do it I just
walk away and the cherry on the cake as
I'm walking away I've been willing to
put 90 percent of my life on the fact
that this blonde woman said to the
brunette woman I don't even know what
order it was I couldn't tell the voice
but they just whispered they went and I
didn't say anything I was too far out of
this stall because I was going to hurt
one of these girls in a minute they
didn't shut the hell up and so I was
just walking out there I went to find my
mom she was in the alcohol section as
always and I told her all about it I
feel like when a younger girl goes into
a stall the thing that she's just gonna
have a look around look at things like
oh I wish I could have that lipstick and
oh I wish I could have the eyeshadow and
actually buy anything despite that all
the other experiences I have had in like
I've been amazing they've been really
really helpful and I've always come out
with something that I like I really hope
