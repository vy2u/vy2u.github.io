on and to Catherine with her own face
mask on what the face mask is supposed
to do which is turn blue and me with the
face mask on so I'll just pick tell you
what the first two things they said we
were isolation BB cream feelgood factor
and the second one which might is my
most used one that I've used most so far
no clocks allowed deep pore detox mask
right now so the first review I'm going
to do is on the translucent BB thing Oh
BB cream is um what you apply is it do
well cleansed face and neck and on the
back of your hands and then you put your
legs on top of it
right similar do you like it make a base
well obviously I'll have it so I'm going
to review this phone the first thing
that I noticed about the packaging is
this here it's like a really nice
material like if you leave you they like
believes imprints and if you can see
what I mean like until evidence in there
that can't yeah but it fats out the type
of material and it's such good quality
actually feel the amount of quality on
it I can even hear it good quality no I
just love the packaging this works it's
simple what colorful at the same time we
got pinks and you got greens the BB
cream on to your skin and it is a nice
kind of
cream color complete the cream obviously
because it's BB cream suck meant to be
like anything else you can get into it
but this one is just normal so a plane's
BB cream feels nice and cool on my skin
it glides on my skin so easily and
effortlessly
it feels really light on my skin it
feels as if there's nothing on there as
well
it does have a nice shine to it but some
people don't really like the shine bit
so I'm going to apply some makeup to get
rid of it as you can see some of my
forehead and let's see if the makeup
does get rid of the shine if it doesn't
I'll be really impressed actually I
haven't tried using the makeup to cover
it up as I've just tried as a base as
some people use it to just cover up
their paws and cover up any
imperfections
apart from spots and pimples and things
like that that they may have such as big
claws so as you can see here I am going
to soon start applying my Rimmel match
perfection blusher as well as my junior
Danny foundation I do keep talking to
the camera but I did that last minute
decided to a voiceover so I'm using an
Ecotools brush as well to a player and
let's see how well the shine goes
because I actually practically gun and
what might my makeup feel is another
when I put foundation and powder on my
skin feels dry because actually drives
just under the pigment from the powder
but that cream
Wow I guess I just really my friend over
top of that it just feels completely
smooth like the other things I think
you'd want to apply the powder and
foundation over the top you just feel so
smooth and soft so before you have
formed a brilliant product there
definitely definitely the glows almost
gone by doing life don't want the girl
to go then you just use the foundation
but
nothing about his SPF 25 now that is a
high SPF so if you want holiday you can
just apply that instead of some cream
and it will cover your pores and things
like that what now is part of my with
you I'm going to read out what some of
the public have to say so it's just not
just my opinion quickly another thing I
liked about this product it feels so
light you just don't feel like I've got
anything on if I want to put the BB
cream on and I were to put the say
Foundation and powder on together if I
would be able to feel the part up there
because when you put makeup on you can
feel the products there most of the time
if not then you have a really good
product but when the BB cream on
underneath it I might forehead feels
really light it just it does it feels I
can't tell if there's anything there and
it doesn't even look like it and the
refused 4.45 now that is pretty good
review because members of the public are
very very precise if there's one little
little thing so for instance like that
oh they don't like the black stripes
said they'll complain about that and
knock off 5 stars for that so leaving it
with no stars but 4.45 guys a really
good review and that's how a 17 review
so I'll go through some of them and
little extracts with them now I do know
that BB cream is obviously supposed to
moisturize your face like that but I own
quite a I'd say I own about 10 and just
feeling this it's one of the softest I
have right now with the product on top
of it now it's kind of amazed at how
amazingly soft it made my skin feel so
I'm sorry I keep going on about it I
think this is going to be my new
favorite BB cream last for definite
anyway are we the reviews a lot of
people are saying about it is absolutely
amazing so block a one to one that meets
40 degrees and their skin is completely
protected so guys a very good thing
specially says SPF 25
I thought I put in this like screenshot
to share my beauty with everyone but
I've become obsessed with the smell now
so I apologize with / - girl OH
whenever I smell things I always stop
they smell do smell really nice I didn't
use it for all three times what it is
prone to allergic reactions a few
reviews have said that they have pimples
broke out on their face and then when
stopped utimately went away again
well obviously they hydrate allergic to
reaction to the product so you'll you'll
AB allergic reactions to a lot of
products so you're going to test an
experiment such a perfume smell book
such a strong lady
probably naturally gentleman actually
someone I've made it to start now that
is harsh two stars light heart they said
it peels and flakes off once it's been
on for 10 minutes however there has been
a bit of controversy where other people
said no it doesn't know that's not what
you're talking about it makes the skin
feel lovely and soft you need the
tiniest amount for your whole face and
neck so it lasts ages yes this is a
product that embarrassed us in the
pictures of the star but this smells
amazing ok I just gotta smell it now
hi smells like mint put a toned-down
minute with herbes it's amazing it
smells so good this is the part where I
go on about the smell by the way warning
don't you love this cute screenshot one
thing you do have to shake it before you
use because I forgot to shake it and
when I put it into my hand loads of
water came out so I was like great and
it just it does work a lot barely need
any product at all and it will cover
your whole face although it isn't thick
so don't expect your whole face turn
white you just take it kind of turns
into a sheer white which isn't too bad
because obviously it's very thin so it's
not too thick and you use it once a week
it says so that obviously means that
they all has to do quite a long time
even though I've used it about three
times just for the review and then my
auntie's have used it as well massage a
great sized dab of no plugs allowed onto
your face now I play on the face I like
it felt amazing cooling sensation on my
face but if you don't live it can't blew
on my side - a side of my face back
Isaac taken up a fast assembly now I got
you into this because you it kind of
cools and tingles
if anyone has the eos minute lip balm or
the sexy mother pucker by soap &amp;amp; Glory
again and you will know that you feel
like you're tingling cooling sensation
on your lips and this is what it feels
like but across your whole face deflate
like I said before a lot of times dry
skin don't use it it's as simple as that
really I'm fine stop I will love this
product really works on the skin
recommend this to anyone
look this tree to myself a couple of
weeks ago and I've used it twice so far
first time my skin felt smooth and
porcelains my makeup glided on so much
better the next day
yes after you use it and wipe it off
your makeup glides on so much better it
feels as if like a baby school my chair
fall across here okay I should be using
for example it feels as if like heaven
is kind of glided across your face and
left it really soft and you make it
which is kind of like glide so long it
like ice skating that's not a good
example a boy just leaving nice aroma to
your face and it just smell it when you
smell it it just felt nice when you
smell it straight out of their packaging
the packaging is just kind simple but I
do look the color as I said before so I
would do my highs I recommend these
products and I would honestly honestly
say that you should get these because I
forgive this really bad with you what
difference would it make if I made it by
the review because I thought if you're
gonna ask them back well they can't be
water but
they are quite pricey but not for what
you get you get your money's worth
definitely and get your so gone so
forego your website feel good back to BB
cream no poops about detox masks and you
will find get fire and move it simple
