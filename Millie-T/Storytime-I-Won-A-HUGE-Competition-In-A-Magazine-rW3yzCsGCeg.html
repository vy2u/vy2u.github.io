walk in and after about they had like a
little heel but after about three
minutes I feel were aching had to take
him off and walk barefoot in the streets
of London because I'm classy like that I
actually did that through the weekend in
Manchester though hello everyone it's
Millie and welcome to end of the story
time video the last one I did was about
a horrible experience I had at MAC
Cosmetics and you really enjoyed that
and you wanted to hear more story times
and this story is the one that came to
mind first and it's all about the time
that I want a competition in a magazine
it was a pretty big competition like the
biggest one that ever had so I had an
amazing time and it was so so great so I
hope that you enjoy listening to the
story don't expect me to like one cars
and like a new house it wasn't anything
like that I was 10 at the time this is
the kiddies magazine but we are pretty
good time as you're watching this video
if you enjoy it and you want to hear
more story times please press that
subscribe button I'm pretty sure if
you're watching like that it's there I
think that's where the subscribe button
is please press that subscribe button
and also give this video a thumbs up if
you enjoy it this competition was called
me in a million and it was the best
friend competition that I ended up
entering with my best friend at the time
called Geoff and it was in gold girl
magazine I'm pretty sure they have it in
most countries but I know in the UK it's
pretty popular like if you're into teeny
preteen magazine caltech kind of things
then you'll probably heard a gold girl
especially in the UK because it's one of
the more popular ones which is why I
bought it every single weekend because I
absolutely loved her I was in the car
doing my casual thing just looking
through the magazine and I came across a
competition and said it was the biggest
competition that they had ever had and
it was stupid best friends and at the
time I had got pretty close with a girl
called Jess and we were like best
friends and she lived very close to me
so I was like we might as well do the
competition and I never ever enter
competition so I don't know why I was so
so drawn to doing his competition and as
I was thinking shall we enter this I got
a knock on the car window so I looked
over and it was Jess because her mom had
gone to a store as well and she saw me
in the car and she was like hi so I was
like hi try to do this competition so
she was like yeah sure so we went back
to my
and did the necessary things to enter
the competition and these were first of
all you have to design a 2d handbag so a
handbag drawn onto a piece of paper and
you had to design it it's like a best
friend's handbag or like a handbag of
any design but we just decided to go for
like a bestfriend theme so we took
pictures printed them out stuck them on
either side of the handbag added pearls
and you know bubble writing and we had a
huge blank spot in the middle so I
literally sellotaped
pearls on it that were like part of a
handbag that I had when I was younger
along with this handbag one of you had
to write a poem for the other so I wrote
a poem for Jess then a few days later we
checked your voicemails on our phones it
was flashing red Sam we had a voicemail
and it was the manager of God girl she's
called Chloe saying what she was like
hey yeah you've congratulations Jess and
Malia's you have 1b mate and a million
competition please call me back and I
will give you all the details of your
prizes so at this point I was like
hyperventilating I was like oh my god so
we collected our prizes and these prizes
were number one a trip down to London
and a photoshoot number two an iPod Nano
like a square one and that was pretty
cool like that was a big deal in 2010
remember like iPhone 6s s weren't a
thing so they were they were pretty new
and then also a kind of flip camera so
it was like a pink and white camera
rectangular Capet camera that you
pressed a button and a USB stick flipped
out of it so it was easy to connect to
your computer and everything also fifty
pounds to spend a new-look when we went
down to London and a few other things as
well but I can't remember them off the
top of my head so our parents were like
happy for us so we all got on a train
down to London with crimps hair this was
definitely 2010 me I'm I'm ashamed so
anyway we also I think they mailed us
the iPod and the flip camera or unless
we got it when we
when I'm not too sure how it works but
we also then went out and we got
pancakes and these are like the biggest
pancakes we've ever seen in the work
this wasn't part of the prize but we
just decided to make a day out of being
in London so these pancakes were pretty
huge and it absolutely amazing my hair
was still crimped and still in a half so
I'm still ashamed of that and then I
can't really remember how we spent the
rest of there but I just remember that
we went out from meal the next day we
went to the photo shoot now it was a
photo shoot was a big deal like it was
the first one I'd been to like I'd never
been to a photo shoot before this so I
was like I was like freaking out and
then they were doing our hair and makeup
and I'd never had my makeup done like
that before like all foundation so I was
like sat there and I was looking at my
mom like what you're gonna do about it
kiss you will only wear foundation so
that we went on to you like the typical
white she like kind of photo shoot
looking area like that you stand in
front of and we posted loads of
different outfits and I have some reason
thought we've got to keep these outfits
but now looking back they were all
sponsored from brands so in a way they
kind of got off easy with us because
instead of having to erm pave models to
come in and like wear the clothes they
could just say hey it's quite you
winning the competition because it kind
of worked out for both of us they didn't
have to pay anything but we enjoyed the
photo shoot as it was so that was pretty
cool
and also for this photo shoot they used
candy green screen effect to make it
look like we're in different places so
the different places we had one in Paris
another taken in London another in
Hollywood and another end of the Alps
obviously we weren't there but they just
like replace the background so the photo
shoot was really fun and also they
interviewed us so they were asking us
things as like a best friend because the
winners page it was like a spread on how
to be in May in a million so they asked
us things like how do you to stay really
good friends what are the top five
things you like to do together and I was
like so we said well I have a sleepover
make videos together do gymnastics in
the garden go on a shopping trip and
give you a BFF a cool hairdo and I just
remember we had to sweep after
everything we said we like to do
together
they were like but we can't put that in
the magazine because we were seeing them
we were like they said so would you like
to do his friend Zoe said well we like
to play knock a door run and like prime
calls as well this hits it we're we
can't put that in the magazine they also
took pictures of us to use in the next
issue so the next issue was kind of a
christmas-themed one so I was holding on
my picture like three stacks of presents
I it was like pink blue pink and that
was taken on the photo shoot doing they
used it for some kind of like DIY
present design and I remembered Jes also
got another part in a page where she was
holding a Christmas card like a
Christmas card section at the side of
the page another thing that we did was
we went to the go girl like area where
they edit the magazines we took a look
around the place and met the manager and
just so everything worked we met the
whole team and that was pretty fun and
we got to see all the entries as well
and they was like there was like five
hundred entries something like that
which it's quite a bit when you think
about it so I think that is more or less
everything that we did but another thing
we got gift baskets when we arrived from
gold girl which was so unexpected I
thought I was really nice on little
things like that we do and I remember
being jealous of Jason because she got
like a too full of battles and they
weren't like expensive the light little
kitty like colorful bath salts that like
we all probably had it when we were
younger and we went shopping in the new
lot by the way which I think just and
looking at like 10 items like pop again
and money's worth out there and I think
I've got a pair of shoes and a t-shirt
with 50 quid cos I was just I really
wanted a new pair of shoes I put on
these shoes afterwards and we're walking
and after about they had like a little
heel but after about 30 minutes I feel
were aching had to take them off and
walk barefoot in the streets of London
because I'm classy like that
I actually did that through the weekend
in Manchester though that was everything
that happened that was everything we got
we still have the flip phone and iPod
Nano I think I stole the iPod Nano in
the end though because I have an iPhone
so it wasn't really much need for it but
