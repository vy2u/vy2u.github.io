we're just gonna leave it hi everyone
how are you
and today I'm gonna be doing this group
down challenge I said that I was gonna
do out my last video I've been say I'm
gonna do it for awhile actually I was
like as soon as I hit million I'm gonna
do a stripped-down challenge because
just so you guys can feel like you know
me a lot more and you get to know a more
personal side to me and just basically
it's a little life update as well
because my life is changing recently and
I'll tell you more about that once I've
set the timer I literally just started
doing the challenge and swore like five
times in one minute and then realized I
couldn't bleep it so let's die again
right it started now so as I was saying
for the third time that time looking I
have an announcement
so I've already now set my social media
on my vlog channel but not on this
channel yet I'm moving to London
tomorrow I'm moving out of home I'm
moving out from home so right now I'm 17
and I live with my parents obviously all
my mom my stepdad and my two
stepbrothers
but tomorrow that changes because I want
to be living in London in a house in
like central London so that's different
interesting new I'm going to moving in
with Spain and Spencer who am I to
really really close YouTube friends and
the reason why we're all moving is
because London is where we all need to
be because that's where everything to do
with YouTube is you know all events
business meetings opportunities always
in London I mean and LA but if you it
was between LA and London and at 17 and
think I'm gonna stick with London for
now maybe I'll move to LA in a few years
or not we'll find out in a few years hmm
so the reason why I'm so excited to move
out is because living up here I'm so out
of it like you got the UK London like
the heart where YouTube is just
everything happening to do with YouTube
and then you've got like me just kind of
like on the outskirts like I'm not one
kid in high school with no friends like
that's how I feel so I'm very out there
so I by moving into London I am will my
mindset is gonna change I'm so excited
because living over here recently has
just kind of put my mind got got me a
little bit demotivated with YouTube not
do you motivated in the sense I lose
passion for X I will never ever or I
probably will
but not nowhere in the near future the
loot I know out in the like next few
years I can't see myself losing any
passion for YouTube because I love it so
so much so I not demotivated in that
sense demotivated in the sense that I
don't know what to film cuz over here
you know living at home I'm very limited
to what videos I cannot know I'm not
really really really limited but there's
a lot more ideas I personally would want
to do once I move out that I can do so
once I move out this channels gonna
change a lot cuz right now I'm kinda a
lot of the videos that I do a clothing
videos I love doing clothing videos but
I'm always scared to do too many because
I don't want my channel to just be known
for clothing so that when I load another
video which is like personal maybe Q&amp;amp;A
or even like a prime video or whatever I
don't want it to get to the stage where
it gets no views cuz everyone that's
subscribed subscribe for clothing videos
yeah if that makes sense so when I move
down to London my content is gonna
change a lot I'm gonna do less clothing
videos I'm still gonna do some clothing
videos because I really really enjoy
filming them obviously that's why I do
them in the first place but at the same
time I'm going to also do different kind
of thing series so I want to do a
paranormal series where I go to London's
most haunted hotels with like oh my
youtube friends you know can't me Lewis
Ben Spencer Jordan and we all like film
there and see actually Jordan would not
come with me to that nevermind he
wouldn't you would not catch him dead
like dead like finding ghosts or
anything like that but I mean whoever
would want to come would come and I also
have a lot more series planned out that
I'm not gonna talk about just in case
it's someone another youtuber takes my
ideas before I film them that sounds so
stupid but it actually happens it sucks
but it happens so I'm gonna like keep it
quiet until I'm even and start doing
them so this channel I think mainly what
it's gonna be is there's gonna be an odd
video every now and again like random
but mainly it's gonna follow like a
series so like the paranormal series and
then other kind of style series I have
on different days of the week every few
weeks or every like yeah he'll make
sense once I meet valuel see happening I
don't even know Sully solidly in my own
head what I'm doing and but yeah like I
think that made me so why I'm sad to
move out is just like leaving my mom
because she is like
I'm so so close to my moment we have
such a close relationship and a lot of
you guys do obviously not my mom from my
flocks and she's in a lot of my main
channel videos as well and you really
like her which is really cool because I
kind of like my mom as well so leaving
her is gonna be quite I'm not leaving
her because I'm gonna come back up you
know because my room is gonna stay at
the same so I can come back home
whenever I want to just majority of the
time I am gonna be living in London
because that's gonna be my home so
leaving her is gonna be kind of sad and
I'm gonna miss her looks as I said be
really close and I literally I spend all
day every day with her basically because
she doesn't work as well anymore and
she's like retired um and that's
something that kind of lead run from
what I was knew that I was gonna say
talk about in this video but I'm kind of
scared to do it um so it's do my mom and
I feel really awkward talking about this
because I don't tell people this because
it's awkward to talk about and I don't
like that interaction I don't like I
don't mind them knowing at all like not
at all it's just the actual act of me
having to tell them and like break the
news which is the awkward thing I can
literally count on one hand the amount
of people that I've told what I'm about
to tell you um and people I've told
people that I know really really really
care about me and like did like not deny
even does it not deserve know it all but
knew like what would wanna know lie
would appreciate like knowing if that
makes sense
so I've told a lot of my own a lot of
talk like three or four clothes home
friends and Spencer you guys have to
hear no Spencer and that's it that's
everyone that I've told so now I'm gonna
broadcast it to potentially hundreds of
thousands of people on the internet but
I'm fine with doing that because you I
can't see your awkward way um literally
I did not just break it my camera
stopped filming automatically anyway I
can remember what I was saying because I
just literally took three seconds to
press rerecord and this is gonna get
really depressing um trigger warning but
and a lot of my close friends as well
not even thought yeah Michaels
it's fun actually I'm probably gonna
find out about this news from this video
which isn't great
just know that I'm happy I was happy
with you knowing it's just the initial
thing of me having to tell you which I
just felt really awkward about and like
with yeah it's it's a weird thing in my
head well I'm going to say in this video
because I feel bad not telling you guys
about this because you know my mom you
love my mom and that's a which I
absolutely love as well and you're very
very involved in like our relationship
you even involved in my mom and stuff
like you'll find her
yeah you just be very involved in it as
so basically like a year and a half ago
I think maybe two years I'm not too sure
um she was diagnosed with terminal lung
cancer um so yeah it's not great um
kinda it was all very hard cuz we were
always very like a simple like nothing
was ever wrong no one ever really had
any illnesses you know like it's one of
those things where you hear about you
know oh my mom's got cancer and my mom's
got this and all this like from even
like like um friends and you may be
reading online and you think oh god like
that's awful but you just never think
that had happened to you and then it
didn't it like hit me hard I was like oh
my god I literally I've no I reacted to
it with I was just like emotionless
for like two weeks and that III don't I
reacted tips things really weirdly um so
yeah that was kind of like a big thing
so to do with that I'd wanted you guys
to know about that because if any for
example like this is like an extreme but
if anything did for example happen for
the worst and you guys didn't know about
and obviously found out and you were
like oh my god what the hell like I'm so
confused I kind of want you guys just
just like know by way I guess and feel I
also hold it to you guys because you
know my mom I knew like loved my mom and
I felt like I was indirectly lying to
you by not telling you even I don't know
it's hard to explain and I think you
probably get it anyway but yeah so
moving out to do with that it's kind of
like scary I guess
because I can't like always like be that
like what like not like kind of watching
her at all that I mean it she's and the
thing is you probably watch my videos me
like she looks so fine and we were like
lucky such an ironic word to use in that
circumstance but lucky with it through
that like B she's obviously like on
chemo for it but she doesn't lose her
hair and so it's not like very visible
so that's I guess externally an easy
thing to deal with like because you look
and you think oh she's fine nothing's
wrong it's all kind of like hidden I
guess so yeah
that's not great but it's something that
I'm dealing with as I said it's terminal
it's no there's no cure for it it's just
gonna be there for however long and so
like it's you just you just gonna deal
with it you try to get on with it get on
with life and yeah so that happened and
yeah as I said that just like links with
moving out it's just being like oh it's
gonna be kind of just not being able to
see her all the time and get updates all
the time and stuff I mean I can text her
all that I don't it's kinda it's just
like a little mental thing I guess I
can't really put into words so that's
something that I just wanted you guys to
know about as I said just so you know
and that is that I'm kind of glad the
timer went off thanks I had no idea
where I was gonna continue off that like
tell you that and then be like anyway so
yeah I'm so excited tomorrow to be
moving out so yeah thank you timer it
got deep but I said some stuff in there
that I wanted to say I'm kinda going off
my chest to do with like my channel in
the direction that is going and that's
gonna change kind of do like series and
stuff because this channel is PG I mean
my whole channel stock PG whatsoever but
this channel is PG just so you should
just be monetize it and because if you
judy monetizes this channel that means i
can no longer do you two full-time and
and that would really really suck
because it's what i absolutely love
doing so i just got to keep this channel
PG ish in terms of just i can't swear on
it but I'm still me like I'm not putting
on a fake act for a year olds being like
oh hi guys it's Millie and it's just
more just
me without the swearing but if and if
you know me in real life you know that I
swear a lot so it's hard yeah that was
my stripped-down challenge I hope you
enjoyed and yeah the next video that you
see might be to do with a house or
whatever
again I'm talk to you and I think it's
gonna be a clothing video actually cuz I
just did some shopping on through but
yeah thank you guys so much for watching
and I'll see you in my next video bye
