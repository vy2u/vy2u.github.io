to today's video which is going to be a
haul now there's like a range of
different shops here I think it's like M
JD or like Topshop river island
misguided loads of different shops I'm
gonna go through a few things that I've
bought and hopefully you'll pick up some
ideas for me and you some more job that
you want two bags so I'll be enjoying
this video okay I need to say this
feeling quickly as well and it's not
sponsored or anything but first thing
that I want to help you with and I got
from Tesco and it is the special case
cereal box these are absolutely amazing
I've got the Belgium milk chocolate and
the red berry one as well it comes in a
pack of five for like a quid or
something like that and there's about 17
calories per bar and they are so so good
I really like this okay so the first
thing that I got is this top from River
Island now what I've found out is that I
don't have enough like casual tops I you
always have like really extravagant
random tops so I just got this gray
ribbed tip crop top that I can laugh
when I gone holiday because it's summer
in England so it's very nice weather
right now this nice as it gets in
England anyway oh and the reason I've
got so much from like mere islands and
stuff is because they had a huge to sail
on so I got in that faster than you can
even imagine
okay next is a more extravagant top I
guess you could say and it is this one
from River Island again so it's just
looks like this and it's really long for
the thing that I really liked about it
was the slip that it has down the back
it's got a really deep core that like
shows off a lot of your back and things
like that so I just think it's really
nice casual wear that's kind of good for
like any season you could get away with
wearing this in winter I guess and
summer and autumn and spring so what can
you complain about now the reason that I
really like River island is because they
have a box tops there which you like
square tops in a way the length like six
I on my hips so it's just such a perfect
fit for away from women jeans or
anything like that I absolutely love
them and this one is what I got and then
I really know what it says I really
really like it and it's really glittery
as well so you can wear it when you want
to get more dressed up as well I got
this t-shirt here and it's very high
like and kind of a high neck top like
this and it's from River Island again
it's a dot read : right now like my
obsession with colors is a gray dark
gray light gray and it kind of grows
really good for me but thing is I've
bought like great tops and gray pants as
well and I can't wear them together so
I'm struggling to find an outfit that I
can kind of mix up a bit without it
being completely grey I got some night
pro pants now you can get three-quarter
length when I decided to go for the full
length so these are these are them night
rolls are very very tight kind of the
leg or leggings in a way but a lot
tighter and they just allow flexibility
when doing maybe gymnastics or working
out at the gym and also I find them a
lot easier to work out in rather than
just normal shorts and I really really
love these monthly favorites this has to
be one of them oh yeah showed you one of
these t-shirts before so I'll show you
it again but it's a different color
obviously along with the grey one I got
a pink one looks like that again it's
ripped I don't know why I think kind of
river islands trademark is having their
clothing ripped because I just feel like
when I go in there was those ribbed
everyone so I got this misguided Scott
here and I okay I know what a wise guy
is so typical why now like everyone has
one but I really really like them
I only do funny story that's the second
Scott that I have got from misguided
because the first one had a little bit
of an incident with the zip where I
thought I had zipped it up at the back
because I felt the zip go up but it
hadn't the zipper top at all so
basically it goes really far down like
back in the bombing I walked out and
this was on a school trip
but it kinda saw not my best moment I
have to say great memory though so this
is the kind of best top thing I was
talking about before
it has mid length sleeves as well which
I really like a down the yarn because I
always get goose bumps on the top of my
arm so it stops them from getting goose
bumps and at the base quite hanging for
the front but at the back it is really
really low down which I absolutely love
and then also it's not really best of
the psyche of bodysuit goes up like this
and then that is the bottom area as you
can see there and then this and
unbuttoned like so so when you need to
pee it doesn't like it's not too much
for hard work I was working on the dress
category so I decided to go for this
very nice white dress here from House of
Fraser and it's sipped down the bag and
I think it goes to mid side so it's not
too short but I really really like it I
think it's really nice and and I bought
it I think it's about 30 pounds or so
which was not a bad price at all and
then I check back on the website a few
days later and guess why's that one sale
half-price Topshop I decided to buy
these pin chocolate eggs they are great
cause I could medium go and they look
like this and I really like this seam
that goes down the middle I don't really
know why I just think it adds a nice
effect to the jeans rather than them
just being plain and simple and I didn't
mean to say jeans
I meant say Lane also as its bikini
season I decided to get some nice a
white bikini bottoms because I just
thought that I don't will do well in the
category of a matching bikini bottoms
and bikini tops so I thought why just
goes with anything any design any color
so I got these so that I could wearing
with any bikini top and from Topshop
again I think I don't know who copied
you but this has a ribbed effect on it
as well on the t-shirt it is a great top
shop
it is a great crop top with long sleeves
as well so when it's like lukewarm or
mid weather outside I can just throw
this on and it will keep me very warm
but also quite cool at the same time my
belly will have a nice breeze on it okay
if you are really bad at keeping
earrings like I am go to class get an
earring order mine's a doughnut one I
bet you jealous uh they just I've got
this when I was about seven and I kept
it and I'm so glad I did because then I
went to Primark and bought loads of
earrings you can get a pack of I think
ten earrings or one pound fifty and
there are so many to choose from
so these are the earrings that I bought
from Primark I was very very happy with
these because they came to a grand total
of three pounds all together so these
are mine Ikes these are free ones
I think nope these my knight flexes
because they flex a lot I don't have
many trainers because I stick to dollar
shoes absolutely love dollar shoes so
much my look for them is unreal so I've
got these from Tesco's they look like
this they are very pointed they are just
flats
pointed at the toe black shiny effect
and I really like them I don't even know
what it is about them I just think the
really classy and stylish and on the
same subject of Dolly shoes these were
on the 8 pounds of the sale as well so
there's going to straight in my basket
these black dollar shoes you can't even
see them you'll blend into one color
