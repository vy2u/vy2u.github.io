top video the reason that I have done
this video now is because obviously this
game colder so we will be wearing sweat
more sweaters or jumpers so it really
fits in now if you watch my videos too
regularly you will know that I have so
hey long introduction so I will skip
straight to question number one what is
your favorite scent it my favorite
scented candle is definitely one of the
young candles and if I had to choose one
it would be the lavender vanilla now if
you are Yankee Candles you'll know that
you can get different ones you can get
the car candles which kind of hang em
above your rear-view mirror and and you
can also get the reading diffusers you
can get travel tins all sorts of
different ones
and they are also quite cheap unless you
get the actual candle and then there are
about thirty pounds it depends on the
size but I just really like this one it
smells so so fresh which is really good
for autumn but it's especially good for
spring because I will sing spring new
lives happening is all fresh so this
Villa fits in with spring but also it
fits him with autumn just as well so I
chose this candle specifically because
it's um it's not to story but it's not
true wintery it's kind of in the middle
which is what autumn is so that's
question number one
now it's question number two coffee tea
or hot chocolate if I'm honest I don't
really like white chocolate I don't even
know why I don't like it I suppose I'm
just not that interested in the taste it
just seems a bit tasteless and bland to
me I know how much sugar I have to wear
I've also tried the malteaser one when I
have to a little of malteses and it
still doesn't work kind of still doesn't
taste very good to me so I kind of given
up on that coffee it's not strong enough
I'm not too keen on it and but te I love
it l of tea so obviously that's question
number three is what's the best full
memory you have definitely going to the
cottage with Holly now Holly is my best
friend and we went to the cottage and
its really loud to use going on but it
was so good I'll show you a portrait
this is what the closet looks like it
was a massive area but obviously and we
when the whole bit so this is the whole
side all together you walk in through
the main entrance this is a massive
hallway that leads out to the back as
well and basically as you're going
through there on these theaters tables
here and on this table there were food
and you put donations in and they
trusted you to put the money in and then
you took a bag and fed the horses or
phonons or chickens or turkeys or
whatever they had and sheep and also on
this table there was like a donations
one unjust one was basically and these
darker bits here emit events with the
doors for the Cottagers and then this is
a cottage obviously there's four
different ones here and then if you go
down this way you're going to this huge
everyone's loads of animals if you go up
through this way there is a load of just
play aries and things like when Holly
went to the cottage we met them these
two girls and we were oh my god we prank
one of the girls by telling her that
we're we're a psychic and we could see
girls oh so we didn't think we were
psychic we were just saying that turd to
kind of a freak her out because we're
not nice people and no we are really and
I hope and but it was just absolutely it
was amazing the cottage we always want
to go again I don't go it we've always
wanted to go again but and next year and
my dad's and what recently bought a
caravan in Thorpe Park
so we are going to and go what holiday
there because we can go whenever we like
that really cuz you don't dare although
all he has to do is just drive there
which makeup Jen do you prefer dark lips
opened eyeliner now if I'm honest this
is quite a big thing time so beauty guru
but I'm not the best that winged
eyeliner and a tall winged eyeliner I
can't do it's just I can do normal
eyeliner we're just stops when it comes
to wing winging the eyeliner then you
end up going like that with wings like
that I like that I have tried a lot of
times but they don't always turn out to
be very successful
so I'm have to I'm gonna have to go with
dark lips on that one I'm tight dark
lips to let I preferred dark lips to
light lips anyway question number five
best fragrance would fall definitely
Jimmy Choo now for summertime I love
taking my Apple but for for fall or
autumn Jimmy Choo they for bringing up
closer this is what the packaging looks
like if you haven't already seen it and
I'll look at some ups and I've also got
another one and that's all used up I've
muted it all then with this one itself
question number six it's over
Thanksgiving food different money so
don't really have to adjust wrong
dinners and I should but yeah Christmas
I don't have Christmas dinners because I
just don't like them so I end up having
like stupid chips one should and still
Thanksgiving I probably just have
chocolates bunch of peppermint sauce
different honest so now it's question of
bear what is the autumn weather like
where you live girl I'm from England
there was neben ass I do not like
England question number eight is a most
worn of sweater
now the other stressor I have is
currently at school and and that's
probably one of my favorite sweaters but
it's bright black at the sleeves I on
the back and then on the front it's
black and white like checks all down
there and it looks really nice I think
so I really like that one and but I also
like this one right here for eating
around in the house in because it's just
really good
comfy cozy keeps you warm so that was
question number eight so now I'm
twisting um and I must have nail polish
this fall this right here I put plain
white background on and like just paper
behind it so you can see it I'm gonna
like these two because they are just so
good it's Maybelline New York super
separates tips day 7-days gel nail color
it's a really really cool it actually
does stay on for seven days or more
depending on how often you shower and so
I find these really really really good
for us and because ultimate Minds me
pink don't ask why I don't know it just
really does so that was question number
nine so now question number ten playing
football or jumping in piles of leaves I
actually don't mind football if that one
is but I love company in piles of leaves
but every time I have a fallen over so
it's a bit sad but I like falling over
in palliative please consider to the her
so I'm going to take piles of leaves
jumping in piles of leaves question in
real life it bass ski jeans or leggings
the person that invented skinny jeans
obviously invented school because they
are both pointless skinny jeans don't
make a blind bit of difference to you
because they just basic lay and show off
you flap because see if you honor you
like to have my flub like that then go
just go aim at the bits of love where it
goes in and basically understand what
looking fatter than you look before but
leggings are kind of buggy well not
always when tell you which ones in use
mine normally quite tight but they are
very stretchy so it doesn't obviously
show up as bad so I probably say the
leggings for that
well definitely say leggings for that
because skinny jeans do not go Christy
number twelve
combat boot socks definitely looks
I will books and especially the ankle
ones the full-length or so or I iced
liked them but the ankle looks I amazing
I love them and know they are to say
really nicely uncle thirteen is pumpkin
spice were worth the hype
um I'm going to show us poking spice at
least I know that it's a sin like you
can get candles with the sin and if it
is then I do not realize yesterday it
smells like my grandma's and my
grandma's carpet oh oh no I didn't don't
do that is if it's everything to the
spice is it worth the hype no because it
stinks okay question number 14 favorite
fall TV show the Christmas channel in
for the Christmas channel comes out so
in my world the Christmas channel is
included in that
so the Christmas channel comes out on
the sky in England and I love it it just
like elf owl flies so funny I love
comedy films and I love power oh how is
so good oh so good horror film in like
do yourself with fry and then just be
can't sleep you just got a so good in
there yeah no I really do like horror
films are 15 what song really gets to
you into the fall spirit okay so this is
kind of an obvious answer but sweater
weather that's your favorite song it's
by DM the neighborhood it's just really
good it's a really good song and I like
it and it's probably it definitely
definitely suits this video and it
definitely suit Altima as well I also
like all the songs such as like Miley
Cyrus and Jason Derulo actually the real
like Jason Vela right now
seems like that in general but if we
keep him more to theme then definitely
and sweater weather by the neighborhood
