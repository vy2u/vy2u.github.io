video I pulled a prank on call me it was
very awkward I regretted it as soon as I
started the prank I was like oh no what
have I done however I do want to do a
disclaimer so you don't think that I'm a
complete me and how we are really close
friends we've had a lot of conversations
touching on this topic ever so slightly
and I knew who's gonna be completely
safe to do this prank and he wouldn't
outright be like oh yeah I like you back
I knew he wouldn't say that I could
literally predict what his response
would be and what he would say after I
told him that I liked him if I even
slightly thought oh no he could actually
say he liked me back I would not have
done that prank that would have been so
horrible so mean I wouldn't have done
that I knew that it was completely safe
I also talked to Jordan beforehand just
to double-check even though I was
certain already say yeah also call me
was not suspicious whatsoever that it
was a prank which really took me by
surprise and even made it more awkward
because I felt like he was way too real
in a way and I was like oh my god this
is so awkward like what is he actually
thinking right now as I oh god this is
the first prank I've ever done on this
channel and if you want to see more
pranks leave a like on this video and
I'm just saying that because I look at
the view to like ratio and decide
whether you guys like the video and want
to see more safe you all comment saying
I guess unless you want to comment same
you want to see more as well and he's
fine I really don't care watch the video
watch the prang enjoy let's just go with
it cold call me it's showing something
hopefully calm he'll get comfortable
disdain
don't leave and then I'll come in your
car yo Bob come in mine why I know
everybody said about fire ok yes
what my food paper go ha why am i stupid
of them that's not true sir come on look
at this
no us here is a picture of team cake
well I don't know much but is clipping
because it's kind of like God you see
you're going to reductive
just what you know why did you ever love
to tell me we filmed about you that I go
outside
edge words of one deep feelings I've
been open all today I noticed after that
happened like that kind of in the air
no kx5 fine yes fine no cuz I'm just
thinking like did you ever have you look
like single tweaks and so today is that
bad I think what I got in swamp dm's
though I don't have to speak to me again
and accompany your Chiodos like we never
said anything
yeah like yeah I just don't tweet so I
guess just like you've got people who
like wasn't that yeah it's been
recently so many people is shipping also
I did because there wasn't one I was
asking about it and I said like even if
he offered me a body he said but all my
instagrams of tweets and stuff he said
he always sees people because he's
like what do you think think about to
make you feel that perfectly yeah I feel
like it just like more recently and like
we don't think we she knows not like I'm
thinking about it and more and not the
whole like Barbie thing like us together
it sounds great but yeah I wasn't if you
thought I'd like actually like yeah
they just recently I was melty so what I
kind of think I do like like you being
serious
oh yeah I don't need to be actually just
so like funny you say so what you saying
I I'm just gonna I just like wanted to
get out my chest I guess this is the
stop joking I did this oh no no I'm not
thinking of this that was I mean I
didn't I was really impressed by I was
like funny yeah well it just like it's
got me thinking I guess I don't know
just like how I feel about like you say
to me and I just I don't know I really
people I can see it going anywhere
oh yeah I guess just out of interest I
don't know how to be about the same
thing but everything fun stuff I'm
really good at relationships I've never
had like an actual relationship well if
he had lost Felicia it was you know yeah
and I only see people even though yeah
obviously because I interests like we
always talked about they also guide to
each other as well just like just
casually I guess actually thinking more
like this I feel like that babe actually
have you spoken to anyone in the group
about this I feel like I'm comfortable
if anything happened we meet you because
we coming out so much and everyone else
yeah yeah sure can you change things no
no no it's weird
what's up why did you like just so they
I don't want to be in this video anymore
what do I say obviously can you see it
yes yeah I'm sweating so much you made
when you write I want to talk to you
it's like Oh God
I did actually don't know I'm gonna say
some things recently we've been on grief
clothes I didn't know if it was like
getting to the point where it's like I
gotta be some ugly dating but yeah yeah
I sat down I was like oh like this wrong
I knew that it would be safe we've had
like the tops of the pasta like how to
touch my exes like maybe like you
wouldn't like do that excited to know
like how you i wella yeah not cool I
still have been a deep charting for the
camera I feel really worried about it
remember that we had that deep yes very
true because climate for now I'm
sweating a little
yeah I care what you mean with the
futures but why did she do it all the
future holds yeah good see I we could be
teared a little bit but for right now
eyes weren't fun I did
the responsibility of the public of
relationship yeah I think right now like
I wanna I would like the best of myself
and I think when I actually have like a
girlfriend all the best with Emily I
think right now isn't the time for me
that I said to myself to my being I feel
like if I was to gonna go forever alone
I would make it I would make them feel
like the best and stuff like right now
in the future yeah the futures weird
experience we got experts I thought my
voice is going to reap its meal I feel
we just killed mommy who knows I'm not
making prime because I'm so not as she's
better she I didn't understand what it
looks like some skin I'm not look dated
yeah John thank you for helping me set
up Carmen you're welcome yeah I had to
as well provided the prank I had to ask
Jordan if comi said and into him at any
point I mean any but no he did say
Oh mommy so just in case that he I said
anything to like bad I wouldn't have
done it because this means it's mean
mommy well that's not going in what's
your take on my I think it's their lime
low-key I have to find on the future of
Aki washed every single book to find out
like scripted self promo like I want to
say this one you say that
Aki new is a prank the actual action but
really if you say that when you see if
you looked at the camera any point
truly may be played may be acted dumb
maybe a plea gee maybe say maybe you
really like me but then you saw the
camera and then pretended that you
didn't do more like me when you actually
did cuz then you saw the camera oh sure
I'm gonna take your guess and save you
you got secondhand awkwardness from that
prank if he hears even I do watching it
back yeah um as I said at the style
video if you do want to see more pranks
let me know in the comments below and
just tell me what kind of pranks you do
want to see I felt so awkward filming
this prank but I really like the feeling
of awkwardness in a weird way I don't
even know if that makes any sense
but if something's all
I literally like absorb the awkwardness
I'm like I love this and then I no
longer feel I don't know how to explain
it but yeah basically I'm happy to do
more pranks even if they are awkward the
only kind of pranks that I couldn't do
as I tell my mom that I'm pregnant or
something because the look of disgust on
her face the second that I tell her will
be way too much to handle she just my
god yeah yeah yeah so see you in my next
video this hopefully much less cringe
