another herb a video by extreme extreme
requests but this time you guys wanted
to see some make up and I'm going to
doing a part two to the dress test
things but I thought I'd break it up a
little bit and throw in a make it one in
the middle the website eBay is mainly
known for selling products quite cheap
which is great however sometimes they
are - for a reason and that's because
they are the original brand these are
fake but made to look like they are real
so the ingredients they just copy and
paste the ones from the original
products well that's not what they made
to make the knockoff you don't know what
chemicals have gone into the knockoff
brand you don't know what to put in so
it's really really really not a good
idea to buy them it's better to be safe
than sorry and now I'm being quite a
critical time using these products just
for a video when it's video ends I'm not
going to be using them they will be
thrown away so on the video I asked you
guys on Twitter what kind of makeup
products you'd like me to buy a fake one
from ebay and what have you said Kylie
lip kit so unit this is the original
bead Ock is it don't okay so scary Ock
I'm not sure quite sure how to pronounce
that doesn't matter anyway but this is
the original one I don't have the
original packaging it's a big scary few
years ago I used I bought steaks on eBay
by accident and I received them and I
was like oh my god that sulfate easy to
tell but now I'm looking at it and I'm
like I don't know how to tell is its
fake or not even though I know that it
is because that price it is impossible
and I'd have to have the original
packaging which unfortunately I don't
have so we're just going to move on to
the actual lip products the knock-offs
is a lot thinner or it when I hold you I
can feel it's thinner and also is a lot
more Brown like the original da CK has
kind of peachy undertones who ever seen
knockoffs just this like a pure brown
color so now you are trying the moment
seeing our me look hi sorry for the
coldness looking at the lip liner so
what we're is a pretty accurate I can't
compare them on size because I've used
the original one like of sharpened it
with lost length take a few swipes to
get like a pigmented swatch where it on
the original one
teachers like much more pigmented like
one swatch you can probably get the same
amount of pigmentation yeah it's no I'm
nervous pigmented fake one
that's like filtery to what the wand is
almost identical it's quite a bit darker
Michael look look it's you probably like
fades in what is I kind of I almost
prefer the shade on these fake side but
it's just not trying to say like this is
already ratified whereas this is still
where and I don't think it will mattify
be uniting that was highly highly
request for me to try out with the
Anastasia's welcome because I didn't
have this division where that has to go
and buy the original clock it as well so
you've got packaging comparison when I
first received the knockoff I look to
the languages I doubt so real-looking
I hope of the ordered a real one and but
then I compared it to the original and
they are completely different the fake
one it doesn't even try and be
convincing just because it's got the
Anastasia
logos plum tribe in the middle of the
packaging when this one doesn't have
anything of the so like it is kind of
clearance week the original one also has
quite a lot of shimmer on the packaging
and whether it's the knockoff one dozen
neon where on the original has been much
darker brown than the knockoff where is
enough after more of like a peachy color
so I thought we cover off and I'm just
going to open them up I'm sorry this
video is going to be really long I've
just notice and I've bought a lot why is
it a difference but not too much the
text is completely different and in the
original one e-text is a bold red color
whereas any knockoff is a sin quality
color and also the text isn't centered
want me to highlight which it should be
but also tahleen is the different color
on the knockoffs is a darker purple
we'll check them out anyways see all the
girls by the way if you're watching this
video and you are enjoying and you want
to see me test out somewhat more ebay
dresses and I both like two dollars make
sure you subscribe to my channel and hit
application bail so you will be notified
every time I upload a new video which is
every Monday hopefully it will leave you
to decide which side is fake which side
you think is like and which one do you
think is the real one
fake real to be fairly big one isn't as
bad as I thought it would be to the
highlight like it genuinely does show
quite a bit of shimmer however when I
then put on the real one I was like yeah
there's a lot of difference that is a
lot more reflective next one also highly
requested jeffree star I have the
packaging for these because I also had
to buy a Jeffery scale liquid lipstick
the sticker here is telling you what
shade it is only regional it kind of
overlaps onto the other side of the
packaging where the barcode is however
only knockoff is a separate square
sticker which is a massive warning signs
to it being fake by the way when I
ordered these I knew that they were
going to be fake but I just wanted to
film a YouTube video and show you guys
the comparison between your real and
fake one and also to tell you don't buy
cheap makeup from eBay because it's
probably not real 9910 to the time it's
not it always slight difference is that
only in knockoff one we get it you've
got a motorbike shut up Thanks after the
phone they are both scary similar the
only difference that I can see it's so
slight is that owning the Cosby text
it's slightly faded and also not
centered okay when I look at the actual
product now I haven't actually opened
the product for the fake one that is so
real looking
oh my god didn't stick on the buttons a
bit different to the original yeah the
sticker is a massive give ways to how
it's fake I think wanted to say two
remaining it looks to be printed quite
badly
whereas only original it says to mind it
but then around 8h jeffree star
cosmetics made in the USA the shades are
completely different the original one is
a lot lighter but absolute the stars of
a television are identical fake products
have really improved over the years
so this applies involved I want to find
out that the camera was recording so
that's fantastic
ah so the fake one is so hard to apply
and I don't know why but yeah these are
the bowls this is the real one and that
is the fake one I can say for definite
that I prefer the real one just because
he goes on a lot more smoothly whereas
the fake one just it didn't like evenly
distribute which is really nice
also if a foundation patchy I apologize
it is also I've changed as well the
applicator for them bolts are like
completely different I look at that it's
got kind of a slanted head on the wand
when is this one I don't even know what
shape that is but it's just one also
full another the highly requested one
being naked 3 palette 2 light is Wei Qi
and you hear that light it just doesn't
really squishy as well yeah and I said I
expect these all to face but I'm just
confirming like by some chance it was
real it's definitely not just feeling
really cheap also it Evan TK always have
a film over the mirror this one with no
skills
it also looks Li bit of a weird color on
its packaging on the inside looks feel
of it two oranges I don't know well
compared to miracle anyway I looked it
up what is the packaging is extremely
similar as well however I mean 83
original is a lot more bronze this is a
very formal video I don't know heart
feel others Oh on the false one that's
not like kids makeup those very
chemically I just shade matches so like
these shades are so similar other than
the fact that shade such as black heart
and both are a lot ah
but on the original they are more
shimmery some of them okay I'm going to
do three swatches and you've got to try
and guess which one is fake which one's
real
first one second one
which only thinks real and which one you
think is fake you get that the real one
I think it is pretty obvious you know
the pigmentation is extremely extremely
deep in this one whereas on that one I
mean that's a swatch but you can't even
tell next thing that was your question
Mac I did a video on my channel three
years ago now about real versus face
matte lipsticks because I bought a fake
laugh eBay and I was fuming I'm so angry
but you know you're living your word and
you end up buying six more fake products
so yes I bought it in Ruby weed because
I do have the rooby-roo color but I have
these packaging for another shape so
it's called rebel but max packaging is
the exact same Buhl's and obviously what
shade it is they're not pass the first
warning sign was the new boo boo kaleil
to stick and map your boots because they
are high-end and high-end makeup
products more or less always print on
the shade of lipstick on 2d packaging so
as you can see this color rebel it's
just printed onto the packaging websley
knockoff is a sticker it is very very
dense achill now there's one thing that
will always tell you whether your MAC
lipstick is fake or real and that is by
swapping the lid if you swap the lids of
two original mac makeup products they
will just fit on each other perfectly
however when they are fake they will not
yes it doesn't fit can you see that I
can't get it down any more than that
yeah oh well all that matters you always
mate on the actual makeup product the
movie whew there is not even stuck on
remotely accurately on the bottle I know
they're always perfectly centered but
you should take in the myth it's like
all the luffing on the edge also the
fake one is quite a bit wider and also
just like just feels like crappy
materials review is a matte lipstick
color and this is way too shiny I just
quickly lip line
as you can see is an ultra matte
lipstick so this one looks a little bit
too shiny for my likings we will see
those white beads on it we can see oh my
gosh that goes very easily oh oh no no
no I tell you what's not mark this
lipstick the fake one just definitely
wouldn't last like I'm doing that and
it's just sliding everywhere real one
fake one finally the anastasia dipbrow
pomade and i'm interested to see what
the it's fake looks like I haven't even
took it out of its packaging yeah it's
fake instantly I just opened it and it's
like a bit of a smudge of the actual dip
brow pomade just on these white
cardboard lid it's a bit of a good way
okay the fake one the Anastasia logo is
slightly thicker and it's also got a few
scratches on it oh yeah on the fake one
you can easily skip it by r20 my nails -
it's like scratching everywhere that is
terrible
that is not even trying to look
convincing at all and then on the bottom
again on the fake 1z snicker it isn't
centered which it usually should be and
the text is slightly thinner on a knock
off one whereas on the original is just
overall a lot more high-end looking and
one just a little little sloppy as well
my visual test centering Wow okay so for
the actual size of the product is got it
absolutely exact this is the fake lid on
the original dip brow pomade fits
perfectly and doesn't ruffle when it's
on or anything but it's crazy okay now
to browse I'm going to use the of course
legit anastasiya eyebrow brush and along
with that so here we go
I don't hate it when I don't love it
it's just slightly off-color like I'm
not a big fan of that call it just
something worried about it
it might even worse than the fake side
just because I don't like my eyebrow
shape there as it is oh my god
why am I like this I'd have to sort this
side ours just copy what they're doing
right now but as you can see just sort
the product is a lot more evenly
distributed than this side row it's a
little bit patchy that is everything for
