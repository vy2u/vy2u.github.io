today's video which is a kind of hacks
video in the past I've done I think
about 12 hats videos start on a lot but
I've never actually tested hacks
nevermind weird hacks so I'm really
excited for this before I do sell this
video I want to give a shout out to clue
who have very kindly sponsored this
video spot a video however all of my
opinions are completely honest I'm not
going to work with a brand that I really
don't believe it I've used app clue in
the past it's been around for a few
years and out the app basically just
tracks your period for you and tries to
get as close with an estimate as
possible as to when your next period
will be I'm not very good with figuring
things out but clue is really really
easy because it just walks you through
everything you need and that's very
useful of course it's free and it's
available on iOS and Android store both
of them if you give this much
information to the app that's possible
not like your house address or anything
that will be weird but like your
emotions for that day whether you
feeling happy or sad your pain levels
whether you've got cramps whether you
experiencing PMS it just uses all the
information to predict as accurately as
possible when your next period will be
it might not be a hundred percent
accurate at first but once you start
using it for a few months it's as
accurate as you're going to get to
predicting it a new feature that the app
is introduced is that you can share your
cycle with your partner if you want to
so that he expects to know when as guys
love to say you're PMSing so
that's all three click Next by the way
on to the video now stop the first thing
that I'm going to be doing is making a
self-tan which I just realized our loan
long sleeve so you know good planning
for that really so all you need for this
is some cocoa powder or I use hot
chocolate because I don't have any cocoa
powder
I don't bake and some moisturizing cream
Instagram didn't really give me many
instructions it just said to mix them so
I'm going to start with my cream and
then I'm going to spoon some hoggle you
see that so you just basically got to
mix the moisturizing cream and cocoa
powder or hot chocolate powder together
and it should make a brown moisturizing
cream that will tell you okay you know
what that's actually not about to shade
it just looks really edible like I'm
kind of tempted to eat it you know
you've got acrylic nails on and then
really long how hard is it to put
moisturizing cream on so just get all
undo nails
anyway oh my god oh that actually works
genuinely that works oh my god I need to
melt so good as well as if that works
I didn't I expect work so I'll so much
like chocolate as well oh so this next
hack states that if you wrap your hair
around a pencil
straighten it your hair will be very
curly like tight curls I've always
wanted my hair to be a nice tight curl
so we're just gonna have to see if this
works
I'm going to actually burn myself
I don't know how to do this Oh
Oh No Wow oh my god is it oh I should
have smelled my hair into it ash oh it's
stuck oh my god seriously guys if you
want tight curls don't waste like 50
pounds on a curler by a pencil I really
want to try it with tight curls so here
it is it's really kind of treatment that
I can get will make it permanent like
this because I would be interested in
that
why can't my hair to be like this all
the time because I've got actually got
volume for one so my hair's not flat now
I've kind of enforced my dog into my
room with the promise of treats I'm
going to just curl your chest hair I'm
gonna curl your testicles charlie no
choice they say sex anything I'm not
burning you baby I'm a good boy yeah oh
it's candy yeah head up Johnny you're
cool
you already had curly hair so it's a
little bit unfair okay so this next
one's kind of ironic
it says if you run out of translucent
powder or white powder you should bake
your face with flour I think that's kind
of ironic because you should actually
bake with flour just not your face so
we're going to see how that goes so I've
got some good old home pride self
raising flour
this brush is so bad baking with
I've got everywhere gone oh my
god
look give snowman 15 minutes later it's
time to bake a now
you know what it actually worked looks a
little bit weird and a little bit off
kind of makes me look a little bit ill
however for the sake of baking it kind
of does work
this looks good and this next one I'm
really excited about it's using crayons
as lipstick so you've just got to melt
them I've using a hairdryer or using a
microwave and these didn't melt at all
so we're going to put them on over a
flame I feel like I'm going to actually
call myself some kind of injury so okay
what the heck it's literally just turned
it gray didn't even melt it you just put
an ash coating over it but you know what
that has debunked it doesn't work quite
mesmerizing to look at actually okay the
next one is using a sock for foundation
so apparently this axe is like some kind
of beauty blender so we're just going to
see it you just gonna kind of make you
like a wall and I'm gonna try and apply
some foundation with it it's so hard to
blend this while light oh I don't know
it like works then again I feel like
anything kind of works that's a material
to apply foundation I feel like by
swiping it oh you're just removing the
foundation because it's like picking it
off it's not like a sponge is just a
fabric like a wipe that you wipe it off
with but yeah that is everything for
today's video I really hope that you
enjoyed it if you did give it a thumbs
up and leave a comment below let me know
your thoughts which is your favorite
hack yeah that is everything have a
beautiful day and don't get stay
positive
