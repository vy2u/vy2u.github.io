already sweating but let's just say that
it's highlighter so I've always been
someone that is absolutely terrible at
applying eyeliner because I just can't
do it I can never get them even everyone
knows how that goes um so I was looking
online and I found these stencils
eyeliner stencil so you put around your
eye and they just provide a template for
you to basically color in and create the
perfect wing so this is the stencil that
I received here I went online and bought
it on eBay and as you can see you kind
of in to put this stencil around your
eye and then a small section of it will
be left and you can follow the curvature
of the stencil here to do the perfect
cat eye eyeliner so the stencil was
relatively easy to adjust just as a tip
you know the wing bit cat eye bit of the
stencil make sure that is on a more
steeper gradient than I did it because
when I took it off it was a lot more
flat than I wanted it to be also
anything that I don't really get with
these stencils is that they are proudly
universal but everyone's eyes are
different so the stencils won't fit
everyone's eyes and the eyeliner won't
fit everyone's eyes as well like for my
eyes my eyes are pretty big so the
stencil the wing didn't go out as much
as I'd want it to so it's kind of chance
on how they made this product whether it
will work with your eye shape or not so
a lot of the things that I have ordered
a holder dies so the eyeliner line was a
lot thicker than it should be so it's
another thing to point out so as you can
see when I took it off it wasn't an
amazing result at all so I'm going to go
ahead and try and clean up a little bit
at the start
fill it in even though that kind of
defeats the object of this whole thing
but as for the line itself since we
pretty defined so I'm just gonna fill on
this front bit and then see how I feel
but as I thought this is very thick here
so we're going to give it one more
attempt and see how it goes
okay so I'm just basically cool it in
the extensive it looks be pretty good
define line there
there's just a few little spots so which
I can sort out after I take it off
let's give it a goal and hope for the
best all right so I'm looking at it now
and I'm not liking it because this wing
has come to a quite full and end rather
than it being a sharp defined point
which I kinda won in an eyeliner is
everyone does and it I think such a
thick line I have old hooded eyes as it
is so it kind of drags them down a
little bit more which I'm not happy with
if you look at them side by side like
that is a mess like that is an absolute
mess okay so I'm leaving over -
voiceover format now and the wing on
this eye I am loving with my eyes closed
it's pretty sharp pretty straight which
I'm very happy with but with my eyes
open it's a different story as you can
see there is a gap between my eyelashes
and where the eyeliner begins which is
not the stencils fault and it is mine as
the Murrah was a long way away because
my camera was in the way of me putting
it on a flat surface so yeah I mean with
my eyes open that the wing is just too
short and really round my eyes and
changes my face completely but for the
worst so I don't really recommend this
product but I am gonna have a little bit
more of a play around with it and see if
it improves that is everything for
today's video guys I really do hope that
you enjoyed it and got your answer as to
whether you should or shouldn't buy this
product have a beautiful day and don't
forget to stay positive
mwah bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
