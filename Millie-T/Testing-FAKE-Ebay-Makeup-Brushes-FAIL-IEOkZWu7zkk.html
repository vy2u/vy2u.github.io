I'm going to be testing out fake
brochures but this video is going to be
another eBay video and that means I've
done two in a row and I really don't
want to do that I do absolutely love my
eBay videos but I just don't want to
over populate my channel with them on
lies kind of space them out a little bit
but the video that I plan to film fell
through so you've got two eBay videos in
a row I really hope you don't mind
before we jump into this video I have an
app recommendation that might interest
some of you this is sponsored by
Gameloft but I am so so transparent with
you guys and would never ever promote an
app that I really didn't think at least
some of you would enjoy I've been on
YouTube for about four or five years now
and I've done like four total
sponsorships I just found you your trust
so so much and I don't think that I'm
like a sellout or anything so please
know that I am being completely honest
and truthful and transparent the app is
called Disney Magic Kingdom's and it's
available on the App Store Google Play
Store and Windows Store basically
whatever device you're using you can
download the app and also it is
completely free as well they are
completely free so the app allows you to
kinda share moments with recognized
Disney characters which is Buzz
Lightyear Rapunzel and Mickey Mouse it
also features like real-life attractions
such as it's a small world Monsters Inc
and Space Mountain so in the game we're
working to read the park of a curse has
been put on it and restore it as a park
that visitors will genuinely enjoy so if
you've ever liked to own your own theme
park or have that experience then
download that I mean it's free so you
literally have like nothing to lose oh
I'm the link is in the description as
well as you want to kind of a fast track
wave get in there this is going to sound
like I've made this up I'm going to say
it anyway my little cousin has been
using this app for a while now so you
have your honor iPad that she's just got
and she absolutely loves the game and
I've actually the reason why I decided
to work with them in the first place so
I'm being truthful there's also been a
brand new Zootopia update where chief
bogo has gone missing and the most
complete quest again for this time to
kind of solve the disappearance so now
on to the video as with every single
Ebates video they come in like these
plain packages so I can just never know
what's inside anything but I know the
remake of bushes of
just no idea what kind okay so these the
first ones easily brushes actually
possums Weaver bushes the other month
and I probably display them in this IKEA
part that you've of course like never
seen before but without even comparing
them first of all I can just tell
they're a lot of it sticker than the
originals and also the rose gold
coloring of webs in mecca's the brushes
is a little bit of there's been a bit of
a lighting change I just have to sort
out anyway this over you brushes I've
got them here now it's actually
comparing them under my new sublime beam
brush oh no when you are brow brush
because I can tell as you spake
instantly hello thank you and the like
bristles could you say a light way too
high up there lots of difference between
them and they haven't done a very good
job of trying to make them seem legit
because as well as well be like rolls
gold neck comes down way further on the
fakes and also it's pink rather than
like a gold color of course my
expectations weren't high because we
were so cheap so I can't expect much for
I am just going to keep comparing them
just so you know the difference and
there's another big difference so the
only cute one says color love and makeup
on the handle and the fake one says rose
golden I've also just had to fix my
lipstick I listed it swept a lipstick
off because is so hot I replaced it now
so what I'm going to try and do with
this is if anyone watches like an of my
videos you'll know that I have a problem
where I just can't keep hold of things I
just drop things all the time
ah okay well that's faster to grass I
mean you couldn't really like get a
solid like line for your eyebrows when
you're doing like an outline or in terms
of filling in it does give quite a
natural effects I'm actually a lot more
impressed but I thought I would be next
one okay I'm a big computer I don't know
whether these I'll be supposed to the
Unicom bushes or whether they're
supposed to be like a real technique I
think we should try and control the most
annoying thing is using natural light on
a cloudy day
but this is a day that I only did that
from film because hashtags
the thing is not very dense for I think
with contour less dense bushes are
better because we get a lot more of a
lighting natural effects you know it's a
hot day when you've not even got
highlight on but it looks like it's the
cheeks of sweating again not diffusing
bad at all
I actually do like this make it three
bushes a quick little story time to go
along with this I use a Christmas
present call like a few years back and
my dad bought me maybe three bushes and
I was so happy with the mouth I got one
of these for ages were amazing I love
them only for every comment to be like
yeah the fake and fake Urban Decay don't
even do naked through bushes and what
now I replaced them well then the other
said they'd make it free question okay
right I'm going to do powder with this
one it just they don't even look I don't
even know why I thought they were real
when I got them like a few years back so
what do I do researches them it don't
like the order into which I'm doing like
are makes as well because I'm just like
done contour and nonpoint powder I'll
grip really glory yeah it's just not
even making a difference whatsoever
all these Real Techniques bushes yes
it actually looks projects it's got like
the back arm as well I don't have the
box to compare it to like the real box
another Holy Grail product of mine is a
real techniques buffing brush this is
the real one and this is a fake one yeah
it's great there's also like another
thing why this one kind of fans out ever
so slightly at the bottom here where we
just want to click straight down the
hallway anyway we're going to try it and
I want to do another color foundation
I've only used slight doubt never do
that it can
oh no no I don't like that it's a
lobbyist treaty not too much
after the brush it's not bad like it
just blend it but it could blend it more
I want to try an eye shadow brush an
outstanding tamasha no yes no no that's
not great oh I hate that so much it I
don't know how I don't know how he does
it but it just makes it look so patchy
like it so hard splendid this brush in
mind be the brush shape I'm not too sure
but I'm just not a fan of it my asshole
this is a Beauty Blender and I'm hoping
that it's good except just lost my
actual Beauty Blender why oh my god that
looks so legit oh my god what that was
like the actual Beauty Blender packaging
like big-time I'm actually like you feel
so satisfying like the actual one it
it's so like it okay I want to wet it
and then just give it a go this might as
well be the 100 delays challenge with
the amount of foundation and I'm using
what the hell I'm actually so sure that
this is a genuine Beauty Blender there
is nothing that I can tell it apart from
like is so smooth the colors exact the
shapes exact if you can pick up on
anything that's like in a telltale sign
that it's not the actual Beauty Blender
and please comment it below but it just
looks so like it and it feels like you
just the exact same job I hear the
manufacturers are just an amazing job of
making it seem realistic or I'm just
stupid enough to not be able to point
out that it is fake okay this is a final
tacit package I'm praying that these are
the unicorn brushes are they the unicorn
brushes I would determine that like I've
been ripped off and they had actually
arrived without have you taking them out
the package I can just tell the fake
you're already good to the color I'm
going to do the highlight one that I'm
actually trying to highlight on the
highlight that I'm wearing today is
called sweat so the real one has really
got to put in highlight on but all the
time in the past when I'm use like fake
makeup and stuff the highlights always
being better on the fake one so I'm
wondering whether the
they'll be better replied with a fake
brush or not and then the real one's
kind of like a grayish color black
publicly told Matthew it's almost gone
gross right I started sake on first I
can't see any product on the brush like
at all this was bad so look is my sweat
goes with it so well hey so pigmented
why are all the big ones always so much
more pigmented than the legit ones right
let's try the real one any wasting my my
expectations right to be a little bit
low so I feel like it's amazing what it
might be like even better with the
original so let's see right a lock on
which side I put it on yeah yeah actual
brush is so much better black oh my god
yet that is so pigmented in comparison I
don't it'll show up on camera again that
is the annoying thing I wish you all
hearing like person in front of me so I
could be like oh peep the highlights
that village it won't and that's the big
one the big one there is still some
payoff obviously but it's nowhere near
as much as the privilege a1 but it just
depends whether you want something
that's quite obvious ultimately more
subtle if so get yourself some fake ones
and save some dosh translations is the
English form of money one it might even
be American that I don't know there
needs to be like a new place like put
highlights or like the tip of the nose
the cheeks line is very where else you
could put it into the high ground I need
to watch my eyes that does not look
let's not emphasize to have okay I've
tested out everything there but before
you go don't even click out yet I see
you going to click out the video and
please do take a look at my blog channel
site I'm going to start taking that
channel so much more seriously like not
serious why it's still gonna be like
Katherine fun bitch do you want to get
to know me and for the actual
freak that I am feel free to take a look
at that channel and get rid of the
upcoming vlogs again the benefit launch
party is going to be cooler on Ellie's

other youtubers next month they'll get
ready for that oh I got this so much so
