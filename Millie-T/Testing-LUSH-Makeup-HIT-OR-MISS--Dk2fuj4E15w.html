stop speaking to that I'm actually
wearing clothes hi everyone a smelly
yesterday Alton leaves and I saw whoosh
I went in this is a rather big wash and
then I saw they had like a makeup
section it was really weird looking but
I thought I would buy some stuff to test
out so I have it here in a bag basically
a full face of makeup far eyebrow panels
and concealer as they didn't have that
something I do need to say about woosh
makeup is that it is all organic and
natural and handmade so I know not to
expect like a cake base kind of
Instagram look in the end it's going to
be more light and natural so that's just
a forewarning just in case you're
expecting extremely full coverage what
everything is so interesting what it
looks like - I hate that word but oh
right a job and stuff but it comes in
these are all like autumn ink tube
things it's really cool so I'm going to
give them a goal check them out and tell
you what I think I'm going to start off
with bushes cause supplement which is
basically they're edgy way of saying
foundation and I was matched to the
shade lighting which is what this is and
it seems to be a pretty good match
however this was their lightest shade
they had now I'm not like extremely fair
skin I mean I'm noticeably Caucasian
however I'm not like really really
really pale so there's people that are a
lot paler than me and this is their
paler shade I also looked at their dark
shades and this is the darker shade they
do to what I'm going to use for contour
which is dark but it's not extremely
dark basically they could go a lot
darker than that so their color range
isn't amazing however I'm thinking them
in the early stages of like developing
the foundations and stuff and they're
going to start bringing out more of a
range as like time goes on I think I
have taken way too much off there but
we're going to roll with it and hope for
the best that is a good match
I think I've took way too much out of
this
as I said all these products are organic
and natural so it won't be like really
full-coverage however it might be
buildable fabric if it ever so slightly
darker than my original skintone and
that's weird because it doesn't look it
but it's turned out to be that way and I
don't mind
Shadia done hmm I literally do these
videos as a normal person with normal
makeup skills so that you will most
likely have the same results if you buy
the same in here okay money is remaining
on under my eyes try and build it up
there so i use it as concealer because
Bush don't do concealer at least you
didn't in the store that I went in
alright the makeups are on and what it
is doing is it is creating a really even
skin tone but it hasn't covered anything
really like I can still see the
blemishes and they are slightly red here
like from where they already work I
don't if you can see on this camera or
not it's such light coverage but I can't
even tell you whether it's a matter do
is finish I don't know this next one is
emotional brilliant translucent face
powder this is the only face powder that
they do is just a translation one so
it's good for all skin tones but it was
quite scary to look at at first because
like pink like pew a pink they don't
smell of anything either
oh I've forgot contour I'm gonna have to
go back a step rewind
I'm not going to filter this video
either and pretend that didn't happen
because I'm going to be real with you
become just a real raw youtuber like
that save every fake youtuber ever now
you can see different to the foundation
to be set now I've removed a bit you can
actually see how good the foundation is
I'm glad I did that vacuum is a beauty -
okay I'm going to use this brush
rocontour as well it's like a liquid one
I don't have liquid contour some kind of
improvising as well
it is way too dog
I'm not going to take you to Friday now
because I think it'll spread a lot so
let's leave that I'm not sure what I'm
doing subscribe let's cap blending well
they don't do contour so I had to go for
a darker foundation so I don't know how
this is going to go I already know it's
not going to go great whatever I think
I'm panicking oh my god is not home to
fix this I've just got a lot darker than
I should be oh wow I don't know how well
woods on camera because the camera
emphasizes a lot of things but in person
that looks fine now and it just looks
more bronze and it did before that it
looked before
and now I do intersect it with this
powder so I'm thinking that doing that
will actually lighten it up a tiny bit I
mean you do that Foundation for contour
it's successful that you can do that
definitely but I'm what I did was I went
in with too much because I didn't
realize how well it like would blend and
how a little bit goes a long way I
really like this powder I really do it
does a great job of setting it like my
skin feels completely dry right now and
it feels like very firm in in place that
foundation won't come off another point
that's necessary to make is that it is
extremely expensive this makeup for the
amount that you get well not extremely
expensive but it's expensive I mean the
foundation was like 14 pounds and the
powder was like 12 pounds and basically
for this full face of makeup
I'm not even full full face book for the
face of makeup it came to like almost 90
pounds from wash I'd loved the day that
I bought all of my wash stuff and it's
so funny to the woman in store was like
she was testing all this stuff on my
hand and she'd like put the call around
I'd be like yeah that's fine I'll have
that I was like yeah I'll have that I'll
have that
yeah sure I said a mascara throw that in
as well and she was like oh you hope
you're going to get all of that today
like you don't want to wait cause she
was really confused as to why I was
buying it without even looking at it
properly
obviously I was doing it for a testing
video so I didn't want to actually test
them out and for the testing video and
she was just like you like you want all
of them I'm gonna eat my fingers the
highlight looks like white pain which
makes me feel it's going to be really
take minted and really excited to try it
again I don't know how much to use
so I've just gone for a big old dollop I
feel like this is gonna be really good
oh okay I really like that you can
choose how pigmented you want it to be
as well so if I get patent this and be
like not pigmented at all last about
five minutes but if I was to stop like
ten seconds ago would have been really
pigmented I big-time approvals that
highlight it's so versatile you can
legit do what you want with it like how
pigmented you want it where you want it
to go it's easily controlled you get a
lot of it as well I was saying before
how you don't get a lot of the products
but the highlight saver you're barely
use any you get the same amount as the
foundation so think about how long like
this would last you so funny if I ever
where nose highlighting videos I get so
many comments like what's on the end of
your nose and has she been splitting a
line of coke like yep that's yeah well
done I'm sick of being natural let's get
some obvious highlighting out keep
building this bitch oh okay I like done
so the how I stood I approve that
highlight I think so far it's our
favorite things if you're going to buy
one thing from lush make it the
highlight in my opinion it's all about
ointments now and I got a gold eye color
and it's a cream shadow as well I've
also never used cream eyeshadow before
this is eyeliner however she said at
loss you can use eye shadow eyeliner
eyeliner is eyeshadow because it's all
like cream hi I've brought you a bit
closer I look a lot dark now as well I'm
not actually to start the cameras just
making it look like I am this is also in
the shade fantasy
this is extremely pigmented I love it so
I want to apply this by itself first and
then I'm going to use like a dark shade
from another palette possibly like the
Naked 3 palette and just try and use
another color with this I love to see
how it will look I'm going in with black
heart for the Naked 3 palette which is a
really dark shade I'm going to see if I
can smoke this out and see how it will
look it's official what you can't do is
mix the powder with the cream shadow
properly or light very well but I can
like put it above it and it will look
fine but it just won't mix with it which
I thought might be obvious but I started
give it a go anyway I mean I didn't do
that for its look amazing it's a testing
video I'm just trying all different
options over there and telling you what
you can and can't do this isn't supposed
to look like an A+ like piece of work
afterwards and I'm just saying that with
something really bad job I'm going to
now do the same on the other eye balm on
a film app because it will be the exact
same process and I still need to blend
this eye out it's like every time I try
and blend it it like cakes because the
cream eyeshadow like dries and it comes
off in like flakes when I try and blend
it but now I am going to order the
mascara
it's called eyes right and looks like
that so it's a really small wand screw
sure don't if you can see well it's all
cakes increased in that area and you
like flaked off in the inner corner of
this eye here it just completely sticks
to your normal eyelashes I just make
some black just make some a darker color
it doesn't lengthen them or anything
like that but it also doesn't make them
clumpy so you can take that either way
okay this is what the mascara looks like
if I move my head up a bit like this
ignore the eye shadow again as for the
mascara I can't really fault it it
literally just took my natural eyelashes
and made them darker we're not gonna
have we've got one final thing which is
a seal lipstick I picked up the color
power it's like this deep red color
again the colors don't really go well I
just wanted to use like we look
pigmented colors so you can see them all
separately so I had a look on the lips
and how to look on the eyes this isn't
supposed to be a makeup block you
supposed to be like testing everything
like
oh wow right so in conclusion I actually
do really like the lush makeup overall
especially the highlight and especially
the lipstick the lip product I
absolutely love them they are so
pigmented but they are also so smooth
and silky I love it and also what else
the foundation was great translucent
powder the only thing that I didn't like
was the cream eyeshadow but that's
because I think I blended it with a
powder which was a mistake but it also
does mean that if you can't blend it
with a powder it's not very versatile
you can't really do much with it you
just literally have to wear it by itself
mascara was okay Thiessen it kinda it
just kind of makes you natural lashes a
darker color as I said before well I am
but I'm more impressed and I thought I
would be all together the only thing
again is the price I don't know if it's
worth prideful not I feel like Rimmel
and Maybelline and L'Oreal and stuff do
things that are better for the same
price but none of the drugstore brands
seem to do lipstick like this I can't
even explain what it is that I love
about it I just feel like it lasted so
long
I'll see you in my next video yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
