or the dhole alloted doing when I was at
Primark and you all guessed correctly so
well done for that and I'm testing
Primark makeup and they all wanted to
make through Primark this very
interesting and so we're going to
testing them out and something that they
have which is extremely interesting it's
the oval style brushes like that so
let's say I'm pathenger
okay so it was hard to test out the
colors in Primark but I'm pretty sure I
was an ivory color so we're going to try
out the ivory foundation and see how it
goes
this Beauty Blender with two pounds by
the way the result publishes articles in
a little worms crystallize holder
I will they I'm going to replace it with
my natural beauty blender with a little
sand okay it's a lot more dense in the
actual beautiful endure okay so we're
going to see if this actually blends in
problem okay the m1 is extremely
extremely dense
it doesn't blend as well as the actual
beauty blender to the sole reason that
it is too dense like it's pretty
accurate Coulomb as well as far as color
matching you go as you listen to the
whole face of this I did try out the old
brush so I will do a second layer with
the oval version I wasn't going away
we're doing that because the foundation
isn't like extremely small coverage at
all so we're socks like this is a
knockoff and from the actual original
oval bushes so we'll sell it it's
extremely soft switch so besides this
blending brush was 4 pounds I think I
like that whole thing is it pulls a lot
of you under eyes I pick quite a lot of
your skin like grips it really well so
if you tried like went around it like
you're actually right ass I preferred
this to the beauty blender 100% begin to
restore there is too dense and the
foundation was to help 50 okay once we
want to conceal an X and I got this
thick concealer in the same shade of
either a slap from I'm using and this is
90 P as well so very inexpensive but the
foundation is actually pretty good like
I'm actually quite impressed with the
foundation
I also used a little oval brush for the
small water concealer and this is two
pulsating again they took on the face
quite a bit but the lot streaky at all
but it is blending really well actually
this one thing easel concealer is in
ivory the same shades of foundation it
ever just slightly lighter than the
foundation which is pretty good because
it right into the eyes but if you don't
like your consumer to be lighter then
get the shade darker I say for tests and
output all right
that's what I've done I think feel
sticky so I'm going to you see
mattifying press powder to fix that it's
two pounds and again in a strange ivory
got pretty sturdy packaging as well
who's a little really excited to try out
as well is it growl soft its interest
rate so hard to hold that those drops
about five times okay this is actually
brow cream so it's not foreground gel
and it's like brow cream so much more
time that out okay the powder is in the
shade ivory again
but it I know if you can save it a lot
darker since the foundation and
concealer
it's quite all right
it doesn't seem to be driving like a few
dry areas that it's not sticking to at
all
honestly I are extremely impressed so
far okay so my face is all mustered out
now so I'm going to UCF contour and
globe check it 3030 and it has a browser
to scoop and shimmer to highlight a Brit
likes to be set to a sponsor and
highlight or contour highlight don't
need this to consult in the work very
well again my computer shows up
extremely bold on camera when it's not
in real life I can't be bothered you
know what that will do is I'll go
so this contour just does not work for
me and I don't know why I think it just
just look it's a really natural
highlighter I started my house
completely dead will come in dresser a
hedge backwards however I killed it last
night and then haven't brushed it
against and I'll go like boom and I
don't want to happen - by the way I
always try this with my boots blender
and see if it fits in it if it doesn't
we'll be so happy
oh wait little cooler side K would be
splendid world with like two pounds so
next for the eyes I want to be with
nightshade I pumped and it was too
perfect
it's okay pinky Brown old gold
attendance policy I don't really know
what's good this is a assortment in
there but they're all around the sink
wash a lot of those pigmentation not
assistants
okay this white is terrible oh no no no
no no no pigmentation whatsoever like
no write a powerful one is not create
and see if that improves or will cut old
milk just know it's not working I don't
know and I definitely don't recommend
that it just nothing showing up why
don't I can see that I haven't replied
to the best visitors gave up halfway
through book just don't do anything now
okay
sticking with the iron voice Charlie's
sultry so stylish with included glue for
one pound I haven't applied false
eyelashes made time to my life I usually
just go from scarves so this is closely
interesting or I use that individual
lashes
I have tried so hard to make these
Russians work and is just lanthanum it
isn't happening so yeah I don't know it
wasn't that was just my eyelash applying
skills or whether it was because of the
brand of eyelashes but I just don't rate
them personally but I'm good after give
more anyway so excuses okay it's not
that I'm really excited to try out its
this brow cream it was how much was it
one pound fifty and in this pack you get
brow cream and a really good angled
brush boom sorry about this probably
scarred you for life but we're gonna
have to be this close because we're
doing in detail of now my brows I hate
the brush well you tell me isn't it dark
just a bit smells little but Jesus
Christ oh this is a no I couldn't even
make it go any lighter than this is just
as light as it could go
sixteen was bold anyway if you want to
really out their looks and definitely
get neom brow cream to be fair I could
have got it in light ground but that was
I thought that might have been too light
so I'm gonna in dark brown because there
is no mid ground which confuse me unless
it also low notes and moisture in their
lip products and these are part of the
Velvet Matte lip stick collection so I
have the actual lipstick crayon and then
I have these line pencils the liner is
War Powers and the actual crayon is two
pounds also people watch your until this
point hopefully you enjoy the video so
please press the subscribe button to see
more videos like this I like a look of
this lip crayon looks like creamy will
see what I was really good really
clearly really used to fly I like it I
look really good right now
why do I like you so much with products
that is Debbie news today I'm Ashley
this probably looks my eyelashes like I
don't know if you can see but they're
just completely come off at like the
edges here so don't get the eyelashes I
would say that if I'm in my prime of
testing video honestly overall I am very
impressed
I really like the highlights and it was
really natural um I like the lips a lot
really creamy really I would say working
on the eyebrows working on the hours
working on the eyeshadow for everything
else is pretty good and I digits realize
and I forgot to get blush so sorry about
that but also these bushes here are very
good and the Beauty Blender was okay if
you contribute to blend the hold up get
it but you've reached it under itself
with heroine to rock so yeah that is
everything
have a beautiful day and a would life
