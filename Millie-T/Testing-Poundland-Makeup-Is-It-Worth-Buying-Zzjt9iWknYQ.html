my first ever testing video I'm really
excited but I don't know how this video
is going to turn out in terms of how
good the makeup is going to be and it's
obviously old makeup here is a pound
I've got some pretty interesting looking
makeups I hope you'll enjoy this video
as you're watching it if you do please
hit that subscribe button my all-time
goals of hundred thousand subscribers
and we are getting closer and closer
every day to where I am Oh God hundred
thousand subscribers oh my god and also
leave a comment below and let me know
what you think this makeup from what you
think in this video because I read every
single comment really quickly there
isn't a low to make up here because they
were really low on stock in Poland and
so sorry about that
and yeah let's go ahead and it turns out
don't thought getting foundation and
concealer from pound I might bit get a
bit pricey so I got a foundation and
concealer duo so let's see how good this
is that's really good packaging all
right we're off to a good start
got it all right so this is cover and go
by collection that's pretty cool okay so
the foundation and concealer duo it is
actually a duo if you take the lid off
here you've got concealer in the top and
then obviously you want to screw it
you've got your foundation that is
pretty cool it's going to go straight in
with your concealer and see how it goes
it's absolutely no payoff we already
apply it to my face
ah
by the way I am NOT a professional
makeup artist my makeup skills on
amazing and that's a lot terrible
they're not amazing so there's just just
a short little disclaimer out there
right this is so hard to find someone
ever uses brush before it's it only
bushed it'll work with concealer like
that so I always use them liquid
concealer
now I'm going to go in with an artiste
type face puddle brush to blend it out
as is so hard to blend
I'm so used to doing them liquid
concealer this isn't believe me I got a
minute okay okay that isn't bad you know
what it doesn't seem to blend so much
the start but then once you really get
the momentum going that begins to blend
really nicely actually
for power month I mean this is pretty
good okay the foundation it comes out in
blobs like you can't really control the
amount and take out up you couldn't at
first anyway so let's just give this a
go I'm just going to play straight from
the brushes why not okay
Wow a little just cleansing like a
little two splendas or don't go
overboard if you do get this oh my god
okay so think I'm pretty much done as
far as the foundation goes and it's in
terms of coverage the coverage is like
amazing I'm not blown away by it you can
still see redness of some sort small
spots I have here and and it is a jewel
kind of foundation like I turn my head
like this and do that I can see a little
bit of a glow here now if you want to
save money on highlight then so I'm
going to use blush next and this is Miss
Beauty London blusher and I'm going to
go into the Real Techniques blush brush
wash brush don't mister this is kind of
a regular even Barbie like pink and I've
got apply that to the apples of my
cheeks if I don't drop it first and I
dropped it welcome I'm not great at
playing blush by the way I don't really
love lush along so it's not overly
pigmented and I did pick up a lot with
the brush if you want a pigmented blush
not a way to go but if you like
something more subtle the way to go and
in terms of blending it's ever so
slightly patchy for a pound it's not bad
yeah it's not bad this Real Techniques
blush brush I found it's so out of my
brush with it blush blush brush wash I
find it really hard to play posh with it
so to contour I won't be using the again
miss Beauty blunder and bronzer in
number one miami glow by the way if
you're on you're looking for an
expensive makeup and you need a really
good bronzer the NYC bronzer in and
sunny is amazing it's like three pounds
highly recommended and no one else
remember there's a huge youtube craze on
the NYC bronzer like 2013 I do I'm just
gonna start off with a line and then use
another
one thing because I've lost my angled
contour brush Evers is slightly patchy
on the forehead area because my fire
kind of dents in in places and it's
collecting in the dent makes sense
doesn't it great makeup terminology
there Millie by the way if you want a
makeup tip I learned this from Kyle
Jenna's makeup artist and don't drag it
down like this when you contour in kind
of working up face it gives it a more
muddy effect when you go down which you
don't want that blends a little bit too
well let's go on to eyes now so I'm
going to use mascara and this is
Manhattan first I love mascara okay so
one thing that this is doing really well
is separating my lashes absolutely no
companies however is doing nothing to
lengthen the lashes it starts all
doesn't lengthen them what separates the
lashes really well
manehattan mascara I actually kind of
recommend it if you want sort of lashes
Lily are you sure it's subtle in the
amount of times I've said it I'm pretty
sure okay are you ready to this one I'm
so excited I picked up a lip gloss and
metallic lip gloss is so ugly well I
think it's a way for me anyway would not
suit me green blue purple can win a
metallic effect so let's go with that
and this is Phi and w7 as well it's got
a really thick consistency as well so
uh-oh it's actually green and glittery
you
it's got a kind of brown undertone and
then every time your lips hit the light
it gives off a kind of em green
glistening little effect
so temps to do a hundred layers
challenge with this and it just keeps
getting more and more pigmented as I
build it over I shadow and this is some
gray eyeshadow it's the only a shadow
they have so I'm gonna work this into my
crease and dodge it off that and I've
got some eyelashes to do as well oh this
is way too big for a crease floor brush
not blush brush I'm not blending
extremely well it's for the color pretty
nice color for the crease a trick for
hooded eyes if you work it into your
crease instead of just do me like a
rainbow exactly wave creases try and
bring it out a little bit to the side
like this and it just makes your eyes
look more awake and kind of disguise is
the hooded effect and now for the grand
finale from wrong please Miska too
 and fabulous paper set lashes
aren't knees gorgeous it followed me on
snapchat you will have seen these lashes
and if you don't have acrylic nail
almost went then absolute disaster oh
damn thought they were stick on but I
left after my eyelash glue and I'll
bigger have any this is the grand finale
with the lashes aren't they wonderful of
hound well spent of course I don't
really know what the point of these
lashes is they are literally made out of
kind of confetti type paper and I get
they would go with very few outfits but
they would go with some outfits and so
yeah that actually concludes today's
poem and testing makeup but before you
