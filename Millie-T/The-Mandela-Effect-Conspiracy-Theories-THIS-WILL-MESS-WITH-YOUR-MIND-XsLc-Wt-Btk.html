video is probably the most excited I've
ever been to film a video because it's
on the Mandalore effect and conspiracy
theories which is something I absolutely
love to death and prior to this video I
looked up the mandala effect obviously
but something an example in particular
and it has messed me up I need to do
with a Mona Lisa keep watching and I'll
explain but if you are new to the mother
or effect I'll quickly explain what it
is
so the mandala effect was named after
Nelson Mandela after thousands hundreds
of thousands of people all over the
world with no connection believed that
he died in prison in 1983 when he never
did there was never a news articles
never anything to make them think he
died in 1983 in prison other than the
fact that he was imprisoned but he never
died he actually died in 2013 and these
people that leave them Nelson Mandela
died in 1983 even recalls seeing news
articles and news broadcasts announcing
his death so many people and but there
was never anything apparently you know
all the ceased to exist so that is why
it's called Mandela effect but there are
also other examples the Bernstein bears
if you are from America you'll be
familiar with them if you're from the UK
probably not because I wasn't familiar
with them but a lot of people leave that
steam was spelt ste i n however it is
actually Brian Spain Bears were spelt s
t AI N and so a lot of people have been
really messed up finding that out in
America and I was watching a YouTube
video on Mangalore effect the other day
and I'll link it below if I can find her
and she actually said the first I'll
explain the Mangalore effect and and the
Bernstein Bears said that went to a
younger she used to spell the Bernstein
bedsprings stain with an A and a teacher
always used to correct it by crossing
out the a and puttin an E and and then
she went home and looked at the
Reinstein box like the actual copies of
them to look at the name Bernstein and
she saw they had an e so she was out for
God's sake I'm wrong so from then on she
always felt it with an
and and then obviously later on she was
pretty messed up when she found out that
it was actually always an a when she
vividly recalls seeing it as an E okay I
want to go real quickly of least ones
and then there's one that really messed
me up that I'm gonna leave until the end
really mess me up because I strongly
believed it was one way when it really
wasn't and I almost cried when I found
Alex it was scary scary stuff and okay
whew from America again jiffy peanut
butter we all love it right and it test
ourselves up and jiffy peanut butter yep
no it's jiff jiff peanut butter never
has been Jeff EGP doesn't even exist
you've made it up it's Jeff
Febreze we all look the adverts they
blindfold them bring them into a room
getting to smell this disgusting house
but it smells good because it's sprayed
it with good old Febreze it's felt like
this right wrong
it's felt with money I don't know these
are all ones that I've kind of
experienced some angle effect with
myself and some of them most of them pop
of Einstein bears and but I really
thought Febreze was spelled with two E's
this the Queen looks into the mirror in
to know why and says mirror mirror on
the wall right no she says magic mirror
she's always said magic Mira Mira Mira
doesn't exist it's our thing um never
has been it's always been magic mirror
what's the word thing is when you look
in other languages that's obviously snow
white if you watch it in French and
option it translates to mirror mirror
it's just the English version in the
English language that says mirror that
sees a magic mirror okay anyone your
sketches shoes that breathe always had
that Pattaya thong when you're a look at
and it's felt like that that's the logo
something weird about it to me there is
I thought I had a teen it was spelled s
ke t CH ers I think and but no it's
never had patina ever okay okay okay
okay now on to the one that has M
to milk the most and I saw this and it
really really me up okay mmm the
Mona Lisa probably the most famous
painting in the world priceless you know
protect with bulletproof glass in a
museum and proper the wife's got special
lights on it that precious and special
it's so well known I'm really familiar
with it because add a kid I used to
watch Gennie in the house
shoutout to everyone I watched in the
house of Nickelodeon what a show a deal
a deal a deal
nabil the genie he was funny and there
was one episode where they had the Mona
Lisa the actual painting and they did
something wrong with it and you're being
shredded into a million pieces and there
was also one on was the waverly place
where he had to put these smile on Mona
Lisa
something like that they messed it up Oh
however Mona Lisa doesn't smirk right
she never has smirks please tell me or
not the only one I swear I swear she's
always being serious like this no
eyelashes no eyebrows but she had a
straight face not this smirk this oh my
god this is the original picture that's
not right it's not right it's probably
she doesn't she never smoked I swear she
never smoked I got chills so many chills
because she didn't smirk I don't recall
her smoking I have vivid memories of her
having a straight face on two
explanations as to how this might come
about the mantle of it
okay time travel number one quite
far-fetched what and a bit possible in
the future and you know how with time
travel if you go back and say if I hate
my grandma and I was I right what a time
travel and would he kill my grandma the
it would have a negative effect on me if
I killed my grandma it and another chain
of events after that would never cook
place ie my mom being born ie me being
born from my mom because my mom came to
my grandma but it's not gone why never
existed she could never have my mom who
could never have had me so I will cease
to exist so they say that time travel
and maybe so much time traveled and
change
logos and that financial gain not sure
how but maybe I make it their own and
then obviously make money from it so one
theory is that people that experience
the mandala effect may have like slid
between parallel universes and parallel
realities so after going up in the
universe rate was bernstein bears for
example one day song some people may
have woken up find themselves in the
universe where it was spelled Bernstein
bears
another thing is that it's maybe like a
glitch in the matrix so we are kind of
part of a computer software program and
there's a kind of software glitch that
calls in consciousnesses and I like
perception of reality so yeah they're
pretty far-fetched but it's still quite
interesting and then this other ones
where maybe it's just a misconception
but I know leave your thoughts and
theories in the comment section below
I'd love to hear about them then as if
serious video guys have a beautiful day
and don't forget stay positive bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
