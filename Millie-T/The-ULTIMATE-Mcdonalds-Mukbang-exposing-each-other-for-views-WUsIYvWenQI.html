is literally the ultimate mobile and for
this debut episode mukbang let's call it
we've got Jacob white the JPY yes we've
got Elmo films Spencer as well he's been
on this channel a lot and a new addition
hello everyone it's a waste we guys
gonna go through the topics so I tweet
you know my Twitter for you guys to give
us some topics to cover make them beefy
in deep yoga okay what is the difference
between PG each others what do you think
so I think we'll these PG chip is a
start-up for young yes they're still
making videos about ourselves into a
trap exactly oh you'll never live
responsibly maybe don't of it it's a
like a lot of impeaching youtubers
starting in like 13 minutes PG tape but
they didn't evolve they just kept that
character so instead of that audience
like growing with them it's like that
audience to have like a news they have a
museum audiences that we like I think I
was like grow with your subscribers
instead of just like putting on like an
act you're still like when like like I'm
even a month ago like you everyone
changes so much oh yeah Tracy so I had a
brand new with Disney a few years ago
and they thought my tone was completely
PG and I used to do reaction videos like
boy music leaves and they saw them and
we were like they got me to do so much
they were like delete this video like
there's like almost this video
name-drop any youtubers that you seem to
be really rude to the phone fixed I was
not very nice to me and many I really
wish that quad Northwest to Venus a
shout-out to James Charles and Nick
Crandall
James Charles is a smart fucking going
and people under arrest I really really
respect him no jumper it's reading
social media films like 15 grand one is
11 was really healthy saw some saffron
genuinely
the only the only thing I don't like
great about saffron is I feel like she
thinks she has like an authority over
other youtubers like especially big
meaty ow it's like the community like
ever interact with each other like do I
mean like hi how are you and she like
walks around with like a little manager
like Wendy just like doing nothing I
want to I want to drop the exclusive
story time here cuz I'll let you two
want to tell people to always get
comments about it always on live stream
system some of you might know that means
that we filmed a clap last year Savin
came on time and we buy the first time
that we got on so well like literally
were the same person it was crazy and I
was like Alicia I've made a friend for
life
my place is crazy and I was like only
two so Optima so I was like I'm
literally gonna be such a girlfriend to
this girl when I met someone I met
Spencer like a few months before I'm
through Spencer I met car made and a
sissy Jake
Mitch only hitch Westar there and
because Spencer and Tommy were friends
with them we were in like a massive
group so I ended up being in a big group
with Jake as well Sam has been existing
with Anna and Lucy and I was with
Spencer and kami and I saw someone talk
to her and everything still but yeah we
only really like a big group like
fifteen of us and Jake was in that group
as well and then
x67 was like being really off with me
and i was waiting for her to come to me
to talk to me because i didn't want to
ask her about it and that make me look
guilty in like it way you annoyed at me
and she'd be like no should I be
and basically she was really annoyed
because I'd been in the same group as
Jake I don't know if she knew how big
the group was would like 15 of us so she
just heard that you were like in a group
of jade and she didn't know house yeah I
didn't say one word to Jake because
these were all who would mean Jake it's
it's II because he knew that I was
really good friends with saffron right I
used like a misunderstanding so he
didn't wanna speak to me I didn't I was
a machine which I wasn't really speaking
to him I think she got the wrong idea
hey what everyone's sad cuz I just like
misunderstanding yeah he was your
opinion on the socio partners to us I
was like really scared really like I was
really like intimidate you don't like
you think we're into it I think a lot of
people I like because like like I feel
bad when he's balanced all the things
we're gonna be rude to them because I am
no deals we like cocky and either to
each other like we really like grossly
to the song I like we got so deal each
other
I like God in our life and a funny but
like I thought it was like the
friendship group you know I didn't think
there was like any possible where you
could like be friends oh yeah like we
did like if your weights like each other
when we don't speak to anyone I have but
it's not like that absolutely right
that's all now do a quick analysis about
on YouTube channels just like really
quick and just say how you feel and what
you doing with that and if you're happy
or if you're not yes I've only been
doing it like coffee and I haven't
really found like why I wanted to do
that like I do really enjoy it like I
really enjoyed it but I thought it is
I'm still waiting on that thing right I
feel like I'm gonna find something like
I might meet again yeah mama did it but
five and a half years it's a hard for me
because I feel like it and it's
obviously don't make a video doesn't
make good time are you I was used to
make much
I say my opinion I think it with you
because you're like the 10 out of 10
like like a lot of your fans are like I
like young and like what you want to do
that's not really what they want it's so
hard because it looks like in order to
get a demographic that want that so it's
so tricky because it's your job so you
have to do it's kind of the same thing
like when I started I was like I made
like makeup videos like it was like how
to do that you know and I wouldn't say
like I've lost interest but like I'm not
I don't want to make the same do you
watch interesting that kind of yeah yeah
like I still love making videos like I'm
not filming anything all about like I
don't like doing it the same thing and
like a lot of people don't like what I
want to do yeah I'm kind of tricky
because we ordered McDonald's and then
the dessert oook like an hour to come
after that
so then McDonald's is not cold oh my god
the social climbers Afridi's Boop which
is me Jacob Spencer Rodney Lewis Ben and
that's where Jordan comes in he we were
all friends obviously would be really
really close for a while now and there
was a point in all my friendships where
I got really talks it can we didn't mean
it to be but we all got like we just all
became very selfish just within the
group and we've realizing now who fixed
and it's changed so much ravenna like we
are just crazy to come out of our shells
it's Louisa carbonates crazy help those
we all laugh oh yeah
social climbers hotel so much they ship
out and the thing is we should all be
living together right now but this is
where the situation comes in and this is
why we aren't all living together so
basically so what happened was Jordan
Comi became really really close and
started to isolate themselves from the
group like a little bit
even along it was mental though it was
mentally the word middles it was like
just them two and only them too and
that's when it became very selfish as
well and he asses back Peter we'd all
been planning to move out together for
such a long time it was like the main
thing with all was right it was the
biggest yeah
so John economy plan to move out - seven
- and we've been playing - all move out
together for so so long but they didn't
tell us they like told us they told me
yeah yeah but they knew they were
telling us but it wasn't like guys like
this is well you have nothing I'm really
sorry yeah it's like they just openly
talked about Emma like oh yeah I mean
calm you need me to the halo tower in
Stratford by the way like to my face to
get a reaction out of me you have been
spending and calling calling us they
agents finding houses trying to sort out
all these licences tried so hard T worst
feeling he's caring about someone so
much I'm not getting me back yes
nicely worst feeling so what the hell so
looks like it's me Spencer and Ben movie
now thanks at times but speaking to Jake
by the expecting that happened yeah me
Spencer event will keep house as we
found a house we're about to move in and
communist commie and Jordan was positive
moving in same time obviously separate
part man and then Jordan like kind of
aired him but at the same time I was
beginning to kind of it was just stuff
the show that made me feel like he
didn't care about me at all and that was
really really sad I still love the kid
though Logan who was really rooted he
once what I have fun story said you guys
maybe the Capetian is yeah so basically
at sits here I don't know into you
shouldn't no idea any because what I was
gonna let for the ban made the gabbie
