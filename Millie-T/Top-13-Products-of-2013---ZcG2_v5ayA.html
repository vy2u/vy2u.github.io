2013 there have been so many makeup
releases of 2013 that are amazing and I
just wanted to share my top 30 with you
so let's get on the video
best thing is by lush is is Sansa's lip
scrub it gives you complete a moisturize
lips because it just gets rid of all the
dry skin it makes you it leaves your
lips I'm tasting really nice and if I
open it up
do you last a long time as it in is in a
really big bottle and they retail for
five pounds but I got this for two
pounds fifty next I have the low yell
gum shines I absolutely love these so
much right now I'm wearing and this one
which is called Dada dragon fruit it's a
nice purple color as you can see you get
what you see on the packaging although
it is a bit more sheer but I just love
them so much they retail for seven
pounds each and they look great in your
makeup collection which is why I love
these and they are lip crayons as you
can see next I begin to be obsessed with
these because they were so great at
staying on your lips this is lip glosses
and these are the benefit ultra plush
lip gloss now this is the full only
full-size one I have and all the other
ones are minis that came to set thirteen
pounds and from six point five
milliliters in these small sizes and I'm
really happy with these so I have the
Nivea lip butters and I'm not sure when
these came out but they are absolutely
amazing if I open them up you can see
I've used it a lot well I've used it a
lot but if you can see not a lot it's
going down still flat the top smells
amazing and doesn't dry your lips out
and they simply just fully moisturize
your lips you can always trust Nubia
Nivea is always an option finally with
the lips you probably expecting this
every single beauty guru with I just
uploaded top 30 products 2013 I've
included these it is the Maybelline Baby
Lips now I have a confession to make
they had brilliant quality lips tinsy
lips lasts quite a long time three hours
I say at the most if you don't drink
coffee but I always eat every two
minutes so they don't last very long on
me and they moisturize your lips and
then dry them out to make you used in
law and then buy another one because you
think that they're working so these ones
do cool is amazing but not really
these my friends are a different story
Adrienne in intense care they a
moisturize . they and they're absolutely
amazing and one of them includes SPF I'm
pretty sure
so that just improves it even more
moisturizes your lips on holiday keeps
them protected the last ages and these
two are definitely my favorite lip balms
of all time all the ones are great
adding color
hello flawless by benefit this includes
SPF 25 and leave less your skin breathe
still and also you can see how much you
have left which is why I like this one
next one is wake me up by Rimmel I love
this one because it gives you great
coverage but feels really light on your
skin and also lasts all day and doesn't
and make your skin shine it just gives a
nice dewy effect also start to skin I am
going for Mac's like sheer pressed
powder
open when you open it up you've got a
mirror I wish a lot of powders have
which I'm happy about because you can
transport it you also have a sponge and
to apply it with and the color that I
got really much rice again I've got nw20
but this one say it's NC 25 so I'm not
too sure next and finally for the skin
I have acts like cover-up I've got it on
now and I never run since morning and
it's only just starting to wear off
I have Rimmel scandaleyes showoff listen
I like this one it's because of the
brush it has it's got such a unique
brush that kind if you can see at the
end but this bush it means that you can
get it the really tiny eyelashes right
at the front of you right at the inner
corner of your eye I have the gr Danny
gold you probably never heard of this
brand but it is amazing I'm at I'm
making your eyelashes of normal and
separation so this is why this one is
also on my top 13 unless finalizing the
mascara I have the Urban Decay big fatty
mascara written all of this is because
it's from Urban Decay for one packaging
is amazing you get a light in a bottle
and when you put it on it works great
for your bottom eyelashes and it just
works really well with you our eyelashes
summer skies work against routers but
this one works with them and it also
goes and makes your top and bottom
lashes joint and we're kind of joined
together at the corner so it doesn't
look completely odd
I have the johnson's baby wipes here i
love these because cuz most wipes you
didn't make buffer than this mojit um
and then you have to wipe it again to
get the smudge away but this one just
completely takes it off and it's great
for removing the eye liner as you can
see I've got it done now so it works
great for getting it off well that is
right that is on my top 13 list and all
the other products I talked about great
