with artificial lighting and I am going
to be blind by the end of this video
because this light is so bright today I
have another wish video because I
haven't done one in a while and it's
also another one coming in a few weeks
because I've missed doing them so here
they are again before we get into the
video I do want to give a mention to 21
buttons as they have sponsored this
segment of the video but even though it
is sponsored by very rarely do
sponsorships first of all and also 21
buttons is an absolutely amazing app and
I genuinely really like it and I know
that sounds like I'm just saying that
because I'm working with them but
genuinely I think the concept behind the
app is amazing it's just an easy way for
you to find out what I'm wearing 21
buttons it's a clothing app and it's
available to download on iOS and Android
and what you do is you can go on the app
and find out what people are wearing and
the chances are very high that you're
like favorite social influences have a
profile and show you what they're
wearing because what they do is they
take a picture in the outfit upload it
onto the app and tag where every little
thing that they are wearing is from so
it might be these glasses you click on
the glasses and it comes up with the
exact link to the website where you can
buy them from 21 buttons is a
combination of a fashion app and a
social media app like just all combined
into one because you can buy and share
your favorite looks while also earning
Commission if anyone buys your outfit
basically you will earn money you will
earn commission from then buying the
outfit because you were the one that
referred them saying that if I upload
any of these wish outfits and there's
any outfits and I think are a hundred
percent worth buying I will upload them
onto the 21 buttons app on my profile
and you'll be able to find them and buy
them for yourself so if you do want a
quick way to go on to my profile it will
be linked in the description below so
you can just go straight there okay on
to the video now where I'm gonna be
unboxing wish clothes I ordered these a
while ago because which has hella
delivery time with the shipping it
literally takes like a month I've
completely forgot what I ordered but
we're just gonna dive right into the
parcels and give a review at a try on is
it worth it is it legit we will find out
a you inch sleeve
I'm gonna have to go into my order
confirmation and see what I order cuz I
have no idea what that is I think this
is just a dress now that cool is
gorgeous I genuinely love that color so
much like look at that pink like that
you think that's pink right then compote
to that pink it's so nice Wow
okay how much was this let's see this
was three pounds six fee legit I don't
know if you can see it there it was 20
pounds 60 okay let's analyze this
that's a hallow long neck strap they
seem to be so long let's have a look for
me I'm gonna show you how long they are
because I'm gonna keep feeding it
through my hand
yes I know but thinking about it if
they're really long you could Papa tie
them and they'd have a really big bow at
the back and I think I'd look good like
a statement I guess that's what it looks
like you've got the blue baby there with
a tie and then he calls Darla like a
skirt so I don't want some boxing miss I
thought that it was a dress but after
wearing it it's actually like a romper
sooo like a place ooh and I absolutely
love them because if you're going out at
night and stuff and you want to dance
you still can you dr. eBay coming up but
it still kind of looks like a dress if I
do that that's the bowl I made it well
at large because I felt like a statement
bowl would look good I think it looked
better if these were like slightly
colored like that but they won't stay
like that and just go back to how they
were
yes okay so on this on wish I always see
these jeans promote so if they make the
ghost boom looks so good but I think
it's Photoshop so I already done for
myself just to see push-up leggings
these definitely are poor shocked though
because I don't know if you can see it
looks like you made your like bow cheese
just like sit on this area
it's like structured if that makes sense
so I can't see these work gene time now
and they're not coming up okay so the
first thing is that they're not
high-waisted and if you've been watching
my channel for a while or watch quite a
lot of my videos you'll know that I
can't stand things aren't high waist
because I always find myself trying to
force them to go up especially after a
fat meal but I haven't seen the back of
them yes so maybe I'll work wonders
we'll see probably not what we can help
I'm so confused because that hasn't done
anything
that's so unflattering supposed to do
the opposite I don't weigh them at all
I really don't so yeah I ordered this
one cuz I knew that what would arrive
would not be what was shown in the
picture and will be a knockoff version
kind of my my eBay progress videos like
see how that's kind of pink can you
admire this kind of thing
please okay this is a two-piece a
bralette top and a high-waisted
miniskirt oh yeah check price three
pounds 75 for this adjustable straps and
adjustable straps
bralette like that rose gold because I
wanted rose gold I seem to be like you'd
pink in a minute but it's not sequins or
anything like it should have been it's
like kind of reflective but it's more
just a shiny material if that makes
sense okay I'd have to try this on but
it looks to be pretty good pretty
decently especially three pounds 75 it's
like how can I even complain for that
price
how are you so cheap how can you go into
Topshop and find a sippy cup
with some basic white girl for when it
would like only love laughs like 15
pounds yeah you can buy three four
outfits that aren't bad quality for less
than 10 pounds from wish yeah and then
this is a minute ago as well it's like a
shiny material again okay this one is
the going out kind of outfit I love the
style off the top and even the diamante
bail I feel looks good and doesn't look
tacky or anything
however the skirt just doesn't fit it
fits here okay however on the thighs
it's just very time very time so yeah
there's absolutely no chance with this
curve fitting but I'm definitely keeping
this top because I really really like
you I love the look of it it fits nice
it's complementing I like
did I order my dad a new work shirt or
something this is horrible
I wouldn't have ordered this oh no I did
maybe it looked good on I'm not too sure
but it's just a very oversized shirt so
the self it has definitely exceeded my
expectations because it's not as long as
I thought it would be it is like a nice
size kind of mini ish dress but still
quite modest also you can decide how
modest you want a because you can decide
like how many buttons off you want to go
but I mean you could also put a belt
with this let's try a bit about does
that look good no reason number one why
should not be a fashion designer having
a mental breakdown I use my friends just
literally FaceTime me she's got her
cloud companies on the cold cloud
goggles
this is his second two-piece that I got
is I could fill that material I think
the materials interesting she's not like
velvet velvet but it's like smooth one
way and rough the other this is that
kind of element this is good with zip I
needs great so I approve and its
high-waisted it's my double approach
that looks nice actually the quality is
not bad and whatsoever need some really
good quality literally just like a
regular bra lap but it's not too
revealing at all it's quite modest but
also kind of like sexy at the same time
or I guess it's just that that nice
halfway when they're just a pull strap
so it's guaranteed to fix you can just
make it the perfect size and I'm really
sad because I really like this outfit
but it is winter and won't be somewhere
until next year it literally is like a
body con skirts we grips to everything
which I like I really like this and I
don't have anything bad to say about it
I don't think
then uses a maxi dress like a long dress
about sixty now we get into the more
expensive one this vid until luxury
items well you know I've just realized I
did a video where I tested celebrity
endorser products and in that video I
tested fashion lover and this is like a
sister product what I ordered look I
ordered this from fashion over and look
at the print right and the printer
material is exactly the same as what I
ordered from fashion over which is here
I wonder how that works though but this
cost like 2530 pounds and this cost
seven pounds six days so fashion doll
this kind of it can you offer so this is
a fashion Nova outfit looking thing with
the same design and I do really like you
but I expected to because I love the
outfit from fashion / which is
practically identical to this if this
really well although I do wish the waist
was slightly more elasticated but I can
always put a black belt on it and I'd
like improve it quite a lot and the
bottom of the dress literally just sits
on the very bottom of my uncle like you
doesn't graze on the floor whatsoever
it's nowhere near but it's not too sure
at the same time and why did I order so
many short
outfits when it's winter yeah literally
today's video I mean I haven't tried
them on yet but it's been such a success
it seems anyway just remember seeing
them I really hope that you have enjoyed
this video if you have leave it a thumbs
up and also something else you can do is
again visit my 21 buttons profile

be posting literally all my looks if you
do want my style at all or are ever
curious as to what I'm wearing on my
Instagram pictures it's all the 20 more
