hoping the audio quality would improve
this video but it received the
microphone and it's not come with a
battery that's really nice
I'm not sure if this is going to become
like a series on my channel but on my
eBay wedding and prom dress testing
video I had so many comments asking me
to do a review is the app which because
on the app they sell a load of a random
stuff for really really cheap prices so
you were wondering if they are too good
to be true
I ordered a coastal they're all in these
bags we're going to all package them and
see what we think also this video is not
sponsored by wish or anything like that
so if I don't like that products and
they are scam I will ruin them no I'm
joking I'm not gonna ruin them I will
just give a nice obvious review for you
I'm wondering which was simple if I'm
just going to box a polystyrene like I
mean so why abscissa there's something
in that okay roll ghost nigga probably
not because my microphone is absolutely
terrible because there's no batteries on
the one that I ordered Oh glasses okay
we start from quite a nice one oh my god
okay these actually look quite good how
much should I pay fees these glasses
were one pounds apparently down from 28
pounds I don't know how accurate that
actually is and you have to pay shipping
as well shipping with literally a pound
so we're going to see what these like
how how are these one pound how are they
one pound I say okay we fit okay oh my
god my visions blue if I paid like 50
pounds for these I'd be a bit like my
other not gray when I paid one pound to
them it also depends on what you buy the
glasses for whether you buy them for how
they look or practical uses if it's a
practical use to protect you from UV
rays don't buy one pound glasses are
probably not very effective you might go
blind
the make it alive I've got no eyebrows
and it gives me horrendous flashbacks to
when I was like 11 and 12 years old and
I had
no eyebrows and I don't really want to
be taken back to that time oh no this is
a facial hair remover and I bought this
because I know it's gonna hurt Oh No ah
okay this is a facial tool I'm going to
tell you the price of it anyway just in
case you interested in torturing
yourself you know each terminal I did
buy a few calls as well but I don't know
which box burn all the trees in here I
go for it and I don't hurt too bad I'm
actually not too bright I'd like we'd
actually mix it out any hair it is safe
and it doesn't hurt as much as I would
my prove through okay I'm doing this to
show you how it works
close up the hope you can see okay don't
a face like that expand it close it
remember it also if you look close you
can see the hairs are caught on the
wires from my face okay this next one is
going to be a coordinator why is it
shooting by the way if you are watching
and thinking you know what I might
actually want to see some more videos
off this chick then feel free subscribe
we've just hit half a million that is
bloody insane oh it's this one okay this
is a cropped jumper with little laces
down the side it's great I lose
everything in my wardrobe and it's got
kind of like a really since lessee
inside which isn't like extremely soft
it's covered quite well but not going to
enjoy radical Islam inside this is five
pounds and down from 35 pounds I mean
tell you now that this was not ever
sewed if I found just in cake that's not
obvious imagine the pictures you know if
I bend called what pictures show so this
is a cordial plan am so impressed with
it if I did the material is really thin
either the materials pretty thick design
things have finds a pretty good fit as
well and beautified in child Creed Acura
but this one is a crop jumper guess what
in English this is extremely thin not as
good quality of the other one of these
iconic basically great quality this was
four pounds but it in comparison to the
one that was
five pounds it's like nowhere near squad
again to do the jump on training and
exert again I don't hate it at all
though to not look a lot thinner on this
but literally weight slices cotton
stitch the materials ever so slightly
scratch here which will just lead to it
being very uncomfortable after a while
so it's not this much wear it or not we
got hooked on it everything Cod that
might hold on to me I don't think it is
recording item if you didn't are
extremely worried imagine to fit it into
a bag of this size
oh I got a food a little bit oh yes this
is amazing ok I'll play what this is if
it's not what you think it's really not
worry fingers this is a hairdryer hat
connect your hairdryer to this thing
here it pulls air into it and it's just
really easy total oh my god this might
actually be the best invention ever
I will keep that and I will use that
depending on how effective that was two
pounds bloody insane from cash resources
Helen subscribing Lovelace what keeping
this I know what you're thinking
stop thinking my hair dry more petunia
benarjee how do we can do now these were
what Tyrell fetch yes I'm moving out
soon like I'm I'm gonna be used in
household I promise
feels male almost disappears again she
wearing the dress
everybody conjure you want to accentuate
your bodily features such as I want to
be from the front a normal pair of
shorts from the back then you stretch
these two around you bomb and it like
proper perks it makes it stick out but I
feel like you won't do it too much and
it will just want me particular return
this harness for a video I hope you look
stupid honestly and sing the reasons I'm
dying
oh my oh my god what's up boy style
please leave the opposite of what we're
supposed to have you couldn't even pay
me to go out with me I keep forgetting
everything that I've on it I'm not even
all this naturally well this is your
lens clips in your phone okay this is
really cool right you judges to try this
one out so you put these on your phones
and it change it to lentil I equip it to
phone cameras I changed it so I've got
the mobile device I'm going to take
picture of this microphone you're going
after the odd stuff on my desk it's like
cold this Drive and then you screw this
on I think whoa
no way that actually works okay this is
a fisheye one these are so inexpensive
as well can you see how it like clips on
okay this is a quite a wide one okay did
you get fisheye one but to the extreme
and the fisheye lenses were 5 pounds
that is so cheap what if they can sell
see what if you like absolutely
disgusting sale this is called the
computer mile ok a decrease in the
quality of your picture big time but
yeah she's can't complain to the price
it works on both sides you know that my
fingers well it seemed like sticky glue
from the parcels okay that's a goner
that's what it's like when it's fun you
can also reverse it to put it on the
front camera and to our bot oh my god
I'm so impressed by how what good these
are honestly
oh I got way too excited with the boom
enhances this is another one it is in a
different style spot but it's been all
why did you watch like them positive
tiny
got to be like massive I'll have to see
it when it's on that was 7 pounds that
well that was what expensive
like my part laughs these are the Pampas
another not like extremely padded but I
can see quite a difference with it like
it's definitely given more shape but
they do feel very artificial that is
original the fuel prostitution the
probably looks aureus okay after
retirement always address to be on a -
you really like the look at this dress
is kind like of course that styles from
lace up front but I've got to do a DIY
pop there's lace through the whole thing
okay
that's too much effort and just real
thought things couldn't get any worse to
try this dress on now as you can see
first of all failed trying the laces try
and tie them because apparently I
realized as I got to the end I'm
supposed to have two laters at the top
here's how can alter them or one of the
laces is tied down here so I gave up so
we've got one a long string of place
here if a train make this tighter okay
yeah that's really not help yet
obviously I wouldn't really rate this
massively it's a SmartWatch that looks
like quite good packaging and a feeling
that this was the most expensive thing I
was in marbella fingers like 13 pounds
someone say 9 pounds this was wasn't
with 9 pound down from 232 pounds I just
caught
it's actually up Norway's you're a
camera on it
okay the camera is actually functioning
but I don't know what the qualities like
yet not great rather than my is that a
memory card it's got a blue T put a
pedometer asleep monitor Facebook
browser Twitter what's up as far as I'm
concerned that is what I'm seeing today
the dog use any misleading from nails so
what you see in the thumbnail is
actually what you get okay that was my
wish hole I really joy to film in this
video because everything was just so
weird and just something new that I was
genuinely interested to tell the old
canal and overall I'm actually quite
impressed wait before you go before you
click off this video please just leave a
comment letting me know any video ideas
