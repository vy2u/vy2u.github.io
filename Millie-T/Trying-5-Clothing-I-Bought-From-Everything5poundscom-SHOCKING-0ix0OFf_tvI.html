going to be testing everything five
pounds calm I'm really excited because
everything was literally five pounds not
with us very much a surprise however
even like the shoes and stuff were five
pounds so I ordered a lot of shoes and
we're gonna see what the quality is
actually like probably not that good
thank god this is the box there's a lot
of clothes in there it just kind of
jumbled up and this is the first thing
for the price it's actually not that bad
first thing I like about it it's got
adjustable straps I always look them
because then everything is guaranteed to
fit if you can adjust it obviously Wow
revolutionary oh yeah it's just kind of
like a silky nightgown if you hadn't
already guessed like a nightie and I
don't wear nighties I don't really know
why I bought this I just saw it and I
was like hey that's something different
let's try it out cute so this is the
nightgown I really like it's really
comfortable I know I said that I thought
the lace would scratch but it really
doesn't know whatsoever but yeah I
really like the way that it fits I like
everything about it I do
next thing I'm just kind of pulling it
out the box okay this is another thing
that I don't know why I ordered there it
seems like I took the piss when ordering
stuff on this website but I did buy some
serious things just this I was too
intrigued not to buy I bought a blue
dress and it goes with a bell as well
just quite impressive especially for
five pounds and then we go down so this
fits like kind of fine right and then
you just go down then it goes to like
some lace and it's kind of flowering and
all the people that would actually wear
this though and it'll look good on it's
just definitely not my style and I also
don't think that I suit blue yeah I
don't simply very much honestly honestly
go for the make and stuff I these have
been stitched on really well they're not
coming up any edges or not that I can
see anyway no it's been made really well
to be fair so this is the outfit that I
thought I would hate the most and it's
not actually too bad
like it fits really well and especially
with the length like it just like grazes
the floor it's just above the floor it's
such a good length like this is some
people's fashion sense and if it's yours
I would genuinely recommend buying this
doing everything five counts calm well
done what their Oh so I ordered a black
jumpsuit and it's not actually like
black it is black but it's got like gold
flakes in it and then it's freely at the
bottom as well I think it goes freely
around the mid-calf and but yeah okay it
has it got adjustable straps and rather
last too much of an issue I just do like
adjustable straps because then you can
really like do your own thing with it
and you can make it fit especially in
this area depending on what are you
wearing you can adjust it I'm oh oh so
god I keep trying to hide my bra straps
and they keep making their way back up
I'm not wearing bra
I do wanna let you know that I really
exciting video coming next week
basically I wore one brand one clothing
brand for an entire week and it's a
pretty interesting clothing brand I'm
very excited to go live if you follow me
on my social medias like snapchat
Instagram you're definitely already seen
it I don't know if you'll be able to
remember though well yeah one store I
worked an entire week and I'm so excited
so alive I haven't started yet and I'm
also very nervous very nervous okay this
is the first thing I've tried on I don't
think I do like I feel like the frills
at the leg make it look like I have
absolutely no shape and just look stupid
as well that's probably why I don't like
frills anyway this is the black jumpsuit
that I remember ordering okay so wait
how do I work this so that's the top
it's got kind of like a cross front ish
but then I can't even hold it so
stressful so this is a front it's got a
cross front why I literally can't hold
it keeps falling out of my hands I'm
gonna literally grip it so this is a
front right there and then on the back
it's also a cross design and so that's
great cute although again no adjustable
straps so if it doesn't fit just right
it's not gonna look great and then it
goes down to a wide like fit on the
bottom and I like you though I do like
this a lot I haven't tried it on yet but
hopefully I like it okay this is Theo
the jumpsuit now I'm again I'm very
impressed with this it's like the first
time so I've ever worn that like fits
both the top and the bottom area I think
it's because the bottoms wide legs so
there's quite a lot of room for it to
like basically face like almost
guaranteed to fit on the leg but yeah I
love this I really do like I've spent so
much money on John suits in the
past and of all not fear and now I go
and spend five pounds on a jumpsuit and
it fits our really well like me story
behind now under the bags some of these
outfits were two pound fifty but I'm too
lazy to look so whilst I'm editing I'll
look for the two pound fifty ones and if
it is to power 15 you'll see a little
money that thumbs up sign and two pound
fifty coming out of his mouth if I don't
have the skills to do that whilst
editing anyway we went to the bank cuts
now instead a head hole interesting wow
that's a very small head space being
jokes oh my god this is oh he's got
shoulder holes ok so here's one shoulder
hole in the sleeve no the shoulder hole
of the sleeve I need some dress it's a
little mini dress that's cute I like the
color as well I think I expected it to
be a lot more cocky but it's kinda like
a grey far Pecola it's actually very
pretty that color I like it
hi if you're watching this video right
now I'm thinking you know what this
isn't terrible feel free to subscribe I
have a lot of videos planned especially
in the December time so keep an eye out
for that and if you want to join me and
watch more of my videos and just see
more of me do be sure to subscribe and
you can also follow me on my social
medias if my youtube channel isn't
enough I don't know why you'd want to
but it's there if you want to anyway
okay I've got it done I'm a monkey I'm
not like overly keen on it it's okay
like it's not terrible however it just I
don't know it just fits a little bit
weird I feel like it's complimenting ish
on the back though which is good it's
okay bearing in mind the price it's
amazing oh another positive thing that I
can say about everything 5 pounds calm
another positive thing that I can say
about everything 5-pound comm is that
the shipping time is very fast like when
I order from wish or ebay they can take
up to a month to comb but with
everything five pounds it took like
three days probably because all of these
are in the UK - it's an anyway and I
think I just threw up in my mouth as
much I'm not keen on the appearance of
it you might be asking yourself well the
million why did you order it I don't
know as much as I don't like the look of
it I appreciate the quality of the price
because it's got actual like cupholders
these tassels don't feel like bad
quality so it doesn't slip down it's got
little grips here and it's got grips all
along the bottom - and then there's a
fastener it's got like a bra strap
fastener so it's made really well
especially for five pounds I feel like
those cups are too big for my boobs oh
wow this feels like it fits really well
actually
although I am wearing a very push-up bra
right now so that's probably emphasising
something that's really not bad this is
also the top from before and I don't
hate this as well it fits so well and
it's got the bra strap back as well and
you can fasten it however Taiyuan so
it's like guaranteed to fear and it's
not gonna come down I guess you could
wear it strapless as well if you've got
these off because it's got like the gel
inserts stop it from slipping down it's
so comfortable the tassels don't look
stupid once it's actually on white like
this is such a success oh my god Wow I
feel like people are gonna be watching
this being like that's disgusting that's
disgusting that doesn't fit that's
horrible and I'm just hearing my whole
world like wow this is amazing
the design on this is ugly the fact that
it's a dress makes me like it a little
bit more however I really don't like the
design because material is disgusting
it's like a dirty material inside the
material of a but like a smooth
glossy and then the inside looks quite
dirty like and I think it looks white on
camera but it's like a very off-white
color when I look at it and yeah I don't
think I'm very keen on that however you
never know I might try it on and fall in
love might be I feel like you look like
some kind of optical illusion so that's
how it looks normally I look a little
squishy and but anything like move my
arms up and then put them on my waist
like that like then I
kind of like it then I kind of like to
fit a bit what straight with the Bell
it looks better now with the Bell now it
looks like that I actually rate this
it's gone from like a fall to like a
strong seven now which is actually quite
good
just with the Bell I'm kind of looking
at it in a more edgy way like maybe
something different the designs today
for no one else has tried it but then
again I don't like the feel of the
material I can't really explain it to
you cuz I'm not a fashion designer and
don't really know what I'm talking about
but I just don't like the feel of the
material it feels like old and it feels
like my hands that feel like dusty
afterwards if that makes sense actually
let's switch things up a bit
I'll unbox this and then we'll look at
some shoes because I've got some
interesting shoes oh why do I always buy
complicated clothing that I can't figure
out oh okay I understand it was just
wrapped up it's a dress and it's a very
plunge dress if this is a loose fitting
at all it won't be complimenting however
if it's very tight fitting around here
then it will be very complimenting I
think yeah this is gonna be interesting
anyway I don't I still don't completely
understand it okay this is a dress now
and I read this as well like it's got a
really good elasticated waist like it's
really tight on the waist which I like
all the thing I would say is that this
top is a little bit baggy so it does
make me look quite flat-chested right if
it was tired
oh the backs nice as well it's got a
crisscross back design shoes now oh
these are the shoes they are interesting
I remember I ordered these because I was
like I know for fact these are gonna
look hideous so I'm in love with like
the style of giuseppe's if you don't
know what just heavy sauces are these
are them here are some images I'm
absolutely in love with issues I look
the look of them I saw that these have a
sit down them and I was saying oh these
kind will like Giuseppe's as well as
they have like a strap along in front
this big buckle thing here so I was like
oh interesting to see what would come I
don't like them I'm not disappointed
though because these are what I expected
or these are my stiletto platform heels
so I just thought you know what why not
go all out and get a pair of fat heels
and that's what I did I would probably
never wear them and just because I don't
think I could walk in them and if you
can walk in these and you are extremely
talented and you
deserve a Nobel Peace Prize Wow that
made no sense or imagine if you went out
on a night out and then 10 minutes you
have to leave in your house you like oh
these hurt a lot and you had to go for
hours in these shoes
Oh more than four hours in my case
probably about 12 hours I can barely
stand up in these oh my god no I can
stand up in the midst of I could walk in
them but like they are so uncomfortable
and I don't know if that's because the
price or because of the actual shoe but
I'm like 99% sure it's just because of
the actual shoe because look at that
platform and look at that heel although
to be fair just in case you didn't know
the fact that it has a platform on it
actually means that it's a lot easy to
walk in because it gives you like it
makes you taller but gives you more of a
base to your actual thought so really I
think the heels only like that high and
in comparison to the actual shoe I just
I can't wear these though I would regret
it like 10 minutes later oh okay so this
is a one shoulder half strapless dress
and it's got sequins on it as well and
something that I do like about this is
that the sequins won't come off because
they are just like they only like attach
to the lace and they're not like 3d
sequins
they're like flat sequins if that makes
any sense at all and something I
definitely have fallen in love with is
this dress I am absolutely in love with
it I just love it I cannot move this is
5 pounds legit what the hell I feel like
this sounds some sponsored I feel like
I'm like I can't believe that this was 5
pounds
get yours at everything five pounds calm
it just genuinely wasn't sponsored
whatsoever I'm not affiliated with them
at all I just bought all these myself oh
now I'm learning the effect is tight on
the back as well like it fits really
well it's got a zip here as well to prop
like squeeze you into it I rate this so
much I came genuinely if I want a night
out I genuinely would wear this 100% no
doubt in my mind at all okay no I like
that oh oh wow that is plunge it seems
to be very plunge I feel like this is
gonna be one of those dresses where if
I'm like dancing and then I lean forward
a little bit like he's gonna just dream
like come out hmm what I will see is it
makes me look very rectangle and like
this I feel like I look like a rectangle
box and how
he does have a slightly elasticated
waist which is good as well these are
bad these actually aren't bad all these
like little ankle boots and what they've
got like an elasticated top kind of
thing and they are slightly healed
I love heeled boots I think they look so
elegant and go with literally any outfit
they go with a dress they go with
sweatpants they go with jeans literally
anything you can wear your boots with
and it makes any outfit look classic
these are not bad either
these are not bad at all I'm impressed
with these ones these are so nice though
all right they've got a little
embroidered D on the bottom as well in
gold looks a little bit tacky but no one
sees it satisfying the ladies actually
really nice as well it's quite
reflective I don't know if you can see
in the camera so guys that's it this
video look how much of mass is on my bed
if that look like there was absolutely
nothing but this a lot I just can't pick
it all up and I hope you enjoyed this
video this website was definitely very
interesting would I recommend this
website yes just be careful when you buy
stuff needless to say obviously wasn't
sponsored by the website or anything I
don't do these videos so sponsored or
anything like that
yeah hopefully you enjoyed this video
again keep an eye out for next week's
video I'm very excited for that one to
go alive and I will see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
