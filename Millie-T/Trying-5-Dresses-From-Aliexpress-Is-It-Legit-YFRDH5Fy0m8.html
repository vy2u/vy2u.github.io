lot of requests of you guys to test out
some more cheap website I've had wrong
way Aliexpress ebay wish and I've gone
for I'll Express Aliexpress this video
I'm not too sure how to pronounce the
name basically a website that sells
really cheap clothes and I'm going to
see this legit or not I left her on the
camera I look kind of brown I'm really
not a few days grounds in LA to do the
Hollywood hype thought who need some
cream right worn on this happened I
burned and peeled and I'm very red but
it looks Brown come with some reason I
don't know I've just mentioned LA what a
great time to plug if you do want to
follow me on my social medias to see
what I got up to in LA here's my
Instagram and here's my Twitter ok
packages now I have quite a few digital
one box women see what we got yeah
acrylic nails and deke packages I'm not
the best combination in the world right
package that looks really promising oh I
know what this is and it's not
impressive at all ok oh you supposed to
be like this but it really shouldn't be
doesn't look natural whoa so I love the
alien like cropped sweaters I think they
look so cool so I got this the actual
alien on it as well as like loose
threads everywhere and it's like half
coming off as well like at the edges
that was that's really not good
obviously I can't expect much because I
pay such a low price and I think
everything here was five dollars and by
the way I'm British but on this website
I pay for everything in dollars and
that's why I say dollars at the material
I mean the materials feel terrible at
all it's just kind of average I guess I
like the computer material book just
what you'd expect for the price that I
paid and but it's extremely heavy at the
same time it looks like it'd be quite
warm it's also got rips on the back as
well but they look just as accidental as
the ones on the front you've seen excuse
me I'm just going to do the 20 memory
because I might as well this is the
alien top and conceive noise cropped
I've had it on for literally so
two seconds and it's quite a hot day in
England and I can already tell that I
would get so so hot in this like
material is so so thick the alien symbol
as you can see just isn't really working
out I don't I hate the threads and
everything like that to do with it it
does look like it's about to come off as
you can see like it looks like you can
just peel it off like a sticker for the
price it's not bad at all but just as a
general review I don't like the ribs and
it's extremely hot I don't know what the
material is I've never felt material
quite live here but I'm not a fun next
package Oh hmm I think this is a
playsuit that I ordered oh this is cute
I like this yeah that was so I never do
that again Milly well it's actually not
terrible at all like you so baby evil on
materials not great it's not very
summery material really lightweight you
know you won't get too hot wear it on
the beach kind of thing I actually do
like you it looks like you've got quite
a good shape to it as well I mean I
haven't put it on yet but it looks like
it does it's a vast improvement from the
first t-shirt anyway it's got adjustable
straps as well I'm very impressed with
that
I do need a just will straps as well
especially when it's plunge so you can
like get it to the right height what do
you think generally what do you think
this is the complete outfit I am shocked
like honestly it is just everything
about it's so perfect the adjustable
straps mean that it fits perfectly in
this area the waist strap is a perfect
height it goes down to the perfect
length so it's not too sure like in from
the back in Turkish so it's not too sure
even for that - sure
even for if I saw this in a store I
would first of all definitely try it on
and then if it fit like you exactly how
he does now I would buy it like for way
more than five dollars as well I would
happily buy this so that you just feel
like it still and a half next one I do
absolutely love doing these unboxing
videos so if you do want to see more
major Swedish thumbs up or even leave a
comment below let me know what websites
want me to try out whether it's you know
wrong way wherever it is let me know in
a comment and if you see a comment
that's suggesting an alien that you like
give it a thumbs up to that comment so I
know what you want to see in the future
it doesn't even have to be testing with
you it could little bit anything you
want to see me that has a good crack
honesty me do a video testing Australian
candy Jonah see me fill the video with
my dad
Jacob Sartorius anything literally leave
a comment and I will do it I think we
need to change and I want to tell like a
range of different outfits or like
testing the jeans the tops the places
dresses and stuff so these are the jeans
that I got and okay I'm not going to
feel in the material of them obviously I
can't expect much because they were
extremely inexpensive but just as a
general review I dove in like material
to like embellishments like this rose
here it's tied on and I'm not really
feeling it because much like the alien
it's sold on in the same time this thing
like really thin thread and it looks
like it's about to come off I have to
try to want to give a proper honest
review so let's try them on I just we
put on this earth you mean people these
are the pants and with a price they are
absolutely amazing but as for like a
clothing item itself like disregarding
the price completely I mean they're not
the best just for the fact they're like
under I mean we fit okay they're just
really long and I'm like Zach and I'm
really sure I'm 5 foot 7 well they are
really quite along on the leg so I see
like barely talking to the air so they
barely took into the oil so the bear
looking so the belly's looking for the
boots and I definitely don't like about
them if this won't feel like the
embellishments symbols are sewn on
because they just feel like very papery
I know I mean I wouldn't personally wear
the book for the price they are for you
ok this one looks really really weird
it's extremely small part whirring well
either design on this I can't worry
about the material I mean I'm not like a
fashion designer or anything but this
materials are really really soon it's
not so much but yeah it is by quality
but it's extremely thin I don't even
know what it is Oh
to dress right okay I actually do like
the design on this though because it's
not going to like clog it's not like
sewing on or anything I mean you might
wash out that isn't bad I actually
really do like that again I do think
that it would wash out and the materials
extremely thin as well but I mean from a
distance it doesn't look like it was
cheap or inexpensive it looks quite
expensive depends how good your eyes for
things like this I really really like
this I hope it actually does look good
when it's on okay this one again is in
my room so I'm having to like stretch up
so I can put the whole of the dress on
the camera I would wear this as a dress
it's definitely too long to wear the
t-shirt specialist you are in like baggy
pants or something wise I just want to
look right
I again love the detail on this and then
gives too much clothes back as well in
terms of the detail I'm still a bit
sketched with the material - extremely
thin and something else I notice is that
this would crease extremely easily but
saying that I mean if you're going
somewhere for a beach-themed you need
something to throw over the top of your
bikini this is perfect it would drive so
quickly and it's extremely lightweight
as well house 10 would recommend I've no
idea what this is again I forgot
everything that I ordered so this is
like a Christmas to me no I don't even
think in Alva I'm just looking at that
I'm like brutal no not feeling that oh
okay I absolutely love this style of
dress so it's a high-neck dress that
goes down like that and it's a mini
dress as well and it's a sequined black
mini dress my favorite favorite kind of
dress short black dress the sequins
that's what I like you always client
really scratchy material and I think you
can hear this well I feel like up I
don't like not feel of it oh I mostly
cringe as well as a lot acrylic nails on
to like goes through them the zip cord
to test easy does it get stuck I like
that and there's something else I can
see this doing is because the sequins
overlap on the next bit I can imagine
that just like really really irritating
my neck and just like scratching it
constantly all right so this is the
spiral
dress now the material of this is
extremely uncomfortable is scratching me
everywhere right now I could not wear
this for more than like five minutes
without feeling extremely uncomfortable
however as for fit I mean it's quite a
bit of room in this area but after
everywhere else it fits perfectly
especially in the lower region just fit
really well however I did just walk
about the house in this to try and find
my camera battery charger and it doesn't
leave motor room to walk like it's
really tired not stretchy at all it felt
like if I would like sit down I would
like break it and it would just
completely rip Aliexpress is extremely
similar to ebay and the sensitive very
hit and miss you know because each
seller is individual so for example this
place is amazing I love it the material
is even bad quality it looks like it
will fit well I actually am in love with
this however the teacher and those jeans
were very dodgy but they were all the
same price who really does depend on the
seller I do hope that you enjoyed this
video anyway and if you are still
watching thank you it's so so much for
watching the entire video I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
