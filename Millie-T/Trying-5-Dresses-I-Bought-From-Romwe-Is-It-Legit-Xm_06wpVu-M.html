in time like a year and a half I film
with a different background because I
main magaluf right now so I sat down on
the balcony and decided to film I
apologize this is like a ton of
background noise the morphine using a
different camera where the microphone
isn't as good and I'm going to talk
about my dial under for this video as
well so this background is kind of ugly
but look how nice the view is like I
would love for that to be my background
as a video but I can't because the
lighting is terrible if the camera is
pointing that way so yeah that's my
first world problem also a lot of people
watching me film this video because
there's so many balconies over there and
they kind of watching but it's fine you
know I'll film with an audience so I
went onto wrong way and for a comedy
different outfits they averaged at about
5 dollars some more and some less so I'm
going to unbox them today and we're
going to see what we think before I stop
this video if you also want to see what
I'm up to in my life right now and get
to know me more as a person make sure
you follow me on my Twitter and
Instagram and even snapchat but I mainly
use Twitter and Instagram like them I
say this to you so yeah homie lawns if
you are bored have your phone in your
hand or nearby
I don't know okay first of all I know
you obviously can't expect much of the
price that goes for all these products
obviously they were so cheap but I'm
still going to review the quality some
and stuff but I do have to think about
the prices as well and I will okay I
will give me the packet on this t-shirt
and like oh my god this does not look
good
muley nigga oh my god it's actually
legit stuck together oh my god
look it actually stuck together
obviously again you cannot expect much
of the price but she's crying oh okay
it looks cool like from about if you
look like a mile away it looked like a
pretty cool t-shirt but up close I mean
not really
I listen to sound well like oh my god
and this 12 so this is the hardest part
and is extremely cross for the zucchini
top is very sad if I don't know whether
it's like to go down a bar because of
that I mean thank you for calling for
solitude
definitely go for it great vibe but it's
begin week up by the way like donkeys on
it stretches so much as well I just
really not feel I thought so much so oh
my god I was this okay this is a two
piece that's the top it's a pyramid
style top that goes sounds like a point
there and strapless like a bundle bundu
bandy my pronunciation is so bad like
sandals by now then we're just going to
go for extreme crop top again the
stitching some pretty well too oh no
move enough I mean I guess you could
cook these fists after the hanger and
these are the shorts and pretty sure
these are high waisted bohemian style I
went through a massive bohemian style
phase last be a world obsessed today and
I think I'm kind of getting back into it
again because that outfit is so perfect
to wear on the beach like walking along
it summer summer so this is the one that
I absolutely love I do the first thing
I've tried on my absolutely adore it and
it's not as cobbler thought it'd be it's
quite one actually what is beauties as I
said and then this kind of example point
four on to this out
why I can usually get such good like you
swear and this also doesn't come down to
whether like space in the world so yes
Paris so this is a swimming costume
shown costume to quite enter the minute
and I love hardly went something like a
really like modest outfit to being like
a lot more sexy than petunias like
depending on what value get I can get
some though extremely sexy looking and
they look so good
this is kind of one of those I didn't
park properly in a brought like three
bikini so if this fits well I will be
wearing this so I also want to try out
swimming costumes to have it one
swimming costume it's so long so so long
and then since I was like three for that
long right so this is a bikini and I am
honestly like completely in love with
this is going to actually in their
property near and I never wear swimsuits
but I I'm almost so much I look wait bit
it's so difficult well I absolutely love
the style of this when I get home I'm
going to buy so many Sindhu times know a
sunfish I'm going to be going on in the
holiday in a few weeks on stand for
crucial and I really like it yeah I've
never wanted to do before but I do
really like this is just all like bit to
tie on the bottom here but it fits so
well on the top so I don't think I can
actually wear this because it's very
very time on this area like it because
it was a bit more out like that but I
did it I did it all that is so soft
oh my god I love the look at this well
it's a like marble tie-dye
however always call it it's not smart
alright model it's a tie top as well
I love my titles I used to like living
them but I haven't owned one for ages
it's kinda like dark blue slush maybe
but I honestly am in love with that it
actually so soft as well
I'm till to save like a million times
better than that and I see this is
around $6 so and to don't write better
than that what about $50 more expensive
looking
oh and the reason I say dollars as well
as except for everything in dollars
because I think it's like an
american-style website so and everything
was in dollars
I'm actually feeling really optimistic
about this one I really like style Adele
I really like that watch me put it on
and look terrible just for to smile of
it so this is top the really nice
material it's not like fall to the
shoulders well I mean the holes are in a
pretty good place like top fits really
well material is absolutely amazing and
it's also tie as I said so you can
actually have it whatever hand you want
what I tend to do or like what I like is
the title go put it to April all right
like a tourniquet make like wheat crops
depending on what you opened one people
well together so yeah yeah I don't have
verified normal like how well what helps
us a lot
what I mean you could do to the camera
if you're also watching this video and
you are enjoying it please please please
make sure you subscribe to every may
thinks I do mostly style videos like
trying inexpensive clothes I don't wish
Aliexpress ebay literally so many
different places and it's more to come
in the future so stick around for that
and also give this video thumbs up if
you're enjoying it so far
self from all over enjoy the video I
just was like fuck off and I have no
idea why oh this isn't a ziplock bag Oh
use a dress oh okay and the padding
feels a little bit weird it's a tight
body chondrocytes them quite a popular
style you'll see on Instagram like an on
the explore page this style of dress but
it's like a blue one usually but I've
got to be read into it like this sticky
stuff around the past so I make sure it
stays like held up oh wow it's simple as
I thought well I think I do like to
color it I'm like quite intuitive in it
does it's good reserve I would find I
have a thing with its where the
receptors and support properties stretch
now so bad but they're almost quite
promising
I just hope it's like really
complementing quite like typing and
stuff make sure this pick here that I'm
not too sure how it will be a bit but
wouldn't you want to try it on anyway
and I almost hit my camera and love to
offer alchemy
in a red dress I will be keeping
environmentally well as usuai genocide
one identity of our focus now so what
what we are going to stop suits these
are whole muscle type so hi what the
like design exist ok ok one to another
dress now
yeah no I'm not feeling this dress and I
think you see guys like the camera picks
it up it's like I don't know it's busy
said and ripped t-shirt dress yeah yeah
it is
yeah I feel like the rip you know how
useful when you know how I would need to
produce you like put the rips in and
like do expression and then stitch them
up I feel like they just called parishes
and just like cut into it just like can
you can see the stitching like peeping
through as well yeah no yeah no I got my
boob goes it looks like a massive hole
there where my boob gold like a nipple
hole or something
each to their own I guess and all some
people might like that not for me not
for me we'll try it anyway said you
actually want to teach you a dress like
this just maybe one that doesn't show a
nipple preferably the ribs are kind of
in questionable places like that you
definitely look very careful with what
you worried with I like to shape it
I like so I ordered denim just to see
what it'd be like and these don't
actually look too bad the quite a weird
style like not a solid usually go for
but those are shorts and the very
extremely like high-waisted tight wasted
but I I want to I'm really interested to
see how they look because the lighter
denim style I'm not sure I don't really
know much about getting because I don't
usually wear it for the light kinda
80-85 and also I'm kind of constantly to
my ribs but they seem oh no no they're
pretty secure actually I'm going to be
access cure they want with for anything
right these are sure
now I don't know how these works to have
a look at the Vera but I know they feel
like very high but I definitely look
like sky little bit well it's really
well around the waist and we've got fits
really well but a sigh parts not a
chance for will I ever find shorts and
wait at the same time not really not
much beyond burial applicative if it was
my own fault not getting them in the
right side well like what you get
surprised Russell for me like on okay I
don't really buying this this is like
gold it looks to be I have no idea what
is it like no but like the length is
just a bit like concerning me I don't
know what you could do about that I mean
you're definitely alter it actually yeah
well yeah I like the color and
everything and it does look a lot more
expensive than it was it's also got a
split down the side so that that
actually might be extremely revealing
I don't know spec allowing something
like this I'm especially we see a split
leg like going right up to the hip and
it's tunic style as well so if the wind
picks up you know the only looks like a
minute and loved shots fires you do that
anyone else wants to film at all
yeah I've never been so confused or
repeated clothing in my entire life I
could have my Triple H size boobs and it
still wouldn't fit right I'll only come
closer
I could tie the color but I don't have
the bubbles currently attached to my
brother and like what is that like what
what do I do with that and then also
like problems with every and all this is
a bralette this is qi all this fit okay
I feel like that could actually be okay
actually big that at space time I really
like that I have to try it on popsicle
if you to quite promising because it's
quite like elastic so you can just
stretch it to put it where you want and
it's got like the grass style back and
got three alike lashes
I surely like that I think this is about
$2 to $3 as well so inexpensive so this
is like the bralette top thing and up
because I can not talk so I decided at
the back and that just made elephants
whiskey normal support here because it
is a whole connect I know I really like
it like I think it would go so many
things apparently I look very accessible
ready if you find size example to be not
so certain that I noticed is the gold
accents quite tacky looking like look at
that for example like you can see just
said does it look great
it's quite small that is one thing that
I will say the website was very
misleading because on the pictures this
looked to be a lot bigger it looks to be
quite like a big tool bag so I don't
just everything you see on the Internet
it is like a sprawl back with the eBay
videos and just seeing how misleading
the thumbnails were all of them to the
two-piece I got to two visas so if that
doesn't look good this one hopefully
world so this is more of a bralette
style it will just be quite big oh it's
a tie back and adjustable straps okay
this should fit and go with that we have
some high-waisted shorts here that
hopefully fit perfectly because they are
not elasticated and they have a single
zip on the back oh I'm a little bit
concerned for that but we'll see anyway
this example arouses in runway now state
to keep the high-waisted shorts and my
laptop and it fits so well my people
call the size guys on runway extremely
white accurate I guess also see if I was
signing for a while and it is cream had
also probably adjustable for that it's a
good thing because this gorgeous little
strap and then a ThighMaster outside
so yeah I'm really impressed with it so
I'm probably going to wear out tonight's
androids I Spy something so yes I'm very
first we've got the high-waisted shorts
and DUI hands properly if I'm trying to
get past the awkward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
