filming this video I sat down was like
you know what I feel like doing a full
face of makeup like eyelashes and
everything so I sat down did that makeup
and me being me then proceeded to have a
four hour nap and now here we are with
that same makeup on that's still
slightly destroyed all very destroyed
also just like saying one thinks I am
really really really excited so if you
want to my main town videos for a while
you'll know that my first ever merch
release job is coming very very very
soon within like less than a week but it
took so long as I kept sending back the
designs having new ideas but now the
designs same stone I'm so happy with it
here's a massive clue this is only one
part of the merch so there's another bit
to it too so if you do want to grab the
merch when its release which is gonna be
in a few days literally make sure you
follow me on my social medias cuz I'll
be announcing it there especially
Twitter Instagram snapchat well there's
only them through really okay on some
video now that ensures way too
long-winded eBay fake shoes fake
designer shoes I've been so interested
in this especially the easies so we're
gonna get straight into the video now
and start on boxing the shoes and lovely
guy oh these are Valentino's so this
brand didn't actually sell them a vapor
sorry as original Valentino's they've
just made a shoe look as close to
Valentino's as they could without
getting done for copyright they are not
bad they are not bad at all I just do
want to also say that I'm absolutely
obsessed with that color and the heels
not as metallic it's the rest of the
shoe but I really like the look of that
the soles like a deep black color as
well I really like these although I
already know that they would be so
comfortable to wear especially because
they're heels
let's see what you like on I can't tell
whether I'm actually hungry or whether I
thought about food so much that I'm
making myself believe that I'm hungry
and that just happened I was trying to
adjust and it just came off the entire
shoe let's pretend that one doesn't
exist let's try the other one so here's
the shoe and the bleeding why I keep
getting is such an opposition to show
you the shoe is because I am way too
lazy to refill this part separately and
that's probably the reason why I'm not
on a million subscribers yet subscribe
if you're not already we're getting
there yeah and the shoe ow
those sorts of brutal out there actually
pointy
don't ever get in a fight with a girl
wearing Valentino's because she will
take that bitch up and slap you across
the face with that and you'll be going
to hospital with some vehicles oh that
it's actually quite brutal I can't
remember what shoes I ordered here yes I
can they are so well made oh I just felt
them they are not well-made whatsoever
but they are so so realistic looking
okay I paid $8 fees right these are the
fake Balenciaga Oz I was so shocked when
I saw them the design of everything
about them is so realistic looking
however when you actually hold them in
your hand they are so lie the materials
just not good quality whatsoever which
you obviously expect the old concept of
this video is just to see how fake these
shoes are but in terms of fake shoes
these are not bad whatsoever they
definitely have paid attention to detail
though look at the sole on the real shoe
there's a lot of individual squares and
it's textured and then on the fake ones
there's also a lot of individual squares
but these ones just aren't textured I
don't know if you can see the difference
between them but that's actually really
good I know all the things they're
slightly different like the netting on
the front of the shoes or what more
sparse than the originals the lace is a
different colors and also the sides
don't come up this far and just don't
feel good quality whatsoever something
else' Oh something else oh do you want
to mention I'm really really sorry to
intervene but I do have a vlog tunnel if
you don't know about air but it's links
in the description and the reason I'm
telling you this is not just a random
self promo well it kind of is but let's
ignore that anyway and so by the time
you watch this video I will be in Paris
and I'm gonna be vlogging my Paris trip
so I'm literally going in two days so if
you do want to see what I get up to in
Paris just make sure you follow me on
that channel my vlog channel is a much
less PG version of my main channel
videos my main best friends are on
YouTube and I'm always with them
blogging with them on that channel it's
not PG whatsoever we roast each other
there's a lot of swearing there's a lot
of explicit content so if that's
something that interests you make sure
you go and subscribe right I've got the
fake Balenciaga shoe on and it is really
well and it seems to be comfortable so
yeah hates me modeling the shoe for you
right
it feels solid feels pretty good as far
as fake shoes go genuinely I am
impressed these are the Gucci's these
are the Gucci shoes as you can see so I
myself do not own a pair of Gucci's I
have not reached that level of youtuber
quite yet
however I've seen them on a lot of my
youtube friends so I can compare them
through like my head looking for Lewis
once did a live stream and all of our
numbers got leaked a lot of gossip
gossip Alex it's like three o'clock in
the morning in a hotel room so yeah just
been getting random calls ever since I
feel like these are very noticeably fake
I just think me I saw someone wearing
these I'd be like yep they're definitely
fake it's just a lot of things are very
slightly off which add up to make a fake
looking shoe like the front here is way
too rounded so one thing they have got
ride that I would have thought they
would just not have done if they've got
the red and green backs on the shoes
also another massive telltale sign where
I'd be like yep they are definitely fake
it's this side accent here and that
should be green and red with the B in
the middle if this a in the most Awkward
position ever but yeah and they're not
comfortable as well they are really hard
like on the floor I can literally feel
every little thing inside this shoe it's
not padded whatsoever also this one bit
here would crease so so fast cuz from
literally putting it on I can see
exactly the places where it's time to
crease so basically these shoes would
look absolutely battered after a few
wears oh I hate how well the package
this as you can see these are the
original Yeezy packaging looks real
legit so far you know I took my friend
Comi touched a light on YouTube owns a
pair of fake Newsies but they look so
real so I don't blame him I feel like it
is obvious that they're fake and I'm
pretty sure it because the sole here
comes up way too high but the style of
lace and the pattern is kind of legit
looking they've got that added a slog on
the inside though so the little branding
to mark thing on the side it's the exact
same as the originals maybe just a
slightly more vivid red that's so regal
look oh no it's not no it's not so on
the originals I'll insert a picture now
you can see that these stripes like the
zebra stripes are kind of structured and
this obvious stripes on it well this
here it looks like black and white specs
it's not really is Deborah stripe design
whatsoever back to this position these
are like they're are so comfortable and
they fit really well if these are just a
normal shoe I definitely wear them but
the fact that they are fake uses an
obviously fake Easy's my friends would
never speak to me again they are really
comfortable because they don't have like
a structured top it's literally just
like a material that cotton looking
material that's so comfortable yes
mother just unboxing some genuine
designer shoes what brand of a couch
that in fact how does it feel to be
uneducated and at least possible like
the ones you've got like them virtually
not bad are they no just feel a bit
plastic yeah they don't feel good
quality this one's really confused me
because these supposed to be shoes
because this comes from the cellar that
I bought the Louboutins from so yeah I
feel like it's gonna be a letter being
like lowly ghosts on the TV well if this
ain't a meme of ebay I'm pretty sure I
paid about 10 pounds for these can't
can't wait to wear them wow what was
what was a listing title I'm so confused
you know the news it's a really good
quality poster like it genuinely is I
want to display this in my room I have
memories of myself in my room very
narcissistic that was the first non
self-deprecating joke I've made in a
very long time note when he gone talk
and these the this is the final package
and these are another pair of fake uses
because I remember I ordered two so they
must be and I loved it when I received
my easy
male in dayz packaging these Yeezys are
so real-looking compared to these easy
so I bother all black ones
that's horrible that is actually
disgusting first of all the side of the
sole and the base is just straight down
the hallway oh my god I swear to God if
I end up on the easy buster now from
this video for wearing fake Easy's these
are shoes
honestly just no but yeah I've got a bed
full of fake shoes right now and I don't
really know what I'm gonna do with them
I actually I do I just put them in a I
think it's like women's charity bag and
it just goes to them the kiss obviously
they'll be people that will get a lot
more use out the clothes that I ever
will
so yeah just so you know I don't just
waste them and throw them away but
that's also not be being like and like
give them to charity I'm like kind of a
nice person you should like subscribe
it's just me sharing news I guess anyway
I'm done now yeah that's it for today's
video I do hope that you enjoyed if you
did give it a thumbs up and I will see
you in a future video and if there's any
video that you do want to see in the
future leave it as a comment but yeah
