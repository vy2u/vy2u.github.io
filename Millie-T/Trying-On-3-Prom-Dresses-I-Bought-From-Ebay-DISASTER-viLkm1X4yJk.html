finally finally do this video I'd be
waiting to it for so long I should have
done it last month but one of the
clothing items haven't arrived yet and
it still hasn't all we've got three
dresses here to try out that I Barney
VAE prom dresses for about two pounds
I'm just gonna slide this in there I
have started well channel I have about 6
months on there so far but I'm going to
London on Tuesday from the collaboration
I need to face with a company on certain
company so I will be vlogging that whole
day and if you want to see it then be
sure to subscribe to my vlog channel it
will be linked in the description or
they will be like an annotation of it
somewhere on screen I think if you using
the company's your wheels here please
what happened
I was only based just out of interest
looking at all their prom dresses not
with the intent to finally just out of
interest and I noticed little one of the
more extremely cheap and what made it
even more fishing was that these
pictures in the diagrams showed dresses
that you could just tell one two
thousand three thousand pound dresses
like high-end designer dresses so it
showed them dresses indicating now that
would suggest that they were selling but
it was like three pounds which is about
what four dollars
so obviously that side of the deal of a
lifetime or scam two of them here I've
never seen before they are still in
their packaging I have not been packaged
them I don't even know what tres it is
that hasn't arrived because it doesn't
say on packaging so three out of the
four that I always have come I do live
stream on you now most Fridays and I'm
one of them life dreams I promised that
I would unpack each one of the dresses
so I did and let me just tell you it's
not what the Pyramid shield first of all
it was extremely fitted by the image
they had Photoshop two pink onto the
dress so it's clear that any dress
wasn't the actual dress that was going
to arrive because they photoshopped to
call up onto the picture and it's a
really fine job as well by the way a
formatted this so on I am going to unbox
the dresses first of all and after that
for the end video I'll add in the video
over no actually try them all on
yeah have a look at this shall we I'll
be trying it on as well I haven't try it
on yet so we've got some really good
with you real life guy I don't have to
give to you to such bad quality
the lace isn't terrible it is yeah it's
quite terrible but it just goes down to
the pink color if you buy a dress like
this on eBay and the Pink's clearly
photoshopped on and you buy the dress
you deserve to have this sent to you
because I think anyone could have
realized that it was photoshopped the
color pink on to it okay now on a silky
almost silky material what distribute is
bad is just bad quality also you might
be thinking probably not but some of you
might be thinking actually as a picture
shoulder bow as well yeah you did know
it does come with a ball kind of come to
the earth bit of material that was a
little bit for boring on just
federally-owned packaging on the stream
however you now onto the second packet
by the way if you're enjoying this video
so far finding it interesting a little
bit then please press thumbs up button
and also subscribe if you want to see me
do more these kind videos where I buy
stuff off eBay this really bad it's a
mini dress oh my god look about what
dress that in it picture is show like a
$2,000 dress 2,000 pound jet you just
know it did
hello oh my god
some William so far oh my daddy's a mini
dress and a half look at that body look
good cougar my back Breville was a bit
of venturous Michael with wipe on the
edge with how short they buy their
dresses then a yeah recommend Islam to
be fair that this types of pretty
alright quality but the do a really bad
job with a stitching I don't know if you
can see that I'll probably get a close
to probably after but there's not really
cut the string down so it's going to
provide stitching job it's like you can
just warm is like four bits of stitching
they've just come out also what that
only just realized that is like me this
is the best dress that I was on about
but it's literally just mesh what would
you wear going to that usually if you go
braless you can see that if you
bro you would just be able to see that
straight through it dress of sequins
across the back I'm looking forward to
trying these on oh my god it's so
lightweight though it feels like 98 kind
of material
I'm really sorry some overexposed as
well the sun's just decided to make an
appearance but my camera settings wrong
settings and make it like the least
bright it can be quick shine no also
wait for the exposure to sort itself out
why's that and I bought some aviator
glasses spoon of the day yesterday
actually and I absolutely love them I
don't know how well they go to this
outfit a light retro and absolutely will
love it like the veil fashion glasses
not actually real which are very
pointless could actually wear glasses as
well
long distance ones but he despite the
outfit only package number three I
really wish I did have another package
it just didn't arrive I'm really hoping
this is a dress with like really long
wide bottom and a gold buckle belt
because it looks gorgeous on the picture
like drop-dead gorgeous and I just know
that's not what I'm going to get so I
really hope it's that woman not mesh one
nor with the mesh worn it won't be no
I'm sort of Nashua what the hell is that
Fila I think you can order a dress that
was remotely like that oh my god no it's
full speed up next one flamenco guys
listen to the dress so that was
drop-dead gorgeous and I really really
really wanted to come just to see what
your life but it's been actually life
and it was the most expensive one as
well I paid nine pounds last
you know honestly actually can look some
picture I would feel that this is the
actual dress in the picture but I don't
know why I ordered it because the one in
the pictures five enough as it is
I really don't want to put that on
because I've just realized like from the
back angle as well
oh god oh gosh luckily isn't it
smack from sorted what is that well as
well yeah so I let's get to try these on
now look first - I can deal with photos
where you get to the mesh one that I
gained a little bit and I do want to say
well if you don't have a lot money and
buying inexpensive dresses on eBay what
you like to do complete
go ahead from this video all I'm saying
is that don't always trust what you see
in the picture of like an eBay listing
because they can dry so yeah that's just
what I want you to take from this video
is so holy choice put it on I think I've
got it right actually oh my god
I literally just pulled it ever so
slightly in it I fell like five stitches
come out I don't know how easy is going
to be for me to show you them but look
at these shorts by the way it's not my
number line so pump what tink I have we
get to bid
hi there did you could put it off and
when it into a short one o fastest
crossing get out please I remember did
you even pictures yes the flower go yeah
I think it's the nicest dress I've ever
seen
oh cool crap you can borrow it if you
like I want fitment I think you would
but now this is a top fit as well
nice little er it's just it's actually
like screening my arms I do white white
lace let's actually go quality not
bought on eBay and by the way guys for
making merry I'm sorry I've got a
musician sauce and a little bit long a
little bit tied around the yard
all in all ten outta ten would recommend
the one shoulder thing doesn't really
work for me where the bit wriggles off
shoulder here it just goes all the way
down so it's not a very good fit at all
yeah I'm not really feeling it and I
have no idea what you would wear
underneath this something like a white
salt which kind of ruins the whole walk
conclude the features you can see
anything that you put on underneath and
it's also shoulder sort by - meat can't
you can have straps oh this is probably
a better viewer there again it down my
room I need to clean it and it's not a
gray dress or it's just this region here
just not working out and it also sheds
big tie right look about that is just
bits of the dress off so just took it
off what the hell the mesh dress that
I'm dreading is going on now as well I'm
gonna truth oh my god no no no again the
mask you look Jon Schull Syria come from
Internet Bulova limit I think the best
bet as well as it does the exact same as
your laptop wherever I can't even show
you this bit because it's just so mesh
mesh doesn't fit as if you go straight
through if you have a perfect figure and
I mean perfect nothing wrong with it
whatsoever
you could probably rock something like
this me on the other hand who likes food
a little bit too much probably not a
good idea that is everything from
today's video I have to end this video
with my vlogging camera as my main
camera died and Tom's already settled
first but why not and hopefully you
enjoyed it had a bit of a laugh at it
mmm one thing is probably taking this
video don't buy dresses from ebay like
if you are expecting a really really
nice dress because most of the time if
not probably not going to like that when
you get it in real life
oh it will be really cheap remake of
what you saw in the picture yeah anyways
that's it from me please subscribe to
our watching because hopefully that
means that you enjoy the video and maybe
want to see more I will do more of these
videos hopefully if you want to see them
I guess because I need to really enjoy
it yes have a beautiful day and live
like oh hi so good
fruit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
