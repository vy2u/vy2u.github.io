episode 3 on my eBay series thing that
I've got going on on this channel today
we're trying on wedding dresses and
don't plan on getting married anytime
soon this video was just being made out
of curiosity these dresses were
ridiculously little like three dollars
so obviously I'm not expecting amazing
quality for me Jeff it's Apple you know
you get what you pay for but I am
curious as to what will actually arrive
because only like image on eBay that
showed you suggest you're ordering like
this thumbnail you just know that them
dresses cost a lot more than three
dollars so what you actually receive
isn't what's shown in the image so they
kind of forged the dress but use really
really bad material so I was just
curious to see what I would actually
receive and we will find out and really
quickly I have an Instagram page I'm
going to start posting on a lot more now
I'm going to get like a scene going like
continue with this video I've got so if
you do ever want to follow me on
instagram or hit me up on Instagram is
my profile okay so package that's what
it's like you like the plain package oh
wow oh that smells really nice like you
thought perfume did you smell some
really fresh linen I know which one is
supposed to be by the way some of these
dresses are kind of bridesmaid dresses
and are all like pure wedding dresses
because a lot of them were quite
expensive on eBay and I wanted to stick
to like $3 realm but all like white lace
dresses up most of them or maybe even
all of them can pass as wedding dresses
to be fair that's actually quite a good
March like it's pretty much exact I'm
actually quite impressed with that one
because it looks exactly like obviously
we'll find out when I actually put it on
whether it's why it looks like in the
image I don't know how it will look on
me because I'm not really a slimmer
three girl in the image kind of like
sandpapery but not I can't make it goes
through you and I thought yeah this
isn't bad at all for three dollars it's
not bad at all however I really don't
like the way it fits on my body
it doesn't compliment anything it just
looks like a bit of materials being
thrown over my body it's not tie in any
places it's just
basically loose everywhere so it's just
not fitted overall I'd rate it probably
like in terms of factoring in the price
I'd rate it probably like four five out
of ten on the dislike three dollars
though by the way if you watch this
video I'm enjoying it will be absolutely
amazing if you could hit that subscribe
button down below we've just hit half a
million that is absolutely unreal and
it's going to be more of these to come
there is some supplant for each to do
with eBay's if you want to watch those
videos just subscribe put it also the
black pronounced the only package that
is black go beautiful wife oh I know it
Thomas's this one wasn't shown on a
model so I don't know how it actually
supposed to walk is shown on like a
mannequin and I know of the dresses on
the mannequin is a very expensive dress
I just want to really get at least
occupy windows let me get a dress like
that you know my plastic bag except when
you pick credos to the mugger oh god no
I don't like the sequins on that one
what them oh my god you know when you
buy a dress and you've got the corpse
and it's got the padding you'll have to
wear a bra with it maybe cyclist or
whatever this is what you get when you
pay three dollars for a dress as it
cooks
imagine this guys watching this like the
hell is she on about Lisa where the
boobies go by the way guys comment
bizzle any new videos if you want to
seem to do with eBay or anything like
that any video requests I read every
single comment honestly I read them all
all the judges are my prom dress ones
were like really bad in my opinion or
these aren't too bad so far anyway I
don't want the feeling of that and I
feel like it well this mesh thing here
it's a bit random like it's just fit
it's just a bit that looks like mosquito
netting yeah I could just put that on my
window and catch like a million flies
overnight if you are wondering why the
word disaster is in the title that's
because of this dress what is this dress
I hate it so much
it's just that random bit of mesh
material like the mini skirt it just it
does not do any justice to anyone's
figure it's just not a good look
whatsoever and everyone was watching me
wearing this dress as well it was a damn
virus
before you get your hopes up this dress
definitely wasn't $3 it's actually from
a website called New York dress and will
be linked in the description they
contacted me and asked if I would be
interested in working with them and I
accepted because I felt like it would be
of good use to this video like when you
look at this dress and compared to the
$3 ones you really get an idea of how
bad quality those eBay dresses are which
obviously is expected because of their
price but I am in love with this dress
and you can trust I am being honest
because you will see me wearing it as my
prom dress in a few months time if you
are on the hunt for a really nice prom
dress I highly highly recommend that
website I offer so many different
designer brands and they are 100% would
you I checked multiple times oh wow
I was actually really good oh that's the
one it's supposed to be okay so this is
like a mini dress with their like a
transparent and material going down as
well it's like a mini dress but a
full-length dress in one but I'm looking
at this top bit and it actually feels
like really good quality material at you
genuine white video so positive compares
my ebay prom dress 1 I have no idea just
going off the lace like the lace it's
relatively thick but like stitching
there as well and then going down it's
got the mesh and the mesh utilizes best
quality ever but it's not bad I'm just
so excited to try this one on overall
I'm pretty sure the dress that you
received is the dress that's shown in
the picture because it's just so
accurate own thing I don't like is the
top because I feel like it goes a little
bit wide on the front like I had to
adjust it so much to get it to not
expose anything else I do like the fit
of it as well it's relatively
complementing but also not at the same
time in some areas it is another snob
so this one isn't too bad either
there's not really much to say about
this elite itself if physical qualities
the dress that I was holding before but
it's like not terrible way this is all
pointing to like back to the actual
price that it costs as well like the
role $3 Oh feel like this might be a bit
uncomfortable to the material is a bit
sandpaper Eli can you hear this I don't
feel I can give a solid opinion until
I've actually tried them on so so this
one definitely isn't really that much of
a wedding dress I really like the top
but I'll be like how like the idea of it
it just isn't made out the best material
obviously because you get what you pay
for but I don't know this one's kind of
a tricky one I wasn't keen on the
sleeves and it was quite high on the top
area you can tell probably sure to throw
that on to ruin extra again this one is
high neck cutoff on the chest area goes
down to trying to use a plain opaque
white material and the lake itself isn't
too bad but it's also not great even my
entry is like my grandma when she shows
on this that really makes no sense
because no knee you know my grandma but
if you didn't know my grandma this is
the kind of like sewing and lifting that
she does it the lace I will give that
one a go anyway here it is looking at it
this one is definitely more of like a
bridesmaid dress but I just really
wasn't keen on the material it wasn't
fitted whatsoever wasn't complimenting
and also the material would just crease
really easily and would just stress me
out so I'd rate about a two-hours 10
let me have a thing for this video I
hope that you enjoyed it if you did
leave a thumbs up leave a comment I
absolutely will read in your comments
and I will see you in my next video have
a beautiful day and live life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
