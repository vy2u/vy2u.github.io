video is quite exciting it's a bit of a
throwback video not even a throwback I
just haven't done an eBay video in
absolutely ages because I haven't had a
reason to
however since Halloween's coming up in a
few weeks I thought was a perfect
opportunity just gone by some cheap-ass
Halloween costumes and tried them out
ever since I did like the first ever
eBay video which was the trying of a
prom dresses on eBay for like under $3
and that like bull world mean eBay have
become a meme like with my friends and
even you guys as well always being like
oh it's the eBay Queen and stuff like as
a joke and I just find it so funny like
I feel way to actually be filming an
eBay video seriously now I know it's so
hard to explain but yeah enjoy the video
also I do just want to mention that I
have merged coming out extremely soon
it's the designs being completed it's
just getting them produced and stuff now
so it's gonna be out so so soon and if
you do want to see that make sure you
are following me on my social media
especially Twitter so that you'll be
notified as soon as it comes out if you
do want to grab them anyway and also my
vlog channel as well because I'll be
announcing on there like doing a proper
video okay I'm gonna start with this one
because it's a really weird texture it
feels like quite bumpy and slightly
flexible base so weird oh what the hell
okay so this is a Mario costume as you
can see here it's really weirdly packed
can you see how he like keeps the shape
it's like vacuum packed oh it feels it
feels okay actually oh my god it comes
with a moustache as well and gloves oh
and a tutu I was expecting to only get
like the main outfit and all the others
were like not included kind of thing but
they're all included starts pretty cool
oh there we go okay there's the Mario
costume and a hat as well this is the
Hat
what the hell this is such great value
for money
that's a Mario ha I love it I think he's
so cute
Mario I hate dressing is like he can't
stop a Halloween like I actually want to
be a character and I was gonna be sure
from clueless
since I get so many comments saying that
I look like her
but I don't know my hand is an absolute
mess today by the way guys please don't
judge it too hard this video was quite
spontaneous because I was gonna film it
tomorrow what rexy's oh okay
well I know what that is it's come with
a proper like g-string thong as well and
I'm not too sure why like I understand
they might want it to like hide the
nickel-iron and stuff but it's like a
dress so you wouldn't see that anyway I
don't think but I mean that's a cute
little freebie I guess
okay so I've just put on the Mario
outfit and I really don't mind it at all
the only thing is that I did get in the
wrong size slightly too big as you can
see like this is coming off and then the
skirts not very tight on the waist it's
a little bit loose fitting the necklace
is okay but when it's full-length it
goes past this blue bit and looks a
little bit weird and odd I'd rather you
just sit there but you can just DIY that
and adjust it yourself easily oh I also
have to put on the accessories as well
because I forgot about that
and so we've got the gloves and the hats
as well you saw it before but you didn't
see it with the full outfit that's the
high I actually love this outfit so much
it's so cute
and like with the socks as well and if
you put it with a pair of heels as well
you can dress it up a little bit it's
not necessarily to unflattering it could
just do with being a little bit on the
small side but I love this this is
amazing okay next thing is in a very
small worryingly small package because I
know that there should be a full outfit
in this I'm pretty sure oh no I think
these might be the socks actually yeah
knee-high white socks the reason I
ordered these is because I ordered so
many Halloween like short dresses and I
thought like they would all go with like
knee-high white socks as well so yeah
that's a little extra so I'll just throw
in with every outfit I guess this next
one is a bigger package let's open this
bad boy up and see what we got
oh this is the Alice in Wonderland
costume this is actually really cute I
think it looked online anyway I haven't
unpackage it yet that could change oh
and he's got like a picture of a teacup
on it and it's so obviously they've
printed it from the internet and stuck
it on the worst thing is they
printed a really bad quality tikal so he
just looks awful like it looks s plus
Ian just bad quality this looks like
cartoon like I dig it you can see that
it's like a full-on Alice in Wonderland
costume this is really cute and these
rules so inexpensive as well if you have
blonde hair I think Alice is such a good
character to go ass I mean even if you
don't have blond hair I mean you can be
a ginger Alice or a brown haired Alice
if you want to or a gray pet Alice if
your grandma it came with a headphones
that actually is so comfortable as well
I rate that of all the outfits this want
to seem to be the best quality so we'll
see oh my god I've literally just walked
back to my room and I've never been in
so much agony waving one outfit it's
this material it's got like a really
scratchy material and it's all on the
back as well if you can see all the
materials so frustrating I came in with
Stan material quite well to like it
doesn't really bother me much but this
material is just like scratching it
everywhere
oh this next one is one that I kinda
came up with by myself and I don't know
if it's an actual thing or not so I'm I
not even being the first person to come
up with it but I was thinking if you
wanna have a Halloween costume and still
want to look good but don't wanna like
overuse the cat outfit and stuff then
basically you're like perfect what if
you went as a dark Victoria's Secret
Angel so like black wings instead of
white and you could stop your own outfit
together like shorts and like a crop top
with like side high boots or something
like that and just you can really just
DIY the outfit make it look however you
want it to look the wings are cute as
well because they Bend however you want
them to and they don't move oh I don't
think I was supposed to do that and the
wings are on now they're really
comfortable as well you can literally do
what you want with this and that's the
very simple one this is the dark
Victoria's Secret Angel
I just paired it with this strapless
dress you don't have to wear a dress you
could literally wear shorts on a crop
top I just thought the dress was easier
to show you and it's quite modest for
the camera as well but if I turn around
there the wings you can
literally spell them how you want
absolutely love them it's like a dog
Victoria's Secret Angel and then you
could curl you have you do your makeup
as well I just think the wings obviously
finish the outfit off because they make
it what it is this next outfit is
another light little DIY one that I put
together it's a red hooded cape so I'm
pretty sure you could probably guess
where this is going basically Little Red
Riding Hood and with this I have a white
strapless dress that I can wear with the
Cape I think this is about four pounds
as well so it's actually four pounds for
a Halloween costume the quality feels
pretty decent on this as well and yeah
you've got the Cape and then you've got
the hood here and I'm not gonna give it
full on with you now until I've actually
tried it on because I legit just need to
try this on we have a review and
put it together with the white dress
that I'd wear as well but yeah this is
another idea for a Halloween outfit I
think Little Red Riding Hood it'd be
quite cute especially if you have like a
little woven basket you can use as a
handbag and that non-stop so this is the
first part to the next DIY Little Red
Riding Hood outfit so this is a white
strapless dress that I already own and
then you just pair it with this and
hopefully it will give the effect of
Little Red Riding Hood okay so now I'm
pretty sure all you have to do is just
tie it around the neck here and you've
got yourself your Little Red Riding Hood
outfit with the Cape and everything and
I think the dress is slightly longer
than the Cape which probably doesn't
look very good is it
oh no they literally like exactly the
same length how good is that and then
you've also got the hood which I've just
put up now but what's really comfortable
as well and doesn't feel like it's gonna
come down this next one is this is a
nurse outfit obviously a Halloween style
one which means it has blood all over
the outfit faithful hope you never know
with eBay what the hell it is supposed
to be a crown or some
I don't think I've ever seen a nurse
wear a crown what nurse wears a crown
looking thing like this isn't a thing
right is it am I being dumb or I mean
this is this is like one of the surgical
masks they're like protect them from
disease Wow I actually really rate this
outfit because you can't even see my
face you don't have to worry about
looking ugly on the night or even do
your makeup do your eyebrows but if
shadow stick on some false lashes and
you're good to go for the night and if
you do find yourself to be ill and
sneezing you don't have to worry about
your disease being contagious because it
all just collects in this nice mask and
doesn't spread on to anyone else socks
yeah I'm still glad I bought white socks
socks these have blood on them so my
doing the effective and Mario outfit you
know what I mean and the outfit is here
it doesn't look to be fitted at all it's
like a slinky dress and with a sip down
the middle is very modest I think I'm
just a bit concerned about the bottom I
think they've attempted to make it look
ragged at the bottom yeah that's
everything for that outfit anyway I'm
excited to try that one on I think oh I
love it when it gets tucked my piercings
Wow more please watch the game Loki you
know what the hey get off okay this is
weird
aesthetically I think it looks pretty
cool like it looks decent but the fit of
this dress is so weird but they've made
it tight-fitting but not body con so
because my waist is like five times
smaller than my thighs it's like
clinging to my thighs but then when it
comes to my waist it's like a sling
dresses like so much room and it's weird
I don't know it's such a weird fear I've
never won anything so weird fitting
before oh okay this is the basic bitch
costume at the mall this is a super
woman outfit because obviously
superwoman is going to be what everyone
dresses up this year I'm pretty sure
anyway that actually doesn't feel too
bad wow the quality's not bad on that so
it's a strapless a Wonder Woman dress
with a Wonder Woman logo there looking a
little bit weird I'm not really sure
about that logo there but it's like a
velvety top and doesn't feel like the
best velvet but you can't expect it to
for the price that I paid for it which
was again like something under ten
pounds and then it goes on to I don't
even know what material this is is such
a weird material I've never actually
felt anything like this before it legit
kind of feels like a balloon I'm not too
sure it came with an extra as well oh
wow I love it when it fits
hmm I'm not really sure how to feel
about that with the sizing slightly
small if my eyelash is a little like the
falling off it's because they are I'm
really bad at applying false eyelashes
it's still a little bit loose for that
I'm pretty sure it is a headband I just
think I have a flat head
oh no way come to the Cape as well yeah
it does
I love that this is such a successful
video I love this but that also means I
can't put fail in the title and
clickbait it I probably still will
anyway so I've just put on the Wonder
Woman outfit and the like this bit here
it should definitely sit a little bit
higher rope so I'm thinking if I put on
a really padded bra maybe I'll like
bring it out a bit and bring this a
little bit up I'm gonna go try it
okay so I've just put on the bra now and
it's ever so slightly better I mean it
still doesn't fit perfectly it's again
slightly on the loose side but I did
size down in everything so I don't
understand why the things come so loose
it must just have been like a bad size
guide I mean it's better than it came
bigger rather than small looks and I can
actually give into it but this is quite
cool you've got the headband here we
know how that went when I tried this on
yesterday so um oh my god
it's literally changing the shape of my
eyebrows as well because it's just
squashing my head and you also have the
Cape here I love this right okay finally
got the Cape on and it fits weird but I
can't tell whether I like you or not I
think I do like the way it fits cuz he
literally just perfectly sits on the
edge of my arm and like won't fall back
I don't think cuz he's like it just fits
perfectly I like rate that a lot Wow
last one now don't know why I think did
I get some on light oh okay zombie snow
white oh the first extra that comes with
the snow I out there is of course her
famous red headband oh I wish I had
something like this when I was younger I
would've actually worn it to death this
is so cute I feel like Minnie Mouse oh
wait no it's not why I should have got a
Minnie Mouse out
by the way guys if you are enjoying the
video and you haven't subscribed yet
please don't be shy press the subscribe
button below
oh I think she's strapless as well oh
yeah that's quite nice actually I like
that that's so snow-white looking as
well but bearing in mind the cheap price
it still looks legit oh I feel like I
would have rather got an actual snow
white outfit rather than the zombified
version because I feel like originally
this was just a snow white outfit and
then they went and attempts to do DIY
and messed it all up
kind of like me when I thought I could
do DIY videos on YouTube okay so this is
the Snow White costume and I actually
liked it a lot and I just do wish that
it wasn't sold on be fine cuz I feel
like it makes you look a little bit
tacky well I mean it fits perfectly
again slightly on the loose side it
could do with being like a little bit
tighter but really not that much of an
issue at all I'm still in love with the
headband I feel like a child and I love
it and I just really rate this outfit a
lot I really do like it definitely a
good option if you want to get into the
Halloween spirit if you want to see more
of me at all I don't know why you would
but if you do I have a vlogging channel
which I will have linked in the
description below I upload basically
every day on to that channel or I have
been doing recently and if you want to
get to know me a hundred percent more
ebay videos to come in the future
I'll get planning them now and other
videos as well I've have so many videos
in the works so yeah get ready for them
and I will see you in my next video bye
