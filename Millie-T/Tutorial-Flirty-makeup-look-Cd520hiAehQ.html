means is close to Valentine's Day
obviously I'm going to be doing a makeup
tutorial now this video is the
collaboration with yang Yang if she do
want to check out her channel then it's
in the description below and the link so
click on that and then you will see her
video on the outfit so I'll basically
have the whole look
so what this is a flirty look let's get
going first I play feel-good fact set by
soap &amp;amp; Glory which is a BB cream and I
just play that to the back of my hand
and then use my fingers to cut that all
around my face and blend in with my
fingers it's just basically a
translation between that kind of primes
and brightens up your face
beauty balm next I use the elf sponge
brush and I use that to apply my Mac
slick cover up all over my face I dot
that under my eyes get rid of my really
dark bags that I hate I always get
really dark bags under my eyes and just
any blemishes and also side of my nose
because my nose tends to get quite red
and then I blend it with my fingers in
the sponge next I apply my foundation
and I used to Barbara Daley brush and
Rimmel match perfection foundation and
I'll just apply that all over my face
using the foundation brush and my
fingers as well because I think fingers
are the best to blend the foundation
personally the extra coverage I use the
Mac selects sheer press powder and I use
the applicator sponge that came with it
and to just apply it all over my face it
is a bit darker than my skin shade but
it's not noticeable different and I also
have to do my eyebrows and to do that I
use instant brow pencil by benefit now
personally I think that the product uses
up a bit quickly but as a product on the
whole it's really good after that is
time to move onto my lips and I first
use a Nivea lip balm suppose you kind of
base in protection for my lips and then
I move on to the L'Oreal glam shine
which is basically like a lip crayon and
they plied that all over my lips because
it's a really lovely red color
it's called daddy dragon fruit next I
used a big fatty mascara by Urban Decay
which I love is my favorite mascara
Ohayou ma I love it and I just applied
that to both sides of my eyelashes and I
also used a rolling technique
is a alternative to a eyelash curler
because I always feel like they're just
gonna rip my eyelashes out and the very
few times we've used them that is
exactly what they do and I do not know
what I happen to the lighting in this
little clip here sorry about that but
this is what my eyelashes look like
after that next I used my Rimmel
scandaleyes eyeliner and I do very small
flicks as I hate statement eyeliner
moving onto my eyelids I am going to use
a Naked 2 palette yeah I I love you so
much and I'm going to use the brush that
it comes with and for a base I'm going
to use foxy which is this front of the
palette and I just apply that all over
my lid above my crease and under as well
then I use the kind of Flatbush and I
apply Verve all over my eyelids more or
less cuz it just gives it that extra bit
of shimmer that really works well with
all the other eye line I shadow that
goes on after that that is what the look
looks like so far
I used chopper and I apply that to the
center of my eyelid because I just feel
like it goes really well with the flirty
Valentine's Day look and I also a mixed
together ydk I'm chopper to create a
lovely toned down brown color and I do
it on the other side as well patting it
to decrease fallout and I bring it up to
my crease now to blown it off together I
use the opposite end of the brush which
is kind of the blending brush and I use
a Johnson's baby right to stop fallout
to get rid of it and go back to the eye
lashes and I use the Urban Decay big
fatty mascara and I play one more coat
this is a finished eyelook of at the end
it's very toned down not stamen but you
add a little heart I did I also applied
the Jia Danny bronzing pearls to my
cheeks all over first of all and then I
make you fishy face and contour my
cheeks with it
so this is my finished flirty
Valentine's Day look now if you want to
know what I did to my hair to make it
kind of loose waves and it is Victoria's
Secret inspired if you would want me to
