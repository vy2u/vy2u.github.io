oh man I'm about to go to the gym I
don't wear red leggings on a daily basis
today's video is going to be the Oakley
location photo shoot challenge because
where I live it's a nice area I like it
however go five minutes that way and go
five minutes that way and you find some
questionable places so I really don't
think we gonna have that much trouble
finding Oakland locations this video
which is perfect I'm gonna ask one of
the people that I lived with Spencer to
film this video with me because he's
really good with photography and he's
like kind of game into it a little bit
something I realized with this channel
he said I don't like doing videos I've
already being done before I really like
original video ideas like when I wear
heels for 24 hours when I started like
the eBay prom dress thing and like the
cheap clothes testing wish and stuff it
hadn't been done before at the time I
felt a little bit bad like following a
trend for this video so I thought I put
my own twist on it and make it extra AF
I'm just basically gonna be a diva for
this video but I'm ready for it and I'm
excited
thanks joy come on flex your new shoes
Ben yeah sure I still winter like this
yeah it makes you look Thomas lighting
right the wool behind is the what is
what you can get in the world I was a
little bit more Caucasian I blend in
yeah so but you know the challenge
unless see how it goes I'm kind of
relying on Spencer so what Sophie does a
good job you've already put in the video
yeah I know you're a fake
you do but yeah I have a confession I've
already filmed the video and I'm doing
this angel afterwards so it went really
well look at a watch yeah if you wanna
watch a fake use you must subscribe
they're gonna okay so we're about to
leave now it's like half-past five so
you might just about catch the sunset
and maybe get some cool pictures from
that I killed my hair the curls will
drop out within 20 minutes but it's okay
I've got these very extra pink
sunglasses that appear to still have the
label on them so I should probably take
that off and I'm also wearing a black
top that I've cropped along with black
leggings and then my white and black
beauty's for a little bit of contrast in
there
at first I occasionally
it was just a wall and it was covered in
like really ugly trees and branches and
vines and we thought this is very ugly
so he's perfect for this video so that's
where anyway it's a mean Spencer were
just walking to the location I mean it's
back to both said how ugly these bushes
were five bricks missing up there as
well it's not the best location but
we're gonna take a few pictures and see
if we can fix it for the insta first
attempt and it didn't fail it did not go
downhill so I'm feeling pretty positive
and this is how the pictures turned out
of all locations this location was the
most boring but with the light a little
bit at the tree now it looks pretty cool
then we were literally walking for like
five more seconds and we saw a orange
bike on the side of the road
very interesting location so we're not
at the nicest houses in the world right
now or like apartment it's however
hopefully no one's windows open but
there's a bike here and it's bright
orange and you know what I think it
looks pretty cool and it you look so
perfect if you just by itself surrounded
by not the best grass not the cleanest
floor so again that was perfect for the
challenge of ever thought I'd take a
picture on the bike this is a bike I've
gone for the denim jacket 51 as well and
how's the light exactly feel this
actually yet really yep good good good
yeah now you're famous okay my fake town
is so patchy like it always happens when
I fake tan and then wear trainers but
I've switched to heels because I think
heels with that bike might be kind of
edgy this is my Instagram along with
some that you won't seen in this video
so if you want to see that have a sneak
peek assume more like behind the scenes
footage definitely wanna follow me on my
Instagram there's a lot of images for
this shoe on that because they were just
they look so professional and so cool
then we saw the literal best ugly
location we could probably find it was
an overflowing massive skip and it was a
trolley then - despite something over
there which is by far the ugliest a
possible location we'll make yo will try
I think we could do you think yes
we'll try I'm gonna get in that trolley
and look behind it as well very nice
very nice right one of the reasons I
wanted to do these challenges because I
thought a picture in a trolley would
look so cool I knew this was going to be
a very extra video
so even naturally feet up glasses on
survived know that again now we saw a
little like an abandoned basketball calm
and like okay perfect that'll do it we
just spotted this beauty on the side of
the road it's an empty basketball court
yeah I think he's pretty much an
abandoned basketball court and I was
saying Spencer how sick it would be if I
could like sit in there however it's
just not possible like I can pull myself
up that high cuz I'm not six foot five
maybe we could get if I go behind here
do you think let's try it so we went in
there and we saw some fencing that I
could get behind so we took some
pictures I had no idea how they turn out
they turned out better than I expected
but not amazing pictures for the
basketball court okay then our main
thing but I don't know would have to
call a success or a fail I call this to
my leg in the middle she just kind of
sit on the fence just swing around it
was an experimental one we then walking
down an alley and everyone knows alleys
aren't the most aesthetically pleasing
places and locations so Spencer just
took some pictures of me in front of the
railings the background behind the
railing wasn't the most pretty as well
yeah he's that son of much possible and
we just rose up places our next photo
locations one of the jackets I was
wearing was red yellow and black and we
passed like a Royal Mail post
distribution center and if you don't
live in the UK royal ale is probably
like the biggest supplier of males and
their colors that main colors are red
yellow so this Royal Mail area was
absolutely perfect but only problem was
we can actually get in there so it
wasn't accessible to the public so we
had to sneak in pretty sure the gate
should be sure but they're not and this
guy coming in there so you got the Royal
Mail vehicles only I'm trying to act
casual in case you get told off because
we're not supposed to be here these
gates are open for some reason but we're
just going to go in and snap a few
pictures and hopefully we don't get
Couture off
you take picture forbidden
these are pictures from the Royal Mail
area I absolutely love them like the
color cold how well they go together
I literally what obsessed with them I
love it what are the place I wanted to
find with some like steel ugly
construction looking stairs and we saw
this Factory in there like never steel
stairs going down the side of the
building so I was like you know well
this will be a perfect place to take a
picture let's just give it a go I'll
have some sat down sure see what they
look like two minutes later and we've
approached our next location I think
we're gonna shoe on them steps just to
see what they look like
some metal ugly scaffolding steps maybe
we can get a good picture out of them
they're not exactly new steps either and
they've got oh my god yep can't wait to
sit in bed Wow love my life
yeah my legs after taking the photos
there this is what they look like I
really like these one Spencer's really
creative for then dick loads of
different kind of shots and they ended
up looking really really cool and then
it was the golden hour wow this is
amazing so we're outside Tesco's and it
was literally golden hour everything was
bright orange because the Sun was
setting this is the Golden Hour ladies
and gentlemen ooh
sound like not me then I don't know what
I found alight but it wasn't me and I
saw some empty trolley sheds okay so we
found two empty shopping trolley shed
things they are very ugly I don't think
the windows have been cleaned in oh good
ever
also while studying the testicles I've
just spotted these bubbles these will be
so good for pictures as well like just
if you catch it at the right moment I
think these are look okay so I'm gonna
buy them and hopefully we get to use
them in a picture and it turns out okay
so we took pictures that and they turned
out so cool because Spencer took some
shots through the window and because the
window was really cloudy - it'd never
been cleaned it made the shots look like
really soft and then with the gold Sun
here me as well it makes a really
different and interesting image compared
to the other ones there were the
locations we did obviously this
challenge was so fun I really really did
enjoy yeah it was just something
different and I wanted to try out put a
like a tiny little twist on it hopefully
you enjoyed if you did give it a thumbs
up leave a comment and I'll see you in
another video whenever that might
because I don't have an upload a
schedule for this channel which I
probably should have good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
