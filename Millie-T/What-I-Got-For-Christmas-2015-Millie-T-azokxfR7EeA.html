today's video which is going to be a
Christmas haul I would do the typical
disclaimer but I'm pretty sure you'll
already know what it is by now so if you
just want to kind of read jog your
memory on the disclaimer I'll put in the
description below I've got a rather
large family so I've got quite a bit to
go through but I'm so so grateful for
everything I've got the things that are
in here some of the things I did not
expect and just to let you know I just
want to say I'm not writing at all this
video has been requested and that is the
truth I promise you other than that
we've got to go
leave a comment and please make sure to
subscribe if you enjoy this video so the
first thing that I got I was not
expecting it was off my stepdad and it
was a infact minute 8 camera in white
what I had been wanting for a 1 while
and he knew this and you remember Danny
got a terrific Christmas so
over-the-moon I also got a watch off my
auntie and a huge trend right now of big
watches and I really like the big
watches however in my opinion I prefer
small dainty watches because I find them
more feminine Memphis is just my opinion
it might not be the same for you of
course the fact that it is small and why
and the leather I I really love it then
I got this benefit set it comes with a
full size they're real mascara full-size
push-up liner and then a mini I makeup
remover and I need an eye makeup remover
because makeup wipes just ain't doing it
for me I also got a Rimmel concealer and
I really need to do conceal a lot and
wanted a new concealer or needed so you
don't want to see me without concealer
because my Mac one malfunctions a lot
because I like going to get some out and
it'll just go everywhere so definitely
you need but very grateful I also got a
red clutch from my cousin is absolutely
gorgeous and it will definitely go with
a nice black dress skincare simple under
the one of my favorites with some makeup
brushes from urban decay of The Naked 3
collection or the naked collection are
you opened a nice steady beauty for
about half an hour I've been wanting new
makeup bushes for an extremely long time
so the fact that I ended up with these
for Christmas my dream my dreams came
true
and eyeliner but before I use this I
should probably learn how to do winged
eyeliner I cannot do it to save my life
at all that's why you never seen the
Annihilator ru L'Oreal hair kit it
includes two hair products and a
telescopic mascara which I've used
before and it's telescopic and a step
from Jack Wills off my ante comes with
three body sprays I really have this one
and I really like it I know the smell of
this one and I like it I don't swallow
that one so that'll be a nice surprise a
nice little Christmas hat for the winter
time Maybelline the blushed nude palette
and the colors in here are absolutely
gorgeous
I'm nude very nice DKNY delicious
skin perfume I've never tried this one
before but I had a quick smell I fell in
love Maybelline mascara I was running
out of mascara as well like concealer
mascara and concealer I tend to use all
very fast I didn't even know you could
get these but is it a pack of two mini
DKNY perfumes and I have three now and I
have got a Apple one like the original
one and then a B delicious fresh blossom
one looks like a pink one I am señal
them both and they're absolutely
gorgeous this one I've had before but I
used up in the matter of about two
months because I was still in love I'm
in love with a lot of things in this
video I also got a white nail polish
with my grandma which I really like
because it makes my skin looked and who
doesn't like to looked and I also got a
nude fa which is a nude color so I can
wear nail polish and get away with it at
school because I'm enrolled man and will
rebel and then just a hot pink color
which I really like as well I don't tend
to buy too many nail polishes so they
will definitely start off your
collection oh and Instax film to go with
the Instax camera so I've got 20 sheets
so like 20 pictures all together in this
pack which is a really really good
accessory for it and of course if you're
watching this video the chances are you
probably got a onesie for Christmas
because they are ideal so I got a onesie
and it's a do wrap one say even better
so it looks like this I can't really
show you the whole thing but it's like
gorgeous like a giraffe print
it's all soft I don't have anyone since
I've had once in the past but the other
get holes in the area where you don't
want to get holes in a onesie oh it just
gets too small for me and this one will
hopefully last me a while so soft I also
got some pajamas and I'm wearing them
right now
I swear on Christmas Day I change into
my pajamas at about 3 o'clock friends
off Emma I've got three sets of like
foot of body lotion so I got body butter
cream body moisturizer and again the
body butter creamer I hadn't opened
these but I will be using these very
very soon off a whole curse there I got
this revolution makeup palette it's a
blush palette so it comes with a lot of
shimmery shade it comes with like
bronzing powder which I will be using
for some contour hand warmer perfect for
school when it gets to winter it's
already winter but when I got back in
January you know what I mean bloody
sucks if you live in the UK and you go
to Primark you'll probably have a pair
of fluffy socks because they're they're
just fluffy socks that's all that needs
to be said off a friend kay I got this
gorgeous red lipstick from Rimmel and
she was like oh oh you don't like red
she was like yeah except Kate on it so I
thought - forget it I was like oh yeah
oh that's off Kirstie's well I got this
Rimmel Sun bro desire nail polish and
she got me this because she knew I have
an obsession with nail polish currently
as I said before along with the essay I
could have a whole obsession with nail
polish also of course they I got a a
lovely winter mug it's like a mod with a
little blanket around it but I haven't
got that to show enough Emma I also got
my angel bath bomb okay also got me this
silky smooth body lotion whenever I hear
silky smooth I always think azole Hanks
is like a mixie hair silky smooth now
okay just me that is everything I have
today I am so so sorry that this video

it half an hour long and okay I'm gonna
