the 25th of December which means it's
Christmas Day so maybe Christmas first
of all and that also means I'm being
really organized by filming this video
by filming it on time though I probably
I'm gonna end up uploading this on like
the 20th of January I tried okay today's
video is a what I got for Christmas
video hopefully you enjoy and if you do
subscribe so I thought now would be a
good time to put my merch because if
you've got any Christmas money that you
don't know what to do with me like you
know what maybe I kinda want some
Willett emerg head to the description
and grab your merch I do this merch
design in hoodies and t-shirts and also
pop sockets this style has rose gold
writing on the back or you can pick up a
white and metallic silver jumper which
is really really cool take a look if
you're bored and one of brows whilst
listening to this video first thing I
want to show is this Yankee Candle I got
this off my dad I've never actually
owned a Yankee Candle when I thought I
was YouTube beauty guru in like 2012 I
had about 12,000 candles in my room you
can watch my night routine videos if you
want proof of that I literally had like
50 but out of all those candles I never
actually owned a Yankee Candle but this
one is candy cane flavored and it is so
nice smelling it's really minty I don't
know what it smelled like whilst it was
burning though so I'm kind of excited to
try out they'll be really interesting my
mum got me this LMS travel kit beauty
travel kit so he's got some cleansing
water cream cleanser shower cream makeup
remover and body oil and it's really
good this stuff my mom lives by and she
was like you know what I want you to
have some of your own and I was like
okay so yeah and this is great because
his travel sized as well which means I
can take it broad with me and it won't
take up much room in my case because I
do tend to travel quite a bit or a lot
actually hello ah TV the sweets that I
would get every single year are
Maltesers I've got this box of malteses
from my mom and then my dad got me a box
and mold pieces which was like the
king-sized version if you like Maltesers
or you go food shopping a lot you know
which ones I'm talking about I'm gonna
miss out a lot of the food that I got
because if I showed you all the food
that I got given from my family the
video will be about half an hour long
because my family know how much I like
food and I thought these were worth
mentioning
jelly Belly jelly beans please
so good the flavors are just so nice
however the bean boozled challenge is
lucky put me off these my cousin bought
me this candle and it smells so good
it's from next which is like kind of a
clothing slash home decor shop in the UK
and it is so good this candle smells
really nice next I'll like top of the
game in terms of candle scents the scent
is so strong its lemon and bergamot
scented candle is so good so good this
next thing the box is slightly destroyed
because my niece decided it would be a
good idea to chew on it anyway you can
watch my vlog if you want to see my
niece and I basically vlog Christmas Day
as well so if you do want to see that
pedal it's my full channel anyway this
is a blonde instant blush blonde
beautifier basically is a hairspray that
makes your hair even blonder if you have
blonde hair or you can get a purple
version which is literally purple and
that is if your hair is silver I'm
actually planning on getting my hair
gray or silver in the future and I'm
excited I also got earrings two reasons
why I always need earrings one because I
lose everything and two because I have
about 20 piercings in my ears so I
always need quite a few earrings to make
up for that career hole I also got some
more perfume and this one is revealed by
Calvin Klein I've never actually tried
to come in Klein perfume before so it
will be interesting but I have smell it
and it smells really really good from my
auntie I got this suede look Travel /
toiletry bag and inside I have this
earring tray in a bag which is gonna
come in very useful because as I said
before I go through earrings way too
fast I'm constantly loose them because I
am very unreliable I also got the more
free times of jaclyn hill palette
collaboration and i actually borrowed
this from luis in paris and i was like
you know what this is really good i want
it for myself so yeah i got it for
christmas and these are the colors in it
it's absolutely gorgeous and it has all
my red burgundy orange sunset kind of
shades i am absolutely in love with if
you can't tell from my eye look today
which is probably very messed up by now
because it's about 10 o'clock at night
okay I'm gonna do this one now the one
you've may have been waiting for because
no doubt I use this one for clickbait in
the thumbnail of course the louis
vuitton
gift so this is my main gift from my mom
and i was just so happy with this it
completely came as a shock because
originally I was gonna ask for my entire
family
I have a lot of people in my family to
put a bit of money towards getting me a
Louis Vuitton bag and that wouldn't work
out that much between the Malbec silage
they have like over 100 people in my
family there's a lot of people but then
my mom was like you know what I'm just
gonna get it for you and there's reasons
for that that I don't really want to
talk about in this video but I'll
probably talk about in my stripped-down
challenge which is gonna be coming out
after I hit a million subscribers if I
do just a lot of personal things I'm
gonna kind of get off my chest in that
video so you guys can get to know me
more and feel like you really know me
there's a reason behind her spending so
much money and I'm also extremely
grateful and this bag is literally out
to stock everywhere so I have no idea
how this managed to come in to stop my
mom went to the Manchester Selfridges
and they found it in the stockroom and
they thought it was the error because
they like this must be sold out its sold
out everywhere but no he was just hiding
in the stockroom
and it's my little mini Palm Springs
Louie Vuitton backpack and this one is
true the quality of the Louie Vuitton
bags is just absolutely impeccable like
they just feel of the bags it's just
such a good quality and this is a mini
backpack which means it'd be good for
when I go out at nights and stuff but it
also has enough room to fit my purse
chewing gum phone and camera which I
like the main things that I always take
out with me so I am extremely extremely
suited with this I am so in love with it
so I love it also worth mentioning that
I did treat my mom back this Christmas
as well so it wasn't any one way thing
with her getting me this bag if you are
enjoying this video as you are watching
please stick around by pressing that
subscribe button we've got more videos
like they actually there's no more
videos like this coming for another year
but subscribe anyway okay I don't want
to feel like too much of a cringy white
girl who feels the need to name every
single thing that she owned it's like
why should I call the shampoo bottle but
a wash like all this bag see I'm stuck
between a name like Oh Lucy Oh larysa
unfit to be like a really feminine girl
or whether for it to be like a man and
be like Dexter I kind of feel Dexter I
think do we feel Dexter what should I
call her him it let's not assume
something else got that I do want to
show is this light bulb made into a
glass I think home is gonna be really
jealous because I'm kind of stealing his
brand with this but my cept I got it for
me I don't know why I got it I just
thought of you I saw and I was like
thanks but yeah it's quite diet coke in
it if you expected juice or water you
were very
because like water and Diet Coke I live
off and yeah so this I got off my
stepdad and it's a Marc Jacobs kit I
have a Marc Jacobs perfume here and then
here is a body lotion and shower cream
the perfume is absolutely massive it's
100 milliliters which is so much and it
also the perfume is so big that it's its
own bag it comes with a massive chain
attached to it so you can literally wear
it as a shoulder bag interesting very
interesting next thing I'm gonna unpack
it alive because I just came home like
half an hour ago and realize how there
were two presents still under the tree
and it's from my auntie and cousins so
yeah here we go live on boxing what I
got the Christmas oh yeah George when
you're watching this thank you in
advance
oh that is so perfect oh my god right
first of all that bike is absolutely
gorgeous again good for travels it's
literally got my most valued makeup
products in hair and eyeliner which I
absolutely love because I don't like got
it on my waterline now it's got a lip
gloss in here I love my kind of pinky
colored lip glosses as you can tell now
and then it's also I think this is an
eyeshadow palette is it oh yes with very
a neutral kind of everyday colors which
I like a lot that would actually be
really good for this summer time as well
this is the next one Oh sister bag is
like the textured silver material and
likewise for the smaller bag let's see
what's inside
body lotion I really like that packaging
as well is so simple if my room was tidy
I definitely put these up in decor I
will do once I tidy my room which will
be probably in about one okay good thing
is I feel like I tell you my room like
every single day but then within the
next day just gets messy again and I
don't know how cuz I swear all I do is
sleep in my room body wash in the same
packaging all of it and body spray they
look so good together oh my god I ship I
also got another perfume which I'm
definitely not complaining about I can
never have enough perfume I go through
perfumes so fast because I take perfume
everywhere with me this is Hugo Boss I
haven't smelled this one actually it's a
pink color though which is really nice
I'm into it
that's such a good song oh wow that
smells really nice these pillows don't
make me sad face I swear to God and uh
at least the string okay next thing I
got some lounging pajamas which I
absolutely love they are long leg as
well perfect for the winter and with
that I also got a dressing-gown which i
think is in one of the other bags but
the Jesse now is pink it's so soft and
so lovely and I also got some slippers
as well so basically I am all kitted up
for my winter pajama night wear stuff
here it is is so soft it's really really
soft I want to put it on now actually
that feel real good on the skin the pink
and black are really well together as
well and link in the description
whoopsie
teehee I always either sleep in shorts
unlike a vest top or naked so wearing
actual pajama pants is going to be a
challenge but you know what I'm gonna
I'm gonna try a new year new me you know
2018 here I come so you can either some
butter in there some royal jelly with
pure honey hand cream in all different
kind of scents and flavors you might be
watching this video thinking but merely
this isn't a real what I got for
Christmas because one thing's missing
and that is the Lynx Africa set but yes
I got it so now this is officially on
what I got for Christmas video links to
track set sorry but this is really nice
I never complain about this I go through
these so fast as well the Lynx
deodorants okay more perfume this time
is a Vera Wang princess I've heard a
Vera Wang perfume so much but I have no
idea why I feel this is gonna be a big
staple to my perfume collection my
grandma also got me is one of my
presence hair chalk and it's like this
blue hedgehog and I'm like you know what
my day-to-day life
I don't really fancy making my hair blue
but for a video or if I'm feeling edgy
one day I might do it because it's got
the blue chalk there and you like
straighten your hair with it for a
second there I thought the plastic layer
would come off when my hair was gonna be
blue that will be terrifying
yeah hopefully you enjoyed and I'll see
you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
