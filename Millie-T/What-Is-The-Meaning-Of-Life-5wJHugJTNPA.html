deep and it's probably going to end up
being a pretty long video so sorry in
advance of that it's going to be very
open to debate and this video is going
to be very opinionated with my beliefs
but any of your beliefs you have I'd
love to hear them if you want to comment
them in the comment section and we can
get a conversation going about it but
try to not get it into an argument
because there's no point no one knows
the true answer you know it's all just
theories and beliefs just to clarify I'm
not depressed or anything like that
mostly pretty happy person questions we
don't know the answer for that are
pretty big questions I love to talk
about so that's why this video is being
created all throughout my life I've been
really interested in kind of questions
the meaning of life how did we get here
why are we here things like that um and
I think it all stems from my love with
the universe and researching the
universe as a whole and I'm not lying
about any of this and I'd like to think
I kind of know what I'm talking about
with it I'll show you this this is a
book I DIY when I was a kid um well okay
about two years ago and it's my science
book and it's got everything about space
soul system and side that a4 sheets
paper and I know you can see the text
there but everything from quantum
mechanics to the string theory to
Einstein's theory of relativity to
cosmic microwave background and I just
loved it and that books been full so I
think my interest in the meaning of life
and questions and topics should do with
that all stemmed from my love of the
universe because the more you know about
the universe the less you know so doing
all that research led me to kind of ask
what the meaning of life was and deep
questions like that why we're here what
is the point of life and all that it's
not like suicidal thoughts or anything
like that just kind of questioning it
like why are we here what is the point
and about how often I thought about it
and how much I tried to use my own
knowledge on the universe and stuff to
answer them I just get
anywhere I figured out that you would
never know the answer to it of course
it's just something a question you'll
never actually know the answer unless
something like a miracle happens it's
just always going to be theorized and
based on people's beliefs so I think
from there I just kind of thought to
myself you know what I'm just going to
create my own meaning to life I think
that's what we should all do in a way
create our own meaning and create our
own purpose to life and whether that be
relationships whether that be family
whether it be a religious reason whether
you think the meaning of life is a trial
and how you behave in this life depicts
what happens in your afterlife or
whether your meaning to life is travel
and that's mine my meaning to life and
my purpose to life a main goal that I
want to achieve is travel I want to
experience the world I want to see it
and then I have a big list of places
where I want to go as well we're on a
travel and not really backpacking travel
more like a 12 month vacation holiday
where I see the world and yeah bit more
on the luxurious end of the spectrum
rather than earth traveling and not
knowing where else to go next although
that would definitely be an experience
and something I would definitely be open
to to be honest and I kind of envy very
religious people
I'm not hugely religious I mean I do
kind of believe in the God I really do
but I don't really go to church and some
people might look at that and think
right you don't a Christian that if you
don't want to church completing God well
I don't know I mean my belief goes a
different way to having to the Bible in
church and stuff I just believe in their
being a superior being kind of helps us
out every now and again I don't really
know what I believe to be honest it's
hard to explain something that you don't
quite understand yourself but I envy
really religious people that follow the
Bible because in the Bible they will
find that purpose whether that be you
know this life being a trial which will
depict what happens in your afterlife
Allah and in that you found your boat
logically got your purpose to life and
your life will be fulfilled if you live
by that purpose
you know not my feeling traveling is a
real meaning of life I suppose I've come
up my own definition for the meaning of
life as well I think as a whole summed
up the meaning of life should be
happiness and however you go about
finding that happiness is your meaning
so to me happiness a big happiness a man
will be travelling which would be my
purpose someone else it might be
relationships and family they are so
important to me as well I feel that you
have to create your own meaning as well
when you get to the end of your life and
you look back on your life if you have
goals that you've fulfilled even a
bucket list and you've got you've
completed that feeling of fulfillment
will come from completing those things a
lot of people would love will be happy
to live in average comfortable life
which is fair enough
good on you I am jealous of you again
what an average life is just not me this
might sound a bit bad but I kind of look
at people that are now retired and have
kind of gone through the main section of
their life I look at them and I just
think I how can you be happy with how
your life's turned out and to them they
will be how they might be happy with
their lives which is good on them but
for my perspective and how I want my
life to turn out when I look at their
life I just kind of think you could have
done so much with your life
why didn't you why don't you travel see
the world why don't you take more time
doing this and it's a very biased
opinion because I'm just living life by
I'm just judging their life by how I
want my life to be which isn't right in
a way and they're probably very happy
with our lives but just something like I
just do it a lot he'll look at the lives
I just think I kind of feel bad for them
in a way and it's not very good is it to
be honest and right now in my life I
feel lost like people some people you
know follow a path to life I don't have
a path I don't know what I want to do I
don't know what job I want to have every
single job that I've looked at I don't
want to do but I'm gonna have to do one
thing this template that society has set
out you know the rules to live for
you've got to go to school get a job
then you've got to get a job to pay
food and basic human needs like food
shelter water then you've got to keep
working to earn that money and then
eventually you'll be tired but then when
you retire you're exhausted you don't
want to do anything then you just want
to chill and relax you have to abide by
that template this is I just left out
because if you don't you don't get money
if you don't get an education you don't
get money you need money like I said
before for shelter and food and spending
money on your kids and pets even my case
there'll be a lot of pets and when I
always ask people you know like I asked
it a lot like what do you regret in your
life and it probably makes them feel a
little bit shitty they never say oh I
did this when I was young when I regret
doing that on and on they don't know no
chance of they just say I regret not
taking this job opportunity because I
was doing this instead all right I
didn't do this out of fear like you just
seize every opportunity that you get
basically there's obviously exceptions
but for the most part if you have an
opportunity that you really want to
pursue but you can't just ties back home
or due to fear just do it you only live
once and I think every single this is
going to be really hard to explain but I
think like every single human being just
believes that the world revolves around
them subconscious like they don't do it
they don't think I'm so much more
important than all you like don't think
that consciously but subconsciously we
all kind of hope that we are special
whether it be this world is just a
figment about our imagination whether it
be that God created you specially we are
all aware of our own consciousness
but we're not aware of all the people's
consciousness there's not okay so
there's a film called The Truman Show
and it's basically got and Jim Carrey in
it and he lives his life like all of us
but then he figures but then it turns
out that everyone in this life is an
actor and he's a whole life is a TV show
literally a TV show and everyone else
are actors in this TV show and he's the
only one that's not I feel like that's
how a lot of us kind of live like we
think that we're special
and and that it's all going to work out
for us
and that our goals are just going to
come to us because we're special in life
I didn't quite finish my points I forgot
I was actually trying to make a point
but basically what I was saying with
that was that we all the thing that was
special in life and human beings as a
whole very special but individually
we're no more special than another human
being and things aren't just going to
work out for us so any goals you have
you will have to work for please don't
just expect them to come to you because
they won't you will have to work for
them but it will be worth it in the end
literally never give up on your dreams
very cliche but true and with the money
that you earn from whatever job you end
up having spend it on experiences rather
than things with experiences and things
like that you can take them to the grave
with you and at the end of your life
when you're on your deathbed looking
back at the life that you lived you will
feel a lot more filled and happy and
content with your life when you look
back on it and have memories
relationships you've formed experiences
where we're spending your money on
things doesn't matter you know you the
only reason you probably bought the
muster boost your ego must abuse your
ego in this life but when you'll need
death bed none of that matters things
really get point of perspective I guess
I mean I don't know but I feel like they
would get put into perspective a lot
when you're looking back and you really
gonna look back on that pair of
Louboutins shoes you spend 525 pounds on
and think you know what that's great but
I feel great with myself now I'm not
seeing don't spend it on things like
that because hey I bought the iPhone 7
did I really need it probably not I
could have lived off the iPhone 4s but I
did but when you have an opportunity to
spend it on one thing or another and one
of those is an experience and the other
is a materialistic object spend on the
experience you'll be a lot better for it
I mean I do that now in a way I mean
whether this fad I spent money on
festivals and experiences and going out
with friends meals and stuff like that
rather than clothes what I know I spend
a lot money on food actually that's why
I'm gonna change though
I will change this one message I want to
spread its to live life to its fullest
make the most out of the life that you
have
I realize how blessed well like I'm
saying all this but I do realize how
blessed I am so I have gel trim
interview have food and drink more than
I could ever need
I have a family that loves me I have a
great set of friends of it if you have
that you are so blessed you know you
don't understand how lucky you are
what at the same time problems that we
face are very subjective so you can't
really look at someone to go off you
have depression because you boyfriend
broke up with you this kids in Africa
that are starving you know that good
one-liner it's subjective they don't
know how it feels to be starving so how
can you expect me to relate to that how
can you expect that person to just gone
through a breakup or lost their best
friend to go you know what I shouldn't
be crying because it's kids starving in
Africa that could work for some people
but not really because they don't know
how it feels so subjective to how you
feel about things so I just kind of
wanted to put that hours in bonus points
while that kind of relates to and stuff
that I've said and these are the
motivational quotes so as well in life
these poles are mainly about living life
to its fullest and solitude one of them
is one of them's just and general this
is kind of one that I created myself
it's probably or it is probably a quote
I'm not going to be one of those you
know like I created this give me credit
and this is just little ism that I
thought I wonder if your whole life was
being made into a book so as you live
your life songs writing out
word-for-word your whole life granted
the books probably gonna be like massive
um but good tender people have the time
to like read it after you die and after
you die everyone in the world gets your
book and it's given out to every single
human being are they going to want to
read that book or they gonna kind of
read it and skip pages and just kind of
like oh this is and throw it away
are they gonna be like oh my god oh my
god yes like Jesus she did that that
happened you know it's always your life
is being if you treat your life is a
book you're going to live a really happy
life because you're going to seize every
opportunity that you get because you're
you can be like that'll be of
a chapter in my book I don't know some
that I thought of and another quote is
in the end we only regret the chances
that we didn't take if you ask people
what their main regrets are in life
you'll never really hear them say I did
this when I was a kid and I regret it a
lot it'll probably be I had this
opportunity and then take it when I
should have done except if I took it I
probably will be here right now I like
whatever they might say so yeah um live
life to its fullest and seize every
opportunity that you get basically and
if you abide by them of course your life
will have meaning you'll find meaning to
your life
