is gonna be kind of like a life update
video I guess and basically I want you
guys to kind of be kept in the loop of
my life and stuff and I really want you
to feel like you actually know me so I
thought that I would explain like where
I'm going with life right now because
obviously everyone's going back to
school of the minute and when you see
that I'm not back at school you're
probably gonna be wondering like what
the hell I'm doing cuz I do vlog as well
I have like a blogging channel that I
upload videos on and I've also done a
vlog explaining like why I left school
already but I want to bring it over to
my main channel because that's where a
lot more of you are I already know what
comments we're gonna get from people
being like oh yeah what happened think
about long-term what are you gonna do in
the far future because YouTube's not
gonna be around forever
kind of thing yeah I know that but
hopefully when I explain more in this
video with where I'm at maybe you'll
understand a bit more by the way this
video it's gonna be extremely personal
you're probably gonna feel like you
really know me after this video so yeah
hopefully you've prepared for that so
last December I like got into a habit of
watching travel diary videos I was
watching people skydiving over Dubai I
was watching couples traveling the world
together you know even the jl resin
alexis run videos I was just like
constantly watching them and I remember
thinking like what am I gonna get to do
this because I can't travel alone for a
long while yet because I'm only 16 and
then I've got sick form and then I'm
gonna go to uni so what am I actually
gonna get to travel and it turned out
that I'd have to wait until the gap here
between sick form and uni like
realistically which was a long time for
me to wait and I started to become
really like unhappy it's waste it
sounded because I felt trapped like I
actually felt trapped in this like
societal structure that swarmed through
going to sick form and you anything and
a job a lot of people don't mind that a
lot of people are happy to do that
because you want to go into medicine and
stuff and a lot of people don't mind a
societal structure because it's like
stable and if you want to go into
medicine then like it's either got a
perfect path laid out for them for it so
I completely get that completely but I
wanted to travel
nice what I wanted to do and it was okay
well how am I gonna do this then Alicia
gets the point I'll sign class for
watching travel diaries and travel
and stuff and just people doing weird
 in life and I remember just
watching and thinking that's what I want
to be doing right now when I was like in
class I remember I was site chemistry
watching these videos at this point I'm
pretty sure I just hit a hundred
thousand subscribers and I was over the
moon about that but I hadn't even began
to think about youtubers like a
full-time like career option because it
was literally just a hobby something
I've done since 2008 when I uploaded
like two singing videos and then like we
started my channel like properly and in
like 2013 and then I properly properly
started this kind of channel like last
year so yeah that was throughout the
entirety of January it's been like
really sad and I think she's feeling
traps and not knowing what to do I
didn't even know what I wanted to do in
the future
I told myself wanted to do psychology
but looking back and didn't even want to
do that
there was not one thing that appealed to
me to do that I could like that I'd had
to go that I'd have to go through six
momen and you need to do so if you came
around and I released the eBay videos
the eBay just testing video and I'd had
that video idea in my head for so long I
thought you know what I'm gonna do it so
I did the video load there I expected it
to do well but nowhere near as well as
it did like I'm pretty sure it's
something like seven million views right
now like I remember the day after that I
was going down to London to YouTube
space never been in the car in the
morning and being like I wonder how many
big video did and it had half a million
views in like ten hours and I was like
oh my god it also had a lot of Hayek's
it here the trending page and that's
when you get a lot of videos being like
what did you expect your three dollars I
was like that's the whole point of the
video that's why I was doing it because
I knew they'd be bad like obviously uh
let me get me started I just think warm
you up some point and then from that
I've kept uploading like eBay videos and
wish videos and I generally like enjoy
doing those videos and and I remember
much I'll just obviously kept on growing
and I remember at the end of the month
there and looking at like what I've made
on YouTube in terms of money and I mean
I don't want it to be all that money cuz
it's really not but like I was looking
at it it's like a stable career option
I'm gonna and some explaining that side
of the story I am gonna have to bring it
into the story so I wrote it
I remember looking at I member looking
at it and thinking wow well I can make a
living out of this like Wow okay
but it was still very early stages it
was like the first one that ever made
enough to like kind of live off and
because again like YouTube really isn't
about the money for me like it's really
really not however now I just need to
make enough to live off and then I'm
happy because obviously I don't want to
be living out on the streets I rely on
each of now so yeah that was the first
month that I was like okay I can
actually kind of make something out a
few cheaper guess like if this carries
on then Wow so remember but it was still
very early stages so I sat on mum down
and I was like you didn't realize it
like if I used to channel what to ever
take off like would you let me not go to
sick form and do it full-time
I'm almost like well we'll see if that
ever happens sure yeah but now no that
was up my mom is so spoiled of
everything like so unbelievably
supportive
it was probably April time that I
actually said to my mom you know I might
I don't think I need to go to sick form
because the one thing I've always said
in life is you need to find a job that
you enjoy doing because you spend a good
chunk of your life doing that job I mean
obviously you probably are gonna go
through six jobs in your life maybe or
you might even stick to one and just
progress up that one and but either way
you're gonna be working for a hell of a
lot of your life so you really do need
to find a job that you love because if
not you will have a miserable life if
you are working a job that you hate
because that's just obvious because most
of your life is working because you've
got to make a living from it so just
finds from that you enjoy doing and to
me
that thing was YouTube and obviously I
didn't I never had the intention to do
it full-time howlite when I started in
2008 it was barely thing and then when I
properly started it's in 2000 and now a
lot of - singing videos and then just
left them up and then delete them a few
years later and then they got like 300
views I'm pretty sure and then in 2012
or 2013 2013 I think it was I blowed my
first gymnastics tutorial video and that
was like on this channel here so you
now and I all these obviously twelve
years old I didn't even think Oh 13
years old I don't even think about
having it as a job like at all I just
who's doing it for fun and I feel about
it just as fun and not having it as a
job into like December so yeah a hell of
a lot of time of it being like just a
hobby so I have a massive passion for
YouTube like a massive passionate this
it makes me happy it makes me happy mean
you guys in public it makes me half of
the things that come with it the freedom
that I get uploading a video and see in
the comments assume is like I love that
video people I've met through YouTube
I've met like my best friends through
YouTube it's crazy like it's actually if
I didn't have YouTube like I don't I
don't even know my life would just not
be as good as it is now anywhere near I
then sat my mum down and I was like okay
I'm pretty sure I don't need to go to
sick form I don't know if you'll let me
not go to sick form but it's a
possibility that you let me do YouTube
and just give that a go and my mom was
like oh I don't know like yes I can see
completely way coming from but it's also
scary as a mom for me to let you do that
I was like yeah that's completely fair
enough she went around was asking all of
her friends for advice and I was going
around asking all my friends for advice
I was asking you I was asking even my
teachers I was asking literally everyone
what do I do
and it was hard getting advice from
people because obviously they would
really understand there I asked to teach
and they were like oh let me go to sick
form it site yeah thanks Patrick of
course you'd say that my thing of
thinking was I would never ever ever be
able to do youtube and stick film at the
same time like so I just thought to
myself I've spent so long going this
channel it's what made me happy in life
my best memories the places that I've
been the places that I am going because
of YouTube I can't like I just can't
throw that away everything that I would
love to do in life even acting I can get
there through YouTube even though
YouTube is my main focus at the minute
talking about leaving on to things in
the future you've got acting you've got
presenting you've got anything within
the media YouTube can help get you there
I look to them separately and I looked
at YouTube and I was like I've met
amazing people through YouTube I've been
places that I would have never even
dreamt of going
this age because of YouTube I mean I
went to LA in June along with to my best
YouTube friends call me and Spencer and
had the best time we went alone paid for
it all about paid for it all ourselves
filmed every day what we were out there
made amazing content loved every second
of it and that was because of YouTube
that I even met them in the first place
as well and went to LA that was because
of YouTube before that we went to
Amsterdam because of YouTube for VidCon
even as little as spending a weekend in
London with them and stuff because of
YouTube and having the best time ever I
looked all the things that YouTube have
brought me so meeting obviously meeting
friends freedom to be able to do what
you want the support you get the amazing
viewers you guys mean you out in public
just having that support if I was ever
upset and you just want to talk to I
feel literally love on Twitter post one
tweet and I would have so many of you
being like DM me I want to talk talk to
me I'm sorry and I just have that
support instantly you don't get that
with any of the job I've actually got
this what you say like you don't get
that with any of the job and a job it
feels made even : a job so I look to all
that from YouTube the thing that has
made me most happy since I was 13 when I
probably started doing it I remember I
fell out with a friend once when I was
really young we're still amazing friends
now but like we went through like a
rough patch because all I ever talked
about was YouTube um and she was
probably right for I was just obsessed
with there and that was at the time when
I had like probably a thousand
subscribers or so and then I looked at
sick form I had no idea what I wanted to
do a sick form no idea what options I
wanted no idea what a job I wanted to go
into in the future I would have kept
going to the sixth form that was
connected to my school because that's
where all my friends were going and it
was just a lot easier and I didn't want
to do that I didn't like the look of it
looks like it wasn't mmm the place I
really wanted to go but you would have
got the best education that's why one of
the best sick forms around but I still
like didn't really want to go
because it would have been the same
thing that the experience for the past
five years can you use like the same
classroom this is the main school and
stuff and it's an amazing sick ball in
law like honestly I guess I was just
bored of living the same life over and
over again I would have also had to
completely push you to the side because
when I wanted to in sick form was going
to medicine I wanted to do psychiatry
anything like even like being a doctor
just something going into the field of
medicine and and that would leave no
time for YouTube like no time whatsoever
so I would have had to say bye-bye to my
youtube channel and I could never do
that I I couldn't like it's just as
simple as that like I just can't uh uh
so I just decided to do YouTube
full-time and this was just before my
GCSEs I decided to do this and with the
help of my mom as well she was
completely supportive completely
understood where I was coming from when
I asked to not do sick form but she just
said the deal to me which was like you
work as hard as you can for your GCSEs
get them get good results and then if
you need to go too sick from the year
later you can and if your child dies for
some reason so I was like that's
completely fair enough
so I worked hard for my GCSEs I mean I
still didn't advise as much as I could
have done because YouTube did again take
up my entire weekends because throughout
the week I was revising and then on the
weekends I like spent all my weekend on
YouTube site filming and Sunday editing
and one day uploading I still did work
hard though I did quite a lot revision I
then went to my GCSEs and I did them I
came out with a seven in English
language which is like in a high a I
think I'm not sure yeah it's a high a I
came out with a B in maths which was
like a six and I came out with an 8 in
English literature which was an a star I
came out with bees in my sciences and
then everything else was A's I'm very
sure and then maybe like another bee I
got like a bee in Spanish but I think of
an A in history as well I didn't go
lower than a bee so I was really happy
with my results because the thing that I
just wanted was like stable results so
if I do need to go back to sick form
next year I can do because I have those
results they thought of going back to
stick form next year actually like hurts
me because I'm just enjoying life way
too much of the minute
I feel so blessed to be in this position
keep in mind this is just my way of
thinking because like I've experienced
YouTube thing that's different with you
who's watching this is that you most
likely will have a vague idea of what
you want to do so you might want to go
into sports medicine anything you want
to do you like only have that in your
head and you're like working towards
that the only thing that I had in my
head was YouTube and working towards
that so I had no idea wanted what I
actually wanted to do in life no idea
which is why I was so upset and like not
really knowing what to do and I also
really wanted to travel like big time so
keep in mind I'm not saying like oh yeah
you should hate your life because you're
going to sit for more college and no
this is just literally reason why I hate
the idea of sick form so much was
because I would have had to equip
YouTube and there's nothing that I would
hate more in life than having to quit
usually because it's what has made me
very happy
and for a lot of years I've just never
felt alone because of you guys because
again I can log onto Twitter log on to
my Instagram and just see thousands and
thousands of you like giving me love and
stuff like that and I am extremely
extremely grateful for that like you
will never even understand I I just
appreciate you all a lot so am i
terrified of my youtube channel dying
and yeah pretty much I'm just kind of I
am terrified of it slowly going downhill
as the months progress and then it gets
to July next year I'm thinking wow okay
well it was a good run but I've got to
go too sick for now and do whatever and
yeah that's terrifying honestly that is
absolutely terrifying but I would have
had to quit YouTube anyway if I went to
sick form so I just need to work as hard
as I can this year to keep you to
producing content for you guys keep
opening up for new things in the future
and my vlogging channel as well as
something that I absolutely love if you
ever want to get to know me more like
feel like you actually know me as a best
friend you just watch my vlogging
channel and you'll probably feel like
that excited don't hold anything back on
that and I don't have that many vlogs
actually if you want to catch up with
them and then keep watching them at
every time like I upload a vlog and I
don't even care about the views of my
vlogging channel like I genuinely don't
I just want it to be a place that those
who want to get to know me
feel like they genuinely do know me and
so this year everyone goes back to
school on Wednesday it is currently
Sunday so holy yeah I am not yet a high
school dropout until Wednesday and then
as soon as 12 a.m. on Wednesday I'm
officially a high school dropout because
technically I'm still a student at the
minute because it's like the war
something like that I don't know and all
that by the way before anyone talked
about the law in the UK and stuff all
that it like because you have to stay in
education until you're 18 there is a
loophole with that or not even a
loophole this just allowances with that
and like YouTube is one of those it's
like self-employment and stuff it's a
really long story I don't want to get
too technical with it but I am not
breaking the law trust me I have
everything sorted out you just got to
sign it on the forms and stuff which I
am doing it's weird though because I
don't have my life planned out properly
so I've had an amazing summer I have
been away with YouTube friends recently
I got back a few days ago I went to iron
a per with Spencer and Adam wife and and
I had absolutely amazing time there
honestly that wasn't even a work holiday
though we said we'd vlog daily and then
ended up getting up like 4:00 p.m. every
day so that wall went out the window
I've just been doing stuff all summer
and and now when all my friends go back
to school I'm like oh okay what do I do
now because I can't do anything during
the day because all my friends at school
don't know why YouTube friends live down
south so I don't really know I just what
I'm gonna do I'm pretty sure is just
grind really hard on YouTube because I'm
gonna have not a lot to do during the
day because as I said all my friends are
at school so what I'm gonna do is use
that time to grind with YouTube daily
vlog I'm probably spend a lot of time
with my mom since she's not working as
well I'm gonna hit the gym dice when
that I am gonna do and just keep
uploading and I'm gonna try and go away
at least once a month to like abroad I
think I'm pretty sure this month we are
going to be going to September we're
gonna be going to September we're gonna
be going to Paris me call me and Spencer
and just having a sick time there and
kitai thing is I really want carrots
gone carob Bridgette she's really like
really close YouTube friend but she's
going to sixth form so she's gonna so
she's gonna be a school and we go away
which is annoying so we're gonna have to
go away with Keira when it's like the
holidays and stuff actually I have got
stuff plan as well tomorrow I'm going to
tell his show with Keira
because carry a collab channel so I'm
just kind of like chill there and
discourse and acts it's in Manchester my
hometown and I do have things lined off
the future as well it's taking me so
long to come out with merch like since
January because I tried creating it
myself at first when I was on it wasn't
happy with it scratched it and then I
joined studio71 who then like helped
create your merge they sent through
samples I didn't like any of them I sent
them back and then I told him what I
wanted cuz I got an idea of my merch and
then they sent new designs through I saw
design number one I just have tweaked it
manually like I've done my own thing
with it and tweaked it so it's more like
how I want it to be like with the fonts
and stuff but I cannot wait for you to
see it I'm pretty sure you'll like it
this is a hint here and me is one him on
the jumpers there's also something else
it's in such early stages I have a
meeting fair in September I like oh my
god I'm just in such a happy place right
now like with the future and things
planned and just I'm just excited
because I finally don't feel trapped
anymore I have more freedom that I would
have ever liked thought that I would
have like last December looking back and
I know I saw like first of all problems
like oh you couldn't travel when you
wanted to how depressing like yeah I
know like yeah it is so first of all
problems I know but I mean the stage I
was at was I just like was not excited
for the next like 10 years of my life
before I could have a job and then kind
of settle down and like I just wasn't
happy and I was not looking forward to
those next years of my life and that
actually drains you a lot more than
you'd think
like it just genuinely does I didn't
know what to do myself
I think the reason why I won't like tour
watching traveled Irish food was because
I felt like I was like living through
that person like you know if you watch
vlogs and stuff people doing like
amazing stuff and you're like okay this
is a way for me to like experience that
that was a lot like I was doing with
watching those travel diaries and
basically my life goal is to just die
with memories
not dreams die with memories and not
dream so it's just the main thing that
if I would ever want to share with you
guys and I also want this video to be a
thank you video to you guys for
literally just making me happy
literally you watching this even if
you've only just found me through this
video like thank you you have allowed me
to live this life have this freedom be
happy have like direction in my life as
well to know what I want to do I mean I
don't have direction because I am like
self-employed like this is my own
business and I do what I want with it
which is scary to an extent because I
don't know what I want to do because I'm
16 but I'm trying my best and I'm gonna
try my best so vlogs are gonna keep
coming as well whenever I have a good
day that I wanna vlog which is probably
gonna be tomorrow as well when I mean it
with my little pleb camera a little fave
and I'm gonna be vlogging that as well
yeah thank you guys thank you a lot for
just being here supporting me it is if I
can actually like feel your presence as
I'm talking cuz it feels like it's
already uploaded to the Internet as
weird as that sounds I will look at the
viewfinder I kind of picture it already
been on YouTube and you already watching
this so I already like feel that
connection through that um but I will
never be able to repay you guys for
everything that you've done for me the
best way that I know to do that is to
just keep creating content that you'll
hopefully love and stay active on my
social medias I'm actually gonna go live
on Instagram after this and thank you
guys again because I feel like I need to
I I don't like the idea of crying in
front of a camera and so even though I'm
a youtuber so inevitably that will
happen at some point in the near future
I will cry on camera over some kind of
situation thank you guys and here's to
the next year of me trying to make this
work thank you very much for listening
to my rant or not even rant my excellent
my story you probably feel like you know
me a lot now and you should because I
literally allow everything in this video
so thank you very much for watching and
I will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
