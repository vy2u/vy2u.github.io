video is going to be snow day essentials
/ winter day essentials I'm not exactly
sure where I'm gonna call the video yet
but you'll know by now anyway buddy just
looking at the title so luckily for us
today at our school we got a snow day
because here in England it has kind of
been snowing a little bit very quickly I
do want to mention that I have now got a
second channel the link will be in the
description below so just click on that
link and please subscribe to my second
channel as there should be video on it
by the end of tonight or maybe tomorrow
I'm not too sure when I'll be uploading
that but yeah go check it out so the
first thing you're going to need is a
snapchat to brag that your school is
closed so that is generally a good place
to start and my description says
bragging because school is closed so now
that you've told everybody that has you
on that snapchat contact list that
school is closed you can now head on to
Instagram and post a school is closed
selfie or maybe even want to Facebook as
well you know I'll just use all your
social medias to tell everyone that your
school is closed because everybody cares
and the second thing you're going to
need is a friend to spend the day with
unless you'd rather spend a day and I'm
Netflix ed I completely understand but
if you do want to be a bit more
adventurous and actually get out from
your bed then you can actually bring a
friend and either tell me you want to do
something or get annoyed because you're
going to do something but that never did
so I'm going to increase because I'm
rather annoyed at her I know I we were
gonna spin the day together today what
even happened
it's ridiculous like well I'm gonna ring
you but then I didn't get up until like
half past 10 so yeah yeah kind of my
fault
but you need to check if you're free
Valentine's weekend and I still need to
kind of ask my mom
oh yeah it's good isn't it I'm thinking
of filming a YouTube video today going
to be snow day essentials inviting a
friend around to play which was you but
yeah you know you just completely bailed
on me so okay bye-bye
what is it bitch so if your friend bails
on ya like mine did then you can just
play with yourself next if you do end up
doing something with your friend then
you'll probably go out sex is snowing
unless you kinda watch Netflix with your
friend obviously like a better idea to
me but you'll just go outside and
because the weather is quite harsh you
need your moisturizer for your legs arms
on face cuz mice is facing you're drying
a lot people's can in the winter time
and you will also need some lip butter
because chapped lips
they ain't pretty you probably saw this
one coming but you will need a computer
to watch it netflix on it because
seriously netflix is top of my list when
it comes to things to do on snow days
obviously you won't you don't need a
macro anything any completely can even
watch on your ipad your phone your ipod
netflix if you haven't got it I would
highly highly recommend it so yes
Netflix definitely important right now I
have a honeycomb crush so whilst I watch
Netflix I will tend to eek when she's
mini ones so I can eat more and not real
as fat and also
Cinda toffee which is basically like
just the inside of a cone shape and if
you want to get really festive for the
wintertime I would say a very nice drink
to have with your could generally call
and Netflix and maybe friend if you
watching Netflix with your friend
obviously hot chocolate
but not just hot chocolate on your hot
chocolate you will need whipped cream
sprinkles and marshmallows that is
essential and mean curse they have a
theme Oh tradition sorry where whenever
we go to one another's houses we have to
have make hot chocolate if you want to
know more about that or you want to see
you living proof of it just go to my
Instagram I haven't actually like post
every single picture for a hot chocolate
we've made ever but it's on my Instagram
if you live in England it's not a rocket
science to kind of figure out that it's
cold extremely cold and sometimes even
with the heating on it's still extremely
cold so it's a fluid blanket this is a
throw but it's a really good quality
throw and it's huge it's probably bigger
than my bed in general so just grab your
throw nestled up with you throw with
your food and drink and Netflix and just
chill out and if you want another way to
chill out then make yourself a nice warm
bubbly bath I have to make it bubbly use
a lush fun bath or bubble vine just
crumble that under the running tap so
just use this stop bubble bar so you'll
just swirl it around in your bath and it
will create lots of bubbles and then you
can actually reuse it again and I wrap
all of my bath lush bath bombs in cling
film so I can see what they are and so
keep them fresh if you want a bath bomb
that will go well with this little star
then pair it with candy mountain because
smell really good together
they just be blend really well but if
you're in quite a fiery mood and you're
feeling quite adventurous lingo for
Phoenix Rising sis is a while the spices
cinnamon
with a slight hint of loving to smelling
it and if you don't want to let go on
Christmas then just go for this little
cute Christmas joke here I comment what
this one's cold but it looks just like a
head joke
how cute is that it's so blue and
glittery but the nose sometimes falls
off and it's a bit of a dimension
looking Hedgehog but that is sent if the
video I really hope you enjoyed all of
these tips I gave you I hope you'll use
some of them and it was a little bit of
a joke not a huge joke so there is still
some tips that you can use in this video
but I do hope that you enjoy it
have a wonderful day and don't get stay
positive mwah bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
