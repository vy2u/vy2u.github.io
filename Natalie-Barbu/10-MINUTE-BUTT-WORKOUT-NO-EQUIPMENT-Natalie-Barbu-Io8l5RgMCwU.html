I am going a fitness workout for you
guys this is my very first like actual
workout with me fitness workout and I'm
so excited because I have been wanting
to do one of these for a very long time
so with that being said though just know
that I am NOT a personal trainer I'm not
certified or anything but I have been
doing but workouts for a very long time
because I used to have literally nothing
it was like this like nothing and now I
have a little bit of a curve and it
really is all just one big muscle so if
you train it and you work it out you
will get the book that you want and if
you already have a big butt and you
don't want your butt to get bigger don't
worry cuz butt workouts are just gonna
make it nice toned and tight and lift it
which who doesn't want that so the
reason amount of breath is because I
just did it and now I'm building the
intro so I'm a little out of breath but
anything definitely a tough workout but
it is so effective and it is so quick so
I compiled all of my favorite workouts
that I have done in the past put them
into this video I find that these are
the most effective they definitely have
lifted my booty up and if you guys want
to see more fitness videos or any other
muscle parts or more buff workouts let
me know and give this video a thumbs up
and if you're new to this channel be
sure to subscribe I post a lot of like
lifestyle college videos and we're
really close to 100k so that would mean
the world to me if you could subscribe
but I know that you came here to workout
so let's get started this first workout
is the donkey kick so you're going to
start on all fours and bring one of your
legs right underneath you and then kick
it up I have my foot flex so just follow
what I'm doing but this is definitely
gonna work your glute make sure that the
only thing that's moving and that you're
working is the lower part of your body
you don't want your body to be flailing
everywhere so yeah just flex your foot
and you go push up and make sure that
your glutes are thing it's super simple
but trust me you guys it definitely
definitely burns and now we're gonna
pull so at 30 seconds I know it sucks
but the good thing is you're just
getting started so it shouldn't be that
painful so pulse it out little tiny
pulses you guys pulse pulse pulse the
reason I'm doing a voiceover is because
there's no way I can talk and do this at
the same time so don't know how people
do that let me know if you're a fitness
person and
can actually talk by the end of this
workout but I can't so we're doing mini
pulses all right now for the next one
fire hydrants so take a break if you
need to but try not to take any breaks
so the fire hydrants very simple limit
what a dog does when he's peeing that's
where it gets its name from we're doing
all of this on these same side of the
body so we're starting out with one
shirt and legs do whichever one that you
guys choose but just keep on lifting it
and you can go fast you can go slow I
like starting slow and going fast sadly
we can't pulse it out for this one but
the rest of them you guys at 30 seconds
we're gonna post so we're just gonna
keep doing the fire hydrant just make
sure to work your butt again make sure
your whole body isn't going everywhere
whenever I do these on all fours I like
to tighten up my ABS so that's what I'm
doing and these kale by the end of them
you guys seriously your butt's not on
fire by minute five you're doing it
wrong because these are so so hard oh my
gosh and I'm gonna keep talking because
then it's gonna get through quicker if
you guys just have a conversation meet
you'll go by quick
next up lunges so these lunges are just
single leg lunges this is so important
but make sure that your knee does not go
over your toe sometimes I catch myself
doing that but I make sure to fix it
right away super super important there's
the number one thing I see whenever I
work out with my friends their knees go
like so far past their toes and I'm just
like oh my gosh you're gonna get injured
so please make sure you're not doing
that also make sure you can get as low
as you can I go just above the ground I
don't touch the ground but here's for
the killer because we are going to do
pulses you guys yes this hurts I know it
burns I know it hurts you guys I was
dying while doing this we cannot see my
face because I just didn't have a good
set up but I literally was dying doing
these so these are the words and I was
already sore on my legs so this did not
help at all but
ten seconds definitely can do this super
super quick like just it's gonna go by
quickly I promise you and by the end of
it your bets gonna look so good and next
these you are going to get on one knee
and one arm and make sure to be tracing
me the entire time do not look down
don't turn your body down make sure to
have great form and you are just gonna
hike one leg up so touch have your toe
tap the floor and then up tap the floor
and then tap the floor and then up to
try to get about hip length I think that
is a good indicator of if you're doing
it well you can only go a little a few
inches off the floor that's fine too but
now we're gonna pulse I know
kills you guys seriously Rick killed me
and if you guys can see my face but you
guys gonna scream at me you guys want to
just scream in general you guys just
want to breathe in and out or maybe you
guys are like Natalie this is so
freaking easy good for you do this video
twice then because I thought it was
pretty hard and if you guys want me to
shut up
let me know but I feel like it's more
entertaining when you have someone
talking to you and motivating you and
now we are doing bridges so these are
one of my favorites it's very awkward to
do in public because you're literally
hipster resting in the air and it is
awkward but you know what these are so
beyond effective so this you're not
working any specific leg but we're gonna
be doing this twice so yep we're doing
hip thrusts hip thrusts is that what
they're called hip bridges and make sure
that you are squeezing your glute the
very top that is what is effective about
this workout is the waning squeeze and
we are about to do pulses you guys yep
you know what's coming I know that you
did but pulse pulse pulse and squeeze a
penny between your butts and I know that
sounds weird but you got to squeeze a
penny between your cheeks and that's how
you're gonna do the right form so I know
it's super super weird and I feel like
I'm just like talking so much and you
guys are probably I don't know let me
know if you guys like talking or not
because it is my first fitness video
let me know after you're done with the
workout and some even got this far and
how do you feel because if you can't
tell I was literally dying and now we're
doing the whole thing over again you
guys thought that you were in pain well
too bad because you're doing it over but
on the opposite side obviously it's a
little weird both cheeks you can't just
have one cheek that's work so now again
donkey kicks obviously as you guys see
and give yourself like a five-second
break if you guys need to to switch
sides because I know I didn't give a
very good transition but yeah transition
over to donkey kicks and make sure that
your glute is working and you guys know
at the thirty Seconds let's come in yep
it's the pulses so we're just gonna
pulse it out where am i up there I
started pulsing we're pulsing a little
late but that is okay you guys I don't
think you understand I was so like dead
I don't know how people talk while
they're doing fitness videos and I might
be annoying to guys but at least I this
video will go by quickly if we're having
a combo so keep pulsing it out yep pulse
it out pulls it out and you know what's
coming next right it's the fire hydrants
so get ready to do fire hydrants we're
just gonna kick our leg out like a dog
that's peeing on a fire hydrant and you
guys make sure that it is mainly your
lower body working I do notice that the
top half of my body kind of moves
slightly while doing this and that's
fine it's just you need to feel it in
your glutes so that is what we're
working this is definitely working the
side booty so when you look to the side
of you and your butt looks nice and big
this is what that is doing so this is so
great for that and it definitely tires
out your leg but again try to be hip
legs and we are not going pulse because
it's fire hydrant shows about today
we're gonna post but try to maintain the
hip length because if you guys don't
only get a few inches off the ground at
first that's fine but keep trying to
lift that leg higher because I know that
you guys can do it it is hard it is
painful but if it's not hard and painful
you're not getting a workout in so make
sure that you do that it's so important
so keep doing that and pretty soon we
are gonna be onto the lunges which I
think are the killer
lunch time so now we are just doing the
opposite leg obviously again don't let
the knee go over your toes let me know
which is your favorite or least favorite
one of these which one killed you if any
of them killed you I will tell you it is
the lunges I don't know why but lunges
for me especially when we start pulsing
it out it's so freaking hard but also
the one after this is hard too but let
me know what your least favorite
favorite is I don't know but we're about
to start cool okay pulse pulse pulse if
you guys are just watching this video
and not working out pause this video
restart and get on the floor you don't
need any equipment you don't need
anything at all all you need is a carpet
or a yoga mat and you don't even need
shoes you can definitely do this without
shoes so you have no excuses so get on
the floor and start doing those lunges
because these are so painful and if you
are AB girl watching this and you have a
boyfriend Helen to do this because
seriously guys don't ever work their
boots and it's so hard for them to do it
it's actually kind of funny so now we
are doing these side ones again and this
definitely tightens my core while I'm
doing it because it does require balance
so if you do feel that you're working it
in your abs it's because you are you're
mainly working your glutes but your abs
still get worked because of the balance
part of this but if that is too hard you
can lay down on your side and just lift
one leg up that's totally fine anything
just listen to your body that is the
most important part of working out is
just listening to your body and we are
about to post so you're gonna pulse it
out yep there it goes I know it's hard
you guys can see my face in this video I
was so out of breath and I felt like I
was dying and I don't know why because I
did this workout a lot but seriously
guys it has helped so much chicks from
before-and-after pictures and do this
video every single day it's only ten
minutes long I know that you guys can do
it
every single day I know you can so yeah
you guys should definitely do it and you
will see your butt strips so much better
and our time for bridges so come on keep
pulsing or keep doing those bridges
thrust in the air
these are one of my favorites to do it
just is so painful once you start
pinching your cheeks and doing it for a
long time I think the best way to work
out is through repetition and through
intention petition until you really
can't feel like you can't do it anymore
so if you want replay this video two
times three times for a whole 30 minute
workout if you guys want to do it but
now we are gonna start pulsing so pulse
pulse pulse this is what kills these are
my favorites to do though I absolutely
love bridges I think that they are so so
effective and they work your glutes like
crazy so I was checking my timer to see
when it was done because I was just
ready to be done like I'm sure that you
guys are but you're almost done you only
have five seconds lots of the entire
workout oh my goodness you're done whoo
yep there I was breathing sigh of relief
dead all right now we're gonna stretch
so it's so important to stretch so cross
your opposite ankle to your opposite
knee and pull your chest forward so
you're gonna lift up and press your
chest forward this is my favorite glute
stretch ever and if you don't feel it
bring your leg closer to you and then
bring your chest further out and then
you will feel it if not I really don't
know how you don't feel it because it is
such an effective stretch this is my
favorite I do this every time I work out
my legs or my butt and I just hold it
for about 30 seconds or so until I feel
like it's got stretched enough and then
I release and I do it for the opposite
side so once you are done with that that
is it for your workout I really hope you
guys liked it I know that this wasn't
like the best production workout video
because this was my very first one and I
don't really do any workout videos on my
channel but I would love to do more if
you guys like this one definitely is
effective though because I do to do this
work out every single day essentially or
three times a week something like that
but if you guys want to shorten it just
cut it in half make everything 30
seconds instead of a minute
there you have it so I hope that you
guys enjoyed the workout and let me know
what you think that guy's alright so
what did you think of the workout are
you guys like burning are you sweating
like I am I didn't think I would sweat
as much as I'm sweating right now but
yeah it was tough it was definitely
tough if you like this workout please
give it a thumbs up if you're out of
breath like me let me know if you finish
this fully let me know and go you
because this was definitely not easy and
thank you so much for working out with
me I love doing these videos and I
really want to do some more of them so
thanks guys and I hope you guys liked it
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
