I'm filming a hairstyle video so this
one is different than what I normally do
cuz I normally focus on like makeup and
fashion and I'm not really good at like
hair videos so I never really do them
but I just got my hair cut for those of
you guys have been following me for a
while you know that my hair has never
once been this short like it's like a
legit law long bob I think that's what
it is like it's show sure it's
unbelievably short compared to what I
normally have um so I decided to do ten
video or ten videos no I decided to do
ten hairstyles for short hair and all of
these are no heat so just because I
don't really like using heat on my hair
because the whole reason I cut it was
because it was damaged and I'm not
really trying to damage this short hair
because I cannot take off any length of
this so I don't really want to damage it
so I didn't do heat so if you guys are
new to my channel make sure that you
guys subscribe I post new videos every
Tuesday and Friday and I would love for
you guys to subscribe but yeah they're
all super quick super easy I did all of
these hairstyles in about 20 minutes
like all of them so each of them take
only like two minutes to do and there's
no heat so if you guys are in a rush in
the morning and you don't know what to
do
totally do this I decided to find some
hairstyles that I like for my short hair
and hopefully get some joy if you guys
like these let me know in the comments
below and if you guys have any other
hairstyles that you know for short hair
comment below so that everyone else can
see you gotta share the knowledge you
know so yeah hope you guys like this
video and let's get started
so the first hairstyle is a super basic
very simple one it's just half-up
half-down
so i just take the top part of my hair
and I just secure it with an elastic
these are very basic hairstyles but this
one I literally wear every single day I
think it makes it look so much cuter and
you look really edgy with your short
hair so these next ones it's just
changing the part so it's I guess three
hairstyles because you can do three
different parts this one I just flipped
it to one side and that's basically all
I did if you can't tell I really love
the messy look so my hair is just super
messy and I just flipped it to that side
and it gives you a completely different
look the next one you just flip it to
the other side and do the exact same
thing good time call phones blowin up
ringin my doorbell I feel of
one two three one two three one and then
you do the same thing for the middle
part so the changing parts is just kind
of all one hairstyle in itself
this next one is a Dutch braid and it's
actually like a Dutch French braid that
you can wear kind of a headband so you
take your hair to the side then you take
the front part of your hair and you just
French braid I did a Dutch braid so I
did it underneath so it can stick out
more you guys want a tutorial on how to
do that there's a million on YouTube but
you just take from the front take from
the back and continue braiding
after you secure with an elastic I just
took the braid and I made it a little
thicker just because I like that look
and then you take a piece of your hair
from underneath and then you're going to
tie it to the braid this is going to
secure it and just make sure that the
bottom part of the braid doesn't fall
out out everywhere and you just make it
a little thicker and mess up your hair a
little bit and that's how I got this
look so this one's super easy you split
your hair in two starting from the
middle part and then you just take a
section in the middle top of your head
on one side and then you French braid or
Dutch braid it down so again there's a
bunch of tutorials showing you how to do
this and then you just tie it with an
elastic at the bottom and you do this on
both sides and then I thicken it up a
little bit just cuz I like that look way
better and it gives it just more of a
messy cool vibe
gotta get no
this here comes the shame 1 2 3 1 2 3
drink
beat it this next look is like the Miley
Cyrus space bun look it's super easy you
just part your hair in the middle take
apart from the very top section of your
half of your head then you twist it and
you just secure with a bobby pin bobby
pins work a million times better than
hair ties so highly recommend a bobby
pin you can use one or two and you just
do that on both sides of your head
this next one is the same concept as the
space funds except for just one of them
kind of combined with the very first
hairstyle split your hair at the very
top and then you twist it and secure
with a bobby pin and that's literally it
instance you have short hair it's really
easy to look messy and cute and not just
messy
I'm gonna swing
I think when you have a short hair you
can actually pull off pigtails without
looking like a five-year-old so I just
part my hair in the middle take the two
front pieces of my hair take them out
and then secure the rest of my hair with
a elastic and then I loosen it up a
little bit and make it a little more
messy because if it's too structured
you're probably going to look like
really little or immature I don't know
so I just make it a little more messy
and it kind of gives us a cool look
this next one is super basic and super
easy but it's probably my favorite
hairstyle to do just because it takes
literally no time so you just take your
head and hair and put it in a ponytail
and that's all you do but I had to
include it even though it's so so simple
you never know just just how to show you
guys don't open up bring in luck Doble
filo do the this next one is my favorite
and I wear all the time it kind of gives
you like a shorter hair look and you
just take your part of your hair to the
side take your front thicker section of
your hair so you kind of take a lot you
don't want to take just like a strand
you kind of want to give the illusion
that your hair is chopped off like that
and then you take the back of your hair
and the rest of it and you just secure
it in a low ponytail and then you just
let go like really like put together but
still messy I don't know I really love
this look I think it makes me look a lot
older too
this next one is another one of my
favorites you're just going to part your
hair to the side which mine already was
so take it to whichever side you prefer
mess it up a little bit and then take
small sections of hair on the side with
not a lot of hair on it and then you
just bobby pin it in the back and I do
two sections I think that's like the
right amount you could do three and then
I part it in the back but then I put my
hair over the bobby pins so you doesn't
show and it looks like you kind of have
a shaved head
