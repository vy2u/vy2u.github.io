don't let make it in the thumbnail okay
once I've everybody welcome back to my
channel today's video is an exciting one
because it is a sit-down talking about
college video which I love doing so much
if you guys are new to my channel hey
I'm Natalie I am a 21 almost 22 year old
college student who has a lot to just
say about the subject I guess then I
post a lot of fashion like style travel
these College elated videos a lot so if
you guys like this video be sure to
thumbs it up and subscribe follow me on
Instagram if you want to catch up with
my daily life or you can also follow my
vlog channel but now that I have
shamelessly plug to myself enough I just
want to say guys what this video is this
video is a what no one ever told you
about college video I had a lot of
expectations going into college and a
lot of them we're just broken because
you end up learning a lot of things I
feel like that no one tells you or a lot
of things on your own that you just end
up figuring out also this is a collab
with Brittany Lewis here on YouTube and
she's a sweetheart first of all can we
talk about her Instagram it's amazing
that has nothing to do this video but
her Instagram is amazing it she is such
a sweetheart she's gorgeous she is also
doing one of these but no one tells you
about college videos so be sure to check
it out because I know that she will say
so many more things than I do you guys
know the drill I have my handy-dandy
notebook and I want to start sharing
with you guys but no one tells you about
college the first thing is that you have
so much free time I don't think I
realize how much free time you really
have until you like you look back and
you're like holy crap how was I in high
school for eight hours a day like
looking back at that now I am like
appalled that I could sit in a classroom
for eight hours a day and not like want
like pull all my hair out
it's a struggle
need to go to a class that's an hour and
15 minutes long I'm just like oh my gosh
like I just like I can't like one class
a day and I'm like skipping it half the
time not really but sometimes you know
it happens I don't understand how I was
in high school for eight hours a day or
in middle school or elementary school
like most of our lives we were in a
classroom for eight hours a day and then
literally off the first semester of
college like you can't even fathom going
back to that you just have so much more
free time that you don't realize and
yeah I only am in class I mean Gretta
and I am a second semester senior so I
don't really have any credits left I'm
only in nine credits but I only have
class Monday through Thursday and I only
have one class a day so I am done as the
latest at 11:45 which is so early to me
and like the rest of the day I have to
do whatever I want so that's really
really nice the second thing is that not
all majors are the same so I know people
go into college very undecided and they
don't know what they want to do and I
feel like a lot of people they know that
not all majors are the same but a lot of
people think like oh colleges college
like whether I am a bio major whether
I'm an engineering major whether I'm a
business major whether I'm a
communications major like yeah well be
learning different things that
essentially will all be studying on and
we'll all have a lot of work in public
law but the truth is it's not so I don't
want to say that in your classes you're
gonna have a lot of tests or in your
classes you're gonna do a lot of
presentations because I don't know
because I don't know your major they're
all so different in what you do and how
much you have to spend outside of class
on it so for me if you guys don't know I
am in industrial engineering major so I
would say I'm not trying to be one of
those annoying stem people that's like
oh you can't talk to me about studying
because you're not in stem where you're
not in engineering like what do you know
about studying not all majors are the
same like engineering majors have to
study and I'm so much more homework and
then for example business majors or
communications majors or fashion majors
or anything like that and I'm not
putting those other majors down the fact
that they don't have to study time under
they don't have don't have as much
homework does not discredit them by any
means they are still great options to go
into it especially if that is the field
for you so I'm not saying anything bad
about them at all I'm just saying the
truth of the fact is that
many of them don't study as much because
they don't have to anything in the stem
it's just a lot more outside work and a
lot more like studying for very very
rigorous courses you might get annoyed
at your friends that aren't in the same
majors you because they're like to watch
Netflix all day and you're slaving away
at the library trust me it happens I
used to get so annoyed when my roommates
would say that they have to study for a
test and that they're so stressed and
it's literally in two days and they
haven't even opened their textbook yet
and they're like watching Netflix I was
like how can you do that but again I'm
not saying that's just credit any other
majors under study that they are all
different number three is that it's easy
to change your lifestyle and what I mean
is that if you are in a rut somewhere
and you want to change so for example
you want to become more fit or you want
to get in shape and you want to let's
start living a healthy lifestyle it is
not as hard as you might think I just
feel like it's all like you have so much
more free time like I said so if you
want and you have such a set schedule
with your classes on Thursday mornings
if you know that you don't have class
until 10:00 you can wake up at 8:00 and
go to the gym or you can go out and buy
your own groceries because it's not like
your parents are buying your food
anymore you know so you can go and buy
your own food to make healthier choices
it's just a lot easier in that sense I
feel like it's very on you you're very
independent you don't really have ties
to anyone else so if you want to change
you can easily do it also if you for
example are don't want to go part or
don't want a party as much or you want
to start going out more and become more
social there's always people for that
like not everyone in college parties
like you can definitely find people that
are willing to just go out for like one
drink or just go out to the movies or go
out whatever you know with you because
there's people like that or if you want
people to go out with there's definitely
people going out that you can tag along
with it's very an inclusive space I feel
like college like I feel like it's not
as clicky as high school like if you
want to ask something to hang out it's
not as intimidating number four is that
college classes are a lot harder than
high school that is just what I think
again different majors so that's from my
own experience but in all in all in
college no matter your major your
teachers and your professors are going
to expect more from
so there's more than likely going to
lecture to a big group of you and they
don't care as much about you
individually unless you go to their
office hours so if you're struggling
individually you need to go to office
hours and then they will take the time
and work with you but in a classroom
it's not like high school where they're
like okay like let me go around to every
table or every student and make sure
that they know what they're doing or
whatever it's not like that at all they
kind of present the information to you
and if you don't get it then they expect
you to ask them after class hours so
normally your class schedule hours it's
just for them to teach you not really
for you to ask too many questions
some professors obviously allow you to
ask questions but for my experience most
of my classes were just me absorbing
information and taking notes and then
afterwards if I had questions I would go
to their office hours it is all harder
but you will adjust very quickly number
five is that living with roommates that
you see the worst of them so this is not
to be like a negative or anything like
that but roommates are hard because even
if they are your best friends and you
get on get along super well it's
obviously so hostile to live with your
best friends like I feel like I am right
now and we get along great but there are
definitely moments where we have gotten
annoyed with each other where we've
gotten in fights and little just little
fights want anything huge but just
little annoyances like hey you didn't
put the dishes away hey like who left
out their food or why I was like the
lights are on all night you know things
like that let's random little things
like controlling the thermostat or like
mainly cleanliness is my main thing but
you just see a lot of that with people
because you're not used to living with
them and people grew up in our race so
differently and you're all living
separate lives and like sometimes you
might cook and not have time to put
something away and then someone is
annoying because when they have to use a
pan they like don't have one because you
didn't clean it up blah blah blah
whatever random stuff like that you guys
can get in little arguments because you
are with each other so often and you see
every single side to them so it's not
just like you're friends and you're like
let me just go to dinner and then go
back your separate ways like you're
going back home with them and you see
them all the time it's bound to happen
it's kind
like siblings you fight with your
siblings even though you love them just
because you guys are around each other a
lot number sex is that random
responsibilities mature you and what I
mean by this is that when you go to
college for me at least I don't know
about you guys but before college I
didn't buy my own groceries I didn't
really like do my laundry all that often
I have like my mom bought her groceries
my mom like would remind me to bring
down my laundry to do it sometimes my
mom will be like Natalie clean your room
it's disgusting and she would yell at me
if my room wasn't clean making dinner
like I would kind of expect like hey
like what's for dinner tonight like I
might wasn't the one cooking for the
family you know and when you go to
college it's all on you so at least now
I buy both senior year I've gotten it
down and it's not like a big deal to me
anymore but like you don't have food
you're not eating
like you need to go to the grocery store
and go and get your food you can't duel
expect food to magically fill the fridge
in the pantry up it matures you in the
sense of that like afterwards like by
now I'm just like yeah I need to go
grocery shopping whatever it's not like
oh no like do I need to go grocery
shopping like I've gotten it down
already but in the beginning it is like
just a transition into a more adulthood
I guess but no one tells me to clean my
room anymore like my mom is not yelling
at me to clean my room like I get
disgusted if I'm living in a messy room
so I will clean it you know but those
things just much her you little by
little it's not some grand like epiphany
like oh my gosh I'm a new woman like I'm
so mature I like made my bed without
being told like no but I'm just saying
like little things like making dinner
for yourself going to the grocery store
making sure your clothes are clean
everything like that without any person
telling you what to do it does mature
you in the long run number seven is that
you value your family more I mean I call
my mom walking back from class every
single day and I'm just like hey what
are you doing okay cool
yeah I had toast for breakfast I don't
care about nothing at all on the phone
but I just missed my mom so I call her
you know we just chat about life and
like in high school I would never do
that because I lived with her obviously
you know I got you you gave me a little
more I was just
vacation with my family obviously and I
really it was dreading coming back to
the school like I just love being with
them I love spending time with them and
it was just really nice so you
definitely value them a lot more as you
get older and we're eight as I can get
very very stressful again you're kind of
isolated you're very independent even if
you have friends nothing is the same as
having like your mom to cry to I guess
so
I feel like it's just very overwhelming
because you can't share everything with
your friends like it's very like a lot
of it is on you so if you don't like any
of your classes if you don't like your
professors if you failed your tests like
that's not really stuff that like
friends always talk about I guess so
I there have been plenty of times that I
have literally been like sobbing in my
bed thinking like what am i doing like I
don't I don't like my major I don't like
these classes I just failed to come out
smart enough I'm not good enough to do
this you know like I just want to drop
out like there were definitely many
moments like that it can get very very
stressful College is so fun and it's
such a great time but the reality is
it's a lot of pressure and it's a lot of
stress because especially you're kind of
doing everything on your own
it's definitely a more isolated and
lonely feeling like a lot of people deal
with a lot of like anxiety depression
and everything that comes out in college
and it never surfaced in high school but
um yeah it's a real thing it's really
really can be a lonely place
number nine is that nightlife is not for
everyone so I know when I first came to
college I thought college parties were
gonna be the biggest thing everyone goes
out on the weekends and that is true
everyone does go out on the weekends
what should say everyone but there's
always people going out on the weekends
or any day of the week really I
personally am NOT a nightlife person my
roommates literally every weekend
they're like are you gonna come out with
us
no I just don't like going out and
that's totally fine no one who cares if
I don't like going out no one forces me
and I have my friends that I can show
life and not go out with or my boyfriend
or anything like that looking really
nightlife is not for everyone I honestly
cannot tell you the last time I went
as far as in Raleigh I love my me time I
love legging in bed and I love editing
videos and then I'm watching like
Netflix and all that stuff so if you
feel like you're scared of college
because you feel like everyone goes out
and you don't want to don't worry you
don't have to but if you also want to
there's a brochure a giant giving people
that do the last one it does a dating
dynamic is different and I don't really
know how to describe it I feel like
without parental supervision anything is
different because again you don't have a
curt view you don't have someone telling
you that you can or cannot hang out with
this person or anything like that so
it's a lot of your own judgment and you
have to make sure your judgment is sound
it is like good in college hookup
culture is so prominent so many people
just hook up a bunch of people and like
they a lot of less people are in
relationships too and you have such a
larger pool to choose from of guys and
girls like in high school I feel like
it's who you grew up with it's back to
MU J so you end up dating like everyone
like dates each other kind of thing and
in college you just have such a giant
group of people that in a sense could be
harder to meet people but also it's
easier because you can really weed out
the ones that you like by based on my
interests and stuff like that I just
know that baby dynamic in college is so
so so different anyways I hope that you
