I am coming to you guys with a brand new
video and it is about how to start a
YouTube channel so this video I feel
like is a very requested because a lot
of people ask just how did you get
started like how did you gain
subscribers how did you get people to
view your videos these are all such
common questions that I don't only get
on like comments but I get in person
just honestly by like friends and people
I know that find out I do YouTube and
they see that I have like almost 40,000
subscribers a lot of people will ask
like how did you get that many I'm not
saying that it's a lot but I do think
that it is definitely something that I
am proud of I'm just going to tell you
guys and dive right in about how to
start a youtube channel and if this is
your first time hi please be sure to
subscribe and thumbs this video up
because that is a tip on how to get
people to find you so I have written
down ten topics that I want to cover
some of them I'm gonna really talk about
others I'm not going to discuss too much
about that the first one is your channel
name this one I feel like gets kind of
brushed off a lot because people don't
really think about that but I think it's
a little bit important so I started out
with beauty by neck so that's actually
my email for my youtube channel and that
is just like what I started out on
YouTube as for such a long time until I
finally changed it to just my name um
this one's kind of tough because back
when I started that was a thing like
everyone was had like one of those like
weird not weird but like kind of like
usernames so I feel like that's gonna
like how it was on YouTube back then but
honestly I kind of like having something
that says what your channel is about and
then you can transition into just having
your name like it's not really a big
deal if you change your name I would
make your email just your normal email
but for you the name of your channel I
think that if you have something that
describes what you do like makeup by
whatever people will know that you do
makeup videos that's why I honestly
personally recommend coming up with
something like that in the beginning and
then once you get more subscribers and
they get to know you a little bit
then changing it to your first name it's
not hard at all you just go into your
settings and you change it so that's
what I would do personally just because
I think in the beginning it will help
people find you I had beauty by not for
such a long time and people knew that I
did beauty videos by that so I
definitely would recommend doing
something like that I may be a little
creative or maybe something that
incorporates your name in it and then
once you feel more comfortable you can
change it to your actual name but that
is just my opinion on that because I
feel like I've never heard anyone really
say that before so yeah I wanted to dive
and do that topic so the next topic is
about content this one is obviously a
huge one because people who might want
to start on YouTube and not know how to
create their content well for what I
think about this is kind of tricky
because if you're just wanting to start
on YouTube but you have no idea what you
want to start I feel like it's more like
you're starting on it to become famous
so that's why it's like I feel like your
content should just honestly be natural
to you and it should feel comfortable
but then again there are some people who
want to practice like making just videos
in general because they're obsessed like
they like film and they like editing and
just like videography in general and
then they don't know what their contents
should be on so that's different content
should be what you want to watch I think
that is the bottom line what it should
be like so if you don't want to watch
makeup tutorials but you think that if
you did makeup tutorials you'd be famous
I really don't think you should do
makeup tutorials I think that you guys
should do the topics that you want to
watch so what are your most searched
videos and what is the thing that you're
most drawn to are you most drawn to like
BuzzFeed type videos are you more drawn
to look books or are you more drawn to
comedy things like that that is what you
should do so whatever you watch the most
on YouTube I think those that is the
easiest content for you to do because
you know exactly what you're doing so
you know the videos that you like to
watch you know you have inspiration
already and there's nothing wrong with
getting inspired by youtubers there's a
difference if you straight-up copy them
but like everything on YouTube is kind
of just another copy of another thing
like I'm not the first person to do how
to do a successful YouTube channel I'm
just I'm not and I'm not gonna lie and
say that I am but it is something that I
enjoy watching and I wanted to put my
own spin on it so that
I'm making this video if that makes
sense so yeah makeup tutorials very
common millions of videos on the
internet on that but I'm putting my own
spin on it or so I think I'd like to
think that so that's why I'm making the
video for you guys the next one is
scheduled so this is something I think a
lot of people don't talk about either I
just started a schedule on YouTube so
now I post Tuesdays and Fridays but this
week secret I'm posting like exciting
video on Wednesday too so there will be
three videos this week
sidenote it's kind of like a little
plugin for me but first schedule I would
really really look sit down at your
schedule we're during the school year
right now so a lot of people are busy
Monday to Friday so sit down look at
when it's actually physically possible
for you to film because I think that if
you don't plan ahead of time when you're
gonna film you're just gonna brush it
off it's kind of like going to the gym
like how many people say like oh I'll
start going to the gym next week I'll
start next week but you don't really
have a plan when to start no you have to
put it in your schedule put when you're
gonna edit put when you're gonna come up
with ideas put when you're going to film
and ask people to help film you if they
can those days or whatever if you need
someone else to help you film if not
like you can just be in front of a
tripod like I am but you know you have
to plan it and I think that's what's
most important now that I have a
planning schedule right now it's Monday
and I'm uploading the city on Tuesday I
knew that in my break first my classes I
had to sit down and film this video
because the video is coming up tomorrow
I had that in my schedule so like if
someone I was gonna hang out right now I
wouldn't be able to because I had this
in my schedule so that's just what you
guys have to do you just have to put it
in your schedule get in the beginning
you're probably not gonna have a
schedule and you're just gonna be kind
of random doing whatever you want and
that's fine but eventually you will
start developing into one whether you
plan it or not but I think planning it
is best because it just helps you stay
organized
number four is social media so a lot of
people don't talk about this either
while using well talk about YouTube
because YouTube in itself it's like kind
of different from you Instagram and
Twitter and all that but for me I think
that you guys should find a social media
that you guys like the best you don't
need to be active on all three or all
three all of them however many there are
you don't need to be active on every
single one but you should be active on
at least one because people want to know
you that's what I realized whenever I
find a youtuber that I like I look up
their Instagram and I follow them on
their Instagram is definitely my thing I
love posting on Instagram just pictures
I
like pictures that I took anything like
that and that's where I also like talked
to you guys and you guys get to know me
there that is like my personal that
YouTube is my thing where I make videos
that I love and I put them out there for
you and yeah you guys get to know me but
Instagram is when I'm not planning
sitting down making a YouTube video
filming editing like all this stuff it's
just a different aspect of me this is
like my YouTube me and Instagram I have
like more personal life pictures like
you're not gonna see that much of my
friends and family on my youtube just
because I don't film them that often but
on my Instagram you will see a lot of my
personal like life on there so I would
definitely utilize social media so much
because your viewers are gonna want to
get to know you and you want your
viewers to get to know you that is why
they come back that is why they like you
I don't watch youtubers because I just
enjoy their content i watch them because
i genuinely like we're friends like I
feel like we are friends if that makes
sense I don't know if you I mean I feel
like anyone watching this video can
understand that like if you aren't part
of the YouTube community you like it
because you can relate to the people
behind the camera they're not just like
celebrities you actually feel like you
know them and so that is why social
media is so important I think that if
you utilize that when you're starting
your followers were really get to know
you from the beginning and that's so so
important and that's how you develop a
fanbase and that's how you develop like
people that actually come back to your
videos and have like retention you don't
just have like people that watch one
video and never again the next one I
want to discuss is collabs and collabs
are great there's such a great way to
bring in new followers so and they're
honestly such a great way to make new
friends so once you become a youtuber
guys you will understand there's a lot
of things that everyone else doesn't
understand and personally I think that
YouTube is like everything like I think
everyone knows what YouTube is and
everyone like goes on you like YouTube
is my world I am in this youtube bubble
but a lot of people have literally no
idea what I do no idea why I like it
they think it's so weird that I talk to
a camera like they think it's weird that
I spend money on like editing software
or people think it's weird people don't
know about it yet like if they know what
YouTube is but they don't think that
people actually like do YouTube if that
makes sense so more people than you
think really have no idea obviously if
you're watching my videos and you
probably have an idea of like oh yeah
like YouTube like everyone watches that
no everyone does
watch it that is like collabs are really
important because you make so many great
friends one of my best friends Jeff I
just went to visit her in LA if you guys
want to watch that vlog I will have that
down below but yeah so I was with her in
a lion I met her through the internet
like I met her on YouTube she just
deemed me and then we started talking
now we're like best friends just because
of that because we collab together it's
such a great way to meet people and you
can like make such great connections and
her subscribers have come to me my
subscribers go to her it's just it's not
only for subscribers it's but it's
genuinely a way to enjoy yourself more
on the internet because people are gonna
make fun of you I hate to say it but
like they will people are not really
gonna understand it we're gonna make fun
of you people are gonna think you're
wasting your time there's a bunch of
things that people are gonna think and
like it's just cuz they don't understand
like I don't think there really have
that bad of intentions but they just
really really don't understand
so that is why making Cola or having
collabs and collab and the people that
do what you do is so important and I
think that it's just gonna make your
time as a youtuber way more like just
you're gonna enjoy yourself more and
their subscribers will come to you and
yours will come to them so that is why
it's exciting next thing I want to talk
about is utilizing Google Analytics so a
lot of people don't know what Google
Analytics is and it basically tells me
everything about you guys so don't worry
you guys are anonymous like I can't look
up like what username is where but it
tells me your demographics that tells me
what device you use your what device you
watch my videos on it tells me the my
retention rate it tells me what software
like if you're on Google Chrome or
you're using Safari or Firefox like I
can see that isn't that creepy
everything you guys do not who does it
but the percentage of people that do
what so that's really creepy and I can
see like the exact city like I have so
many people from my hometown in North
Carolina that watch my videos and it's
like a really small place so I know it's
hiegel from my high school and I'm like
oh wow that's like a lot like honestly a
lot of people from my high school watch
this so you guys are from my high school
hi guys I like totally know that you
guys watch this but yeah so utilizing
Google Analytics is great because I can
see just what people are interested in
so I see like if a lot of people are
from California for example I know that
my look books should be more pertaining
to that whether you don't like
I can kind of engage with you guys
through that and like know what you guys
are gonna want to see through that or if
I see that a lot of people are using
their iPhone instead of their laptop
instead of having annotations because
people can't click on annotations on
their phone
I'll have cards so they can like click
on it on their phone - because cards
show up on your phone so I can look at
Tom Horner or whatever so I would do
that in sense so it's just a great way
to actually be smart about it and I can
just like customize my videos more
towards my subscribers just by utilizing
Google Analytics and I think that is
something that goes so like over
people's head like people don't think
about that at all but it is something
that if you want to take you to more
seriously you have to think about just
because you just want to be smarter with
it and if you can't if you have the
resources why wouldn't you use them the
next one is to engage with your
subscribers so I kind of touched on this
with social media but complete like
comment back on your subscribers videos
message them if they email you things
like that like I always try doing that
I'm not that big so I don't have really
constant like comments coming and
constant emails or whatever but when I
can I'll make time in my day to sit down
and reply to you guys because I know
that that makes you guys like like
you're not talking to a wall you're not
talking to a computer you are talking to
a real person so it kind of just makes
honestly you weren't likable and why
wouldn't you want to I just don't
understand when people don't want to
respond to them like someone is talking
to you don't ignore them I don't know
don't purposely go out of your way and
ignore them I think commenting back is
something that is so taken for granted
and like people don't realize that an
actual person is commenting on your
video like took the time to comment on
your video that being said I don't
respond to every single comment if it's
been like a really old video or
something like that and I am guilty of
that my card died and I don't really
know like what I was saying but
basically comment back to your
subscribers like the whole thing people
will like you more and honestly you
would just be a better person if you
commented back because they're going out
of their way to talk to you so you
shouldn't ignore them the next thing I
want to talk about is equipment and this
is kind of like a scary topic to come
into because it involves money and no no
one really likes to talk about money and
how much you should spend and everyone
always says like you don't need anything
like just start with what you have and I
hate to say it but like I'm gonna kind
of repeat that so
honestly if you have an iPhone if you
don't have an iPhone and you have like
an Android or anything any smartphone I
would say a smartphone it's like the
base of what you should be starting with
so honestly the iPhone camera is amazing
it's so good especially the newer models
and if you're getting the iPhone 7 which
is coming out that camera is like shoots
in 4k and it's so good anything else I
would really just go to Best Buy tell
them what you're looking forward to tell
them your price point and they will help
you find a camera good for you the thing
is that a lot of cameras are really
expensive camera and prices have gone up
tremendously you also have to pay for a
lens people want to pay for like mics
lights like whatever right now I'm using
a microphone and I have some studio
lights and I have a tripod and I have a
camera and I have the lens that came
with but my camera is like a really good
camera it's the Canon 70d which cost a
pretty penny so as you grow I think then
you should start spending more money but
in the beginning your iPhone is fine
like what if you don't like it and you
just spent $2,000 on a camera you know
so in the beginning use your a
smartphone borrow someone's like I'm
sure people around you will have one to
let you borrow for like an hour or test
out a camera if you go to school like if
you're a part of a university a lot of
campuses will let you rent their film
equipment actually I know that's where I
go I go to NC State you can rent a whole
video kit comes with a camera lens
lights I'm pretty sure mic like it comes
with a ton of stuff you can rent it for
free so definitely try looking up that's
to cut type of stuff but if you want it
just for yourself using your iPhone to
start is such a great way and then you
can just edit it on iMovie do not spend
money on final cut until you are
comfortable with iMovie there is
literally no reason for you to spend
money on final cut and like I used
iMovie for like forever until this year
I think I used I'm diseased so I'm a
works totally fine and then once you're
more comfortable with it and you think
that you need something more advanced
then I would step it up but like you
don't want to spend money on something
that you don't know if you're gonna love
ya if you don't know that you're gonna
keep doing it like you want to be smart
about it so just take it day by day
video by video and then kind of see what
you need more of but I think the first
thing that you should invest in is
probably a better camera but besides
that like just take it day by day the
next one this video is so long but then
I
stolen is for time and balance this
kinda went into my scheduling thing but
you have to balance it which just means
that you have to put it on your schedule
and you have to kind of see like make it
a priority even if you don't think it is
one I don't want to dive too much into
this because I already talked out I was
scheduling but basically my only tip to
have for time and balance is to write it
down plan it out and put it on your
schedule even if you're not a planner
with something like this like you really
do have to plan last one is something
that's so so so so important and it's
gonna make your time on YouTube way more
enjoyable and I mean it should be
enjoyable like I freaking love doing
YouTube videos like I love it but it's
just gonna make it like way better so be
yourself this is such a cliche and
you've heard this so many times but
honestly please don't start YouTube to
make money don't start it to become
famous do it because you actually love
it I freaking love making videos like
Salem is such a passion I might like not
feel but like making videos like this
it's like I I love it I love it so much
and I love my subscribers so much so
mwah thank you kisses to you oh yeah I
just like I really really love I cannot
imagine my life without it I really
can't I did not start this to become
famous and I'm not famous but I didn't
start it to become famous and it's just
been like when people ask me what I love
to do I say YouTube videos and then I
kind of get like a company you stare but
like it's a good icebreaker I guess but
yeah so do it be yourself and also
reflect on it like if all of a sudden if
you started out kind of being yourself
and then all of a sudden you realize
that you're not making videos that you
love anymore and you're doing things
just because they're popular you can
really want to have time to reflect back
on that I think reflection is such an
important part of just being successful
in anything like in your life in general
you really want to make sure that you're
staying true to who you are stay true to
what you believe in um don't do things
because everyone else is doing them stay
in school don't do drugs whatever
doesn't know today in the video you tube
but I felt like it was like it just kind
of like had to be said look I feel like
a mom like preaching to her children
going off to high school but basically
just be yourself with it because people
will be able to tell if you're not and
eventually they will and you also don't
want it like if you start doing it just
for the money or you start doing
just for fame you're really not gonna
enjoy it you really aren't and why would
you do something that you don't enjoy so
that is my final tip for you guys this
video is really long and I hope that you
guys enjoyed it make sure to subscribe
because I post videos every Tuesday and
Friday except for last week I didn't
post on Tuesday because it was just it
was a bad week you guys so I'm human I'm
