coming to you guys with a video on how
to save slush make money when you aren't
in college now it's about the time of
year when I'm kind of looking at my bank
account and I'm like hmm
umm what's like how do I have no money
where did my money go and how the heck
am I going to actually make money
because I'm not just gonna stop my
living and like never have to pay for a
single thing again college is so hard to
save money because like your full-time
student and I feel like a lot of people
don't have jobs in college because they
want to focus on their studies anyways I
just know that the college struggle I am
at college student a junior in college
if you guys don't know hi if you're new
here be sure to subscribe I post videos
every Tuesday and Friday and I just kind
of want to get into the video and tell
you guys how to save money first way to
save money is actually an app that I
found its called ibotta
and I want to first give them a shout
out and say thank you for partnering
with me on this video I don't like to
hide my sponsored videos and I don't do
a lot of them but I absolutely love this
app and I have saved actually a lot of
money on it so I will leave the link
down below but I just didn't want it to
be a secret that I am partnering with
them on this video how the app works
just let you go to all of your most
common stores CVS Target of Charlotte
Russe is on there there's a lot of
retail stores on there Aldo which I know
like I buy like a ton of shoes from
there so you go to all your most common
stores honestly just live your life buy
your stuff and then you get money back
there's a ton of different products that
you gotta has and then every time you
buy that product you just scan your
receipt and you scan the item and you
get like a dollar back 50 cents back
five dollars back it just depends on how
much it was so it's basically a reverse
coupon is the way I view it so you buy
something but then you get some money
back so I think that's under my knee I
actually just went since CVS today and I
got some stuff and I don't have to scan
about it and get my money back because I
think that is so freaking smart and it
goes straight to your bank account it's
not one of those things where it's like
if you scan five things you'll get a $25
Starbucks gift card yeah those are nice
but it's actually just straight up cash
into your bank account so there's no
strings or anything and actually the
very first time that you use Avada you
get $10 like
that's literally just walking down the
street finding $10 picking it up and
putting it in your pocket
you guys are college students high
school students anyone like literally
download this app and use it once and
get 10 bucks just like that last week do
you know how much money I had in my
checking account
take a guess just pick a wild guess 25
cents I didn't even have a dollar I had
25 cents to my name also awesome about
this app though is that it's integrated
with other ones so like you can use
group on with it and get money back from
even group on which Groupon already
saves you money but then you can get
money back even from using Groupon so
it's like really cool it's integrated
with a bunch of other apps you can use
that on just your basic storage dealer
spending your normal money but you're
making money too I mean I just click
can't stress how much I love it enough
not because I sponsored with them I
promise you like you literally any one
of you guys can get $10 the numbers too
way to save money is my student discount
these are very obvious I feel like
everyone knows about student discount
but I'm trying to make you guys have a
more practical ways to save money I
really really really hate life hacks
that are like if you like sniffing
orange and drink two water bottles in an
hour you might get better grades and you
also will I don't know just like all
these weird things or like if you tape
something to your finger without do some
I don't know just like weird life hacks
I'm not really into those because
literally no one's gonna use them it's
just like student discounts there are a
list of places that have student
discounts literally ask anywhere you go
movie theaters and your college campuses
normally have a student discounts on a
certain day restaurants almost like all
fast-food places have student discount
so you don't know about and it's just
like a free drink but like come on who
doesn't want a free drink so like I know
Chipotle does it you know but does it
McDonald's has student discounts Burger
King Waffle House um a chick-fil-a
like all of these places have students
discounts Banana Republic j.crew a ton
of stores like they made well I'm pretty
sure make sure that you guys ask
everywhere you go the grocery store near
me is called Harris Teeter if you're a
student you get 10% off every single
purchase so that it's an automatic 10%
off you don't
need to keep showing up your student ID
you register your account like you're
sick your reward card and you
automatically get 10% off every single
time number 3 is discounted textbooks
which I feel like everyone knows about
everyone talks about never buy your
textbooks full price you should never
buy your textbooks a full price
it's the biggest waste of money ever
there's so many accounts like Chegg I
think it's called like techy textbook
there's so many different websites I'll
have a couple of them linked down below
for you guys that you can buy discounted
textbooks Amazon Prime free for students
you can get books on there to do highly
recommend rec renting them because most
classes you will not need the textbook
again and you're just gonna have it
sitting there but if you do buy it you
can actually resell it so resell it on
Amazon resell it on tag like resell on
all of these different websites most
universities have a drop-off where you
can resell it actually at your
university but you don't make as much
money there but you can resell them so
yeah just resell your textbooks because
what are you gonna do with a random like
calculus textbooks from two years ago
number four is another website that I
found it's called laser comm and I
actually use this when I go grocery
shopping so if you type in your grocery
list or just type in everything that you
are planning on buying it will give you
coupons for it just for like anywhere so
I actually use that a lot grocery
shopping I just put like milk eggs bread
whatever typical grocery store things
and then I'll put whatever else I'm
buying and you might get like a dollar
here and there two dollars off I'm
telling you guys that might not seem
like a lot but in college every single
dollar counts every single 50 cents
counts every single 25 cents counts if
you're me so that is an awesome website
I thought it was so cool I had no idea
about it before someone told me but yeah
you just get a literally scammed
everything and just gives you coupons
like why would you guys not do that I
just don't understand like all these
things why would someone choose not to
do it number 5 is something that I did
last year and I actually made over 50
bucks doing this and was only a one day
thing there was an email sent out to us
about experiments and someone needed a
volunteer to help with a like see me
like a simulation driving experiment you
just have to go to a lab for like two
hours I literally sat there and played
like one of those video games where
you're driving a car and I got paid over
50 bucks just because students and like
grad students they
people with further research so they
need people for their experiments or
their studies that they're doing and so
I did that for it was like 20 dollars an
hour 25 dollars an hour they paid me
just to do that so and I just signed up
right away I was like I'll do it no one
knows about that but if you just look up
like research experiments at whatever
university you are and sign up as a
volunteer you will make so much money
they actually pay really really well and
it's literally the easiest thing ever
you're just sitting there doing what
they tell you to do it's never really
dangerous or anything like that like
that was literally driving a video game
car so yeah
highly recommend doing that number six
is also something that I do and it is
ways to save baking so if you guys are
with Wells Fargo which I know I am or
Bank of America probably just something
like this BB&amp;amp;T I don't know all the
little like banks probably do stuff like
this too but what I do is I have a ways
to save banking account so basically
every single time I make purchase on my
checking account one dollar goes to my
savings account so like every single
purchase transfers a dollar to my
savings account you will save so much
money by the end of the year it's
actually kind of crazy I think I've
saved like 200 something dollars just by
any little purchase like it will
transfer a dollar which to you and
doesn't seem like a lot but like in the
end it will and it's just nice to know
that every time you're actually spending
money like at least you're saving some
it's kind of like having a jar full of
extra change or cash but if you're like
me you literally never carry cash with
you I never have cash on me ever so like
a job like a jar for me like wouldn't do
anything so I would never put anything
in there so that's awesome so talk to
your bank again like not sponsored by my
bank but yeah talk to your bank and do
the ways to save it's for college
students but I'm pretty sure like anyone
can do it and it's such a great way to
save I've been doing it for years and
I've saved so much money
number seven is a way to save money and
make money and it is to either become a
tutor or you can save money by getting
tutored so becoming a tutor I'm pretty
sure every single school has a tutorial
Center they work with your schedule
because they know obviously you're a
student and you're a student that makes
good grades that you care about your
grades that's why you're a tutor so if
you do that they actually pay really
well I know a couple people that do it I
think you just have
take a look an orientation and a class
and then you become a tutor super easy
if you're good at a subject obviously
don't do it for something that you're
not good at but if you're really good at
a subject and it wants to make extra
money become a tutor they work with your
schedule it's literally at your school
they need tutors like I always get
emails like anyone interested in
becoming a tutor so seriously to do that
and a way to save money is instead of
getting a professional tutor which I
actually did one year without knowing
about my tutorial center at school um I
actually like paid money for one but
instead of doing that there's so many
like resources at your school you do not
need to spend money on a tutor go to the
shores and get tutored and get that a
yeah number eight is another way to save
money and of course this is another like
practical Khmer the obvious one but do
not waste your money on a doctor that
sounds kind of weird but I know again
freshman year I would go to like the
MinuteClinic or I'd go to actually a
doctor's office whenever I was sick and
then I realized wait literally like
there is student health at my school
that is a legit doctor's office so don't
waste your money on going to your doctor
at home anymore go to the one at school
I'm pretty sure insurance is covered in
your tuition if you don't have insurance
or I'm not sure about the logistics of
that but yeah it's free so definitely go
there and said never nine is free gym
classes so this is another way to save
money and again this is not a crazy life
hats like things that you've never
thought of in your life no this is
practical like hey reminding you save
your money instead of paying eight
dollars for a walk in yoga class down
the street why don't you just go to your
gym they literally have so many options
for classes I know
ours has yoga we have like studio or we
have a like dancin dance classes we have
cycling we have running like literally
with everything don't spend money on a
gym and now you don't have any reason
not to workout because yeah life hack
workout it's free then that is a way to
save money and this one is also another
obvious one but is to get either like a
job on campus or something that you can
do oh my gosh there's so much noise
outside
my window is not open and you can
probably hear everything it is so
annoying so I just get a job on campus I
know for us we have actually a career
portal so you can look up jobs on campus
all online and you can look up actually
jobs around the area from you all online
that are hiring NC State students or for
me it's a sea snakes I go to NC State
hiring students at your school so
definitely be sure to do that and again
if you they know that you are a student
they are recruiting students they know
you have classes it is so flexible or
you can do babysitting I know for me I
did babysitting freshman year it was
such an easy way to make money and they
of course know you're a student they go
by your schedule - or hello start a blog
started YouTube I highly encourage
everyone that has any sort of interests
like slim interest in doing it to do it
you do make money but honestly it's like
the most fun thing ever and you're not
gonna make money in the beginning so it
might take you a while but it is so much
fun oh yeah I have videos and like how
to start a YouTube channel and stuff
like that but I think that this is like
I'm I don't know where I would be
without YouTube and like it's a perk
that it makes me money but yeah I
seriously love it so much like this the
reason I don't want to do anything else
is because I want to focus all my time I
meet you
like yeah I could have a job but like I
don't want to because I know I wouldn't
be able to focus all my time on YouTube
like you guys I post twice a week that's
a lot for being a college student I mean
I like really really focus on you know
you guys like this if you guys want any
other college videos or any other videos
