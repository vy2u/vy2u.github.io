filming a 10 things I wish I knew before
college video and this is just something
that I kind of came up with on my own
I've seen these before I went into
college and they actually really helped
me so I'm hoping that they will help you
guys just as much as they helped me
because I just went through my first
year of college so I'm not saying I've
gone through it all and I'll probably
make another one after 10 things I
learned after my sophomore year cuz I'm
sure a lot will change but for now I
just have ten things that I learned my
freshman year of college and yeah I
didn't know these before going into
college and I think they'll help a lot
of you because I think the college
expectation versus reality it's totally
different so yeah I hope this helped you
guys and I'm filming outside today cuz
it's like 6:30 and it's not hot at all
and I'm just kind of enjoying the
weather actually I said this is ten
things but it's actually 15 things I
learned or I wish I knew before college
ten things I learned in college I wish I
knew before college whichever you want
but I'm actually give you guys five
bonus ones so so the very first one is
going to be kind of a boring one but
it's definitely definitely a necessity
especially if you actually want to pass
college and not waste your money or your
parents money and it is study of many
nights before and high school I did not
study and if I did it was the night
before a test and that was basically it
and I got an A and on in the class you
know so high school is pretty easy for
me I took a lot of AP classes and even
like that it really wasn't bad but
basically me and my friend were talking
about this and you should study as much
for a test like any test in college as
you do for AP exams or just finals in
high school because and you learn so
much in such a short period of time so
there's not really any review and then
you might think like oh well I don't
really admit like you don't even
remember what you learned at first so
like it's really good to just study it
multiple nights before because if you
have any questions you can definitely go
to your teacher's office hours or
something but yeah like don't think that
this is high school
you really got to study multiple nights
before and people always told me that
and I was like yeah right like they
probably did that in high school
no you need to do it in college the
second thing is rent your books so I
cannot tell you how many people just
bought their book off of the bookstore
at your school because it's like oh
here's all your books we have it in a
package already like you can still buy
it's only three hundred four hundred
dollars so cheap guys no please buy your
books off of check I bought a book or
rent your books off track I my physics
textbook was about this thick and about
$200 to buy at my bookstore and just
like even to rent it like I couldn't
even rent it I had to buy it and on
cheque I got it for $30 you guys we will
save hundreds of dollars if you do it
off the Chad comm I don't know any other
websites all I'm uses Chad but seriously
do not buy your books if anything read
them from your bookstore but seriously
do not buy your books it's such a waste
money number three
you won't make as many friends as you
think you will and that one's kind of a
downer so I didn't know if I should
include it or not but I decided to
because when I went into college I
thought that I was going to make so many
friends and like everyone's gonna love
me and like I was gonna love everyone
and like I'm just to have like 50 close
friends and we're all gonna visit each
other in the summer and Stephanie's be
so awesome and that's not the case I did
make a lot of new friends but not as
many as I thought so in the beginning
and it is my fault and I will get to it
and other ones but I don't know I just
thought I was gonna make so many friends
and like I made friends with my sweet
and it's me plus three other girls and
we're like best friends but then I kind
of didn't make any other Fresca's like
it's still kind of clicky I guess like
you still have your cliques like no like
it's more open than high school but
you're still gonna have your cliques and
like I know I just felt like I wasn't
involved as many things that I need meet
as many people as I definitely could
have so that one was my fault you might
make a lot of friends but for me I
didn't make that many friends as many as
I thought like I have more high school
friends than I do college friends
and yeah I will get more on how to make
more friends into other ones that things
I wish I knew before college but yeah I
would say definitely make try to make as
many friends or you won't make as many
friends as you think unless of course
maybe you're lucky that was just my
experience and this is just personal to
me everyone's gonna have their own
college experience but for me I wish I
made I wish I knew that I wasn't gonna
make as many friends as I could on which
brings me to number four is you need to
get involved in the very beginning of
school which is like first two or three
weeks I heard something today at my
church actually which was kind of ironic
because I'm filming this video today and
I had no idea that they were gonna say
this but that you meet the people that
you meet in your first three weeks other
people that are gonna make you the
biggest impact on you in your college
experience which means that they are
going to shape who you are they're going
to be your best friends they're gonna be
your enemies I don't know but yeah so
your first three weeks are absolutely
crucial in college and you need to join
as many things as you can if you don't
want to rush you really don't have to
I don't think priests like this for
everyone and you want me to do a whole
Greek life video definitely thumbs this
video up because I feel like on YouTube
literally everyone says rush rush rush
like you have to rush and I honestly
don't think so so if you want me to do
my take on Greek life then definitely
thumbs this video up and let me know but
yeah I don't think that you have to but
anyways join clubs so if you want a rush
or if you're thinking about it then
definitely do but if you don't want to
totally fine like you definitely don't
have to and join it clubs you guys I
wish I got involved in way more clubs in
the beginning I kind of started getting
involved second semester and when
everyone already made their friendships
so please like join it clubs that you
think that you're interested in should
write your name on their email as
there's Blamey something at your college
it's gonna be like a club there or
something either at orientation or just
add in the beginning the first week
school there's so many clubs set up
everywhere all over campus on your walk
to class on your watch in your dorm to
join at clubs
it's so so so important to meet those
people in the first three weeks because
that is how will how you will make my
third thing like you will make as many
friends untrue because then you'll be
joining way more clubs than I did
number five is change your schedule
until it's absolutely perfect my
favorite part about college honestly is
the fact that we get to choose our
schedule
so many times in high school I hated my
schedule but there was nothing I can do
about it and it's on in college like you
can totally change it you can change you
can asset side if you want morning
classes and night classes no Friday
classes no Monday classes whatever you
decide and my school we got cremate
schedules at orientation and mine
absolutely sucked and like at
orientation we got to change it if we
wanted to and all the classes are cold
like nothing was available and I was so
so sad I was like oh my god I'm stuck
with night classes oh my gosh I'm stuck
night class isn't stuck with like bad
teachers I have too many gaps I have
Friday's blah blah like I'm so upset and
like then I I kid you not I went back to
check my classes maybe five times a day
to see if maybe one spot opened up I
don't know some schools have text
message alerts if a class opens up mine
doesn't but I would go back five times a
day and check it class open up and I
would sweat manipulate my schedule I
think I made about maybe not exaggerate
250 scheduled revisions because I was so
obsessed with making it absolutely
perfect and I did I thought I had a
great freshman schedule and many people
will tell you that if your freshman
schedule is gonna suck but no because
you have the power to change it as many
times as you want to do nothing that one
schedule will be stuck with it and
that's a I've number six is that you do
not need all of your clothes and I know
this is gonna sound like the my dorm
closets this big I can't fit all my
clothes but really I maybe use 25% of my
closets that I brought to school in my
dorm closet it was kind of small not
really is I'm like I the very first time
I moved in I would definitely pack way
way less and then if you need to you can
have your parents ship you some clothes
or you can drive if you're close enough
number seven this did not apply directly
to me but kind of but it definitely
applies to like 99% of the people but
ATMs are different than high school most
high schools start at around eight or
even earlier my school started at eight
o'clock and I had yeah I didn't like
waking up but it wasn't the worst thing
in the world but in college having an
8:00 a.m. class is awful and like many
people will tell you that it is like so
so horrible and I'm a morning person so
honestly eight
we're not awful for me because I liked
getting out of class early but just
waking up at 8 a.m. is so much written
about 7 a.m. it's just so much harder
than high school and in high school I
would wake up at like 6:30 because I had
to drive to school and stuff and I think
I put in more effort upload I was
wearing to class on my idioms but in
high school but like in college having
an idea I'm awful and you can wake up at
7:30 walk to your classes 7:45 and be
there but it's still so so much harder I
don't know why I really don't but yeah
idioms are different in high school
number 8 there will be people to go out
with you any day of the week if you
really want to so definitely take
advantage of like the fun things that
are going on and don't just like if you
really don't wanna go you don't have to
go but like if you want to like
obviously take advantage or the fun
thing but just know that if you miss out
one Saturday there will be other
Saturdays there will be other Monday
Tuesday Wednesday is like people go out
every single day of the week obviously
some are more popular than others but
I'm telling you you will have someone to
go out with every day of the week if you
want to number 9 make a list of the
delivery restaurants in your area and
because you will be using them so
definitely know which one so you're not
stuck on just ordering Domino's Pizza
like every week like we ordered a lot of
pizza and like then we were like okay
guys we got stop ordering pizza
but yeah delivery is awesome because
sometimes if you don't have a car you
can't really get there and if you do
have a car you don't want to drive so
yeah we number 10 this one sounds a
little bit cliche and you probably heard
it so many times but it will seriously
go so go by so fast like I honestly
cannot believe I'm done with my freshman
year of college it felt like it was
maybe three months long like it really
did not feel long at OU I remember when
I remember moving in so clearly and I
remember first semester like vividly I
remember my schedule per semester like
it seriously goes by so fast so
definitely take advantage of it and like
I said go meet new people go be a part
of clubs and stuff but I'm telling you
it goes by indeed the link of an eye and
I'm kind of scared because a freshman
year with my past college thing go by so
fast and then I'm gonna have to find a
career like that
me out number 11 is that you Wilbur's
touch with some people in college
unfortunately but fortunately at least
in my case when you get back in the
summer it will be just like high school
again which for me that was a great
thing I had such a good group of friends
in high school and luckily most of my
friends went to UNC which is 30 minutes
away from NC State which I go to NC
State and that was like awesome because
I get to see them all the time but for a
lot of people I lost touch with people
at college not gonna lie didn't talk to
them and then we would hang out again
when I came back for the summer or for
breaks and it would literally be like
nothing changed so that's the good part
of it but yeah definitely expect to lose
touch with some people because college
and that's okay like you don't even keep
in touch with everyone but you will keep
in touch with the closest ones to you so
just keep that in mind
number 12 kind of relates to food
actually it does your lights of food it
is keep snacks in your dorm room
I'm so many times that I was like oh my
gosh I wish I went grocery shopping
because my roommate would be eating and
like I would be so hungry in the dining
hall would be closed and I wouldn't want
to spend money on food and I would just
want to snack and so you definitely want
to keep snacks at all times all times in
your dorm room and my 13 also has to do
with food and it is the freshman 15 is
real but I will tell you it is mostly
because of beer I did not you drink so I
didn't gain the freshman 15 but I could
tell definitely the people who did
definitely drank like it was because of
the air like period so definitely if
you're gonna drink just keep in mind
that you might want to workout the next
day or something like that or not I know
but you will gain weight if you drink a
lot and in college you're gonna drink
way more than you did in high school
I can't are just to use my friends and
stuff so yeah keep that in mind that if
you're just ten if you're going to go
out which is totally fine just expect to
gain weight number fourteen you
definitely has to do with me and that is
it's okay you don't know what you want
to do later in life I know what I want
to do as in major wise and degree wise
which I am majoring in industrial
engineering
you guys know that which may come as a
shock to you guys but yep that's what it
is let me know if you want me to do a
video on my classes or anything if any
of you guys are planning on going into
that but yes so I know that I'm gonna do
that and I'm pretty set on it but I
literally have no idea went on and you
career-wise I don't know where I want to
apply I don't know where I want to live
half the people over half the people in
my grade and of my friends don't even
know what they want to major in and
they're done with freshman year and that
is okay definitely kind of have an idea
but it's totally ok if you don't know
what you want to do because half the
people don't or 15 this is kind of a
weird one to leave on I honestly did
these totally random in no order but it
is form study groups in your classes I
didn't meet that many people in my
classes but the people sitting next to
me in my classes I would always be like
hey I'm Natalie what's your number so we
can like study together it's not creepy
guys it's not like hey what's your
number like trying to hit on you know
it's literally just form study groups
and because you guys are all in this
together that's the great thing about
college you guys really aren't all in
this together and it's it's not like
high school or it's super catty and
whatever like it's not like that at all
so enjoy it you'll love it and honestly
if you guys don't like your college
experience if you have the ability to
change it there's transferring there's
making new friends second year trust me
there will be a ton of new transfer
students and just new opportunities to
meet well and yeah just like if you
don't like your where you are right now
in college you can change it even if
it's not train transferring you can
change your situation which is so great
cuz in high school you couldn't really
do that because there was only certain X
amount of you and you can't really
change schools that often so yeah I hope
this has helped you guys and if you guys

in college if you're in college leave
