today I am filming a video that is long
do I have not filmed in a long time
because of finals coming up it's the end
of the school year but hopefully this
video makes up for it so I am doing a 20
things I learned before I turned 20 so
my birthday is actually tomorrow which
is when you guys will be watching this
and it is my 20th birthday so I really
like watching these videos or people
saying life's lessons they've learned or
these like 20 things 21 things 18 things
you know those videos tell me if you
guys learned any of these lessons or if
you guys liked this video or any other
things that you guys thought I may have
added or yeah comment down below if the
first one is that people try to make it
seem like what they're doing is really
really fun on snapchat I just noticed
that because it's like that's one thing
I've learned especially with social
media being social media present and
just having a lot of girls from my
sorority and just things like that when
they go out everyone has their phone out
and everyone's like taking a snapchat of
something and then you'll watch it the
next day and be like wow that looks like
a lot of fun and I was there and it
wasn't but you just like it's like
people just try to make it seem like way
more fun and that is number one thing I
learned because if you go out to a party
in college I think everyone will just be
having their phones out snapchatting the
whole thing and what's the fun in that
number two is that it is okay to not
have a big group of friends and to be
lonely sometimes
that's one thing I learned throughout
these years of my 20 years of existence
and sometimes I'm used to kind of having
a big group of friends in high school I
did like senior year I definitely add a
big group junior year I had a sophomore
year I had a big group junior year was a
very lonely year for me and I realized
that was going into college I thought
that I was gonna make a lot of friends
and have like a huge group of friends
and I don't and that's okay I have a
small group of friends that I'm really
really close with and I think it's
better than having a big group of
friends but something I learned is that
it's okay to not have 30 million friends
like that's fine if you just
have a few good ones because the good
ones are better than just a big group of
random people number three is that I've
learned that you should always follow
God no matter what you're going through
he will lead you to exactly where you
need to be and I am a Christian
obviously if you can't tell from my
other videos and for me stating this but
yeah so I just that's like the biggest
life lesson that I've learned over these
twenty years that if you just follow God
he will lead you to where you want to be
sometimes you think that your plans are
better than his but they never are and
even if it takes you a really long time
to figure that out
he will show you his plan and his glory
for you instead of your own and that's
just a big like life lesson that I've
learned number four is to not trust
shady guys and they are shady for a
reason so that is the another thing that
I've learned that just with guys if a
guy is really doesn't just like if a
guy's berry player and like text a bunch
of girls and all this stuff like chances
are he's always gonna do that so yeah
that's just one thing I've learned if
he's been shady in the past like don't
trust him everybody has to do with the
last one and it is don't take people
back that have cheated on you that's one
thing I would definitely like I think
number six is that your true friends it
will support you and what you do and
they will not be embarrassed of it
obviously with YouTube comes kind of
some embarrassment especially in high
school when you tell people initially
and yeah I make youtube videos which it
totally shouldn't let's like take away
that embarrassment from people forever
but yeah so if you like do a blog or
YouTube or something like that
chances are they will have been one
point in your life where you have been
made fun of or just that someone didn't
really support what you were doing or
thought it was weird or whatever and
that's totally normal but your true
friends will not be one of those people
number seven is that people think being
trilingual is super cool and that is
something I have learned in my
years of living because I speak Spanish
Romanian and English and when I liked I
didn't think that it was that big of a
deal growing up and then when I like
told people that everyone thinks it's
super cool so something I've learned in
fun fact number eight is that YouTube is
the best decision that I have ever made
it is seriously hands-down the greatest
thing in my life like I love YouTube I
love doing it I love filling for you
guys um yeah basically YouTube is the
best thing number 9 is that when people
don't try new food that I have realized
is my biggest pet peeve
so yeah that's something I've learned
about myself that it whenever yeah I'm
like at a restaurant or something like I
love Cuban food I love Thai food those
two are like my absolute favorites and
like if I take my friends there and
they're just like what's that like just
try it
ok I don't know this is the biggest pet
peeve of mine and I didn't know that was
a pet peeve until I actually got into
that situation so that is something that
I have learned about myself the 10th
thing that I learned in my 20 years is
way too much calculus definitely I have
learned too much calculus that I think
number 11 is that coffee can be either a
very very good thing or a very bad thing
it's very good because I obviously love
it and it definitely like keeps me up
when I need to be up and stuff like that
and I just love the way it tastes
honestly but it can be a very bad thing
because I am an extremely dependent on
it and I get caffeine headaches so if I
don't have caffeine I get a headache
like right now I have a headache
and it's time to make a coffee run but
over 12 this is kind of random but there
are what I've learned in my 20 years is
that there are a lot of people who do
not know geography and I just learned
that because I'll be trying to say I
like I'll say something sometimes I'll
be like oh yeah like I went to my
parents are from like Honduras in
Romania and the amount of times I've
gotten stares and people are like
where's that it's just like I don't know
you should kind of know the general
vicinity of where a country
I think if we were all citizens of the
world like we should know where things
are on this earth but especially in your
own country like some people don't know
what that New Mexico is a state like
things like that like come on guys
that's just something I've learned that
I never knew before like high school
when I actually started like talking
about I into casual conversation and
people are very very confused number
thirteen is that I am not good at sports
so that's not very a shocker to anyone
but yeah I learned that about myself
number fourteen is kind of a funny one
but it is that I don't look good with
yellow hair so I hope it's actually
talking to my friend grace yesterday
which I'm in her room and she's actually
sitting right there
say hi grace Hey yeah Thursday it's just
hot to me films I've recently dyed my
hair darker and I used to have like
yellow hair and it was just bad like I
thought I was blond
but it was actually yellow looking back
at pictures and thank you to Steph my
friend Steph here on YouTube who told me
like girl you got it you just gotta
change it Thank You Steph because now I
like this so much better number fifteen
is that I do not do well in cold weather
so also not a very big shock but I do
live in North Carolina where it's not
freezing or anything like that I mean it
can be but it's not like I live in
Alaska or like up north or anything like
that but yeah I just absolutely hate
winter and I get in such a bad mood when
it's cold outside in the first hint of
summer you will see me wearing shorts
and a tank top like I need to be wearing
those clothes I just like absolutely
love summer weather and hot weather the
16th thing that I've learned is how to
deal with a breakup so in my 20 years of
living I have dealt with a breakup and I
think that's a very valuable thing to
know how to do because a lot of people
don't know how to deal with it
and I have experienced it which
obviously I kind of don't want to
experience it again but I mean I have so
yeah that's something I've learned in my
20 years number 17 is that I've learned
how important it is to be genuine and a
nice person I have met a lot of people
that are very rude
I have met a lot of people that are
extremely nice and I don't know how to
tell you how much more pleasant it is to
be around the nice person number 18 is
something actually very bad that I've
learned but I have learned how to stay
on top of my schoolwork while skipping a
lot of class and that's like very bad
but in I don't like elementary school
middle school high school I literally
was the kid with the most absences like
if there was an award for who has the
most absences it would have been me
never gottena is that I have learned how
to that losing friends is kind of a part
of life and it sucks but it's just a
part of life and sometimes you lose
friends and you don't know why and it's
like just as bad as heartbreak and other
times you lose friends and then you
realize that it was a good thing that
you guys are not in each other's eyes
like it's not any like bad separation
thing or a big fight that had to happen
it's just you realize you guys are two
different people than you were when you
guys were best friends in elementary
school or middle school or high school
or even college and it's okay to lose
friends you don't need to latch on to
every single friendship you have if it's
not a healthy one number 20 is that it
has to do with kind of the be nice thing
but is that making fun of people because
of who they are or how they look or just
just making fun of people in general
it's so not cool and I don't know why so
many people do it it's not a cool thing
so people should stop doing that
including Pete making fun people on the
internet like I yeah so those are the 20
things that I have learned and I hope
you guys like this video I hope that you
guys maybe learn something that you
don't know from it's maybe not maybe you
want to add anymore but if there's
something that you have learned that I
didn't cover police come in it down
below just anything you want to comment
I just want to talk to you guys and yeah
I hope that you guys have a wonderful
day and thumbs this video up make sure
to follow me on all my social networks
um snapchat Instagram all that stuff
yeah so have a great day and I'll see
you guys next time
