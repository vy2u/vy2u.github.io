favorite to do and that's kind of crazy
just because she's important he went by
really fast and I think all of you guys
will agree it was a really big year for
me I graduated high school I entered my
first year of college I finished my
first semester of college I survived
final exams I know it was just like up
is here for me and I also kind of want
to apologize you guys I didn't really
film and she does 14 that much I mean I
film towards the end like past month for
like throughout the whole 14 I was not
very consistent and that is going to
completely change just 15 I've so many
videos for you guys and I am really
hoping to just film a ton and just
create kind of really great content
anyways I'm just gonna kind of jump
right into my favorites with video and I
have a few things from each category to
do so the first category is going to be
a foundation so I have two favorite
foundations for this year and they are
both drugs or products and I will have
all the products listed in the downbar
below but my first product is the
L'Oreal True Match Lumi foundation I
recently discovered this the second half
of the year probably around like fall
break so maybe octoberish so it's very a
new favorite for the year but i
seriously love it so much and then my
next one is this neutrogena skin
clearing foundation this is a little
dark for me but I still wear because
it's such an awesome foundation I really
love it I think it's just ok foundation
and it I don't know if they actually
help to clear my skin but it doesn't
make you break out so that's based
all that matters for me and they're both
really get covered not cakey doll and
you can fill them up tomorrow morning
I'm actually building a foundation
routine year so make sure that you stick
around and subscribe to my channel so
you can see them next favorite good has
to do with face but have it some the
powder so my favorite powder and then
make up for ever HD powder I have been
using this powder for a long time I am
always with this powder like I this is
my go-to I always subtract between this
and I've Revlon Photoready but this one
is a lot better in my opinion it just
makes it like it's so she pictures your
skin looks like silk in real life your
skin looks and feels like silk like it's
seriously awesome i love it this is my
student grades for foundation and it
really makes your makeup lasts a lot
longer than any other powder that i have
tried my next one also has to do with
the face it is my favorite primer and
this isn't really a primer I guess but
it's my makeup setting spray primer
makes me break out I have yet to find a
primer that hasn't made me break out so
if you guys have the same problems me
and you found one let's do in the
comments below because I'm really trying
to find one but for the moment this is
awesome does make me break out and it
really does at like let my makeup stay
all day long I know it's technically all
nighter so to those to be like when
you're going out at night but it's not
over my makeup like three times over my
makeup doesn't ruin it or anything and
it's just super quick and easy and
really really makes it last and I
haven't seen any problems with this this
is definitely to be able and a purchase
of mine this is my first boggle my next
favorite is going to be my favorite
concealer so this is a mac
I Oh mineralize concealer so this is
what it looks like this I'm telling you
guys I've never had a better concealer
in in my life it is seriously so like
like a coverage I guess it really does
the job like means if you put it on your
pimple and then you kind of blend it out
it seriously will cover it it's totally
buildable its sequel my concealer that I
like and I am going to keep repurchasing
this is my second one and it's your CD
best concealer ever I normally never use
ever under eyes I have you to pressurize
and it works great this is mainly for my
blemishes that I have like for example
one right here on my forehead but again
i'm done with my foundation routine so
you can want to see how i cover em up
next favorites i'm gonna just show too I
products um my I favorite eyeshadow
primer has been be back pain hot it is
in the color fair study I really like
this because you can wear this alone as
an eyeshadow or it's just a super pretty
color for any eyeshadow base or any
eyeshadow this is a great base for just
because it's a really creamy color I've
worn smoky eyes and I've used this like
this is awesome for anything and it
really makes it last all day and I like
how you can wear as monotone as well and
then my favorite eyeshadow is Lindy
naked 2 palette um you stop choosing
between naked and naked too I don't
really wear naked 3 I like it but I
don't wear it that often but the naked
chick how it seriously has every color
that anyone will ever need if you guys
don't have it or if you guys are
debating between buying one 20 or 30 i
would recommend buying the second one
because it's the best one and then the
first one and then the third one in my
opinion i just don't really wear thanks
a lot but if you do wear pink then
definitely the third
but yeah this urban decay is my favorite
I showed up and by far I like them
better than math better than like any
other one and so all of them in one
palette is like the best thing ever I
wear this every single day basically I'm
kind of for like your skin um all that
stuff my favorite moisturizer of the
year has been this bowl I fresh effects
long live moisture and it is um satin
finish and let me tell you guys it
really does make your face feel like
sign or so or something like that it is
so so shocked it does make me break out
it really moisturizes in my face is just
so soft which is that's what my favorite
part about it is I love him soft skin so
this has definitely been my favorite one
um it's like awesome for all of my skin
needs I will always be purchasing this
one and I also used to be obsessed with
the Garnier skin moisturizer which is
still really really awesome but they
don't sell it everywhere and this one's
just a little easier my favorite hair
product for the moment is this dry
shampoo um this batiste dry shampoo a
medium brown color obviously if you're a
blonde if you don't need this but I have
the room dark brown roots and whatever I
could normal dry shampoo my hair turns
gray and I looks like an old lady and it
takes forever to plug in and so this is
perfect like I wish I would come up with
this because I would read millions by
now I just come up with hey why don't we
do a tainted dry shampoo for people with
dark hair so that's why this one's my
favorite just because it's dark pair and
it really does choked up um the grease
like I worked out this morning and put
my hair who get that sweaty but I still
kind of felt gross so I just wash my
body and then put dry shampoo and I
don't know you guys can tell me if my
hair looks pretty or not but I think it
does the job
well my next favorite hair product is
this garnier fructis we can shine I've
talked about this in so many videos I
will not shower if I do not have this
I'm just kidding but this is my favorite
favorite thing ever if you would leave
me with no hair products at all leave me
with this like this is what I need my
hair gets really very tankless its
pretty long my vs cattell and this is
basically the only thing that is like
makes it super soft doesn't make it
greasy it makes it smell good it's just
the best thing ever I cannot even tell
you how many bottles of this I had
purchased like I'm going on vacation and
I can't takes on a plane i'll i will buy
at the place like i need this and it's
not expensive at all it's a drugstore
product so make sure you guys check this
out if you guys like leave in
conditioners because i just have gone
right after the shower and i'm pretty
generous with them out i put on and it
doesn't leave a greasy acceptance it's
super soft and i can tell a tremendous
difference what I'm doing when I'm using
this and when I'm not using this when I
hop out of the shower and let me tell
you it is a big difference guys okay so
that is it for my hair makeup favorites
but now I'm going into the clothes
favorite which I only have a two things
for you guys so and it's basically only
one thing so I'm just gonna get right
into that ok so my favorite clothes of
the year have been these um really big
like t-shirts like really long gonna tee
shirt dresses I love them because you
can wear that in the summer or the fall
and trust me I've worn them in both and
you literally can dress them up or dress
them down as much as you want there's so
many different options to wear them
that's this video app that we can want
me to devote a whole entire video just
on how I style these
because let me tell you I style them a
ton of different ways like I wear these
all the time I kid you don this one is
from a winter and I will have the link
down below and this one's from brandy
melville these are not the only two I
have I have a lot of different colors so
i think i'm going to do a video solely
devoted to these but yeah um also if you
want you check out my hall um that was
great okay you can check out my whole
and I have those and then i have this
and then i have this shirt and then I
have these leggings in it actually just
so my foot these leggings in the hall if
you want and beats blueberry everything
um so yeah if you don't check that out
you can um but anyways I also have some
kind of miscellaneous um favorites
combine and so I decided you can make it
little fun since I am on youtube I kind
of want to make a youtube related so I
was going to say my favorite youtubers
of the year um my favorite YouTube
videos film and I am kind of coming up
with this lil mizz fly so does supernet
also my favorite youtubers have
definitely been macbarbie 07 which is
bethany mota and i'm even know people
call her macbarbie 07 anymore I had a
lot of she's getting a lot of hate
because she's like on dancing stars and
she's filming is often but I think it's
awesome what she's doing and I think
that it's just like really cool how um
she's basically like completely built
herself her own Empire basically like
she has her clothing line her bedding
line she's probably gonna come up with
more things and like instead of kind of
being mad at her for doing that I think
that we should all be kind of proud of
her for doing that for actually
achieving that because I'm sure that all
of you guys want would want to do that
if it was offered to you and it's not
even like it was just operator she
worked really hard on it so
yeah I really like her and she's kind of
like an inspiration of mine um I'm
trying to thank you well my favorite I
like be on a shark oh yeah but my
favorite wine of the whole year probably
has been asked me to go guard I really
like her I like the editing everything
like that so yeah I really like her own

thousand fourteen i think i've seen all
the videos and I destroyed like them and
I kind of get inspired by your editing
as well as for editing and Gabrielle
Marie I shot her out in my blog and yes
this link that she's probably pay me to
shut her out she's really not guys I
just literally watched every single one
of her YouTube editing videos so if you

come up with how to edit your videos
