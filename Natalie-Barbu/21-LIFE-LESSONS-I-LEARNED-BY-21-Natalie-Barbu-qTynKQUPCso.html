am showing my 21 things I learned by 21
I just turned 2 in 1 last weekend I love
showing these videos I have other videos
like this I have things I learned at
college or things I learned after my
freshman year or something like that I
think I did 20 things I learned when I
was 20 and so of course some of these
will be similar but I just love sharing
advice to give you life lessons and
years of any other life lessons that you
guys learned that I didn't mention in
this video comment down below again
these are all personal to me but I hope
that I can maybe have some things on to
you if you're new to my channel this is
the first video that you stumbled across
to load we're going to get real personal
real fast um I have a lot of other
videos see us and get to know me or just
other like lifestyle videos that I do so
you guys want to subscribe to kick
around that would be awesome
and follow me on social media to learn
more about my everyday life and without
further ado let's inserted the first one
is who you surround yourself with is who
you become and this is kind of one that
it's not exactly like oh you're going to
become that person if you hang out with
someone you hang out with a lot of
negative people and all the time they're
bashing themselves or all the time
you're talking bad about other people
it's really hard to not become that
person and that is something that I have
definitely learned and my parents always
tell me that when I was whenever I was
kind of hanging with like kids what they
did was like I guess with a high school
or like you're going to become like who
you are is your friend group like that
is who you are is going to become like
why would you be friends with them you
know so that is really really true so if
you want to be a positive happy person
hang around positive happy people they
will lift you up and then you will list
others up number two is that you may
change your thoughts and opinions as you
grow up and that doesn't make you a
hypocrite so a lot of times in high
school I had was very like I believed
one thing and that was it and just like
with opinions rise not really this is
really talking about like who huge
things but I mean it could be but just
like random little things that I thought
I was like this is true this is really
the way I think it's like 100 percent
right and I think roll over and as I
experienced warm lines and other meet
other types of people I realized that
some of the things I thought I don't
really agree
anymore this doesn't mean our music rate
that's only because you thought one
thing then you change your opinion in
the future of the year hypocrite
it's healthy to grow and to continue to
mature and I honestly hope that none of
you guys have the exact same beliefs as
when you were in high school - when
you're older not saying that some of
them are going to be the same 95 percent
90 percent of my opinions are the same
and I still believe in my core values
but there are some things that you are
going to make sure you're going to grow
as a person and that doesn't make you an
appropriate that just makes you human
number three is that not being like
everyone else is actually a good thing I
had other interests in other people
everyone was kind of focused on like
partying and schools or focusing on
college applications and seven so agai
but I also have this whole entire life
look on YouTube and no one else knew
about and I was really really
embarrassed by it in a typo I actually
didn't even tell anyone about my youtube
channel besides my closest friends and I
were just so weird to me now like I
can't doubt even a match with hiding
this part of my life from people but
like I literally there's someone
competent on my video like oh my god our
summer concert on my Instagram I love
your videos I was literally delete their
Cod because I did it well people knowing
like looking back I'm so ashamed and I'm
so sorry if you were one of those people
because I don't know what I was thinking
but that's better like oh my gosh I'm so
weird when I'm like this and no I'm
really thing like this is something
really awesome that I'm doing and I am
so happy where I in the heck would I
hide it from the world number four is to
save your money so this is the thing I
really emphasize it's a long philosophy
how I have money to travel because I am
a college student and I don't have a
real job so people ask me how I have the
money to travel how I have the money to
like spend money on things that I do and
my answer to that is saving saving
saving so whenever I get a paycheck I
split it
I split like 60% into my savings account
and I do not touch that and looks like
emergency reasons but like I am really
really good about like not touching for
saving so I just leave it there it's
been growing from high school I think
this is my favorite has are growing
since I was 16 years old so I leave that
in my savings account and
I think I put 20% towards traveling so
I'm going to put like if you guys love
shopping put a part of your paycheck to
is just sign clothes because then you
won't feel guilty about it but you know
that you're not spending your whole
entire paycheck on clothes so it's a
percent of my money on traveling and
then the other half I think I go into my
just checking capsule of a monitor like
groceries or whether I put that there so
that is what I do with it's been really
really helpful
I definitely saved a ton of money over
the years and just being able to put
aside something that I love so much like
I put specific amount for traveling I
don't feel guilty when I spend it number
five if you have a job so this pertains
to that one of the biggest life lessons
I have learned is through money and
discipline and having a job having a
schedule I think having a job when you
grow up it's so important and I know a
lot of people need drums so they're
probably like what if this girl telling
me that just to have a job respond no I
don't think it's fun you might hate your
job but I think that in high school
having a part-time job really teaches
you a lot of lessons and just making
money from the beginning I think teaches
you the value of a dollar honestly like
I've learned so much if I didn't have a
job in high school or multiple jobs
actually in high school then I don't
think I would really be that financially
responsible as I am now never fix is
that your first boyfriend or your first
love might not be forever and that is
okay I think in high school at home or
young or even maybe middle school you
think that the person you're with the
person that you're going to be with
forever and honestly for some people
that is totally the case and it's good
for you like that's so human but for
some people it's not and it's kind of
hard to come to terms with the fact that
like your first love wasn't like your
old love I just think it's important to
realize that God has a bigger plan for
you than this one guy and then you
should not I know like heartbreak it's
not like get over it like I have a whole
video well not two but just I think it's
important to come to terms with the fact
that like if you break up with your
first love it's okay and it will be okay
number seven is do not do anything that
you don't want to do this attitude with
peer pressure this has to do with
anything in life like if you don't want
to do something please don't do it
because you will regret it and nothing
is like in India soma whatever like if
you truly do not want to do something I
there's a reason for that and I would
not
how are you and if you truly don't want
to do something because you think it's
wrong and option you're about like hold
your values hold your foundation down
and say you know what no and if you're
departing people and they're pressuring
you to do something I sound like a 50
year old but under drugs kids but really
like if you're with among people they're
pressuring you to do something you don't
want to do no one could hear you say no
in a tower from now like maybe in the
moment day like oh my gosh you're so
lame like tomorrow say well you may care
and you will feel guilt free number
eight is that a lot of people will only
want to be your friend when you are
successful or when you're doing
something with your life or when you
look happier like I notice that a lot
people will all of a sudden that like
ignored you will be retaining like
remember me we were such good friends
like worried about number time is
pertains to mean specifically but I have
realized I am so much like my mom like
the older you grow the more you're going
to realize that you are like your
parents number 10 is not really like a
limitless but it kind of is like an I
feel you type thing acne is the
absolutely worst that is definitely
something I've learned I've definitely
struggled with acne in the past right
now my skin is perfect clear which I'm
so happy about like you guys there good
times what I have had really bad acne
and I totally feel your pain number
eleven is that time and prayer do we do
you all still discuss the procas
hardness goes with something feeling
guilty rare like if you're feeling
guilty about something
pray for forgiveness pray to God talk to
him like this is definitely something
for me personally and also time number
12 is that the couple's like
relationship troubles that you see on
social media might not always be
relationship goals and that is something
I feel very strongly about talking back
around the other day about it how this
one couple that I know they post on
social media a lot and everyone is like
oh my god names are perfect relationship
goals whatever and I know deep down that
it's not actually a healthy relationship
and so I think that happens a lot like
you see big celebrities and I don't know
their lives at all but you see them and
they look so happy everyone wants to be
like them and then a day later they're
broken up and like it's like the worst
breakup in history you know things like
that like but you will agree you just
goofy okay
together the other night looking all
complete standard came home want to do
that is that no one should be your goal
people should not be your goal you might
aspire to have some career you might
aspire to dress like someone who ever
have this style but a person cannot be
your goal and I see Belle on Instagram
when people are always saying oh my gosh
you are goals if you are goals verbatim
and so much not me really I should not
be anyone goal she should not be anyone
cool famous people should not meet your
goal you can aspire to work hard and
potentially like has some aspects of it
like oh I want to be an actress goals
whatever I wanna be a youtuber goals I
want to have your style because I love
your outfit gold but a natural person
should not be and especially should not
be based on social media because II was
no idea what people are going through
and I just think the whole full sync
with a lot of unnecessary pressure on
people and it should just go away
forever number 14 is that being nice is
a lot easier than being mean just be
nice people guys it takes more energy to
be mean and to start talking bad about
someone and just being negative and
bringing everyone around me down then it
does to just be nice so just chill over
it be nice number 15 though relates to
that also it is that being nice does not
mean that you left will walk all over
you though that is something that people
need to realize and especially be there
is the line of being nice and being
completely walked all over and letting
everyone step on you and dump standing
up for yourself you definitely should
stand up for yourself if you're not
being disrespected you do not need to
like kiss asses be nice you can stand up
for yourself so that is something that
my parents have always taught me know
actually be nice but respect yourself
stand up for yourself and don't let
people talk down on you and look down on
you number 15 is that every single
person feel block sometimes especially
in college I will be having a senior
soon I'm going to need a senior like two
weeks three weeks that's so weird to me
I have no no idea what I want to do
after college like I have no idea where
I'm going to be what I'm going to do
like anything like that I have no clue
and that's really scary
no I'm talking to all my friends in
really all of us are in the same boat so
that makes me feel better but at the
same time it's really scary but it's
important to know that you're not alone
number 17 it's okay to have friends that
have different interest in you and this
is different than like oh I have an
interest in being nice and they have an
interest in being rude and talking about
what people know about interest like it
a lot of my friends like I love super
girly stuff together make it up fashion
and my best friend she is like a biker
not biker like we're cycling chairs
marathon moon so I'm like if you don't
have to have the exacting interests of
people and make things interesting
crisis of apathy there are new clones of
each other so that's also something to
remember
you could have friends and sexually
probably a good thing number 18 is that
quantity is greater than quality I don't
college especially during the sorority
and stuff which I had saw all these
girls with a bunch of people that they
were always in groups with 15 of them
have silver solder snapchats and
pictures and then I'm realizing like the
more I see that the quality of super
quality is so attractive and quality
like I don't know those real
specifically but in general and you see
Baker people a long time when you're
hanging out as an individual one of them
they talk so much crap about each other
and look at your best friend I'm not
saying that out of whole you can have 20
real close friends I don't know you so
what you definitely can but I'm just
saying that having a couple of my really
really close friends and not having to
think about other 15 people that I'm
hanging out with at all times even
though I don't really like them that
much they feel guilty so I mean hanging
out them having a little about a
friend's a better amazing friend is so
much better number 19 is that College is
hard but it is not as hard as you might
think
so I am an engineering major engineering
is definitely one of the hardest majors
that you can do in college but now so
scared going into it but the more I
think like and people always say
nightmares metaphysical or not it's
impossible so hard yet not gonna lie
it's very hard you might fail a couple
classes of guys like that's fine but I'm
saying that you can definitely do it
it's not impossible it's all we put into
we're connecting is impossible this
number 20 is that today are going to be
as a see
they're able to be very many creepy guys
out there in the world and you should
100% ignored every single one of them so
especially being myself and putting
myself on the Internet
I have had so many creepy guys coming
and message me comment on my videos and
like after those engineering videos does
enter your video like they were like 60%
guys that watch them and normal videos
of mine don't get a male audience and
but let that one did because it's
engineer you didn't like engineering is
predominately male and like well some of
your comments guys if you're watching
this please don't comment something
creepy because it freaks me out and I
just walk you like if you prompted them
to compete you're not watching this
because I already walk you just like
moving them look like I don't know just
something I've learned and I didn't
really have to experience earlier in
life but now that such a time on the
Internet like oh my gosh these things
that some people say do you talk to your
mom at that mouth that's an insane
number 21 unless finale is to thank God
for everything that you have in your
life that is something that I've learned
again these are all personal to me so
these might not even pertain to your
life at all and you're like I don't
believe in that at all that's why this
is just my life and I want to share my
life lesson camp minutes right is that
thank God for everything I have I always
do that because I realize no nothing
here without me on youtube I would not
go ahead and say I'm not be do anything
that I do if it wasn't for God so I just
always always remind myself of that and
it's really hard to get carried away but
once you kind of guys are so back to
reality that's what I like to do I'm so
sorry this video is so so long I thought
it was going to be that long but of
course I can't make a video that's that
short I hope you guys enjoyed I give two
thumbs up if you have food and any other
video requests that you have in the
comments below I really want this comic
section to be active and discussion so
please please please comment any like
lessons that you learned or any that you
agree or disagree with in the comments I
really want to have like a conversation
