tips on how to be productive how to get
stuff done how to just be your own boss
and control your life and not constantly

constantly feel like there's not enough
hours in the day or you can't finish a
goal or you don't have any goals or
anything like that because you know why
it is still the New Year New Year's
resolutions are still sort of happening
I feel like most people have given up on
them already but it's not too late and
you don't need the New Year to start at
resolution but this is definitely
definitely for you if you guys just feel
like you're in a slump or you just need
a little extra push and motivation
basically a sign saying hey you you can
do it this is your sign this is gonna be
five tips on how to be the best girl
boss that you can be if you guys are new
to my channel please be sure to
subscribe down below
I post videos every Tuesday and Friday
and we just hit a hundred thousand
subscribers which is insane and I'm also
hosting a giveaway right now so if you
guys want to enter before the end of the
month be sure to do that I'll have that
link down below also but it's a huge
giveaway so you definitely don't want to
miss that I'm just gonna get started in
the video and share with you guys my
tips I need to give you a little bit of
an about me background for those of you
that are new here majoring in industrial
engineering and I'm also doing youtube
full-time it's definitely a little bit
of a challenge to juggle both of those
but I absolutely love it and so many
people ask me how I do it and how I have
time to do it and of course there's
different ways on how everyone manages
their time but I'm just going to share
with you guys my best ways of how to get
stuff done because when I set my mind to
something you guys you better believe
that I am doing it and I am just an
impulsive person that really likes to
try new things start new things I really
want to own my own business one day you
know so these things definitely are
always gonna be in my head to motivate
me and to make me realize that you know
what I can do this and yeah I'm the boss
so first
I have them written down because that's
one thing you should be writing stuff
down but anyway it's like it's to not
have negative thoughts on yourself or
others
so this one is so important because I
feel like in order to go out and really
like finally start your own business
finally start a YouTube channel finally
like even like have a goal and finish a
workout routine or something like that I
feel like one of the things that it
starts with is your mind so a lot I mean
most of this is very mental like if you
keep putting yourself down if you keep
having negative thoughts in your head
you are never going to do anything
because you're constantly telling
yourself you can't yeah like that would
be cool but like I'm not big enough or
yeah I'd be cool but like I'm not
popular enough or I don't have enough
money or I don't have whatever all of
these things that you're thinking in
your head instead of saying okay how can
I make this happen if you don't have
enough money right now how can you make
make enough money you know like it's all
in your mindset I really truly believe
that a lot easier said than done and I'm
not saying if you have positive thoughts
then everything great will happen to you
but it is a lot easier and if you have
negative thoughts I can assure you that
no person that has started a business or
has started something been an
entrepreneur or anything like that they
never started with negative thoughts I
don't know about you guys but I just
feel like when I'm with my friends or on
like Tumblr and Twitter and stuff it's
really really cool and popular and funny
to like put yourself down be like oh I'm
trash or I'm garbage or I'm like
whatever like kind of like funny humor
but it's like putting yourself down that
humor is not funny and it honestly is
really really hurtful to yourself
even if you might be kidding and stuff
the more you repeat it the more you're
gonna actually start believing in so
let's ditch that humor leave it in 2017
and 2018 we're only saying positive
things about ourselves also if you're
talking about about someone else I just
feel like that shows so much more on you
and how unhappy of a person you are so
just try to be a happier person but it
really really is not like a good thing
to talk others down and that's never
gonna help you out like if you're
talking about others I mean I don't know
what good that does to you the next one
is one that many people hear all the
time and they kind of roll their eyes at
but is to wake up early and
sir sighs and so I'm putting these two
together because for me it is so
important and I feel like my mindset has
changed so much when I wake up early and
when I start to work out I have become a
new person I know that it sounds so
cheesy and so stupid and you guys are
definitely rolling your eyes as I would
if I was watching this before I did this
but seriously I am a morning person so
it is easier for me to wake up early I
am not a night person but of course I
don't want to wake up at 6:30 every
morning or 7:00 a.m. every morning but I
do it because I disciplined myself to
say I have to do this because then I
have to workout and then I can get the
most out of my day if you're waking up
at 10:00 a.m. and then maybe working out
and then your day starts at noon you
lose so much of it I can get so much
more stuff done when you're up before
the rest of the world is because you
have a piece in your head your thoughts
are cleared
you're not like worried about everyone
else and you can just look at the clock
and it's 10:00 a.m. and the fact that
you already completed a workout or the
fact that you already completed a
workout ate your breakfast made your bed
clean your room did all this stuff and
now you have the whole rest of the day
to focus on your work I think that is
definitely something that like I now if
I wake up past like 8:30 I'm mad at
myself because I know how productive I
am in the morning if you're not a
morning person and you say that you're
not productive in the morning try it out
for two weeks and see because I feel
like it just is better when you wake up
before everyone else does and also I
recommend more exercising first thing in
the morning it puts your day off to a
great start because you already feel
accomplished already feel like you did
something I never drink coffee in the
morning because I'm so much more
energized from my workout and it just
makes you feel good and I feel like once
you start seeing results once you start
feeling better once you start realizing
like this is the only body you have and
you're nourishing it and you're making
it feel good and your myth keeping
yourself healthy that that also is just
going to make you feel so much more
productive and it's just gonna put you
in another mindset and I know that's so
cheesy but it really is true x1 is South
care is important so against all these
girl boss habits I feel like it's like
do this do that do this do that but
honestly you have to focus on yourself
so if your self care routine is laying
in bed with a face mask on and watching
Netflix make time for that because you
will go crazy if you don't have that
time
if it is reading your Bible in the
morning and reading your Bible at night
or whatever it is make time for that but
reading a good book make time for that
if it's hanging out with your friend and
getting a cup of coffee with them make
time for that it is so important to not
just be go go go go go because you will
get burnt out and then you will
eventually hate what you're doing and
completely make your life miserable
definitely don't overwork yourself you
need to have time for yourself that is
honestly one of the most important
things and I feel like people don't say
that enough because I feel like they're
like oh if you want to do this well then
you have to make to-do list and wake up
early and you have to exercise and you
have to go to coffee shops and work for
five hours a day and then at night you
have to have a night routine and then go
to bed and then your day is done and
then you redo it and you just work work
work work work and that is not good me
to take time for yourself or you will
get burned out trust me
the next one is to ask your friends to
get stuff done with you so I'm not
saying to ask your friends to do you
favors and to make them your assistant
personally I like going to Starbucks to
do work that's just my personal
preference and I invite a friend because
if not I feel like I'm gonna be sitting
on my phone and not wanting to leave and
being bored but if you bring a friend
and they're also doing work you've kind
of feel pressured to do it like that's
why I sometimes like going to the
library because when I'm surrounded by
people that are working I'm like alright
I gotta be in work mode that is one of
my favorite things to do I almost do it
I do that so many times every time I go
to get stuff done unless I like have a
lot to do and like need to study and
just be like by myself and alone then I
won't ask anyone but if I just need to
catch up on some things and really want
to be productive in my day I ask a
friend to come with me
ends up being I get work so much more
because you have that time and you can
like take a break and talk and not let
yourself go crazy out of boredom and
just frustration and then you can go
back to doing work because both of you
are doing that and have an understanding
that this is what you're there for so
that's one of my favorite things to do
and it's a great way to socialize mixed
with working and then the last girlboss
tip is I think the most important one so
after this video I want you to take
action I have had ultimate trouble with
this because I feel like when I watch I
just read the book you are a badass and
I watched so many like girlboss
inspirational entrepreneur videos like
day in the life of a sea
type of videos and like but how to grow
up business tips how to do this tips how
to be your best self tips whatever I am
all for that and I watched those videos
and read those books all the time but
I'm constantly reading those books and
watching those videos and I'm not
actually living my life so I want you
guys to turn this video off when you're
done with it and actually go and take
action instead of watching another
girlboss video that will probably be
suggested in the downbar below because
if you guys don't take action what good
is it yeah you're watching this but like
how are you gonna put it into your life
so write down some things you want to do
and go and do it live your life and live
your best life and honestly just be a
girl boss because I know that you can be
and you know that you can because that's
positive thinking and you guys can
seriously do it and I know this is like
literally my most cheesy video but ever
since I just like this year and the past
year it has like completely changed my
mindset on what I can and can't do what
I want to do in my life where I want to
go the direction I want my life to be in
and I've kind of honed in on my skills
I've honed in on what I really want to
like how to go about living out my
dreams and it's been amazing an amazing
amazing gear and I have followed all of
these tips that I shared with you guys
so I really really want you guys to
start doing that and kind of video off
and start doing it instead of just
watching another one I'm watching
another one and watching another one
because yeah they're entertaining but
that's not how you live your life and
that's not how to be a girl boss I
really hope that you guys enjoyed this
video and it's a little different than
the other videos I've done because they
don't really do like motivational videos
like this but I really like it because
it's just been on my mind lately and I
needed to get this video out there for
you guys so if you guys like this video
let me know in the comments below give
it a thumbs up these tips were short and
sweet but I really hope that you guys
liked them and I'll see you guys on
Tuesday bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
