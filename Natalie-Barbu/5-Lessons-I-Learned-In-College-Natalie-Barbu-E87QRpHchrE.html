case you guys were wondering yes I did
get my hair cut this is so weird
my hair has not been this short since I
was maybe five years old like what it's
so weird it's so different I really
really love it though I just kind of
wanted to change and yeah I just kind of
want to address that in the first minute
of this video because like what sorry
I'm looking at myself and like the
viewfinder and like it is just like I
can't put on my hair to one side because
I kind of can't but like it's so short
back to the video hi if you guys are new
to my channel be sure to subscribe give
this video a thumbs up all that stuff I
post Tuesdays and Fridays and today I'm
going in College video just because I
felt like this was the perfect time to
do it kind of before the fall videos
really start happening which I'm
starting to film Halloween tutorials
which I'm really excited about so be
sure to subscribe so that you don't miss
those because I've never failed in
Halloween videos before but this year
I'm actually going to and those will
start next week I'm hoping five lessons
that I learned in college I am halfway
done with college which is absolutely
mind-blowing I'm actually more than
halfway done since we're halfway done
with first semester already uhm yeah so
I'm a junior in college and I'm halfway
done with my first semester junior year
and it's just weird that I only have two
years left it's like really really
freaking me out I don't like it at all
because College is like my happy place I
absolutely love College it's so much
better than high school like I don't
know I just love college so much so I'm
really sad that we're halfway done but I
learned some lessons along the way and I
feel like these videos I absolutely love
feeling like the ones where I just sit
down and talk to you guys and kind of
share with you what I've learned and
just kind of tell you lessons that I've
learned so that you guys don't make the
same mistakes or also so that you guys
don't feel alone if you feel like some
of these things you're going through
right now highly recommend watching my
two videos ago I kind of read through my
journal from high school and it was a
very deep video kind of yeah I really
loved today I got such such a positive
response and a lot of my friends
actually texted me like hey like
thinking about you going through this
whatever cuz this month has kind of
sucked but it's getting better and yeah
I just want to address that before I
started but without further ado I'm
going to chose guys five of the biggest
lessons that I've learned in college
thus far so the first one ironically
today I get my haircut is that it is ok
to change so not just changing
physically even though of course like
that's always ok too but just it's ok to
change as a person the person that you
are entering college highly likely is
not the person that you are going to be
as you leave college you don't need to
make drastic changes you don't need to
have like a complete 180 or anything
like that but like it is ok to realize
that you are growing you are evolving
you are the coming of the person that
you're gonna be for the rest of your
life maybe you'll probably change again
in the next 10 years I'll probably
change every year I don't know but like
it is ok to change it's ok to realize
that you want to be a better person or
it's ok to realize that like you're not
being the best person you could be it's
ok to realize that the way that you've
been living might not be the way you
want to live as you go on or just
realizing more about yourself like I
think that's a beautiful part of college
is that I have learned so so so much
about myself you don't need to kind of
leave home to go to college but most
people in the u.s. do and just leaving
home and being more independent and just
being by myself a lot and like being
with friends all the time or you know
it's just like it's you learn so much
about yourself and you learn so much
about the person that you want to be
like you will realize that in high
school everyone's kind of the same and
everyone feels like they have to kind of
fit in this bubble but you don't have to
and college definitely taught me that it
is totally ok to realize that you want
to change and it's ok to not realize it
and slowly go along with it and then
kind of realize it at the end like oh
gosh I changed a lot like that is fine
you don't need to be the same person
that you were when you were 18 or 17
it's I don't know I just feel like these
past two years I'm like don't even
recognize myself my 18 year old self I
don't know I just feel so much more
mature and so much more like I know what
I want and I know the type of life I
want to live and number two is that
you have to be selfish sometimes so this
one is a little different because a
selfish is always kind of like a bad
thing like if you're selfish that's bad
but in this case in college I think
these are the four years where we are
allowed to be selfish we are allowed to
put ourselves first and I mean not be
selfish as in like don't care about any
other people's feelings it's like you're
hurting them but it's okay to put your
feelings ahead of someone else's when it
comes to your own self so if it comes to
have like a friendship and like you
realize that they are not the best for
you they are not supposed to be in your
light like that friendship is toxic it
is okay to think say to yourself like
I'm doing what's best for me and I need
to cut you out of my life like I'm sorry
if that hurts you because a lot of
friendships can be toxic and college
you're kind of like kind of forced to be
friends everyone like you don't know
anyone deeply like it's kind of all
surface level because you meet people
and then you're friends best friends
with them in like six months not even
like a week you can be like oh my gosh
you're my best friend and you just met
and you guys don't know each other but
it's college and everyone needs to make
new friends so you're making new friends
and that's like totally fine but like if
you realize that it's a toxic friendship
it is okay to be selfish to put yourself
first me like you know what no like I
need to pick you out of my life for
years these are the four years where we
are focusing on ourselves like please
take advantage of it cuz after this
we're gonna have jobs or we're gonna
have families or and you can't really be
selfish and that what we're doing right
now we need to be it like this is paving
our way for the rest of our lives
essentially and so we should be doing
something that we absolutely love so
even if you're like friends are all
doing one major and like you think that
that's what you want to do but really
it's not like your parents really are
forcing you to do something but like you
absolutely hate it this is the time to
be selfish the these four years are
gonna pave kind of the rest of our lives
in a certain way and so you really want
to do what's best for you please like
use this time to do you to be yourself
like I don't know I just think that
these four years are the only years that
we're gonna be able to do it and I've
definitely took into practice like being
selfish a little bit and these past like
two years that I've been here freshman
year I kind of wasn't I put everyone
else first I let people walk all over me
and
and yeah it honestly wasn't that great
and then sophomore year I kind of
realized like hey no I'm gonna do what
makes me happy and that's it and then
junior year this year I'm like really
coming to terms with that and I'm really
like okay you know what
if something isn't making me happy I
need to get away from it or if I think
that I need something else like I need
to do it I don't know that's just my
advice I hope that this helps in any way
shape or form I know it's kind of like
vague but of course it's different to
everyone so if you want to do something
that makes you happy go ahead and do it
like don't hurt other people along the
way but put yourself first and make sure
that your happiness and that your like
mental health and everything like that
comes before worrying about what other
people think third thing that I learned
third big lesson is that you have to
have your goals that need to be against
yourself they should not be against
other people high school I feel like
everyone kind of you're kind of
competing against other people like who
can get into the best college who can
get the best SAT score a CT score
whatever like who can get like date the
hottest guy I don't know high school
things um in college your goals that
you're setting need to be against
yourself because again selfishness like
kind of comes hand-in-hand like
everything that you're doing like who
cares what other people think who cares
what grades other people are getting
what majors they're in your goals need
to be against yourself so some of the
goals that I have in college one is to
graduate like that's a huge goal of mine
which I'm on the right track horror like
not really worried about that one next
one is to grow my YouTube channel this
one has nothing to do with anyone else I
don't care about anyone elses channel
this is only for me I want to become a
better at like filming and I haven't
done any like really filming videos just
because like haven't had time slash this
month again like I'm saying it's kind of
sucked so I haven't really been
motivated to do it but filming wise like
I want to get better at filming and
being better at behind the camera as
well as in front of it but like being
better behind the camera in an editing
like that's such a big goal of mine and
I'm setting that against myself against
my past videos I'm not really looking at
other people in competing against them
or my goal is to get fifty thousand
subscribers by the end of the year and
holy oh my gosh you guys we hit 46,000
already like that is insane this line
has been a huge month for the YouTube
channel so thank you guys so
I love you guys if you guys are new or
newly subscribed comment down below I
would love to get to know you and meet
you and yeah follow me on things comment
on my things like tell me that you're
new like oh my gosh just thank you so
much and thank you to all my OG ones
like you guys Rock like I just love you
guys so much you guys have been so so so
supportive because I've been saying how
like this month kind of is like and I've
been getting so many messages and
comments and like oh my gosh I just
honestly I cannot believe that you guys
follow me into our subscribe to me you
guys are the best like loyal fanbase
ever I love you guys and I don't I
picture us more like friends because I
actually chat back with you guys like
messaging back and stuff so yeah thank
you I just
mini shout out to you guys here so your
girls should be against yourself like if
you wanted you need to figure out what
you want to do in life and set those
goals but not because of other people so
yeah it kind of goes handing out the
selfishness thing don't worry about what
other people are doing or what other
people are thinking life is too short
for that and also this is too big of a
time with too much happens in these four
years that shape your life that you need
to be worrying about what other people
are thinking the fourth thing that I
learned is that time goes by so so so so
so fast I remember being a freshman so
well I remember being a senior in high
school so well for like freshman year of
college it's so weird to me that like
that was two years ago I feel like that
was just yesterday so that's why that's
like so so weird but yes the time goes
by so fast which again this kind of ties
into all of them these are all kind of
in a theme don't waste your time
worrying about what other people think
don't waste your time figuring out like
what you want to do because you don't
know like do what you love do what your
passion is that these are the years
where we can do that like I cannot
stress that enough and if you keep
pushing it off and saying I'll do that
next year I'll do that next year no you
won't because time goes by way too fast
don't waste your time do what you love
do it quick do it now not to pressure
you guys like now now now you have to do
it or else like your time is being
wasted but like I mean honestly it kind
of is so if you're in college make the
most of it
take look up clubs you look up things
that you're passionate about like
there's so many resources that you can
use at your university that are so so so
helpful that people don't know about
Alec
look up like NC State like things I want
to do like just random clubs or anything
like that and I'll find things that like
but interest me or anything like that
and then you'll meet people that
interest you too and that's how you
maintain friendships and that's how you
make like great friendships when you
have things in common with people so
that means that time goes by so fast
don't waste it but also enjoy it because
it is like the best four years of your
life and number five is that it is okay
to break down sometimes so I've had
mental breakdowns many times in college
just kind of like holy crap I don't know
what I want to do is I like am I in the
right major what am i doing like do I
even have friends I feel like no one
likes me like am I wasting my time and
blah blah I've had so many of those and
I've also had things where I'm like oh
my gosh like I just failed this test
like I'm not prepared for this I'm not
prepared for the real world blah blah
blah all of these things and I've talked
to a lot of people that have the same
thing going on you're not alone and this
is not just you you're not the only one
even though everyone that seems to have
their life figured out literally like
everyone I talk to I'm like how do you
have your life figured out no one really
does everyone is alone just like you
like I'm sure if you look at me on
Instagram and you see that I had an
internship and I have this channel going
for me and I'm an engineering major and
like all this stuff and like whatever I
look like I have it all together ha ha
ha funny funny funny funny like jokes on
you i have nothing together I just feel
like I have no idea what I want to do
when I graduate I have no idea where I
want to live I have no idea like what's
in store for me with relationships and
friendships and just like life in
general like am I making the right
choices am i doing like the right thing
I'm so much pressure on me to be the
best that I can be in like what the heck
am I doing with my life like that is so
common and I was talking to someone the
other day who like also was like yeah
like I honestly have I feel like I'm
such a failure bla bla bla and then I
have to think to myself like I had 20
years old I am NOT a failure do we
should not be having these mental
breakdowns we are so young we should
just be living our lives need to realize
that it is okay for us to not be like a
hundred percent all the time like that
is totally fine and that is something
that I need to actually keep in mind
because I put a lot of pressure on
myself and then I also think that like
oh my god like Who am I as a person like
I'm failing or I'm like horrible of
whatever no like everyone's going
through this everyone
everyone in college is even if it looks
like their life is all together half of
the time I'm actually more than half
every single person I've talked to their
life is not together and you will have
like a mental breakdown in college at
least once or twice at least maybe once
or twice a year definitely but the fact
lessons I learned I hope that this video
was helpful in any way I love sitting
down talking videos but I'm so excited
to get into like better filming videos
like I said that's one of my goals and
yeah so I hope that guys enjoyed this
video make sure to give it a thumbs up

hair like if it shoots me or what I'm
