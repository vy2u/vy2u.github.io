I am doing a sit-down talking video I am
so excited to do one of these because I
normally don't do just like sit down
talking to a camera videos so I feel
like this one is gonna be a lot more
personable and personable is that a word
I don't know but you guys will get to
know me more obviously this video if you
can't tell is 50 random facts about me
and it was very hard coming up with 50
facts about myself because I feel like
there's I don't know what to say so a
lot of these are just like little mini
things
so but I am doing this because we hit
50,000 subscribers on my channel you
guys so thank you guys so much I love
you guys if you guys are new please
comment down below because I've been
getting so many more subscribers lately
like I've been growing a lot quicker
than I've ever grown before so I just
want to say thank you guys so much so I
wanted to make this video so that all of
my news subbies can kind of learn more
about myself or more about me and a lot
of these I've kind of like talked about
in videos so they might have been old
videos so most of you guys probably
don't know like any of these facts and I
just want you guys to actually get to
know me and I don't know I'm not just
watching my videos for like my makeup my
fashion but also we're becoming friends
but number one is that I speak three
languages a lot of you guys probably
don't know that but I speak English
obviously Spanish and Romanian my mom is
from Honduras and my dad is from Romania
I've gotten so many comments if asking
if I'm Romanian because my last name
barboo is a Romanian last name and
answer that yes I am number two is that
I have been to ten countries obviously
the US I've been to because that is
where I live
I've been to Honduras I've been to
Mexico Bahamas Jamaica st. Maarten st.
Thomas Haiti England and France
so yeah ten countries guys number three
is that I have lived in seven different
houses in my life and I've lived two in
Florida and then five in North Carolina
so I'm only twenty years old so seven
houses in 20 years I think is a lot
number four is that I was born in Fort
Lauderdale so if any of you guys are
from Fort Lauderdale or Miami
I'm like in the suburb like kind of in
the middle of both of them that is where
I was born Broward County number five is
that I am an industrial engineering
major so a lot of you guys are also
surprised by that because typically
people who do YouTube are either
youtubers full-time or do something
related to fashion if they're doing the
type of videos that I'm doing so I do
like fashion lifestyle videos and so
most people think I'm a fashion major or
something along those lines but I'm
actually an engineering major so yeah
fun fact for those of you guys who did
not know that
number six is that I am 28 years old I
get a lot of comments asking how old I
am because people tell me that it looks
super super young and I've gotten that
so many times people think I'm 13 years
old sometimes which honestly is kind of
insulting but whatever in person people
like really do think I'm so young at the
airport I always get told like oh no
sweetie like you don't have to take off
your shoes it's for 12 and under excuse
me I'm to me number 7 is that I am a
junior in college at NC State University
so I only have one more year left after
this year and the ID like don't really
know how to process that number eight is
that I had laser eye surgery when I was
2 years old never 9 is I had braces for
four years so for those of you guys who
are going through the awkward stages of
braces it gets better I promise and yeah
I had braces for four years they did
everything to my teeth starting in like
third grade I had stuff going on in my
teeth I had like a spacer I had some
like weird thing that I had to like
tighten I don't know I just had a lot
going on with my teeth because they were
so messed up I had four permanent teeth
removed because my mouth is too small
and my teeth are too big for ten is I
have scoliosis so I have like a mild
form of it like it's not that bad but my
spine is definitely curved number eleven
is that I have three siblings so I have
an older sister who is 26 a younger
sister who's 15 who you guys have seen a
lot and a younger brother who is 13
years old 12 is I am 5 3 some people
have asked me that before because on
camera and you really can't tell how
tall I am I'm pretty sure I'm only 5 3
and I say that but like I'm not even 5 3
I'm like five two and a half
13 is pretty random 1 but my little
sister when she was 13 had a birthday
party and she invited like the whole
grade so there was a 200 people invited
like so many people and everyone brought
gifts and so typically like Oh what are
you girls like Starbucks everyone
basically got her Starbucks gift card
but she doesn't like Starbucks like she
doesn't drink coffee she doesn't ever go
to Starbucks but me her older sister
over here like is the Starbucks addict
so she gave me all the gift cards I had
over $400 worth of Starbucks gift cards
and I sent it in like six months
number 14 is that I have into way too
many concepts to count like I don't even
know how many concepts I've been to but
fun fact is that last year the
chainsmokers came to Raleigh for a free
concert and I went and like no one knew
who they were and I mean I know who they
were but like no one else knew they were
so as I come with me like please like
buy tickets and everyone's like I mean
okay like sounds like fun but and now
they're like blowing up and tickets are
like one hundred and fifty dollars for a
ticket and like a huge stadium so I
thought that was pretty cool number 15 a
lot of you guys know this but I was in a
sorority in college and I am not anymore
so I was in is a d'etat alpha and I
dropped this past summer just because it
just wasn't for me like I realized like
I was doing too many things with my life
where like I didn't have time to commit
to a sorority so I decided to drop
number 16 is that I really really love
calculus as an engineering major you
kind of have to like calculus because
you go all the way up until calc 3 and
then even after that you have like a lot
more math so I love love love calculus
and I absolutely hate physics like
physics chemistry by Alec all that like
I hate all science classes number 17 is
that I will eventually live in New York
City I am telling you guys this this is
a fact even if it hasn't happened yet I
will live in New York I don't want to
live there for life but I want to live
there for like one or two years and I'm
really really trying to get an
internship there this summer but after
college that is definitely the place
where I want to live number 18 is that I
have an apartment in Miami so I told you
guys I was from Florida but I also have
an apartment down there and I go down
there all the time so if you guys are
from Miami believe a comment below
letting you know who
all my Miami people are number 19 is
that my very first kiss was when I was
16 years old and it was super awkward
and gross honestly and it was in a car
number 20 is that my favorite color is
blue I basically like all shades of blue
so that's why it's my favorite color
number 21 is that I love reading I have
always been known from when I was little
that I will always have a book in my
hand I don't get to read as often as I
would like anymore because of school and
YouTube and stuff but I love reading
number 22 is I had four tops in high
school my first one was at chick-fil-a
for four months and I hated it um my
second one was at American Eagle and I
loved it
third one was at Auto Bell which is a
car wash near me and I was like
hands-down best high school job and then
my fourth one is at a small boutique or
I live but that actually was in high
school that was like during the summers
in college so number 23 has to do with
number 22 but I actually had an
internship with Ralph Lauren last summer
and it was with their operations
development team so it was wind with the
like engineering department and that was
a really great working experience number
24 is that I had only had two boyfriends
in my lifetime I feel like some people
have like 20 million and I'm like how
but I have had to number 25 is that I
have been to three Hilary Duff concerts
I was like Hilary Duff fanatic when I
was little um I was obsessed with her
like more obsessed than I've ever seen
anyone be obsessed with a person she was
my idol she was everything she was like
I wanted to be her like I loved her so
much number 26 is that I have met some
of my very best friends on the Internet
and I don't think that's weird like my
investment staff of she I met her on
YouTube when we went to New York
together I went to this here in LA just
come to visit me we went to New York
twice together actually my friend grace
we actually D and each other on
Instagram but she like lives near me
I've actually met up with a ton of
bloggers that live around me just from
meeting like on the internet even my
roommates like technically we met in
person but like we met on Facebook first
gen that's how we can't became roommates
so yeah you know what meeting about the
Internet is good just like be safe kids
but like it's not as creepy as it used
to be number 27 is like crew
or my favorite thing in the world so
like I have a special place in my heart
for cruises and I think that whenever
I'm on a cruise I'm the happiest number
28 is that I would love to kind of get
into the more like film part of just
film agenor like I would love to try out
directing or I would also like to dive
in to photography I don't know I'm just
like really into working my camera like
figuring out how it works and like
getting cool shots and stuff like that
so I really want to do that would like
to work behind the camera a little bit
more 29 is that for those guys who don't
know I actually want a contest called
YouTube Nextup where YouTube sent me to
New York with other Creators and they
gave us twenty five hundred dollars
worth of gift card and a $25 gift card
to bnh which is just like a Best Buy so
that's how I got like cool equipment for
my videos but yeah that was really cool
because not a lot of people won and I
was one of I think 15 people that won
the contest for 30 is that pickles are
my favorite food I love pickles I have
eaten a whole pickle jar in one sitting
and like that's not even a surprising
thing number 31 is I am a Christian so
my face is super super important you
mean like number one thing in my life
and I don't talk about it that much in
my channel not on purpose but just
because a lot of my videos I like makeup
and fashion based so I can't really like
put that in there but in this video I
figure this is the perfect time to say
that so yeah that's a huge important
thing for me so if you guys have any
questions about that in the comments
like I would love to answer them number
32 is I have never gotten a speeding
ticket but I have gotten pulled over
twice and once was going home for winter
break and the second time was coming
back from winter break like what but I
got warnings on both of them so for 33
is that I'm really bad at paying
attention in class because I actually
wrote these 50 back so while I was in
class number 34 I wrote snapchat score
because I thought that maybe you guys
cared um my standard score is 28,000 115
a lot of people have like in the
hundreds of thousands and I'm just like
do you not communicate like do you only
communicate on snapchat that's insane to
me so yeah 28,000 I don't know if that's
a lot I've seen way way higher so I
don't think it's a lot but yeah tell me
what your snapchat score is and if I'm
like way behind you guys
because I would like to know and follow
me on snapchat 4:35 is I'm one of my
roommates actually fought on the Fosters
kitten so if you do follow me on
snapchat you'll see that I always have
stories of little baby kittens running
around and doing cute things and that's
because my roommate Foster's been number
36 is that this isn't really like a fad
don't know I was like kind of running
out of ideas but it's that I feel like I
never have free time
balancing school and engineering and
like YouTube takes so much time along
with just like having a social life in
general because I'm not one of those
people that like my social life is a big
thing like I will obviously I'm not
gonna go out if like I have a test but
like I am gonna try to hang out with
people as much as I can whenever I do
have free time because I feel like it's
really important to have friends and I
don't want to be one of those people
it's kind of like always in her room
like doing stuff I don't know I feel
like part of college is socializing
number 37 is that my favorite season is
summer that is not a shock to anyone
because I absolutely hate cold weather
number 38 is that I want Best Dressed in
high school so that was actually pretty
cool 39 is that I want to do weekly
vlogs number 40 is that I haven't had
the same roommates all of college number
41 is that I have been watching Grey's
Anatomy since I was in seventh grade so
I'm an OG Grey's Anatomy fan and spoiler
alert when Derek Shepherd died I
honestly felt like I had lost my own
husband I started bawling when I found
out that he died without even watching
episode like I had seen it on Facebook
like are you kidding I saw it on
Facebook before I saw the episode that
he died and I started bawling number 42
is that my dream is to work for a
creative kind of like media company or a
fashion company so trying to figuring
out how to mix in engineering with that
but if not I always have my youtube to
be like hey guys look I'm actually
creative too number 43 is that when I
was younger I actually wanted to be an
author so that's funny because I hate
writing now number 44 is that this year
I've already applied to like 20
internships for next summer so that's
always fun 45 is going back to my laser
eye surgery that I hadn't noticed you I
also used to wear it on my patch when I
was younger
number 46 is that when I was young
I would say that I want to get married
by the age of 20 can we just take a
moment just like laugh at that like
number 47 is that I didn't publicly
announce my YouTube channel until
college and I started in high school but
I took a break and I was not serious
about it in high school and I got
serious about it in college but yeah and
publicly announced until then number 48
is that I have never seen Harry Potter
or read any of the book 50 is that I
have never been in a real car accident I
say real because at one time I hit a car
while I was parking
I don't really count that's like an
accident I've never been in like driving
and then like accident or like a
rear-end but I did hit a car while
parking so those weren't my 50 random
