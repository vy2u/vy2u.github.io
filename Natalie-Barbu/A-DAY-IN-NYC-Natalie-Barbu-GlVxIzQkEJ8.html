white sandals but I like these a little
better then I'm wearing a skirt from
free people which fun fact I got this
for like $30 or something like that
pretty cheap for Free People
was on sale and they had like a million
of them I guess cuz no one wanted them
but like I think it's so cute and then I
have this crop top it is like a crop
tank top I actually got this a few years
ago but it I didn't wear it and now I
like have found so many outfits to wear
it with so I'm really glad I kept it
it's a light baby blue with like crochet
and like cinched a little bit over here
I don't know what this material is
elastic and then I am having a denim
jacket just kind of draped over because
that's what New Yorkers do have noticed
they just hang them and then I have a
choker on from brandy melville I have my
rings that I wear every day and yeah
this is my outfit guys and then my purse
is this it just from Free People as well
so yeah you guys will see more of it in

this city it's so small tastes like oh

already alone there and it was really
really good so that video but yeah the
coffee's really good too
okay guys so we just went to Gramercy
Park went to Gramercy Park and we're
idiots and we like didn't know that
we thought it was like a public park you
know you need a freaking key to go and
that's so snobby and annoying yeah so
like we asked and then they were just
like no like you need a key like okay to
like it looks you know like the people
inside we're kind of like looking at us
like like from the outlet the whatever
the person cleaning and you just kind of
looking at us like to like let us in

right next to Mark Twain House which is
a real big highlight for me it's right
where is it right there that is Mark
Twain's house guys it was I was Highland
time didn't really know he lived there
when he was 65 years old
in fact 1900 turn-of-the-century bro
obviously I'm a nerd thank you to
whoever lives here for letting us shoot
here I don't know some lady walked in
and was like oh yeah you guys can have
the steps so pretty cool I'm great I
mean it's like an apartment I guess like
multiple people live here hello beauty
Katy's outfit so cute let's do another
day okay actually I want to tell you
this my name's Lisa Dookie and this is
her designer mr. Brandt and these
bracelets in these earrings

a little break and this is where
exhausted bag was heavy and I don't know
we just needed to charge our scheduling
like important things we're just like
hanging out like a schedule freed up for
an hour now it's like my schedule that I
made yeah so we make 80 bucks change so
we go to a new outfit of the day all
right so out of the night I guess it
should be is my dress is from Windsor
store it's like a body con but it's like
super comfortable it's a tight and
Katie's outfit of the day
persona it's a little and then shoes the
same like me look at hot we are walking
on Lafayette Street in the middle and
there is this really cute concept
oh it's share your story so people
strangers have been sharing their
stories and it just says hi there I'm
collecting your stories stop and share
anonymously or just say hi and ask a
what for so it's a really cool idea I've
been reading some of them some of them
are really really sad some of them are
really funny I don't know it's just an
awesome idea hearing other strangers
stories it'd be very very inspiring
currently at via rainbow Wow in Brooklyn
I didn't know this existed but grace
told me about it shout out to grace
patio like Nick Katie oh me katie has a
new outfit of the day it's our third
outfit of a day everyone went with
dresses and then I was wearing cotton
romper and I fell it was Wednesday time

jumbo we just down under the Manhattan
Bridge so we haven't just been taking
some kicks as all babies and sights the
end I've never been here before and I

Humphries apartment so that is where Dan
