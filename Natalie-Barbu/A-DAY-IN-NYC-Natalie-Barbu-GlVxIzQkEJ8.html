name and you're so much fun that I think
this most adjust the bad shit that's
definitely tops together I agree like I
do I agree we also thought of big booty
Judy does I'll get that I got it was
funny but grace is like an it'd be
funnier if your name was stupid yeah
okay what's to it was I think a new role
would be funny and it's get followers
and it would attract attention so throw
a charge attention I don't know if it's
footage awesome right like people
looking at porn and like a boy would be
very very Louisiana zamane Robert yep so
we are back at Greece's apartment we
took a little break and this is where
exhausted k bag was heavy and I don't
know we just needed to charge up and
stop having a little break in our
schedule our schedule I say it like

just like hanging out like a schedule
freed up for an hour now it's like my
schedule that I made um yeah so we me

new outfit of the day alright so out of
the night I guess it should be is my

that I got at artisan please in chelsea
market so yeah oh I like it and then
shoes are the same like me yep look at
hot we are walking on East Street and
lafayette street in the middle and
there's this really cute concept oh it's
share your story so people strangers
have been sharing their stories and it
just says hi there I'm collecting your
stories stop and share anonymously or
just say hi and ask a work for so it's
really cool idea I've been reading some
of them some of them are really really
sad some of them are really funny I
don't know it's just an awesome idea
hearing other strangers stories yeah
it'd be very very inspiring currently at
the rainbow wall in Brooklyn I didn't
know this existed but grace told me
about it shout out to Greece how do you
like it Katie Oh me katie has a new
outfit of the day it's her third outfit
of a day everyone went with dresses and
