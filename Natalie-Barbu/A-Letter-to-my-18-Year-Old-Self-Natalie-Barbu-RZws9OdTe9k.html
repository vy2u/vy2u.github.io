young and feel so old you think that
your life is ending because you're
losing your friends family and boyfriend

just the beginning 18 is a big year for
you you're going off to college and

grew up in you'll also have your first
heartbreak and it is going to hurt you

confused you're going to want to believe
him and you're going want to take him
back and you will your friends will be
mad at you and keep telling you that you
deserve better and you won't believe
them
you'll start hiding things from your
family because they would be ashamed and
honestly you start losing pieces of
yourself just for him at this time of
your life you believe that love is
sticking together when you shouldn't
just to avoid the pain you push aside
the lies and the dishonesty just to hope
to feel a little love and then you will
wake up one day and you realize the pain
of holding on to something so broken is
worse than the pain of letting go you'll
cry you'll be sad and then you'll be
angry but you will move on it will get
better and you will feel real love you
will soon begin to feed your passion you
will start filming more and smiling more
you'll soon realize that even if people
make fun of you you don't care you love
it and your real friends support you
oh and don't push aside your family they
really really love you you should let
them know that more often
your mom will become your best friend
and you'll become closer to your
siblings don't take them for granted as
much College will open your eyes and you
will find your best friends you'll
realize how normal it is to meet people
on the Internet - you're going to do
things that you regret and you'll learn
from them you're going to cry and want
to drop out but don't worry that failed
test didn't really matter people will
doubt you and make fun of you but just
try to ignore it those people don't
matter keep going and you're going to
kick ass and eventually you're going to
love yourself your worth is not linked
to a person you strengthen your
relationship with God and you'll see
love you will realize people's judgments
do not define you your past and who you
spent with does not define you your
confidence grows and you are happy you
are so happy
you know your Worth and you won't settle
do you feel so loved the best is yet to
come and this is only the beginning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
