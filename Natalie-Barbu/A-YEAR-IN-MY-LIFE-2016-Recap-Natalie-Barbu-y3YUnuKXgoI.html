it's Natalie kitty this every year but
Wow holy if it's 2016 let me get to
50,000 that is my goal
it's not have the numbers but so here is
a recap of the past year and a cheers to
2017 but I just got my hair cut for
those of you guys have been following me
for a while you know that my hair has
never once been this short like it's
like a legit long long Bob I got to take
you guys along on my college experience
and also I was a little more honest to
me this year I'm almost done with being
a teenager which is crazy 20 things I
learned before I turn into 20 like yours
are my friends
so when I invent my friends I like
inventing to you guys too I think that
it is so important for me as I know I'm
not a huge youtuber and I am NOT a
anywhere owned like a huge platform or
anything like that but I feel like I do
have a platform and I just want to get
the specific across to everyone that
watches my videos including my friends
of my videos I have gone through college
and high school and have seen so much of
this go on and I have experienced it
myself so I feel like I need to talk
about cheating haven't been talking that
much today
awesome today's not the best day it's
just been like
me I actually wanted to address the
events that happened this weekend
I didn't address it earlier I don't know
why but um the Dallas shooting of the
police officers happened and then the
two shootings of the black males by
white police officers happened at this
weekend this week was a really really
rough week I sometimes just have really
awful days and will sit in my room and
cry all day long which is basically what
I did for some of this week it was just
really bad this year was also a year of
traveling for me
from Charleston to New York City stopped
at a Starbucks and we are in where are
we oh just outside of San Jose Thank You

think this is where Apple is we have
bounced a capsule in Central Park ever
before it's really really really pretty
