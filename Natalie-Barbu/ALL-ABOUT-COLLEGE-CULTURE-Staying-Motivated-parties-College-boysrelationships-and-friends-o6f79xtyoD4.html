hey everyone its Natalie here welcome
back to my channel I'm with my cousin
Naomi yeah we just met up and go and
hologram if you guys wanted to DM me
some questions
any college advice video or college
advice questions that you had yeah
anything that like that and you guys
asked a lot of questions so thank you
because it was short notice it was like
an hour ago but I am here in Los Angeles
California if you guys are wondering it
and that's why we are in a different
location but it's our Spring Break so a
lot of them I'm just gonna ask I'm
asking them anonymously because I wanted
you guys to ask me very interesting
questions like any deep personal
questions so I'm just gonna read through
them I actually haven't read through any
of them yet so we're gonna see what
questions they are but follow her on
instagram by the way she does live in
YouTube channel but I think you should
totally make one of these Gardens is
pretty personal but one question it was
a general theme of the questions is how
to stay motivated in school and how to
stay motivated and also have a social
life and like continue doing schoolwork
and Trust driving for like good grades
so if you guys don't know I am an
engineering major I'm doing health
science but when I grad school or
occupational therapy to us ot school for
Drive school so comment congratulations
down below because I'm excited she's so
smart
so how does a motivated we goes like I
feel like our pretty good students like
we both strive to get good grades very
motivated in our own field yeah I'm an
inner drive I guess if you're passionate
about something I think you will think
about like that end goal or like what
you want at the end of it so I think
that's what like pushes me every time I
like do bad on an exam or like I have a
bad week or something like I'm just like
but I'm gonna be an OT it's not gonna be
that I'm gonna get there no matter what
exactly so you just have to basically
keep your eye on the end goal like what
do you want to do so for me like with
engineering and stuff like my end goal
was one to graduate baseline and to get
a good job after college so I knew I
wasn't gonna go to grad school but I and
like I applied to a ton of jobs I made
sure my resume was good I applied to
internships because I was looking more
into the future I wasn't looking in the
moment so of course if you're in the
moment and there's parties going on and
like there's you have a big test but you
also have like a party to go to or
you're just feeling lazy and don't feel
like studying look at the big picture
and realize like after this 24 hours is
up like you're gonna be done with the
test and yeah it's better to just like
push yourself as hard and strive to do
the best you can because in the future
it will definitely pay off but don't
burn yourself oh yeah don't work
yourself out have fun like you yeah take
a look at yourself sometime if you need
it like for sure like don't feel guilty
about like relaxing or like keeping that
sanity because you don't need to go that
balance of like working hard and then
like just relaxing and like I don't know
because I'm like so introverted I tend
to have a lot of time I don't know
so and I mentioned in another video how
like C's get degrees and I got so much
hate on it boy oh my gosh like don't say
that like you need to get straight A's
or colleges won't like no job it's gonna
hire you via get C's and I wasn't
talking about like getting a straight
C's like having a 2.0 GPA like yeah what
I was talking those you're saying like
if you have to retake a class or you
flunk a test like don't beat yourself up
yeah I like life goes on life goes on
people fail and like how you react to
that is how you will like how what's
gonna determine if you succeed or know
if you fail on tests and then you feel
like dropping out of college like then
don't do that you know like give
yourself some wear seeds I think that's
what that thing is about anyway it's
like C's get degrees like yeah like you
didn't do the best but like you tried
your hardest exactly that's you know
what it just keep striving forward
yeah another question that I've been
getting a lot of is how to balance like
social life work and school so for me I
just like I try to knock out all my work
during the week so it's Monday through
Friday I try to kind of like knock
everything out that I have planned I
schedule things a lot so I'm a very like
schedule person like nice make sure that
I had time for things and then on the
weekends it's like my free social time I
don't I go out I go out maybe like once
a month my once a month and I'm like all
right I'm going honestly sometimes it's
like what's the semester like I just
like don't go out that often I don't
like to personally it's nothing other
than like I like I just don't enjoy it
as much as I enjoy laying in my bed and
watching Netflix like this
yeah sometimes go out now like I've seen
here I guess because now like me and all
my friends are like gonna split up soon
so we're like trying to like spend as
much time together but like I think if
you like plan out your time well enough
and like you can definitely do both or
have best of both worlds I think getting
a planner yeah AK you want to motivate
me to write in there so that helps a lot
and then just like I don't know just
making sure you know yourself and know
like your limits and like how much you
need typer studying i think that was a
lot do you not have any more you
literally gone wait no way this is
awkward
it literally keeps going down it started
with 99 FS then it went to 75 r us then
I went to 54 then 135 notes at 18 and
they're gone okay so they all got
deleted okay I said read through a lot
of them though so I just want to give
like general college advice we should
just do that then
so how does he motivated another one was
talking about social life at school so
like parties power college parties how
they describe college parties for me yes
Brad Perry is in when I was a freshman
so TVT to freshman year I remember going
to my first frat party it was like
literally like the night I moved in I'm
pretty sure to college and it was just a
bunch of my friends stay in the
beginning like everyone's invited like
guys and girls because fraternities are
trying to rush guys so they're like
breathing in or yeah they're trying to
like get guys to pledge their fraternity
so they're like trying to show them like
look at how cool our parties are like
that to me from being in high school I
did go to like high school parties but
like in high school it's just your grade
you know it's like what like 50 people
is like a giant
like if you have 50 people at a party in
high school that was like the party get
out here you know yeah when I went to
this one I mean it literally was like a
movie like Red Solo cups on the ground
and like everyone's outside and people
are like all up and down the stairs and
like everyone has a red rose all the way
over there what's that show called like
Greek Greek life Greek it's think you
just call great yeah I never know when I
watched it these days and I was like man
this is exactly what that show is like
it's so I don't know like cliche almost
yeah typical frat parties are like well
yeah they sell lookups like that
everyone is like I don't know has like
some sort of like motive or B yeah and
like you see like sting the girls and
guys and like you can tell that they're
just there to find a hook on like a
honestly that's definitely limit they're
there who are like so many people
obviously not everyone like but a lot of
people that's college is like a whole
new world compared to high school I
would say so like it's very I don't know
it's just like hookup culture is
completely different than high school
because you don't really know these
people you're just like meeting them one
night versus high school I feel like
it's like element she's going down so
you like grew up with them I really
don't have to go don't feel pressure
like I went to that one and I literally
like hated it like I thought it was
awful I just have not a party person and
like if you do go go with people that
you trust yeah like that you're very
comfortable around like a hundred
percent cuz in that environment like you
just you don't know these changes you
don't know what they're gonna do
especially and like look where
everyone's like pretty much intoxicated
like you just need to have like a safe
grip knowing how you're going to get
home like who - like spider
like all that kind of things exactly
don't ever take a drink from someone you
know ever that's very like a real thing
like don't drink from someone else's
copy
don't leave your drink if you leave your
drink on like in a corner and you like
turn around and then you go back to it
just get a new one anyone can put
something in it you know like you just
don't you just want to be safe because
come on it's reality yeah no it is and
especially as girls in college like guys
don't have to worry about as much so for
girls you definitely don't I don't want
to be by yourself have a trusted group
of friends uber if you can I definitely
recommend it like $5 uber ride or even
$15 uber ride it's way better than
something happening to you alone at
night so yeah not to like scary you guys
or anything like that is a great time
yeah for college parties it just is such
a different world than high school you
just become more aware like who you are
and like autonomous and like it's a
great time to like learn who you are and
like who your real friends are and like
what kind of person you strive to be in
the future yeah you'll learn a lot yeah
I know I feel like I'm like a completely
new person from when I had a medical
college so we were talking about that
the other day like I just feel like I
you live so when you're in high school
and when you're living at home with your
parents you tend to like view things
kind of the same exact way as your
parents your family the people you went
to school with like you guys kind of all
have like the same opinions the same
mindset for the most part yeah and
that's totally normal and that's fine I
don't think it's a bad thing because
they're the people that raised you like
of course you're gonna think the same
way is that like that's not a bad thing
at all if I'm expecting my kids to have
the same viewpoints as me growing up you
know so yeah hopefully look at that's
why I'm teaching them because I think
but like when you live on your own and
you have your own experiences and you
see the world in a completely different
way and you're more independent you just
change so much as a person and in a good
way like you learn a lot about yourself
like you learn what you like and what
you don't like and you're not having
like your mom or dad look telling you
what to do all the time so you're making
your own decisions and you're making
them with what you think it's best for
you you know so you just don't learn a
lot and you come out of it a better
stronger person most of the times talk
about college boys
oh I recommend everyone to be single
their freshman year of college I just
think it's better because yeah I don't
know I was not single my freshman year
of college and I wish I was just because
you've kind of thrown into such a new
environment
and you there's so many options I guess
I would say for both you and your
boyfriend if you're dating and it's just
good going into it was like a like no
commitment I guess like not have a
minute but like I feel like 18-year old
guys when they see like these so many
girls that are basically throwing
themselves at them like it's really hit
hard to stay loyal for a guy's point of
view I guess I'm just speaking from
experience a hundred percent think it
can work so this is not like one for all
like everyone needs to be single but
like for me I would recommend people to
be single because you are learning about
yourself you're learning about the world
you're learning about what you like
don't like and just going into it with
someone else attached to you it's a lot
harder is what I meant to say no for
sure yeah like anything just like going
into
school in new environments good to go
like not in a relationship so yeah it's
not attached yeah so you can experience
things falling on your own and like and
that is not meaning like hookups like
I'm not even to know like all like I'm
not a hookup person neither of us are we
don't do that so we're not thinking of
it in that sense just as fairly
experience it's like even if you want to
go travel or try like internships or
anything like that just yeah I think to
like not feel guilty or feel like
somebody is like holding you back from
like making a decision because you know
they're worried about like what that a
person might do or like I don't know I
just think it's better off to just learn
who you are in it I don't know I don't
think a lot of people a freshman year
are that serious yeah that my
relationship with like I don't know I
guess I'm just so much of a marriage
person yeah like I don't date just today
exactly
we're like if we're dating someone we
need to see the potential for them be a
future husband and that's not to say
everyone needs to do that but for us
personally
freshman year like chances are I'm not
gonna meet my future husband freshman
year start dating him that early on and
it's just that's to see what you I don't
know just do your own thing for a little
bit these are selfish years like
seriously no I'm very tired for like be
selfish you don't have anyone tying us
down we all have like kids and a family
and like a dog or anything like tiny
doubt you know like we can do whatever
we want
like the great thing about it like for
friends I've talked about this before I
think it's really hard to make friends
in college like right away from me
personally I just feel like if it feels
like everyone's making their best
friends like within the first week and
you might feel like an outsider kind of
like oh my gosh I don't have a circle of
friends but for me it's like I am NOT a
big group of friends person like I like
having my like 2 or 3 yeah Matt's at a
time yeah like I just I'm not like a
person that has like a million friends
no like one thing that I really learned
in college is that you have to be super
intentional with like hanging out with
people and becoming their friends or
like maintaining that friendship because
it's like only one person like is
intentional with like hanging out or
whatever I like it's not gonna work like
both people have to like make an effort
and like hanging out and like just being
a friend to the other person because
then just won't work and exactly
everyone has different schedules like
it's hard to like you know keeping
constant communication and just hang out
regularly because either have work
college like other things going on so
just being super intentional just making
that effort super point yeah no I
totally agree so filming so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video it's getting
really really long so I'm gonna have to
edit out a lot of it but again be sure
to subscribe to my channel give it a
thumbs up if you like these types of
videos and if you want Naomie
