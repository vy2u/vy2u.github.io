I'm finally filming a video it is really
late on the Friday which today this is
being uploaded and I mean I just had the
worst day ever
so I am so thankful that I'm just
sitting down so in this video I this is
like my fifth time trying to film video
today my camera just wasn't working so
now I am actually at my friend Grace's
health and I am using her camera so
thank you so much grace I love you
you are like a perfect appliance on set
of an everyday makeup routine I am
actually going to be filming my most
requested video and I know a lot of
youtubers are like this - about the
video and it's not this is seriously my
most requested video ever ever since
anyone finds out I am an engineering
major in college everyone wants me to do
a video about engineering I have a lot
of viewers that are in high school right
now and going into college and are kind
of trying to explore different career
paths and I would love to make a video
on different career paths but right now
all I want to start with engineering
just because that is what I am in a lot
of you guys are also surprised because a
lot of youtubers either don't go to
college or when they do go to college
they're more into fashion or something
along those lines so I am actually an
engineering major so I am in like the
STEM program with science technology
engineering math I think that's what it
stands for so a lot of girls are not
into it a lot of people are interested
in why I chose engineering what it is
exactly if you guys could go into it if
I like in it the coursework they load
how much I have to study if the
nightmares like the rumors are really
true about engineering majors so I am
here to answer your most asked questions
also by the way I forgot to say I'm a
little flustered but if you never new to
my channel and want to see more just
like lights out videos about me videos
fashion beauty all of that I post videos
every Tuesday and Friday and yesterday
was so easy to just give up and say I'm
not going to post the video today but I
did it because I am trying to really
really stick to my Tuesday Friday
schedule no matter how much I
procrastinate so be sure to hit the
subscribe button if you guys have not
scribes already and if you guys are
interested in engineering a ton of other
videos so you guys can watch those so
the better question I get asked the most
or I'm kind of that I try doing this in
a structured organized way is why I and
in engineering what it is and what
engineering I am doing so the reason I
chose engineering first of all I go to
NC State by the way which is a huge
engineering school that's like one of
our biggest programs and we're really
really good at it like we're nationally
ranked we're really known for
engineering so that's very good cool and
I chose that school because of
engineering so in high school about
senior year I decided that's what I
wanted to do and it was because I was
really good at math and I loved math and
I've always loved math from when I was
younger like that was always my favorite
subject even though I loved reading I
didn't like English classes and I didn't
really want to go into like business or
interesting like that so I figured
engineering math those two worked out
and backstory both my parents are
engineers and so they obviously
influenced my decision but I'd be lying
if I say that they had no influence in
what I was major in so that is what that
is like kind of my backstory and I am an
industrial engineering major a lot of
other schools call it systems
engineering at NC State they call it
industrial and systems engineering so I
guess it's both of those or you just can
kind of like interchange those names so
that is what my major is and I'm not
really sure how many people are in it I
know it's not the biggest one but it's
kind of just like in the middle it's not
like aerospace where there's like no one
in it but it's not like civil or
mechanical where there's a ton of people
Industrial Engineering is basically just
making things simpler making things more
cost efficient optimization supply chain
basically it's the business engineering
and a lot of people actually say that
it's not real engineering because it's
not like very science II even though I
do have to take a lot of science classes
it's not like it's core focus um so it's
more of a subsistence to write in
engineering which is why I wanted to do
it I would not do any other engineering
um I didn't even look into the other one
so if I didn't get into my department
which is industrial engineering like I
said then I honestly
what I would have done I was between
engineering and fashion textiles because
NC State is also really known for that
but I decided after a lot of thought and
honestly my parents influence I wanted
something more secure and I wanted
something that looks really great on
your resume and I was actually good at
it I wasn't going into it just because
you make a lot of money in because like
it's a good major
I actually was good at math and semi
good at science so that is why I decided
to do that because I thought me doing
YouTube could already get me a foot in
into the fashion world if I wanted to go
that path but I wasn't like stuck into
fashion like it's later I graduate and
I'm like wait I actually don't want to
work in the fashion industry if I only
had a fashion major it really limited me
does not say anything bad about fashion
majors I applaud you guys I'm honestly
some jealous of you sometimes I love I
wanted to do that like I love fashion
and I totally get why you guys are doing
that so I'm not like discrediting that
all I'm just telling you guys how I came
to that conclusion of what I want to
major in and I'm a big believer that
your major does not define where you're
going to end up in 20 years once you
want to be a doctor or a lawyer or
something that's more specialized I
don't think that it really matters that
much both my parents like I said our
industrial engineering majors and they
do nothing related to that anymore it
just kind of gives you the right skills
that you need to go for some life so
yeah that is why I decided to be an
engineering major the next question I
get a lot is what classes do I take how
hard is it um studying wise like how
hard do I have to study so the classes I
take you have to take the gen ed classes
for engineering so no matter what
engineering you are in I have take
calculus lon
calculus to in calculus 3 and then I
also have to take physics one in physics
2 and those are both the engineering
track so my school has like calc for non
engineer majors and then Cal for
engineering majors so obviously I had to
take the 4 engineering majors 1 and then
again with physics it's also like physic
for engineers and physics for non
engineers so obviously you guys know
that I took physics one is just more
calculus based so that's why certain
engineers I also have to take a lot of
statistics as an industrial engineer I
have seek stat1 and stat2
I got credit for
I didn't get credit for that one in high
school even though I took it and I
passed the exam it's because again my
school has a 15-6 for non engineering
majors and one for engineering majors
they really like to separate the two um
so yeah that's why I was had to take it
again in college but I honestly thought
it was great because I remembered a lot
from high school so I did pretty well in
the class I also have to take my core
major classes obviously those are just a
lot of like problem-solving and a lot of
both things as far as math goes after
calculus I had to take some linear
algebra um and I did not have to take
differential equations by the way for
those of you who are not in engineering
this probably sounds like gibberish but
yeah for those that are or thinking
about going into it I'm just giving you
like a realistic saying about my classes
are and I also have to take some coding
but not really a lot industrial
engineers don't really have to code so I
didn't really have to take that it's
just a lot of analytical and
problem-solving skills and then of
course with my engineering classes I had
to take NC State's gen Ed's which are
more of you guys get to do what you want
to do so I took like a the what did I
take I took like a German history class
I took sociology with family I took a
bunch of like random gen ed classes from
NCC so that's also like away from your
engineering classes and it's actually
funny I kind of did worse I'll honestly
like sometimes I did worse in my gen
Ed's in my engineering classes because
I'm like so focused on my harder classes
that was joining the care about my other
ones and like in whatever like I'll just
not study for the test and then like
wait that's actually thorough class and
it's so that's my GPA but yes so that is
pretty much a rundown on residual I know
it sounds like a lot and for studying
wise it's really really hard I'm not
going to lie and I'm not going to like
sugarcoat it it is hard but it's
definitely manageable you can still have
a social life
YouTube it's like my job and I still
manage to post two times a week even
being an engineering major so that
should tell you something I can still go
out I still have my friends I definitely
am NOT like it I'm never like at home
for a whole weekend studying I would go
crazy if I did that oh there might be
some engineers I do that but I just
found a way to do my schoolwork and
study hard and
the whole life definitely don't have as
much more life as other majors I am not
putting down other majors once again
like I don't want to put down other
majors I am just saying that engineering
is a heavier workload than like a
English major or something like that you
know so it is a heavier workload not
saying it is are hard but you will be in
the library more and you will kind of
complain and be like oh my gosh that
girl was just complaining about having
to be in the library for two hours like
me in the library for two hours is
probably like a I don't even go to the
library for two hours because I'm going
there I go there for like eight hours so
it's just like you just kind of get used
to it honestly it's a lot harder than
high school but College in general is no
matter your major it's going to be
harder than high school yeah that's not
to discourage you that's basically
saying like you can do it I can do it
you guys can do it I was never like the
smartest person in high school and I'm
definitely not the smartest person he
called in to excite any means but you
can still do it and remember if you get
degrees guys I know that's like not a
good motto but it's true I had to retake
a class I've gotten scenes before like
it it's totally fine I was used to
getting all A's in high school but when
you go to college like you realize
getting a C is okay another thing I must
talk about is the I am a girl in
engineering and a lot of you guys ask it
is only guys know I think it's like
anything in general has more guys than
girls because it is an engineering
school but I have I I want to say I have
maybe like 80% guys 20% girls
engineering industrial engineering which
is mine has more girls I think because
it's less science see that is kind of
like one of the main questions like in
it because again engineering and being a
girls like not common also people are
surprised because I do YouTube videos
like I said in the beginning um
basically just balance it by writing in
your planner I highly recommend having a
planner it will keep you sane and it
will keep you organized and it won't let
you forget anything the very first week
I just write all my tests quizzes
homework assignments down right away
because your teacher gives you syllabus
with like follows everything that's to
do and everything that you have come up
at least mine do in all college so yeah
just really organization is the best I'm
not gonna so you have to stay organized
I think that's a whole other video that
I can do but just writing stuff down is
my
if saying organize so a thing I covered
mostly all of the questions I get about
engineering I hope I did because I'm not
kidding this video is sort of a question
so I hope they guys enjoyed this video
and I'm very happy that I got the film
after not being able to forever and
thank you Chris for letting me use your
camera she's sitting on the bed so how
can every right now so welcome so thank
you guys so much for watching if you
guys have any other engineering related
questions leave them in the comments
below and I will 100% answer them and
also I was trying to look up engineering
videos like to see like inspiration of
what I can talk about and there really
weren't any so I'm happy to put this
video out there so if you guys are
thinking of becoming an engineering
student I definitely think you guys can
do it
do not be paired up to court like the
load of work and like if you're not
smart enough
I would never the part of person I'm not
just saying that like you just have to
have a good work ethic you can't be an
engineering student and think that you
can not do homework or push everything
off to last minute or just study the day
before a test you can't and you will
fail if you do that it's just it's true
but it's possible and if you're
organized and actually work hard then
you can definitely do it
I promise so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video again and if you're not
subscribed please subscribe thumbs up
button some mail video requests in
comments below any questions you have
and I'll see you guys next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
