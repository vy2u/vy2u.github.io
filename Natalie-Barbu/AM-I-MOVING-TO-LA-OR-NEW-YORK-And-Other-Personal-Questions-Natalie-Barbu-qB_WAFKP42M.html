today I am filming a Q&amp;amp;A for you guys
and I am so excited to be answering all
of your asked questions
I love these videos because I just like
responding to you guys and getting a
chance for you guys to get to know me
more and I always love doing these
especially when I kind of get like a new
wave of subscribers or honestly I just
feel like I have a lot of the same
questions being asked and I just want to
do it on a video so it's the easiest way
for you guys to hear my answers if you
guys are new to this channel please be
sure to subscribe I really hope they get
to know me more in this video and be
sure to join the Barbie dolls and I post
videos every Tuesday and Friday so be
sure to subscribe thumbs this video up
and follow me on social media so you
guys can be a part of the next Q&amp;amp;A and
besides that let's just get into the
questions I have the questions on my
phone and I screenshotted my favorite
ones so I do not I did not get to answer
all of the questions because you guys
asked me so many but like thank you guys
so much for asking me so many questions
and for being so like responsive I guess
because I just I was so nice so I'm just
gonna answer a couple of them and a lot
of them were repeats like a lot of
people had it the same question so I'm
definitely gonna answer those in more
detail for you guys before we get the
cue and I started though I just wanted
to say that I want this to be a very
very like active comment section so
respond to any of the questions yourself
and I'm also gonna be asking you guys
some questions because I want this to be
kind of like we're having a back and
forth conversation so be sure to leave
multiple comments and answer all of the
questions so yeah I just want to be a
little more fun and for me to like
respond back and stuff like that anyways
yeah look let's get in some Q&amp;amp;A okay so
the first question is how tall are you I
have actually gotten this question a lot
and I think it's probably because I post
a lot of like alpha pictures and ever
since I've been getting more into like
fitness I'm showing you guys my fitness
videos a lot of people would just wonder
how tall I am I am only 5 3 I'm pretty
short um let me know if you thought I
was taller or shorter but yeah I'm only
5 30 I wish I wish I was taller what did
you want to be as a grown up when you
were little I love this question um so
when I was like little I had gone
through so many phases of being differ
things I first wanted to be an actress
that was like watch it before being an
actress I want to be a writer which is
weird because I don't write anymore at
all and I don't like writing but when I
was little I would always like write
books and like chapter books and I was
obsessed with reading and I just wanted
to be a writer and an author and I would
write out like books and stories and I
would read them out to my family at the
cabin wall sit in a room and I'd read by
like first chapter or whatever and like
always write these novels and I play
with Barbie dolls a lot and I think
that's kind of where I got the ideas for
my books in my head because I'd like
make out the scenes with the Barbies
after that I want to be an actress so I
did acting for like I wouldn't say maybe
like four years I actually went to LA
once or twice for acting I went on a
bunch of auditions I was once super
close to moving to LA for pilot season
and I my parents just like we're baby if
he owned it and they didn't think that
they wanted to raise me because I was so
young
in Hollywood and like split our family
apart to be like half on the west coast
half on the East Coast so they actually
turned it down but that was one thing so
who knows maybe it could have been an
actress actress is definitely there for
a long time though is it hard to be
friends with people that do not have the
same faith as you so this one I want to
answer because I feel like I talked
about my faith a lot on this channel and
you guys really are supportive about it
so thank you for that um but for me
personally I have a lot of friends that
are not the same faith as me and then I
have a lot of friends that are the same
faith as me so we're all kind of
honoring different walks of faith but I
do find it easier to be friends with
people that have the same faith as you
because then you guys have more in
common especially in relationships and
with like best best friends it is easier
in my opinion just because you guys are
on the same page you're not like iffy on
certain issues or it doesn't have like
awkward conversations but I definitely
am friends with people who are not
Christian or who are not like guests on
the same walk as we-well cross the board
it's easier for me to have someone that
has the same beliefs as me and on the
same issues but of course I am not only
friends with those people and I don't
think there's anything wrong with being
friends with people with different
faiths as you it's just to make sure
that you stand your ground and that is
when it becomes easier for me to be have
your closest circle be people that you
have the most
common with but I think that's also just
with anything like if you are a super
like active healthy fit person and you
want to be friends with people that
motivate you and encourage you you're
not gonna be friends with someone who's
like not motivating you and encouraging
you and doesn't really understand that
lifestyle I know that's a more shallow
way to put it but it's kind of the same
thing are with YouTube a lot of
youtubers are friends with other
youtubers because it's just easier
because they understand each other they
get the whole YouTube life they get
vlogging in public they get all of that
that's a lot easier to make friends with
someone that is in the same industry as
you so that's a better way of putting it
and explaining it it's not like
youtubers aren't friends with other
youtubers but it's easier when they're
best friends get them next question is
how did you meet your boyfriend and this
one is actually a long story I mean it's
not a long sort of having met like we
weren't friends in high school
so we've like known each other since
high school but we did not date in high
school but it was just kind of like a
funny and now it's funny cut up a little
bit dramatic when we first started
dating because it was a little
controversial I guess I don't really
want to dive into it on this on this
video but yeah just we had very mutual
friends and I had a previous boyfriend
and I don't know it was just a little
bit of dramatic kind of not anymore but
whatever those are get to know me and
like personally and know this or you
guys everybody like oh my god but you
guys my whole like boyfriend video or
like where I actually have him sit down
and like talk like a boyfriend tag ish I
don't really like boyfriend time so it's
something like that on his channel give
this video a thumbs up and let me know
and comment down below how you think
that we started dating I don't know I
think they'll be fun to see your
thoughts not a bad thing it's just it's
just it's funny looking back the next
question is has being a female impact to
you at all in pursuing or majoring in
engineering I love your videos I
actually got two comments on this
another one was have I ever experienced
sexism as a female in engineering my
honest answers no I really really have
not experienced any sexism at all all of
my colleagues and all of the people that
I go to school with they're all super
like
they're totally I mean honestly they
probably like that they have girls in
their classes if anything but I've never
been told like I'm dumb or I'm like not
good enough for anything because I'm a
female in engineering so yeah I've never
experienced any of it and I'm so
thankful for that I probably the place
where I have experienced the most sexism
and the most where I have felt impacted
for being a female in engineering is on
the comments section on my YouTube
videos and I'm sure that there will be
some comments on this video even two but
especially on engineering related ones I
mean the rudest men and probably the men
that have like literally living in their
mom's basement in their boxers watching
my video on YouTube have nothing better
than to do then to put me down and to
comment me things those are rare
experience and most like hate for being
a girl in engineering but honestly I'm
just like okay what are you doing with
your life like why are you watching a 21
year old girl see YouTube videos as like
a grown-ass man like I'm sorry but that
to me is like kind of pathetic on their
part so I don't really let it get to me
because obviously you have nothing
better to do in the middle of the day
then to comment on my photo or my
Instagram and have like hate because I'm
a girl and engineering the next question
is what's your favorite thing about
being a youtuber my favorite thing about
being a youtuber is the fact that I get
to do what I love and every single day
like whether it's I get to take you guys
along with my day and vlog whether I get
to sit down and film a video like this
like I am happy right now filming this
video I'm happy when I have my blog
camera it just has brought me so many
more friends and I'm not talking about
like other youtuber friends which that
too it definitely has but just like you
guys on the Internet today I actually
ran into someone on campus
her name is Haley shoutout to you the
cam to me was like oh do you do the
YouTube videos like I love your videos
and then she DM me and it was just so
nice like that literally was the
highlight of my day and it's only
whatever like 2 o'clock right now so
things like that just like make me so
happy and whenever I read the comment
saying that like this video help me out
or this video like you're my inspiration
like I don't know what I did to deserve
that because I feel like I'm just such
like I look up to people on YouTube and
I'm like there's no way I'm like them
but
it's just really cool seeing that other
people are impacted by your words and
your videos and you can actually
encourage and motivate people even if
you don't live on the same like country
even you know so that's like my favorite
part next question is how do you battle
insecurity I just always remember if I'm
taking out a time out of my day to call
myself fat and ugly and gross and just
feeling down about myself that's
literally not gonna achieve anything
except make me feel worse and not
improve any part of my life so when I'm
feeling insecure I remind myself of
everything that I love and positive
things about me or just positive like go
and do something that I love like I'll
pick up my blog camera and vlog which is
kind of ironic because if I'm feeling
you would think if I'm feeling like
gross and ugly I don't want to vlog but
it's kind of office X I'm like okay I
just want to like hang out with someone
right now and that happens to my camera
and that happens to me you guys but I'll
just start doing things that I love what
sort of thinking a positive things I'll
start reading your comments for example
and that just like puts me in a better
mood and then I actually try to like be
productive with my day so if I am
feeling gross and stuff I'm like okay
well at least let me get stuff done I
don't know if that makes sense but I
kind of battle insecurities by like
kicking it in the butt and being like
okay I don't even have time to think
about those insecure thoughts I'm just
gonna go and like do work or do
something to better myself the next
question is what are your plans after
college with your youtube career and
then another question is what are some
goals that you have as your YouTube
channel for this year do you see
yourself living in New York or LA within
the next few years so I'm gonna put
those two together just because I feel
like they are similar most of you guys
know I have a job lined up after college
it's in North Carolina it's in my
hometown of Charlotte North Carolina so
I will be moving back there when that
job starts which I don't know when it
starts yet but I know I am going to have
that summer to do whatever I want I am
actually planning on something really
big this summer and I'm excited and I
would love for you guys keep me in your
prayers if you can and also I'm excited
for just to like let you guys know what
I'm doing this summer where I will be
living this summer and if you guys have
any guesses
comment down below but I'm not
gonna be home this summer I'll say that
most likely 99% sure I will not be in
North Carolina I will be in another
parts and it's gonna be it's gonna be
exciting I'm really excited about it as
for what are my plans in my youtube
career I'm 1,000,000% going to be doing
it when I have my job like you guys keep
me saying you guys keep me happy again
you guys are my friends I can't just
like turn that off so I will be doing it
um filming my I have to cut short to
like once a week versus twice a week but
for sure it's still gonna be uploading
at least once a week probably get more
into vlogging like before and after work
during work hours but doing more things
like that and just showing you guys more
of my life and I'm really really excited
about it so yeah don't worry my youtube
channel will not change when I leave
college what inspired you to start
YouTube and what made you stick to it
when you didn't have an audience and
another question is tips for good
filming vlogging new youtubers how about
how to manage time in YouTube and
college and then another one was I
stutter and I want to make a youtube
channel should I start my own YouTube
channel any tips okay those questions
are all about how to start your own
YouTube channel if you guys want me to
do a whole video on that I do have one
but if you guys want me to do an update
one with my new tips on it let me know
down below and give this video a thumbs
up but but for me my biggest tips is for
when you don't have an audience just
remember literally no one had an
audience when they first started no one
starts a YouTube channel and
automatically 100,000 subscribers like
you have to work for it and you have to
earn it
for me what motivated me is not because
like yes I love you guys and I love
having you like talking to you and
everything like that makes me happy that
makes me want to keep going and stuff
but obviously when I first started I
didn't have that I love filming videos
and being having my creative SIA
on the internet and editing and filming
and coming up with new ideas and stuff
like that so like I truly do love it if
you're only doing it because you want to
get famous
tough luck like good luck to you but
like you're probably not going to be as
successful and you're probably not gonna
like it and then people will see right
for you so many of my friends that are
like oh I would love to do a YouTube
channel but like I know no one would
watch my videos well yeah no one's gonna
watch your videos if you're going in
with that attitude
and I kind of just like I don't know I
went into it thinking not thinking it
would be this big of a thing as it is
now like I didn't think I could ever
make it my job so I think that's awesome
that I'm doing that right now in college
like I don't have to have a part-time
job because this is my full-time job but
I definitely started off just because I
truly did love it like I loved filling
outfit videos and makeup videos and
everything like that like that was my
getaway that was my outlet I didn't
think it would make me famous but I do
encourage everyone who wants to start a
YouTube channel to start a YouTube
channel and not be focused on the
numbers because that's just not gonna
make you happy like never look even now
like yes I just hit 100,000 but if I was
so caught up in the numbers I would be
bummed that I didn't hit a million you
know and like yes I would love to hit a
million but that's not why I do this and
I don't do YouTube so I can one day hit
a million subscribers I do it because I
love it and the fact that I might get 1
million subscribers is a huge perk and
like amazing but that's not why I do it
that is it for the questions today
because this video is getting super
super long but I really hope that you
guys enjoyed this video and let me know
what you guys thought in the comments
below let me know what other videos you
guys want me to watch and follow me on
Instagram and Twitter so you guys can be
involved in the next QA but I love you
guys so much and I will see you guys on
Friday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
