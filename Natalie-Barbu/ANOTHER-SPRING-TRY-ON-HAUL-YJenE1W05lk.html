today i am filming another haul video
and i'm honestly kind of embarrassed
saying that i'm filming another haul
video because the last 1i films was only
like a week or two ago and it was a lot
of stuff and the fact that i have more
stuff to put in a hall it's also kind of
embarrassing but you guys really like
haul videos and i love filming them and
this one is actually going to be a try
on one I don't have a lot of clothes I
don't have like a ton ton of clothes but
I do have a lot of random things and I
thought it might be cool to kind of
shift away from just clothes and just
gonna show you everything that I've
bought in the past like two weeks and
yeah my mom came to visit me at school
so normally when my mom comes we like go
shopping and stuff so that it's
partially definitely mainly to blame for
all of this stuff so the first where i'm
going to show you is target and i got a
lot of random things from target so bear
with me this stuff is just kind of
random so not just clothes but it is
pretty interesting so the first season i
bought is coconut oil yes this is not a
supermarket halt but i am excited to use
coconut oil for my hair if i get good
results i'm definitely going to be
sharing with you guys on like social
media and stuff if i really like it but
if any of you guys have tried coconut
oil and put it in your hair let me know
next thing that I got is shaving cream
guys I I don't know why I'm showing you
guys all this I just thought I don't
know let me know if you guys like me
showing you guys like the normal things
that i buy because i think it's kind of
interesting like I don't know rigsy more
like like we're friends like hey guys
like I just want shaving cream I don't
know do you say that to your friends I
yes the next thing that I bought is a
body scrub and I'm excited to try this
one because it is st. Ives and I use
this one on my face and the fact that
i'm using out my body now makes me
really happy because i love this one and
I'm starting to self tan as you guys
will be able to see and um yeah so I
really wanted something to exfoliate my
body cuz that's
really really good and loofahs like
collected skin cells or dead skin and um
it's like not that sand health like
salmon Sam sanitary smell that sanitary
that's that's sort of looking for the
next thing that I brought from target is
this water bottle it's not really a
water bottle but it's just a liquid
bottle thing milk bottle is actually
what it is I will be drinking my iced
coffee in this because when I go to
class and I ain't want iced coffee I
don't have anything to take with me and
just quickly like put it my backpack so
this will be perfect for that so cute
two guys took a little milk jug so cute
now on to something a little more
exciting I got these shoes from target
and target has the cutest shoes I'm
telling you guys it's we're twenty-five
dollars so they were very expensive
compared to department stores and this
is what they look like I don't have very
many black summer sandals so I was
really stoked when I saw these at target
and yeah I'm like seeing it love with
these I think they're so cute the next
thing that I got from target is this rum
/ and I think it is adorable it is just
this black rubber with like paisley
print on it black and white and then it
has a tie at the waist and it's just a
high neck rhombur the next door that I
shopped at is urban outfitters and I am
really excited to show you guys so the
first thing that I got it's just this
plane tank top those are you guys have
been with me for a long time know how
much i am into basics so i just got this
basic a white tank top i really liked
the cut of it though it was really flowy
and i think with a bralette this would
be so cute or with a normal bra I don't
know I really really just like the cut
this is perfect for the summer just a
basic outfit or also going out you can
dress it up with some necklaces and the
next thing that I got is this long
jumper that I think I'm going to wear
for my formal normally for formals like
sorority formals you wear maxi dresses
or kind of like something similar to
prom but I think I want to be a little
more different and wear a jumpsuit which
there's probably going to be difficult
girl wearing jumpsuits but I'm really
excited to wear this one so it's more
casual but I'm really not into like the
sequins and all that stuff so it is this
very very beautiful jumpsuit it's black
and it has
print on it and it goes all the way down
to the floor it's very long and then I
really like because it's a halter so it
ties up here and it's like a braided tie
which i think is so cute how cute is
that and then it has a low back so I am
obsessed with this rubber or jumper and
jumpsuit whatever and I am very very
excited to my upper formal and yeah so
let me know fears like this because I am
in love with this and I really like
being a little bit more casual than more
dressy the next thing I got was from
Nordstrom and I got some shoes from
there so the first pair of shoes that I
got were these lace-up pointy flats and
these are super in right now they lace
up at your kind of like on your ankle a
little bit above your ankle they like
crisscross and tie and they are halogen
and I think they're so comfortable
they're so cute I'm in love with these
like just ballerina slippers but I
really like the pointy toe and normally
don't like pointy toes i really like the
Medicis and then the next pair of shoes
I got where these just plain tan flats
from sam edelman I actually have an
internship this summer so I am so
excited that I have an internship this
summer it's at a it's at Ralph Lauren
distribution warehouse so that is really
exciting because it's fashion and
engineering which is like literally how
much more perfect and it get and since
the summer and I can't wear open-toed
shoes or heels so these are definitely
gonna be my go to work shoes the next
thing that I got is from my favorite
store I love it so much and it's from
free people I actually only got one
necklace because Chloe got the other
ones so I only have one with me right
now but it's in the one necklace that I
got is literally so gorgeous I am in
love with this necklace you guys it is
just I kind of like a choker at the top
because it comes up super high and then
it is this like piece of arch that I
want hanging on my wall so I'm probably
gonna do that the next thing I got is
from wrong way and it is this really
really cool dress okay so this dress is
so cool like I
I think it's the launch of pocahontas
back in the day is so cool it's
definitely given me Coachella vibes if I
go to a musical school I totally want to
wear that but I think you'll be cute in
the summer with like booties and a hat
and it looks costing me on the hanger
but on I think it's really really cool
and I think everyone will be asked me
where you got it and the material is so
soft and suede and i love it and it is
so extremely cheap so check out i will
have it linked down below as little
everything are all these clothing items
i will have down below as well the next
thing that I got is makeup for sephora i
have not done it a makeup haul in what
seems like five years or something like
that so i am really excited guys I out
from Sephora because i love Sephora so
the first thing that I got kind of goes
back to why I got the exfoliating scrub
from target and is because i want to
start self tanning I'm use this last
summer but it is at my house in um not
at school so I'm going to be using this
at school and I got the MIT to go with
it because that's how you apply it and
this is definitely my favorite favorite
self-tanner if you guys want a
self-tanning routine once I am tan and
not like this then let me know because i
will show you guys but yeah I use
bronzing mousse and I use the darker one
because i have just a darker skin tone
naturally and it is like so natural and
it doesn't smell and not shrinking and
it's just the greatest self-tanner in
the world next thing I got from Sephora
is this matchbox full exposure palette
I'm very very late to the game I realize
people I've had this for years but i
just think these colors are beautiful
and i really wanted some matte colors
because i have all of the naked palettes
about all the negative pallets of really
really shimmery colors and i just wanted
some matte colors so i got this one then
i think i got at sephora is this Daisy
perfume this is my favorite perfume in
the world I always go back to it I wish
you could smell things through the
camera because it smells so so good I
always go back to this and then I run
out and then i buy another one and then
I go back to this so every other perfume
I basically buy this one just because is
the best thing I've ever smelled in my
whole leg I mean I'm not exaggerate
you guys you might think it's an
exaggerated of statement but to me this
is what heaven will smell like like it's
this i think that i got from sephora is
this super cute macaroon lip balm i
don't know whose map it on or macaroon
if you guys know what the correct thing
is please let me know because it could
be both I've heard both but this is what
it looks like when I saw it at Sephora
at first I was really really confused
and I was like wait why are they selling
macaroons like are these for me to eat
because they look really real but you
toast it mmmn it seems a great look
straight up grape and then it's just a
lip balm and I'm now capita on my lips
right now just because i have a lipstick
and stuff on but it is amazing like oh
my gosh how cute is the packaging when
people think i'm carrying around a real
life macaroon migrant member and i don't
know guys please inform me and educate
me last thing that i got support over
these face mask things not face mask
vitamin-enriched face base and i love
the I be member i think that's what it
is v ID number was sephora so i have
like a ton of points like honestly I'm
embarrassed to say how many points I
have so I'm not going to say it but it's
a lot so I always get those little
things at the register because i had
like so many points and so i decided to
pick up one of these Bobby Brown face
space is and it took a moisturizer but
also kind of a face primer so I'm really
excited to try it because it feels so
good on my hands when I did the tester
so I can only imagine how good it feels
on your face next thing is what I am
most excited to show you guys I saved
the best for last so if you're still
