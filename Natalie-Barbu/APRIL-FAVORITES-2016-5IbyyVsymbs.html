filming my April favorites video which
is so weird because it is the end of
april which means that i am officially
on summer almost so not officially on
summer my last exam is on thursday and
then I am done and I'm on summer
vacation so you guys don't understand
how happy that makes me but also how sad
that makes me because that means i am
halfway done with college and i just
don't really know how to process that so
it's very very weird if you are new to
this channel please subscribe if you
guys want to you would just be notified
every time I post a video I feel like
everyone knows what hitting the
subscribe button does but I don't know i
feel like i should clarify that for you
and make sure that you get this video up
if you are so excited for summer because
I'm just like over the moon so happy
that it is summer and I don't have too
many favorites but all of these I don't
think you guys have seen in a video
before and I am so excited to show you
guys because I am in absolutely loving
these products and it would be a shame
for me and not to share them with you
but I feel like they are a little bit
different but yeah I'm just going to hop
right into the video so starting out
with makeup the first thing that I want
to show you guys is my Smashbox palette
this is the full exposure palette by
Smashbox a lot of people have this you
guys have seen this in my prom makeup
tutorial if you guys watch that but yeah
I just really like it because it has a
lot of matts colors and it has a lot of
shimmery colors versus urban decay naked
palettes only have shimmery colors with
maybe like one or two bad ones literally
the best I think that this is better
than the make
pallets and i never thought i would say
that I used to love the naked palettes
and I still do but I have been
definitely reaching for this more than
any of my naked palettes my next makeup
favorite is this bobby brown face base i
think that's what's called it's a
vitamin enriched face base so basically
what it is it doubles it's a moisturizer
and a primer I always moisturize my face
before I put this on but it also really
does like moisturize your face and helps
your makeup stay on all day and is the
only primer that doesn't break me out
and it actually does moisturize and it
just leaves your skin feeling and
looking so nice sometimes when I don't
wear makeup I just put this on because
it really makes my skin look so so
amazing but I definitely go the song
before I put on any makeup but yeah it
smells really good it has a lot of good
things for your skin my next favorite
makeup item is this brush and these are
one of the spoon looking brushes
everyone thinks it's a spoon when you
first show them but basically this one
is from Mac so it is not the original
one that everyone has the big silver one
I like this sighs I think it's good for
like in between like your nose and areas
that are hard to reach I feel like the
big brush with me just really hard to
get into those small areas but yeah I
basically just put my foundation on and
rub it in like this and I'm done in like
30 seconds and it makes it look like it
is airbrush on my face I've definitely
been using this more than the beauty
blender because Beauty blenders absorb a
lot of foundation and I would like to
use as little product as I can for the
maximum amount of coverage so that is
what I feel this one is better at doing
that than the ed blender just saying
guys I know everyone's such a beauty
blender lover but I really do think this
is better than the Beauty Blender you
know I'm going to be going into kind of
like grooming items I guess not really
make up but not close either just things
i use in the bathroom if that makes
sense so the first one is kind of weird
it is men's deodorant and i use in
gillette high performance sport training
day invisible solid yeah this is the one
I use it smells like a boy and I
absolutely love the white boys smell it
smells like Cologne it's so good so yeah
I've been using this na honestly last
like it's way better than girl do der
and I girl do you ready to step it up
because whenever I wear girl deodorant I
feel like it does absolutely nothing for
me but this one I do not sweat when I
have this and I work out a lot with like
I puts on before I work out and make my
underarms do not sweat I feel like I
don't know that afterwards either I know
this is like kind of weird to talk about
but yeah so I don't like that guides you
in right is a lot better and it is a lot
cheaper if you guys know that or not a
lot cheaper but maybe like a couple of
seven guys that's cheaper or something
like that so I'm not a lot cheaper but
over time it will add up and yeah I
don't know why I do der is cheaper than
girl deodorant but it works better so
like I'm not really like whatever I
don't care I don't even want you to
scroll together anymore but I dug like
don't need you anymore the next grooming
type thing is this shaving cream and I
showed you guys this in one of my halls
it's called wish shave cream and oh my
gosh you guys I don't think I never
found a shave cream that I love more
than this one before I used to use
shaving creams I just use water and like
my legs would always get scratched up
and stuff like that my legs were super
super like not soft they were really
really rough and this I swear like
prevents me from shaving like I think
Ely helps my leg hair not grow as fast
if that's possible and it smells so so
good and it leaves my skin so soft I
never want to have another shaving cream
again because i feel like i don't need
it I need to shave it once a week with
that shaving cream I am not kidding you
guys it is like I don't know what's in
it the next thing I could not include I
cannot not include this in this video is
like coconut oil I just got this from
Toria it shows organic virgin coconut
oil unrefined medium heat basically what
you use to cook except I have never
cooked with this I base
they just put it all over my body before
I go to bed especially my legs I put it
on my legs after i shower before i go to
sleep and if i have a super dry patches
i will cement this on and i also put
this in my hair as a leave-in
conditioner i put like barely any
between my fingertips and just put it at
the ends as a leave-in conditioner and
then also as a hair mask i use this and
i'ma solve it into my roots and then i
put it all they like throughout my whole
hair and I'm not getting my hair has
been growing like tremendously and i
only use this a few times i'm like five
times as a hair mask and it's grown like
a significant amount and also my hair
has been so much softer which it used to
not be very soft used to kind of feel
like a broomstick at the ends and now it
is so soft and there's like research
that if you eat two tablespoons of
coconut oil a day then your waist
becomes smaller like two weeks it's been
proven that your waist becomes smaller
so i'm about to start eating coconut oil
see how that like transforms my body to
but yeah it is like a magical thing a
magical food that you can use literally
everywhere like hair body nails um
whatever like literally anywhere you can
cook with it like anti cooking's or anti
stick spray I have coconut oil anti
stick spray like coconut oil is just
taking over the world and I am a hundred
percent okay with it the next thing is
clothing items which is my favorite and
surprisingly i do not have have any
clothing items but the first thing i
will show you guys is just t shirts i
want to see them just loving like big
old t-shirts i know it's super weird
this is one that i have purchased it's
just a nike track and field plain black
just kind of loose big t-shirt and i
really really like it i got this at
goodwill for about three dollars and
goodwill has a lot of stuff like this
like just like old guy t-shirts I've
been really looking I wore this is high
waisted shorts and um like sneakers and
yeah and I go to sleep with it to just I
just been really loving looking at kind
of not all put together but still like
not like a slob either I don't really
like a big t-shirt sneakers and like up
will arm the green jacket or something
like that I wore a choker and my
sunglasses with it like it looked really
cool so I don't know I just like have
been liking that and also good news is
that you can get it for totally shaped
like I said that was from Goodwill three
dollars yeah you can literally just
going to interest or look through the
t-shirt section and they're super cheap
and you definitely can find some good
things I know goodwill is very hit or
miss but if you have patience and look
through the things they are like there's
a lot of cool things that no one else
will have so yeah pretty cool the next
clothing item that I beloved is baseball
caps this one specifically it is from a
Windsor store I showed it in a hall and
I don't want to mess it mess up my hair
and put it on now but yeah so this is
just the faux leather baseball cap and
then the this part of it is actually
just like cloth material like baseball
cap material but this is a leather and
it is so cool-looking I absolutely love
it whenever I have a bad hair day I just
throw out a baseball cap this one is
very universal you can literally buy it
like wherever you want I will have it
everything linked down below that I can
find and yeah this is just like my
favorite baseball cap i also have one
from NC State which is school I go to
just like bring any sort of a smoke up
like whatever you have a bad day i think
is a really it's a look right now and
I'm digging the look my and next
clothing item that is a favor to mine
having these adidas shoes I don't know
if I showed me the video before but I
wear them I think every day five times a
week at least I wear them so often they
literally go with everything that I want
to wear and they're just like such comfy
shoes i recommend going two sizes
smaller i'm normally like a seven and a
half or no I'm only 27 and I had to get
a size five and a half so go a one and a
half sizes smaller because they run a
huge like five and a half it's me and
I'm normally a seven like that shouldn't
be but yeah and they're actually not
that dirty so that's pretty good for the
amount i wear them like they're still
pretty white like so then the two of
miscellaneous items that i have number
one is this candle and it is French cade
lavender in his from anthropology but
I've seen it
many other stores it's by the brand
volusia so you can get these wherever
they sell loses basically just smells
like a boy and if you didn't know from
my deodorant I absolutely love the way
boys smell they shouldn't oh not only be
reserved for boys they should that smell
should just be everywhere I think so
yeah this is it smells like Cologne and
it's also good and it's like a really
really pretty candle too so lastly at my
favorite for this a miscellaneous
category is this book me before you I
know the movie is coming out so that is
what the cover is but yeah the movies
going out so I want to read the book
beforehand I love reading and I just
picked this book up I'm only halfway
done with it but I cannot put it down it
is so so good and I know I'm going to be
heartbroken and saw my eyes out at the
end but like I'm accepting that getting
it ready so yeah so what I have been
loving this book I have not been a strip
of the fact that it's already in my
favorites kind of shows a lot but I
really am wanting to read a nonfiction
book that's just kind of make me think
and maybe have my mind blown so if you
