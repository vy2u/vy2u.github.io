favorites video and I am so excited to
do this video because i did not do a
March favorites and that was because I
didn't really have any more to favorites
I was kind of just using the same things
I've been using all of the other months
and I figured it'd be really boring and
a waste of time to do that video because
you guys wouldn't have seen anything new
and literally be the same things every
weary but now I have discovered some new
products that I've been loving in the
month of April the month of April was a
pretty good month for me because I had
my spring break which is always fun that
it was my birthday um yeah I was just a
pretty good month for me um and so I'm
just going to show you all of my
favorite my first favorite has been
featured in many many favorites videos
before except not in the winter really
into my hoola bronzer but now since i
did get a bit more tan during spring
break and sunburned if you guys saw my
ass nollie video i was like a lobster I
know um this is what it looks like
though it's just like a matte brown
color i'm not sure if you didn't pick it
up that well but um i love it i read it
all over my face sometimes i just kick
foundation because i don't really need
it so my my skin's not acting up or
anything so let's get foundation but i
will apply my bronzer because my face is
a lot paler than my body because i put
sunscreen all over my face every single
day but like obviously i got summer and
I didn't put sunscreen on my body so
stupid like that but I don't recommend i
recommend you buy sunscreen everyday um
but yeah hoola bronzer best films are
ever and this is the same browser that
has been featured in all my favorites
videos like the same exact one I haven't
purchased a new one and I wear it every
single day so you guys can tell that is
long lasting and amazing my next product
is this Maybelline blush it's in the
color I don't know what color this is in
pink peony thick it's in the color pink
peony and this is what it looks like and
it's a matte kind of like light light
pink / neutral like skin color type I
don't know if you guys can see that um
it's not that like it's really
but I like wearing it under a blush I
think it just makes it kind of the blush
be bit more like nicer my desk I don't
know how what it does or how I would
describe it i just love wearing it under
my blush i do wear this blush sometimes
alone but that's really when i'm trying
to go for the no-makeup look this is
great if you're trying to go for no
makeup cuz it's not that strong it's not
that pigmented but under a regular blush
it looks really good in a kind of risk
of base for that blush I guess that's a
better word for it my next thing that I
have been loving is my naked 2 palette
yes I caved in and I got it I convinced
my mom to let me get it that's what it
looks like and I like it because it came
with a lip gloss that's actually a
really pretty lip gloss and then it came
with this boom brush and for it one side
it's a flat shader brush and the other
side it's a crease brush and I normally
just use this brush when i'm applying
the Naked palette because I feel like
it's just easier because I'm going to
bring one thing you know associate
sleepovers don't just bring this and
that's pretty much it um and these are
the colors so it has kind of the similar
colors to the naked one palette but it's
still a bit different because um if you
look at them side-by-side it's kind of
different but I really really like it
i've been using all of these colors so
much and I feel like you can use every
single one of these colors on a daily
basis except the spark one this black
one I definitely don't recommend using
on a daily basis but every single other
one of these colors if you apply with a
light hand you can use it every day my
next favorite are two mascaras this one
I'm so excited for its the Hypnose doll
lashes mascara this is what the case
looks like it is the greatest mascara
I've ever tried in my life every single
other mascara does not stay put the
whole day or it doesn't stay the curl
the whole day this one it looks the same
when i get home from school looks the
same at the end of the night i love it
so much i will never buy another mascara
I don't I mean I know it's pricey but it
is so worth it you guys it's the best
mascara ever and its land called all
Hypnose doll lashes it is so good like I
am obsessed with this mascara and I um
put that one on first and then for my
second coat I put lash blast volume
which I like this as a second coat it
just gives me that extra like a volume
and it these two together work amazing
my next favorite is this concealer it's
the instant age rewind by Maybelline um
this is what it looks like and obviously
I don't have wrinkles so I'm not using
it for wrinkles it's just a really good
concealer for under eye circles and kind
of I kind of do it on my dark spots too
oh i don't think i would recommend this
if you have heavy under-eye circles I
barely have any under eye circles like I
have a little bit because I'd never get
any sleep like last two weeks ago the
earliest i went to bed was 130 and that
was a school week like I don't sleep so
um this is my favorite concealer at the
moment I don't have that bad up under
eye circles but I'm starting to get a
little bit more and this has been
working really well and this literally
fits the exact skin tone of mine like
it's exact I've never found a better
match I'm in the color 30 medium um it
is awesome my next favorite is this Mac
um fluid line and it's in the color dark
diversion and I've been really loving
purple lately I'm wearing it today it's
this deep purple I don't know if you
could tell because of the sunlight but
it's just a really deep purple and I've
been loving it and it's kind of like a
purple brown I think it just looks
really pretty on the lids or on the
upper lash line and my last makeup
product is this rosebud minted rose um
lip balm or actually I don't know if
it's rosebud it's Smith's minted rose
lip balm this is what it looks like and
I've never had a better chapstick before
it works so well I was in New York for
spring break and my lips were really
chapped and so I went to Sephora and I
was like what's your best um lip balm
and Matt first they pointed me to sugar
or fresh sugar I think it's what it's
called and it's this little and I was
like okay I'll try it out then I looks
at the prize and was 22 dollars for a
lip balm like I'm not gonna make $22
rear lip balm sorry Sephora so I decided
to pick this one up instead bees and I
think it was like nine dollars maybe 06
and I have I actually picked up a sample
because it was my birthday so they sent
me a like a free sugar free duo of the
sugar
fresh sugar lip balm things so i got
like too many ones for my birthday and I
mean the sugar one look works well but
it's definitely nowhere near as good as
this one so I think either the Sephora
person just was biased towards that
which is totally fine because I'm biased
towards so many different brands but um
or she just wanted to make me pay $23 or
something I don't know but I was not
gonna pay twenty bucks for lip balm but
I'm yeah so I got this and it is amazing
and I wear all the time and then I have
two hair products left for you guys and
that's it for my favorites so it's not
that long ago a video I don't think um
the first hair favorite of mine is this
bed head after parties smoothing cream
for silky shiny looking hair this
literally makes your hair completely
different in a good way like anything
wrong with your hair even if it's
flyaways even if it's just like looking
bad which is you're in a bad hair day
just put this on your hair and eat we'll
make it look good look I love this and I
had this again also for a really long
time it's just been stuffed under my
drawer like I don't know what to use it
you know so I finally used it when I had
my hair like wavy and eight works so
well I use it when I straighten my hair
like I straighten my hair today so well
I just use it all the time and it's just
so good and it's not greasy at all and
it smells like the smell of this I've
never smell anything better it smells
like um curls rock and i have used curls
rock before and that is also really good
bennett is probably my favorite on hair
hair brand out there like out of
everybody i love all of the bedhead
products but um yeah so this is amazing
if in case you guys are looking for any
like breakthroughs for the hair or
something it works really well and then
this joico split and meander is a
miracle baby who i love it so much
literally guys i don't really have that
many split ends and I swear it is I owe
it all to this thing I put this in every
single time I shower so after I shower I
put this in all over my ends of my hair
so I just take it and I focus more on
the ends of my hair but I also kind of
go along right here and I don't go above
my ear cuz I my hair will just be crazy
but I go kind of down here too just
because i do have layers so that
like I do i may get split ends right
here too so then i add like the rest of
my right there but i do focus more on
the ends and it is amazing i don't get
split ends anymore and I show you my
hair I curl my hair like it's just so
well so this is not a heat protectant
I'm mistaken for that it is a split end
meander so it's gonna mend your split
ends in case you guys don't know what
that means but yeah it is awesome and
that was it for my favorites video so
