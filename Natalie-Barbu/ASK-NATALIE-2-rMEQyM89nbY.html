filling filming filming not filling I'm
going to be filming my ask a Natalie
video and this is the second ask Natalie
that I've ever done and I really love
Tim use it is just cuz I really like
talk me guys about just like random
stuff even if it does include like a
little bit of fashion of maybe I just
really love talking to you guys about
just like my life I guess I don't know
so um yeah I'm just going to get started
and I have my love right here and I will
be reading all the questions that you
asked me in my tumblr so here we go um
when are you going to start making
regular videos like you used to
oh and do you still love one direction
anonymous asked that and um I am so
sorry about like regular videos
everything like that like I don't want
to promise anything just cuz I'm not
really sure what I'm gonna do but this
past week I had exams and we used to be
able to exempt exams which means like if
you haven't a in the class and no more
than three absences you don't need to
take an exam and so like that always
used to apply to me because I've always
had an A and I only miss three days of
school every single semester but now
they took away exam exemptions so I have
to take all of my exams yeah and so I
was like studying like crazy like
literally every single day I was at
Starbucks studying just because I feel
like in my zone at Starbucks I can't
study at my house but yeah so I'm sorry
about that but I don't want to make any
promises so I will try coming more
regularly but I can't make any promises
my second semester is um a lot easier
though I don't really have any art
classes so yeah so that it's the answer
to that and do you still love one
direction of course I do I'm just not
like I know I'm not like obsessed with
them like I don't like posters of them
and like pictures of them on my wall or
anything like that but I do still love
them and I am going to their concert in
Raleigh in July I believe you could
change your flaws what what will it be
or would you change it so what would it
be or would you change it um I guess
like flaws appearance-wise it would
probably be like I know my skin I guess
sometimes I break out and I wish I could
have just like perfectly clear skin
right now it's pretty good but some
I can just get like gross and like I
guess I would want to be taller but I
mean I don't know it's not only like a
flaw like it's not like I don't know
like it's just kind of a trait I guess I
mean skin is a flaw but like tallness
like I don't know I guess that would be
it for physical appearances for like
internal flaws and more patience of
people kind of like watch what I say
before I actually say it I can't like
think before I speak cuz I can have like
an attitude sometimes so gotta work on
that
can you explain your haircut and hair
color um my hair guy I don't even know
how to explain it just long liars it
sort of is I got a haircut recently but
it grows super fast like it's already
kind of back to normal maybe a little
bit shorter than normal but I mean it
grows my hair grows like an inch a month
more more like it grows really fast and
my hair color I used to have with the
ombre and I still kind of have it but
when I got my hair cut I kind of took a
lot of it away I am going to dye my hair
lighter during a spring break though so
it's gonna be pretty light but not like
blonde or anything so I do not want it
to be blonde at all but yeah I'm all
show you guys a picture of what I want
like what I'm gonna show my hair lady
it's on my phone mix between this hair
color and I do not know who this is but
she's so pretty
and I like how it's a bit darker at the
roots if you can see and a mix between
this color natalie portman so those two
colors are what i'm going to show my
hair lady and that's what i'm going to
do during spring so i will do a video
showing you guys how it turns 'ok are
you loving right now so right now i'm
really into just kind of like the
Lumineers that's like one of my
favorites a Lana Del Rey I love her I've
been listening just to those two
Lumineers in Lana Del Rey like 24/7 so
those two are my top favorite what is it
like being a member of the 17th style
council and what are they ask you to do
okay so I am NOT a member anymore just
because it was only for 2012 but it was
the best opportunity I've ever had in my
life
it was so much fun the experience was
incredible and they have already chosen
the 2013 style council members so if you
want to you can apply for next series
around
September but um yeah so I just kind of
blocked for them sometimes they sent me
to New York to do photo shoots I would
always have to be taking pictures and
sending them in and yeah but it was just
like so much fun and it wasn't like it
was just awesome I really really loved
it you ever do a closet or for us what
are you looking forward to this year
what do you want to do when you leave
for school are you going to any concerts
to see or one direction what do you
think the big big upcoming trends wow

um
so will you ever do a closet tour for us
I will but not in this house I've
already told you guys I don't really
like like this house isn't anything
special it's just kind of like my closet

so no not in this house but I will do it
when I move into my next house um what
are you looking forward to this year um

big upcoming trends are okay so this
sounds terrible but I have not really
read any fashion magazines lately but
for upcoming trends I honestly don't you
know like that's terrible mostly like
into fashion but I've just kind of been
doing my own thing right now just just
in that casual I guess I think it's
to be very similar to last year but I
will let you guys know on a video next
time when I actually start like picking
up a magazine and see looks like in I
guess how do you get your eyebrows so
perfect oh my goodness my eyebrows are
not perfect I just got them done
recently but I'm trying like picking
them out a little bit so in the summer
they were a lot thicker not like thickly
oh hey guys you just have a bush on my
face like but just like a little lime
thicker maybe if you look like two
pictures and like on my Instagram of me
and like the summer my eyebrows were a
lot thicker and I really liked that more
but I don't know I just get them waxed
by a lady who does them for me umm do

low liar pretty little liars
