be doing a look inspired from Aria
Montgomery from Pretty Little Liars I
absolutely love that show as well as
probably every teenage girl in America
yeah me and all my friends we always
have sleepovers from Pretty Little Liars
is on we watch it every week it's just
such a good show and today I mean I just
love arias look I love her makeup her
clothes
everything so today I'm going to be
doing a look inspired by Aria and I hope
you guys enjoy
okay so first you're going to take a PI
primer I'm using Laura Mercier I think
this is in the color of flecks you're
just going to put it all over your eye
all the way to the brow bone because we
will be using colors all the way up to
there okay after that we're going to be
taking on this Mac shadow in color arena
it's a just a really pretty um it's more
like orange like sandy gold kind of
color and we're just going to be taking
a Mac 239 brush it's just a flat brush I
line it all over my hand and just take
some tap off the excess and just pack it
on the lid it's a really pretty color
for your lid just put a little bit more
on do that you're going to take this Mac
color and all that glitters it's
probably my favorite color ever for eyes
and you're going to take your Mac crease
crease crease brush in mat 222 just
wiggle it tap off any excess and just
put just very little in your crease you
don't want this to take up your whole
crease because we will be adding another
color okay
there that's good and then you're going
to take this color in texture it's a
really pretty it's just like a matte
light brown 1g
take the same crease brush and just put
it then you're going to take a gel liner
I'm using Bobbi Brown in the color
caviar ink number 27 so really pretty
black but it's not too harsh and I'm
going to be taking my Bobbi Brown ultra
fine liner brush it's really nice so
you're just going to be putting it as
close to the lower lash line as possible
okay just like that just this is what
this came from I just scribble it on
might the palm of my hand so that it
gets all the excess off that I don't
need then you're gonna take a MAC
eyeshadow in sable it's just a really
pretty like dark brown kind of purply I
see it has but I don't know and you're
going to take I got this brush in
Nordstrom's having this anniversary sale
and I just got this brush for in a brush
kit it came in this kit in this thing
it's so cute
it was only fifty dollars and that
sounds like a lot but let me show you
all the brushes it came with and Mac
brushes are pretty expensive it came
with this powder brush and it's so cute
this is purple at the top see it came
with this it's more like a crease brush
is on my favorite crease brush but it's
crease for us it's yellow this this is
an eye shadow brush it's really big but
that's okay I guess if you just want to
pack it on and it's blue and then it
came with this crease brush and this is
a good crease crease brush I hate that
word
okay anyways you're going to take this
eyeliner brush and then just dip it in
here just tap it tap off any excess and
you're just gonna place it above the gel
liner so the gel liner was kind of like
a guide of where to place it I guess you
can say and you can smudge it a bit
because this is an eye shadow so that's
what I'm kind of trying to do don't
really be precise like I swear you can
put this in the dark if you want without
a mirror it's just really easy to put on
and then you're going to take your Mac
again this is an eye pencil and instead
of at the bottom
I feel like Aria has more like a a
lighter black it's not as harsh and I
feel like this is looks like black but
again it's not as harsh it's a nice
purple it's called purple - and you just
twist the top and that comes out then
we're just gonna put it lightly we're
not gonna put that much it's just and
then you're also going to take sorry I'm
going back a few steps you can take the
staple Mac I shot up again and then
you're gonna secure crease brush pass it
off and just like lightly just put a bit
on but more like on the outer crease
then you're going to take your Mac this
is such a pretty color for your
highlight it's vanilla
take your eyeshadow brush again put some
on and just pack it under your brow okay
so I actually forgot to do this step um
when I was doing when I said I have no
idea why because I guess I'm such an
idiot but you're gonna take mascara and
I'm actually using this Dior show iconic
I got as a gift I normally use
just like a lore'l or something but I
got a gift from nice decided hey why not
you know so it looks like this I really
like it it's that it doesn't voluma nice
as much as I want so if you have more of
like a balloon - mascara you should
probably use that one since arias
eyelashes are so thick and I'm just
gonna be so wiggle the line of it so now
you have the eyes and I guess you
already saw okay so for arias cheeks I
feel like she has more of a um not
really pink but more like a deeper a
deeper pinkish color if that makes sense
um this doesn't have a cap on it but
it's matte as you can probably guess
already it's really old I don't know if
they still have it
it's my mom's and it's probably at least
like a year old I don't even know um
it's the color prism you can't even
really see like the writing at all it's
completely destroyed but anyway it's a
pretty color and I'm going to use a
Sonia Kashuk brush a blush brush you can
get it at Target it just looks like this
I really like it so you're just going to
tap some on take up any excess smile
so you can't really see it that much but
you can still tell what this is just a
bit of a flush I really like that look
this is more like a I just went on a
walk like outside in the springtime type
of look and then for the lips Aria has a
like a berry like deeper color lip and
it's not really glossy but I feel for
this will clean everything is mostly met
I feel like you need to have a little
bit of a shimmer in it so I'm going to
be using Max dazzle the last date night
and it looks like this it's just a
really really pretty color
and there you have it I hope you enjoyed
this look and please watch one of my
videos that I'll be making and send me
