video and if you guys didn't know for
all my previous videos which have been a
long time ago because I haven't film in
so long I'm sorry about that and one
Spring Break right now but um so it all
in all my previous videos I've been
telling you guys leave me comments in my
tumblr you can just press like my little
ask button and then it can be able to
leave me a message and it could be an
office it could be public it doesn't
matter so I just asked you to ask me
questions and I will answer it in my
next ask Natalie video and now I am
doing my house cannot only video and I
have all my questions ring caramel on
top so that's why I'm going to be
looking over there but I'm just going to
scroll through and see which questions
to answer and I'll try to answer as many
as them as many of them as I can
and yeah so thank you for everyone who
actually asks me questions was if you
didn't in this video would not be
happening right now so just thank you
for that and I'm just going to get
started and start answering your my
first one was where did you get your
Easter dress from outfit of the day and
if you guys don't know I have an
Instagram and I also have a fashion
tumbler which is where you guys have to
know my questions on but I also have an
Instagram and I post every single outfit
of the day that I take pictures of in my
Instagram so it is at Natalie barboo and
I will leave that in the bottom bar
below but I got my Easter dress from
forever 21 and it will be in a home
coming up soon because I'm going to do a
spring break haul because I did some
shopping while I'm down here in Florida
a lot of the questions that were asked
this isn't a specific person but a lot
of questions that were asked for how do
I update my wardrobe and one way to
update your wardrobe I think is really
to get like accessories because
accessories are cheap exception if you
go to forever 21 and they kind of
completely redo your whole entire outfit
and if you circle your outfits on
accessories it kinda just revamps
everything that's one way to do it
another way to do it is galih to forever
21 H&amp;amp;M one of those cheap stores at
Target something like that goodwill
that's good we'll have some cute things
go there and just try to find some key
pieces that you don't really have and
that you
I want to add in to your wardrobe and
that's a really good way to start and
then you can kind of circle all of your
new fashion shop new shopping sprees
around those heat pieces so you kind of
want to start chief just because it's
kind of expensive if you want to throw
everything out and start from scratch
again that's kind of ridiculous but if
you have the money to spend for that
then go go ahead but I personally would
try to start really cheap like 13 1 hmm
good well those places and try kind of
getting some new things that you don't
have in your closet they're just because
of you again if you wonder like restart
your wardrobe you might want to go there
and set up like really expensive stores
so that's my little piece of advice for
that another question what is your life
like and you said schedule what I do in
my spare time so this is a fun question
um so normally during the school week I
go to school wake up go to school I come
home I procrastinate my homework until
the very last minute and I'm on my
computer all day that's my schedule is
idealistic awake like I've been really
boring and then during the weekends I
just like hanging out my friends again I
procrastinate and do my homework Sunday
night do all my projects the day before
they do don't really recommend it but
that's what I do and what I do on my
spare times pretty much does hang out
with my friends or making YouTube videos
and that's pretty much my life what are
your favorite shops my favorite stores
are probably Urban Outfitters is
definitely number one my real target
everyone hmm that's my phone I like
Aeropostale I like American Eagle I like
just like stores like that like typical
stores everyone else likes and I really
love going to boutiques I have in my
spring right called I'm gonna do I want
some shopping and a few boutiques around
here and I'm going to do I'm gonna show
you guys some of the things I got cuz mu
teks you find a lot of different things
and that's what I really like about that
lot of people are asking about my hair
I'm noticing so I will be doing a hair
video all about my hair soon and like
the products that I use and everything
because I literally just scrolled
through and I had five questions asking
me how I do my hair so I will do I'll do
a straightening video because a lot of
times I wanna show you my hair people
always ask me to do a video on how I
straighten my hair and like the things
that I use a night so I'll do a
straightening hair video and then I'll
do just like what I do every day to my
hair
and just answer questions about like my
haircut and how I style it and all of
that stuff so keep in mind that some
other questions I've been seeing is I'm
starting a fashion blog can you give me
an advice so my advice were if you start
a fashion blog let's just be consistent
I'm kind of bad with that look in the
beginning I was really consistent
actually beginning I wasn't insisted
that I was to consist in then I stopped
them at I am now beacon sustains my main
thing because whenever I noticed I am
consistent I get more followers and I
get a lot more like comments and inboxes
and messages so just be consistent and
kind of get your word and get your name
out there by trying to just um putting
it on random websites that had kind of
like profession blogs are on tumblr just
if you follow a bunch of people normally
they'll follow you back or I don't
really have a YouTube channel it's great
to put it on there I kind of like my
fashion blog I'm really got big um with
seventeen so obviously if you have a
major platform like that they could get
into maybe a local magazine or something
put your name out there if not I'm just
saying be consistent because the more
consistent you are the more followers
you will get so just be consistent in
the beginning it's gonna be really slow
you're not going to get that many but
once you start it you will start getting
more and make some people may actually
be like hey check this girl out she's
really good because they really like you
so just because it's saying kind of say
what you're wearing if you put the name
of the stores that really helps another
question was what my ethnicity is and I
have answered this question quite a few
times but still a lot of people are
wondering then I don't mind answering
this question um my mom is from Honduras
and my dad is from Romania a lot of
people all the time comment like oh my
gosh I'm done during too bla bla it's
like oh that's really cool but I'm also
not like all Honduran I think a lot of
people think I'm a hundred percent
Duren but no I have to say like half of
European because my dad's from Romania
and my mom is from Honduras and they
were born and raised there so it's not
like my grandparents or anything like
that it's like my parents were born and
raised there and they came to America
they were 18 when I questioned do I have
a boyfriend no I do not um do you do
your eyebrows yourself no I get them
waxed I keep up with them like when I do
get them waxed I pluck all the hair is
once they start growing in but sometimes
I just like stop doing it and they are
such when I said that I need to get them
waxed again but yeah I do get them done
I do not do them myself
how old are you I have 15 years old but
my birthday is in I think like five days
or something I six days it's April 16th
so I'm turning 16 on April 6 celebrity
crush oh this is fun um all in one
direction book series definitely The
Hunger Games right now I'm like obsessed
The Hunger you like Harry Potter oh my
gosh I'm gonna get shunned for this I
know it I've never seen any of the
movies or I read any of the books okay
don't call me you've never had a
childhood or whatever I know I really
wish I did watch Harry Potter but when I
was little I just never watch it I never
read the books and I feel like if I
start watching them now it's kind of
stupid because they're already done that
means like I don't know but no I have
not I do regret not seeing that but I
mean it is what it is favorite color my
favorite pop color we probably have to
be pink or blue or yellow I really like
those two colors when you first started
making YouTube videos or getting a lot
of views no I didn't I was not getting a
lot of views of some of you guys have
been there like my very first subscriber
my very first three um I did not get a
lot of views
I got a hundred subscribers I think a
month after I posted my first video
around a month after that my first are
my hundred views and as you get more
like it's not like if the first day you
only get three that means you're gonna
get three every single day like I do
have more subscribers you get more and
more each day that makes sense so like
yeah first I might have gone three but
the next day I may have got intent
you know what I'm saying so I did get
one worse it picked up but it wasn't
like I started and damn I was YouTube
famous or something like I'm still not
but I mean I am so happy with my
subscribers I have a think over 4000
already like that's crazy to me so just
thank you guys so much for if you are
subscribed to me and if you're not you
should said I wonder what concert I'm
going to see one direction first things
first I'm totally jealous of you I have
seen one direction live before with
their big time right joy but I
definitely have I really wanted to get
tickets to their summer tour in America
but it was sold out of course I am going
in box seats but of course like I'd
rather have floor seats but I'm still
going so I'm so happy but yeah I kind of
gets me mad okay this is gonna be a
little 30-second ran kind of gets me mad
how they're sold out now because it's
like all of the little kids and people
who just found out about them are making
them be sold out and I'm like seriously
like I've known about them for like a
year already and now they're all sold
out so I'm kind of mad but I mean that's
okay um but what's right in concert I
find that there's some retort because if
you're ready to see one direction was
going to be in the summer I suggest
probably just like shorts and denim
shorts and maybe like a crop top I love
that for the summer but also depends if
you're going to an indoor arena like an
indoor stadium arena thing if not then
you might want to wear like shorts and
maybe a cute vest with some like cowboy
booties under Isaac that's so cute but
obviously kind of related back to your
own personal style and just kind of have
fun it just yeah I couldn't go with my
feels great with your only personal
style and stuff but I really like denim
shorts for a summer concert so that's
like a definite like you should probably
wait denim shorts how tall are you
I am only 5 3 I am very short I wish I
was taller but yeah I'm only 5 3 what
grade am I in I am a sophomore in high
school for those of you who don't live
in the United States a sophomore in high
school is a 10th grader so grade 10 what
type of phone do I have my phone is
right here I have a iPhone
have you tried any of the high low
dresses I have not been I'm even dying
it
I'm one so bad my mom just got wound and
said that she didn't like it and it was
a bit too small on her so I'm gonna try
it on to see if it fits me crossing my
fingers I'd guys it's so cute but no I
have not purchased one yet but I really
really want to one of the questions is
do you think I talk too much
um probably yeah I think I talk too much
in Kansai the situation about I mean
that was her intuition one of the
questions was are / were you a dancer um
no I've never danced and I'm not a
dancer asking me about my previous
seventeen feature thing where did I get
the navy blue or nothing nothing look
where did I get my black dress and that
is it was in like the top right corner
that's where it was
so the top right corner had like a bunch
of patterns on it I bought that dress at
free people and it was on sale so they
probably don't have it anymore of
psychotic in November when I went to New
York for Thanksgiving and the rest of
the questions that I've been receiving
we're all on how did I become like make
it and that Disney and how did I get
seventeen to notice we have a video
talking all about that so I will post
link it in the bottom bar below if you
want to see it because I'm not
explaining everything I explained in
another video but yeah and you guys are
asking me all those questions for the
accident ask Natalie Bing and I will
probably be having another one if you
guys want to let me know if you guys
want me to have another one because I
didn't they're really fun answering all
these questions and again we can do
personal fashion any type of question
that you want yeah so thank you guys all
for asking me questions and I really
hope that you guys want another video

in mind I rule I'm so sorry I haven't
