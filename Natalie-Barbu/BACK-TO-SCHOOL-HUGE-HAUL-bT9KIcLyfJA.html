filming a haul for you guys this is a
back to school haul and my back to
school videos are still going on they
might end a little soon but i still have
this all for you guys and I'm really
excited to show you guys there are a few
outfits that are totally not school
appropriate unless you are in college
like myself so that is why these are
back to school for me if you guys are
new to my channel then please subscribe
well but if you guys would subscribe I
post videos every Tuesday and Friday so
make sure you hit that button down there
you can also make sure to thumbs this
video up that helps people find my
channel and find my video so that helps
but I'm but without further ado I'm just
gonna get started in the city before we
start this video please comment down
below when your school starts and where
you live like I just kind of want to
know in geographical terms like what
schools start later what school start
earlier my school already started it
started I think like the 17th or
something like that but College normally
starts a little bit earlier than most
schools I think most school start around
like the 20s or something but yeah ok
now I'm actually gonna get certain
rigorous product that i'm showing is
from hinckley perfect and it comes in
this really cute hot pink box like this
is what it came in the mail super Q and
I feel you can give this as a gift to
someone and before I start to dislike
unboxing or not unboxing but this video
I just wanna let you guys know that
Pinkley perfect did sponsor this video
so thank you guys so much for partnering
with me and for working with me on this
video I think all of their clothes are
super cute so you guys should definitely
check them out I will have all the links
down below and I will also have all the
links to everything else that I bought
like three people Windsor thrift day old
thrifting can't really have a link to
that first thing that I got is a pencil
pouch so that's perfect for back to
school this is what the pencil pouch
looks like and it says my beach towel is
cuter than yours I think that's so so
cute in my pencil case baroque so this
thing is like no longer on it so I'm
definitely gonna be using this and the
whole purpose of Hinkley perfect is that
they want to capture summer all year
round basically so all of their clothes
are kind of summer themed and they just
have the essence of summer in it so that
is why i love it because if you guys
don't know if you guys have been
watching my channel through like the
winter months and also the summer months
so for our last like a year or so maybe
like half a year six months you guys
know that I absolutely hate the cold and
like summer is my season that is just
the best time I'm always happy it's just
great all my friends know it like
everyone just knows that summer is the
best time of the year for me especially
like I just hate cold weather if it is
below like 75 degrees it's cold I'm one
of those people and originally from
Florida so like anything that is below
75 is like oh maybe I need a jacket so I
am obsessed with the fact that they
capture summer all year long I think
that is so cute because obviously when
it's freezing cold outside the only
thing I'm thinking of is summer the next
thing that I got are some leggings
because you guys know that leggings are
essential to college hello if you guys
are going to be spending any time in the
library then you need leggings so these
are just plain black leggings but the
material is actually really soft and
stretchy and it has their little logo on
it which i think is really cute so it's
still like even though they're black
leggings but still has a little what is
this called sea horse yes still a little
sea horse on it and the next thing that
they got is also perfect for school
because it is a sweatshirt and it says
is it summer yet so I feel like this is
what everyone needs coming back from
summer because everyone's just counting
down the days until summer is back I
love it this is a little bit oversized
which I like and it's gray and super
soft so really really soft you guys it's
like that nice material on the inside
it's like a fuzzy little blanket you
know you know I wish you guys can like
touch it through the screen that would
be cool come on it's 2016 and we don't
have things where you can like go inside
the camera in touch actually that would
be kind of creepy also yeah I take the
back I don't want that to happen so like
I said that I will have all the links
down below they come in super cute pink
boxes they have a cute clothes captures
the essence of summer all year long and
they are very inexpensive you guys so
people come the links you guys will see
that they are not expensive so make sure
to check them out thank you so much too
pink like perfect for sponsoring this
video all them on their Instagram they
have a blog they have Instagram they
have twitter all of that good steps this
is like a lot of people's Instagram
theme so if anyone wants to take a
picture of this sort i'm sure you guys
is Windsor you guys know I'm obsessed
with Windsor I absolutely love them i
think that they have the cutest clothes
so i got a few things on there and i'm
also addicted to online shopping so like
please help me guys the first thing that
i got i am actually going to be wearing
in LA so I don't want to try it on for
you guys because I'm gonna be wearing it
and if you guys want to see it on Oh me
on instagram i'm doing a shameless plug
in right here so make sure to follow me
because i'm about to leave to the
airport to go to LA to visit steph and
i'm so so excited it's a top it's a crop
top and it has like crochet detailing on
the middle and on the sides and I was
scared that was gonna have a nip slip
but I actually tried it on and it's
placed perfectly so you won't have a nip
slip guys in the back is just like an
open back kind of so it just tries at
the top or buttons at the top and then
ties at the bottom and it's really cute
and then this is what is so cute about
it that it comes in a set so these are
the shorts that it comes with so I'm
obsessed with like two pieces the ones
that match so yeah I'm really excited to
wear this thing that I got I will also
be wearing in LA and taking photos in so
obviously again not gonna try it on for
you guys yet follow me to see it um but
it is this silk dress I don't know about
you guys but I have been wanting one of
these silk slip dresses for so long mine
is super wrinkly so don't worry i will
be steaming it before i tried on but i
am obsessed with this color it is so
freaking cute look at this color it's
like a purple pink silk cute little slip
i love it and then the back is open like
that it has like a bunch of ties and
it's open x1 is your thing that I got is
this tight skirt and i will tell you
guys why I got this so it is just this
plane like teal colored tight stir that
type of like strength material and even
though it's called asymmetrical skirt
very like body-hugging which is exactly
why I got it because when you go out I
feel like I like wearing tight things
rather than lose things at night when I
go out so I'm trying to get more of
those so that is why I got that next
thing that I got is a jacket so this one
is perfect for back to school so this is
a bomber jacket it's green and has
stripes down the side
the arms and then have this like at the
collar which I really like so yeah I
thought this was super cute and I'm also
wearing this in LA basically everything
new that I got I will be wearing in LA
not even sorry about it so shocker will
also be wearing this in LA but ok so i
am wearing this where i got this like
blue chiffon I think that's the material
top and it has this like crisscross and
its opening in the front and then it has
this like the shoulders are cut I forgot
what that's called and then it has bell
sleeves so it has a ton going on it has
so many trends as cutouts it has the two
like crisscross things it's a flowy
shirt and bell sleeves and you would
think it's too much but it's actually
not and it's really cute and it fits
perfectly like it just kind of like
flows on you like it just sits on you
and just it's just really nice next
thing I got from Windsor is this chop
and it is this navy blue I don't know if
Navy actually it's like a grey blue
color and has these those like
crisscross like things on the front I
never know what those are called but
yeah I really like it and it's also a
crop top and the sleeves have like
cuffed sleeves the next thing I that I
got is also perfect for back to school
because it is a dress so if you want to
go out but it's not necessarily tight so
if you don't really like tight dresses
this one is totally for you guys so it
is a high neck and it's olive green so
it's a high neck and it's just a plain
loose dress so it's tight at the top and
loose at the bottom but then the back of
it is has that crisscross thing I need
to know the name if I'm going to be
making a video by showing you guys like
what are they called please tell me in
the comments below what they are called
they are not called crisscross things so
like let me know in comments below what
they're called please the first thing i
got is one of my favorites it's actually
like so so cute so it is this hot pink
rum / most of you guys know that i do
not wear colors a lot but i could not
turn this down it's seriously so cute i
feel like it just fits so perfectly so
it's like tight at the very top of it
and then it's like loosens up but it's
still like really cute and short and i
love short rompers and i feel like this
one i would just stand out so much it's
like such a hot pink look at it compared
to me
right now what yeah it's such a hopping
and yes another thing with those
crisscross things um it's another shirt
so it is this tunic I think it's this
unit because its pretty long it's this
like burnt orange color and has those
things in the front and it's actually
pretty long it's not a dress but it's
also not just like a shirt that's why I
think it's a tunic like maybe you could
wear it as a dress put it might be super
super short and like you might want to
wear some shorts under but this is like
such a first day of school outfit I
would have worn this in high school to
the first day of school the next ones
are thing that I got is this denim
jacket it's my favorite thing that I got
I actually posted a picture in it so
make sure that you guys go check it out
but it is this denim hot jacking it like
seriously was over again cute yeah I'm
obsessed with this denim jacket it's a
little bit oversized and has rips all
over it and it's just like I feel like
such a cool kid wearing this so I'm
really excited that i bought this that
was april my winter things and now we
are going to move on to free people
which is another one of my favorite
stores if not my favorites or ever so
the first thing that I got is this
jacket like plain i guess like beige
color army jacket like thing but it also
has those strings in the pro runt but
this one's a lot looser it's super
oversized which i really like because
when it starts getting colder which i'm
not happy about but when it does start
gettin colder i will be needing to wear
jackets to class not quite yet because
it's still about like 95 degrees outside
which even if I'm like sweating the
second i get outside i would much rather
that then feel like knives are piercing
through my body when I walk out and it's
for a reason cold not wait to wear this
plague to like a pumpkin patch or like a
corn maze or something like that I am
really excited for fall but I just I
just can't let go of summer the tunics
free people thinks that I got our
dresses the next one is this tight
bodycon dress so it's purple and has
like a tribal print to it I don't know
if this was tribal actually it's
probably not but some print to it and
then it's actually open in the front so
if you do have cleavage I guess it would
show but for me it doesn't really show
that
and then you tie it so you can tie it as
tight or loose as you want which is what
I like because I don't really like
having my boobs hang out like I don't
know it's just like not me so yeah it's
another tight dress so it's good for
going out so that I got i also posted a
picture on Instagram in it and it is so
freaking cute oh my gosh it's like one
of my favorite dresses that I own so I
had got this dress it has I don't know
if you're looking at is like paint on it
i don't know it looks like paint to me
like water colored paint but it's just a
low v-neck and then had the sleeves have
these like to stretch straps on each one
and it also has a cutout so you guys
cannot see the cut out but it is it
right there like at the waist and you'll
see it in the picture and it's just
flowy and soft and cute and I love it
this is good for going out to dinners or
something like that maybe not to class
it might be a little too fancy thing I
got is from brandy Melville and I did
not get that much but i got this when I
was in New York and it is just a typical
I Love New York t-shirt please don't ask
me why i got it at brandy melville and
why didn't get it on the side of the
street but it is because ok I'm like
don't ask me but this is why all right
so this is why it's because this one is
like slouchy and looks worn and has a
little rip on i'm pretty sure somewhere
maybe I know the heart is like faded red
I just thought it was so much cuter than
one of those like t-shirt material ones
and when I wore it this one guy he was
like oh like that actually looks like
like you actually don't look like a
tourist wearing that so I was like you
know thank you take that as a compliment
and the next thing that I got is these
socks and I'm just like obsessed with
these socks next thing that I got is
stuff from the thrift store so the first
thing is the short time actually wearing
and it's like a huge Miami Dolphins
t-shirt you guys are probably thinking
why do I want to see that I don't know I
like it so maybe you guys wanted to see
it and then the next thing that I got I
was so excited to see this out of her
store it is this plain black calvin
klein jeans shirt these are such a thing
right now and urban outfitters probably
sells these for like 45 dollars so I'm
really excited that I found this for
like two dollars at their store that was
it for this hall thank you again for a
