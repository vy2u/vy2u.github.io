filming a back-to-school lookbook today
I actually filmed this a really long
time ago but I never got around to
editing it just because of moving in and
school and everything like that but I'm
actually really proud of how it turned
out so please let me know if you like
the editing in it I really like this
sort of editing it kind of reminds me of
not really a music video but I like how
I don't have a voiceover in it I mean
you guys don't need me talking to
explain to you what you're seeing all
the items will also be like down below
that yeah make sure that your guys you
guys are following me on instagram
because that is where i post a lot of
updates in my life and instagram is
definitely my most used social network
but yeah make sure you follow me on that
and tell me if you guys have started
school already
most people have started school I will
be very surprised if you have not
started school yet but if you have or if
you have not tell me when you start and
this does not need to be for the first
day of class that's why I'm still
posting it because it is basically just
a back to school transitioning into fall
most of these things are dress code
appropriate especially I mean if you're
at college
everything is but I think most of our
dress code appropriate and that's why I
have like sweaters and jeans and stuff
like that and it is freezing in school
buildings so I mean you guys I mean it
should be good we don't need to be
wearing booty shorts anymore because it
is cold in school like I am always
freezing in school I'm gonna do a Q&amp;amp;A
soon so please follow me on Instagram to
make sure that you're keeping up with
that that's on its shell problems like
please follow me on Instagram know
follow me if you want but I'm gonna be
doing a Q&amp;amp;A on there and I think that's
all I have to say and if you can't out I
have a new background and I added this
little dreamcatcher and I have a
tapestry which you probably can't see
because my doors open yeah I just have a
lot more decorations I'm going to be
doing an apartment tour soon so thumbs
this video up if you guys while I full
auto partners or not just report
apartment door that's crazy that I live
in

what other videos you guys want to do
because I'm going to be going so much
more um like I'm gonna try like having
an actual schedule so please please
please let me know any video requests
that you guys have and yeah just let me
know what you think on this video so I
can have some great feedback from you
guys because you guys are obviously the
people that are giving me feedback cuz
I'm not gonna obviously I do these
videos to make like entertain you guys
and also I love making videos but you
know what I'm saying so yeah make sure
you to give this video a big thumbs up
