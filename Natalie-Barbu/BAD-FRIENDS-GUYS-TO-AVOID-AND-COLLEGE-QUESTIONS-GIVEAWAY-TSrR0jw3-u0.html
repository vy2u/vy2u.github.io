Katie and we are here doing a life in
Mike's video so i recently did a kind of
advice video about cheetah in the pat
like last week and you guys really liked
it so now I brought katie here because
we both have becoming routed the website
it's a ministry for young girls to come
and we kind of when you blog post and
where we gotta just want to be like an
older sister figure 2 girls so you
better to do life advice am i right yeah
we are doing 30 topics st. friendship
 boys and then career general like
live stage advice and if you guys stay
tuned till the end we have a really
exciting announcement about a giveaway
that we were doing it it's a pretty big
giveaway so stay and watch this whole
video to find out the rules it's really
good it's like it you'll really miss
today yeah we want this stuff we bought
it we like yeah so first topic is
friendship so we just want to talk about
something like things that we've learned
that how long have we been friends
gaining literally over a decade like 10
years we've been friends this granny
diplomat we met in fifth grade we met
her birthday party in fifth grade yeah
and we stayed in touch through facebook
Messenger that was the issue bonded over
Twilight movie Twilight now we were like
oh my god you soon Jacob take your shirt
off all the key oh my gosh Team Jacob
forever yeah you have our messages it's
a joke it but it varies like and we
definitely have had ups and downs in our
friendship which I think it's honestly a
good thing you don't want a friendship
that's kind of shallow and you only have
ups and you never talk about anything
real so yeah we gently on her ups and
downs and the number one thing for us is
that we are very honest with each other
both of us are very blunt but to the
point almost too blunt yeah is there
such thing as too much yeah totally
we're to the point we were pretty blunt
and we will tell each other exactly how
it is so in the past if Katie maybe was
doing something that I was like I was
doing something where she was playing no
no no we've told each other like what
are you doing and I think that's healthy
so I could buy healthy partnership
telling each other obviously be nice or
about it like don't just be like you're
an idiot and what are you doing yeah you
have to show from a place of love and a
place of actually caring for them not
just like you're so stupid that's not
gonna get anywhere and get you anywhere
that's just gonna make a person hate you
but it's showing love to be there for
your friends in a way that's honest like
if you really know that they're doing
something that's destructive tell them
tell them tell them yeah please don't
keep a secret because if you see them
and you know that there yeah like you
said doing something destructive and
you're just sitting there watching them
you're almost just as bad as not telling
them like the best the worst I can
happen is that they get mad at you but
at least you knew that you were doing
the right thing so I captain Rugrats
you've got out of each other and we
haven't talked to each other for a while
because we were both like you told me
something I they want to hear even
though I needed to hear it and then six
months later a year later we were like
sorry thank you so much why didn't I let
you keep it boy yeah it's always it's
always this way yeah and also if you
went bad friends we both have
experienced bad people in our lines and
cut them out you don't need them you
really don't need that right to short
for negativity yeah if you friends are
negative and constantly bringing you
down and just not uplifting like they
should be then you don't need them in
your life you don't need to have a huge
Cooper friend better to just have to
really create friends but a huge group
of breath there's nothing wrong with
choosing yourself and choosing this
and only maintaining like positive
friendships because life's too short to
have somebody that really isn't there
for you and then also nobody wants a yes
man you don't want someone to say
everything to do is create oh my gosh
you amazing because that's no genuine an
estimate on us because we all criticize
each other and it's part of loving each
other well is to come out each other
from that place of saying you know you
does something wrong or you've offended
me it's okay to be offended with each
other it's okay to say that you're mad
at each other that's not going to break
your friendship if it's the right type
of friendship so next topic now we are
going to talk about boys so boys are a
huge form of lives as a man being 13 2
by the time you get married like
everyone goes to a point where they have
like the wrong guy or many wrong guys or
a pattern of wrong guys and that's okay
as long as you learn from it all right
we are here to tell you that hopefully
our mistakes can help you learn yeah
don't have to go through all of the
wrong guys type of a cushion avoid um
you should avoid the liar the one that
you know Liza line is always lying to
you about little things like he's lying
to you about little things he's lying to
you about big things to know guys that
are addicts don't go back you don't need
that type of drama any type of addiction
whether it's drugs alcohol or even just
like a physical addiction any type of
addiction that's just not healthy if
they're dependent on something else
other than you know God or their own
like happiness like they're using
something else from fill that void they
are going to drag you down and I'm
saying that from personal experience it
doesn't get better without help like you
are not a counselor and you're not there
god they're not you're not you're save
been so yeah don't think they can well
the third type of guy that you should
avoid I think is the guy that is just
always like I wanted to the frat guy I
don't looks like frat guy cuz I like the
the guy in college that is literally
just at a party and he has a bunch of
girls and like he has a number he like
keeps count of the girls he's hooked up
with these people that have died
exist we've seen them like avoid them
they're just if you don't want to be
another girl on their list because guys
I have seen guys pull out their phones
and on their notes they just scroll and
scroll scroll and there's just a bunch
of girl names on there that they've
hooked up with that's literally
disgusting it's disgusting and do you
want to be a girl that list don't want
someone who we use you as an object
views you as a girl on the list you want
someone who if they have had that type
of past where they have hooked up with a
lot of people but they realized that
like that like they don't want to be the
guy that has a list on his phone anymore
then that's fine people do change but
like with me you don't want to be with
someone who views you is just a girl on
the list like that you're worth more
than that so I'm the biggest one not in
fact about last week the cheater yeah
cheaters once a cheater always a cheater
that's my phrase and then it's blunt but
you can avoid so much heartache and pain
by just avoiding those types of guys or
running away the first sign of trouble
and one second or third time it's a hey
it's never too late like you've never
sleep to get out of that type of
relationship yeah and if you know some
of its in that type of relationship they
love enough to tell them that that's not
God's best for them and that's not what
they deserve because it's not nobody who
serves that everyone can change but get
the kind of team yeah I have like a
whole video on that so I don't get like
too much into it but check it out I'm
very passionate about the subject it's a
good video also for boys you do not need
a boy like I don't I think that we're in
a generation where everyone is like oh
couple girl goals relationship goals
like I need that to a boyfriend look at
them they're so cute look at all their
Instagram pictures instakill yeah
someone sometimes even have like a
hashtag with their like ships p they're
shipping people it's like really weird
so you don't need a boy even in this
generation and social media and
everything like that kind of presses it
on you and like every TV show that you
watch and everything you really don't
need one though like it is perfectly
fine to be by yourself it's really
freeing to be by yourself and to learn
that lesson like as early as possible
because it's even more
the order and I have to talk about that
in my blog link in bio there we go ah
but I'm a neck serial dater and I'm
proud of it because it taught me what
about my life but I'm no longer living
as a serial dater because I found that
there's true freedom comes from being
true to yourself and pursuing your own
dreams or your own passions and not
losing yourself in another person preach
thank God and the next topic is going to
be about life and just like what would
to do with your life I think that's such
a big thing like especially around
college senior year of high school age
like everyone its kind of asking you if
you're a senior in high school I think
you've gotten a question look so where
are you going to college like what's
your major look what do you want to do
and you're you probably don't be like
stop like I don't know I don't know like
I don't know what I want to do i don't
know if i want to go to call it i don't
know you know and that's okay that's a
totally okay you're what 17 18 19 years
old you don't need to know what you want
to do when you're 30 that's like absurd
to be asking that I feel like you don't
ask a nine-year-old to know what they're
gonna do with their 20 because if you
don't you don't know like things change
times change I mean so many things who
would've thought that when we were being
born like or well we're like five years
old that there would be a job is like a
social media coordinator that word would
have been like what is a media yeah so I
mean things aren't gonna you might
realize look later on in life that you
want to do something else than what
you're trying to do or new jobs might
emerge like you don't even know what you
want to do right now and that's like
totally okay and it's okay change your
mind to yeah it's totally a way to
change your mind you go four years in
college is one major and then all of a
sudden realized you hate it and you
don't want to do it anymore that does
suck and it is a pain but it's worth not
being happy to learn your life and you
might get your dream job and you might
find out that smell as one and that's
okay I mean we ought to go through those
stepping stones to get to our next you
know our next place and you're not stuck
somewhere just because you feel like
you're supposed to be there that's
it's not God's best for you embrace some
journey like it
to be fun you're not supposed to know at
this age like what you're going to end
up like at 40 and who knows how your
path is going to be shaped by what
you're going through now and so it's
something that is really hard is to
trust the process but it's worth it
because you find out that something you
might stumble upon that you never think
is a career or you know everything's
going to work it actually ends up being
your own life and that's really cool
that is just something that I feel like
we need to chat college students and
high schoolers because there's so much
pressure from adults like what do you
want to do with your life like or like
when you tell them your major and
they're like oh you know and it's just
like good for you yeah like that's going
to be interesting like no it's so for
