hear me I am filming with a new lens if
you guys can't tell and I am super up
close to the camera because it is a zoom
lens and might be able to hear it the
focusing sound in the back so this is
basically a test video to see if I can
film with this lens or if this lens is
best for pictures or what but tonight I
am coming my Q&amp;amp;A video that I had posted
on Instagram and I told you two guys to
leave me questions on the comments or
Twitter or snapchat so I'm just going to
answer those questions some of them and
thank you for everyone who asks me
questions if you guys didn't and you
want to for next QA I'm planning on
doing one maybe like once a month or
something like that if you guys want to
do that then make sure to follow me on
all my social networks I'm definitely
gonna be doing instagram but a snapchat
QA might be coming up so yeah those are
all the announcements I have but if you
are a new subscriber and you are just
interested in a Q&amp;amp;A video make sure to
subscribe to me if you want but I always
feel awkward like I don't have force you
guys to subscribe like if you want
that's totally cool too so the first
question is my favorite song and at the
moment actually I've been listening to
Spotify Xindi pop playlist if you guys
don't know what that is I love it look
down below it's like the best playlist
that Spotify has ever created I don't
like making my own playlists I just
listen to other peoples and this one is
so good so basically every song off of
that is my favorite so I've been really
loving monster leave me home by Sarah
Hartman surprised yourself by Jack
Garrett and then unsteady Jace Justin
Caruso remix by the X ambassadors those
3 i've been listening to like all the
time and smaller by erik hassle so those
I don't have a public Spotify playlist
they're just like in my saved songs but
yeah indie pop playlist on Spotify has
in my favor
Juarez suck dot 13 asked what would be
your dream place to live in so my dream
place to live would probably be
somewhere warm but not too warm I really
love living in North Carolina i am home
right now ft you guys can tell and i
absolutely love North Carolina it does
get a little cold to my liking which is
surprising because North Carolina does
not get like that cold but I really
think living on the west coast would be
super cool not LA but Santa Barbara I
think is really nice or I don't know if
I would live in Florida again I used to
live in Fort Lauderdale and I don't
think I would move down there again but
maybe like somewhere a little more north
of Fort Lauderdale but like south of
jacksonville my best friend here on
YouTube asked how much do you love me
and I would say like maybe like a two on
a scale of one to ten just kidding
Brenda Lovera asked who would you marry
kids cuddle with out of these
celebrities back efron Justin Bieber
Dylan O'Brien so this was actually
pretty easy because it normally it's
like Mary kiss kill and then instead of
kill you said cuddle so like they're all
win-win situation so I think I would
marry Dylan O'Brien because he just like
seems nice um I would kiss justin bieber
and i would cuddle with zach
that's what sites / store is your
favorite online shopping store I don't
do that much online shopping but
probably Windsor is my favorite I've
done a lot of halls with them so yeah
they're my favorite check them out baby
girl Gen X asked me where do you see
yourself in 10 years and I see myself
with a job I still want to be doing
YouTube videos as long as I possibly can
which means as long as you guys want me
to do YouTube videos and as long as
YouTube is still a thing I hope that
YouTube is always a thing I hope it's
not something like MySpace or Facebook
we're kind of like phased out over the
years so I am hoping it's always the
thing but yeah I want to be doing
YouTube videos and if I'm stick stuck
sticking with it for 10 years like I
should have grown a lot I don't know if
I want to make solely YouTube my main
career though like a lot of people are
full-time youtubers that sounds really
cool and stuff but I honestly think I
want to also do other things I'm getting
a degree in engineering right now so
obviously my first job is probably going
to be something at engineering but yet
so to answer that I honestly have no
idea hopefully i'm still doing youtube
if you guys want me to be like i would
absolutely love that and I would want
YouTube to be like my main thing but not
my only thing so I wouldn't want to be a
full-time youtuber babygirl Gen X also
asked what my favorite social media app
was and hands down Instagram but I'm
totally getting into like snapchat and
Twitter so if you
call me on that by grace lee asked when
are you going to seek race again and
probably really soon because we always
seem to see each other a lot Madison
Johnson 17 asked what are the three
goals that you want to accomplish in
life I love your videos thank you so
much Madison and my three goals that I
want to accomplish I don't really have
three goals I in top my head but one I
want to just be a overall good person I
know that sounds like kind of cliche but
I really do I just want to be nice to
people would be a good person and just
share God's love with everyone I think
that's definitely top goal of mine as
long as I do that then I think I'm doing
something right number two would be to
graduate college with my industrial
engineering degree which I am heading on
that track so that should be filled in
two years and then number three is
eventually i do want to start my own
business be some sort of entrepreneur
assessing along those lines I think that
would be students Lily Bentley asked
where do you want to travel around and I
would say that I want to travel I have
been to a couple countries i have been
to most like a lot I've been to UM
England's I have been to France I've
been to Canada when I was like super
little so I don't even count that I've
been to Mexico Honduras um my actually
top choice right now is to go to Romania
because that is where my dad is from and
I've never been and I really want to go
kind of just see like where he grew up
like because he moved here when he was
18 so cute
up there so I would love to see like all
that stuff and like better my Romanian
your books about fish diminish I can't
even talk what server bez Clement Roman
ish diminish their big new mom nuisance
sanborn okay disclaimer guys I'm pretty
sure that was half spanish half Romanian
please don't kill me if any of you guys
speak Romanian that was totally
butchered but i do like understand
romanian i didn't even read this
question Paula GM GM said family story
would you like to live in Romania
instead I do not want to live in Romania
I'm very happy living in the United
States but I like i said i want to visit
and my family's story I don't know I'm
so bad with this I'm going to think of
some story time to tell you guys not on
a QA because I see it's like some people
have like a million story times on their
channel and I just can't help but think
that they're not real like you can't
have that many things happen to you and
my only one that thinks that that like
half the story times are it's like one
little thing that happens and then it's
like exaggerated to a whole big story
time to make it a story time video I
don't know so that's why would I do a
story time video for you guys I want it
to be actually real and like yes some
things might be a little more like my
emotions might be exaggerated but I want
it to be a real short time and I feel
like half of them aren't real I could be
totally wrong but like I feel like some
people that have 20 million story times
on their channel like that stuff can not
have
maybe I'm just cynical but that's what I
think last question I'm going to answer
is a snapchat question and it is when
are you even staff getting together
again and by the way that picture is so
cute you are look so pretty but me and
steph are planning on getting together
in California it's my turn to visit her
I'm trying to visit her this summer I do
have an internship though so i can't
really visit her like in the middle of
the summer but hopefully if the end of
the summer before i start classes again
i will be making a visit to la if any of
you guys are from there let me know and
then if not i'm pretty sure we're
planning on going to New York again in
October I don't know if we'll actually
be going to beautycon but we want to be
there around the same times beautycon or
sometime in October so yeah if that
answers your question we should totally
do a meetup that would be like the
funnest thing even if no one shows up
like we would still be together so we
could still be so fun but yeah that was
all the questions I'm going to answer
today so I hope you guys like this video
again this is testing out this lens so
yeah it's like really good quality at
least from the viewfinder so I hope it
turns out good when I well when I upload
it but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
video you want to participate in the
next one and definitely follow me on my
social medias and I am filming another
video like tomorrow or something so make
sure that you are subscribed love you
guys so much bye guys
