underwear smashing for $25 not where
it's been yeah
so we're and they match how cute I love
I've said this before I've worked with
them as a bunch of other videos and like
I always say I love with my stuff
matches and they don't only have bras
and underwear I only got one broad I got
all bathing suits and Katy didn't even
get a bra no I got like bathing suits
and activewear and loungewear
check it out down below but yes I do
here please subscribe tell me what your
favorite item was either mine yeah and
let's just confirm with the video so the
first man suit that I got is this really
cute purple triangle kind of top bathing
suit
so it's purple and green and has what
kind of like those leaves that are
really popular the palm leaves on them I
thought this is such a cute bikini and
then in the back its crisscross and
adjustable and the bottoms are just
matching bikini bottoms I am obsessed
with like green nature looking and
bottom so I love these have leaves on
them and I really like the purple the
first thing I got was this like indigo
bikini top and I really liked the fact
that adore me like really accommodates
like support and their bikinis like it's
not cheap material it's very tight on
the bottom which just adds a level of
support so that's just awesome and have
a little crisscross on the back at the
bottom there just a really cute little
bottom with like these little like knots
on the side yeah are they not oh they're
here what they not from outside
the funky name so they're just really
cute and I love how they add a little
detail to their product it's so feminine
and it's wonderful and the next thing
that I got is another mating suit so
this one is actually looks almost just
like the other one I shot but it's a
one-piece I have been really into one
pieces lately so I got this purple
outline with again like the palm leaves
on them that this one is more purple
than green bro and it took a triangle
top and it has padding on the inside and
then you can remove the padding because
I know some people don't like padding
and then it's kind of like crisscross at
the bottom or in the middle I don't know
if you guys can see that and then it
also had a criss cross back so I just
really like the one pieces because I
feel like they're kind of more like
feminine and girly and they're just
different than to keep normal bikinis I
really enjoyed wearing them except kind
of hard to Tanana we were talking about
it earlier
what's under cute rugged beach day but
like it's just hard to tannin them so
for the pic yes honestly for the picture
is really modest tricky so they are like
some with your family and yeah if you're
on a family beach trip you don't really
want to have a skimpy bikini on like a
tiki bottoms you know No yeah I actually
got the same bathing suit but in black
which I love black one pieces I'm really
really into this year I'm just because
you can pair I look like a little Jean
short and not feel like you're naked
going into a restaurant you know they
have like a little crisscross classic
not was saying and I'm so excited about
this it's probably my go-to one pieces
here yep and last makes you look
skinnier that so it's like and it's good
for your man and accuracy look tan black
is kind of weird over line and we're not
European yeah I agree I think that black
does more than white I don't really make
single second white male might look more
pale yeah not really chart unless you're
really dark but if you're just willing
average like us then black is better
since I'm wearing black renounce a
literally makes me look damn that no it
sounds like look at that one should give
up and then the next day thanks to that
I got is a black one as well I'm trying
to find the trough to it it's on the
floor it doesn't actually I think my
favorite one because of how simple it is
so I'm I love this so it's a few a
normal
I will kind of bikini but it has just
cute little details on it really like
the back how it has those like two lines
on it yeah it's just look different than
a normal Mickey me and it's super super
simple and then the bottoms are plain
black and again they're uniformed on the
sides so they have the two like strings
on the bottom so yeah it's just really
cute and I don't have a black bikini can
you believe that
wait really yeah I know I only have like
colorful bikinis I have black bottoms
but I don't have like a lot of shopping
to me so I really like loungewear like I
loved hanging out things are soft and
really really picky about fabric so I
bought this little set from Azure me
it's like this pink top here that's
extremely soft as a baby blue collar
like kind of like charcoal blue and
these cute little PJ bottoms that come
with it I love sets of PJ's because they
match and they're just adorable
I think you'll really upset the things
that yeah so it's not so cute I know and
these are really really lightweight but
perfect for summer with their summer
weight pants which I really needed and
I'm so excited about those there's no
sauce yeah does it really think about I
was like you definitely candies like
they're amazing and then the next
bathing suit that I got is this high
neckline so I love high neck bikinis I
think I have like four of them um this
one is blue and it has kind of like an
opening right down the middle which i
think is so cute and connect and then
it's kind of like a blue purple tie dye
color and then the back is an open back
which i think is just like adorable and
this is again another one that's kind of
hard to tan in one site and in a
high-neck one and it like make me look
like I was wearing top on so I don't
recommend it for tanning like this is
more if you're just kind of like hanging
out with a pool and you're like keep
applying sunscreen on or something like
that and then the bottoms are the same
color and design but whatever was in the
middle of the top it's like on the sides
now so I love how they match and they
coordinate I really really excited about
this large piece too is because it has
such a cute back what is that guy's but
that detail is so cute and flirty I love
it
you can wear that even like it's an
awesome
literally career is like a day with
leggings if you do ano and then the
legging that come with it are so soft
they're so so like that t-shirt and your
journey materials their leggings but at
the bottom my favorite part is that SS
very bottom and then they have a little
lace detail T so they match perfectly
and then the last bathing suit that I
got is this one and it looks pretty
small but I think he'll fit me um your
girls got nothing up here um so it's
this like pink hide I think it's purple
it reminds me of like a little kid
bathing suit doesn't that my got less
flirty yeah it reminds me of like when I
was like 5 years old look amazing so I
would wear like I would wear something
with ruffles and like pink and orange
rose yeah but I like that it's pinless
coming back so it has ruffles on the
sleeves but it's like a pink top sleeve
and then it is an open back which I
think was super cute and then ties with
a bow so if you can really adjust how
tight you want it okay so you're cute
right yourself I do I'd really really
like it and it's one of those that has
an underwire so it looks more like
you're wearing a bra it's not push up
and it's not padded but it just has like
that underwire I love that and then the
bottoms are the same and there again
cute like the ruffles on the side I
don't know I feel like I'm like 5 years
old again but in a good way
ok so the last thing is printers was the
last times when I got maybe a few
subscription I chose to try it
activewear from adore me and I was so
excited because it's really mark
redefined sports bras that aren't like
bad fitting honestly but I love their
sports bras so I got one that's like a
little tight and I have secured it like
mesh in the back and it's open in the
back which I love because like that's
such a fun little detail to go through
your tank top and the inside is like
this neon green material it's just
really cool and I love what I learned
out and it's super supportive leak you
could tell and it's got padding in it so
it's not like unflattering but leggings
but it comes with each other like a
drawing because they're like kind of
high-waisted so there's like they really
are decorating where we should love it
you know and then fall off you when you
like hang out you're like Americans
giving birth ease it happiness
so we'll do that like thank you for
making high-waisted pants these have the
same little detail on the band they also
have the same type of mesh material mix
of the tie dye so like the matches all
got a pant so it's mesh and yeah it's
kind of a quick google women that
they're waiting yes honestly about 100
quality you and there's a last thing I
got is this bra so I'm just gonna show
you guys I got this based on Katie's
recommendation actually she told me to
get this it's the t-shirt bra and once I
like is that it only has different sizes
so it's not just 32 ABC 34 ABC whatever
they have a 13 size so let's move on to
30 B or 30 a and I am like extremely
small and my chest so I got a 30 a
because 32 B's believe it or not stretch
out for me and they're too big and
that's why I just never wear bras
anymore it's like nautical shop or
anything like that it's just like a nude
t-shirt bra and its really soft so I
just got those because of Katie's
recommendation and adore me again like I
said it's a set so I also got me
matching bottoms nice cut a song it's
just a nude helping when I goes yeah
basic and I'm real happy yet no I always
need new things because it's wearing
white or anything like that shows any
sorta see to a spike is a LAN teller
yeah and you need a wear nude so that's
why I got that seem literally can never
have enough of those and I wanted to
match so that's located for our best
friend tall and guys liked it um where's
Kamiya wearing these all summer I guess
I need to find it a lot of time to go to
the pool because a lot of waiting but
