coming to you guys with a back to school
haul so this stuff I did not buy
specifically for back-to-school but I
really wanted to film a haul for you
guys because I have been shopping this
summer not too too much but I mean I
have been shopping this summer just so
you guys know I am in college and I am
also going to serve already so some of
these things are for a rush specifically
so not really for class and then some of
these things that might not fit high
school dress code but I think most of
them do but some of them might not so
that's just kind of a warning and for
you guys but obviously these are just
good it's summer like school clothes I'm
so excited to show you guys so yeah
let's just start this haul
so the very first thing that I got that
was not clothing related which I really
want to show you guys is this dazzle Pro
smile pass 7-day whitening system so I
have basically used all of them already
but I wanted to save one for this haul
so this is perfect for back-to-school
because it will whiten your teeth and I
think everyone wants white teeth for
back-to-school but I am super sensitive
teeth and I have tried crest whitening
strips and also professional whitening
at the dentist that they gave you with
the trays and these will be my favorite
because they actually whiten them and
they don't hurt my teeth normally I put
in whitening trays my teeth it hurts and
I feel like they're about to fall out
and I feel like I have like a million
cavities but I really don't and I think
it's just super sensitive teeth so these
have not made me feel this way and I
love so how simple it is to use so I
will show you guys it comes in this
packet and it has an upper set and a
lower set and then you just take it out
of the packet and it's so easy and I've
showed this in a previous video before
they are just these little tiny tray so
that they're kind of like like I want to
say like plasticy like very adjust well
to your mouth and then you just stick it
in your mouth so I just brush my teeth
because you need to have super clean
teeth obviously when you wait and so
that you don't get any like unevenness
because of the dirt on your teeth
basically and then you just stick it on
there so
and I ignore way to read it and then you
put it on your lower teeth the Popish
lice and I'll get back to you guys in so
now that I can actually talk I just
finished taking out the whitening strips
and I absolutely love them right away
and you don't see a difference like the
second you take them off but by the end
of the day you will see a difference and
if you are like me and you love drinking
coffee definitely recommend the
whitening strips because the coffee will
catch up to you and son I love whitening
my teeth every now and then obviously
you can't do that seven-day-a-week thing
every single week cuz one it's expensive
but I've got a coupon code for you guys
and two it's not good for your teeth
because it peels off your enamel so the
seven-day ones are good because they do
enough in one week and then you don't
need it again until a while those did
not hurt me at all and that was my
seventh day actually so now I am done
and my teeth our pearly white so yeah I
definitely recommend getting those I was
so happy when this came in the mail I
love a whitening my teeth and so yeah I
don't get sued that often but I think
white teeth are so nice and now I might
not have to like whiten them on my
Instagram pictures they might just
naturally be white so yeah now moving on
to the actual clothing items so the
first things that I got were workout
clothes and I got these from forever 21
I'm really going to try to start working
out next year so crossing my fingers
that it laughs but I got these workout
clothes for everyone there's so
inexpensive and they are really good
quality so I think that's basically
where all I workout closer and it comes
on now just because they're awesome
quality so yeah the first one I got was
this sports bra it's so cool it's like
the coolest design ever it kind of looks
like a bathing suit so it's black and I
have like two squares like cut out in
the middle I guess and then the back of
its show whoa I
love this sports bra I have been wearing
it a lot lately and this is what it
looks like I think I also wear it was
like open back things just look like the
back is really cool so yeah I really
like for everyone workout clothes and
the next thing from them I got these
athletic shorts I have been loving the
athletic shorts with the spandex
underneath because it's kinda like a
two-in-one you get their running shorts
and then you get the spandex this is
just navy blue and it has like colorful
spandex underneath which I thought was
such a good touch and then I got another
pair of basically the same athletic
shorts with spandex underneath but this
one has the pattern on the top and then
it has a green spandex on the bottom the
next thing I got are pajamas
so for back-to-school I basically where
it's only like three pajamas all year
and just kind of rotate washing them I
guess but this one is good for all
seasons cuz it's long-sleeve and fuzzy
and it looks like wild fox and loud
foxes the Contra dollars but this is
only like 30 I think for the spec maybe
cheaper it says when in doubt messy bun
and it is from Nordstrom and that they
have it super sizing these shorts so I'm
still wearing no intern because I don't
like wearing to how many things when I
sleep because they get really hot but
then I don't like being cold
nice so you thing out far from Free
People
I got them at Bloomingdale's I got four
of these things for $100 you guys will
have your mind of the loan when you see
what I got first thing I got is this
leather jacket which hello leather
jackets in itself are over $100 but yeah
this is seriously my favorite leather
jacket I have it in black and I wear it
all the time in the fall so I had to get
it in green because it was so so cheap
it was like such a discount at
Bloomingdale's so they have like
additional discounts and everything so
yeah it's just emerald green and it has
a hood and this leather jacket since I
have it in black I already know how it
fits I know how it looks I know how it
kind of wears out and it is a like ages
perfectly I seriously am obsessed with
this leather jacket it is my favorite
and I kind of
to get a little colder outside talking
where but then again I hate the cold so
I don't want to get colder but you know
you see my dilemma there's all these
cute ball clothes but then again cold
sucks yeah next week hangout is a rain
jacket so it is this rain jacket from
three people I thought it was really
cute it's actually a little bit small on
me which is bad but it's kind of just
small on the arms but yeah it's just
like cool material I don't really like
this material unless it's a rain jacket
so it's a rain jacket so it was fine but
yeah it has like it's a grid on it and
then it's bright orange and leaves like
little thing or colorful the next thing
that I got from Free People is this the
best and it's a really cool look I don't
really own a lot of s at all but I
really really like this one so it is
like a kind of a denim ish color and
then it's just pretty loose and has a
zipper right here it's just a very
loose-fitting thing I can wear it
unzipped which I think I would wear em
sick and then in the back I put a
super-high back so it's basically open
in the back I thought that was really
really cool and yeah I just really like
this feeling and I like it super soft
and flowy so that is why I got it and I
think I compare it with a lot with the
long sleeve and dark jeans and maybe
some booties I'm seeing it in my head
and I'm liking what I'm seeing so and
then the last thing that I got from Free
People is this dress it's kind of hard
to see on the hanger but it has this
slip under it and then it ties the kind
of looks reminds me of like Little House
on the Prairie or something like that I
don't really know why I love it I think
it's like so like forced you like make
like it looks like old tiny like I don't
really know what I'm saying but it's
really pretty
these next three things that I got are
for rush basically it's one of them is
not for a rush but it's for a video than
one we do for you guys for what to wear
for rush so I'm excited about that so
sneak peek into my future video this
dress is from Windsor store and it is so
so cute I will have
you link to down below for you guys but
yet this dress has it's just like plain
white and then it has all these like
cool
vibrant colors at the bottom of it and
then like flowers and then it says low
back so I thought that was so pretty I
love I'm obsessed with this dress and
it's like pretty tight but not too tight
I absolutely love this dress so much I
think it's gorgeous and it's definitely
perfect to wear my brush and then the
next two things we needed to buy a hot
pink dress and a teal dress because Ivan
Zeta so the we are like philanthropy is
Breast Cancer Awareness so that's why we
have a hot pink dress and then Vegas
colors are a teal and black so I had to
get teal in its pink dresses so for my
pink dress night this is the dress that
I got and it's really cute it's
strapless and just has ruffles at the
top or one big ruffle at the top and I
really like it it can get super girly
and I like the color hot pink some
people get kind of scared of it but I
love it
and then my teal dress is just a teal
shift dress nothing really to fancy but
I think with some pumps it could be
really fancy and depending on what
jewelry clicked so yeah I'm really
excited about these dresses I'm so
excited for rush you guys I was not as
involved in my sorority as I wanted to
be the first year but I think that brush
will kind of bring us all together so
I'm really excited about it the next
thing I got is also from Windsor source
so what's from where that first dress
was from this address it's so pretty in
it show me for you guys that know my
style was like the epitome of my style a
t-shirt dress that's black and white
striped I have so many white
things is actually a problem so I got a
black and white striped dress
shocker it's not at all I will show you
how many black and white red dresses I
have my closet someday you guys will be
like wow Natalie that is why why I don't
know I just love it so much I always
wear it so this one is open back which I
thought was cool or open lower back
let's the top of the back is still there
but then it's like cut out your low back
which I thought was a really nice touch
and yeah I just love black and white and
I
of strength dresses and yeah so I have a
problem and then the next thing is a
tunic that I got from Windsor storage so
so so cute this is what it looks like it
has like paisley on it like black it's
black I'm gonna painfully nice to put
it's called print called Paisley I think
it just reminds me kind of of like I
don't really know like hippie vibe with
boho but for fall like I don't I really
really like it I've already worn it and
it is really Cuban another thing that I
got from Windsor I've been looking for
forever I work at a boutique and they
have the cutest white skinny jeans that
are all ripped up but they're a hundred
and eighty dollars and I try justifying
70s I just could not give up my money
and she buys up a one pair of jeans so I
found these I went there for so much
cheaper they are white and ripped and
skinny so it was literally the exact
same thing and I tried both them on and
the other ones might have been a little
more stretchy but these fit like a charm
they fit so nicely yeah so I'm really
like I'm I'm very skeptical my jeans on
I'm not trying them on
just like jeans fit me really weird but
these were like totally fine in there
and all ripped up and I posted a picture
on Instagram exam and everyone was like
oh love your jeans so yeah they are
awesome I highly recommend purchasing
them if you are like me and I've been
looking for a white pair of ripped up
skinny jeans the next time that I got is
from brandy melville so you guys know I
love Brandi and I only shop there
whenever there is I'm like in a place
with a Brandis like New York or
California but couldn't use a brandy
melville actually just I'm carrying
their things at Nordstrom and I don't
think it's every north shrimp but the
one in Miami had brandy melville so I
went some shot from there first thing I
got is this tank top and I am obsessed
with the sea top I've yet to wear if I'm
super excited to wear it it's just plain
white and then totally open in the back
so I think he'll be super cute to wear
like a really pretty bra let in the back
or like a cool back with this so yeah I
really really like it and of course
brandy mellows t-shirts are so soft so I
really love my field
next thing I got from Randy I warned so
many times already it's a problem I got
this red ripped up shirt I like it cuz
it's not a crop top because I feel like
everything at Brandi is cropped and I
love cropped things but at the same time
for school and in college look I still
really like wearing like droplets
showing my belly in class I don't know I
don't like I don't know I just don't
like when it comes to class at college
still like at this red topics not
cropped and it's all ripped up and I
love it it's not like totally ripped up
and it does have some rips and it just
gives like a warning look which I really
like it was nonsense the next thing that
I got is also read from Brandi and it is
this cute tank top I love these tank
tops these I don't know if I can wear to
class but they are so cute and I just
love the way that they fit I think they
fit so nicely so yeah I'm really happy
that my coffees I love burning these
things out the next thing I got from
brandy is this a long sleeve t-shirt and
I love it I've already worn it I wore it
with a bralette peeking through and I
thought it was so cute I like it because
you can wear it in the summer because
it's basically like see-through with
like basically like you're wearing a
short sleeve shirts it's show so thin so
yeah it's super super thin but you can
still transition into fall and I love it
it's like this that California beachy
long-sleeve shirt look that I love the
next thing that I got from brandy is
this New York shirt so I really like the
shirt I bought it in New York and it's
just white with red in New York oh yeah
the next two things that I got are from
forever 21 and anthropology so the
shirts that I got from forever 21 looks
just like the red shirt I bought from
brandy it's just plain white and has
rips all over it I wear this with a
black bra I really like it was like a
black bra let because it kind of peeks
through and I liked that so yeah I
really like this thing like a warning or
risk t-shirts I think they're really
cute and then and then the last thing I
got from Anthropologie is this teacher
it's very unlike anything I have so I
was really excited about it and it was
called a mega discount so I have to get
it it is just a rosy color kind of like
Oh
like it's like a tank-top sleeve but
they have these like open sleeve and
with like flowers on it and crochet and
it's very different from what I normally
have so I'm excited to wear it with some
like jeans I think it's a little more
dressy
so that's what I like about it cuz I
basically have over like t-shirt like I
have very casual thing so I like how
this is a dressy add more accessories go
I bought some shoes from Windsor and a
bag these are my favorite shoes that I
have in my closet I think I love them so
so much like I cannot wait to wear them
oh they're beautiful ass booties with
eight like Miller heel on them and some
laces and they're just like please look
at the shoe how beautiful is it I want
it framed on my wall and it would match
my match type room I mean like I really
really like these and they let me like
have these on display in my room and
then a little more summery but oh my
gosh these shoes are so cute they are
these gladiator sandals and I have been
really wanting a pair of gliding under
sandals but all of them were way too big
for my legs and I know it's like oh my
gosh my legs are too small like that's
not really a problem but at the same
time I couldn't buy them so yeah I was
these were not too big because they were
adjustable over here so they weren't
like falling off because most of them
even though they're adjustable they
don't actually tighten these actually
tighten so that's why I like them so you
can make them super loose or super tight
if you want they actually do what
they're supposed to do so yeah I love
these sandals I think they are so cool
like I am obsessive then and then for my
bag I will be showing this any back to
school video that like back-to-school
essentials but I think I'm gonna be
wearing this to class when I don't have
a textbook with me which normally I
realized I don't care textbooks to class
in college so all if I need is like my
laptop a notebook and competant pencils
and
calculator so yeah business bag is
perfect for it and I thought it was so
cute it's with brown like Link brown
leather and then has gold stuff all
around it it's so big it's very sturdy
and it also comes with this which is
bakery a built-in pencil case that's
what I'm gonna use the dad so yeah I
think this will be my school bag next
year and I'm so excited about it and not
a date for the hall you guys I kind of
have all my stuff thrown around here you
