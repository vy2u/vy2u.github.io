filming a haul for you guys I'm so
excited to film this because i love the
only halls and they are my favorite
makes to film and i haven't been able to
because of school i am really go
shopping during the squares so
everything that i bought from basically
people getting in the school year to now
i'm compiling into a call for you guys
and I actually think it's a good amount
it's a good sufficient Hall amount so i
miss you guys and I'm just gonna get
right into this video so yeah let's just
get started and it's Halloween today so
I'm wearing a big orange sweater like
it's just the most comfortable thing
ever I'm just very cozy right now I just
showered I just gotta come sweater I'm
getting excited for home mean we have a
football game today but I'm not going to
it you know it's just gonna be a great
day now into the hall be very first sort
that I got is she inside if you guys
know she inside is as I think the actual
change their name to Cheyenne calm but
everyone knows ashing inside and they
are basically a super super cheap way to
get really awesome clothes and really
trendy clothes so yeah I will have them
linked up below and I'll have the two
things that I got link down below but I
absolutely love them I think they have
the cutest clothes so first thing I got
from them is this red dress it is just a
plain red dress and I really like red
because my school colors are red and
black so obviously I need red but this
dress actually has a really huge sleeves
which I really like it reminds me of the
70s so that is what i think is super
cute about it just has super big sleeves
and I think that is adorable and that's
like a huge trend right now and this was
this dress was like not even twenty
dollars it's ridiculously cheap
the next thing I got from sheinside is
another dress and this is also another
kind of fall a dress to wear with tights
or boots or anything really and it is
this green dress I don't really have a
lot of green pieces but I really like
the color green on it clothing so I know
this green just as flowers on it and
extensions as a waste and has buttons
down the middle and I like it some kind
I gotta keep it a little bit on button
just because I think it's cute it's more
like a v-neck so I'm like a bit
unbuttoned and cinches at the waist and
I just think it's so cute and it just
feels really soft and comfortable and
the material is actually really good for
how cheap it is it's not like forever 21
material or anything like that it's like
pretty good quality material so yeah I'm
like she inside a lot i will link it
down below so you guys can shop all my
things that i bought if you guys want to
the next thing that I got is american
eagle and sorry if you guys see the pile
of clothes right here um I just don't
know where else to put them so the first
thing I got is from Emory it is so soft
if you guys can't tell I've been really
into kind of blanket clothing and you
guys will be able to tell just anything
that's really really soft even if it's
not the cutest I like but a bit too cute
and soft you know I'm gonna buy it so
this was cute and soft it's basically
just a giant blanket wrap so you put it
on like this and it's just super cozy
especially for the winter and I'm just
excited to kind of bundle up in my bed
with this and I just think it's like the
cutest thing ever it so so I wish you
guys could feel things through the
camera because it's just amazing so it's
from aerie I would buy it if I were you
guys honestly it's tough for worth it
the next thing I thought I got from an
airy are these sweatpants again more
coziness so my camera stopped recording
I love when that happens I don't really
know where it stopped recording but I
just going to start back up with forever
21 but I just got any basic plain white
shirt at for everyone so it just is
plain white I maybe have about 20 plain
white shirts and you may be right
Natalie stop like stop buying plain
white shirts but I really do wear them
and I make use of them and they're just
really cute oh yeah i just bought
another one it was cheap so you know I
problems but this is whatever and then
the next thing I got routed forever 21
is this red dress it's so pretty i
really liked the crisscross miss of the
dress and i've been really loving like
some Crisco on top and I just wish I
picture on my instagram if you guys
wanna follow me on that but yeah i
really like it and I don't know how many
times I said how much I like it but yeah
it's just have sense at the top and I
think it's cute dress to dress up your
type foods whatever and I can layer it
in the winter I'm not worried about that
but in anyways I can wear it next summer
to I'm not like big into grab not
bothered by wearing the same thing
multiple seasons in a row I don't know
why people are bothered by that but
that's just saw me next door that I shop
that is Nordstrom and I got these really
cute big solo ease hands show they're
actually not floyd in like yoga pants
but they're tight at the top and then
they flare out at the bottom and it's
literally like around yoga pants while
you're going out so I'm really excited
about it and then the next thing I got
from workshop is this big while I like
you playing big it's nothing it's
actually pretty small is this plane ish
beige and black striped crop long sleeve
shirt it's not to crossfit like
it's just right it's like a really
really seen I'm shirt and it had buttons
down it and I wore it in my new york
blah but what I met my best friend stuff
on youtube so check out her channel a
little shout out her because she's also
have egg you guys should totally
subscribe next thing I got a Nordstrom
is my quite possibly my favorite thing
that I got at Nordstrom is this Vegas
all right the most comfortable thing I
ever seen in my life it's so comfortable
you guys it's oh my god I love it it is
just a big sweater that is going to eat
me up and you just most wonderful thing
I've ever put on my body I think it's so
soft the next floor that I shop that is
Windsor and you guys know how much I
love Windsor so I always tag them at my
pictures because there's the perfect to
store to do outfit of the day and
because they also repost your stuff too
so if you guys want to shop winter and
tag them in it like so chances are they
might be post your outfit of the day but
the first thing I got from them is it is
really really like the hot dress it so
it's tight and it's like a bodycon like
this and this
these have that crisscross material on
it but it's cropped right here so it's
off the shoulder I don't know why is it
crop but off the shoulder again I just
think this would look so good to wear to
one of my sorority cocktails I he'll be
so pretty so I'll coming with us to the
next one but yeah I've been loving and
just this dress I think you really cute
it's very bomb Shelly the next dress is
the one I post your picture on Instagram
so get out following me seriously its
own side but it is this dressing so
comfortable it feels like a giant
t-shirt and it has this crisscross
material in the front and it is just
really really cute and comfortable so I
almost matured so you guys can see what
it looks like on but again I've been
loving the crisscross material another
dress with the crisscross material it is
actually from Toby calm but it is the
stress and again it has this except it
has um actually doesn't have anything
underneath but I might wear something
underneath just so it's not like too
revealing but this was actually fancier
I might wear this also to a cocktail
it's just a fancier material and it's
more structured so gotta have that
material on like for that crisscross
pattern on every single form of clothing
obviously casual dress be like comfy
t-shirt dress fancy dress you know it's
just realizing how many things like off
with that if you guys can't tell if my
halls like I violent the same thing just
two different forms I've noticed that a
lot and the next thing and last thing
that i got from toby is this carolina
blue shirt and i go to NC State so I
don't own any Carolina Blue but I really
really liked this shirt and I figured if
I ever go there for a tailgate or
something I could do it and I'm having a
tank top on underneath this I'm not just
letting my babies flying out no not
happening and then when I got from a
store called altered state I don't know
if it's all over the US but I know it in
these tough places in North Carolina
super cute or encounter
one-through-three people they're a
christian store and they haven't a lot
of campuses around but they looking for
people and it's like really good for
home decorating I don't know I really
like it but again I got a fuzzy thing I
think this and a sweater from nordstrom
on my favorite sex that I got school
like home free buzz but I got this big
fuzzy jacket sweater sing our molino it
has these things that look like a
sweater I really don't know how to
describe it it's just a blanket
basically I just got a blanket to wear
on your arms that's a good way to
describe it and never earned Outfitters
I didn't get any clothes from there i'm
done with the closest I have a school
using green motion it's somewhere from
Asia I don't know where I think it's
japanese but i'm not sure but it is a
cookies-and-cream of lotion and it looks
and smells looks easy cream so as a
little black particles on the inside
which is kind of freaky that looks kinda
cool too and it smells just under these
agreements and makes your hand so shop
and then this isn't anything too
exciting but I got coconut oil for my
hair I know you're probably thinking why
did you buy that our masters he was
there it was only six dollars and it was
a big tub of it so I just said try it
out i don't know if this is any
different than coconut oil that i could
buy at my local supermarket but i just
bought it there so I'm excited to try
out the coconut oil rave it says have we
sat on your hair let me know how it
works besides because I got to start
doing some serious deep conditioning in
my hair as her shoes these are probably
my favorite and I Bobby's from nordstrom
too but they are bugs which is so weird
cuz they don't look like uggs they are
these stupid cool sneakers and they have
fur on the inside of them at the bottom
which I thought was really cool to bugs
oh yeah they just look like high top
black converse but they're leather
so they're a lot cooler but yes I really
really like these these are my favorite
shoes that I have gone this year so far
and then from Windsor I also got this
purse so I have been carrying this
around everywhere it's just be perfect
winter fall purse lb Dean of LBP little
black bag or baby Tripoli's base black
bag I just sounds really weird ok oh and
then the next things I got from wins
there are these killer deals they're so
cool they are just super super tall
heels and they're maroon which is overly
big color this season but yeah they just
are kind of like I don't think they're
called mary jane shoes or ever looks are
called but the ones that come out there
kind of i really don't know how to
describe it I horrible subscribing
clothes and then last thing that I got
are these shoes from steve madden
they're just playing black boots with
gold buckles on the side I just really
needed a mere plain black boots and I
liked these because they're like
anti-slip so I just needed some for the
winter walking to class because my black
boots were really really old and falling
apart so these are cool because i'm
steve madden and i got them of the
nordstrom anniversary sale which i'm
pretty sure my oven is a summer but I've
never shown these a halt before they're
still selling them so that's why I'm
showing no to you now thank you so much
