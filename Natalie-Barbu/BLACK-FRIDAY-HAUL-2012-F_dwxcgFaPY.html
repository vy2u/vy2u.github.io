filming my Black Friday haul and I went
hardcore Black Friday shopping so I kind
of have a bunch of stuff so I'm going to
how to make this intro quick so that
this isn't like a 30 minute long video
but um okay so first time I went at 12
a.m. we got there around like 11:50
because Urban Outfitters is opening so I
went to tell me I'm time all to Urban
Outfitters and the line was so long and
kind of like cut in front of people
because like we knew people in the lines
were like hey you know like I'm just
gonna squeeze in right here so that's
what we did so we didn't wait too long
but yeah so we waited there for about 20
minutes maybe in line for Urban
Outfitters and then like American Eagle
was open too so I went to American Eagle
at midnight and then we were done
shopping around 3 a.m. so we went got
home around 3:00 a.m. and then me and my
friends cuz I went with my sister and my
friends that time because my mom don't
want me driving at midnight so my sister
drove us and then at around 5:15 a.m. me
and my friends just headed out to the
mall again and then we stayed until like
10:30 so yeah and then from like oh and
I didn't sleep all night so I pulled an
all-nighter and then I took a nap at
like 10:30 when I got home to about 5
o'clock so I had like six and a half
seven hour now pretty much pretty sweet
but and then I still slept that night
like I got up I ordered pizza and pasta
stuffed in my face again and then went
back to bed
but so yeah I had like a ton of sleep
and everything like that like if I'm not
getting any sleep that night I had a ton
of sleep in the day to like make up for
it and like I slept like 10 hours this
month yet last night but anyways now
getting started into my college trip
going to Urban Outfitters it's this bag
and I got the same bag but this bag is
like stuffed as you can tell and the
sales they were so awesome it was fifty
percent all the sale items and like you
should have seen it was crazy you guys
like I didn't even look at any of the
other stuff because why would I look at
the other stuff if the cell is the only
thing that oh like get sale for it but
yeah 50 percent all sale items first
thing I got was this dress and it kind
of reminds me of like The Flintstones
the pattern and the print but I think
it's really cute cuz it's kind of like
goes like I don't know I just this is
the back of it so it's kind of like a
higher neck but just inches at the waist
and it's just like a regular dress but
the back of it is so
cute and it has like a hole in the back
so it's like a open back kind of but I
don't know I just really really like
this dress and it was only ten dollars
because it was 20 bucks on sale so I
only paid $10 for it next thing I got oh
this is I'm so excited to show you guys
this it's this shirt and I really wanted
one of these shirts before like this
kind of like clear see-through ones so
it's one of these like clear see-through
shirts that's really cute it just like
flows in the wind but the back of it it
has the holes right here like in the
sleeves or whatever like right before
the sleigh it's kind of like your
shoulder but like right back here I
don't even know any part of the body
whatever it's called
but yeah so I really really love this
and this shirt I only paid $10 for as
well because it was $20 and then on
sales turn and then I got this shirt
which is really cute it's a lace
long-sleeve black shirt and I really
like I have a ton of lace shirts but I
just love lace it's this long sleeve
shirt and of course I wear with like a
black tank top underneath but it's just
long-sleeve and lace and it's pretty
like normal on the front but then in the
back it has also like a little slit in
the back so it's really cute and it's a
little different than most of my lace
shirts and I have more in summer lace
shirts like I don't really have long
sleeveless oh and this was $15 because
was $30 so I'd hit 15 and then I got
these tights and I am obsessed with
tights and I don't have that many tight
so I'm trying to get like its money
types as I can for a cheap price and
these are only two dollars and fifty
cents so about five dollars in sale but
they're these floral black and white
yeah like black and white tights they're
really cute and they're only two dollars
and fifty cents so like it's really
cheap oh and this is where you make
those exciting item then I thought I
bought one of these like backpacks like
a knapsack backpack oh it's white with
studs all over it as you guys can see
and I've always wanted one of these but
these are always like $50 they're so
accepted like $70 I got this for $20 so
there's $40 on sale so I got it for 20
and I just so excited and I'm going in
New York in December so I'm so excite to
wear this around New York so I feel like
it's like a really New York I don't know
you know like when you see something
like that so New York
this is what I said when I saw this and
originally it was $70 you guys and I
paid 20 bucks for this so this is
awesome and it's like source so much in
it like it's an actually I could
probably wear this actually know my
backpack is way too full for school but
like you know what I'm saying like you
can store a lot of stuff in this and
whatever we go traveling with my family
like my mom always rings like the iPad
like everyone's foam it looks and snacks
you know and this is actually like cute
next thing I got were these leggings
from there and these are leggings not
tights cuz they have like the feet like
they don't have the feet at the bottom
yeah but it's this print and I think
this is really cute and I would what I
would wear these as pants what was like
an oversized shirt like I would not wear
it we're like it's just like regular
like a regular-sized shirt like you'd
have to be like an oversized sweater or
something but I just think that these
are so cute and I only got these for $5
and then they had these cute little Lisa
Frank things that you got for free if he
brought something so I took three of
them and then they have a coupon on the
back take 10% off yeah take 10% off
during your online checkout or prism
just keep on into your theme stores so I
got three 10% off coupons and lous√£
Frank Christmas birthday things I
thought that was so cute
Lisa Frank was like I remember everyone
in elementary school he's totally
separate I don't think I had Lisa Frank
that much bigoted but I remember one of
my friends was obsessive Lisa Frank like
everything she told me it was Lisa Frank
like literally her pencils agenda like
her notebooks her folders everything is
different so that was my first trip in
Urban Outfitters in the next trip I just
got a few things so this was like that
was 12:00 a.m. this is 6:00 a.m. and
what I got because they were they put
out more stuff at 6:00 a.m. so that's
why we went back but um I got this shirt
and it's just a plain t-shirt I just
like plain t-shirts I think you like
they're like staple pieces but I like
how it's just like oversized baggy like
you know just a plain striped t-shirt
and this was only ten dollars and then
the next thing I got yes the next two
things I got are very like summery I
could wear this no winter by layer but I
was obsessed with this one I saw
it is this tank top and it has like it's
like a button-down tank top but on the
collar it has all of these studs and I
was just like I am obsessed I need to
get it so I got this and it was only $15
so the routine then I have one of the
shirts since it's summer but I thought I
was way too pricey to pay $30 for a
Chain Chomp
so I got this for $10 now but it is
American flag tank top and I'm probably
won't wear this in the winter but next
summer I'm definitely moving this like
every single day
expecially fourth of July and like every
single American holiday I will be
wearing this because it's just so cute
and I love it and I wanted this in the
summer but I couldn't I was not gonna
spend $30 on it so I'm glad it went on
sale for only $10 next I went to was
American Eagle and so here's my back
there American Eagle I did not get it
that much that's where I got like to two
or three things but first thing I got
was a pair of jeans and this is my first
trip at 12 a.m. I got these for your
jeans and I just got these jeans and
they're really cute they're just
jeggings they're skinny and the back
pocket is just normal
yeah but these are like super cute I
really love them then they have seven
for 26 underwear so I just thought that
because $7 or $26 for 7 days wonder
wherever you kidding me guess you can
never have underwear and then 5/3
for a second trip to American well
wishes are like 6 a.m. I brought one
dress and oh my gosh you guys I
accidentally left my bag at the mall and
then I had to run back and get it thank
God they still had it oh I was freaking
out because this was like expensive but
ok so I got this dress and I am obsessed
with this dress just take a moment and
look how beautiful it is
it has this like sequined at the top but
it has like the flap so I don't know it
kind of makes you look a lot skinnier
because it has the secret on top but
then it's like tight and form-fitting at
the bottom I don't know I just like it
and it's good for girls with like a
small chest because it's not like tight
up there it's kind of loose up there and
has a lot of sequins so yeah I really
like it and I only paid $40 for this or
$45 lycra tax and it was seven it's $70
originally and I wanted to buy this a
while ago but I was like I'm not gonna
spend Saudia dollars on her dress
but now it was 45 so I was like I'm
gonna spend $45 million dress and that
was falling out at American Eagle and
then I went from Aeropostale and as you
know I like since with the 17th style
council then I'm in like they kind of
work with air possible too and so they
give me $50 gift cards each month too
and I do videos for air postel I think
those others say I'm not quite sure
where those videos actually go I do
videos for air puffs as well and so I
thought if you don't get cuts of air
post especially since it was having a
humongous sales like 60% off the whole
store is going like that
and I still spent like over $50 but I
only got four things there first thing I
got was this plaid shirt I am obsessed
with you guys like if you look at my
closet I have like 10 pod shirts and I'm
gonna keep buying more because I just
love plaid shirts and so I just want
this plaid shirt and the girl at the
counter was wearing it and I just
thought it was the cutest thing ever and
I really liked it especially cuz it's
red and black and blue and I just think
it's so Christmassy and yeah and it's
really like soft and I love soft pad
shirts oh and this was $45 but I think
with 60%</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
