that like this video hello everybody so
today I am filming my makeup look that a
lot of you guys actually requested it
was from last week's or not last week
the last video I posted on Tuesday you
guys had really asked me to do a makeup
tutorial on that look so I am doing that
right now
I wear this out normally on the weekends
or if I'm going out or anything like
that I don't really wear it to class
just because I don't wear that much
makeup to class but I have tried
basically all new products so everything
that you're seeing right now was it's
basically new like you guys have not
seen it on my channel before because all
my makeup tutorials I feel like are kind
of the same so this one's actually gonna
be different which is really exciting
and I will give you guys my impressions
on all the products and also if you guys
are new here please be sure to subscribe
I'm Natalie I post videos twice a week
but anyways we're just going to get it
right and do any makeup story okay so
the first thing that I do is I pride my
face so right now I have just clean
moisturize skin make sure your skin is
moisturize that is so important and I am
going to be using this Laura Mercier
radiance foundation primer and I like it
because it has a tint to it so it kind
of makes you a little more like glowy
from the beginning and it's a really
good primer I've actually liked it a lot
I've used this I think for the past week
and I have no complaints primers used to
break me out for some reason when I have
really bad acne but they don't anymore
so I'm happy with that and the next
thing I am going to be using is this
foundation stick from Sephora so it is
the make no mistake foundation and
concealer stick what I like about this
is that it is Foundation and concealer
in one so if I have any pimples and I
need pimples that I need a touch-up it
works but it also works with foundation
so I just draw like three lines on the
sides of my face and no like pretty
fashion or anything nose chin and then I
blend it out with my Beauty Blender it's
also really easy to blend which is nice
because a lot of foundation sticks
aren't I just kind of like rub my Beauty
Blender and like kind of had it all over
my face
as you guys can see it's a very natural
finish which is what I like about it but
it is pretty full coverage I would say
it's definitely buildable if you want to
add more and you definitely can but I
don't know I really really like it I
think it kind of makes me look more like
I'm not wearing foundation I just have
like a really really good like natural
even skin tone rather than cakey
foundation so that is always what I look
forward when I'm buying foundation
because I hate when you can like see the
pores and stuff like that like that it's
just definitely something that I really
really hate and to cover up any
blemishes or anything like that that I
have I am using this Laura Mercier
concealer and this is the secret
concealer and I am just applying that on
anything that I want hit in I have like
two little dots that I want to have
covered up so I apply it with a brush
and I'm just gonna blend it out again
with my Beauty Blender but I literally
just apply it like right on the dot that
I need to cover and then blend it out
and it works really well so I just press
it into my skin now I am going in it
with this Laura Mercier bronzer and it's
a really really pretty natural bronze
color and I am just going to apply this
right on my cheekbones with an angled
brush
as for highlight I'm also going in with
a Laura Mercier highlighter and this is
called the face illuminator in the color
addiction and this is this gold gorgeous
color it's seriously so so pretty and
I'm applying it with this fan brush I
definitely recommend getting a fan brush
I haven't didn't have one for the
longest time but they change the way I
do my highlighter so I'm just applying
it on my cheekbones or the tops of my
cheekbones
I always apply my highlight above my
eyebrow I think it gives it a nice pop
and I always apply nose highlight that
is literally my favorite let me know if
you guys like nose highlighter or not
because some people I think hate it like
they think it looks greasy I think it
looks so pretty and a little bit on my
chin and keep its bow and then as for
blush I am applying this from I have no
idea how to pronounce this brand it's
called ciaté cos I don't know um if I
am applying this really pretty blush
color and I'm just going to apply a
little tiny bit on my brush just so that
it's not too pigmented
now we are done with the face this is
the final look for the face and now
moving on to the eyes as for my eyes I
always start with my eyebrows so I have
always been using or not always but I've
been using this for a while it is the
benefit precisely my brow pencil so what
I love about this is that it has a brush
attached to it and it's actually like
really pigmented but not like you look
like you have black eyebrows I don't
know I really have been liking this one
more than Anastacio and I just start by
outlining my eyebrows and then I fill in
the inside but I always start with the
outside first now I'm moving on to the
primer for my eyes so I created my
eyebrows I just go on to the I shadow
and prime my eyes
do you hear my roommates in the
background they just got back there so
no I love them but they're so loud let
me know if you want me to do a roommate
tag because I think that would be a lot
of fun and they're like super funny they
took over my vlog one time so it's just
like I don't know I love them they're
funny so for the eyeshadow I'm going in
with this see ah tasty odds I have no
idea I don't even know how to have that
like there's an accent on the e I don't
know how to pronounce pronounce it but
I'm using this pretty fun and fearless
palette and oh my gosh this is my new
favorite palette I used to be obsessed
with Smashbox the I forgot what it's
called like the Smashbox like neutral
palette but full exposure palette but
now this one has been the best thing
ever so yeah I've been obsessed with
this one so I'm going to start off with
this color called skinny dip we're just
going to blend it in my crease with this
amazing blending brush that i just got
from morphe it's so so good so we're
gonna start off with this as our base so
I always start off with kind of like a
light brown in my crease I just think
that is what complements my skintone the
most so if you have like olive skin tone
or brown hair you're just a little have
a little darker features I definitely
recommend always starting with like a
bronzer in your base or like a color
that looks like that and just blending
it with a blending brush
I think that really makes people look
good and now for the crease I am going
to add this on unconditional color so
the one right next to it and I'm going
to be adding that into my crease with a
crease brush
and then I am going in with this super
shimmery color called shine bright and I
am going to be applying that all over my
lid
I'm going to go back with that very
first color and blend it again into my
crease just so that we don't have any
harsh lines or anything like that so I'm
kind of redoing the first two steps but
just with less product on the brush and
then again I'm gonna go in with my
crease brush and do that second color
and put that in my crease just so that
the shimmery color and the crease blend
together a little better and then I'm
going to be applying the first color
with my crease brush and just applying
that underneath my eyes and just kind of
blending it underneath my eyes so that
the color connects and it makes my brown
eyes pop as much as they can because
they can't really pop because they're
brown
but it makes them look a little better
now with eyeliner I am using a liquid
liner and I'm going to go in and just
line my upper lash line yeah
can I come in yeah so and we just
decided was calling that we're gonna
grill out you do once yes okay we're
gonna go by like something doesn't stuff
okay yeah I'll split the money with
Ellie I'm gonna attempt to put fake
lashes on really Natalie I might grow
something today okay maybe even ask you
I'm sorry
can I borrow something yeah no I don't
care okay so those are my roommates now
that the liner is done I am going to
attempt to put falsies on I have been
trying so hard because I really want to
get lash extensions but I have read that
they ruined your lashes afterwards and
I'm terrified of that and they're super
expensive so if you guys have had lash
extensions and have already gotten them
off so like you don't just keep having
them like you already took them off your
lashes let me know how they affected
them if they're worth it if they're not
worth it if you just think wearing
falsies a sign or whatever because I've
been trying to get better at them not
really great but I'm gonna try I might
be off frame I don't know um I also like
I'm kind of hungry so I'm shaking so
let's just see how this works
okay so this I'm gonna try to put it on
when you literally can't grab them he's
too much I am NOT a beauty group anyone
called me that like shows in this video
do you see that do you see them okay
little air dry so clear though so it
might be fine this looks so good and
that's why I'm just so messed up so
we're gonna take these off and we're
gonna apply mascara so I'm gonna be
using better than sex mascara and just
applying that to my lashes my normal
real lashes do false eyelashes make your
lashes fall off also when you peel them
off because my eyelashes seem like
literally like I have none maybe that's
just the effect like when you are used
to wearing falsies and then you take a
mop and then they look like this alright
now for the lips the final and last part
of this horrible makeup tutorial I
promise I'm gonna be getting better at
it and in the next video I'm gonna be
doing out how to put my eyelash
extensions tutorial I'm using this lip
liner for Loni London and it just called
slay all day and I'm just gonna apply it
to my lips
now I'm going to be applying this from
Ciotti
again from and it's liquid velvet and I
like just applying a little bit on and
applying it I think this is a great
transition for fall because it's a dark
neutral color so I think it looks really
good and it complements the eyes as well
so if you want the exact makeup tutorial
from my last video I had falsies on but
I clearly don't know how to put them on
so that was a giant fail but I hope that
you guys enjoyed this makeup tutorial at
least the rest of it I forgot to finish
off with my setting spray I just use the
Mario Badescu one I hope you guys
enjoyed this look now I'm like look all
sweaty from the setting spray but this
is a hot mess I thought this is gonna be
like a really good makeup tutorial and
it was a hot mess but besides eyelashes
I think I turned out fine give this
video a thumbs up let me know if you
guys have struggles as much as me or if
it's just me that's fine too but I love
you guys and I'll see you guys next time
