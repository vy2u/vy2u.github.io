filming a back-to-school makeup look
it's also a cat with me for
back-to-school my classes actually just
started two days ago so this is the look
that I've been doing I've been doing
this kind of in the summer too but I'm
definitely gonna be using this look like
for everyday back to school just because
it's so so easy I have it kind of down
to the wire now like I know exactly what
I'm going to do what steps what products
it's really really easy and I really
like the way it looks if you guys are
new here hello I post videos every
Tuesday and Friday starting this week so
that's really exciting so new school
year new channel kind of thing I don't
know I'm now on a schedule which I
really like and I just got like a mic so
hopefully my audio is a little better
and I have some like lights going on I
don't know if you guys can tell but yeah
if you guys like this video make sure to
give it a thumbs up if you guys want
more back to school videos let me know
in the comments and tell me which ones
you guys want to do because now I'm
actually like having a posting schedule
so I'm planning out my videos way in
advance I have some fun collapse coming
up next week which I'm really excited
about and also I felt like a lot of new
video content that I'm putting out I've
been planning my videos and I'm really
excited for it you guys so please be
sure to subscribe thumbs up and if you
guys want to see how I got this makeup
look then keep on watching so what I
used to start off my makeup is primer so
definitely make sure that you prime your
face so that your face is not oily
greasy and slipping off midday because
that would be the worst so even you
think this benefits that gap or
tightening face primer I absolutely love
it it just brightens up my face and this
is a teeny little sample size next thing
I use is my favorite BB cream which is
Maybelline the acne one it's like a 8 in
one beauty balm skin clearing Perfector
this has acne fighting ingredients in it
so that's why I like it but just for the
school she said I feel like I don't want
to go into the first day of class with a
cakey foundation so that is why I opted
for BB creams you're just going back
from the summer which typically people
have better skin in the summer
at least I do so that's why I feel like
we don't really need that heavy of a
foundation yet so that is why BB creams
are the way to go first day of school
next we are going to conceal so my
favorite concealer is the instant age
rewind eraser dark circles from under my
eyes this one has been my favorite for
years it is by Maybelline it's awesome
you just roll under your eyes and then
also this one from Maybelline and you
just dot it on any pimples or any
discoloration that you may have and it
works awesome then I go in with my
powders just to make sure that it's all
set and that we are setting our makeup
and it looks all perfect and nice so
that is why I have Revlon Colorstay this
one I put all over my face I'm actually
running out of it and then next we're
under the eyes I use makeup forever
translucent powder I think it just makes
it look very flawless not cakey and I'm
telling you guys like my makeup lasts
all day even in this 100 degree humid
weather which we have been having next I
like to go in with contouring I use
hoola by benefit and I actually like
using it with a thin I think it's a
concealer brush that I use and I just
put it in my like stuck in my cheekbones
put it in my little hollows of the
cheeks do that and then I blend it out
with a bigger Brooke with a bigger brush
so that is what I've been doing for my
contouring that is what I use the
bronzer on Hulu by then if it is my
favorite bronzer next I go in with my
favorite part of my makeup process which
is the glow kit by honest hacia I love
it I just got it it has four really
really pretty highlight colors and I use
the colors summer which is a white
shimmery color and then I also use this
purple one which is normally and I
really like this one for the cheeks and
this one for the highlight so I just
done like glowing all over next I just
primed my eyes with any eyeshadow primer
you don't need to be picky with
eyeshadow primer literally anyone works
then I go back with my bronzer and the
glow kit and I actually use the bronzer
to blend into the crease and the glow
kit for the eyelids I use basically any
other colors I sometimes use purple one
on my lid and then the white one or just
the white one really just depends
like a shimmery on my lid and a bronzy
look on my crease because since I'm
doing bolder brows I like having not in
bold that makes any sense but if you do
want to go bolder I actually used my
Smashbox full exposure palette and I
just did a dark brown color and put that
in my crease just to make a little
darker but you can totally skip out on
that step because I don't think it made
that make the difference next I'm doing
my brows so for my brows I'm using Brown
ways by anastacio I just get dark brown
and I fill it all in
I've been really loving the pencil way
more than the gel or anything else I
think I just get more precise and I
think it just looks better in general so
yeah definitely swear by honest osseous
brow this and then you guys know I love
Kat Von D so I use Kat Von D some liquid
liner it's the best liquid eyeliner I
just like doing like a subtle wing
because like I said my brows are really
noticeable so we don't want to do like a
dark heavy wing next to finish off the
eyes I do mascara so I just curl my
lashes and then apply my favorite
mascara which is better than sex by Too
Faced and yeah that's basically it for
the eyes then I do my lips I always like
to do the lips last just so that I don't
do like a crazy lip and crazy eyes and
crazy contouring like I like my lips be
a little more subtle and so I use it
spice by Mac as my lip pencil and then I
use an NYX or NYX lingerie push-up I
think that's the color of it it's just a
matte lipstick and this duo is awesome I
really like it it's more like a neutral
color on my lips so perfect we're back
to school and I just finished off the
look by spraying my all nighter makeup
setting spray by urban decay and yeah
I'm done with my makeup so hope you guys
liked it

makeup look I really like it I think
