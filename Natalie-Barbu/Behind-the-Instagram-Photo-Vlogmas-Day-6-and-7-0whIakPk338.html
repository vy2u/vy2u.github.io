vlogmas and I have a lot to do today so
I just woke up literally like five
minutes ago and I set my alarm for 8
a.m. and I didn't wake up until 10:30
and I kept snoozing it there was like 10
alarms in between I just like kept
sneezing I was like it's fine I'll just
wake up later I'll just wake up later
because I have a lot to do today but
nothing is like I have to do today
besides my video the rest is kind of
just like I shouldn't do today so I'm
like it's ok can push shopping and push
shopping at the shop but now I'm like
like I just don't open up earlier I'm
gonna go to the gym in the morning
because I saw my leave-in conditioner in
my hair and I want a shower but I also
want to go to the gym so I'm just gonna
work out it's my leave-in conditioner in
and then shower like washed off whatever
have to film and edit and upload my
holiday gift guide that we get needs to
go up tonight um so you guys will get a
little behind-the-scenes of its and I'm
filming that in my friend's room because
they have like cute Christmas
decorations it's absolutely what I like
have it be festive so film edit upload
that's gonna take a really long time I
have a paper due today that I need to do
but that won't take too long cuz it's
only one page and it's like a reflection
it's not like a legit paper so I have
that then I have to buy my friend's
birthday / Christmas present her
birthday's tomorrow and it's also non
Christmas I kind of wanna like combine
the gifts and then get that to her
tomorrow so I have to go shopping for
that today and then I have to I wanted
to start studying my exams Friday and
it's Wednesday and the fact that I
haven't started studying kind of like is
freaking me out so now in talking to you
guys let's get started with the day Jim
is complete so I just got done filming
so now I have to go and edit and I
filmed in my friend's apartment which is
actually where I'll be living next year
but this movie was set up so I just use
their Christmas tree and like I had my
light up there and then I filmed like
down there my intro and outfit shots
were right here because it's so cute
like look at this it's so cute there
they are
it's like just your head
and that's Julie my future roommates oh
my goodness you guys so I am actually at
a coffee shop right now editing the vlog
and I got to the intro and my volume
wasn't working so sorry I have
headphones in but volume is not working
so I was like okay I'm at maybe just
like villiage sometimes like I'm Peter
kind of lags like it doesn't like the
volume doesn't show up at first I was
like are gonna wait still don't work and
then I like went to where I was
importing it from like the original clip
not in Final Cut Pro no volume the
volume was on full like fully out for
you wasn't muted so I guess like my mic
wasn't fully plugged and so like it
didn't get any audio or something like
that I don't even know what happened
this has never happened to me before so
now this is a sponsored video so I do
have to mention the company so I'm like
okay um like what do I do because it has
to go up today and I have to mention the
company but like my intro where I
mentioned it was gone so I'm currently
I'm debating between filming an intro
like in the car because this lighting
isn't that bad or just doing like a
voiceover intro and hope it's good
enough I think I'll be good enough but
yeah so that is my life right now and I
just have to run out of a coffee shop
with my laptop and with this camera and
look out looking outside you guys he's
pouring rain it started pouring the
second I walked out the door with my
freaking laptop I'm in my friend's car
voiceover in her car and then I don't
even know what I'm gonna leave because I
don't want to get my laptop soaking wet
because obviously that's not good for
your laptop you know I might have to
leave you guys in the car if that's the
case just to risk less damage to less
equipment yeah so that sucks and that's
my life so you're watching my video go
watch it if you guys haven't already I
really like the red one I'm so
uncomfortable they'll get used to me
blogging around a lot more and like
being in my videos morning guys -
vlogmas I think six or seven I have no
idea um so yesterday I didn't close out
the vlog I really again didn't do much I
feel like this is a recurring theme in
them but I'm still in school so it's
kind of hard to make the vlogs
super
when I have tests to study for but I
actually love that you guys are so
understanding and I have so many college
students and just like high school
students with me in the comments so if
you are in college or high school or
know what I'm going through
please comment down below I would love
to like relate to you and just call me
back
it's comment down below I'm like
actually exhausted I didn't go to bed
until like 2:30 last night I was just
literally on the phone I don't know just
not sleeping I wasn't doing anything
productive literally just was not
sleeping and if you guys can't tell I do
wear hats a lot I wear hats when I don't
wear makeup because I have like if I
like any like pimples on my forehead or
something I don't want you to be able to
see them and I don't want to wear makeup
so it's just a perfect way to kind of
cover them up
but yeah I'm just going to get ready to
go to my review session I have like gym
clothes on because I'm hoping that maybe
after the review session I can go to the
gym but like I really need to study so I
don't know I'll see
but yeah so let's see what this vlog
takes us I do have one of my best
friends which you guys have met before
Julie she was in this blog it's her
birthday today actually so happy
birthday everyone wish her a happy
birthday and I'm gonna go to dinner with
her so they'll be exciting and fine
and I still got her present like I said
yesterday so I'm gonna have to go to the
mall today to do that so yeah that's my
date today so yeah let's go hey guys so
I actually have been blogging for a
little bit but I realized I didn't
explain anything from like the last time
I vlog to when I did my makeup anyways
I'm going to my friends a birthday party
tonight it's not really a birthday party
it's a birthday dinner actually we're
going to some bomb restaurant it's so so
good so I'm so excited and I decide you
feel my makeup look and just speed it up
for you guys so it's not a tutorial I
just wanted to look at how it looks to
do my makeup sped up so I'm gonna do
like 20 times so it should be only like
a minute long or less and yangshou the
final makeup because I was looking
really rough before I did this to go to
the mall right now to get to her
birthday gift but now time to enjoy me
speeding up this makeup look
so I just so just getting ready and I
did my makeup as you guys saw and this
is actually really funny because Windsor
sent me this shirt like freaking how
cute is it
it's like has like bell sleeves like
that but then like it's like slits in
the sleeves so when you write your hand
on your hip like that it's like super
cute and then it's also backless I don't
know if you guys can see it's like mash
it back anyways I was taking a selfie in
this mirror hello guys so I was took me
here and like see like as I'm doing this
and whatever like oh whatever
you can see like the hallway and you can
see some of my bed so my room is pretty
messy but like I didn't want to show the
mess in the picture so this is the
result I just throw everything on the
floor where you could not see it in the
picture and I literally just like moved
like that part of my bed right here like
just from here on and yeah this is the
aftermath I really gotta clean my room
so whenever you see rooms and pictures
and you're like oh my gosh goals like
how do they keep it so neat chances are
like half the time yeah that's probably
neat but the other half it's probably
just all tucked away somewhere else just
out of the frame the beauty of like the
camera frame I guess so now I'm going to
head over to the mall I was gonna wear
these shoes but they're like a little
too much because I think people are
gonna be kind of dressed casually so I'm
already dressed up Tuesday are so
freaking cute you guys saw them in my
fall hall they're Velvets and they are
from Windsor I'm obsessed with them but
they're really tall they're really tall
and on a clean hard to walk in and make
my outfit look like 20 times fancier
than it is and I don't need it to look
any fancier though so I'm about to head
over to the mall and then I'll show you
guys the birthday dinner and everything
that I got her I'm really excited
classic Natalie fashion instead of
studying for finals I went shopping
instead so I will show you guys what I
got when I get home right now I am
running late to my friend's birthday
dinner it started like five minutes ago
I don't think she's there yet I did
like I'm fine I'm actually not late but
like I'm gonna be late so I got to go to
that I'm so excited and I'm starving you
know when you're so hungry like think
that you just want like a little snack
like I was about to buy some food at the
mall and then I was like wait that's so
stupid because I'm just about to spend a
lot of money on a birthday dinner yeah I
will show you guys everything that I got
um I went originally just to pick up the
thing I put on hold for my friend and I
ended up spending two hours at the mall
shopping for myself so yeah
so we are at kalfus right now and we are
celebrating Julie's birthday she is 20
right now I wish I could have celebrated
but I have example gave us like a huge
birth free birthday cake it is half of
the birthday cake but it's like as like
