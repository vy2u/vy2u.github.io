vlog making sure it's perfect
to upload and then starting today so
good morning you guys oh my goodness you
guys so today I'm just gonna tell you
guys what I did and then show you some
really cool footage that I got so today
was the fashion show at my school I go
to NC State if you guys don't know we
have a huge fashion program here it's
called the College of textiles and it's
just like a huge thing at NC State we're
really well known for it that's not what
I'm in but that is a big thing here and
so someone had posted that they were
looking for photographers that could
volunteer to take pictures at the
Fashion Show and if you guys don't know
I'm trying to get into photography so I
had emailed her notes like hey like I
can do it whatever and so um I was able
to photograph the show and I was like
assigned a model and she I'm not gonna
give her her pictures and like send them
to her and then I was also taking
pictures just of the show in general and
it was so cool you guys like I mean I've
never been to a show before we have it
every year that's called the Reds but
I've never been and it's literally look
insanely cool it's actually like a real
passion show the people so it's students
that basically spend their whole entire
senior year or senior year first
semester designing these collections and
they made all of these themselves like
all of them themselves they had to show
all of these themselves that's just
crazy people are show beyond talented
like I cannot believe some people
actually designed and created that I
just thought it was insane like it's so
beautiful half of the collections the
person I photographed specifically was
my favorite
and like I'm not being biased here it
was seriously beyond it was so beautiful
oh my gosh if you guys don't follow me
on snapchat you're totally missing out
because I posted so many snapchat
stories like probably kind of annoying
but um yes so make sure that you follow
me on snapchat so you guys don't miss
out on cool things anymore but
I'm gonna put all the footage I got from
there and it seriously look a live
fashion show but I was there all day and
like I couldn't vlog like this like hey
guys this is what I'm doing cuz I was
like actually doing stuff like
photographing people all day so I
couldn't like just take out my camera
and talk to it but I tried to get as
much footage as I could because I was
there to photograph
I'll leave the like website to my
photography webs or leave the link to my
photography website down below but yeah
I'm exhausted um probably just gonna go
to sleep honestly probably I'm so so
beyond tired it was just like an all-day
thing but I'm gonna leave the link to my
website to the fashion like NC State's
Fashion Show website and so you guys can
see all the collections and the
designers and I hope that you guys liked
this vlog I thought it was so freaking
cool so I hope think I'd like it I am
gonna a busy day one of these days
editing all of those pictures like oh my
gosh but yeah it was so fun I'm so happy
I got to share this experience with you
guys and I'm so happy that I actually
did this experience I was really nervous
because I'm like a hundred percent an
amateur photographer I don't really know
much about photography there was like
legit photographers there and I was just
like um like I don't know anything and
there's like people with all these
equipment I have like my only like it's
a good camera but I don't even have like
I have like the kit lens like I was just
like so level one compared to a lot of
people that were like close to level 10
if not level 10 already so I was just I
don't know it was definitely like an
experience and I'm so happy I got it but
yeah well should I wear my hair like
this to hopefully you guys liked long
would say to and I'll see you guys
tomorrow bye
for us to understand as we want the
envious idioms after having a piece of
their collection feature and drugs
airbrushing and regardless if ever have
been anything for analyzer on senior
every moment of every time you on
butterflies you worked in that not a
dark could've cried time he'll to shame
about the memories the times Ben is the
happiest I've ever be I'm no regard for
the hand that he down me we're on course
but you've gone now without me as myself
this is pain I feel how these pictures
you would learn like an Instagram selfie
time to unveil all the reasons befell
peer power with the range of the roofer
Marcel shut the power on through I'm not
about you when the flame blows out not a
lot we can do I was honest and true
although a fun to see the pieces of my
life go whenever you leave broken booths
were fixed on remain in Evergreen he is
some capacity and my mind you forever V
making clouds in a missile discussion
gasps distant dreams give you nightmares
wishing we wasn't it takes mrs. saying
things I can tell you in person
say honest and break a promise tell me a
certain I've been hard since that summer
never looking down and you've been there
since day one so how's it looking now we
argue in the bedroom and in the
kitchen
hours later man I can remember
around that working shithole flats with
no carpets trying to picture the finish
line in the mind of an artist yeah and
keep a hold me baby I'm trying my
hardest leave my phone to light up when
I'm alone in sounds of darkness that's
where I can count all those who trust in
one breath but on me dad's new me you're
