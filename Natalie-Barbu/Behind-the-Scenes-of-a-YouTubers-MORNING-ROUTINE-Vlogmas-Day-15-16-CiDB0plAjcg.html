outside I went to do hot yoga today and
I actually forgot my memory card so I
could have blogged but anyways I can't
even blog in the studio and then
basically I did nothing all day I just
kind of like children relax with my
cousin but again I didn't bring my
memory card with me I'm so sorry I'm the
worst I don't think you guys understand
how fresher he thinks slow Wi-Fi is so
at school I have very very fast Wi-Fi my
videos will upload in about 10 minutes
like so fast so great awesome when I'm
at home I have the slowest Wi-Fi so I
try to go to Starbucks to upload just
because it's so slow at my house so I
took it this like speech test for my
computer and I mean I don't think I've
ever had seen worse results in my life
so the speed test for our Wi-Fi shows
are uploading rate as point zero six
megabytes per second point zero six
that's literally nothing upload or
downloading result is point two two
megabytes per second literally nothing
our national grade is an F - we have a
3% which means a 97% of people with
Wi-Fi have faster Wi-Fi than us and our
global grade is ninety or ninety seven
yeah and the ninety six percent of the
whole world has better Wi-Fi than my
house is so beyond frustrating I might
just like go to Starbucks and upload
this because it's a lot faster it's only
at 12 for science we're not planning for
about 30 minutes and it's only at 12%
I'd have to go to Starbucks I can't do
it here unless this will be uploaded in
five freakin years it's so so annoying
today's been one of those days where I'm
just like in a bad mood and it came home
and I just like got in a bad mood I
don't know why so yeah I'm just um I'm
stressed Adam finals are over this is
weird
I'm supposed to be like happy and like
relax and chilling like I'm not and then
I have to apply for internships like
guys life is just sure being an adult is
just stressful and I'm not even like a
full adult yet like I'm like 20 but like
I still my parents still provide for me
for most things like they're paying for
my school I'm at my parents house right
now like I don't
pay my rent but like I do like buy my
own things and stuff like that like the
plane ticket you saw yesterday that was
me like if I go on trips that's me if I
buy food that's me if I want to go
shopping that's me but like for like so
that's why I'm like I'm halfway adult
cuz I still don't pay for everything but
like I pay for a lot but not like most I
don't know I don't feel me but yeah and
I'm 20 so legally an adult so this is my
dinner you guys I'm eating tomato soup
from chick-fil-a I had no idea that they
had this but it's actually really good
and it comes with really yummy
Parmesan cheese crisps which super good
to put into there so yeah if you guys
didn't know you guys are trying to eat
healthy these are so good than many
sweet peppers and I have them with ranch
which like isn't healthy I know but I
only dip a little bit not too much
so I am about to go to Katie's house but
I actually you want to wash my face and
stuff and get ready for bed before I
even go over there because I'll probably
be there for a while and I'm just going
to get easy so like go into your best
friend's house like yeah baby guys love

don't get to see a behind the scenes
sneak peek of how I put my video I'm
actually kind of in a rush because I
have to upload this by today and like
these normally take a little longer to
edit but I really liked my last morning
routine video or I believe it's my most
viewed video I think and you guys seem
to really like it and I was more so like
