this is the start of a blog so I'm going
to be vlogging because I'm going to
Mexico actually I am incredibly
exhausted I think I've gotten like 20
hours of sleep maybe this whole entire
week I literally am dying right now like
I'm so tired I normally wear makeup to
the airport and look and try to look a
little bit better but I just couldn't
today I really can't um yeah so I like
dads for learning coffee yesterday it
was like running on coffee and I was so
crashing so today will be interesting
but yeah I'm excited to go to Mexico and
I can't wait to vlog for you guys so hi
guys hey guys so look it's all double on
it all good for us so that we can
doesn't feel like a vlog
I'm in Mexico my dad thanks many in
trouble for drinking in Mexico in the US
so we're eating coconut with chili in it
I've never had it my mom really likes it
he's not a lot to be gone
are you God I like about mine is like
okay it's a weird mix I don't want to
lie um
okay so we are at the breakfast buffet
right now and it's so big and it's
really different from like American
breakfast buffets because American ones
are all like egg totes bacon hashbrowns
like this one has that stuff but it it's
not that big all that simple guide to
like search for hashbrowns I like didn't
even find eggs I think they have to like
make them for you but anyways I'm going
to show you guys what I got it's really
yummy my god just a bunch of cheeses
which that I can find anywhere then I
got I don't know what this is it came
with the hash browns so I think it's
like potato with mint or with cheese on
it and then I got this thing
or feed us with frijoles and cheese with
beans and peas and then I got these are
hash browns it looks like rice with a
round and then this is I don't really
know what it is it's like a breakfast I
don't really know this is the Cabana
Chloe's in it right now so this is like
what it looks like and then here is the
beach so it's seriously like beautiful
the pool is right behind us like the
hotel oh yeah I'm loving it
pina coladas are so good this is like my
third one ordering it what's on baby mmm
doesn't it all whole and the Miami Vice
they're so yummy I am so I'm content
this is content living right now it was
early for the exhibition
yeah um cheers guys Brooke is like Lucas
was getting hit on by some girls at the
beach and they kept staring at him and
then they waved ah ha mom you can't Oh
guys so update nothing's really happened
but we're still we still at the beach
and I just want to vlog so yeah missed
you guys I've just been drinking all day
like not alcohol just like drinks like
liquids so it's basically why I've been
doing Mexico they just come up to you
and they ask you for all these all these
drinks and can't say no so right now I'm
having a frappe pretty good another
thing I think is funny that's like kind
of off topic and there's nothing to do
with what I've been saying but it's
funny when people think like if because
I'm his I'm like half Hispanic because
my mom's from Honduras so people think
that I'm autumn automatically next again
which i think is super ignorant kind of
because it's like not all people from
Hispanic you know there's like more than
one Hispanic country in the world it's
not only Mexico and like done in Seoul
to say like oh you're Mexican it's like
I'm not from Mexico like people from
Mexico or Mexican I'm not yeah it's just
a little piece of advice if you guys
consider everyone that speaks Spanish
Mexican now you know so I just got back
to the hotel we went to Starbucks into
the supermarket and I wish I brought my
camera with me but I totally forgot or
my iPhone but I just didn't because I
was like well I'm not gonna get Wi-Fi
there so there's no point in bringing it
them out I regret it because I didn't
vlog but anyway so we got back to the
hotel and they I see this
so it's strawberries which Chloe already
ate two of them so it's not that nice
but for three of them
okay but so they sent me since I posted
a picture on Instagram and I tagged what
hotel I was staying at so they sent me
this letter it says Natalie thank you so
much for sharing your photo on Instagram
please let us know if we can assist you
in any way enjoy your stay and then they
sent me like their two cards of info a
little envelope and then strawberries
like chocolate-covered strawberries for
free that's so nice of them like that's
really nice so thank you I will link the
hotel down below this is so not a
sponsored video at all but yeah if you
guys want to stay here when you come to
Cancun totally privately recommend it
they're really nice and tag them in
pictures cuz then they'll send you
Charlotte strawberries hi guys so we are
at the records of face day 3 of
stay three of Mexico and I'm loving it
so far we went to ask the last year but
I think I like this hotel a lot better
the other one was like outside of Kuhn
and it wasn't as that it was pretty but
it was like really empty kind of the
middle of nowhere so I think I like this
with no matter but yeah everyone's like
staring at me so this is fun
hey guys so we are it's currently like
noon and we are just in the hotel still
cuz everyone else is lazy and doesn't
want to get ready that's me like coming
I know I am already ready in my bathing
suit
just waiting suit I got really $5 at
holster guys holla for holster yeah so
close just like watching me love
record-high she's weird look how cute
this is guys it's a pineapple and has
pina colada in it but this is mine but
it's um an apple with pina colada in it
and then I think they can like shave it
and get like if there's any pineapple
actually in it I can cut it and eat it I
don't think there's anything left but so
cute and I just have like a little photo
shoot with it and everyone must have
been like what the heck is this girl

bathroom ready to brush my teeth and the
foot Claude's using this blue toothbrush
rubbing her retainers on it brushing her
teeth and her dirty retainers and then
she's like no no no no no it's my
toothbrush then what the heck is this in
Chloe's back

Spanish accent on point my sister just

relate it's always like super dark so I
just got back to my hotel room for
breakfast and just a little rant for you
guys when gross old men keep staring at
you while you're eating your breakfast
and they're with their wife and kids
it's just like why are you such a pig
why do you need to do that I'm a little
girl like are you kidding I uh makes me
so bad it makes me very angry and very
uncomfortable what I like doing is
staring them right back in the eye just
so that they know like hey like I see
you you're not discreet and I think that
that's the point they're not even trying
to be discreet it's disgusting
the guy was loose staring at me I was
eating smiling gross creepy old man
while he's talking with his wife and
kids my sister like looked to him like
shook his head like so uncomfortable I
just mmm
and then when I got up I saw him looking
again and it's just like you are like oh
so gross
