doing a makeup look and this is going to
be a chitchat and get ready with me I
also do not have any makeup on right now
so no this is not the look we are going
to start off with a very clean space I
just took a shower yeah my hair is still
like halfway wet and now we're just
going to do our makeup so to start how I
am using a clean face and I'm going to
go in with my Mac strobe cream for those
of you guys that don't know I absolutely
love this and I also don't ever start
early with a primer unless it's a
special occasion
I feel like primers are kind of like not
necessary um so yeah I don't know the
makeup I use if it's good enough II like
well applied all over my face maybe in
the summer I'll think differently but
right now I don't really need a primer
I'm starting with Mac strobe cream this
is in the silver light color I am
absolutely obsessed with it I think it
is such a great product and it really
really really really works so I highly
recommend it
you can mix it in with your foundation
or put it underneath kind of like on the
high points of your face so that's what
I'm doing and you don't even need to be
really like precise with it because it
is going to go under your makeup so it's
not like a big deal like I'm just kind
of putting it all over honestly like I
start at the high point I just put it
all over until you kind of look like
every small like I do is don't worry
like it's fine and then I blend it with
my Beauty Blender just to make it kind
of disappeared is the Beauty Blender
soaks it up I know that's wasting
product but you know what three letters
makes a little better that's what I'll
tell myself not least again making it
look better innocent so now I'm going to
go in with the foundation that I used to
use in the past and they kind of stopped
and now I want to revisit it see just
how much I like it again and whatever I
just like kind of trying new things out
so this will be Makeup Forever HD
formula this is a new one you can buy
this app with Sephora
and I don't even know what color I am I
was trying to look and like it doesn't
say I think you like wipes off for me
under or not I was trying to figure it
out and I I don't know what color I am
I'm just putting this on my safe and I
know I wanted W something I think over
the colors like W because I'm warm
undertones and then I blend it out with
this brush that looks like a spoon so
this is actually this brush is from Mac
but I know the artiste brushes or the og
spoon brushes so those are like the
better ones I think just because they're
like the original they're super soft but
I thought was it Mac and I like it works
just the same no I remember why I really
like this foundation it just like makes
me look really even like even on camera
did you read it for pictures I remember
that and it doesn't slide all over your
face so yeah I recommend recommends it
after concealer I always use my age
rewind but I really wanted to try this
Maybelline fit me concealer so I am
applying this just underneath my eyes
and they're like almost out of it but
okay
all right underneath my eyes I try to
make a triangle shape but you know what
you're going to blend it out so it
doesn't even matter what shape you make
I also don't like going in with super
light concealer I kind of like it to
match my skin tone a little more like
maybe a little bit lighter as you can
see but not a lot because when you take
pictures with flash it really really
shows and I think it looks super bad
whenever I see people taking photos and
they're underneath their eyes it's
bright white and I know it's because
it's up me as a flash like it brings
that out but if you just use a concealer
like it's going to do the same thing I
guess like a lighter one just brighten
you but like you don't need a bill five
shades lighter you just need to go like
two shades lighter I think this looks
honestly better than having like a white
strip underneath my eyes
then as you guys know I don't really
like using powder all over my face so
I'm using my Laura Mercier translucent
powder this is a go-to for me it's
really really good because it really
lets you like you can use this in the
summer or the winter because it's
translucent but it's not broad term
which is like make up forever
translucent pop translucent powder is
all white and this is like beige it's
kind of like a skin color so I like this
one better because again which like if
you take a picture with flash you won't
see it I mean you're not supposed to
with the other one but like you're more
likely to know because it's white so I
just put the rest on my nose section as
I wait for this to kind of just set I
just do this like wait for it to set
while I do my eyebrow so I'm going to go
into with my eyebrows and I actually
just bought this but precisely my brow
pencil from benefit highly highly
recommend it I think it might be better
than brow is because brow is from honest
akhiya I absolutely love the product
don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong
with the product the only thing is it
lasts like two weeks like it literally
laughs so little that like I always have
to explore buy another one and that is
really expensive so this one actually
have more product in it I think so
that's why I like it more basically the
exact same thing and it's cuter but I
love benefits packaging that is one
thing that is like they beat out all
other companies on packaging I don't
know let me know if you guys agree with
my brows this is my natural brow I
already have very thick and dark brows
so me filling them in is just to like
define them or enhance them not really
drawing them on so I just very lightly
follow my natural shape and fill in the
sparse hairs at the front
but honestly like I don't really have
like I have very thick brows so this is
just a like enhancing design like I can
go without doing my eyebrows but I
actually do like doing them because they
frame your face they make you look good
and like I already have a nice eyebrows
I want to make them as nice as possible
you know so yeah some people don't like
them
that's okay you can keep your comments
to yourself you don't need to lie to
them but you don't need a comment that
you don't like them because I'm not
going to change
I go over it with the brown drama from
Maybelline and this is just to set it
and I know like I'm looking at the
camera like they look so dark but I
think it's just cuz I don't have any eye
makeup on our face makeup so if I don't
want to makeup I don't do my eyebrows
this is only it's like we're trying to
be a little more dramatic and then I
just sit them with this so now I'm going
to brush all this off because I like
doing my eyes left no I know why I'm
just don't like doing them before I do
like my browser yeah my brother's super
dark today so well so as for my
highlight and contour I am using this
Maybelline fit me foundation stick I
like using foundation to contour better
just going to suck in my cheekbones and
draw on so I like using Foundation to
contour better because it is more of the
lendable I just will lend it out with a
Beauty Blender foundations one lendable
and concealer just because it is the
consistency of it if you would like just
in general foundation is easier to blend
it's supposed to be blended whereas
concealer is more in one spot it's not
supposed to go all over your face so
that's why I find that blending with
foundation is a lot easier
now my favorite favorite favorite part I
just got the makeup from milk I've
always wanted to try to make a product
I've heard such amazing things from them
and Sephora in New York they have like a
whole section of milk products and so
search try it I don't know if all
supporters do but I haven't to relax
look or notice it before also as far as
the lighting is changing it's like half
pouring and then gets bright and then it
starts pouring again outsides like
really weird this is like an iridescent
purple pearl color this is what it looks
like on my hand it's like very pigmented
very purple very shining as you can tell
I was immediately drawn to I'm at
justice on my cheekbones
so I just put on my cheekbones and now
I'm going to blend it with my beauty
blender because we don't want just a
line because that's never a cute look
for anyone so I'm blending it out and
this look is a little more extra but
that's me so as you can see it's just
like wow like super highlighted I love
it I'm going to start my priming my eyes
with the smashbox 24-hour photo finish
primer I'm going back with this milk
product and I'm putting this on my
eyelid so I really want to get like a
glowy look today so I'm just rubbing my
fingers in the product and putting it
all over my eye the thing about this
product about if it is hard to kind of
control because it is so creamy and so
it kind of like goes in your creases and
it's like very oily at least it feels
oily I don't know how much oil actually
hasn't it but it feels very oily so
that's why you can't kind of like just
wear this like it's going to fly right
off your face to neutralize it and make
it more wearable and a little more like
Popish I'm going to use my Smashbox
which was a full exposure palette and I
am going to be using this color to put
in my crease and then these two on my
lid I'm just putting this in my crease
this is to make it more wearable and I'm
putting it with a blending brush because
I just like the London versions more
we're going to go over with the second
comma third color in the palette and
just put a little bit on my lid because
I can tell that the purple is kind of
already off
so it's this on your highlight in points
for the most part but it is kind of like
it's not that reliable of a product so
it's beautiful but I don't think it's
that long-lasting but I have it
underneath my eyes so it still does give
it a purple undertone which is nice
because brown eyes and purple really
make brown eyes pop because if you guys
don't know nothing makes brown eyes look
that good because they're brown for
eyeliner I'm just going to go in with a
urban decay pencil and put this all over
my upper lash line and then I'm going to
go and put a little bit on my lower lash
line for mascara I have found a new
favorite of mine and it is the roller
lash by benefit again packaging of
everything that makes me look I'm
wearing false lashes and I'm really not
and I don't know how to put false lashes
on so I'm good
since I was saying often that the
highlighter does wear off a little bit I
am going to set it with a highlighting
powder so I'm going with my Mac finish
soft and gentle this is the best color
and I am just applying it lightly on the
highlights or the wherever I applied the
purple just because I still want the
purple to show obviously but I do want
to sit I'm also going in with the
bronzes in my Physicians Formula bronzer
and I am applying it gently where I
apply my bronzer again to just set it
after my lips today when I go out during
the day sometimes I don't want to put
anything heavy on so I'm just going to
put this NYX butter gloss I lift their
little chaps so I don't want to put
anything heavy I don't have to set prime
my face lifted so I normally prime it
with my rose water spray instead of
using actual primer but I am going to
sift my face with it
that is hands-down the best product I
absolutely love it Mario Badescu
vibrations Romanian and I'm Romanian so
that flies like we shared a special
connection
um but yeah that is it for my final
makeup look I guess I don't know what
I'm going to call this video maybe you
