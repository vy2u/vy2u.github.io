hello everyone so I'm so excited because
I have not seen you guys in a hot minute
I am done with finals I'm done with
college junior year so I'm done with the
year and I am actually a senior so
that's so weird thank you guys for not
being upside that I haven't posted in a
while and for understanding that finals
are hard and I just need to spend all my
time on finals so that is why I have
been absent for a while
but thank you guys for sticking with me
and hey if you're new here yeah it has
been around for two weeks but I would
love it if you would subscribe it's
almost summer and I'm literally only
doing YouTube this summer so I'm so
excited also I started a blog channel so
please go and subscribe to that because
I'm Daly summers vlogging and it's brand
new I put my first video with an hour
ago so please please please subscribe to
that of being the world meat comment
down below once you subscribe and let's
start doing our makeup so to start I'm
starting off with a Hydra blur
Dermalogica primer I will have all the
products linked down below I think
they'll just be a lot easier a little
bit on see how it feels cause
Dermalogica that I know is a great brand
but anyways tell me about your summer
and you guys what are you doing this
summer
you guys have a job or you guys on
summer yet still have any time left I
know most of my viewers are like in
college I think you guys are like this
thing that ages me so let me know what
you guys are doing and yeah some of your
plans
I'm going to go in with my True Match
Lumi foundation so this is the color
nice neutral as well to say that really
weird and I'm just going to apply this
on my community blender
so as you guys know I just started a
vlog channel and the thing about
starting a blog Channel I'm so excited
to start because I know that you guys
have been wanting me to start one and
I've been really wanted wanting to start
one just because I always feel bad when
I post a vlog instead of a main Channel
video because I feel like half the
people here are subscribed to see main
Channel videos which is understandable
that's why I am with a lot of people and
so I can make these blogs they don't
want to watch them so I wanted to make
one to put it in a place where people
that want to see my vlog can just go and
see them so and I'm going to be daily
vlogging so like if I turn to my main
channel into a blog channel then it
wouldn't have any of my other videos
anymore so I just had to separate this
going in with NARS concealer this is in
the color cuffs or medium one its NARS
custard and I have never tried this so
let's see how this is doing one of those
triangle looks underneath my eyes on my
nose on my forehead I'm not really doing
that much today I'm going to go and get
my Mother's Day present I'm going to
finish unpacking and think that's about
all I'm doing today but I just wanted to
film a video
if you guys do want to keep up with me
now please you should go subscribe I'm
so annoying
I'm totally gonna spam you guys on this
because it's new and I want to get the
word out but that's that's the last
you'll hear about it from now but just
comment below if you have already soaked
alright I'm a fan of for concealer I
really like it
I'm that's good now that's a good
concealer so since I and have came back
in college all my makeup it's still
tucked away film using Chloe's and I'm
using at some BH Cosmetics which I
actually got sent this it's not
sponsored but they just sent me some
stuff to try out so I'm so excited so
I'm actually not going to set my face I
don't think I really need to I think I'm
just going to set it with this instead
of this powder so I am setting my face
right now with mac's fix+ spray so I
don't really wear powder anymore I think
it makes you look a little more cakey
and if it's a good makeup product you
don't really need it to set normally I
just use Laura Mercier translucent
powder under my eyes that stuff is
actually great but since I am lazy and I
don't feel like unpacking to find it I'm
just going to set it with a fixed plug
and let my face dry off a little bit
while I'm waiting for my face to dry I'm
going to go on to my eyebrows and this
is my favorite part
so BH Cosmetics sent me these brushes
which are amazing like oh my gosh I got
sent so many brushes in here there's so
many of them so I'm really excited to
try them out I am using the BH Studio
Pro brow palette I'm really excited to
try this I love doing my eyebrows it's
like one of my favorite things to do so
using this spoolie brush and first
things first you have to brush out your
eyebrows that's just a given
feel like everyone knows that so I'm
just brushing them up
I also got my iris on recently so they
look really good without any makeup on
it miss angled brush and I am just going
to dip it in
and a pretty much dark shade so this
palette has it has like lighter shades
on the top then I have powders on the
middle for the top two rows are powder
and then the last row is a gel to set it
so I think I'm going to use maybe this
like medium brown shade and then the one
right under it let's see how this looks
oh that's dark I'm going to blend this
out that was really dark so not
expecting it to be a fat dork
oh it lends out perfectly though this
brush is super soft okay this brush is
extremely soft this is the softest
angled brush I've ever felt so it's not
stiff so you don't have as much control
but it's extremely blendable so
everything blends really easily going on
with the gel so i'm using the color gel
just to set it this is generally setting
it I think this is just adding more it's
kind of like a a paste-like it's just
going to add a little more color I think
but since it is a gel material it won't
let it move I guess I'm just like
darkening it up right now
this is kind of like a call because I'm
trying it on for you like a try on
makeup oh I guess I'm just going to
brush out my eyebrows one more time with
a spoolie brush just because I always do
that when I do my eyebrows kind of just
blends everything together once more
makes them look more put together I'm
going to move that onto my face so I
know we're kind of moving around and I'm
going to focus on for answers I'm going
to be using BBH Studio Pro bronzer
palette so this has a lot of colors as
you guys can see it's cream bronzer this
is what the how it looks like so it's
all cream colors and I'm really excited
to try it out just because there's so
many different colors that I can try and
I'm really excited they're really dark
but I think I'm going to start off with
the lighter color just see how it is so
I'm going to take the first color and
I'm going to put that on my cheekbone so
I'm just dipping my brush and kind of
like swirling it in there I want to
start off light because it's always
better to put less than one
we're going to go in with my beauty
blender also and blend it out because I
feel like that will just make it blend
better now if you status and should seep
in the bronze I'm going in with BH
Cosmetics satin bronzer this is a
natural finish bronzer this is the
packaging that it comes in which is
really cute and then this is the actual
rozzers is very reflective and this is
the color of it very very natural it's
not very dark which I don't want because
I don't want it to look like I'm going
out and like whatever so I'm going to
use that same brush that I've been using
and just blending it into my cheekbones
perfect so I really like how I'm glowing
like that make up the foundation really
makes you glow so I'm obsessed I always
just beat my face plate you do blender
after I do anything just so much blood
make sure it's blended I'm going to be
taking the spotlight backlight or
spotlight highlights six color palette
so this is what it looks like and it
just has a lot of different highlights
colors so this one kind of reminds me of
the Anastacio glow kit because this
color looks a lot like it kind of like
those four look clicks of Awesome feel
okay so I think I'm going to be using
this color and this color be taking a
color dream and dusting that on my
cheekbones oh yeah oh my god this
highlight look you can see that do you
see does okay
this video was supposed to talk about my
summer plans and all I've talked about
in my blog channel but basically all I'm
working on this summer is YouTube so I
decided not to look for internships this
summer and just make youtube my
full-time job while I can because it is
my last summer and I want to maximize
like everything I can with it so that is
what I'm doing so expect full
high-quality videos you guys is going to
be a really really fun summer and then
seeing the purple over color and I'm
kind of just putting that kind of like a
blush on hey if I'm thinking my Norah's
concealer again and just like gonna use
that as a primer because if you guys
don't know the white pack concealer
doubles as a primer basically the same
thing it's the same consistency for the
most part and it does like make a base
for your eyes the very neutral it
doesn't let your makeup light off all
day because concealer do not free
as badly so the good base for your
eyeshadow not freeze every time I wear
concealer my eyeshadow in a state I'm
going to be putting this crease brush
into my bronzer that I would use and I'm
just putting that in at my crease
because I don't want a heavy eye look
again I'm just going out for the day but
I'm going to keep my eyes very simple
for a lot of my makeup tutorials is just
putting a bronzer in wear eye shadow
like on in my crease like I'm doing
right now and I always use the same
bronzer that I was using for my face
because I really like it to match so I
like to kind of like matching matching
look that I'm going for it so that is
why I have been doing that and then I'm
going back with the alert color so that
is the purple color that I've used this
one and I'm going to be putting that on
the lid kind of for a sparkly lid and
again to match and I like how it's a
little pinkish purple so I can add a pop
of color I haven't heard that many
people using BH Cosmetics highlighters
but the pigment is in saying you guys
this pigment is like better than the on
a Cepheid loket oh my gosh Wow
I'm highly impressed and I'm just going
to put dream on top of that to
neutralize it a little bit and again to
get the matchy look and whatever I have
left over on my brush I put underneath
my brow bone and over my brow bone so
just kind of to accentuate the brow
plenty of mascara from using BBH list
lash mascara and it's in the same
packaging as the bronzer very very
bronze and reflective again since I
don't have my makeup I don't have my
eyelash curler so we're going to see if
this mascara curl your lashes
not the biggest mascara person which i
think is weird because every person that
does makeup is obsessive mascara my
lashes are already pretty dark and long
so if I don't wear mascara it definitely
looks different like you can tell the
difference right now like this looks so
much bigger than this but I don't feel
like ugly without mascara I guess and I
know that comes that's also like
confidence and stuff so like I don't
know I just like don't I'm not a big my
PR person and I hate applying mascara so
I spend the least amount of time I can
so like is it doesn't curl my lashes or
like look fine with like 30 seconds of
doing mascara or 10 seconds of doing
mascara I'm done because I know some
people can spend like five minutes doing
this here and I'm like I don't
understand how you do this I always get
it on my eyeshadow like without fail
there's mascara on my eyeshadow next I'm
using my lip liner that is the water's
lip liner from BH Cosmetics and it is in
the neutral color I believe oh it's in
the color earth so I am obsessed with
this color it's just a very very neutral
one and I've actually been doing this me
saying where I only wear lip liner and I
fill in my lips and that's it
so that is it for my makeup look and now
I'm just going to set it all again with
