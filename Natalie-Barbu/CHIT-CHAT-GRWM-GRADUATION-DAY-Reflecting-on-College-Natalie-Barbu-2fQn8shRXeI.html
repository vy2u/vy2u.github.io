that special or unique but I just really
wanted to film a get ready with me

this is like my last college video ever
so it's really really sad I'm graduating
from NC State go pack I am graduating in
a degree in industrial engineering for
those of you guys that are new here so
it's really sad that my days here are
over but my videos will get better you

the same type of videos so if you guys

planning for to like at least you

you won't want to miss those who follow
me on there and just gonna get started
into the makeup that's gonna start with
a primer I'm just using the spackle one
it's laura geller spackle it's like a
champagne II like glowy color but I also
want to make this video like a chitchat
one so I just want to talk about College
it's probably gonna be such a long video
but I don't care I'm going in with the
glow Shin from L'Oreal I use this and
like all my videos it's great it's kind
of like a dupe for the mac strobe cream
it's something honestly like it better
but I wanted to reflect on my years of
college so basically I am so sad that 22
and
see see if any of you guys are looking
into applying for colleges or like
thinking of where to go and you don't
know highly recommend NC State I
seriously loved it so much I just loved
the environment of it I love the
tailgates I love the people here they're
really really down to earth and like
chill people everyone I met for the most
part was super super nice like you're
obviously gonna have like people that
you don't like everywhere but for the
most part I just thought the environment
was such like a friendly open
environment which I thought was like
amazing I absolutely loved it so much
like I cannot be so thankful that I went
to NC State I was looking at NC State
and Clemson when I was deciding on where
to go to school and I'm like so beyond
thankful I chose NC State because
Clemson now looking back on it I just
like feel like I wouldn't have fit in
there like I'm not southern I'm not like
a sorority girl
I'm not that big into sports like don't
get me wrong I love NC State tailgates
but like I don't I never like went into
the football games like I'm just like
nzc was so much more for me it was such
a city vibe and like in North Carolina
and it was just so much better like I
don't know I just absolutely loved it so
much you guys go here or thinking I'm
going here and comment down below if you
guys want me to do any like how to apply
to college videos or anything like that
because I can still definitely do those
let me know in the comments yeah that's
the word I literally use this foundation
every single day of my life but I'm
using the fancy one it's so good you
guys
Rihanna came out with such an amazing
foundation for like a celebrity you know
when celebrities make makeup lines I'm
always a little hesitant because I'm
like did you really do anything or
didn't you just smack your name on it
but like I absolutely love this on
anything it's amazing let me know also
if you guys are in college I really want
to know that because I want to know like
my viewers ages I know that on YouTube
and Instagram I can see the demographics
and I had mostly 18 to 25 year olds but
I want to know exactly how old you guys
are so comment down below if you guys
are like freshman college in high school
still what age you guys are but yeah I
really want to know if you're wondering
I am 22 years old I just turned 22 in
April so I'm like it's weird saying that
I'm 22 because I'm so used to say I'm 21
and even then people are like no I'm
graduating with a degree okay like now
I'm taking NARS concealer this is like
the radiant cream I think or something
like that I don't know and I'm just
gonna put that for my under eyes because
I like feel like I don't get any sleep I
wake up so early and I don't want to bed
late but I just wake up I always wake up
before my alarm like every single day I
wake up at like 7:30 or 8:00 a.m. and I
just stay on my phone and I hate being
on my phone in the morning I just feel
like I'm like so unproductive and like
it's like hurting my eyes like the blue
light I don't know also now that I am
graduating and it is the summer so even
if I wasn't I wouldn't really be able to
do like college videos cuz it's the
summer time let me know what videos you
guys want me to see that would help me
out so much if you guys could just let
me know like video ideas and you just
help me out I will also be in LA this
summer so if you know any LA youtubers
that you think I should collab with let
me know I'm only living there for a
summer and then I have like my big girl
job afterwards and I feel like so many
of you guys have commented saying that
you like my videos because I'm relatable
that I don't like live in LA I don't you
know I'm not like one of those that's
like YouTube is like my life I guess
which I love YouTube don't get me wrong
it's literally what I am excited to do
it's what I wish I could do full-time
but I also realized that a degree is so
important um and can we just talk about
how thankful I am to have gotten my
education and I am NOT saying this
saying that you need a degree because I
think there are so many careers that you
don't need a degree like if you want to
do hair you don't need a degree if you
want to like do manual labor like you do
not need a degree and I'm saying like
working in construction working in like
the working in a hair salon working at a
management of like a boutique or
something like you do not need a degree
for that so I don't want to say that
college is necessary because I don't
think so I wish that as a country and I
was a society we didn't place that much
emphasis on college and this might be a
huge unpopular opinion but because then
I feel like people just go to college
they feel like they have to then they
get in debt because of student loans and
then they end up doing something that
they didn't need a degree for and wasted
so much money and are now in debt and
like I just think why do we feel like we
have to go to college like so many we do
not have to go to college I also think
well I went to college and I'm glad I
did because was what I wanted to do okay
like engineering I needed a degree there
are some certain things that you need a
degree for and I highly encourage people
if they have a desire to go and they
want to go to 100 percent go but I'm
just saying like you should feel
pressured that like if you don't go to
school then you're stupid or something
like that because I feel like that is
how we as a society especially my high
school I portrayed it like if someone
didn't go to college out of high school
everyone would be like oh my gosh like
that's so like like wow or like if they
went to Community College which is so
smart by the way because you're saving
money for the first two years like
getting your gen Ed's out of the way
people would look down on them and I was
always like why like why are you looking
down on them they're literally being
smart they're saving money like not
everyone has the financial means to put
themselves through college or for their
parents to put themselves through
college without debt your new ones are
real you guys so I feel like we should
do things to avoid them but my
translucent powder from Laura Mercier
I'm just gonna dust this underneath my
eyes you guys know the drill I do this
in like all my makeup tutorials I feel
like I like don't branch out but the
whole reason I do these is so I could
talk to you guys while I'm getting ready
like it's it's just fun for me okay now
I'm going in with Marc Jacobs dewdrops
this is so pretty I love the Marc Jacobs
two drops they're so so nice and I don't
think I can ever get through this bottle
why cuz I literally do like a little dot
every single time I put it on like Boop
like literally that much and I had this
entire thing
ever gonna go away it's not and I just
blend it out if you guys still want to
see the how I chose my major I stopped
doing those because I literally like
don't know anyone else with different
majors so it's just hard for me like my
friends that I had different majors in
they all came to talk to me like they
like were in my videos and now I don't
know people in other majors so I really
want to find more people but I feel like
those videos were so helpful because I
really wish I had something like that
when I was deciding my major I just
think it would have been like so
beneficial and helpful and like a lot
less confusing because college can
definitely be such a confusing place
like you're 18 years old and you're
supposed to make all these decisions
it's crazy I'm going in with hoola by
benefit bronzer where is my here it is
okay
now I'm going in with my an associate
Glo kit which I have actually been using
kind of recently which is I haven't used
this in a while now I'm using it again
and I think I want to do this color I
really want like a more like purple I'm
gonna mix these two together I think and
do a highlight like that so I'm just
first gonna put like a little bit of the
purple and with the other side of the
brush I'm gonna do like a light dust of
the other one and I'm gonna put it on my
nose this blush it's from BH Cosmetics
and I'm just gonna like lightly cuz it's
pretty pigmented does sit on my cheeks I
got eyelash extensions so I'm not gonna
put anything on my eyes because it
hasn't been 48 hours yeah and they can't
wet them so I don't want to like be like
taking off my makeup later today and
getting them wet so I'm just gonna leave
my eyes like this but my lashes look
pretty bold so it's fine
reflecting on college - it's just so
weird because I am never like I'm never
gonna be back in this ring I'm never
gonna really be in Raleigh like I don't
really have a reason to my boyfriend is
living in Raleigh so I'll come visit him
but like he's not by NC State like he's
in like a totally different part of
Raleigh so that's gonna be weird like
coming back but not coming back to
school like I will never be back here
again and it just hasn't hit me yet like
this is like my last money in this place
or like yesterday was my last night in
here like this is my last day in this
place and it is just so weird to me I'm
gonna do my lips now I want to do more
like a nude like a matte nude and then a
gloss over so I'm gonna line them with
this Urban Decay like it's like a
natural like a little darker than
natural lip liner
and I'm gonna put this NYX lingerie this
is in the color likley zero six with the
number
I love the formula to this because it
doesn't make your lips chapped and it's
such a thin formula but like still
pigmented and then I'm applying a tiny
bit of the Too Faced over it not too
much but just a little bit okay that is
the finished look I'm also in my PJs in
case you guys were wondering but I know
that I keep saying this but like it
hasn't hit me like the thoughts are
going through my head and like the words
are coming out of my mouth but my
emotions have not reached like it hasn't
caught up yet with my emotions so it
doesn't like I'm not sad right now but
like I know what is happening is sad I
don't know it's so weird it just hasn't
hit me yet I don't feel like it's real
that this isn't me like my last college
video it just like really doesn't feel
real right now so thank you guys for
being on this journey with me I really
loved filming this video I really want
to film the city oh just so I could
document it and so that you guys could
see a little glimpse to like the end of
my college career I guess and also I'm
gonna vlog it and want to put it on this
channel if you guys don't know I do have
a vlog channel and my sister started one
shout out to her sorry just come throw
that in there but anyways I just sort of
launched effort I have a blog channel so
you guys some subscribe to that you guys
like my blogs but yeah thank you guys so
much I love you guys I would not have
anyone to get through college without
you you guys seriously gave me such a
purpose to like keep going in college
and just like made me happy when I felt
like I was like miserable or felt like I
kept like dropping out or felt like I
didn't know what I want to do in life
and felt so unmotivated and yeah so just
thank you guys so much we did it and
policy guys as a NCS you alum</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
