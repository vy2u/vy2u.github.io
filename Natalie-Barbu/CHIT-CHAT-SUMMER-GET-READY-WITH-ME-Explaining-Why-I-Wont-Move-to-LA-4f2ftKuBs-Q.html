in the background though my post mates
will be here before I start the video
what's up guys it's Natalie here and
today I am filming a summer get ready
with me and it has been super highly
requested since I've been doing kind of
the same makeup look in all of my
Instagram photos and a lot of my vlogs
by myself promo
subscribe to Quogue tail it's been
asking for it so I'm excited to finally
film it for you guys and also it's gonna
be a chit checker any with me because I
like filling these way more I just feel
like they're more personal and I have
someone to talk to while I'm doing that
makeups if you guys are new here please
be sure to hit that subscribe button
down below
I post videos every Tuesdays and Fridays
and I just post like lifestyle college
videos but we're just gonna get right
into the video because I hate filming
super long intros so I'm gonna start off
with primer I always start off with
primer especially in the heat you
definitely need that I will say if
people say that la is like always hot I
don't think it is at all I'm so used to
hotter weather like I'm originally from
Miami and then I live in North Carolina
now which it gets cold in the winter but
like the summers are hot there and I
just do like LA I'm like actually cold
of the time well I'm not like sweating
that much here or tanning as you guys
can tell next I'm gonna go in with this
looming lotion and I am all about like
looking very high lighting it up and
like glowy like that's like my favorite
makeup look to do next I'm going to be
using a cosmetics CC cream I actually
just got this so this is not something I
have been using but it's something that
I have wanted to try so we're gonna test
it out on camera do a little first
impression of it hopefully this is my
color
it blends really really nicely into my
skin like it makes it look more natural
like less heavy which is what I was
going for because I normally and not
someone who like breaks out a lot so I
don't need to have like a heavy heavy
foundation besides this week I literally
just got two pimples this week right
after I feel my skincare routine and I
was like I have a kind of people all
summer and then I got a pimple so after
that I always go in with concealer I
just put it underneath my eyes and like
wherever I pimples to cover up anything
but I want to talk to you guys about
just like this summer in general any
future plans that I have or just like
how I've been liking it I've seen a lot
of your guys's questions like on my DMS
and the comments below a lot of you guys
it's kind of funny you guys are like
please don't move to LA like we don't
want you to move to LA which I would
love to know if you're one of those
people that doesn't want me to move to
LA comment why not not moving here I'm
leaving in August but I would love to
know what your thoughts are like why you
don't want people moving there so every
concealer I just set my makeup but I
want to let you guys know how I've been
liking it in general for me personally I
have always been one of those people if
you guys have followed my videos that
has been obsessed with New York I go
there all the time
a lot of people think I'm from there or
I've lived there
I'd have brands reach out to me being
like oh yeah we're looking for like a
New York city-based
influencer to go to this event or to do
whatever like brand zeal and they're
looking for someone based in New York
City and I'm always like wait I don't
live in New York City I'm not based
there and they're just because I go
there so often I go normally on average
I feel like it's like five times a year
like I'm their whole lot they more of
the stories I've always been a huge like
New York girl I guess I feel like you're
right there like New York or LA like you
can like both but you're like one or the
other you know and since I've always
just like loved New York I just
I like that like fast-paced environment
and like the people there I feel are
more real and like I've always really
really loved like the Huss
in the grind of a city environment and I
feel like here in LA not trying to bash
it I still really really like LA I just
feel like in LA everyone that you see
here it's like trying to be an
influencer trying to be famous or just
cares about like numbers like followers
and whatnot like that type of stuff and
I'm highlighting now sorry I'm like
trying to talk and do my makeup at the
same time which is so much harder than
you would think in LA everyone's trying
to be famous everyone's trying to like
fake it till you make it get a bunch of
followers really quickly become famous
really quickly like they work in the
entertainment industry which is awesome
but for me I like more like brushing
shoulders with CEOs and stockbrokers and
authors and writers and influencers and
people that work at like at a restaurant
all of that stuff like I feel like in
New York you get more of everything
versus in LA it's very like one thing
that you're getting and like I'm one to
talk as I'm doing YouTube you know but I
also like have other interests too and
you guys know like I'm an engineering
major I have a job lined up after
college I'm working on a project that is
gonna be sung so excited to share with
you guys oh my gosh like less I'm here
for like acting or singing it's not the
place for me let me know if you guys
have ever been here and if you guys feel
the same way I'm really happy I
experienced a summer here because now I
know that and I know that it might not
be the place for me and I just like I
don't know I just love that like great
of New York
people don't care they know their name
they just like want to make a name like
do something for themselves that's what
I really love and I really admire about
the people there of course every big
city has its ups and downs and pros and
cons and there's gonna be people like
that every me but that's just something
that I'm like I really really love about
the East Coast more than the West Coast
I guess next I'm gonna go in with a
little more bronzer just to make sure
like the highlight doesn't like go over
the bronzer because I'd rather have more
bronzer
now I'm going to move on to the eyes so
I'm gonna scoot to you a little forward
there you go I'm just gonna start by
priming my eyelids because we're gonna
do a lot of color on the lids so this is
like super important I also want to know
if you guys are East Coasters or West
Coasters or just where you're from
comment down below I so many of you guys
from all over the world which is
mind-blowing to me you guys if you're
watching this from anywhere other than
or even if you're watching this in LA
just calm down below I really want to
know where you guys are from and where
you're watching this video right now I
am gonna go in with this like low-key
colors what it's called and I'm just
gonna blend that all over my lid and
crease area it's gonna be a subtle like
blending color overall I am very very
happy that I spent the summer here it's
more eye-opening I guess I think I like
realized a lot of what I don't like
about it here which I think I'm really
glad that I did that before I let's say
like I decided to move here you know I'm
not like at peace here I know that it
sounds kind of weird but I just feel
like I'm so much happier or like more
myself in other places and I want to
have a whole video after the summer ends
about my thoughts living here because
who knows in a month it might change but
as I'm now kind of wanted to update you
guys kind of like a progress report like
a halfway mark good then I go in with
this orange color it's called vitamin D
I'm going to blend that out and just
start blending it into my crease area
focusing it more on the outside but like
trying to blend it just all over on my
crease just lightly with a light hand
and then I'm taking just like a flat
brush and with that same color putting
it on my lid so this little makeup look
is literally like the easiest thing ever
it's a very monochromatic which I like
there's no like glitter or anything like
that super super easy and I'm just
putting that on my lid and then it's
another blending brush I'm taking that
low-key color again and I'm just like
blending everything out and making it a
little more subtle and like lighter
because it's like very very vibrant so
I'm just Tony
get down with that color on top and burn
mascara I used to have eyelash
extensions but I don't have them anymore
so I just go ahead and curl my lashes
and put some mascara on
and then after that I just apply a
lipstick any lip color that I'm feeling
that day right now I'm going to apply
this Sephora collection one it's really
really cute it's the color or the number
six and it's called tan lines perfect
for summer
and this is the finished look it
literally takes me like ten minutes in
the morning to do it's so beyond easy
and also I just really want to give you
guys an update on kind of how I've been
liking LA so so far I'm glad I came here
for the experience and stuff like that
but will I be moving here in the future
probably not could change Never Say
Never but I just don't see myself here
I'll be an East Coast girl forever I
think so comment down below if you guys
like East Coast West Coast better which
one is your preference
why don't you want be moving to LA
you're one of those people but yeah I
just want to really update you guys and
fill my makeup on camera for you
everything is enjoyed this my post weeks
just got here so I'm gonna go eat and
I'll see ya later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
