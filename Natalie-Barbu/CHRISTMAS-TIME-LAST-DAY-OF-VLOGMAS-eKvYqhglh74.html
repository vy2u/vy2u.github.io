to this vlog actually a lot later so I
have been behind on the vlogs so I am
now posting vlogmas 24 and 25 which are
the last year Christmas Eve and
Christmas I am posting them a little
late and I apologize for that and just
around Christmas Eve and Christmas I
spend so much time with my family so
it's hard for me to like edit and upload
and even a vlog so I actually didn't
even vlog on Christmas Day but those of
you guys who have been sticking around
know that I already opened presents so
that vlog is down below so you can
actually see me opening presents and
everything like that and then the rest
of Christmas Day I just hung out around
with my family
we woke up late we worked out and then
we just kind of hung out and just spent
time as a family together so I just
wanted to also say that as vlogmas is
coming to a close it is so so weird
because I have been vlogging every
single day for the month of December and
so far and I just remember feeling so
weird like on the 26 being like wait
what like I mean I still do edit this
one but like I don't have to vlog like
that's so strange so just know that this
is my first vlog month and I have had
such a blast doing it and so I just want
to thank you guys for all of the
positive comments that you guys have
given me and just made me feel like we
are best friends basically I love
reading your comments I read them every
single day before I go to bed and
everything were you laughing it just
want to thank you guys for such an
awesome first vlogmas experience and I
will for sure be doing this next year I
had so much fun I'm actually going to be
posting now more normal content so leave
my video requests in the comments below
because I will kind of not vlog for a
while and now just get back into just
get back into like actual videos I still
will vlog if you guys want me to but
maybe not daily just because that's a
lot but yeah basically I want to make
this intro thanking you guys and some
people's meat the 24th vlog if you're
not subscribed be sure to subscribe
because now the Tuesday Friday schedule
will be back on so I will be posting
twice a week now starting from now on
Tuesday and
so yeah that's what's happening with
that make sure to follow me on instagram
subscribe all that good stuff you know
blog in the piece of my own apartment G
um yeah even my family loved the vlogs
so I know that they did and thank you
guys for being just so nice like
seriously nicest subscribers ever we
also hit 56 thousand so thank you guys
so much that's amazing and incredible
and can't wait to hit sixty thousand but
um I think that's all I had to say and
also again I feel like I don't have to
say this but I do Christmas is not about
the gifts like my Christmas was from
with my family it was my family that I
don't get to see often so that is what
it is about my brother is so annoying so
I'm just gonna end it now and then have
fun watching day 24 you're so annoying
it's just me my sister and my dad went
to go get some food but yeah we are at
Sunny Isles Beach and I don't know if
there's like sunspots on the camera or
what but I just got in the water because
I like the way my hair looks better when
it's in the water like I didn't like the
way my hair was in today and it looks so
much better if like sea salt and ice on
the water it actually really good I'll
probably get back in there in a little
bit and it's actually pretty warm it's
like 80 degrees right now so it feels
super nice outside but we accidentally
only brought one towel my dad has the
other ones and he's coming in a little
bit so I can't really lay out we're just
sitting on it yeah that's what we are
doing and the committee we had some in
here and let me know but it's like the
perfect beach weather and it's Christmas
Eve they get to stay 24 I don't know
but yeah this is the second to last day
of Watson so I hopefully you guys
enjoyed these I love making them and I
don't know what I'm gonna do without
walking every day it's gonna be weird so
yeah I mean I guess I could but like I
feel like I'd want to put out more
content not vlog so give me a good time
to focus on it but yeah Beach is
beautiful and if you guys have been here
I mean it was later in the night and we
are going to a Christmas party

jewel Windsor it is Windsor choker on
and then I have this jumpsuit I got this
jumpsuit I'm not kidding maybe like five

detail I love this choker I have the
