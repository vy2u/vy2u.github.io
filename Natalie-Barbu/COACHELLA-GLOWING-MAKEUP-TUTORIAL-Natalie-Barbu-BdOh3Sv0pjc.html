Coachella inspired slash music festival
inspired makeup tutorial I exactly am
NOT at Coachella this makeup tutorial
you can definitely wear to any music
festival and if you are new to my
channel hello hi I hope you thank you
guys subscribe I would love it if you
subscribe it without further ado let's
get started on the videos so to start
I'm going to be using my Rose Mario
Badescu rose water spray this is my
absolute favorite so good and refreshing
like it's so chic going to a music
festival they're always super super hot
so you don't want to be refreshed so I
would honestly just bring one of these
things travel size 1 and your music
retro bag and then maybe you guys can
like you know refresh yourselves in the
middle of it next I am going in with my
favorite primer and is the O L'Oreal
perfecting base primer this one is so so
good I love it
and I'm just taking some of that and
applying that on my face because we are
going to be doing double crying because
if you are going to immunise festival
you know it is hot then I'm going in
with my strobe cream and I am going to
apply this on top of the primer and I am
putting this on the high points of my
face and if you guys have seen any other
makeup tutorials of mine this is pretty
common like this is what I do collect my
cheekbones my nose the forehead and my
chin and I kind of rub it around that
area but if you guys have seen my other
tutorial this is pretty repetitive so
I'm gonna try to go through my face
stuff fairly quickly
I am taking my Mac Studio face and body
foundation use my fingers and I apply it
on my face and then make sure that it
gets everywhere and I'm taking my damp
Beauty Blender and I am blending out my
foundation with this to make sure it is
an even coverage I really alternate with
the methods that I put on foundation and
put things a brush sometimes I use my
fingers sometimes I use a Beauty Blender
you kind of just do whatever you prefer
and with my Maybelline age rewind
concealer and I'm so sorry if it's loud
someone's showering in that room this
isn't like my normal element right now
but I am applying this underneath my
eyes and since we're going to Coachella
we're gonna do some cool oh my gosh
really we are going to do some cool like
Indian tribal print on our face with our
foundation because Coachella you know
and again to make sure your makeup last
all day we are going to bake our
concealer I use the Laura Mercier
translucent powder it is the best
translucent powder ever and I'm going to
bake until that music it's out the
shower so it's not loud anymore and then
I'm gonna come back the film but yeah
I'm gonna fake that's for like a good
tip it's just because I don't want them
with that loud mist in the baths okay so
the shower finally stopped
so now I have let this stay on my face
for like five ish minute
guys we don't have to do that but you
know don't like a makeup tutorial and
it's too loud because eight people are
in your apartment you let it sit there
so I we rushing all of that off and then
that is really going to set my concealer
and make sure it doesn't budge so again
with product I've never shown you guys
before this is the Chanel Soleil Tanza
shalay Tanza Chanel is a bronzing and
makeup base so this is what it looks
like it's gorgeous I love it but Chloe
my little sister especially the woman
owns this and she uses it to contour so
I'm going to use it because I really
like the way that it looks and I am
applying it with a stippling brush and
just kind of like dipping it in here to
stipple it on and going to apply it on
my shirt
apply on the temples of my forehead just
a little bit because I need to contour
around my whole face or else it just
looks very hey I seriously love it oh my
gosh yes thank you Chloe for letting me
use it since again it is a very very hot
to act music festivals I am just going
to set this my bronzer with another
bronzer this is the Physicians Formula
bronzer and I'm just going to dab my
brush in there and quickly just brush it
up but I'm not adding that much this is
just to set it I'm going in with the Mac
skinfinish mineralized skinfinish in the
color global glow and I like this one
especially for summer music festivals
just because it is a gold bronze
highlight so it is going to leave you a
little bit more golden rather than
silver which I like more I'm just
applying it on the high points of my
cheek because this is the look that
we're going for we're going for more of
a outside desert look rather than
like princess below I love the little
nose highlight I think it's so cute
and a little bit of a champ I light and
after I felt like starting with of the
brow I go in with my benefits
precise paralysis is kind of like a
brown ways but I am just brushing it out
and then filling them in you guys have
seen me do this so many times and I'm
going to do it with these same exact
technique so I'm just going to speed
this up a little bit
I am taking my Maybelline brow drama
this is really really good it has a
brown tint to it so it defines that even
more and it's a gentle so it makes them
stay in place I am just letting them
brush upward so they can stay you know
words I got a new one though
it's basically now for eyes I have to
prime my eyes of course you guys know
the drill already at this point like
you're at a festival you need to prime
and you need to scent
I'm actually going to take my bronzer so
this would be Physicians Formula bronzer
and I am going to start blending this
color into my crease so for Coach all I
definitely don't want to do like this
guy or anything like that so we're
really gonna stick with Browns and
gold's that is my plan at least let me
know if what you guys would do if you
went to a music festival just lifts
music festivals are very especially
Coachella it's like the desert and not
like a night out you really want the
bronze to show in your crease but it's
kind of like an all-over look so does
that is what I did with that and I
really love how it matches my highlight
and it matches my contour so that is
what I love doing I like using the same
bronzer and just applying that in my
crease and then again with the whole
matchy-matchy I am taking the
highlighter that I use to meet the lamp
glow and I am just putting that on my
lid
and then whatever's left over on my
finger I was living underneath my brow
bone next I'm going in it with my NYX
jumbo eye pencil in the white color and
I am going to be putting this white
color in the inner corners of my crease
this is really to make it pop about
because again also get everything out of
your eye with an eye book in there so
you're going to put it on the inner
corner of your crease and this will
really make it pop and just be like
really different then you are also going
to put this white in the waterline of
your eye
finger and I am blending out the inner
part but a little bit but not much
because you want to make this more
dramatic than your everyday look you
don't want it to be like oh I'm
straightening it up you want it to be
white because it is a festival look it's
not just an everyday look next with the
other NYX jumbo eye pencil I am using
the color in a yogurt and it is kind of
like a kind of like us bronzy color I
don't know why it's called yogurt I feel
it's the white one should we call yogurt
and I am applying this all underneath my
eye
like a purple bronze now that I'm seeing
add a pop of color to this look I am
taking this blue eyeliner from L'Oreal
and it is in the color cobalt cobalt
blue and this is the color on my hands
so yeah I'm excited about this eyeliner
and I am lining my lower lash lines of
this as you can tell it definitely
completely changes your look when you
add that but then again to make it a
little bit more and natural I guess you
can say I'm taking my Urban Decay black
eyeliner pencil you can literally use
any one you want and I'm lining my upper
lash line
I'm one of those people that when I
apply eyeliner I have to have it on the
top if I have it on the bottom I just
feel like it makes my eyes look a lot
better also take the gold color that we
were using for the highlight in the
eyeshadow and apply it on your inner
corner I might also give it another pop
if you guys want on top of the white I
actually think I'm going to do that
because the white was not the lending as
well as I wanted it to so that conserve
is kind of like a base and then the gold
can be like the pop in the inner corner
and next for the last step for the eyes
I'm taking an eyelash curler and my
favorite mascara I'm using the roller
lash and I am curling my eyelashes if
you guys would like to use waterproof
just cut to kind of prevent it from
running down your face in case it rains
or if it is leaking like if you're
sweating and then it starts getting
above your eyelashes I don't know if
that happens to some people but you guys
can totally do that also I don't know
how to apply fake eyelashes that's why
we're often for this
that it's for the eyes I biggest unlike
that as far as lips go a liquid lipstick
is a must to make sure that it lasts all
day long so I am using the melted and
matte by Too Faced I love a good nude
lip gloss and since this whole look is
kind of bronzed and nude and I think
this one would go perfect especially
with the pop of color it won't look like
you're too washed out and like you're so
glowing so definitely way to go and
you've got to have a little of lipstick
just to make sure that lasts all day
because you still want to be reapplying
this
this one by two things literally lasts
all day I went to the beach and I ate a
meal and I also showered and it was
still on so I highly recommend it and
then when you're done up with your whole
face I would recommend spraying it with
the rose water spray once again sure
that it lasts all day long and also to
add a bit food fun like vegetable lives
to this look I bought some washi tape so
this is not for your face or anything
like that but it does stick pretty well
and I am applying it kind of on the
outside of my eyes and cutting it into
geometric shapes
this is the final look in here's like it
please give this video a huge thumbs up
I really love the way that it turned out
and I hope that you guys enjoy it too I
think this just adds a fun little touch
and if you want to make sure that they
last all dayy can definitely get some
facial glue I notice they have those and
I'm three guys enjoyed this video and
the thumbs up again be sure to subscribe
if you haven't and I will see you next
Tuesday bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
