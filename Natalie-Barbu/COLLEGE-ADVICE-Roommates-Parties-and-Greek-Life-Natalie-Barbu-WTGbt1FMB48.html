fashion so our channels are really
similar so yeah make sure that you guys
subscribe to screw videos or if you're
coming over here channel comment down
below because I really want to know so
we're just gonna dive into the topic
first topic on my channel that we're
gonna talk about is just dorm life and
roommates and that whole situation so my
very first year in college I am
currently a junior or going to be a
junior next week which is so weird I'm
going into my senior year so we're kind
of going through the same things right
now
it's really weird like I don't like it
at all but I mean it's fine I'm not Ana
dorm anymore I'm living in an apartment
so I'm sure are you yeah oh I have an
apartment now but we have been through
the dorm process yeah all about that
dorm life
my first dorm I actually filmed a dorm
room tour so you guys can see that I
lived in a very nice dorm because it was
off campus technically it was like
student dorm life so mine was a lot
nicer but it still was like sharing a
roommate sharing a bathroom um I likes
living in a dorm personally I thought it
was nice like you could meet I like
living I think it's good especially as a
freshman living in a dorm first I feel
like that's a really good experience
yeah I would definitely recommend living
in a dorm your freshman year because I
know you
just never experienced that again no
it's good it's good being sometimes on
your space might be a lot smaller than
you're used to and your closet might be
like that big make sure you've got
everything you have it have great way to
meet new people and for roommates like
selection you are not with your
remaining like you guys know I've had
different roommates every year pretty
much and I've had the same roommates all
three years we got along great really
best for those my best friends in
college we just kind of stuck together
so that's why I've had the same ones
going into my junior year we are still
living together so hopefully we don't
kill each other but it was great like we
met on Facebook and none of us knew each
other going into college like we made a
found out who our roommates were we look
them up on Facebook we found out who
they were and we stopped them yes and
then we became friends so many Facebook
groups you can join to meet your
roommate yeah and creep on each other
you can find a lot about it message
people on Facebook be like hey like see
one of you mates everyone right the next
one is college parties which I feel like
a lot of you guys probably want to know
more about it's kind of a big deal
it is yeah it's a new experience in high
school we did have parties at least I
did but it was like 10 people and that
was considered I barely went out in high
school I went to a small private school
so yeah I never really experienced
parties until I got to college
honestly it's like what you see in the
movies
yeah there's a bunch of people in a
house typically in a house yeah with Red
Solo cups in their hand
oh it's a real thing yes everyone plays
beer pong and then you're bumping into
each other people are spilling their
drinks on you yeah and some people are
really really drunk like every but you
will meet some of your best friends at
parties yeah a lot of people be open to
it
have to drink you can learn it and hold
a cup you feel pressure to drink just
home yeah like no big deal it could be
MC could be Phil's water no one will
know no one's gonna like ask you about
it no one's gonna care yeah so just hold
a red cup if you want to and if you just
want to seem like you are cuz that's
totally fine just because if you don't
have one I notice that people do
pressure you and it's pretty annoying
when someone having a while saying no no
no it's no way hold a cup for NC State
parties I go to NC State by the way
there's typically like at a frat house
or an off-campus house that's like
normally how it is yeah and so those are
disgusting where don't wear nice shoes
do not wear like we're walking shoes cuz
you most likely will be walking and
you're gonna be walking a while they're
gonna get ruined they're gonna get muddy
I don't know got done drinks spilled on
them um I don't know why like frat
houses just have like mud at the bottom
of them on an area half the time it's
disgusting I feel like it's telling you
that this you guys are so excited for
college like what you're gonna wear
they're being real with you so yeah
they're gonna get messed up your clothes
are probably gonna get ruined don't wear
anything over like 50 bucks but yeah
they are fun go out meet people but you
can also stay in if you don't want to
don't help no real pressure to go
nothing that you don't want to it's
college it's your decision it's your
life yeah and be safe don't ever go
anywhere by yourself if you are a young
girl especially buddy system buddies yes
so and even if it's like two girls
that's still like I normally bring a guy
friend with me to walk me down it's just
go out in groups groups are the best and
I don't know just late at night like
College University areas like a big like
people know that there's gonna be drunk
girls walking around so just be safe
yeah nothing that you're gonna be one of
those drunk girls but yeah how do how do
we describe this better be safe in some
enemies they've been sorry to go out in
groups yeah you'll have more fun that
way to you'll need a better keep tabs on
each other make sure you know where your
friends are don't let your friends go
off with anyone stranger that
don't know cuz you never know what they
happen exactly and normally in the
beginning for most people your roommate
is that person so just stick together
guys like so ditch each other no you
were in Greek life in Greek life I
actually most of you as know I was Ana's
ADA my first two years of college and I
say that because I actually just dropped
that and before you guys think that oh
my god it was awful and she hated it
like I really didn't I really didn't
love it but I didn't love it enough to
stay in it if that makes sense so it
wasn't bad it was it was a good
experience I made a lot of friends right
I can't imagine not knowing those girls
because I made I know now like 150 more
girls like that's crazy so going into it
it's a great way to meet people but like
it really isn't for everyone and it just
it's not necessary like don't feel like
you have to join so I know like for me
one of my roommates best friends joined
a sorority and she kind of felt lost
during that time because it was like she
felt like she was losing her best friend
and she felt like oh I would have to
join a sorority too but at the same time
you don't like there's so many ways to
make friends like don't feel pressured
join us or experience like it's totally
worth it if you do and it's just like I
I didn't go to a lot of things perfect
honestly I didn't put myself out there
that much like I didn't live in the
house I didn't like voluntarily go to
Zeta events you know kind of only went
to the ones I was forced to go to on
Glee and I met a lot of great people and
they were great but it just I ended up
looking back at it and I'm just like
okay my good friends are not in my
sorority and I never really go to the
house so why am I paying money so that's
why it's bad all right getting the full
experience but there is nothing against
them
I really do I did love my time there and
I love all the girls in it and the girls
that I did make friends with they're
like I'm still gonna keep in touch with
even write dropped it's not like one of
those scary things really oh my god you
dropped and they all hate you now no I
don't think anyone so at least try at
least go through the recruitment process
and get a feel for it and then you are
not a sorority so no go to her channel

your college ears to not be an authority
