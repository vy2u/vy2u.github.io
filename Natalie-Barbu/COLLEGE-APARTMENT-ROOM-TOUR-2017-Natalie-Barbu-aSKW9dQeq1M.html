am going to be filming my apartment tour
and I'm filling this on my vlog camera
so that is why I might look a little bit
different I hope that you guys enjoyed
this video this video was one of my most
requested and most of you two videos
from last year and I am in the same
apartment building from last year but as
different rooms and if you guys want to
stay tuned to watch my apartments warned
I am just going to get started into it
because no one likes long intros and you
guys already know the gist be sure to
subscribe if you're new here follow me
on Instagram tell me where you guys go
to school because I really want to know
where my followers go to school not just
I know I have a lot from NC State but I
want to know where you guys go to school
so make sure to comment that down below
let's just start it into the video so
this is my apartment
when you first enter I am standing at
the front door right now and I am just
going to quickly glance over the kitchen
so we just have a couple decorations and
the lighting is not that great in here
but we have our island with some bar
seating and stove sink coffee maker
toaster all of that good stuff we have
some shelves here for the spices and
yeah I really really like our kitchen
but my favorite part is not the kitchen
it's actually the living room we have
some chalkboards over there so here's
just a brief run-through of the kitchen
if you guys want to see a more in-depth
version of the kitchen you can watch my
room tour from last year I went through
it a little bit more over here is my
absolute favorite spot of the kitchen it
is the coffee bar so I think it is so so
so cute so we have a couple of
decorations up here we have the cafe the
tea sign it's all really really cute we
have our ground up coffee beans right
there
we got a sugar Splenda two empty
containers that we can fill up whenever
but I just thought that this was
adorable and then here we have some
Keurig some cake ups couple mugs some
tea and then we also have some more mugs
down
here's some more coffee and some cute
wine glasses so yeah this is like my
favorite part of the kitchen though and
then over here we have our dining room
table so this is just where we always
like hang out eat dinner eat breakfast
as a room and I think it's really really
cute my roommates actually painted it
last year so that's why it looks like
this but it's really really cute I like
it a lot over here is our living room
and this is my favorite part of the
whole apartment I think it's so so cute
so here's just a brief overview of it
and it's a pretty decent space we
absolutely love it over here we just
have kind of like a art wall art or a
gallery wall but it's a very very mini
mini gallery wall and our string of
Lights I really like the aesthetic of
the string of Lights I think it's super
super cute and our couch is constantly
filled with blankets so all of these
blankets are so cozy uncomfortable and
we'll just sit here and watch TV or The
Bachelor whenever it's on as a room and
yeah I just really think it's a great
place to hang out to have people over I
love the way it looks it's definitely my
style over here we just have a couple
candles and we are obsessed with
lighting over here is my favorite little
nook of the living room
so we have our record player that we got
from Urban Outfitters we also have some
fake flowers that we got from Michael's
a full length of mirror
and another little wall decor and over
here we just have a little greenery
which is really cute makes the room feel
a little more homey and yeah I just
think that this whole corner is adorable
and over down there we have actually I'm
pretty sure we have an Xbox which
literally I don't think anyone has ever
used we also have some records that we
got from Urban Outfitters we have some
DVDs
down here in case any of us watch TV or
some Wii games on there some more
candles and a Smart TV we love this TV
for watching Netflix it's amazing we
have a mini fridge because our fridge is
constantly stacked so the drinks that
don't fit in the mini fridge or that
don't fit in the full fridge will fit
and here so this is like orange juice
and some water at the top because when
Hurricane Irma was coming we didn't know
who was gonna hit North Carolina so
people started freaking out buying water
and we literally didn't get hit at all
so here we have Ali's room and on this
side we have Jamie's room I'm not gonna
show you guys those but if you want to
watch Ally's room tour each she has one
up on her channel so I will link that
down below but let's just go to my room
here is the entrance to my room I am
right now standing at the door of my
room and you walk in you immediately see
this giant shoes shelf and this fits
about 50 pairs of shoes and it's almost
full so that means I have a problem to
the other side I have my necklaces
hanging up with these cute little trees
um they're like nails into the wall I
think they're super super cute I kind of
try to coordinate the necklaces like the
silver ones over here some gold ones
over here but eventually they just kind
of all jumbled up together I have my
North Carolina decor right up there I
don't know if I love it but there it is
for now and then over here I have some
more necklace holders I do have a lot of
necklaces and I really like this is that
from home goods or from Target I believe
and I have a lot of old photos hanging
right here I just like kind of having
memories back from home back from high
school and so I thought this is the
perfect place to put them and then I
also have my baseball caps hanging
because I wear baseball caps every time
I have a bad hair day I'm obsessive
baseball cap and then if you go back to
my front door which is right there
across the hall or across the way from
it this is my closet so there it is my
closet right now I have my shorts and my
skirts and my denim shorts all up there
and then I have like my shirts jackets
sweaters all on the top and on the
bottom rack I have like tank tops and
jeans and I have like a duffel bag back
there and my dirty clothes bin so now
over here is my bathroom
so this it's a pretty good-sized
bathroom I'm really impressed with it
just a normal bathroom and then over
here I have this from Target thought it
was super super cute it's a great way to
organize all of my stuff because it does
not all fit under the sink so I love
love this it's assembled super easily
and it's pretty pretty cheap I have some
like everyday products up here that I'd
like to use some random different like
face and hair products down there some
face masks just anything really and then
over here I have some cute little wall
art it is the thing that was behind my
bed last year but now I put it in my
bathroom because I didn't want my room
to be identical as last year but it is
just the number 5 Chanel perfume kind of
like a vintage poster a lot of you guys
were asking where I got this last year I
actually got this at the poster sale at
my college so I don't know if your
school does that but we have poster
sales and this was one of them it was
really cheap like five dollars I think
now over here is in the main part of my
bedroom so I'm gonna give you guys a
quick overview of it I love my room I'm
really happy with the way that it turned
out so I have like a cute little faux
fur rug right there and over here is my
bed I love love love my bed I have my
Urban Outfitters headboard right behind
the bed and then I have my white
comforter this is a duvet comforter so
it's really really soft and I have a
blanket that I got for my birthday
actually for my roommate Julie which is
really cute cuz I has like puffballs at
the bottom of it and then I have this
quilt it's like a grey soft knit quilt
and this is from Target a lot of my room
is from Target you guys so bear with me
literally every single one of my pillows
is actually from Target I really love
the color scheme of my room I tried to
go with more neutrals and grays and I'm
mixing gold and silver so I really
really like the way I did that I think I
love this body pillow I think it really
like makes the room I think it's so soft
and I got it online I don't know if they
have it in stores but it's still from
Target on this side of my room I have my
camera which should be actually in the
camera bags
ignore that this spake succulent is so
so so cute I love it I love the greenery
that I adds in my room and I have a
photo frame of me and my boyfriend and
then I have this really cool gold mirror
hello guys its circular and this is from
home goods I actually have this in my
room last year and a lot of you guys
liked it I have my makeup storage so I
have a lot of makeup you guys want me to
do an organization thing for makeup let
me know I got this from Target as well
and on top of that I just have some
perfume I have my Beauty Blender some
random earrings and then another fake
plants and I also have my favorite
candle this is the coconut sea salt also
from Target I swear this isn't sponsored
but it totally should be now on this
part of my room it might be a little
hard to see because we're going against
the light but it is just my desk I don't
really do any homework here because they
have to go to like a coffee shop or a
library to do my work but I keep my
laptop my Bible some random books and if
thank you letters because you never know
when you're gonna need one of those of a
book my wallets a cute little poster
that says be still and know that I am
God Psalm 46:10 just like my pencils and
then I keep my makeup brushes over here
I'm trying to figure out if I should
move them here just because it would
make more sense and I'm trying to get a
mirror here so I can start doing my
makeup on this desk
and over here I have my photo frame so
this one is one of my favorite picture
frames I just updated the photos this
year and I love it so I just have all of
those you must have seen them from
Instagram if you guys follow me a lot of
them but this is from Target as well and
