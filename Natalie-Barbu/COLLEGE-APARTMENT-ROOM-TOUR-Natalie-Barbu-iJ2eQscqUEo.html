I'm coming to guys with a college
apartment tour and I'm really excited to
film this because it's been really
requested and I actually lived in this
place last year and I didn't do an
apartment or a room tour or anything and
I finally have it kind of all together
all super-clean and like it just looks
exactly the way I wanted it to look when
I was envisioning living here so after
about a year I'm finally doing an
apartment tour and if this is your first
time seeing my face

and I don't know I just think it'd be
fun to like have you in the family join
the I don't know I don't have a name I
asked you guys for names last time and
it was really creative so if you have
any other like fan family names like
comment them down below something to do
with Natalie I don't know I'm not I'm
not creative like that but I know you

a thumbs up because that is how people
find my videos that helps a ton so
please give this video a thumb up
and then follow me on all my social
medias and now let's just get into the
video oh here we are at the front door
and this is what it looks like right
when you walk in I'm standing right at
the front door so you just walk into the
kitchen basically and then there's my
room which is over there my roommates
room which is in that corner my other
roommates room in the opposite corner
and then my other roommates room right
here and here is also where like the
laundry is in the washing machine and
stuff like that it's a really dark let's
see if there's lights oh there so we
walk into the kitchen and then here is
where we do our dishes pretty
self-explanatory
pretty standard kitchen we have a
toaster oven we have some fancy knives
that we can like cut steak with and
stuff here is our stove we use this all
the time if you guys want to know any
cooking videos let me know I have no
idea why that looks like that that is so
weird because it
looks a hundred percent normal to me
okay that's like actually freaking me
out and here is our oven so pretty again
self-explanatory microwave which it's
also doing that that's so weird
okay here this is our island so we have
actually a chalkboard that we bought
this is a sticker so we just stuck it on
there and it's our chalkboard we and
then we have some fake flowers in a
mason jar mug which is really cute and
then we have like candles here we have
chalk for the chalkboard in another
mason jar and then this is where we keep
our fruit and then we also have some
chocolate in there I don't even know
whose that is but this is where we
normally keep our fruit here is my
pantry and it's really dark so so this
is my pantry if it focuses I just have a
lot of different foods down here if you
guys want me to do like a college
cooking video let me know it's kind of a
big mess but that's fine so now that
we're done with the kitchen we'll walk
over here to our living room see that is
my roommates room McKenzie and we have a
gold bean bag that she actually brought
I think it's really cute and comfortable
I think it's a love sack I'm not 100%
sure though and then one of us brought
this lamp I don't know who it was I know
it wasn't me and then we also have
lights hanging at the top just to give
it a little more homey feel because if
you guys can't tell this just like
doesn't feel like home like it's just
like it's not that homey I don't know if
this is what our living room looks like
and Rene brought this plant over here so
I'm not sure if this is gonna stay here
or if it's gonna go in her room but I
really like it as more of like a I don't
know how makes it feel more like home is
what it looks like from this angle and
then Anna actually my other roommate
brought this couch and the slip of it is
huge it's definitely not my favorite but
we needed extra space so of us McKenzie
I believe brought Wii and GameCube so
like that's really exciting
and we keep all of the games inside of
that the room also came as a TV which is
super nice so it came with this like big
smart TV so it has netflix on it and
Hulu and all of that if you hit guys
have an account you
use it i don't i barely watch TV but
that's really nice that like we have one
i didn't show you our fridge but here is
our fridge it is absolutely packed this
is what the inside of our fridge looks
like like what it is so packed over here
is my room so I have this tapestry
actually McKenzie bought this but she
didn't want to anymore so I just thought
that was a nice place to put it if you
guys saw my dorm room tour this canvas
was in it and I had made that so I put
that over there because it doesn't
really match my room anymore and the
first thing you see is my closet so here
is my mirror and I like I use it but I
don't use it for like its actual purpose
it has I don't even know how to open I
literally never use this well whatever
you can store jewelry in the back of
there and I don't think there's anything
in there so hi guys here's my closet for
my closet if you guys can't tell I have
like a ton of black booties I'm obsessed
with them I think I have a problem and
then here I just have all of my clothes
that I brought from home this isn't at
all of my clothes but these are the ones
that I brought and then my shoes are at
the bottom and I actually forgot my
dirty clothes bin at home so I'm just
using a grocery store bag for now
because I don't feel like spending money
on a new one yeah this is my closet my
bags on these little hooks because if
not I don't know where I would put them
this is what my room looks like so it's
super cute I really like my room I like
the shape of it so here to the side I
have like my jewelry and I hang it on
these little tree hooks that these are
all from Target basically my whole
entire room is from Target so I just
hang some of my necklaces on here and I
kind of try coordinating what goes where
and then I have this little thing that
says NAT on it I thought it was really
cute it's also from Target is another
one of the hooks and I should put
pictures on like little Clippy things
but I don't and this is from Target I
keep more my necklaces on here and this
one is empty because I normally keep my
hats on there but
I forgot them at home right here on this
wall I have this little birdcage that I
should be putting pictures on but I just
like I'm too lazy to go print out some
pictures and then I have a tapestry from
Urban Outfitters right here which I
absolutely love this tapestry I don't
really like bright colored ones so this
one was perfect
here is my bathroom so we open the door
to my bathroom and it's really nice
because we all have single bathrooms
hello you guys so this is it
I keep only like my essentials on here
so I keep my face towels I keep some
q-tips a retainer soap face wash
moisturizer toothbrush toothpaste and my
makeup remover wipes makeup remover
wipes and then under here it's actually
such a mess like I just throw everything
in there like it's so messy but I keep
everything that I use like post shower
cleaning supplies hair products just
like everything is under there
we bought this rug I really really like
it it's super cute it's white and it has
like silver details which I don't know
if you guys can see but it's really nice
and then at the foot of my shower I have
another rug or mats bath mat just
because that one absorbs more water and
then my towels I really liked them
they're like a taupe color and then I
had my pink bunny robe right there that
I hang up my toilet I just got this
toilet lid it reminds me of a grandma
but like I actually really like it for
my bathroom back to my room so this is
my bed which is probably what you guys
all wanted to see like my main room so I
love it so much I think it's really
really cute I like the way I decorated
it so at the foot of my bed I have this
blanket and it's just like a fur blanket
from Target it's so so so soft and I
really like in love with these like fur
blankets and then under here I actually
have another quilt it's like a quilt it
actually fits the whole queen bed size
it's like for a queen but I have it
folded up and I just really like the
color of it and that is also from Target
over here I just have a picture of North
Carolina hanging out basically or it's
not a picture but like a little
decoration because I'm from North
Carolina and that's where I go to school
I go to NC State
over here sadly my thing fell off so
there's another one of these that's
supposed to be there but it fell off and
like I can't put it back on
that is why that's really ugly in there
but that it supposed to be another one
of these and it was really cute when I
had it all here I have a sign that I
wrote my initial on it I really like it
I like the whole black and gold that is
from Target and that is also from Target
I don't know where the North Carolina
things from it's like one of my favorite
parts of my room so it's really really
cute I have picture frames that I
actually have for my freshman year of
college they're all from me in high
school so I kind of got to update those
because I'm a junior and those really
three years old which is so weird
and then I have this that says where he
ends were faith begins someone got that
for me as a gift then I have my perfumes
right here with my initial on it on the
tray which my big actually got me it
when I was in a sorority and then I have
a candle this candle is from Target and
it smells so good and then this is also
from Target that's like fake plan I just
think it makes the room look so much
more like cozy and homey and I'm like in
love with it
you just really really cute and then
these this actually came with my room
which matches my room perfectly so I'm
really happy that they gave us like cute
things so I'm not going to go through
all of them but like I mainly just have
like miscellaneous things right up there
bras and underwear t-shirts and then
shorts you have a fan because sometimes
it gets pretty hot in my room and I just
wanted a fan I don't know I'm pretty
self-explanatory because where my desk
is so you walk over here and I actually
have this to hold my jewelry again I
have a lot of jewelry place holders in
my room I just think it's like they're
like cute decorations I got this also
from Target and this is mainly like my
gold jewelry that I hang up here I just
kind of want it to look good because
this is like a decoration in itself then
I have this from I believe it's from
Target as well I don't know it just
match my room and I have Bible verses
and things that I just want to remember
on my wall so that's why I put them in
sticky notes on there I think um they're
just good reminders then I have this
lamp which is also from Target I
definitely need it because it gets super
dark in my room because I have a small
window and we're not facing the Sun when
it's setting so that's kind of annoying
I have my speaker's over there some
post-it notes my makeup that I do I do
it right here so here have my makeup
drawers from the Container Store and
then I have this makeup tray it's
actually from Target I believe it's like
a pencil holder but I used it to store
my makeup palettes and my brushes this
is also from Target and it's just
another like fake plant which i think is
really cute I have a mirror because I do
my makeup here obviously I have some
notebooks that I just like doodling in
or writing in I don't know I really like
doing that stuff especially if I'm doing
like morning devotionals and then I have
a place do you like put my pencils and
scissors and highlighters and all that
stuff that's also from Target and then
of course I have the September issue of
Vogue threat with Kendall Jenner on it
I'm obsessed I'm going to start
collecting the September issues because
I don't really list read vogue but like
the September issue is a huge deal so
I'm going to start collecting those and
I just think to look so good and it
honestly like matches my room so I'm not
complaining here on this wall so I have
my two winter hats which I actually like
they're not winter hats but like I
normally wear them in like the fall
because they're more fall
looking like you don't wear those in the
summer and so then I have that just like
push pinned on the wall and I like them
because they're honestly like a cute
decoration and then I have this map so I
got this from Urban Outfitters and you
just scratch off places you've been
which it looks like I haven't been
anywhere but I really haven't traveled
outside of the country like two too much
only a little bit and in the US like I
might just scribble out the whole u.s.
because I don't know it's really small
but yeah I really like it I like it cuz
it's gold anyway and I went to a free
chainsmokers concert actually they held
a free one here in Raleigh so I went to
that and I got a little pass and I just
held it up because it's a good memory
over here you probably remember it from
my dorm room tour if you remember that
or if you ever saw that I'll have that
link down below so here I just have a
like picture frame from Target all my
high school pictures again these are
super old pictures and then over here I
have a picture frame with a little paper
in it that says be still and know that I
am God Psalm 46:10 so it's a really good
first and it matched my room and it's
really cute and then over here I
actually made this I got the things from
Target and Michaels and I just put a
bunch of like fake flowers into one of
those frames that like lets you put
stuff in it and then over here I
actually just got this like last week
and it is from a poster sale at my
school so I have no idea like where you
can find it but I thought it was so so
cute it actually like makes my room and
I think it's so cute and over there my
boyfriend actually got that for me for
Christmas and it's just some lights and
then you can plug them in and turn them
on and you can put stickers on them and
it's Scrabble so I think that's really
cute
and then over here I have a windbreaker
or no windbreaker with a heck that's a
jacket wind oh my gosh what are these
called I like drawing a blank here I
don't remember what these are called
windseeker wind what I don't know
there's probably not even oh a
dreamcatcher I'm stupid okay I have a
dreamcatcher over here and it's gold and
it is from alters estate and I think
it's cute and it just added something to
that plain white wall then I also have
drawers and storage all under my bed and
this carpet is actually from Target as
well keep my backpack just anywhere my
chair which I have a blanket over which
my blanket my big got me again so I
don't really know where it's from and

lights my camera bag everything back
there and now back to my bed for real so
these two pillows are also from Target
they're gold and white which is like the
theme in my room if you guys can't tell

is from home goods it was also in my
dorm room tour if you guys want to see

from Target I'm good like a broken
record everything is from Target guys
