what I'm doing on a day to day basis
then go subscribe to that this video I
am filming it kind of College decor hall
apartment hall just a decor hall I am
gonna be decorating my home office which
I'm excited that I'm old enough to have
like a home office so that's why I
purchased all of this stuff anyways I
cannot wait to show you guys everything
I got from society6 this is sponsored by
society6 so I would like to say a huge
shout out and thank you to them because
I'm obsessed with everything I got like
all the color scheme the theme I'm going
for you guys will be able to see it I'm
just I am very very happy with my
purchases they also were kind enough to
give it a 10% off coupon for all of my
viewers so if you're watching this and
like anything or want to start
decorating your apartment then you can
use my code it's just my name at Natalie
Barbu and you will get 10% off your
entire purchase so go and check them out
I'll link everything down below if you
guys do want to purchase anything but
I'm excited to show you guys I'm like
staring at it and smiling I'm just so
excited
if you guys don't know what society6 is
though it is a website where individual
artists and independent artists can put
their art on mugs notebooks backpacks
throw pillows blankets tapestries
anything like that and so when you're
buying from society6 you're actually
supporting and paying a local artist so
it's not like a look at Pottery Barn or
something where it's all like one
person's designing it and it's like
pottery barn's
stuff it's a bunch of independent
artists so that's what I like about it
just because everything is very unique
no matter what style you are they have
something for you because it's not just
like one designer if that makes sense so
the first thing I want to show you guys
is in the art so kind of like the prints
and stuff like that so the first print
that I got is there
cute print so it is just like polka-dots
it kind of it's polka dots but it's not
like perfect circle's it looks more like
a marker that was like stamped on
something kind of like a stamp I really
like the simplicity of it I like them
too black and white I was so I really
really liked this I thought it went with
the color scheme I wanted a lot of pinks
and blacks and whites and Silver's and
stuff like that so I just liked how
simple it was and it's small enough that
it's not like a giant polka dot poster
and I think I'm gonna frame it they have
framed pictures so I probably should
have gotten that instead but I think I
can just put this in a frame or I'll
make like a gallery wall with it the
next print that I got is gorgeous I'm
obsessed this light pink palm tree print
and this one is bigger than that other
one I wanted to get a variety of sizes
so it's nice that they had a lot of
options I reminded me of California
sunsets but even though I know it's not
a sunset in the background
you better believe California skies are
like pink during like 6 o'clock I'm
telling you I thought it was really
really pretty undermined me of my time
in LA and I just thought it was like a
cool color cuz again I wanted a lot of
it pinks in it the one thing I also like
about decorating an office versus like a
bedroom for me personally is that for my
bedroom I like very neutral tones as you
can see it's a lot of Browns a lot of
likes a lot of graves but for an office
I feel like it can be more fun it's oh I
just loved all of the colorful things
that society6 had and that was like I
was like you know what I'm just gonna go
for I'm gonna make it pink I'm gonna
make it black white like a lot more bold
because it's just an office it's not
like I need to spend like waking up in
the morning with like a hot pink poster
you know so I just thought it would be a
lot more fun the next thing I got is and
not a print but it is a metal frame or a
metal picture I guess I don't know how
to describe it it's on this metal board
and then you can hang it because of this
in the back but it's similar to the pink
one except it's all black and white it's
kind of like a sepia actually it's like
a little bit yellow tones but I love it
it's the palm-trees
it reminds me of California or Miami
again
which are some of my favorite places and
it's just very like eternal summertime
it reminds me of so I really really like
it I also love that it wasn't a paper
and that it was like actual like metal
on here so I thought that was super
super cool sorry you can see moving
light in the reflection hello
the next thing that I got is this super
cool clock so this clock I will be
hanging up and it's all black on the
inside with some gold numbers Roman
numerals all around it and then the
board or the the border of the clock is
actually I liked wood I thought it just
gave it so much more character and it
was way more unique like it wasn't just
silver or plain gold it had like this
light like wood and I thought that was
really really cute and it would match
with everything else that I got I loved
how it was all black on the inside I
thought that was so cool so I'm really
really pumped even though I feel like I
have one of these in my room at home and
I don't even have it set like it doesn't
actually tell time it's just a
decoration so I feel like oh probably
using this gesture decoration but it
could actually be set so if you guys
really want to tell time with a clock
the next thing that I got is I think my
favorite thing actually I'm gonna undo
it it's all rebels here so it's huge so
you guys will not be able to see all of
it in this as far as I'm sitting but you
guys get the gist of it it's a Bible
verse so this is the font that comes in
as you guys see it's really really large
I really wanted a giant one to kind of
take up a whole wall and the Bible verse
is first Corinthians 13 4 through 7 so
it is the one that says love does not
boast love it's not angry love is
patient love is kind in the bat Bible
verse I just love that Bible verse it is
one of my absolute favorites and it's
always such a good reminder to look at
because I don't know I just feel like
whenever you are in a relationship
whenever you are trying to show others
your love for them I just think it's
such a great reminder to tell you
exactly what love is so if you're ever
come
used with it that is literally the
greatest reminder and I loved that they
had that that's what's something that I
really loved about society6 is that
there is so much freedom for the artists
like they could put whatever they wanted
on the tapestries on their paintings
anything like that so if you want
something else but it's like funny and
whatever you can also find it there so I
love that tapestry and love that it was
black and white I just thought it was so
cool and I'm so used to having
tapestries that are like the one I have
behind me which is just like arrows or
like scenic scenery like mountains and
the lake and an ocean and I really love
that that was a quote instead I thought
it was really cool and the next thing
that I got is this throw blanket so I'm
gonna put this on the chair in my office
and I've loved the fun color of it again
like I wouldn't have his throats
tapestry gore this throw blankets in my
room necessarily because it's a little
bright but I just love how fun it is to
throw into my office so it has a bunch
of palm leaves and the background is
pink so again it matches the aesthetic
that I'm going for and you can get
anything onto a blanket which I thought
was amazing because these are so soft oh
my gosh it's actually so soft so the
next thing that I got is more like stuff
I can put on my desk like little random
trinkets I guess so I got this mug which
I'm obsessed with it says a badass babes
club it's a pink and it has hot pink
lettering and I just thought this was so
cute
and I wanted to and coffee out of this
or I want to put my like pencils in it I
don't know he might drink coffee out of
just because it's like yes I'm a badass
babe like I love this so much I love the
pink I love the lettering I love
everything about this mug thought this
was like the cutest thing I've ever seen
and then I got another mug and this one
is more for pencils I feel like so it is
a greenhouse so it's a greenhouse it's a
bunch of succulents and a bunch of
plants that has a little cat in it on
the drawing and I just thought this was
so so cute so I'm really really happy
with this purchase I also have an
unhealthy obsession with mugs like in
general like in our kitchen right now we
don't know where to put all of our mugs
because we have so
of them so that's just another problem
on its own and then another thing I have
in my desk it's this cute notebook I
really really love it it's just waves so
it's like an over a bird overhead
bird's-eye view of an ocean of a rough
ocean with a bunch of waves and I just
thought it was really cute it's just a
lined notebook so I'm gonna keep this on
my desk because I always like having
something to write on
this won't be a dedicated notebook but I
need something to just jot down any
notes or anything like that when I do
have with my home office and the next
thing that I got is this black and white
striped backpack I wanted this one to
keep in my office to have any folders in
or anything like that but also if I need
to work portably I want to have a cute
backpack that also looks good when it's
outlived by my desk because right now
the background that I have is very
practical but it's not the cutest so
like if I'm gonna get out in my room
it's just kind of like an eyesore
honestly so I just thought this is cute
cute backpack to have for when I'm going
home to go and it's a really really good
size it has multiple zippers multiple
compartments so I just really really
liked it and it was very simple but
again you can get any print you want on
anything that I that I'm showing you the
last two things I actually got as a gift
for my boyfriend so it's not really for
my apartment but it is for his and they
have a lot of guy and girl things so if
you were looking for a gift you can find
that too so the first thing that I got
was a bath mat for him because I know
that he's been wanting to like get like
better towels so I just decided to it's
like I'm gonna decorate your bathroom I
have this back mat and it's super super
cool mountains so it's mountains and I
just thought it was really really cool I
like how it's on a bath mat too you
normally don't see any like artwork on
backpacks just like plain grey or
something like that so I just thought
that was really nice
and it has like the anti slip bottom so
I just got him a bath towel with that
same design on it of the mountains and
these bath towels are actually really
really large I feel like they could be
beach towels but comes with two towels
and two hand towels so the hand towels
you guys will be able to see better but
it's just another Mountain photo and I
just thought it was so so cool and he's
such an outdoorsy person and
appreciates the mountains way more than
I do so I thought it's perfect
that is it for everything that society6
had sent me and that I had picked out
from them and I'm so excited to decorate
my office so if you guys want to see how
my office ends up looking like
