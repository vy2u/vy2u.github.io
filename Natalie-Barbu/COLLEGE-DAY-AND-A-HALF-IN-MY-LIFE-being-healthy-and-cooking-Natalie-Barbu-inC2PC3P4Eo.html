to the gym and this is the outfit that
I'm wearing for the gym really really
like it so I'm wearing this black tank
top and I tied it because it was really
really oversized from Target and it says
challenge accepted on it and like really
really thin layers I'm wearing it my
gray sports bra from pink these leggings
I got them as a gift and I'm not a
hundred percent sure the name of the
company so I'm just gonna insert it or
right here so if you guys want these you
can find them they're really really
comfortable they're like kind of like
camo ish print they're like pixelated a
camo I feel like that's the best way to
describe them but yeah really really
love it and then my gray Nike shoes
which I'm obsessed with my headphones
match of the outfits and not
intentionally obviously but I just think
that's funny I like looks so like
coordinated right now bringing the gray
the gray the black the black like it's
just like funny
I got back from the gym got back from
class showered ate lunch everything like
that but I just need myself an oat milk
latte and filled it to the brim so but
it is a dress an ugly day outside today
so I don't really want to leave my
apartment like at all so I am just here
editing a video editing the video that's
going up tomorrow and it's collab with
Jessica Howell so if you guys send me I
see this that will already be up I would
have uploaded it on Tuesday and you so
be sure to go and watch that one because
it's hilarious like I cannot wait to
edit it and yeah I'm just like so
excited to see how it turns out and I'm
really happy that it's finally going out
cuz we filmed it over a week ago
I'm just getting some work done sitting
at my desk normally I would go to a
coffee shop but since it's so ugly
outside I don't really want to so
honestly my Nespresso I think makes
better coffee than Starbucks and I have
oat milk which is my favorite dairy-free
milk so I'm content very pale but
I'm really excited I got some bruschetta
and I got some gnocchi and I got some
vegan pesto and the gnocchi does have
milk in it but it's fine because it's
not like it's most of the meal you know
so basically what I try to do is just
try to each plant base as possible but
if like 80 percent of the time is my
number about 80 percent so and then I
also got some broccoli broccolini and
what else have we got this Italian my
steak okay well yeah we got steak for
Colin but like I'm not going to eat that
what else did we get though that's
Italian
was that it I guess that's it and then
we just got a bunch of fruit and stuff
that I'll probably eat for dessert so
I'm so excited because I've been a
really really hungry all day so I'm
baking some bread
this little sake boiling a bunch of
water for broccolini and pasta gnocchi
here is the bruschetta from Trader Joe's
Chloe told me was really really good so
I really want to try it and then the
broccolini and my vegan kale cashew and
basil pesto with sun-dried tomatoes it's
a whole Italian feast that were having
to the nation's
oh yeah and Colin especially grated
Parmesan cheese our Italian dinner it
literally looks so good okay so I had
the vegan pesto I put some sun-dried
tomatoes on it sautéed broccolini with
garlic our bruschetta which was the
perfect crisp enos Collins grated cheese
his steak pasta broccolini milk now for
dessert the strawberry Kiwi calling
goats can I eat it or do Instagram it
first wait I do everyone next day and
I'm starting off the day going to the
gym I already had class today and it
actually was only 30 minutes long she
like led us out early so I'm gonna catch
a yoga class at 12 but it's currently
almost 10:30 and I want to have a coffee
before just like give me some fuel
because it's like a power workout or
power yoga class so I ordered this
online at thrive market and it looks
really good it's like coffee with
creamer already but it has flared in it
which I guess is like a superfood I've
got good reviews and oh I guess that's
his name that's why I guess Laird isn't
a thing it was like I don't know what
that is it's yeah it's just coffee
superfood creamer and I guess it's
supposed to be like it's good for like
giving you energy so more than normal
copy I guess I don't know I'm gonna try
it though looks and smells delicious and
I really like that it already has
creamer in it so I don't have to add any
milk also wanted to mention that it is
vegan I was actually concerned about
that but I just checked and it's vegan
so you look at my nail that is off to
yoga so I'm wearing this sports bra from
forever 21 and these leggings I like
working out in a sports bra when I go to
yoga just because I don't like like
drenching and
shirt and sweat so yeah this and then
I'm just gonna put a sweatshirt on cuz
I'm gonna run some errands afterwards
but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
