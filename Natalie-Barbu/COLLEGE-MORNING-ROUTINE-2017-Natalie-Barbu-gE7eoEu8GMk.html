today I am finally filming my College
morning routine video and this one is
actually a little more special because
you guys directly told me how you wanted
my morning routine video to bees if you
don't know what I'm talking about on
Instagram and Twitter I posted two polls
that said would you rather have this
morning routine vlog style or would you
rather have it like classic like
voiceover normal morning your teens that
I've kind of always done and most of you
guys surprisingly voted vlog styles so
in the comments below if you didn't have
a chance to vote let me know which type
of videos you guys like better of long
style videos or more like voiceover
better editing shots whatever or if you
like it to be more realistic I guess
because the one that's not blog style is
obviously a little less realistic
because it's kind of more like a movie
but let me know which one you guys like
if you didn't have a chance to vote and
to vote on the next video style or next
videos or whatever other polls I have
make sure to follow me on social media
and I don't want to have this video
intro be super super long so please be
sure to subscribe thumbs this video up
and let's get into my college morning it
is currently 654 it's dark outside and I
am awake good morning everybody so I
just woke up actually I just woke up
jumped out of bed once the bathroom wash
my face brush my teeth and put on
workout clothes so about ten months ago
I was in bed and now I'm awake and ready
so what I do in the mornings as I wake
up to super super early every single
morning because I am a crazy person and
I go directly to DJ with my roommates
and depending on who which I'm them go
normally it's just me and Ally and just
go to the gym like first thing in the
morning and I highly recommend it
to get your day started it feels so much
better you don't want to do it
afterwards cuz you're so tired and
everything so if you just push yourself
to wake up
then you will
when a person basically I've converted
all my roommates basically to that we
were just gonna head to the gym right
now right before our classes I always
start my morning off with this amino
energy pre-workout shake that's just
what I'm doing and I drink it on my way
to the gym if you're waking up this
early
I recommend a pre-workout shake one this
one doesn't make me like feel funny or
anything I really like it yeah and then
I'm just mixing
our school has lime bikes and I am about
to ride this to the gym I have not
ridden a bike in years so this should be
interesting
the gym and he rode our bikes through
campus which is super super embarrassing
for him is like I know the same once you
learn how to ride your bike you never
forget or whatever like it's like it's
like learning how to ride a bike or
something like that but like I literally
don't show bad at riding a bike so so
embarrassing there's like people going
to class and like I was like it's me and
like halfway walking my bike the whole
time but right now we are just gonna
breakfast breakfast I literally eat
every morning it is the best thing of my
day I'm not kidding so Ali and I are
seeing some avocado toast with one egg
each and I'll probably put some like
salsa on it or something like that but
definitely make sure to have a healthy
breakfast in the mornings in college
so for breakfast I am having a avvocato
toast on a whole-grain bread with some
salt pepper olive oil
spinach dye like cooked some spinach up
I do an egg and then I have some
mozzarella cheese on the side just
because it's going bad and I need to eat
it
I just got out of the shower I
definitely have to do that like we're
right when I get back from the gym
because I am so sweaty and gross and I
cannot go to class like that should I
get out the shower and while I'm getting
ready I like to light some candles in my
room so I have become obsessed with
these candles
all right so you see this giant mess
behind me yeah that all of that is about
to go because I am going to make my bed
because I do make my bed every single
morning I'm not just doing it for this
video I do it every cool morning so yeah
let's just start do it
ah Oh better now see that's something
take long just like my minutes on your
day to have a more productive day though
I definitely recommend to make your bed
every single morning it just puts me in
such a better mood it makes me feel like
I got it something done in the morning
so if that isn't even the first thing
that you do in the morning highly highly
recommend it I just think it starts your
day off so much better I always feel a
lot more tired and groggy when I walk in
and I see my bed unmade it's just kind
of like calling me so when it's made
it's like okay I can't go inside my bed
yeah you have to start doing work so I
know that's a very like mental thing but
it works and it makes your room just
look so much neater which I just think
puts me in a better mood in general now
what should I wear today and literally
look to at my closet and I'm always like
I have nothing to wear
all of these are summer clothes and it's
starting to actually get kind of chilly
outside so that is a big problem this
outfit right here basically consists of
what I wear on a daily basis it includes
cute little black booties white black
and denim so this is the most typical
Natalie outfits ever super super comfy I
know it might not look like it but it
really really is these shoes are amazing
and white denim because it's not too
cold outside yet so if I have a jacket
still good classic black t-shirt and
just one simple necklace so this is what
I will be wearing a to class today and I
like dressing up a little more for class
again it puts me in a better mood if you
dress well I think you feel good so
I sometimes do this this is not an
everyday thing but I like making a fresh
cup of coffee and while I'm kind of like
getting ready and doing my makeup and
cleaning my arraignment all that which I
didn't show you I normally watch
something on TV and they just took one
Tree Hill off Netflix which is very
uncool and like that was my favorite
show ever so I have the DVDs now so I'm
gonna watch that once I get those in the
mail
but I am then starting this is us and I
know it's starting back up on TV but I
haven't seen like any of that so so I am
on season 1 episode 1 and if you guys
watch that show let me know you guys
think of it or what your favorite show
is that I should start watching but
while I wait for my coffee and I'm
probably gonna like put the dishes away
and clean the kitchen that is what I
like doing yes we have like a real
coffee maker not a Keurig so it just
smells so good and I'm so excited and
these mugs are so cute oh my gosh
and definitely need to put like the
dishes away and just it's just a big
giant mess right now
and once I am done with doing everything
I have to do in the morning drinking my
coffee eating my breakfast working out I
just head out the door and go to class
so I'm headed to class right now and I
really enjoyed filming this for you guys
