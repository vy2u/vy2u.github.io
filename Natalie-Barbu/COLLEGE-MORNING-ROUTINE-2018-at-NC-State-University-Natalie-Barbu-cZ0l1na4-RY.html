routine and it's a collab with Danny
Jordan here on YouTube she's literally
gorgeous and so cute and also a college
youtuber so be sure to check out her
morning routines good morning you guys
it is Friday so I don't have class today
I wanted to film this video for you guys
this day because on a normal college day
basically don't have class anyways I
have one class in the morning each day
so I do the exact same thing all
throughout the week but it was just
easier to film on Friday so I'm just
gonna show you guys what my college
morning routine looks like and I'll take
you guys through my entire day I like
sleeping with the window open so I can
wake up with the Sun and I know a lot of
people think that's crazy
but I personally like it cuz I like
waking up early if I wake up at 10 a.m.
that's like heavily sleeping in for me
like even 9 a.m. is pretty sleeping in
for me so just woke up and I just caught
my phone for a little bit check
Instagram check Instagram check snapchat
check Twitter all that stuff like
watched a bunch of videos on Facebook
and I had boxer braids in yesterday so I
just slept with them because they're
just easy to like go work out in the
morning like it's still pretty much in
place so the first thing I do when I
wake up is either clean my room or
workout or I'll work out and then click
my room so that's what we're gonna do
today okay I gotta get myself out of bed
come on come on Natalie
so I'm gonna wash my face I don't really
know how this happens and I say that in
every video but my room is super clean
one day and then a huge giant mess the
next day so I gotta clean all that clean
all that clean all that and then we're
gonna go to the gym because I cannot
stand this so yeah that's just it's
gonna be done so much better oh my
goodness it only takes me about 10
minutes to clean my room but this this
is what I'm talking about
yes I like this it's time to go to the
gym and you guys love when I show you
guys my gym outfit of the days so today
I am wearing this green shirt I think
it's from Athleta super nice fit it
likes crunches so that it's very like
form-fitting and I really really like it
wearing a sports bra from pink and just
Pink's don't make sports bras because I
really liked them a lot and I kind of
want advice in another one still have my
hair in the braids I'm just gonna leave
it like that until I shower I have my
Capri Nikes from Nike obviously and
they're super cute these are the ones
that I got for Christmas around my
boyfriend's parents so thank you for
those they're awesome and then I'm
wearing my gray with green laces to
match my top Nike sneakers but the
sneakers I got forever ago so they
definitely don't sell them anymore but
yeah this is it I got my water bottle to
stay hydrated
all right so I just got back from the
gym and I had a good workout that was my
ears like crazy now I'm about to shower
but just got back from the gym I did
finished week 12 of Kayla which is like
the monumental moment so I'm really
happy and I'm happy with the results I
posted a picture last week so like at
the end of week 11 about the changes in
my body and I also have a fitness video
if you guys want to see that but
definitely go check that out on
Instagram let me know if you guys like
the Kayla program or what you guys do to
work out but I highly recommend working
out first thing in the morning or at
least in the morning to move your body a
little bit just get your muscles warm
too but just like a good start to your
day so I recommend it
and if you're watching this video and
in the morning get up do some jumping
jacks do some yoga five minutes that's
it just pause this video or better yet
watch this video while you're working
out and if you aren't one of those
people like me who watches youtube
videos while they're like on a treadmill
or the elliptical or while they're
working out comment that down below
after you've worked out um like yeah I
was watching you all's on the treadmill
because I definitely need that all the
time like I only want to youtube videos
when I'm doing cardio so I know I see
you guys don't worry I'm that little FBI
agent in your camera anyways I'm about
to go shower because I feel nasty and I
have been doing intermittent fasting so
I don't eat until twelve if you guys
want to learn more about that I can have
like scientific links down below don't
worry I'm still eating the same amount
of calories that I would during a normal
day it's just that I only eat from 12 to
8 this is like day four of doing it and
it's really not that hard because by the
time I like workout do everything I like
shower it's already like 11:30 so I
really don't have to wait long so if he
does want to learn more about that let
me know if you guys want me to do a
whole video on it and like my experience
on intermittent fasting let me know
because they just started doing it so I
see how it is but I still eat breakfast
cuz breakfast is my favorite meal of the
day so I'll just eat breakfast at 12 and
then I'll just have like a small lunch
and then like a dinner so yeah let's
let's just shower though
unloosen see I did not wash up my hair
because I had just washed it actually
last night so I didn't really feel like
washing it again because I had a
membrane so it got taken out but as you
can tell it's very very curly so I am
just going to curl light because I kind
of want some big poufy girls today but
this is just like a little flat at the
top so I'm gonna give it more texture by
curling my hair and this will also save
me time while I wait until it's level
o'clock to eat finally so it's 11:30
right now so I'm just gonna do this for
like 15 minutes and then go and prepare
my breakfast also I got an awful burn
face thanks to my curling iron so I'm
like terrified of it now but it's mine
because this curling iron is so thick
there's no way to make like cute tight
curls so I just said to put it up and
leave a bunch of curls and like poof in
the back and I think that looks cute and
liquid makeup on and stuff and just like
pulling at the ends of my hair I think
it's a cute up to
my breakfast I just made two eggs some
sauteed spinach and two toasts and I'm
about to put some butter on it so this
is it and of course a must is sriracha
sauce
I finish eating so now I am going to do
my makeup and if you guys can't tell
from how me and my other videos or vlogs
I literally wear this robe into like the
last possible second so that's why I'm
always in the road but I'm just gonna do
a simple makeup look because I'm not
filming anything today other than my
morning routine obviously but I'm not
doing any videos or anything like that
and so I might be taking pictures but
like I don't really need super heavy
makeup if I'm taking like an outfit
photo so I am just going to start with
some primer and then I'm just gonna use
some tinted moisturizer but let's just
speed this baby up
I just finished my makeup I did a super
simple look if you want me to do a
tutorial on this it's so easy but I have
just like to moisturize our bronzer
basically all my face makeup is on right
now and I did my eyebrows but I don't
have to do my eyes I just feel like it's
because I like rub my eyes a lot because
I have bad allergies for some reason
during this time of the year um so I
just like rubbing my eyes and I don't
want to wear makeup and honestly I don't
think I really need any eye makeup I try
to reserve my makeup if I'm like filming
or doing something different I like
going out or something like that so yeah
this is a look literally took me like
five minutes before I closed the routine
this is what I'm wearing it's this super
cute sweatshirt from Zara and then these
seventh-round mankind jeans and my
high-heeled black booties love the
all-black together I think it makes my
legs look super long but yeah I just
kept my hair up in a messy bun I just
got dressed and out and ready for my day
so I'm about to close the morning
routine here I really hope that you guys
