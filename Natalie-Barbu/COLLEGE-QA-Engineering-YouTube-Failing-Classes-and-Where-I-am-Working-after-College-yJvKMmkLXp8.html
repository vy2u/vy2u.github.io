and I'm so excited to be sitting back
down and filming I just feel like it's
been a while I don't know the last video
I put up was a vlog and I only had one
video out last week which went clean
really sad because they always post toys
a week this video is gonna be a video
where I'm just sitting and answering
your questions it is one of my favorite
videos to film I love filming QAS and
especially when they are college related
I just love it that's like my little
niche here on YouTube I feel like and a
lot of you guys found me through college
videos so comment down below how you
guys found my channel because I would
love to know I am sitting here with my
oat milk latte it just delicious you
guys hmm so grab a drink take a seat I
want to answer all your questions so if
you guys want to be part on my next Q&amp;amp;A
and want to get your questions answered
then be sure to follow me on my
Instagram because that is where you guys
will be able to keep up with me so I
highly recommend following me on there
and also I just post a lot of pictures
about my life a lot of fashion pictures
so I just recommend following me anyways
is that too much it's not too much to
say I tell someone to say if you guys
are new to my channel please be sure to
subscribe I post videos every Tuesdays
and Fridays and I just feel like you
guys will really love the content I put
out so be sure to subscribe and you guys
end up liking this video give it a
thumbs up because that helps me out a
ton and I also have a vlog channel so if
you guys just want to know what I'm
doing on my daily life be sure to
subscribe to that you guys have been
absolutely loving my blogs so I thank
you so much for that but I'm just gonna
answer the questions and I was really
surprised with how many questions I got
so thank you guys so much for asking me
you guys seriously means the world to me
how do you stay so motivated and
organized with such a difficult and
time-consuming major / career path so
for those of you guys who don't know I
am an engineering major I am an
industrial engineering major and I
graduate in like two to three weeks
which is mind-blowing this is the last
week of classes so I only have two
classes left of college for every my
main thing to staying motivated is I
would always write things down
and all things just so I knew when I had
to do everything but my way of saying
motivated to do my work and not just
like skip a homework or like not study
for a test was honestly because I would
like punish myself if I didn't do well I
was never one of those people in high
school that or even in middle school
that my parents had to be like so what
are your grades like they never really
were like on top of my grades because
they knew that I wanted to do well so
like it wouldn't help to like ground me
if I got a bad grade because they know I
was probably punishing myself more I
hate that feeling of showing up to a
test and not like knowing a whole
subject also had a lot of study groups
and friends in my classes so that helped
motivate me because when they were
studying I would go study with them but
I would just be very very organized and
structured and that's a lot a lot of
self-discipline being in a hard major
you really can't just slack off and do
things the last minute so for me it was
just scheduling things out and self
motivating myself because I know that if
I didn't study for that test I literally
would fail so I had to like it was one
of those things where it's kind of like
I had no choice if that makes sense
another question that I got a lot was
what do I plan on doing after college so
I'm excited to answer this on here I've
talked about it before but I don't
really know video specifically and I
feel like it's just all over the place
so unless you like watch so many of my
videos you probably don't know so what I
am doing after college is I graduate on
May 12th is my graduation a week after
my graduation I'm actually moving out to
LA for the summer so I will be there
from May to August I'm only gonna be
there first summer and mainly that is to
focus on YouTube to build connections to
do a lot of collabs and I figured it was
my last summer to kind of just move to a
new place I never studied abroad I never
lived in like a different city and so I
was just like why not like this is my
last summer I can get some good out of
it because I'll be networking and my
managers out in LA and like I'll be able
to connect more with brands and other
youtubers so I just wanted to do that
for my last like final summer I guess
and so I'm so excited to be doing that
if you guys are from align have any tips
for me please comment down below but I
am like so excited and let me know who
you guys want me to collab with because
I'm gonna be doing a lot of collabs
while I'm out there so let them know
tweet them DM them whatever and I really
would I just like meet a bunch of people
I am coming back to Charlotte in North
Carolina which is where I'm from and I
have like a special surprise for you
guys that I won't be announcing until
July so I'm not gonna say anything but
I'm working on a huge project and it
doesn't have to do with YouTube it has
to do with like my own like personal
goals so I personally am working on a
huge huge project that I will announce
in about July so I'll be doing that in
Charlotte and then I also have a job
lined up after college so I'm starting
my job with a consulting company and
it's one of the big consulting companies
and I'm just so excited I have always
wanted to do like a business field I
know I'm in engineering but that's why I
chose Industrial Engineering because I
wanted to solve problems in a more
business standpoint versus like
manufacturing so I got a job with a
really really great consulting company
you guys definitely have heard of it if
you guys work in like engineering
related fields but yeah I got that job I
think in like September or October of
last semester so it was really like a
big load off my chest like knowing that
I had something after graduation and
that will be based in Charlotte North
Carolina and yes I will 1,000,000% still
be doing YouTube videos so I don't think
that's gonna really be affected I might
have to film more on weekends and like
maybe it'll go down to one video a week
with my blog channel and my main channel
will still be its normal self so I'm
excited to kind of transition into
adulthood too and take you guys along on
that journey after you graduate while
you and your boyfriend be doing
long-distance or you pass or are you
planning on staying near each other if
possible love you love you too and so my
boyfriend actually got a job with a
computer company cuz he's in computer
science with some like really really big
computer company software company in
Raleigh North Carolina so he will be in
Raleigh and I will be in Charlotte and
we're gonna try it as hard as possible
to make it work we don't have any plans
on like separating or anything so we'll
be doing long-distance and I really
don't know where either of us will be in
a year from now like everything is so up
in the air even though we do have jobs
like we could relocate it's just so up
in the air
so you'll be in Raleigh and I'll be in
Charlotte which is only three hours
apart so it's not too bad advice on
choosing a major and finding something
you love to do so I actually have a
whole series on my youtube channel
called how to choose your major and so
many of you guys love those videos and I
really want to bring them back so
comment down below if you guys want to
see more of those and what majors I
should do but I will link a playlist for
that all down below because like I have
done so many majors with like I
interview my friends of different majors
and they just explained what it is so if
you guys want more of those thumbs this
video up so I can see that and basically
my best advice is to figure out where
you want to work like what field do you
want to work it doesn't need to be a
specific specific job but just a general
field that you want to where work in
research a lot of majors and see what
they can do because a lot of the majors
overlap with what jobs you can get hired
with and also remember that just because
you have one certain major doesn't
necessarily mean that you need to work
in that field forever for me engineering
is not something that I was like oh my
gosh it's my dream to become an engineer
like it was never like that but I knew
the skills that I would possess with an
engineering degree and how I would be
better at problem solving how I would
become smarter hopefully people would
see me and say that see that I'm in
engineering and I feel like that is a
plus to a lot of companies and people
that are hiring and it's an advantage
and just all like the how I'm like
better at time management now than ever
before how I know how to like discipline
myself and study for some subject that
I'm not really familiar with things like
that like all those skills are skills
that I wanted to have in the future even
though it's not like wow I love
engineering whew like it's my favorite
it's like passion it's not but I knew
that all of those things that I would
gain would take me on to what I want to
do when I was older and yeah so you also
have to think of it like that mainly
just like try to figure out what you
want to work in what field what type of
work you want to do and from there on
figure out which major is quarterly the
best with that do you want to go to grad
school no I really don't I
I'm saying this is like my last call
like my last week of classes forever
because I really don't see myself going
to grad school I will never say never
like any if I did go to grad school and
most likely would get my MBA but in my
foreseeable future I don't see myself
going to grad school a random question
was what was kami like what did you guys
talk about if you guys don't know the
person that I get it commented the most
ever is that I look like Camilla Mendez
which is Veronica on Riverdale which I
take that as a huge compliment because I
think she's gorgeous but that is what I
get the most comments on her and violin
Hansa viola jente I don't know how to
say her last name
she's like an Instagram like minor
YouTube person so I give the comments
most about those two and I recently met
kami Mendes at Coachella we were at the
same after-party and she I like had to
go up to her there was no way I wasn't
gonna go up to her so I don't normally
like approach people but I like wet and
I'm like are you Camila Mendes she was
like yeah she was super super sweet I
told her I do YouTube videos I told her
I loved Riverdale and I told her that I
did a makeup tutorial on Veronica and
she was like oh my god thank you so much
like yeah I could definitely see that we
look alive like thank you like you're so
sweet and I was like do you mind if we
take a picture and she was like oh yeah
for sure
she took the picture like a selfie and
my friend who was with me Julie she was
like can I get in the picture like I
love Riverdale too and she was like yeah
of course and then took the picture
again so we have two selfies with Camila
Mendes and she was just the sweetest
person ever and I'm so happy that I got
to meet her what is your advice to all
the teenagers who don't have selfic self
esteem so in high school growing up if
you guys want to watch my high school
experience video I talked a lot about
how insecure I was in high school and I
feel like I have grown so much and just
like blossomed if you like in college
and I have become so much more confident
and I don't really know exactly if
there's like one thing to do to like
have you have self esteem I think a lot
of it comes with a h-honestly
because in when you're 15 16 I feel like
you're trying so hard to fit in but if I
could tell my younger self anything to
help me become more confident and less
insecure it would just be who the heck
here's what these people think about you
like who are they like why are you
letting yourself be unhappy for these
people like their peak is probably high
school honestly and also not even about
that but like why are you insecure like
you are so freaking beautiful you're so
loved you were made by God and He loves
you so freaking much like how can you be
insecure about that like what do you
have you know like that just putting
that into perspective like you know what
no I am here on this earth I'm here for
a reason I was made by the creator of
the universe which we all were so you
just tell yourself that hopefully you
can become my guests like realize
yourself worth more and just realize
that you are so so low it's like even if
you feel like you don't have a lot of
friends or you feel like you have a bad
family home life there is someone out
there that loves you God loves you
beyond words and yeah just realize that
and realize that you are here on this
planet
for a purpose you have a purpose in life
and you are here for a reason and when
you filled out about yourself that is
normal everyone feels down about
themselves but just realize that there's
no good that comes out of that so it's
kind of like you're putting yourself in
misery like just try thinking about all
the positive things in your life and all
of like the great things and also just
start thinking like who cares what other
people think like really who cares you
know that was always my biggest
insecurity it's caring what other people
thought about me or comparing myself to
others and yeah you just gotta get rid
of that and force yourself to get rid of
that because it's not something that
comes with just one thought you need to
constantly repeat it to yourself until
you believe it so that's just I guess my
biggest advice um I definitely do think
it comes with time though because as you
get older I feel like you just become
more confident of a person I don't know
I that's what happened to me but also
just repeating those like loving things
to yourself really really helps someone
asked me if I had any internships in
college and yes I did after my sophomore
year so the summer going into my junior
year of college I had an internship with
Ralph Lauren and I had it with their
operations development team so it
actually was with other engineering
people so like my manager was
that's real engineer the other intern I
had was an industrial engineer we were
on the warehouse floor of like their
e-commerce so if any time you've ordered
anything from Ralph Lauren comm or Club
Monaco comm because they're owned by the
same company I worked in the place that
packaged and sent it out so it was just
their distribution center or that's
where I worked and that's where I
interned so I did have that I learned a
lot from it I thought it was a great
experience but I also realized what I
didn't didn't wanted to like I never
want to work on a warehouse floor again
someone asked me if I ever failed a
class and if I did how to not lose
motivation in my very first engineering
video I talked about how C's get degrees
and I got a lot of hate on that because
they were like oh well if you get like
that's not really true blah blah first
of all it is true you still graduate if
you know you get C's like just throwing
that out there
what I meant by it is not getting
straight C's on your like every single
one of your classes but if you get to
see every now and then
don't lose it like it's fine you got a C
so what people are still gonna hire you
maybe they're the competition is more
fierce and you might not get a dream job
because someone competing with you also
has straight A's but like there's so
much more to the hiring process than
just grades it's people skills because
there are some people that are these
smartest people I've ever met and they
literally cannot work face to face with
someone so that that's why they do
interviews there's extracurriculars you
have to have like a big rounded picture
how well you do in the interview like
for mine I have to do a case study
interview so how well you do in that how
you're problem-solving thinking is that
doesn't all show by just getting
straight A's that Congrats leave a 4.0
but what else you have you know I have
gotten I've never failed a class like
I've never had like an F on my like I've
never like actually fail get into the
industrial engineering program here at
NC State you have to get a C in physics
who like apply for it or else you have
to retake physics and with physics the
first physics class I hated it I got a
c-minus so I had to retake the class so
I technically didn't fail but I didn't
have to retake it and I really really
sucked just because I already hated that
class so much and I was like why do I
have to retake it
like I studied so hard and I still just
like could not get the cease so that
really sucked but you just do it like
honestly like what good is gonna come
out of you complaining about it you know
and I knew that I was capable of doing
fine
like I knew that what Tyree took it I
would do better and I ended up getting
like an a-minus when I retook it so
really it's just self motivating
yourself realizing one bad grade one
failed class is not going to like it's
not you're not stupid
you're not dumb everybody goes through
that let all subjects come naturally to
people and you got to understand that
someone comes in message to the haters
which is really funny cuz in all my
other engineering videos I swear girls
get such a bad rap of being like catty
and mean and nasty but I am telling you
guys you girls that comment on my videos
are the sweetest people like 99.9% of
the time like I've maybe have like very
very very very very very few hate
comments from girls like I honestly
don't even like think I've had like
really maybe I can count on one hand out
of all my years of YouTube and then as
soon as I post an engineering video it's
just um so many comments from men that
are so mean and I'm message to the
haters like I really don't care any
about you guys like congrats for being
able to type and hit submit and feeling
better about yourself I hope that you
guys have a great day and then the last
question that I'm going to answer is
what is my favorite College memory and I
just want to answer this because I'm
feeling really sentimental right now I
don't have one specific favorite College
memory but as a whole I really really
loved tailgating NC State has let such
great tailgating for football games it's
just so much fun go pack just being able
to have roommates and like hanging out
with people all the time and being on
your own and really learning so much
about yourself like I don't who is 18
year old me I don't know her it's just
so crazy that four years have gone by
I'm literally about to cry why by about
to cry oh my gosh
four years have gone by and I'm
graduating it's so little time and I
thank I was supposed to get emotional
about this comes like so ready to
graduate but now that it's happening I'm
just like wow I have to say goodbye to
all of this we have to say goodbye to
like the college experience the college
life I guess and go on to the real world
but I know that it'll still be fun and
I'm excited for my big project and I'm
just so happy that I have you guys cuz
if I didn't I really don't know what I
would do so I just wanna thank you guys
from the bottom of my heart for being
with me throughout this entire
experience and if even if this is your
first video like I just thank you guys
so much for supporting me and just like
really encouraging me a lot of time
because you're like how do you stay
motivated and honestly stay motivated
because I read your comments and I read
your DMS so thank you guys so so much
for being with me on this journey it's
not over yet so I don't know why I'm
like crying but yeah I have this video
super long but I hope that you guys
liked it bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
