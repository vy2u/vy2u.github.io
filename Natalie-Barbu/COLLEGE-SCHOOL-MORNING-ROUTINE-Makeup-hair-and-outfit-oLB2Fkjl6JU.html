filming a school morning routine and I
am a junior in college for those of you

in college I know I look super young but
I'm 20 years old in case anyone was
wondering this is my school morning your
teen and I'm just kind of showing you
guys and taking you step by step on
basically what I do in the morning
because I know these videos are so
popular and if you guys haven't noticed
I am uploading on a Wednesday which is
not my normal upload date I normally
upload Tuesdays and Fridays but this
video is exciting because it is a collab
with one of my really good friends Kyla
we already did a previous collab which
was a college like tips and like the
real deal like what college is really
like and we met at YouTube Nextup so I
went to YouTube Nextup this summer like
you can watch a video on that too of all
those link down below but yeah we met

there so I'm so so excited if you guys

because I would love to know if I have

that
and hi welcome I think said if you're
not subscribed please subscribe to my
channel but I'm just gonna walk you guys
through my school morning routine and
yeah that's that's just what we're gonna
do well first things first of what I do
in the morning is I wake up to my alarm
clock so shocker I don't know I feel
like these morning routine videos it's
like what else do you do like you
obviously wake up to your alarm clock
but yeah I wake up to my alarm clock
typically like an hour before class
that's basically all it takes for me to
get ready sometimes 45 minutes I'm not
that big of like laying in bed for a few
minutes like I get up pretty quickly so
I get up and then I just go to the
bathroom and do my bathroom things I
don't feel the need to show you guys
because I have other morning routines
where I show you and honestly all I do
is wash my face brush my teeth and go to
the bathroom and then I sit down and I
do my makeup so firm eye makeup this is
very a quick basic back to school make
look so I just put on some BB cream that
put concealer on my face I've been
breaking out a lot lately actually and
so I've been definitely needing some
concealer to cover up any blemishes that
I have and then I just put some under
eye concealer all that good stuff and I
bronzed a little bit like I put I do
contour but not heavy contouring as if
I'm going on like a night out so I just
take a big contour brush put it kind of
on my cheekbones and then I take a
highlighter which is Anastasio glow kit
which is literally the best thing in the
world I take that and put that on my the
high points of my cheekbones to make me
extra glistening and then I take the
purple color and I put that again like
where I contour just to kind of make it
more like stand out put Mac Paint Pot on
there it's the purple color so it gives
me a little bit of color
I line my eyes with Kat Von D liquid
eyeliner and then I put mascara on and I
fill in my eyebrows it is so quick it
takes me 10 minutes to do my makeup in
the morning I have it down to a science
I just like know exactly what I'm gonna
do how I'm gonna do it and then my go-to
hairstyle so normally when I wake up
with just kind of like naughty hair and
like tangled hair and it doesn't look
good naturally on its own I this is my
go-to hairstyle this is like screams me
everyone knows me like everyone I feel
like this is just like a hairstyle I
wear all the time all I do is put all my
hair up kind of make it a little more
messy so I don't flatten it out at the
top or anything just like a messy
ponytail put it pretty high up tighten
it whatever and then I take a piece of
hair and I wrap it around the base of my
ponytail so around the scrunchie or the
elastic so that you don't see it and I
bobby pin it it makes it look so much
better so much more like cute and like
you actually took more than two seconds
on it when really you did it and then
because your hair is messy from the
night before it actually looks good it
looks like a messy ponytail and it takes
zero time so that is definitely my go-to
hairstyle after that I get dressed slay
this is also another me outfit I don't
try that hard to for class I don't know
I just in college even though I love
fashion
I just can't dress up that much for
class I just I just can't you guys will
realize if you guys aren't in college
that no one dresses up for class and
it's just really hard to get yourself to
put a cute outfit on when you are so
tired from studying all night so
basically what I do my go-to outfit is
big t-shirt that I got from Goodwill I
love love love goodwill t-shirts you can
find the best things there and they're
so so cheap I am wearing my brandy
melville like velvet shorts they're so
so so comfortable I think they're really
cute and I just kind of like this look
and then to make it look a little bit
more fancy I actually put a choker on
and this is another thing that like the
outfit I'm showing you guys right now is
the kundra sent Natalie outfit like just
screams like Natalie like this is what I
always wear it's like a big t-shirt and
a choker the choker just makes you look
more presentable just kind of like the
hair wrapped around the ponytail makes
you look more presentable I go to the
kitchen and I make it my favorite
breakfast so normally for breakfast I
always have eggs so it's kind of like my
go-to thing so I make eggs and a few
guys can't tell I'm really bad at
flipping them but I just like try my
hardest I don't I like the yolk to be
runny but not like too too runny so
that's why it's like I I try to flip it
and like it just sometimes doesn't work
and yeah you guys see it and then I take
two tortillas I like corn tortillas and
I heat them up in the microwave for
about 20 seconds 10 seconds around there
in a paper towel and then I actually
made this like burrito bowl thing
yesterday so it has like rice quinoa
peppers onions garlic and beans and I
made that and I just served it chilled
this morning kind of like a Pueblo
rancheros type feel and then I also put
some salsa on it and I always get fresh
salsa I never get like the canned salsa
I just really don't like that and I made
myself basically like a la vez rancheros
meal and it was so so so so so good if
you guys want me to make a college
cooking video which a lot of you guys
have suggested that I do let me know
again tell me kind of like what things
you want to see what videos you want to
see after I'm done eating breakfast I
just head out the door and that's
basically my school morning routine and
I head to class I feel like morning
routines it's so hard to not be
repetitive and I've done so many morning
routines so I wanted to make this one
different by just like sitting down and
talking to you guys so I hope that you
guys enjoyed it let me know if you did
if you like style or not I want to make
it like short and sweet to the point um
I don't need to show you guys like me
brushing my teeth and stuff like that
but if you guys liked it please give it
a thumbs up and also please subscribe to

also did a college morning routine and
