you talking female college and this is a
video that is kind of going to be
convinced in one video though I'm just
going to be talking about a lot of
things in this video and I can make
separate videos for all the things I'm
talking about and go more into detail
with them but for now I'm kind of
breaking it up into different topics and
just kind of showing you guys like what
might be just kind of my overall first
semester college experience
clearly I am NOT a college guru and I
don't know everything about college but
I'm just going to share with you what I
learned in my first semester of college
well first thing starts with adjusting I
adjusted very well I did not have a
trouble adjusting at all I transitioned
really easily it wasn't a big deal like
transitioning at all so transitioning
for me was not hard at all I did not get
married am homesick and I know my
family's probably watching this right
now I'm probably thinking how oh my gosh
Shay I'm gonna come home no that's not
it but I was just very fine the first
semester I enjoyed being in college and
I didn't wanna go home because I was so
new to me and I kind of just enjoyed
being here and being on my own and being
independent I'm a very independent
person so I just kind of enjoyed that
and I I know I I adjusted very fine per
semester I was not home sick at all I
went home like twice
not including breaks on to random
weekends and it was fine it's three
hours away I have a car so I could kind
of go home whenever I need to which I
think that's also why I was fine
adjusting cuz I knew I could go home and
I wanted to but yeah I think I think I
would have gotten more homesick if I was
more far away but I wasn't and my
parents who come visit me some random
weekends so it wasn't like I never saw
them so yeah I just didn't perfectly
fine so that was my whole adjusting
thing but second semester which is this
semester I kind of feel more homesick
now I don't know maybe it's the cold
weather and that makes me feel homesick
or something it's all gloomy outside but
yeah it's like semester I'm definitely a
lot more homesick I think maybe after
the sonics I'm gonna call
first semester my mom you kind of
realized like high school kind of was a
lot easier so much more relaxed like
that whatever so you kind of miss home
at least for me if you guys have had
that experience comment down below and
let me know for maintaining your
schoolwork this is going to be the
second part of this video so for
maintaining school work for me births
Webster I thought it was pretty easy
I write basically syllabus week you get
all the due dates for everything that
you're going to be working on which is
really nice which it didn't really
happen in high school um so you get due
dates for everything and you have to
keep track of it but I just bought an
agenda and I thought it was really easy
to keep track of it so I got my agenda
from Target it's just a small red one um
and I just wrote all my due dates there
and on the calendar I wrote all my due
dates just so I know what's coming up
what my plans were everything like that
so I thought it was very easy to keep up
with it um I would do everything before
the weekends because unlike high school
I wanted to get everything done before
the weekends I basically don't do
homework on weekends I reserved that
Strickland for the week so like slave
away my home my schoolwork during the
week and during the weekends able to be
relaxing and I really like the way I
schedule that because it's just really
nice not having to focus on school
during school and obviously I might
leave like one homework assignment
during the weekend but for the most part
I try doing everything during the week
before mine begins because my weekends I
like relaxing I don't really want to
think about school because I just had a
rough week so yeah that is basically
what I do and I'm an engineering major
so I have a lot of homework I take a lot
of kind of hard classes compared to
other people I'm not saying like oh I'm
so smart I've so many hard classes no
I'm just saying compared to some people
I have harder classes so it might be a
little bit more difficult for
engineering majors to try to maintain
this will work but I think I came into
college knowing that so that's why I was
like no shirt on myself for a semester
and now second semester I've slacked off
but I mean I'm still annoyed by second
semester but I think I realized like I'm
so strict on myself per semester so
that's why I kind of just like slacked
off the semester but whatever I'm
getting there but yeah it's okay
also if you kind of fall behind
obviously try to keep up but everyone's
kind of going through the same thing
that you are just remember that and I
failed basically all of my first tests
and like basically every class and I
ended up with a 5 GPA a fine average
like you can redeem your low test scores
obviously don't get a low test score in
the second time coming around but it's
fine if you fail your first test
everyone's been there everyone does that
no one is going to look at your first
semester first test grade to be like
about you feel that you're a failure
life so don't think of it that way
everyone fails and everyone succeeds so
I guess if you feel doesn't mean that
you won't succeed that's basically what
I'm trying to say but my classes are
pretty hard but I enjoy calculus so that
kind of relieves a lot of pressure
because calculus is one of the harder
classes so it's good that I enjoy it
science on the other hand like chemistry
and physics I don't really like so that
kind of sucks but um yeah I'm really
like I enjoy calculus it's just
different than high school the
schoolwork is a lot different than high
school your teachers expect more of you
but if you go into college knowing that
I think that you'll be fine just know
that you have to be on top of things and
don't let things pile up until the last
second because then you won't finish
them and then that will suck and
teachers don't accept late work at all
in high school or in college if you have
a professor that does that you are lucky
because none of my professors accepted
anything like like at all um and if you
guys want me to do a separate video just
some kind of college courses and the
cool courses I'm taking kind of just
going down a list of like descriptions
of that kind of when I think of them let
me know cuz I really do enjoy making
these videos for you guys a second part
or third part college or third section
of this video is kind of gonna be
roommates and friends I tell my
roommates on Facebook I definitely
recommend doing that because it makes it
allows you to meet new people like not
just people from your high school
my roommates around Pennsylvania and I
live in North Carroll
so it's very I met so many new people I
knew a lot of people from high school
coming here my name on a room with any
of them especially since most of them
were guys so I couldn't even read with
them if I wanted to but I wanted to meet
new people and I'm not saying don't keep
your high school friends because I still
hang out with them and definitely make
new friends college you're kind of here
to make new friends and meet new people
and just put yourself in a new
environment
so my adore the way it works if you want
to see a dorm room tour I'll link that
down below it's two rooms and one
bathroom so there's four people sharing
one bathroom so all of us have did not
meet until move-in day we all kind of
knew each other from Facebook but we did
not visibly meet in person until move-in
day so that was kind of fun and it was
kind of awkward at first because we
didn't know each other but it worked out
great and then we're like best friends
so you know it does work out in the end
and that is kind of what I recommend I
know a lot of people though who hate
their roommate and that is really
unfortunate for them um so make sure
that you guys talk about winning if you
got smart meeting someone on Facebook or
even if you're not even if it's just
someone from high school make sure you
talk about like drinking drugs breaking
voice in the room how clean you want
your room to be bathroom rules grim
rules like don't be like too strict on
them obviously but you guys need to make
sure that you guys kind of match and
agree on those things because you're
living together for a whole year and I'm
telling you some of the things they do
will annoy you even if you love them and
some of you know just like it's hard
living with another person if you're not
used to that so sorry I kind of had to
restart my camera but anyways yeah back
to roommates definitely make sure you go
over at ground rules of what you want in
a roommate because just address
everything because that's so important
you're going to be living with this
person for a whole year so you're gonna
want to get along with them because it's
so awkward if you don't if you walk in
your room and you don't talk to your
roommate like
I can't imagine walking in my room and
like hating my roommate like that what's
up
so yeah you definitely ought to make
sure that you guys clicked and you guys
match up on a lot of things like that
you agreement so yeah and also college I
kind of came into college thinking I was
going to make so many new friends and
like I was gonna have like 50 friends
coming on a band like lifelong like soul
mates or whatever and that is not the
case um at least for me maybe for some
of you guys it was but it's very awkward
at first like no one knows each other
and everyone's just cool and walking
around like oh my gosh who are you like
I don't know anyone so awkward and trust
me everyone's feeling that way so don't
be afraid if you think that you're the
only one feeling that way because you're
not and everyone is and as the gears go
on you and as the year goes on you will
meet so many people but you might have
any friends and so many people so my
friend consists of my sweet and maybe a
couple other girls and a couple other
parents but really I have not met that
many friends
I also have a lot I'm a very reserved
person and shy I like being in bed by
nine o'clock I don't like going out that
much so that also is kind of a factor
for me like my suitemates they love
going out they love meeting new people
so they like have met so many people and
I on the other hand that as many people
as them um which I really provide that
much might need to be surrounded by
friends all the time personally you guys
are gonna think I'm like such a loner in
this video but I really do like like
being to myself a lot so um yeah so I
thought I was gonna make a lot of
friends in college and I didn't make as
many as like right and that's also the
reason I rushed just so I rush and I
will do a whole separate video on Russia
if you guys are on so let me know if you
guys what we do
but I thought it's gonna make so many
friends from that and a fight event
I did make a lot of friends in my
sorority but it's not like I'm like so
tight with them and we do everything
together but I do like them and I do
enjoy doing a sorority I'm in SATA town
outside you skipper wondering he doesn't
see the letters right there oh yeah so
that also helps and if you are a
sorority girl then sororities will never
help you I hated sororities in school
and I never wanted to do one and I
thought they were really stupid and then
they went to college everyone was doing
it I was like okay I'm gonna do it and I
did enjoy it so my idea of sororities in
high school really changed my gums
cartilage but still I am still
personally not like oh my gosh I love my
sorority so much like these are my life
log sisters like I think that's cool if
you're like that I personally am NOT so
that's also why I think I kind of built
a wall of myself and didn't let me
become friends with everybody because I
wasn't really like that and I'm not like
it's a bad thing I'm just saying me
personally that's I think why I don't
have as many friends or because many
people and I sound like such a loner and
I sound so sad this video I brought
us.you I'm totally fine I love college I
did meet a lot of new people I'm just
telling you my personal experience I
mean this is totally different for a lot
of people like I'm sure if you ask my
roommates their college experience it
would be a little different but I'm not
saying that it's a bad thing that I
haven't met so many people
I'm just saying that it's just straight
up and
here like that because I think the idea
of college is you're gonna come here and
you're gonna meet with 50,000 people and
you're gonna become friends with
everyone and that's not always the case
like for me so yeah um next part of this
video is going to be the social part of
the video which I know a lot of you guys
probably wanted to know from the very
GetGo of this yap parties so in the
beginning of the school year I went to a
couple frat parties and I personally
don't drink but a lot of people do like
everyone in college well not everyone in
college does but a lot of people do and
I don't and that's totally fine trust me
no one thinks you're weird if you don't
like no one has been like you're not
drinking like no what does that that's
just in movies so yeah I went out with
like the first couple nights because I
keep moved in before classes started and
rap parties aren't huge people in every
school house like so different from high
school like literally you're in a house
full of people that you don't know and
you're just like oh my gosh Carly look
like this is what colleges and it gets
old after a while after about like maybe
like three to five parties I was already
like okay party
been there done that and I still go out
on the weekends sometimes not every
weekend like day every couple weekends
every other weekend I'm really no but I
don't go out there in the week it's like
I said I do my homework during the week
but a lot of people go out during the
week and a lot go out on the weekends
and I kind of pick and choose what I'm
gonna go out sometimes I'm feeling tired
yeah so sometimes I'm just really tired
and I don't feel like going out and
there's nothing wrong with that I like
kind of being in bed early and I as up
continue to say this I literally sound
like the biggest grandma but whatever so
yeah that's kind of my life in college
um also if I get I go to
eight which is in Raleigh and I know
there's travel on the UNC Chapel Hill so
you can see which probably other people
not in North Carolina know as University
of North Carolina just that's it so you
would see in Duke are right next to me
they're about 30 minutes away each and I
have a ton of friends of travel field so
I go there on the weekends sometimes
just to kind of hang out with them so
that's a lot of fun because I kind of
keep all my high school friends because
they all up there so that's really cool
um it's really nice having friends so
close to you that can kind of if you
want to like see high school friends you
can if you don't then you don't have to
so I think that's really nice but yeah
so that's also a good thing and I get to
kind of experience both college
atmospheres of travel hills and in
states which NC State's is a little bit
better but that's my opinion
um but yes so that's kind of a where I
was going with the social part frat
parties are not different than high
school parties like trust me you're
going to be in a room with people that
you don't know that are housed shoving
you and it is fun and I'm not gonna lie
some people love frat parties and I do
take they're fun I don't think I could
do that more often but they are fun a
lot of people bit of bars if you're not
21 then you can't really get in but we
have a bar that's for 18 years and up
it's just you can't drink if you're 18
obviously I thought it's that one
sometimes and that one's like fun
whatever people are just like hanging
out talking I think I like that better
than the party is personally but I still
don't really go to that that much either
I I sound like such a girl ah but
whatever uh-huh yeah so I like again
like I said I like staying in and if
this is a sir it's just been a really
cold outside so I have not wanted to go
outside yeah it's just too cool for me
but I think they covered basically all
of college experience in one video and I
want to do videos on like parties and
general Russian general schoolwork in
general classes in general mic
engineering classes in general so let me
know if you guys want to see those or
just like college style videos or
something like that so let me know in
the comments below and I'm about to do a
Q&amp;amp;A video so I'm so excited about that
