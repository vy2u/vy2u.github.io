lot a lot of fun interesting things that
could be happening this year and
triple-a is finally here yes thank you
hey everyone it is Natalie and today I
am filming a week in my life so I'm
doing another college we get my life and
I do have a vlog channel for those of
you guys that don't know but I like
doing these week videos on my main
channel because you guys loved my first
week in my life like it got such a
positive response so I wanted to film
another one for you guys so I just got
ready for my first day or my last first
day of class it's crazy on the second
semester senior but it's really really
weird and I kind of wanted to look a
little bit presentable so I already
worked out this morning and I showered I
got ready and I made some overnight oats
last night which I am eating in this yo
and they're so good my blueberries in it
delicious but I only have one class
today which is nice and then I'm gonna
head to the mall to return some stuff
and just run some random errands and
yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be a good
video I'm really excited for this week
in my life I want to do more of these if
you guys like them let me know but I
just want to come here and film a little
intro and right now I am at 99 thousand
eight hundred and I think 30 subscribers
so I think by the time this video goes
up most likely you will have hit 100
thousand and that's insane so hopefully
it happens this week so I can film a
reaction but yeah I'm excited it's a
little later and I just finished my
first class and only class of the day
and I'm with Ali right now and we are at
the mall so I had to return a pair of
shoes that I got and there's something
in my
I'd return a pair of shoes that I had
bought and they didn't have my size so I
got my Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer
I used to use that when I was in like
middle school and liked it and then
stopped so now I'm bringing it back
because I don't want to wear a heavy
foundation every single day which is
what I do when I wear makeup so I'm
excited too but I like the tinted
moisturizer again and then I also got
the Marc Jacobs do highlighter drops so
I'm really really happy about that
because I've been wanting those for so
long they're pretty expensive but I feel
like it's such like a big package and
you use so little of it that I'm never
gonna run out but right now we are going
to Chapel Hill to meet my boyfriend and
to get something that my mom brought
back it is a little while later but it
is still Monday night and I am at ninety
nine thousand nine hundred and ninety
six subscribers you guys that is insane
I think we're gonna hit it tonight
I just went to 97 oh my gosh it's so
cool unlike the live subscriber count'
so you could keep seeing it change but
the championship game just finished I
didn't watch it because I literally
don't care about Alabama or Georgia so I
just like was getting live updates from
my boyfriend but supposedly what's the
craziest game Evers more importantly
we're about to hit 100,000 oh my boy
from sex I mean he was like are you in
sex he said everyone here is so excited
about the game but I'm more excited
about you hitting 100 okay so he says
then he keeps like updating me oh my god

subscribe that's really funny I'm just
so excited inside thankful and I'm
editing at 100k compliation video that
I'm doing and I'm also gonna do a
giveaway I literally have a whole bag of
stuff that I'm giving away so I'm so
excited I have been saving this giveaway
bag for a long time but

nothing to worry about which is nice but
yeah so that's that's the life of a
college student first like a class I

college week in my life that I did
because I did that during like right
before finals week like the last week of

just it's like a juxtaposition or
whatever you're better a word for it the
- yeah - video today and I'm about to

different shades of foundation because
thank you for finally realizing it's
2018 not everyone has the three can fit
into three categories of skin tones
thank you so much black opal for sending
me this though I'm not so excited to try
all of these product my room is clean I
am happy look coming to you from my car
inside Snoopy's hot dogs parking lot
because I'm having car troubles again so
are you sure I'm like one of the first
dates of vlogmas I had car issues and
having them again because my so I went
into a pothole on Hillsborough Street if
you guys are familiar with Raleigh North
Carolina at all it's pretty much just
like construction everywhere and like
there's no place that does all kind of
construction going on right now so we
got into a pot home with a lien that's
always and granted I should have moved
out of the way obviously so in those
comments yes should have moved out of
the way but it's a two-lane road with
construction a giant pothole that took
up over half of my lane I have a photo
of it I'm going to email the city of to
say reimburse me for my car and I could
not go swerve out of the way because it
was oncoming traffic so I tried to like
slam on my brakes and go super super
slowly over the thing and then like
literally 30 seconds after that my car
like stopped right like I felt like it
was like tilting and I thought one of my
front tires had burst so I pulled over
into the Snoopy's parking lot and it
couldn't even Drive like it was making
such a bad noise that like I could not
even drive it into a parking spot so I
stopped it right here so now everyone
thinks I parked like a douche because
I'm literally in like three spots right
now I'm just like horizontal just chill
in my car but and like my car looks fine
from the outside so people would just
probably think I'm like owning like I
own the place or something like that so
but no guys like car troubles and so
we're waiting for triple-a they said it
might take up to an hour and a half
which is ridiculous even when I had to
get triple-a whenever I was on the
highway and my car stopped running
because it was overheated I'm still
waited for triple-a for like 45 minutes
and they put me on emergency so like
triple-a takes forever they've just had
so many car issues and it's so annoying
and I love my car so much but it's just
really annoying because it's just so
many issues and I'm gonna try to get to
say to reimburse me because that's like
the biggest pothole I yeah and I would
not see a photo of it so I still have a
photo and it's still like a pothole but
like they filled it probably because
they heard my car go over it and then
they filled it so I'm hoping that they
can still reimburse me
it's not coming at me oh my god I can't
move I just ordered I can't move it am i
sorry there's so many sunspots on my
lens Triple A it's finally here yes
thank you that is how I have been part
of this entire time so yes I did get
dirty looks I'm celebrating my hundred
thousand subscribers
this is so good oh my god I got a Philly
roll YUM
truffle fries fried pickles a mini
burger edamame
oh my goodness it's not Thursday which
is the last day I will be doing this
week in my life just because I don't
have class on Friday I already went to
class today which feels like forever ago
and I went to the gym and I filmed my
100k so my 100,000 giveaway those of you
guys that know no I have glasses they
are a very low prescription but I do
have glasses and they actually have
prescription in them and I'm supposed to
wear them when I'm like sitting far away
and when I'm tired because if you guys
don't know I have a lazy eye I have like
a super lazy eye the lake makes my
vision a little blurred and my doctor
always tells me to do these eye
exercises and I just never do them so I
know that's bad and I should and I have
like laser eye surgery when I was two
years old and I had to wear a patch I
had all that glasses when I was younger
I just had the whole shebang with like
my eyes so that is why now I do have to
wear these sometimes and I think they're
super cute so I'm gonna wear them today
I'm also gonna take some photos today in
this outfit and I think that looks cute
with the outfit so yeah I know they have
prescription but like I mainly wear them
as an accessory not gonna lie so that's
what I'm up to today and I'm gonna have
my boyfriend take my photo for me and my
hair I'm the surprise I did not heat it
at all this is all just like texturizing
spray so I really really love the way it
turned out and I just wanted to update
you guys and let you know what's going
on today alright so this is the outfit
of the day I think it's super cute I'm
obsessed so I'm wearing these booties
they're healed my ripped jeans from
seven for all mankind they literally
feel like I'm wearing leggings I just so
stretchy my Topshop shirt it says Italia
on it I'm wearing my Natalie necklace
choker glasses denim jacket from Windsor
