week in my life
it is currently 7 7 a.m. that did not
focus I know that but I did 7 a.m. and
I'm already in the cars so I just got
back from New York City last night's
comeback from Beauty Conan and just like
a birthday weekend with my family
because I June 22 on Monday last Monday
so I celebrated that in New York and it
was funny cuz I also celebrated my 15th
birthday there so I was there seven
years later with my family but right now
I'm in the line for Starbucks and yeah I
just want to start the vlog office is
gonna be a college week of my life and
it's also the last ever cartilage we
give my life because it's the last week
of classes forever and I'm about to get
really emotional so I'll talk to you
guys later all right I didn't want to
vlog and drive so I'm back in Raleigh
and I was gonna say that this is the
last college week of my life ever
because it is literally the last week of
college ever for me which is so freaking
weird like this Friday is the last week
of class or last day of classes and I am
done with classes on Thursday I finally
have class Monday through Thursday so
it's just super weird because every year
I'm always like oh wow it's so weird
that it's like the last day of class but
like it's my last day of class probably
forever because I don't think I'm going
to grad school so it's I'm never going
to be back in school again and that is
just bizarre to me and I'm gonna get
emotional and I know I am so you don't
want to do that on camera in the morning
so I'm Way too tired for that so right
now I am on my way to meet with my group
a class is basically just a team time so
it's my senior design project class and
so today it's not like we don't have an
actual class we just have to meet with
our groups so that's what I'm on my way
to do and then after that I'm gonna go
to the gym because I haven't worked it
out in like two weeks because I have
been traveling and it's just really hard
for me to work out while I'm traveling
so yeah this is the gym outfit you like
I've seen it before but I'll show you
again okay so I'm just wearing this
hoodie on the way to class or just like
pull-up sweater or whatever you want to
call it on the way there I'm wearing
this green shirt from Athleta
IKEA cropped leggings and some Nike
shoes so I'm very color-coordinated like
grey grey green the green top like it's
just I look like I'm purposely matching
it is 955 this is never gonna focus it
just doesn't focus on electronics that's
fine
and also got a henna tattoo at beautycon
it'll should wash off after I shower
today but yeah I'm on my way
it's a class early morning I feel like
I've been up forever I just want to show
you guys how this beauty guru goes to
class no makeup just air dried hair
didn't do anything - it's not really bad
and then my super cute monochromatic
outfit alright so I'm meeting my group
and this Rob Lawrence sweatshirt it's a
kids size so it's a little snug it's not
too oversized these Victoria Secret pink
leggings or not leggings yeah right
they're not looking sweat pants that I
got maybe in like softening year of high
school and then my gray Nikes so this is
the fit people are probably like how do
you do fashion videos I don't know it
explained to me I have no idea the next
day and Tuesday afternoon I guess I
didn't have class today because my
teacher actually canceled class so well
that's really nice um so I decided to
come over to check a little to get we're
gonna go on like a Little J and then
we're gonna go first thing in the
morning but since I came over here I was
just like okay by it we can be
but then I'm gonna head back to Raleigh
because I've to film a video but yeah
yeah I love Panera I went down below if
you love hi god these soba noodles with
edamame and the summer corn chowder soup
and it is delicious I love their new
little like protein bowls a lot of them
are vegan and Panera used to never have
any vegan options and then the summer
corn chowder I don't think it's vegan
but it's good so really really ugly day
outside it's pretty cold and wearing a
tank top and I was like freezing when I
stepped out of the car so so happy it's
almost May and still really really
really cold I feel like it's just as
cold as the last week of classes last
semester and those in December I just
got back from Chapel Hill we went to the
gym we got some lunch and now I'm back
and it was raining there and it's not
raining here which is a little weird
because it is so close together but
anyways I am now let's get ready film
the video edit a video upload video I
really really am behind on that I just
procrastinated really no excuses and I
was out of town so I guess that's kind
of an excuse but I was getting in my car
at Chapel Hill this one girl named
nithya I am so sorry if I spelled it
wrong on my Instagram story or if I'm
saying it wrong but came up to me
because she actually recognized kala and
we were like saying goodbye and she had
this like recognized him and came up to
my car and so we know she watches my
videos and seriously if you guys know me
and if you guys have ever met me in
person you guys know that that literally
brightens up my entire day like I am so
happy when that happens like you don't
even know that seriously made my day
like rainy weather grace guys who like I
am so happy when that happens so thank
you so so much for news he has coming up
to my car she was like he's a weird if I
like go up to your car something like
that I was like no that literally makes
me so happy so I just want to give you
guys a big shoutout for just like being
amazing at people I guess but also if
you guys do ever see me in person please
please please please
come up to me like it seriously makes my
day it's not awkward it's not weird I'm
not gonna blow you off like I just makes
me very happy so I definitely met a
handful of you guys like at NC State I
think this is like the first or second
time
anyone at Chapel Hill but it just
brightened up my day and I thought I'd
give it back the guys and I also look
like garbage so that's nice she saw me
in my prime this is the saddest thing I
ever had to pick up let me show you guys
it's my cap and gown I'm so sad I did
not want to pick this up I can't believe
that this is like I remember when I had
my cap and gown from high school and now
I have my cap and gown from college and
it's just really freaking weird about to
fail my Q&amp;amp;A this is the setup of it this
is where I sit so if you guys just want
to see a big overview here it is
everyone what's up it is Natalie here
and I'm so excited to be sitting back
down and filming I just feel like it's
been a while I don't know the last video
I put up was a vlog and I only had one
video out last week which makes me
really sad
I literally started crying in my video
because I was talking about my last week
of college how put that a good laugh
okay now time to edit yeah upload I'm so
weird okay how my night is going oh I'm
just doing this face mask
it's from glam glow I've just had this
on while doing homework so I am
finishing up my part for a group project
for my senior design class and I feel
like I literally cannot move my face
with this face mask on so I was just
sitting in bed doing homework I was
happy I had washed my face and
everything and I've been breaking out so
I really just wanted to like clean my
skin and do this face mask and I'm done
with my homework
so I am about to wash this off and just
watch videos and go to sleep because
it's 10:30 and I normally like to be in
bed like asleep by like 11:30 the latest
so I'm gonna take some melatonin and
I'll see you guys tomorrow
good morning and happy Wednesday I just
woke up and I got my gym outfit on I'm
gonna put a shirt on to go downstairs to
the gym but I just really don't want to
go it's one of those days where I'm just
like I don't want to go to the gym I
woke up the very last possible second
that I could wake up and I'm still
debating like if I should go to the gym
now or after class because I'm just like
so unmotivated right now so maybe if I
had more energy I would you better at
the gym so I don't know I just got
dressed like I'm forcing myself to go
today it's such a mental thing with me
like I can convince myself in three
seconds oh yeah I'm fine I'm gonna skip
the gym but like it takes me a lot to be
like no Natalie you have to go you have
to go you have to go you have to go like
I need the push reporting back like two
minutes after I shut off the last clip I
think I'm gonna convey think I've
convinced myself to go to gym after
class just because one I don't have that
much time right now look I would have to
cut my workout to 30 minutes like I
could not go longer than 30 minutes cuz
I have to get to class so that is a
downside I feel like 90% of the vlog is
literally right here in front of my
window in my room but I went to the gym
after I met with my group but I was just
feeling so beyond tired and like my it
today was arms and I just felt so weak
and I like it could not do any more so
after 15 minutes I stopped doing arms
and then I did a butt workout for like
ten minutes
and then after that I did fifteen minute
yoga so like I was there for like forty
45 minutes but I just could not finish
my arm workout I don't know why but I
just wanted to come on here until you
guys say it is so important to listen to
your body I know that that may have been
mental for me but I really I don't know
my body just felt tired and maybe it's
cuz I haven't been getting sleep or
anything like that but so I stopped
because I wanted to listen to my body
and then I did the butt workout and then
I did yoga and it just felt so good
doing yoga and like just like moving
around and stretching and I feel like I
needed that because I was so sore from
the other two days and I feel like I
didn't properly stretch and I just want
to let you guys know also and encourage
you that just because you're not burning
like 500 calories to a thousand calories
every workout does not mean that you're
not doing some good to your body
I think I only burned like 180 calories
in the whole 40 minutes like I did not
do much at all
but I just needed to move and I mean it
to feel good and it's fine if you're not
constantly like torching calories looks
so much like you just need to 1 listen
to your body that is literally the most
important thing and to realize that just
moving a little bit is enough like your
body thanks you for that so yeah I want
to come on here and tell you guys that
but you don't need to be doing like a
huge hit workout to like feel like
you're actually getting somewhere so
yeah words of encouragement for you guys
about to go meet up with my friend on
campus and we're gonna do some homework
together so this is what I'm wearing so
I already showered and I'm wearing my
Puma sneakers which are like my absolute
favorite I wear these all the time these
jeans are like the girlfriend jeans from
Urban Outfitters they're bdg brand I
love them I think they're like the
perfect like not skinny jeans like I've
been so much more into jeans like this
then skinny jeans now I don't know I
feel like it's like the new thing I'm
wearing just this tube top from brandy
melville
this denim black jacket from Hollister
and then my hair I just put some dry
shampoo in it and called it a day so
it's a little messy but I kind of like
it because my second day curls are not
like messy beachy waves from yesterday
so I like the way it turned out but
today it's my last day of class ever
that is so weird and I messed with this
thing and now it's like this big giant
red thing on my forehead so that's great
but anyways and I'll save class
literally for the rest of my life that
is so bizarre that's so weird I really
want to just document it all because I
just want to have it and I don't know
it's really weird me and my friend we're
texting and we're like we don't believe
that it's our last day like it's not
it's really not the best day in today so
that's just so weird but I just I'm
documenting all making my instant coffee
that I make basically every morning now
it's actually kind of bad but I love it
it's tastes so good and it's just so
quick and easy
alright guys it is we just finished our
very last day of class really this is
really really sad we got a picture but
yeah we're never gonna have to step foot
into the classroom besides taking your
finals only have one final so weird
grown-ups out just got back from the gym
I did a yoga class I soon love yoga my
room is beautiful so I just got back
from a yoga class and I seriously miss
doing yoga because it just makes me feel
so good like I love feeling like I'm
flexible and like stretching my body and
I don't know each I just can tell the
difference and I do yoga and then like a
week later if I go like a week without
doing any yoga I'm less flexible in my
actual workouts so it's just such a good
workout highly recommend I look gross
I'm already late to my group meeting I
have to be there at 1:00 and it's 1252
and it's about 15 minute walk so I'm
already late I'm the best group member I
wanted to shower but obviously I do not
have time so I'm gonna go to my group
project meeting yes we still have to
meet with our group because we still
have final presentations and set a final
exam so we're just touching up on that
but I am done with class I just have to
like wrap up the semester wrap up the
year wrap up the undergrad move I just
got back from meeting with my group and
I lived a look I haven't showered yet so
