beer all over it good morning smoothie
for breakfast so I added some
plant-based protein powder some coconut
milk some PB 2 or it's not PB - but it's
true nut flavor so it's just powdered
peanut butter so this is like the peanut
butter flavor but without the fat in it
it's a really really good and a smoothie
cuz it just makes it taste like peanut
butter a little bit of oats in it I
added some agave to sweeten it I put
some chia seeds in it
I added some spinach then I added some
ice and I also added an avocado in here
and added half of an avocado just
because I don't have a banana that
banana is not mine and then I wanted to
have like a creamy texture so that's why
I did that and it's gonna be delicious
and great for a post-workout
walking to my class and I'm late again
I'm like 15 minutes late that's nice I
just got back from a target run and we
just opened up a target on the street
like that NC State is right by so it's
kind of right next to where I live so
super quick and easy to go to it's like
a minute away in a car and you can walk
there but I just got some groceries that
I feel like I needed because before
break I kind of like emptied out my
fridge so we just got little tiny
groceries and just to keep me until I do
like my big grocery haul so I want to
show you guys what I got Lean Cuisine
love Lean Cuisine so I got three Lean
Cuisines during finals week when I don't
have time to eat this will be good I got
the sesame chicken wine butternut squash
ravioli and the Vermont white cheddar
mac and cheese this is the best mac and
cheese you will ever eat I swear
and then I'm starving so this looks good
so I'm about to make this right now it's
the Jimmy Dean delights English muffin
with turkey sausage egg whites and
cheese so it's only 260 calories and 17
grams of protein so again I'm not gonna
try to eat this every morning but on
days that I don't really have time to
make food I'll be doing this I got some
bread because all my bread goes bad so
quickly so I'm gonna start putting this
in the freezer and just toasting it when
I need it because my bread goes bad so
quickly and it gets so moldy and
disgusting so I got this bread I try to
always get like whole wheat or whole
grain then I got some hummus I got this
Thai sweet chili hummus I'm gonna try
this now and I'll let you guys know if I
like it but I love hummus but I like
spicier hummuses so I'm excited to try
this one out then in this bag I got eggs
and I got my Secret Santa gift so I
don't want to show you guys in case any
of my roommates watch this so I got
Secret Santa gifts for my roommates and
we're doing 12 days of Christmas /
Secret Santa
so ya wanna see what I am getting at for
Secret Santa or what people are getting
be sure to subscribe to my vlog Channel
because I'm doing vlogmas on there and
I'll be showing you guys all of us unbox
and gifts and stuff like that so I'm
really excited it's the best place to
grocery shop turn your Jose
I love the Trader Joe's flowers Tuesday
morning right now and I am headed to the
gym I woke up a little later than normal
so it is 7:50 I normally wake up for
like 6:45 but I was so tired and I think
I'm like more tired when I sleep more
because I went to bed at 9 p.m. last
night so I got a ton of sleep I got a
lot of sleep so I don't know why I was
so tired this morning but yeah
definitely don't regret it sleeping
early but I'm going to go downstairs and
have a little cardio session on the
track my gym outfit of the day so I am
wearing these super cute Nike shoes they
match my top shorts from forever 21 and
this green top from I think Athleta I
also wrote on a little note what I'm
going to be doing so instead of having
to constantly switch apps on my phone
and to look at what's coming up next I
wrote it down in my notes I get these
little treadmill apps or treadmill
workouts from in store for Pinterest so
if you guys want to follow me on
Pinterest you guys can see what workouts
I do but there's so many like just like
hit workouts or treadmill workouts or
interval workouts on Pinterest that are
free and easy to follow yes I'm in a
rush I need to leave in like five to ten
minutes but I just had a bread with some
vegan butter and egg with spinach
scrambled and that's it but I am in a
rush so I gotta eat it takes me about 15
minutes to walk to my class and I just
finished eating breakfast making my
coffee and now I'm going to class but I
have a quiz and they always start five
minutes early so yeah it's not late I
don't really know why I decided to vlog
the last week of classes because I have
four projects do you guys I have four
projects do in a matter of three days so
basically all I am doing is group work
and projects and homework and like I
feel bad because the content of the vlog
isn't great but it is realistic so
completely feel me and understand what
I'm going through with all these
projects comment down below so we can
suffer together and like understand each
other together so right now I made my
car
it's currently 6:30 I'm going to work on
a group project another one and I was
just with my group two hours ago but we
took a little break because you know we
needed to breathe and not eat and so now
I am off to work on the great project
and I'm going to be telling them though
that I need to be done by 10:00 because
of Tori Secret Fashion Show is on
tonight and I need a break okay so I am
going to be done by 10 o'clock
I watched the fashion show every single
year I just love watching it it's
interesting hi this year I've been
seeing so many pictures of it everyone
looks amazing as always and tomorrow you
know I'm gonna be in the gym but yeah so
I am gonna be like hey like I have an
obligation at 10 so can this wrap up in
three hours I'm not excited at all but
hopefully you guys will see me make it
out alive this month or this month this
week this week feels like a month though
but it's exciting because I know because
honestly I'm not even gonna be as bad as
this week because of how many things I
have do and I don't know I'm a senior
it's my first like I have a job offer
I've accepted a job offer I'm just like
I just want to be done you guys so if
you guys feel me let me know guess who
didn't watch the Victoria's Secret
Fashion Show because she was working
with her group this girl right here yep
the plan plan did not work well of me
telling them too bad I gotta leave
because it was just me and one other
group member so it's two out of the four
crew members that were there and
obviously I was not about to be that
member it doesn't do any work because we
all know who those people are we all
don't like them so I had to stay the
whole time we actually got quite a bit
done which is really nice because for
the first two hours we did not get
anywhere we didn't know know how to
start we didn't know what to do we
completely restarted our project it was
just a big giant mess so we didn't
really do much but then we finally got
somewhere we broke through the ice and
we we're like on a track now is it the
right track
is it a track yes better than where we
were I also don't really care what I get
anymore because I don't know I'm done I
am so done tomorrow is the last day of
this class or ever and I am so excited
with that being said it's 11 o'clock
which is way past
bedtime so I'm going to take one of
these babies or two of these babies and
try to get some sleep because I love
taking these they taste so good I feel
so come to eating candy and I don't know
they're just probably put me to sleep
right away this is the gym outfit of the
day white shirt from fabletics pants
from Victoria's Secret Nike sneakers it
is 7 a.m. and I am exhausted we are done
with the gym and Ali and I went this
morning woke up super early to go to the
gym and those take the stairs back up
like you know if you get a little
healthier I guess but today was arms and
I hate arms I think arms is like the
worst day possible because I feel like
my arms are not that way so it's just
like hard anytime I do any sort but I'm
just like getting it done early so I
review my workout in before my eighth
duty class which is really nice
Ali's trying to be healthy and doing
this apple cider vinegar detox which I
agree it's super good for you yeah I
should be doing that I've done it before
I've done it maybe like three times in
my life apple cider vinegar with water
shedded all these other ingredients in
it but she has never had apple cider
vinegar so don't smell it okay
it's good I was not expecting that
it's like apple cider sucks but it's not
the worst it's not it's the nose the
lemon and the honey helped a lot yeah
but I would chug it would you because
that taste is gonna get old check check
check
I am off to class I normally when I have
my 8:30 a.m. I just got right after I
work out and then I do like the rest of
my stuff later like shower eat
everything else later so I'm up to that
but this morning I really wanted to get
a protein shake and I really wanted to
make one but I did not have my blender I
just ordered a blender online and it's
like a super powerful great blender it
was my very first like adult purchase I
will be taking with me when I move out
of here and get my first big-girl job in
like big-girl apartments so I was really
excited but yeah so I'm getting a really
nice blender is this what I don't think
feels like getting excited over like
kitchen appliances I think it is right
now I am getting ready so I sometimes
just get ready on my floor and in front
of this mirror over here just because
it's easier and I'm like right by my
makeup and stuff like that but right now
I'm just getting ready so I just did my
makeup and normally I don't wear makeup
to class but I was like I cannot be in
the vlog without makeup at all
so I know it's makeup over you guys so I
just did a very simple look this really
isn't anything special at all but at
least I look a little more put together
than what I normally look like and
honestly when I look good I feel better
so I decided to you know step up my step
of the makeup a game because I never
wear makeup to class like most of my
classmates probably don't see me with
makeup on unless I film a video if I
have makeup up to class probably filmed
a video that day and I'm just sitting on
my floor and I'm watching Nagin's vlogs
absolutely love her she's one of my
favorite vloggers and I want to make my
vlogs like her but like my life isn't as
interesting as her um but I really
really love her vlogs and just her
personality and like it's really cute so
I love her photos on Instagram so yeah
I'm just putting my makeup away right
now
because don't want a mess the last thing
that I need I'm gonna show you guys what
I'm wearing right now it's really simple
I don't really have any jewelry on but
I'm wearing this really cute soft fuzzy
top this is from boutique near me I
don't really remember what it's called
but it's just a simple boutique and I
think it's supposed to be off the
shoulder I don't really know but it's
probably not gonna happen so just keep
it on the shoulder wearing these ripped
skinny jeans from American Eagle and I
don't have shoes on right now but I'll
probably wear some like booties or I
don't know maybe
Yam booties will probably look good with
this and a cute little necklace on
Thursday and another day another day at
the gym so my outfit right now this
shirt I literally don't know where it is
it's just says I'm not a Shopaholic I'm
just helping the economy which true
these leggings are from fabletics
they're super cute really really like
them they have like the see through the
bottom of them the mesh and then just
some Nike shoes you know where my really
disgusting looking face but I had such a
weird experience at the gym today so I
want to tell you guys so I went to a gym
like I always do when I normally go with
my roommate or normally someone's
already there like I normally never have
the gym like completely to myself but
this time I had the gym like 100% to
myself there was no one in there and I
was like on the treadmill and my
treadmill faces like a big giant window
in the pool view is outside and it's
like dead of when I mean it's like not
hot outside anymore like the pools not
even open so if anyways there was this
guy out there and he was like walking
around just like I don't know he was
like my age or maybe a little younger I
don't know he looks like he was a
college student for sure but he was
walking around and just like looked very
confused and like I kept seeing him
maybe like every like 10 minutes like he
would go in you go back out and then
he'd go back in and like I saw him maybe
three times out there and then I heard
something like in the gym so I like
turned around and he was in there and I
was like kind of freaked out not gonna
lie
and so I was just like oh like like he
was talking to me and he was like hey
like mm can you go to the girls bathroom
and just see if my backpacks and they're
like I lost my backpack and I I need to
know if it's in there
and in my head I'm just like okay that's
so weird like he was a I'm looking for
my backpack like I just need can you
just go in the girls bathroom and see
and like in my head I'm just like okay
no like I don't know who you are there's
literally no one here it's like 7:00
a.m. like knock on the girls bathroom
and see if you can enter in a second
why would your backpack be in the girls
bathroom and like if it was in the girls
bathroom why were you looking outside by
the pool for it
very weird vibes I was honestly very
freaked out I was like what if he wants
me to go in there because he wants to
like murder me or he wants to who knows
you know like I don't know and so I was
just like um like you I was like there's
no one in there like you can just knock
and he's like can you just go in and
check and I was like I mean like no like
you can just go and knock like I
promised no one's in there and he like
got annoyed I think I like walked out
but it was just so uncomfortable then
like a second later some guy walked in
and like started working out so that
made me feel better but I was just
thinking like as girls we constantly
have to think about this and I'm not
saying that this doesn't have ngoz
either like of course it does but like
as girls naturally I think or I don't
know if we're taught or if it's just in
us but we're fearful when like we're
alone in a situation and something like
out of the blue happens like that could
have been if it was a girl asking me to
do that or if it was a girl being like
hey have you seen my backpack I wouldn't
even have thought twice and I know
that's probably not like completely
right like a girl just as easily could
do it as a guy could I had naturally I'm
just like oh my gosh like this random
guy that's acting a little sketchy his
stories are really matching up not that
really his stories aren't matching up
but just like it was a super weird
situation and I wanted to share with you
guys but yeah it really freaked me out
because I thought it was weird when I
saw him at the pool I was like what is
he doing at 7:00 a.m. looking outside
like I had your back I'd be at the pool
or in the girls bathroom and like
literally no alone was downstairs so
yeah that just really freaked me out I
was happy that the other guy walked in
um because I don't know it just made me
feel safer with two people in the gym
and such as just one so I was gonna
leave but after he came and I was about
to leave I was like okay like this
probably isn't the same as for me maybe
it is but maybe it's not so but then
that guy walked in so I felt fine but
and I like know who he is so it was all
good but yeah it was it was definitely
weird
let me know if you guys will see way
about me if you're a girl for your guy
like
because I feel like sometimes like even
with my boyfriend and stuff like that
remember one time he dropped me off at
this restaurant and he was like how are
you gonna get back like do you me pick
me up or do you just want to walk and
I'm like I can't walk by myself at night
like you have to come back to pick me up
you know and he was just like wow like I
never like that would have never crossed
his mind like oh I can't walk outside at
night alone but for me I will never walk
outside alone and in the dark like at
night I just don't like doing that I
don't even like walking like to my car
if it's like like half a block away just
because I feel so unsafe especially
around college campuses like we always
hear of things on college campuses so
I'm just let you guys know that be safe
um always going pairs of two and yeah I
don't know let me know if you guys feel
the same way this is my go-to breakfast
basically every morning like I've shown
this in so many videos but I just had
toast
half of an avocado or a mini avocado
some egg I overcooked it this time
though and spinach and a bunch of
sriracha sauce because I am obsessed
with sriracha
Oh Christmas out so we're doing 12 days
of Christmas and Jamie had me for Secret
Santa
Julie hat I have Julie julie has Ali Ali
has Giggy yeah but all of these gifts I
have not put out one gift yet but I'm
going to target right now and I'm about
to buy a bunch and like other stores and
yeah forget right now we're shopping for
Secret Santa all in over there in the
candle section I think target candles
are so good and underrated honestly they
smell so good they've actually raised
their prices though they're like the
same price now as Bath and Body Works

for more like of a winter wine though
