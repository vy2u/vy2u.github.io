start of my weekend in my life also
completely gonna wear my like ghostly
pale super disgusting face compared to
my tan body because myself sand and I
don't felt in my face so I never noticed
the difference what I'm not wearing
makeup but yeah it's it's harsh it is
currently a Friday morning and I wanted
to film one weekend in my life because I
always feel weak in my life's but I'd
never show you guys my weekend and so I
really wanted to do one of these and I
think it'll be a lot of fun because this
weekend it was kinda like a snow weekend
so we don't have any class all week and
it was great so if you live on the East
Coast you probably had a snow day too
and yet today I'm just gonna go to the
gym right now wearing my gym outfits and
the snow is not stopping me from working
out trying to be quiet because like this
apartment walls are so thin and everyone
can hear me but I'm really excited to
show you guys this weekend in my life
just because it's sneak peek that I
haven't shown you guys before this is my
outfit of the gym for today so it is
from super dry super cute I actually
have never worn this before so I'm
excited to see how like these workout
clothes like feel when I work out
because I'm a huge Nike fan so I always
like finding new brands but I'm wearing
these Nike shoes that I got for
Christmas and so many of you guys asked
her they were from and I literally could
not find them on the website so I just
like never responded to those comments
and then someone found them and they pin
the comment so I'm gonna have these link
down below so not gonna lie today is one
of those days when I woke up and I was
debating texting Ally saying I don't
want to go to the gym today I'm so tired
but I just got myself up and I was like
you know what no like why don't I want a
good gym just cuz I wanna lay in bed
more like yeah your body needs rest but
I slept perfectly fine I was just like
being like I don't wanna go to the gym
so - I motivated myself to get up get
out of it and get my lazy butt up and
then I'm going to take some pre-workout
because whenever I feel like so like
tired and like lacking of energy I do
take pre-workout I don't take it every
single morning because I normally don't
need it but normally towards the tail
end of the week or just some days when
I'm just feeling lazy and unmotivated I
take that because that's like my extra
push that I need
for breakfast we made some avocado toast
with eggs and I feel like every time I
vlog this is the breakfast I really
don't need it that often but I have
sriracha salt pepper garlic powder whole
wheat bread and half of a tiny avocado
so I really only have like a quarter of
a normal size avocado and two eggs and
Elia made the breakfast while I cleaned
and unloaded the dishwasher so it's a
good team I finally got out of bed and
started getting ready for my day and
this is my outfit I don't have shoes on
yet but I'm wearing these black skinny
jeans from 7:00 for all mankind
I wear these all the time they have cute
little rips and then I have two shirts
on so I decided to layer I got this
inspo from Pinterest comment down below
if you guys go on Pinterest you find
alpha inspo but I have this cropped
sweater with this like longer just like
t-shirt that it stripes and I think it
looks really good together because like
the necklines it's not like weird ethnic
lines or anything it's like the perfect
length it doesn't look like you know
when you used to layer in elementary
school yeah it doesn't look like that
and then I just left my hair from the
day before so it's second day hair
ran a coffee shop where there is a lot
of being a talk show and it also has
like pokeballs at sushi and like
breakfast food and it's just like a
really really fun place I've had really
great suit here we don't worry about it
but I just got their crack coffee which
has a nut oil and butter and and it's
really really good and we also went to
get a drink and now we're doing work and
use honor a lot of problems at staffs
can't yeah we just some pictures and
which one of those are coming downtown
from all aboard
good morning everyone I'm about I just
woke up and it's currently like 9:30 and
I am on my way to my 10:00 a.m. yoga
class so I'm so excited and I'm bringing
my roommates with me so none of them
actually one of them but the other like
two of them have never done yoga before
and I'm so excited to show it to them
because I'm a huge fan of yoga I think
it is such a great workout and it's just
like a complete different workout that
I'm used to because I'm so used to doing
like strength training and this is just
so good to do for me at the end of the
week and I absolutely love it so comment
down below your favorite workout to do
so if we see what absolutely once or I
can be introduced to other ones this is
my yoga outfit though I really really
like it the sports bras from forever 21
and it's seriously so cute forever 21 by
the way it has the best workout clothes
ever
I don't wear their leggings but like
tops sports bras short like shorts
anything it is the best and it's so
affordable so this is from forever 21
and my leggings are from Lululemon and
they are the seamless ones so they are
so be uncomfortable it feels like I'm
honestly naked sometimes we just got
back from at the grocery store and for
those rights that were wondering I go
grocery shopping at Trader Joe's for the
most part and if you guys want to see a
grocery haul let me know
all right so I just finish and I want to
show you guys a little glimpse of what
we got but if you guys want me to do an
actual like grocery haul like whole
video on my main channel let me know all
of these like healthy ingredients
because Ali and I have been doing so
freaking well on eating healthy like oh
my gosh we have only eight ounce once
this whole entire week and I think it
was one Monday
oh and yesterday we went to get drinks
but like so yesterday and Monday was the
only time we actually ate out and like
our meals were so cheap both times and
not like super bad for you yesterday is
like a little cheat meal with us okay um
and now we have been just getting so
many ingredients that like we can
actually make stuff with so instead of
just getting frozen food and processed
food and all this stuff that's just like
not requiring you to cook we get a lot
of ingredients that require you to cook
just so that we can know what we're
putting in our bodies eat healthier
Trader Joe's are so good at that just
because it is so much cheaper to get
these ingredients like this week we
spent 50 dollars each on groceries so
100 dollars and this is the most that we
have ever spent on groceries and we got
enough to last us for probably two weeks
I would say like a week and a half to
two weeks all of this stuff isn't a lot
cents yeah yeah this is the most we've
ever spent so this will probably last us
like two weeks and we still have some
stuff from the last time so yeah this is
gonna last us for so long in like $50
yeah it's not cheap but like $50 I can
spend that on like four meals out versus
two weeks of meals out so it's just so
much better to eat in and I definitely
what we have been trying to do here's a
little overview of what we got so
coconut milk we have been trying to cut
out dairy so we're not vegan obviously
we got like steak and chicken and stuff
but we've been trying to cut out dairy
as much as possible so I don't think one
thing that we got has Oh cottage cheese
besides that nothing else has dairy here
so we got cauliflower pizza crust this
crust from Trader Joe's is amazing we
have what else we got vegan cream cheese
because we are gonna make a vegan mac
and cheese
umm coconut milk is like the only milk I
drink now a lot of vegetables vegetables
is definitely essential to keep your
fridge stock
brights cauliflower because we want to
make some like chicken fried rice but
the cauliflower instead of normal rice
avocados of course and we get the baby
ones because this is more of like an
actual portion that you're supposed to
eat bananas some fruit except fruit from
Trader Joe's it's pretty expensive so we
normally go to like our other
supermarket for that got some chickpeas
eggs we're hard boiling some eggs right
now so that we can have those as a snack
but overall I think we have been doing
really really well and I'm super proud
of us
if you guys know me you know that I
absolutely love my Starbucks and my
coffee but I have been drinking from the
Nespresso machine lately and using
coconut milk instead and it has been
saving me so much money because it
literally tastes exactly like Starbucks
and it's so good so I've only got two
Starbucks once this entire week and it
was when I drove from home to Raleigh so
I'm very proud of myself so this blog is
very like me kind of bragging on myself
just because I really want to stick to
all of these things that I'm doing I
don't just want it to be a one week long
thing does anyone else's room get like
this after the weekend I'm just so
confused and I don't understand comment
down below and after weekend that you
guys are just so confused as to how your
room gets so beyond messy because I just
don't understand what I do like I just
feel like because it's the weekend I'm
like oh I got I gotta like code and not
have time to clean or something I don't
know I feel like on during the week I'm
so productive and on top of my stuff and
my weekend it's like my not so
productive days so I really want to
change that I just wanna be productive
all the time because then I'm like I
have to clean all of this up and it's
just so much whenever I clean my room
though I always put on a youtube video
and I watch my favorite youtubers and
catch up on it and right now watching
Claudius Lewis Keys video she's
literally one of my absolute favorites
so let me know what who your favorite
youtuber is right now I am doing a
devotional and I decided to start on a
new book because I just finished the
book of Matthew and so I am starting on
Ecclesiastes but I just finished reading
the first chapter of Ecclesiastes and
it's basically a king that had
everything so Solomon was the writer of
this book and he had literally
everything like women money power you
name it like something that a lot of
people probably look up to him too
and I feel like this is really relevant
today not necessarily in terms of like
royalty or anything but there's so many
people that we look up to that are like
Instagram famous or I know at least in
like the beauty community and other
communities it might be like the royal
family or it might be like athletes or
whatever but we look to these people
with money and we look to these people
with Fame and power and influence and
we think that they have it all and like
I've literally had gotten comments on my
videos like oh you're just like a rich
rich dumb girl whose parents pay for
anything like you don't have struggles
whatever like something like that in one
of my videos that I posted and I was
just like you literally don't know me
like you don't know me at all you have
no idea like anything about my life
besides what I decide to show you guys
and I'm only gonna show you the good
things you know but this in the book it
basically says like how everyone's gonna
die everyone's gonna eventually no one's
gonna remember who you are right now in
a three hundred years from now people
are not going to remember the people
that were famous now today and so it's
just thinking like how do you want to
live your life do you really want to
focus it on gaining more money gaining
more power gaining more possessions and
just like kind of a selfish way of
living or do you actually want to make
an impact and serve a loving God or just
make an impact on people because that is
something that will be remembered not
something that will be rewarded and so I
don't know it's just really really great
for me to read this this morning because
I kind of like that's kind of a wake-up
call to me like yeah like how do I want
to live my life and also for you guys
just showing here how like you might
look like you have it all but you have
no idea the struggles that people are
going through I know this is like a
dumbed down version of my devotional but
I'll link it down below because I do
online devotionals if you guys want to
do them but yeah I just want to share
with you guys because it's really really
important to realize that everyone's
going through their own chuckles and
also eventually we're all gonna die as
sad and morbid as it is it's true death
is inevitable and when that happens how
do you want your life to have been lived
like if you died today would you be okay
yeah sorry I didn't mean to get super
deep on you guys but I just felt like I
want to share that with you and if you
guys like when I share these devotionals
or if you don't like it let me know but
I like sharing them with you basically
all day Sunday I just have been laying
in my bed so that's why this vlog is a
little boring on Sunday I just want you
to photo on Instagram and it's saying
that I'm going to California over spring
break so I'm super super excited so I
will be there from March 2nd to the 7th
so it's just
a really short period of time but if any
of you guys are wanting to collaborate
or anything like that with like
photography YouTube anything shoot me a
DM on Instagram because I really want to
make a lot of connections while I am
there and I also want to plan more trips
to LA just because I feel like that's
like the best place to go for a youtuber
just to collaborate and get like make
connections and everything like that and
YouTube friends are there so also if you
guys aren't youtubers and you're just
watching my video comment down below a
youtuber that you want me to collaborate
with and I won't try to get in contact
with them because I think it's so much
fun to do that and I'd love to know so
comment down below your favorite
youtuber that you would love for me to
do a video with and to meet and I'm
excited for this to actually happen and
yeah so I'm just gonna close out the
vlog here I really hope you liked it I
