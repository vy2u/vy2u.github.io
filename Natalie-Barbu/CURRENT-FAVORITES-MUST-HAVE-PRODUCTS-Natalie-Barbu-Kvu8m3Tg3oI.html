today I am filming a video that takes me
back to like the good old YouTube days
when everyone did favorites videos and I
feel like I just haven't updated you
guys on any of my favorite products
lately but I really want to do a current
favorites video so this could be the
month of October favorites fall
favorites this is just products that
I've been loving for a while and some of
them I've just kind of started loving
and then others I've been kind of like
cult favorites for me I've been loving
them for a while so I really hope that
you guys enjoy this video and if you are
new to my channel please be sure to
subscribe I love it if you guys could
join the fam and I kind of want to call
us like Barbie dolls or something like
that I think that's really cute so let
me know what you guys think and we are
just gonna get started into the video I
want to let you guys know that this
video is sponsored by Sphinx razors and
I absolutely love this product though
and I'm gonna show you how I use it what
it does and everything like that but I
like being as transparent with you guys
as I can but this product has been such
a lifesaver for me I have been
absolutely loving this little baby right
here and this is a razor by the way I
know it's super cute and it doesn't look
like one but like it is so this has
basically been a lifesaver for me in
terms of like touch-ups and when I'm on
the go and I forgot a spot to shave
because you know that happens and if it
doesn't happen on your knees like that
is where my bad spot is I don't know if
let me know what your bad spot is but I
always miss like the side of my knees or
just like a strip on my leg I have a
spray bottle so you can have like water
to make sure that you're not dry shaving
because that is so beyond painful
it has a shaving moisturizer so it has
this shaving gel with that it comes in
stick form and it's actually like a
shaving cream so that you're not cutting
yourself so ho and it doesn't melt in
your car it doesn't melt in the heat
like it is such a great product you guys
and I don't use this in the shower
obviously this is just for touch-ups but
it's really really great for something
so portable just to make sure that
you're not getting cut or anything like
that it comes with two single blade
razors which is really nice this is so
that the razors don't get clogged and
they're also refillable I just keep this
in my
and it's so so easy it's portable if you
forget a spot you now don't really have
to worry and it's really cute so if
anyone sees this in your bag it's not
like they're like why is a razor in your
purse because that's a little weird so
if you guys are interested I will have
it linked down below but yeah this is
just for touch-ups I definitely have not
replaced my main razor with this but
just for touch-ups I think this is such
a smart and innovative product that I
haven't seen before so it's really
excited to test it and it works really
really well you guys so I will have this
linked and be sure to check out thanks
also you can get all these products at
Ulta so if you guys want the 6 razor or
any other of these products I will have
all the links down below these are all
available at Ulta Ulta is my go-to I'm
telling you guys it's cheaper than
Sephora and it has just as good of
products so the next favorite of mine is
because I get pasty-white in the winter
and I hate it and I get super white in
the fall and I still want to have that
glow so I self-tan
so this Saint Tropez is we might go to
four years now and I've never done a
tanning your teen but that's something
that you guys aren't interested and let
me know but this date - right I get the
darker color and it is the best Hanning
one I've got all my friends hooked on
this and you basically and I have like
it all over the bottle so now it's
getting on me that's good anyways this
bar oh my god okay I'm just gonna put it
on my knee and like I'll live it up
later that is my go-to for when I am
super super pale because it makes me
literally look like I just came back
from Miami and it looks I makes me look
like so glowing and tan I know it's like
the middle of the winter so it might
seem fake but it does not give us give
off an orange tan or anything at all so
if you guys want a good self-tanner
Kylie I highly recommend that and if you
guys want Anna your teen video you guys
can let me know too because I would
definitely be down to do that my next
favorite is going to be skincare so
during the school year I don't really
like wearing makeup that much I never
ever ever wear makeup to class unless
I'm literally filming a video so like my
friends know that I filmed the video
today because I wore makeup to class so
I really am NOT a big makeup wear person
I just if I do it super minimal because
I don't know I just feel like it's a
hassle to put on and then take
and I just want to feel confident and
comfortable in my own skin I have been
taking extra steps on my skincare
routine and one of my favorite things
that I have been using is the
stemologica pre cleanse so this takes
off your makeup it's an oil so you do
this before you wash your face this
isn't a face wash or your face like
cleansing oil it's just it makes you
take all your makeup off with just one
little pump so put one pump of this oil
and I rub it all over my face and I take
my makeup off like that and then I wash
my face right afterwards I have been
liking this so much more the makeup
wipes makeup wipes I feel like never
really took off all of my makeup made me
break out more and this even though it
isn't oil I feel like it just hydrates
my skin because then right afterwards
you're washing your face so it's not
like the oil is staying on your skin I
highly recommend trying out one of these
or like a balm or one of those things
that you just like wipe your makeup off
with the next few favorites of mine are
moisturizers and so I have been really
really loving these two moisturizers you
can get these at Ulta like I said all of
these things I'm lucky because I could
go to all - the way too often the
Pacifica coconuts probiotic water repair
cream which boost hydration fight a skin
hangover plus coconut water and vegan
probiotics so all of that stuff
basically I just like it because it's a
great moisturizer it smells amazing and
it really hydrates your skin I use this
at night it says that it's for all skin
types
especially stress and you need to I am
stressed you can tell in my skin when I
wake up I actually feel like I look
absolutely disgusting which is why I
have to have such a good skincare
routine so I always feel like under-eye
circles or like I just look tired and
don't like worn out and so this has been
great for me this semester especially
and the finals coming up and test coming
up you know your skin like it really
does take ahold of it so I like this
because it's super super hydrating and
then in the morning before I do my
makeup the moisturizer that I use is the
Burt's Bees brightening even skin tone
moisturizing cream with daily extracts I
just feel like this makes my makeup so
like it makes my skin already vibrant
because like I said I don't look that
hot in the morning so I need some
brightener so this just brightens my
skin up without putting makeup on I'm
really really trying to have a great
skincare routine so that I don't have to
wear makeup that's kind of like the
whole point so I've been using this in
the mornings it's Burt's Bees it's not
expensive
it's really great and if you just start
use a brightening moisturizer I feel
like your skin will just look a lot
better and that kind of like defeats an
extra or take some like makes you look
like you're wearing at least a little
bit of makeup on ask for makeup my
favorite product it's been this Smashbox
first of all can we talk about packaging
this is amazing it's like a hologram or
whatever those are called but I have
just been loving these fall colors I
have it on my eyes right now actually if
you guys were wondering I'm very into
the whole orange tones and I didn't want
to spend fifty five dollars I think on
the naked 4 palette it's the fourth one
I don't even know what palette is yet
but it's so gorgeous you guys it's
perfect for fall so please get your
hands on this because it is the most
perfect fall shade and the next makeup
product I've been using I actually have
all my lips right now it is this NYX
metallic it's mixed cosmic metals so I
just really really like it because it's
super sparkly but it stays on so it's
lip gloss but it's kind of like a dry
gloss like your hair doesn't really
stick in it and it's it stays on for a
while so this is kind of like a liquid
lipstick but liquid Gulag I mean I guess
like a gloss that stays on like a
24-hour gloss and it's so it just makes
your lips pop it makes them so sparkly
um I have been loving this shade too you
guys can see it's on my lips right now
it kind of matches the eyes just been
really into orange shades lately for
fall so when I do wear makeup I pick
this up homeless everything and last but
not least I want to talk about hair so
again with school year I'm super
minimalistic which is funny because I do
do these like YouTube videos that are
like life style and fashion and whatever
but like if you see me in class I really
am NOT like glamorous at all I tried to
do the least amount of work and effort
with still looking kind of decent and
like alive so I have been using this
living proof perfect hair day it's the
in shower styler I just put this from my
roots to the ends of my hair once it's
wet and it just kind of gives you a
blown out like wavy beachy texturized
look without putting any heat on it so I
will walk to class with my hair
sometimes and I will just have this in
it and it turns out like this by the end
of the day so I really really like
I didn't do anything to my hair today at
all I just air dried it and I think this
is an awesome hair product pretty
expensive though living proof is not
cheap I got the small one to test it out
but I would recommend getting one of
these in showers stylers I'm definitely
like such a lazy person when it comes to
my beauty routine I have tried to slim
it down a lot and tried to be more
efficient with my time so here are my
favorite products of the month and of
kind of like the past couple months I've
been using a lot of these products
certainly if they guys enjoyed this
video and let me know what you guys
think in the comments below if you guys
like these favorites videos what type of
videos you want to see cuz I am kind of
in a rut right now be sure to follow me
on all my social media and check out
Sphinx in the bottom bar below or the
