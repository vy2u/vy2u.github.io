this intro we're just gonna say that
quality camera because I'm filming on my
computer but don't worry the rest of the
videos in good quality I just kind of
forgot to film the intro so I'm just
doing it while I'm editing my videos on
my laptop so hey um this is one of my
kind of favorite videos to do but it's I
filmed it very differently than I feel
most of my videos um I filmed it okay so
I was just outside of my sister kind of
awkward though cuz I was just like you
know like just pretending to make these
really cute faces for the video and um
it's like with no music of everything
it's kind of weird and I'm doing her
voiceover and I have one direction
playing the background oh my gosh

direction or else I don't think of good
taste of music because I love one
direction um yeah so that's pretty much
it oh I did I describe what this video
is I mean if you hear the title but it's
um holiday outfits and it's just like
different settings I could be in kind of
yeah um it's a pretty quick video
because I kind of cropped it Oh a lot so
I had to rerecord my voice like 20 times
because I kept money to say more and I
only had about 30 seconds to describe
each outfit
so I described it in about 30 seconds
see how that works please don't be like
oh why don't you describe better or
whatever it's like I only have 30
seconds dude sorry like sorry about it
really help you enjoyed this video and
now let's get started
thumbs up for more direction bring One
Direction to Miami or I bring one
direction New York oh my god going look
at my nails sorry they were really
really ugly in the video I was like
trying to hide them the whole time and
my toes because he's no look now weird
cuz I'm saying cross-legged but cuz like
my toes are really bad too so I had to
have close to it shoots well then let's
winter so it wasn't that hard alright so
by now enjoy the video
this first alpha is a really good outfit
if you're invited to a holiday party
that isn't too formal it's just an
oversized cardigan that I got from New
York and company a tank top from from 21
as well as the shorts are from forever
21 and some Sam Edelman shoes the shirt
has some lace detailing as you can tell
and it has sort of like a pearl
waistline not really sure how to
describe it but you get the picture the
shorts are super sparkly because you
can't do holiday parties without
sparkles it's like a holiday party fool
and if the ring is super cute from
American Eagle I don't exactly know how
to describe it but all I know is that
your kids and the shoes are Sam
Edelman's and they just have studs all
over them and if you didn't know those
are my favorite pair shoes
this next outfit is for a medium to a
party it's just all Sparkle and glam
it's gone forever 21 and there was like
$29 who's already cheats you will
definitely be the center of attention in
this dress but in a good way and many
people don't like jewelry with statement
dresses but I think the opposite my
necklace is from American Eagle and as
you can tell it hides very well together
um my earrings are like she don't really
know where my earrings are from but you
could find support ones those shoes are
from Aldo and you kind of want the
sheets to be nude so that most attention
goes to your upper house this next
outfit is kind of here in a coffee run
Starbucks around just hanging out with
friends I love this outfits very cozy
chic it's just kind of a big tunic is
all I could describe it as it's from
forever 21 black up jeans and just a
skin colored undershirt with a real cute
furry headband the shirt is kind of I
don't even know the detailing it's not
crochet but has like my shoes are the
cutest they have a big fuzzball on them
and they're from the death they're
actually slippers so that you can
actually break the dress code and
without anyone knowing my earrings are
from Target I believe and they're just
very simple bronze earrings you don't
know what the joy to be the main focus
my headband thingy I don't even know
it's from American Eagle and it's my
absolute favorite part of this outfit
sevens Robin pen Jean and far between
you and undershirt who said Christmas
sweaters have to be ugly and tacky not
me whoops forgot a picture sorry about
that it's just a really cute big sweater
and deli screens Christmas I got mine
from American Eagle there's a guy
walking
oh well and I'm wearing gray leggings
and signed up some like riding boots
don't really know I mean you for any
type of just black suits
I really love this sweater at Central
Park it's a big no place on it so cute
doing the opening presents looking like
an aviator really my shoes are from
Dillard's and they're like black riding
boots and they're so comfortable sweater
