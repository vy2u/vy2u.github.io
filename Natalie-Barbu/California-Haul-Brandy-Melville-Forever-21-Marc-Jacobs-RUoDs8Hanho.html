am filming a california hall for you
guys i recently went to California and
for vacation my family it was our last
trip as a family this summer before I go
to college and I did buy a couple things
and I really just wanted to show you
guys what I got because I had a lot of
fun shopping so I went to San Francisco
and we went shopping in union square for
quite of at a time and then I also went
to Los Angeles and I didn't really go
shopping there as much as San Francisco
it was all so beautiful we went we
arrived in LA and then we drove five
hours to San Francisco and then we drove
back down but we took the pacific coast
highway and so we just stopped in little
cities in between so beautiful if you
follow me on instagram i have so many
pictures that i put up and i loved it so
much california is awesome and i'm not
quite sure if i would actually want to
live live there especially not in LA I
don't know how you guys deal with that
traffic but I don't think I could do
that but I loved Santa Barbara if any of
you guys are from Santa Barbara please
calm down below because your city is
beautiful but anyways let's just get
right into the hall and I'm very excited
to show you guys what I got okay so
first things first this is what my
sister got so I actually did not
purchase it it was not mine but we do
share clothes so I really want to show
you guys she got this with her own money
so all credit to her my older sister not
my little sister and it is moving to the
Marc Jacobs store in San Francisco and
they were having a huge sale like
seventy percent off a bunch of stuff
like half the store so my sister picked
up this bag it is marc jacobs not marc
by marc jacobs like actually marc jacobs
it has a chain strap to it and it has
all of these metal rings on it I love it
we got it let's see if we can open it
okay i'm pretty sure it's actually long
i think oh gosh okay
okay I opened in okay so anyways you
open it and very difficult I'm not sure
if I just made it harder than it
actually is and then the inside is just
a plain bag it has a couple pockets on
the side so the next thing I got is from
forever 21 and I have actually already
worn this it is a sweater but with short
sleeves so it's just kind of like a
cable night or just like a knitted thing
so here's what it looks like it is
American themed so it just says the flag
on it short sleeve it's not cropped but
it's definitely not long so to really
like it's like a box fit so I'm sorry I
just like I feel like half my head is
cut off okay perfect so yeah it's just
like very boxy I love it I wear it with
some denim jeans and I thought it looked
really good so here it is the next thing
I got from forever 21 was actually some
pjs and I call the pjs I don't know if
you guys call them pajamas same thing
this is the top it says anything is
possible dr dot with coffee i love
coffee so I thought this shirt suited me
so it's just a plain blue flowy super
soft shirt and then the shorts that go
with they're so cute they're the same
color they're just really short and they
just have blue coffee cups all over them
and I thought that was adorable and I am
heading to college soon and I feel like
living with a roommate I should probably
even though it's just pjs I kind of
wanted a couple that match cuz I
literally don't have like any pjs that
match all i have is t-shirts and that's
sweatpants or random shorts so i wanted
to get at least one matching pajama top
and bottom the next thing I got from
forever 21 um it is from their athletic
wear it is
this shirt with a halter and then an
open bag and I'm gonna be honest with
you I'm not going to wear this to work
out I feel like this is not very
comfortable to work out like open back
halter top like I'd rather just wear
sports broad like a tank top or
something like that so I decided this
honestly looks like an actual shirt and
I've always wanted a short that has an
open back but I'm always like what raw
do i wear with it because I really don't
like the sticky boobs so I've always
been wondering okay I don't want to wear
a bandeau I just want my back to be open
but I don't wanna wear a bra so but like
I have to wear Crocs I'm one of those
people who feels very uncomfortable if
I'm not wearing that so I figured this
is perfect i can wear this just as an
actual shirt it already has the cups
included in it and it's fitted and
everything so i got this as to where is
an actual shirt but it is from their
athletic department let me know if you
guys would wear this to work out maybe
it's just me I don't know high neck to
work out not feeling it the next door it
was brandy melville and we do not have
brandy melville over here in North
Carolina so west coast you guys are very
lucky because you have brandy melville
and North up North has brandy melville
too so they're left with you but I do
not shop at brandy melville because we
don't have it and I just never online
shop as often as I used to so I was very
happy when in San Francisco they had
brandy melville um I went to look marina
County I think or marina district so if
any hope you guys are from there you
guys some really cool stores too i
really loved it there so first thing I
got this is just white t-shirt dress it
has no shape to it it's just thick
cotton or I'm not sure
cotton but it's just a big white dress
the next thing I got from brandy
melville is this plain t-shirt it's just
a plain blight blue-ish gray t-shirt and
it's just very loose I just wanted a
plain shirt just to wear with jeans or
shorts or just for everyday use and it's
extremely soft you guys I really like
the material they use because it feels
like just like a lounge pillow or
something like that the next thing I got
your brandy melville I was very excited
about it is a plaid dress so here it is
it's just I think it's just like a huge
oversized shirt bad now whereas a dress
because it's really oversized so it's
brown and maybe blue plaid and it's very
long and I'm just gonna wear this with
combat boots and I can't wait for fall
actually I can't wait for fall because I
am enjoying my summer and I did not want
to leave for college guys I know I said
I was excited I'm not excited anymore
I'm very sad to leave everyone and my
family and home so I'm not excited for
college I know once I get there I'll be
fine but like right now I just want to
stay right here I'm perfectly fine right
here but i do like fall clothes I don't
want it to be cold but i really want to
wear this so it's very it's very hard to
like decide like which way you head in
my heart or feeling two different things
right now so yeah we like to dress them
and last thing i got and brandy melville
is this shirt that says killing it and
let i'm just going to pause right here
and think about the very first thing
that comes into your head when you hear
killing it
okay for me the very first thing that
pops into my head when I hear that is
Lord's song I think it's tennis courts
it's like okay so we also went to the
Fisherman's Wharf I think that's what
it's called and they have a bunch of
stores in the event or not stores but a
little bunch of like vendors on the
streets so we got a typical tourist
California shirt this one actually came
free my sister my little sister Chloe
which if you guys haven't seen the
sister tag watch it watch it watch it I
will commit right here so if you guys
want to watch it just you know click
right here if you guys would watch it so
we got or Milo sister Khloe she got a
truck rug so yes she got if he has a no
to draw a girl gets look it up it's like
a big like a big not soft at all jacket
thing I don't even know how to describe
it she got her those in an IO sweatshirt
which I will show you in a little bit so
they gave us a free t-shirt and so I
just decide to get this plain black
t-shirt I don't really like the way t
shirts fit so i think i'm going to cut
it up and make it really cool and I
really like the design on it so they'll
end up being super cute once I headed
the sweatshirt though that I got from
that vendor place is this sweatshirt it
says California Republic on it and it
has the bear and it is just a red kind
of cropped sweatshirt and I just thought
it'd be cute for just kind of lazy days
in so a San Francisco if you guys don't
know has a huge or not huge outlet huge
nike store and so we checked that out
because my family is big nike fans
specifically my little brother and my
dad and my um i lo sister they all love
nike and like we always like 92 but
we're just not athletic like me my order
stirred my mom aren't the most athletic
people like the rest of them so i just
got just not sure i thought this would
be good to wear in college when I don't
feel like dressing up and I just want to
wear a sweatshirt
so I just got this plain black
sweatshirt that says nike on it so in
next door was urban outfitters and I did
not get much from Urban Outfitters I
just got this shirt right over here it's
just a plain brown shirt for the same
reason I got the plain blue shirt from
but brandy melville I just wanted a
plaid shirt to wear with jeans because I
feel like I'm gonna be wearing that a
lot lately jeans and just plain t-shirts
because and then just accessorize but
for brandy melville I forgot to include
I got this band oh it's just plain black
and I always I follow them on Instagram
and I see these all the time the chain
or the Caged bandos so I figured it was
about time to buy one for myself and i
have already worn it I love it I do not
like the way it fits though the front is
very loose baggy like I don't like it at
all but the back it fits me on the back
and that's all that matters so yeah I
hopped on that burning that brandy
melville cage bandeau bandwagon at
nordstrom I just got a plane like new
dish pink color tank top it was only
nine dollars and I felt like one of
these just plain tank tops is always
good to wear as an undershirt for things
that are kind of see-through so yeah I
picked one of those up okay and then
another thing that I got is this I saw
it on a hanger it was at a store called
area it's only in three places it's in
Marina del Rey um Santa Barbara and I
so but I got this I think maybe Malibu
maybe I'm not sure so I have this plain
white shirt it's just lace and crochet
and i did not i am kind of tired of the
completely see-through man only Banda
wearing trend like I had my fun of that
trust me that is all I wore for the
longest time but yeah so I had my fun
with that so I decide to be an
undershirt so i got this is on the
hanger together it's black so i think
they'll be cool like white satyr with
black underneath cool contrast um we're
actually the store is called angle angle
or area i'm not quite sure but it looks
like this it's velvet right here and
then see through in a lace at the bottom
so it's a really cool top it's not a
tank top like it's still cropped
obviously but it's not just like a
bandeau so yeah that is all I got in
California and I also actually got the
shirt that I'm wearing this shirt i
think i got at that same store area or
angle whatever it's called and this is
what it looks like so it's cropped as
you can tell it just ends right here i'm
wearing it with a maxi gem skirt it's
tied i am really flowy i really like it
i hope you guys love this hall let me
