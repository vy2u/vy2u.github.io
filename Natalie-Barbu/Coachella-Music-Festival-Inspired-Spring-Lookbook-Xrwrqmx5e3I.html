coming to you with a Coachella / music
festival inspired outfit video and I
decide to do this just because it is my
goal in life or not my goal in life but
it is one of my deep wishes to go to a
music festival one day and I was
actually going to go to the firefly
music festival in Delaware this year but
my parents didn't let me go so I didn't
do that this year but I hope to go to
one someday and I just really like music
a lot I listen to a lot of music I
always have music playing um I'm really
into like all those like cool bands i
would not consider myself a hipster it's
not like I take pride in finding a band
first but if I like their music I'm
gonna listen to it and I'm not one of
those people it's like well I heard it
first it's like good for you I like it
too but anyways this is just say
Coachella inspired music or control
inspired outfits and if you guys aren't
going to a music festival you can still
watch this video because i'm not going
to a music festival and i'm still gonna
wear all these outfits on my spring
break so trust me guys like this is not
just if you're going to a music festival
this is just kind of inspired by it but
you can wear any day of the summer this
is pretty much what i'll be packing for
spring break so it's kind of also like
musical inspired by my spring break
outfits so if you guys just want to see
that then keep watching this video and
let me know is how that's your favorite
so yeah I hope you guys enjoy this video
and make sure to follow me on instagram
and twitter to kind of keep up with me
it is at Natalie underscore Barbu
everything will be in the downbar below
and all the outfits I got bought like
fairly recently at least most of them so
you can still buy them in stores if you
want to so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and I hope you guys have a
great spring and summer I'll talk to you
guys later bye
so this first outfit is very bohemian
kind of hippie style I had slowly pants
a cropped tank top I really like this
tank top just because it's kind of like
see-through at the bottom i have my
elephant bracelet on and then some
jewelry that i just got at honduras and
i went and then my flowy pants which i
love they still sell up forever 21 so if
any of you guys want to go get them you
can the second alpha is probably my
favorite though it's definitely
something I would wear just on an
everyday basis it's just very flowy
shorts and a cropped shirt and I'm
wearing a bandeau under it he said is
see-through and then I had just paired a
summer scarf with it to kind of add as
an accessory because you guys know I
don't really wear a lot of accessories
there's me dancing and looking awkward
but anyways my scarf is from nordstrom
actually and my shirt is from hollister
i believe you guys will see all that i
put it on the screen I just put my hair
up in a bun just because I thought it
looked really cute with this and since
I'm wearing a scarf I kind of wanted to
pull my hair up just to kind of give
attention to the scarf and then my
shorts are from forever 21 and I just
got them recently too so you guys can go
and pick those up as well if you want
and I just love them because they are so
flowy and like you they're pretty much
honestly like you're wearing underwear
but a society doesn't look like you're
wearing underwear and then my shoes are
Sam Edelman and they just have the
fringe at the bottom which i think is
very festival inspired and then this
next outfit is another one of my
favorites it's very flowy dress that I
just recently got at urban outfitters
and I love how the fit of it it's kind
of tight at the top and flows out at the
bottom and then it just says the ruffles
in the back I'm kind of suit through in
the bass like at the very top a little
bit and then yes as I said this is my
new favorite summer hairdo the to
fishtail braids I'm going to be wearing
this a lot lately I really like these
braids I think they're very cute and
they just good kind of an innocent look
to it my bracelet is from american eagle
and i love this bracelet just because
it's reminding me of like hip eNOS I
don't even know it I don't know how to
describe things as you guys can tell but
yeah and then I'm just writing sandals
with it to keep give it kind of a casual
vibe so that you can just
where if you're at a festival or if
you're just walking around town on this
summer this next outfit is straight from
the seven days my friend it is high
waisted jean flared jeans and then a
button up that I tied to kind of expose
my belly just because I thought that if
it's the summer I feel like it's okay to
kind of show a little bit of your belly
as long as it's not too much and I feel
like it's a nice balance is kind of high
waisted and then just a little bit of a
sliver showing and this is also my foods
been working out in this summer I want
to show your toned abs I have been
working out lately only for like two
weeks so it's not really like it hasn't
really shown anything but I don't know I
feel like if you've been working out
it's a good way to kind of show your
improvement because it shows your toned
areas and there's me dancing like being
crazy whatever and yeah so for my hair I
just kind of did it blown out i went to
a hair salon like before I film this
outfit and I got it blown out for prom
just kind of to test it out but I don't
think this is how I'm gonna wear my hair
for prom I think my mom's gonna do it
but anyways the shirt is from madewell
and it's just a regular button up or
button down and I just tied it up just
to kind of make it my own and then I
really like the design on it it kind of
has some dots but they're lifted its
textured my jeans I from american eagle
and they're they're high-waisted artist
flare jeans if any of you guys were
wondering I don't know if they still
sell them but I know I bought them like
at the beginning of the year i believe
and I'd sure like them because they fit
you really nicely and they kind of show
off your curves even though I don't
really have curves they kind of make the
illusion that I do so that's why I like
them a lot and yeah I just thought this
alpha was very 70s inspired and I felt
kind of like a true like 70s person
wearing them and my shoes are the
platforms that I wore in the very first
outfit and I got the network show so
yeah thank you guys so much for watching
and make sure you guys follow me on
instagram and twitter at Natalie
