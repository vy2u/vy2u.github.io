of like college related videos
definitely like my favorite videos to
film this one is a college makeup
tutorial so this is just what I would
wear like on a weekend or on a day out
or when I'm not like not like class
makeup but like sometime like I'm going
out with my friends or going out to
lunch or something like that this is
what I would do so that is actually my
plan for today so it was perfect so I
just got ready on camera for you guys
I'm gonna be showing you guys hair
makeup and outfits and this video is
sponsored by movements watches and
sunglasses so I just want to give a big
shout out to them and thank you to them
because the watches and sunglasses that
they sell on their site are seriously so
freakin cute this is not my first video
I have done with them I really really am
a fan of the watches and sunglasses and
they are designer quality but not
designer prices so for being a college
student especially that's really really
important to me because I mean I can't
afford that so let's be real what I'm
try to look cute and like all out and
stuff and everyone on the internet has
like their Gucci belt and everything I
have this and I did not break the bank
so I consider that a win if you guys
want to get $15 off at your purchase of
any watches and sunglasses or
specifically the ones that I show in
this video plus free shipping then click
the link down below yeah I really hope
that you guys enjoyed this video thank
you guys so much for watching and let's
get into the video
so to start with a fresh clean
moisturized face I am going to apply my
foundation primer this is just to make
sure that it lasts all day long and it
makes my skin feel super soft and then
I'm going in with this L'Oreal Lumi
--gel ocean it's one of their new
products and I am obsessed with it it is
such a great product and eight awesome
dupe for the Mac strobe cream honestly
not gonna lie I think I actually like it
a little better and then I'm going in
with my Fenty foundation and this is
just one of my full coverage or fuller
coverage ones so if I'm going out for a
night I definitely want to have full
coverage foundation and the Fenty one is
just my favorite one that I own
and after foundation I'm gonna apply my
favorite concealer this is my Laura
Mercier one I am looking for another one
though so if you guys have any
recommendations please let me know I
just apply it underneath my eyes and I
just feel like I want a more bright one
because this one like does the job but I
would like to have one that's a little
bit more brightening so just give me
recommendations but yeah I just blend it
out with my finger and then I blend it
out you got a more with a Beauty Blender
and then I just set my under eye
concealer with my Laura Mercier powder
and yeah that's just to avoid creases
because I have realized if I don't set
this one it does crease and then I'm
going in with my fenty by Rihanna
bronzer so this is the stick it comes in
a set of three but this is like the only
one I use and I just applied that on my
cheekbones and on my temples and any way
that you would apply bronzer and I just
blend blend blend today I wanted to do
my nose too so I just added a little bit
of that
and after I blended out my contour I go
in with my Marc Jacobs dewdrops these
smells so good and they are so pigmented
so I definitely recommend them
I put barely a tiny dot on my cheekbones
and blend away because a little goes
such a long way for this and then I also
apply it on my nose to give myself that
little cute little button nose and then
I go on to my eyebrows so I use my
Anasazi eyebrow powder I've been really
into brow powder lately instead of the
stick so that's just what I've been
doing and I just fill them in as usual
and now moving on to eyes I'm just gonna
set my eyes with an eye primer this is
just gonna make sure my eyeshadow lasts
forever and you guys can't tell I knew
Li got my lash extensions I think I'm on
my third week already so that's why my
eyes just look super long but I'm using
this desert vibes palette by EB Beauty
or IB why I don't know how to pronounce
it but I'm just starting off with
blending an orange color into my crease
it's kind of like an orange burnt orange
I guess colored this but this eyeshadow
palette is so great for Coachella so I
cannot wait to wear it but I always
start off by blending a base color on my
crease and then since I'm looking for a
more dramatic look I'm applying a dark
brown a shimmery color onto my lid and
this just meant brightens up or not
brightens up it makes it a lot more like
sultry so the opposite of brightens up
but that's the look I was going for so I
really really like having a dark color
on the lid I think it makes you look so
much more mysterious I'm trying to
smokey eye and then I apply a dark brown
color into my crease and I tried to
apply it just on the outer and edges of
it and blend it into what I already had
blended into the crease you guys can see
what I'm doing this is pretty much like
what I do on every makeup tutorial I'm
gonna go back with the original color
and I make sure everything is blended
and there's no harsh lines and just that
it honestly all looks good together
blended nice and perfectly and next I'm
going in with my Kat Von D tattoo liner
this one is my favorite eyeliner in the
world I'm never gonna get another one
even quote me on it and then I'm just
lining and winging out my upper lash
line
next I'm lining my lower lash line which
is a brown eyeliner this one was so tiny
and I think I'm the most unattractive
person when I'm putting on my eyeliner
let's hide like keep my mouth open the
entire time but yeah that's it for like
the face and then I go on to the lips
but you can't forget the lips
ladies and gentlemen so I'm lining my
lips with this Urban Decay natural lip
liner I don't remember the color but
it's a very natural subtle one and then
I'm using the Sephora collections
lipstick and I'm going in with my fenty
Beauty lip gloss just to add a little
more of a pop and that is it's for
asked for hair I'm just gonna curl it so
this is the process that I do when I
curl I separate it into three sections
so I'm doing the bottom section right
now and I have a wand this is I believe
a one-inch wand and I just curl it in
separate directions and then I leave
about an inch at the bottom so that it
looks a little more beachy and then once
I'm done with that I take another
section and I leave a tiny section at
the top this is super super
self-explanatory but I've actually never
shown this on camera so I wanted to show
you guys and then again I do the last
layer and I just like run my fingers
through it to make it look a lot more
messy and natural
