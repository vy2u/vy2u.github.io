I am filming a very different video on
my channel it's something I've never
done before and something I've actually
never seen because pretty embarrassing
like I don't know why I'm doing this but
I think you'll be funny
so I am letting my dad take over my
tinder account which is so weird to me
because well one that's just weird for
anyone you guys probably watching your
life line the world would you ever do
that but I thought it was a funny video
idea this video is also inspired by why
ham which is a movie that just came out
on blu-ray DVD so be sure to pick that
up at your local Walmart Target wherever
they sell DVDs make sure to pick it up
it's a movie about a girl who brings her
boyfriend home for the holidays and her
dad basically hates him because he's
like just like wild and definitely not
someone that you want your daughter to
be dating so this movie this video is
inspired by that so please go pick it up
at any place when you guys find DVDs I
think it's a movie is hilarious I've
seen it I think it's so so funny so if
you guys haven't seen it and what you be
sure to do that and if you have let me
know if you guys liked it or what you
guys thought of the movie down below and
not further ado hi everyone so this is
my dad Sam to tell about the do retired
or good my dad low so he's never even
done a couple of blogs never like
actually been in a video with me before
so I told him or anytime what we were
doing so we read about an inspiration
about that movie why him
inspired by this guy he's 25 he's a
director of sales mmm

wasting all these like language look at
it astronaut or nothing
come on no super fan well no shall we do
like them there was going to be a no but
that was that if you could describe
someone's good that you would have said
yes to just based off of profile what
would it be somebody that a student had
reasonably good university that it looks
fairly clean
if it has sports interests and fears
about that chosen before disciplines and
a guy that has a comes from love
probably solid family what can you tell
in the throat well they come from a
sauce that kind of are you kid
