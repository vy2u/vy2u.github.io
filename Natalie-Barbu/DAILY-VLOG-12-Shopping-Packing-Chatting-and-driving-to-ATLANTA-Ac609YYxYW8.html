free people dress cuz you know free
people and anthropology or the same
company and then I am wearing a big
cardigan I don't know what it's from but
it's super fuzzy and I figured it might
be a little chilly now it's dark outside
and like you can't see anything let me
see if I like ah that's so much better
um and then like this purple dress it's
super cute this big cardigan and then I
think I'm gonna wear those sandals over
there with this but yeah tell me what

it's literally a giant on it um see if I
can undo this giant knot it's like
literally a not like I'm trying to undo
a not a big knot was like ah okay two
hair ties in you know what I honestly
might just lean it up kind of like it up
like a high ponytail well I gotta fix it
but I suck at buttons like I cannot do a
bun I'm gonna try one more time at about
and if it doesn't work then ponytail it
is oh my god just drop me though
so we are at Nordstrom now and I'm just
shopping around in the free people
section my favorite realize I need to
apply don't Nordstrom online but yeah I

hall hey guys so it is the next morning
I am trying to include a school I'm not
looking at the camera because I'm
driving yeah yeah Chloe it's just so
yeah it's like 8:20 in the morning so
it's gonna relief or break
yeah I have a lot of stuff to do today
so early but Chloe's wearing a really
cute outfit so I wanted her to show you
guys what it was so there you go Chloe
you can hold the camera and she's eating
mini pancakes and they smell really good
so I'm wearing a flowy dress from I
think I want to say Nordstrom PPE and
the sleeves I have a cartoon over this
from Abercrombie because dress code but
the sleeves because I can
off-the-shoulder
its long sleeve then it just comes with
a little strap here then for my shoes
hey guys so I'm getting ready to work
out today I kind of just want to guys
what I was wearing to work out um and I
really don't want to work out at all but
I figured if I put myself in workout
clothes maybe they'll like motivate me
to work out I guess kind of did
I'm just really the only reason I'm
working out because I haven't worked out
forever and I really want a smoothie
after this and I decided if I don't
worry about I don't get a smoothie so
I'm gonna work out and tips for
beginners working out kind of random I
would say that you guys should even if I
do Blogilates so I'll like show you what
that is right now
Julie cool she's a youtuber too so
that's pretty cool um I'm on front
camera so I got to do this but it's like
this she gives you a calendar so today
I'm gonna be doing like April 2nd
calendar and then like all her videos
are on YouTube essentially cool um and
I'm just gonna do that but if you guys
can't keep up with her I would suggest
doing the beginner's calendar because
that's what I did and it really helped
me get into the routine and then it they
weren't as hard to do all of them when I
got to the her normal calendars but yeah
if you really can't do all of them don't
I still don't sometimes honestly I
probably won't this time but yeah so I'm
getting ready to work out
