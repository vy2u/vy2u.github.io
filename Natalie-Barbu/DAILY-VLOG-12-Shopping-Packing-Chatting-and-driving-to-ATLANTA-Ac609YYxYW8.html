I'd be like holding it about driving all
right hey guys so I am getting ready to
workout today I kind of just want two
guys what I was wearing to work out um
and I really don't want to work out at
all but i figured if i put myself in
workout clothes maybe they'll like
motivate me to work out hi I guess kind
of did I'm just really the only reason
I'm working out because I am working on
forever and um I really want a smoothie
after this and I decided if I don't work
out I don't get a smoothie so I'm gonna
work out and tips for beginners working
out kind of random um I would say that
you guys should even if I do Blogilates
so I'll like show you what that is right
now Julie cool um she's a youtuber too
so that's pretty cool um I'm on front
camera so I got to do this but it's like
this she gives you a calendar such a
maybe doing like April 2nd calendar and
then like all her videos are on YouTube
that's really cool um and just gonna do
that but if you guys can't keep up with
her I would suggest doing the beginners
calendar because that's what I did and
it really helped me get into the routine
and then um it they weren't as hard to
do all of them when I got to the heart
normal calendars but yeah if you really
can't do all them don't I still don't
sometimes honestly I probably won't this
time but yeah so I'm getting ready to
work out hey guys so I'm showing a black
sports bra um some blue running shorts
and no shoes right now sometimes a lot
of our videos don't need shoes because
it's Pilates but yeah working on that
summer bod
