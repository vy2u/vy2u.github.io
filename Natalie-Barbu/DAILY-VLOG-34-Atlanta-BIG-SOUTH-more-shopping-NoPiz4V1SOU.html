go to another mall in the only went to
yesterday I don't know if I I don't

a Phipps Plaza yesterday and I didn't
really like it that much personally I
thought it was too like the stores were
too I don't know I just there to upscale
the stores like not realistic to shop at
so we're gonna go to lenox square mall
um I feel like that's like a pretty
popular mall I've been there before um
but i just want to show you guys what I
was wearing today so I'm wearing this
shirt from american eagle and it looks
like it's rum brandy melville and it's
one size fits all like brandy melville
and actually it's not one size but it's
like the soft material like brandy like
the same like look of it and then i have
the same green army jacket tied around
my waist and i'm wearing these boyfriend
jeans from gap they are my sister
they don't really fit me but it's for a
reason I only brought clothes for Miami

get some stuff but i don't really like
anything in here yeah just shopping
around everything's expensive and I
so still shopping around and I'm in
urban outfitter we at this time

awkward and I don't really like doing it
but then just like when am I ever gonna
see you again and if you guys watched on
YouTube videos then you guys won't judge
me so yeah I'm just shopping around and
finding nothing I was hoping I could
film the hall for you guys after this
trip but I literally bought one thing so
