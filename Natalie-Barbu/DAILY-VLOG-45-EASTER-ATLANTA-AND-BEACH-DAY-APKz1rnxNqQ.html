like it's just like you are in the
middle of the state awesome I'm like no
one ever wants to be the middle of
something I just thought the name of the
college was funny yeah so hopefully

decided I'll miss one day it's not gonna
be the end of the world I just had a
test in calculus so it's not like it
will be that important you know I could
catch up really easily and physics

from someone that's really fine so but
yeah in physics today we are learning
about pressure and I'm taking notes
online about it so yeah I'm taking these
notes on like fluids and stuff like that

only has three sides but yep so if you
guys are in physics I feel your pain if
you guys are good at physics
