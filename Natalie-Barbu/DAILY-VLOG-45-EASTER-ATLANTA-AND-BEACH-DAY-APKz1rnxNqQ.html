a bad school or anything cuz i've never

it's funny cuz like middle Georgia
doesn't really sound appealing you know
like it's just like you are in the
middle of the state awesome i'm like no
one ever wants to be the middle of
something i I just thought the name of
the college was funny yeah so hopefully
these vlogs are entertaining to you guys

still in Georgia so we're not even in
florida yet we're going all the way down
to Miami um but yeah I got a cheese
danish which I love and I wanted H
butter croissant because they were less
calories but they didn't have any so I
guess I had to get the cheese danish um
and then I got a iced vanilla latte with
light ice in it and me and my mom are
just watching parks and rec the whole
time I'm just like setting it up almost
um unlike the screen like I'm just like
propping my phone up on here you don't

we get there maybe but yeah anyways
that's about it pretty boring uneventful
guys so it is the next morning and we
are finally in Miami we got back at 2am
last night so later than expected it was
very tired and angry so tangri I guess I
was really pissed off last night I think
I was just really tired and I just I
don't know it's getting mad at everyone
everything and I don't do well when I'm
tired I guess so but um yeah so we're
here miami finally it is 11 a.m. and i
finished editing the first half of the
vlog which it literally takes five
minutes to edit cuz i just put the clip

mall probably go to eat so yeah maybe
this blog will be more entertaining all

of the world I just had a test in
calculus so it's not like it will be
that important you know I can catch up
really easily and physics I just just
really don't like that glass and then
