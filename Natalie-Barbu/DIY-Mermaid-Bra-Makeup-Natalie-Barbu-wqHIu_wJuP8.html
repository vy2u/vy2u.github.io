I am filming a Halloween look and I know
this is super last-minute but it is the
one I'm doing tomorrow so I decided to
practice first and decide to show you
guys so if you guys can't tell what I'm
being I am being a mermaid and I have
always want to be a mermaid like for
Halloween for like the past few years
but never really knew like what to wear
cuz I didn't just want to wear like just
like bra and skirt and stuff like that
and I didn't want to wear a long skirt
or anything so I decided to make my own
mermaid bra this year and I showed you
guys how to make it and it's really
really cute it is like a piece of art
and the fact that I'm wearing it to like
some gross college party kind of makes
me upset because I don't know I feel
like I'm just gonna get a dirty and
stuff and like things are gonna fall off
of it and I'm not gonna have it anymore
so yeah maybe I should like make a
collection of these and just make
mermaid bras for a living
sell them on Etsy what any of you guys
buy them so I decide to do this look for
you guys it's super easy I definitely
did it on a whim like if you guys can't
tell when you're watching the video I
didn't know what I was doing I was just
kind of throwing glitter on my face and
hoping for the best so that's basically
what I did and hope you guys will like
it if you guys are new here be sure to
subscribe I post videos every Tuesday
and Friday so hit that subscribe button
and follow me on all my social media so
you can see what I'm actually doing on
Halloween so you can see pictures and
yeah just like my actual life so some of
the things fell off on the bra because
when I put it on a me and my roommate
got really up close and personal she was
like basically by tugging this bra down
on me because it doesn't have a clasp so
that was fun
thanks for like really pulling it out on
me though that's a little awkward it's
it's fun and it's just roommate things
yeah so I hope that you guys enjoy this
video what this is definitely by far my
favorite look I'm absolutely obsessed
and I think that's it I think yeah so
let's get into it so first I already
started out with foundation and
concealer if you guys want to see how I
do that please watch my everyday makeup
routine but then I just go straight into
contouring so I want to do kind of a
dramatic contour and so I'm just putting
bronzer with an angled brush on my
cheekbones and I'm not really blending
it out that much and then I'm also gonna
contour my nose I just think
this makes the mermaid look look just a
little bit better and more defined and
then I'm going in with a super super
shimmery golden highlight which actually
is loose powder and I am dramatically
putting that on my highlight you
definitely want to put more highlight
than you normally would this is a very
normal color but it's definitely gonna
be used for our base and to blend all of
the lavender and turquoise colors and
then I'm also putting some on my nose
and my temple now I'm going in with a
liquid eyeshadow and or a cream
eyeshadow and a purple color it's more
like a lavender and I'm applying that
where I applied my highlight but
starting it a little bit higher and then
I'm blending it all throughout my
forehead up until about the middle of it
so I'm just blending it with my finger
your finger definitely works best and
I'm only doing it on one side of my face
and the other side I'm doing just a
little bit so I'm not gonna blend it on
the other side as high up because I
think that would be way too much and you
would just look like a giant grease ball
and then I'm putting whatever I have
leftover on my nose
then I'm going in with a blue thick
eyeliner I think it's just a I shadow
stick and I am putting X's in and then
on my forehead and blending it out
so the X's just make it better so that
you can blend out and that's how you
kind of get the gradient effect and then
I'm going in with a loose shadow that's
a silver purple color and I'm blending
that basically everywhere where I
applied all the other colors and then
I'm going in with a Mac pigment and this
is a purple metallic color but it is a
darker purple and I went flying that was
an eye shadow brush and just patting it
on I thought this made it look more like
fins or scales just a little bit more
dimensional so I'm patting it on and I'm
actually not blending that then I'm
going in with my highlight color and
this is another highlight it's actually
a purple highlight so this is an honest
hacia glow kit and I'm putting that
below all of the colors and then I'm
putting in a shimmery highlight on the
bridge of my nose and on my key bits of
O then I'm applying a lip gloss I
decided a pink lip gloss and went in
with that purple shimmery color
and I'm applying that on my lips now for
the eyes I made my eyebrows be a little
bit more dramatic than I normally do
because everything is so shimmery and
glowy you don't want to just look like a
greaseball I know I've said that before
but you want to make your eyebrows stand
out and make them as matte as possible
so there is some matte on your face and
there's not all shininess everywhere I
forgot to prime my eyes but you would
have to prime your eyes and then I'm
applying the bronzer that I put on onto
my crease and this is just again gonna
make things more matte and not
everything to be shimmery then I'm
taking that blue shadow stick again and
putting that on my lower lash line in a
thicker so a little bit thicker than I
would I would normally do and I'm going
in with a purple eyeliner from Urban
Decay
and I'm applying that halfway on to make
it look like a gradient effect it looks
really really pretty and these are like
the perfect mermaid colors they just
look great and it just looks like ombre
then we're going in with a white shadow
stick this is from NYX and I'm putting
that on my inner tear duct and I'm
blending that out and blending it kind
of onto my lid too I'm just doing this
until I receive the desired whiteness
and brightness effect that I want just
makes your eyes brighter then I'm going
in with a gold eyeshadow and I'm
applying that all over my lid applying
it all over my lid and underneath my
brow bone again just to kind of define
your eyebrows a little bit more but then
I realized that I put way too much gold
so I went back in with my bronzer to
kind of make it a little bit more matte
again not too too shimmery and put that
on my crease then I'm doing a liquid
eyeliner so I wanted a very bold eye
because everything is so glittery I just
kind of wanted something dark to really
really stand out and I was kind of going
for a more fish eye effect so how some
fishes have like a like very black eyes
I don't know that's the vision I was
going for and then with the gold eye
shadow or gold eyeliner I outlined the
wing of the eyeliner so if that makes
sense I just outlined the wing of it
like you can see here and it just made
it look more like a fish I don't know if
that makes sense to you guys but that's
what I was going for in my head and I
really like it then I connected the very
outer corner of my eye with black
eyeliner and just to make it kind of
look a little bit more connected and not
just like you just have a huge wing and
a bunch of colors then last step you go
you know with mascara and you are done
with your makeup look but you cannot
forget the jewels so I got these crafts
from Michaels and they're actually
stickers and that is what I put on my
bra as you will see and I just put those
all over where my highlight was on that
side and I just did some big ones some
little ones just mixed it up you can
tell what you like but you got to give
the other side a little bit of love
because we've kind of been neglecting it
the whole time so I just added a couple
there just to make it look more even and
I'm obsessed with how it turned out I
think it looks so good and I just am
obsessed with this makeup look
now for the bra you're going to need a
bra preferably a colorful one that you
like some shells some beads and pearls
and now you're just gonna lay it all out
and I decided to produce big shells on
the top corner kind of the outer corner
so this is completely up to you totally
customizable I feel like I can't really
give you too many tips but I just hot
glue to everything and I hot-glued the
shells all around the edges of the
shells to make sure that if any part
stuck to the fabric it wouldn't fall off
and I lifted up the bra periodically to
make sure that the shells weren't
falling off and then I outlined the bra
which is the same part with pearls this
I think makes it look really really
pretty and I feel like it's just a nice
touch and then I also outlined the
bottom of my bra because my bra has
extra lace at the bottom as you can see
with pearls and then I also did some
jewels and I spaced these big silver
ones out because I didn't want them all
together cuz one I don't think I had
enough of them and two I just didn't
thought it would look a little bit too
much so then I also put pearls on top
kind of made it like a line and a row of
pearls and then I just added some of the
more like thicker sea shells all in the
middle of the bra so I thought that this
gave it a nice variety I put some little
ones big ones just wherever I saw fit
and then the extra jewels that I had I
put it in all of the empty spaces I
really tried filling up the bra I also
mixed and matched with pearls the bronze
jewels the silver ones you just really
can customize this as much as you want I
thought it turned out great but yeah you
just customize it put whatever you want
wherever you want and then I also put
some jewels kind of in between the big
silver ones and some pearls just because
I thought that it looked a little bit
better and I needed to fill the space
even though the bra was a pretty color
so I didn't mind if some of it peeked
through I just thought it looked better
like that now I'm going in with starfish
and these from Michaels actually smelled
like the ocean and they smell so so bad
like I honestly thought these were alive
starfish like they were it was the worst
smelling thing I had to Febreze them so
much but I hot-glued
those on that row and I thought that
looks so pretty and then you get the
gist of it I put jewels in between where
there was fabric showing and
then I thought that it would be really
cute to put the seashells on the top
kind of where the straps work and add
some jewels where the fabric was showing
so that is the pattern of the bra it is
so cute I love it
and then I just put fish netting around
the back of the bra just to kind of do
something to it but that one it was like
that's so optional I just did it just I
don't know have something
