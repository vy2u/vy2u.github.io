okay I've never done one of these before
but I hope the lighting in here in some
awful it's about to get better we're
gonna go outside I am going to be
filming a drive with me video today so
that is what this is you guys guessed it
and I have never filmed one of these
before but you really wanted to fill in
line because I love watching them I
think they're so fun and I wanted to
show you guys my favorites music of the
month and also just talk to you because
I literally love talking to you guys
like I'd like what I vlog I talk to you
a lot so I love that so shout out to my
blog channel shout out to my Instagram
too if you just feel like following me
on everything books turn on the music
and I my handy-dandy bluetooth aux board
because my car doesn't have a knock or
it only has an aux it doesn't have
bluetooth so I have a bluetooth on my
own sport it's really really smart
highly recommend got it off Amazon I
just got a notification that it's HQ
time so if you guys don't play HQ trivia
use my code to get a free life or to
give me a free life because then we
really love that game I want to win one
time let me know if you've got guys I've
ever won and I'm just gonna hit shuffle
okay mo soda try not to die while they
get out of this parking deck because
it's literally like people go like 50
miles per hour in here it literally
takes me like ten minutes to get out of
this parking garage oh there's a speeder
I wish you guys could see my view
because they just fly around the corner
oh I love the trucks you guys are from
the south do you guys love trucks no
sarcasm for me yay we're outside we
finally made it out of my you know a
parking deck
I know if you guys like drive with me
videos because I honestly only like two
minutes in but we're off to a good start
I also need gas so that's why we're just
gonna go to Starbucks cuz I don't want
to get gas right now
I don't know the words it's sad because
I literally speak Spanish I just like
haven't had the time to learn the words
to this song
I don't really really want to fight
anymore
I don't really really want to fake it no
more
when people do drive with means they're
not actually singing but like I can't
not saying like I have to say like I
can't just lip-synch I have to actually
be singing anyways
also I want feedback from you guys on at
my channel and what videos to you guys
like seeing because I know you guys love
college weekend my life's but I'm trying
to balance that with like vlogging daily
so if you guys don't know I have a vlog
channel like I mentioned earlier and I
am doing like daily vlog so I'm like
vlogging a little bit every day but like
the upload could be like four days in a
row or in one blog one day and one log
two days in one blog like I don't really
have a schedule so let me know if you
guys want me to still do like college
week in my life on this channel like and
then just not vlog for a week on my vlog
channel or if you guys just like mommy
to my channel also I want to let you
guys know I have gone vegan so
plant-based mainly so I picked up a book
called the Whole Foods diet highly
highly highly recommend I'm not even
halfway through but it's so good and
it's all of so much information that is
so important so basically having a
plant-based diet 90% of the time is the
healthiest way to live in terms of
reversing like diseases and preventing
heart disease renting cancer like all of
this horrible stuff that plagues
Americans literally and so many other
countries yes they have those things but
not at the rates that America does and I
feel like it is because we are so
focused on fast food of processed food
meat dairy like that is our like main
food groups they've done so many studies
on people that have like had a
plant-based diet and their health
compared to people in the same city the
same area everything that don't have a
plant-based diet and compared to their
health and it's like remarkable the
difference
that is why I want to eat my base 90% of
the time I don't know if I can commit
100% I've been doing a hundred percent
the past it's like two or three days and
it's been easy but it's just gonna be
difficult when I go out to eat but like
when I cook at home and stuff I'm 100%
plant-based so once update you guys on
that because a lot of you guys gave me
such great tips of all in my last ye in
a day this next song is so freakin good
I'm obsessed with Portobello band and I
can't wait to show you so good gosh oh
my gosh geez okay I almost died oh my
gosh I never lay on my horn and someone
literally pulled up in front of me and
complete like they were trying to make a
left and they just like Holt stopped in
front of me and I'm literally exclaiming
very late on my horn oh my gosh that was
not my fault at all I was paying
attention like they were just been an
idiot and didn't see me coming and
decide to turn left and there was a car
right there like she's the car behind me
like tried like veering out of the way
oh wow you guys are getting some action
in this video
okay well that could have been really
bad let's go and enjoy this song because
that was actually really scary not gonna
lie because I was a 100% not my fault
and I was paying attention to the road
they just like completely uh-uh
like guys look both ways before making a
freaking left turn that is so annoying
this is the drive-through Starbucks I
will literally drive like ten minutes
out of my way not even just for this
video this is like my regular Starbucks
because I the closest one to me is on a
drive-thru and the parking sucks so I
literally Drive ten minutes extra to get
to this drive-through Starbucks and the
quickest way to get to this Starbucks is
using the highway but I don't like
driving on the highway if I don't have
to so you spend an extra week five
minutes taking the backroads taking the
scenic routes because I really don't
like the highway I don't know anyone
feel that way oh no I definitely need a
Starbucks okay
I thank you for coming back looking
again for you alright um can I please
get an iced grande coconut milk latte
please with light ice in it
sunday i cook it up laughter yes with my
ice
and that's it
thank you I only order coconut milk now
at Starbucks it's so good and I
literally don't taste a difference and I
stopped ordering vanilla lattes which
pains me to say but I realize if they
are just full of sugar and I don't need
that in my life and it's really not a
big difference for me
whether it's like coconut milk or you
know a lot I'd like now because I've
ordered it for so long like I'm used to
it so the guy the window is gonna be
like hello to the camera
the lady in front is throwing hands I
think she's angry she's literally like
with her hand out the window like
they're pushing hands there drink okay
this is gonna be really awkward when
they come to
thank you
I thought nice one I'm sorry Oh
thank you
he's him I didn't even know he saw you
that is honestly he was like look at me
dead in the eye the entire time I think
I'm gonna go to hold food after this I
want to get some lentil pasta cuz I
really want to make a vegan mac and
cheese see you guys this is how you turn
left you look both ways okay so I really
want to make a vegan mac and cheese but
I want to get some protein in it so I'm
gonna pick up some lentil pasta from
Whole Foods cuz it's so good look at me
when you think
all right if you guys have never had a
relationship like that
be thankful but I feel like definitely
anyone can relate like oh I love that
song that's so much it's so good see
whenever have a coffee like I just feel
so much better it's a lot of fun I like
drive with me and the fan I rate them 10
out of 10 try it yourself okay in an
accident like I almost said that you
know
I feel like I'm like dishing out all the
songs now but it's I just like I'm so
happy when I'm singing it along so this
next song is so good and if you guys
haven't heard it 100% ago attitude
Spotify playlist it's so good
camera stuff because it was to like it
was like recording too long you probably
thought like there's no way this check
is recording for 30 minutes the drive
with me like no oh hey I got a front row
spot okay oh yeah all right I am at home
food so that concludes this drive with
me I had a couple more songs I actually
wanted to put in this video but the
camera told me the video is too long so
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video I absolutely loved filming it and
thank you guys for watching if you made
it this far let me know if you guys have
heard any of those songs and if you like
them or any songs that I should include
in the next Drive with me definitely
think this is gonna be a monthly thing
like for sure because I had so much fun
filming it and it gave me it gave me an
excuse to drink my Starbucks so thank
you guys for coming along with me and
