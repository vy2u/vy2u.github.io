afternoon repeat splash like what I did
today video if that makes sense I don't
really know I I haven't seen too many of
these but it's kind of a follow me
around but so but not like a vlog
I don't know hope you guys like it so
yeah I just split showed yeah it's what
I did Jake obviously every single day
it's different but I suspect in this
video just because I really want to do
try video where I can experiment with my
everything I didn't have as much time as
I wanted to because Chloe needs to tell
me milk and we had about an hour and a
half and it's not a lot different at all
so this video might be a little bit
short but if you stay to the end I have
a giveaway for you guys so make sure
that you watch the end of this video for
my very awesome giveaway and I love love
love news giveaways but yes some of this
stuff if you want more giveaways so
planning on doing another one like and
the summer once I hit 20,000 subscribers
which I believe I met 17,000 right now
once I hit 20,000 I am doing a giveaway
so yeah make sure that you guys
subscribe and I will be doing a giveaway
once again 20k so can't even believe but
70,000 thank you guys so so much for
watching me yeah stay tuned campus video
for that get away but wait for before I
start any day I just go on my computer
and watch youtube videos or I'll go on
Pinterest and I'll just get some DIY
inspiration or just any inspiration just
for life you know Pinterest is all about
that I'm always reading a book and right
now I'm reading you're already amazing
it's a really great book kind of tells
you your self-worth and God instead of
your self-worth in the world which will
make you insecure only thing on my
calendar today it's to film might give
away so that's what I'm basically doing
for my shoes those are from Sam Edelman
they are from Nordstrom and obviously
you gotta have shoes to start your day
and I really really love these staple
little tassels on the side I think
they're just so so cute and yeah I
basically wear them with everything in
the summer I'm not even kidding my dress
is from every fabric calm and it's super
super cute it kind of reminds me of
bohemian like I don't know kind of
reminds me of a beach I guess I feel
like I'm kind of in like tropical
weather even though it's long-sleeve
it's just super flowy and super super
cute I really love the material of it
and just the color is kind of like an
off greyish purple color which I really
like and then I get my keys and my
wallet and I kind of just start my day
and start running any errands I always
have to have music when I'm driving so I
put on my Spotify playlist and I just
jam out while I'm in the car it was such
a nice day nice day out outside so I had
to put the top down because I do have a
convertible so whenever it's nice
outside definitely requires top down
whether there's Chloe she was my little
filmography today so obviously I gotta
get my Starbucks fix for the day I don't
have Starbucks every day but I basically
do it's very very rare when I don't have
it heading off to Michael's just to get
some stuff for my video normally what
are you doing today is I figure out what
video I'm going to feel next and gonna
get everything I need for that next
video so I'm super prepared so as I'm in
Michaels I'm looking at my Pinterest
just to see the things that I need and
I'm just kind of getting them as you can
tell I'm getting a canvas didn't giving
you a sneak peek of what there is in
store if you want to follow my Pinterest
you can you'll probably know what I'm
filming in advance cuz I pinned things
that I'm going to show next when I head
home I really like my outfit today which
I do a lot of days I just sit outside
and take a bunch of pictures of my
outfit or sometimes I'll travel
somewhere and take pictures of my outfit
then I go through delete all the woods
I don't like which come on me we all do
it and then after that and basically
done with my day and I just plop on my
bed and relax all right
you're finished with the video hope you
guys liked it and you guys are probably
still here because of my giveaway I'm
guessing guessing that's what it is well
look at you guys I am giving away a $50
gift card to febri calm and you guys
don't know what febri is it is an online
boutique where I got this beautiful
dress I really really like it
um but yeah if you don't like this dress
no worries because they have a ton of
other things and you are getting a gift
card which means you can get basically
anything you want on it so yeah and the
company was generous to give me a $50
gift card to give to you guys and that
means that there will be two giveaway
it's probably by the end of this month
so that is awesome and incredible and I
interesting very happy if you guys can't
tell so the rules of this giveaway are
on my phone right now and I'm just going
to leave them out loud so the very first
rule is that you need to follow them on
one of their social networks so you can
Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube
anything like that you should need
involvement on one of them I have a link
all men down below so you can pick which
one you want to follow them on doesn't
really matter to me whichever way you
use more you also need to be following
me on Instagram so make sure that you
follow me on Instagram I will link that
down below as well and you also meet you
subscribe to me and give this video a
big thumbs up so subscribe to me and
follow me and give this video thumbs up
3 things that you got to do for me for
this way then also you need a tagline at
every fashion has checked every hashtag
to every fashion on what ups your photos
or on my picture that I'm wearing this
dress to comment back below doesn't
matter to me you just need to tell them
and hashtag it is super super easy then
best part about this is you go online
and all my job and you tell me what your
favorite thing in so that if you want to
get away
I have an idea of what you had together
and kind of like you have your style
don't worry Bolin the $50 gift card says
doesn't matter really what you put in
the comments below but you really you
have to go to their website and tell me
what you like in the comments below
simple of that and that is all you have
to do for this giveaway so I think we

all do that on the regular so yeah make
sure that you can actually do that we do
this you enter and then we see that
you're not doing one of these things

winner will be chosen at random and the
it is only us only unfortunately but my
videos that I will be you need 20,000
subscriber giveaway it is going
international and I'm so excited about
that so to be my first ever
international giveaway so I feel so
awful when I'm right don't do
international giveaways but it is super
expensive for me but I figured it now
once I hit 20,000 that's a big deal and
I should definitely see something funny
with you guys so that's what I'm gonna
be doing and yeah this video so make
sure you give it a thumbs up if you want
to be entering and all the rules will be
listed down below just so that you don't
