breakfast right now about to go to a
workout class so I always start my
mornings working out if you guys watched
my workout week or week of workouts with
me we're gonna go to a hot yoga class
I just found one that has one week free
for LA so it's like a hot bar class I
don't know even if it's hot but it's
like a yoga bar class is what it says
online
pro tip look up free like weekly classes
are first-time free and then whatever
city you're in and you guys will find so
many so you never have to pay for an
actual membership that's how you save
money you guys Sydney and I just got
done with that hot yoga class and I it
was literally the hardest what yoga
class I've ever taken and I have taken
quite a bit of hot yoga classes I love
doing yoga it's like one of my favorite
workouts and that was the hardest class
oh my god it was such a great workout we
burned at 500 Cal or 450 active calories
and 530 non-actor like total calories so
we burned a lot of calories doing that
and it was just like such an amazing
workout we were like dripping sweat you
guys
jumped in a pool yeah it's disgusting
seriously so I just stopped by coffee
bean and T or picked up a sandwich I got
this egg white pepper jack and roasted
pepper sandwich and then I also got a
lot today and I've drank a ton of water
because after you do yoga you need to
drink like more water than usual now
we're gonna go shower and I have an
appointment with the a-list which is
like a showroom but because they're
dressing me for the boo boo party
tonight I gotta get ready because I'm
gonna be like right now I'm about to go
to a fitting just paid my meter for the
car let's put up a fitting at the a-list
and I'm just gonna get dressed for this
boo boo party that I'm going to tonight
so I'm really excited for that let's see
how it is I like show rooms like this so
it should be fine bye so I was in tirage
I missed so many turns like almost died
on my way here so that's nice
got the boohoo stuff whoo I'm excited to
show you guys the outfit I'm gonna wear
tonight I was only in there for like 20
minutes it was really nice they just let
me pick out okay but I just got to pick
out any boo-boo items from the showroom
and they're mine to keep so that's
really really nice I'm definitely
wearing something out of my comfort zone
not gonna lie wearing a super tight
metallic like silver metallic dress if
you guys watch Xena on a girl the 21st
century
you're a real 90s kid and you know what
I'm talking about it looks like it's
straight from Zenon the girl there I
think she was like 18 or maybe she was
like 20 or something like that they were
all super super sweet but she was like I
don't know what Zenon it's like oh my
god my childhood pick that out caught a
white denim jacket from the men's
section and I'm gonna wear some white
beauties to say and I'm gonna look so
like out of my comfort zone but I'm
excited I'm going when Tasha and Nicole
Alexa all the girls and it should be a
fun like night with boo who I guess for
Paris Hilton's launched so that's gonna
be funny because Paris London's
deejaying there since when does she
all right so we are at creation right
now it's a really really cute restaurant
and we're a hydrometer making like a
healthy lunch so it's just really really
good I just got breakfast though again I
don't know I just was craving it
right now I am at alfred's I just got
some coffee and I'm with Brittany and
joseline joseline joseline okay I've
been Britney for a very very long time

YouTube and they're here for VidCon this
is my second coffee of the day but it's
fine
we just are taking like a few pictures I
just want to show them around like West
Hollywood area because it's really cute
Instagram a bowl and I feel like if
you've never been to LA it's like a good
place to first go so I think we're gonna
go around here and then maybe does it
Grove and I'll probably get some press
freeze I've just been like eating all
day so that's just what I'm gonna do but
candy room and I was like - leave my
glossy has this like I mean it's cool
but cool what's the point
branding I'm confused yeah
like night today or something it is this
is kind of weird this would not be a
proper day in my life if I didn't get
press for you
I said fresh breeze dinner I got this
kale her I don't know if it's kale the
pesto pasta to begin random vegan plays
but Brittany never focuses there you go
and then she got the same thing
we are just back at my apartment now and
I just got ready for the boo boo event
so I'm going to that tonight it's like
Paris Hilton's lunch so it's gonna be
really really cool

like 7:30 still so I had to get really
really really really quickly and then
Nicola is meeting me here and then we're
meeting Alexa at the actual place but
yeah this is the look I'll show you guys
in the mirror alright this is the outfit
so I'm wearing a this dress it's silver
feel very futuristic like I told you
guys so really really tight though so
I'm glad that I have this jacket so just
you know cover up but it's still an
accessory thanks guys even then this
jacket it's from the men's section which
I like better cuz it's like oversized
and cool and then these shoes are from
Windsor and I haven't worn them yet but
I'm really excited because I like never
wear these ankle not ankle but like the
ones that cut you off because I always
feel like I look too short but I feel
like this is gonna appropriate yeah
they're like a mini go-go boots I
literally feel like a go-go doll I feel
like I'm going out for Halloween yeah I
look like Halloween I think so we're
going out

boohoo party it was an event for the
Paris Hilton launch so it's Paris Hilton
and boohoo
they created a line together it was like
the launch of that and there were so
many like I like famous people you know

literally everywhere it's so funny vile
Ashley I and Jared were there there was
like CN is that her name I don't know
other people that I didn't know but like
people were telling me that they were
from The Bachelor david dobrik and the
vlog squad was there which I thought was
so cool because if you guys don't know
I'm obsessed with his videos I don't
understand the phenomenon of him but I
love it I just think like it's I don't
know he's just like seems like a very
very cool person and he was there which
was really cool and like talking got a
photo with him which was nice and like
we were just like around each other but
I didn't like go up to him or say
anything and then who else was there
there was just like Paris Hilton

such a fun night I sure I'm missing some
people but yeah we got invited today it

the perfect day to film a day in the
life but I want you guys to know that
