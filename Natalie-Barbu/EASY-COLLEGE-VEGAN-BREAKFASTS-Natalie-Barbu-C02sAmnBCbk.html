and I have a very special guest here
Matilda
hi guys I have a new channel right now
it's called the true foods and so we
wanted to do a cooking type video so we
need to have a different idea and I know
that you guys love when I do like what I
eat in a daze I did I said actually so
many times really the college recipe
video I literally have never gotten
around to do it so this was like the
perfect time because she is all about
cooking healthy cooking too and we were
both college students so we definitely
understand that we need to make like
quick easy meals but am I also not like
junk food so I remember my freshman year
at you know mom on pink drift they have
like all the mug microwave okay yeah I
tried so many of those and they always
turned out for me yeah like the
omelettes like you guys you try any of
the recipes and make sure to send them
our way
either Twitter or Instagram or anything
like that if you are new to my channel
and if you came from until this channel
please be sure to subscribe and let me
know if you guys came from her channel
because I would love to meet you guys
and if you guys are watching this video
right now be sure to check out her video
right after because I am doing a healthy
breakfast so college healthy breakfast
ideas and I'm gonna do healthy snacks on
my channel so be sure to watch both of
those that let us know what you think
send us the recipes that you guys try it
and let's get started in the video
alright the first breakfast I'm gonna be
showing you guys is avvocato toast and I
feel like this wouldn't be a vegan
breakfast without it so the recipe you
will need is sriracha red pepper garlic
powder two pieces of whole wheat bread
and a baby avocado or half of a
normal-sized avocado
this is just for portion control and
basically what I do is I just put it in
the toaster and you toast it for your
desired liking I like mine to be a
little toast here
once your bread is toasted you're just
gonna go and spread some avocado on the
pieces of bread Mikado's are one of the
healthiest fats that you guys can
consume but please keep in mind that
healthy fat does not mean that you can
eat unlimited of it although they are
super healthy you still some limit it to
at max half of a normal-sized avocado a
day a serving size I think is only 1/4
or 1/5 of an avocado to put it into
perspective but all of those healthy
fats are going to keep you full and
they're gonna signal your brain that
you're full and satisfied so they're
very very good to consume so please
don't shy away from eating them just
because of the word fat in it
your body needs healthy fats once you're
done spreading your avocado on your a
piece of toast I'm just gonna go and
apply garlic powder this is so freakin
good I like it better than salt so I
just put a lot of garlic powder on it
and then I also put some red pepper
flakes put it in my hand first just so
that I don't distribute too many of them
because then it'll be a little too spicy
for me so I just make sure that I can
control where the red pepper flakes are
going and then after that I add sriracha
you guys if you have not had avocados
toast and sriracha you need that in your
life sriracha is so good it's literally
my favorite I ordered this jumbo bottle
in the beginning of the year and I'm
almost out of it because I eat sriracha
so much but that is it for the avocado
toast it's super easy and will
definitely keep you full
and the next meal is another toast but
this one is totally different it's way
more sweet but still savory so what
you're gonna need is one piece of
whole-wheat toast a banana and pistachio
butter or peanut butter or almond butter
or whatever
I love pistachio butter though and I
just recently picked it up so you know
what to do you're gonna toast it to your
desired liking just like the avocado
toast and then I spread my pistachio
butter all over the piece of bread I
just did a thin layer but I actually got
this at the farmers market which is at
the Grove in LA but I'm sure you can
find it at any local farmers market he
doesn't write there in the store and it
seriously tastes so good and all it is
is just 100% pistachios next I'm going
to put bananas on the piece of toast so
I just applied as many pieces of banana
that could fit on it so for me it was
just half and then this isn't pretty but
I just added some more pistachio butter
on the banana just to give it a little
more flavor and so they could have that
taste in every single bite when I bite
into the banana and that's it this is
literally the easiest breakfast
this next breakfast is a refreshing
green tea smoothie it's delicious and
all you need is spinach matcha mango and
vanilla coconut milk or any non-dairy
milk of your choice
I like the vanilla one because it adds
sweetener to it so I just pour one cup
of vanilla coconut milk into the blender
and I just used the rest of my mango
chunks so you guys can use more or less
i eyeball smoothies I never actually
take like real measurements and then I
just put a bunch of spinach in it
because spinach as you guys know if you
guys have ever had a green smoothie you
literally don't taste the spinach it
shows ads all of the benefits up the
spinach without the flavor and then I
apply one to one and a half teaspoons of
matcha I have culinary matcha though so
it is a little bit stronger and then you
just blend away so blend it to your
consistency that you want but reasons
why I love this is because matcha is so
good for you it one it has as much
caffeine as a cup of coffee and it is
packed with antioxidants
boost metabolism and it burns calories
so it is a superfood
I love matcha green-tea
and for my favorite breakfast is acai
bowls I have been making these like
crazy lately and I just love them
because you can make them so different
so for this one I just have chia seeds
granola acai packet banana blackberries
almond butter and coconut milk so that
was a mouthful but I just apply I keep
saying apply but I just put about 1/4
cup of coconut milk in this one and then
I squeezed out the acai packets
this one has kale and spinach too so it
actually has more health benefits for
you than just being the acai super fruit
and then I just apply a couple berries
but I just did this because that's all I
had I do wish that I had some frozen
berries and maybe made some more just to
make it a little more icy I guess so I
realized that it needed ice so I applied
a little more ice to it and then just
blend it all up and then I put it into a
bowl and of course you can just make it
any consistency that you want you can
apply or put a banana in the blender too
but I only had half a banana left and I
wanted to save it for toppings and also
I normally add protein powder to this if
I'm having it as a full meal just to
keep me full for longer and then I just
go ahead with the topping so this
changes for me all the time so first I
did the bananas next I just apply like a
teaspoon of chia seeds this is a really
great source of fiber and I applied some
granola because granola is so good it's
not that good for you but it's just such
a good crunch if you don't eat a lot of
granola it's definitely not bad for you
whatsoever so go ahead and put it as a
topping and then I also put almond
butter and I just drizzle it on top and
I'm telling you guys this is what makes
my acai bowls amazing so that is it but
I always switch it up with the toppings
just apply any of your favorite fruits
and last but not least is this overnight
chia seed pudding it's so delicious but
you're gonna ignore the honey because
honey is not vegan actually so I did not
use it but I'm just gonna put one cup of
coconut milk and I still use my vanilla
sweetened one but that's up to you and
then I did two tablespoons of chia seeds
and chia seeds are such a great source
of fiber so I definitely recommend that
you guys have them in your diet and I
just applied well half a teaspoon
something eyeballed it um of vanilla
extract and I also put some blueberries
in there just to give it some fruitiness
and I also put about half a teaspoon
again just eyeballing it half a
tablespoon I don't really know of
cinnamon and then I mixed it all
together and once you do that that's
literally it for overnight like you just
put it in the fridge and in the next
morning it is ready to eat it is the
easiest thing that you can make it takes
not kidding two minutes so once you're
done it has a pudding consistency and I
a put agave instead of honey because
agave is vegan but that is it for my
healthy vegan breakfast I really hope
that you guys enjoyed again if you came
from Matilda's channel let me know go
check out her video if you haven't
already and let me know which one of
these is your absolute favorite so I'll
see you guys next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
