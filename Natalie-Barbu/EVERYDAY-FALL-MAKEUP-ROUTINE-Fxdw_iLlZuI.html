I am filming my everyday fall makeup
routine so this is basically what I've
been doing when I wear like a lot of
makeup I actually do kind of wear makeup
every single day because my skin has
been breaking out like crazy lately and
I never break out like I am not used to
breaking out I probably I broke out a
lot like sophomore year of high school
and then since then I have not broken
out at all and I've been like so lucky
and then this year I've been breaking
out like crazy so I'm very confused with
why uhm what's going on with my skin and
I haven't really changed anything so
that's why I'm like really confused with
that but you guys will see I have a lot
of like acne scars and like just like
pimples and stuff like that and like I
don't know you can't tell because I do a
great job at covering it up and the
products I use are so amazing and
incredible but I do definitely need to
like wear makeup because I feel so
unconfident and insecure in my own skin
whenever I have acne so I don't always
do my eyes or like the contouring but I
definitely always wear like concealer
and foundation because I feel so
insecure about my skin so any of you
guys are going through having like
breakouts and stuff like that then I
feel you I know mine might not be as bad
as some of you guys or it might be a
little better than some of you but
regardless I understand what it's like
to feel insecure in your own skin so
this is my fault makeup routine that was
kind of a long intro to that but hi guys
