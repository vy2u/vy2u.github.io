I am filming a everyday makeup tutorial
this is more of a bronze makeup tutorial
so I don't wear makeup every single day
but I actually do a lot this summer
because I have a job but when I'm trying
to look really cute and like really
summery and kind of look tan even though
I have been in the Sun in like a year
then this is the look I go for I have
been loving absolutely loving the whole
bronze highlight look I'm definitely not
a professional makeup artist but you
know I try I try and before I started
into this video I want to let you guys
know this
it's a sponsored video and I didn't tell
you guys when I do sponsored videos just
because I feel like it's kind of shady
if I don't much address it so yeah I'm
just trying to beat it this is a
sponsored video it is with an app called
show luxe and it's actually a new app so
go ahead and download it right now it's
basically kind of what I would describe
as a vine for youtubers but also a vine
for people who just want to be
influencers basically so if you don't
think that you're funny enough for mine
that's fine I'm not either it's it's
cool but you still love makeup but maybe
you don't want to start a YouTube
channel or maybe already have one but
you kind of want to do like a little
other short video clips that it's kind
of one of us to make a whole video on
like you want 30-second clip but like
you don't want to put a 30 second
YouTube video up so that is what I've
been using show bucks for so if you guys
haven't seen my show box profile in my
show bucks closet then go ahead and see
that because I have actually a lot of my
summer favorites and there I was gonna
do a favorites video but honestly those
I feel like are just me like rambling on
about which favorites and by the time
you get like two minutes in you kind of
turn the video off cuz you're bored
so the my Chromebooks profile and it's
actually gonna have like allow my summer
favorites it's just going to be short
little video clips you can shop on their
way out without further ado I will start
into this makeup tutorial
so the first thing that I start out with
is mixing a bronzing serum with my
foundation and then I just apply that
with my Beauty Blender bronzing serum it
really gives me just a more golden glow
and it just makes my foundation a little
bit darker because I use this one also
in the winter time so I just blend that
to get a nice coverage
after I do that I go in with a lighter
concealer underneath my eyes I don't
have too bad of under-eye circles but I
just think it brightens it up so that's
why I use that
after I put my foundation I just go in
with my favorite powder and whichever
one works s for you and I put that all
over my face to set my foundation and I
also put a little bit of translucent
powder underneath my eyes now this is my
favorite part so I actually take just a
little concealer brush and I put it in
my bronzer and I swirl it around where
my cheekbones are so where I'm going to
apply the other bronzer this just gives
it a nice a base for my contouring I
don't know if this is a technique but
it's my technique and I contour my nose
sometimes I don't do this every single
day but sometimes I do just to kind of
give me an overall bronze look and then
I go in with another shimmery bronzer
and I actually like this shimmery one it
kind of gives it more of a highlight and
I put that where I applied my original
bronzer then it kind of looks a little
bit too much because I apply a lot so I
go in with my powder brush and I swirl
it to kind of make it more even and more
natural-looking because I don't want it
to look like I have a harsh line and
then I go in with my favorite
highlighter and I use a powder
highlighter as well and I swirl that on
my cheekbones and lightly put it on
there until I can see it noticeable
because I really like highlight so I
actually put a lot so if that's not your
preference then obviously just put a
little bit
for the eyes I like keeping it pretty
simple so all I do is I go in with the
original bronzer that I used and I put
that in the crease of my eyes I like
this just because it makes it look more
natural and it's kind of makes it look
more even cuz you already have that
color on your face and then I put a
highlighter that I used all over my
eyelids and that is all I do for the
eyeshadow and then I just fill Anna my
eyebrows
also all the products I use will be in
my show books closet so make sure that
you check them out
with the same gel that I use to fill in
my eyebrows I actually line my eyes with
that it's a lot less harsh than a black
eyeliner for the summer and I think it
makes it look more bronze because it's
kind of all brown
pretty self-explanatory but I just go in
with my favorite mascara after that
as for my lips I go in with the new
world lipliner from Mac and then I just
put my favorite liquid lipstick on top
of that and I just fill in my lips with
a lot lip liner I feel like it lasts a
lot longer and if the liquid lipstick
kind of gets cracky or comes off a
little bit it's still the same color
that you have because you have that
liner underneath
