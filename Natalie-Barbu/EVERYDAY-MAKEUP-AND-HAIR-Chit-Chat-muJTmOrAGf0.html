different because I am NOT filming it
after I finished filming the video I am
just filming it right at the very start
so I decided to do a super casual get
ready with me
chitchat video I just kind of wanted to
talk to you guys I really miss you and I
love talking to you and I used to talk
to you so much and all my other videos
and then I started making like cooler
editing ones and then I haven't really
talked to you guys at all like there are
some videos that I don't even speak so I
just wanted to do one video where I just
sat down and talked to you guys so yeah
while I do my makeup and show you my
everyday filming routine so not really
everyday makeup routine because most
days I actually don't wear makeup I only
want to make up when I have class but
when I film videos or take pictures so I
am going to do with that makeup today so
I start out with Make Up For Ever
foundation I'm obsessed with it I just
put it on my fingers and I used to use a
Beauty Blender but now I don't really
use the Beauty Blender anymore
just because I know that it takes away
like it absorbs like 70% of the makeup
that you put on and media forever is
expensive so I started being a little
more smart and just directly applying it
on my face and buffing it out with this
brush it's like a flat brush I just got
it at CVS or Target or one of those
stores it's tweezerman I like it's just
any black topper brush works next I go
in with my instant age rewind that you
bracer I actually think I got the
foundation by accident because it's like
super thick but I'm just
have some sealer because I don't follow
any of the makeup rules I'm just kidding
I am like so annoying so yeah I don't
really do anything special I just have
put it under my eyes like a time and
then I actually use a Beauty Blender
this time just to to pick next I will go
in with my Mac concealer and I will just
put like barely anything like even that
is too much right now when I take my
Beauty Blender and I actually do use my
Beauty Blender
or some thing was just not the
foundation and I'll put it where I think
I have some acne scars or anything like
that that might show up on camera most
of the time I don't have too much so
it's not bad but I just kind of put it
in random places
next I actually have two powders that I
use yeah I use two powders because I
don't wear primer so I feel like if I
use more powder then my makeup will stay
on longer I don't really know but then
I'm using Revlon Colorstay or photo
yeah Colorstay powder and I will put
that all in my face this gives me a
little bit more coverage barely but it
just makes it look better in pictures
this one is great for pictures you guys
I really really love rabwah Monaco next
I go in with my makeup forever powder
and it's the translucent translucent
powder and I tap that on my face instead
of blending it like the other one I'm
gonna just tap it this is to set
everything I keep looking right there
because that's my only mirror I have I
am so sorry I'm probably so annoying but
next I go in with some bronzer and I am
like by far the worst person I know with
contouring so I'm sorry but basically
all I do is just suck in my cheek and
put on like the very top wears
and then after I actually use it I'll
kind of go in under my chin and just
like blend everything down it's really
like I don't have any technique next I
will go in with my blush and I normally
just use whatever blush I see sometimes
I use pretty Mac blush sometimes I will
use NARS orgasm it really just depends
but today I found this one so I actually
sometimes put it on my nose like I'll
swap it out like that just so that it's
more blended and not just on my cheeks I
don't know it can be gives it more of a
natural look next I go in with my soft
and gentle by Mac this is so beautiful I
want this like as a display in my room
but I will just go in with a brush that
looks like the face this one is a
two-sided one but yeah I just kind of
dip it in there and then again and I'll
just put it the very eyes of my cheeks
just i dab it like that and I'll go a
little above my eyebrow to you and then
that is it for my face okay now on to
the eyes so I use a Mac Paint Pot in my
eyes I actually left my bear study one
at home when I went home and I have this
like purple one so I've been using this
purple paint pot if you blend it out
enough you can't even tell when you wear
eyeshadow and it's a really pretty color
so it's fine now I do it just I use my
naked samokhin palettes a lot and I will
use the first colors if I'm not like to
go in
so I normally do dirty sweet and radar
it's kind of like a goldish around one
of the two today I'm using radar
I would sweep that on my lid this video
is so fun like it reminds me of old
YouTube where no one edited nothing and
everything was filmed on like Apple Mac
books I remember those days is where
those were the days was like 15 in there
saying go watch my first video it's like
super embarrassing it's really funny go
in with dirty sweets or armor today I
kind of want a gold look so I'll go in
with a gold in my crease and I know
normally you do darker colors in your
crease but again I think makeup has no
rules you can do whatever the heck you
want to do then I just put armor in my
crease to like my outer-v just to give
it a little more dimension so here is
not I look it's really simple I don't
really do that much to it but because I
have dark features that just looks
darker um yeah there's that much so for
eyeliner I've been using a Kat Von D
eyeliner and liquid gold I've been using
it her liquid liner and it is the bomb I
think oh shoot
open it the wrong way and it kind of got
on my hand
but there is my tops eyeliner I'm
obsessed with doing liquid eyeliner it's
kind of hard to do it on other people
but I'm like obsessive doing it all
myself I think it's so much fun I'm
trying to like wing it out you know next
I will go in it with my black eyeliner
pencil and I will line at the bottom of
my eyeliner or a bottom of my lower lash
line or not bottom of it but just my
lower lash line as you can tell I'm like
not very good at English so yeah this
just makes my eyes pop because nothing
really makes brown eyes pop but I feel
like this kind of done we zoom in a
little bit on these that's not my scarib
so I will go in with mascara so I will
curl my eyelashes and literally do not
have a mirror right now so that's cool
and I am NOT one of those people that
coats on my mascara like so many of my
friends okay step they like low on
mascara and it looks so good and I just
cannot do it I am so lazy I hate putting
on mascara and then I get it's a little
bit soon you just gotta flick it around
a lot tell me if you guys like it this
type of video of me just talking I feel
like it's really random
no one asked for it but I decided to put
one on big ways I like find myself so
funny sometimes and I like laugh at my
own jokes it's so not funny and I'm just
talking into a camera so you guys really
gotta leave like a ton of comments so
that I don't feel
for awkward what are you guys those
plans for Valentine's Day so that's
coming up I have a Valentine's video
coming up I'm so excited to edit it like
I am so excited yeah okay so that's it
for my eyes now moving on to my eyebrows
it's keep in mind that I do not do this
makeup every single day like I'm telling
you I only have class on Tuesdays and
Thursdays which is living the life I'm
telling you guys and well and I have a
lab on Wednesday but it doesn't count
because I'm done by like 10 and so I
only wear makeup on Tuesdays and
Thursdays like that is it I already have
pretty dark and thick eyebrows so it's
not the biggest difference but it just
makes them look a little nicer and then
I will go in with this brow Wow from
Maybelline I think I'll just brush out
my brows I know my eyebrows are not
everyone's favorite and a lot of people
are like oh my gosh
I is what they say and you know what
keep your comments to yourself because
you guys all sucks like I'm sorry I'm
calling you out but please don't leave
me and comments suck so yeah like you
suck and not my subscribers I freaking
love you guys I love every single one of
you but people who feel the need to
leave it nasty
meaning that comments just to make me
feel bad about myself
yeah not afraid to say that you guys
suck and sometimes I will line my lips
so I'm just gonna line my lips or write
really quick and then I will put this
Burt's Bees surprise surprise lip crayon
in the color to donuts and and it is
fully truly the best color I like almost
out of it
not almost out of it but like it's like
shove down a lot so trap stick you guys
this is a chapstick and I feel like it
makes my lips look so big but now that
my makeup is done I just wait for my
hair to dry says I never even saw what
you guys but I just got out of the
shower that is why my hair is wet so I
will just wait for my hair to dry and
then I will do something to my hair
whatever I decide I'm doing so I'm gonna
show you guys what I do today with my
hair and I will see you guys in like 20
minutes when my hair is all dry just
because I don't like blow-drying it
because that just adds extra to it
that's not very necessary so yeah I will
see you guys in like 20 minutes so I am
back my hair is now pretty dry today I
am going to strict in my hair and I am
using this hair straightener from
irresistible me it is the assignment
hair straightener and I freaking love it
I have had a straightener for so long
like it's been a really long time
probably since Thanksgiving and I have
never included it in a video as it is so
good you guys I am very picky with my
hair straighteners because my hair is
naturally pretty
um not curly by any means but it is wavy
and I don't like when my hair gets wavy
after about 5 seconds after I straighten
it it really annoys me so basically
putting up my hair half up half down
this straightener actually you can
adjust the temperature of it which I
like a lot because a lot of hair
straighteners
you can't just as I'm sure and then I
basically fries your hair cuz I don't
like putting that much heat on the
bottom of my hair because it does really
need it honestly and it tells you what
temperature it is right now is set to
400 and it can go all the way up to 450
which is a lot I am NOT going to put it
up that high though because that's going
to dry my hair so I'm putting it at
about 370 right now
I honestly get like really big chunks
and I know that you're not supposed to
get big chunks when you straighten your
hair because then it's like you have to
go over it a bunch of time but this one
seems to be getting them does anyone use
Apple music I feel like that's just like
a big like no one uses it like everyone
has Spotify they're like hey that's just
my group of friends but I feel like it's
Apple music as enemies more for like
like adults that don't have Spotify and
they think it's like oh my gosh Apple
just came out with this a really
original idea and it's like no your kids
have been having Spotify there a while
now just copy them I love Apple but they
do really steal ideas so I took out my
scarf because I was like sweating it so
much but this is the final product of my
hair this ears the Suomi straightener it
is so good you guys I will have it
linked down below so you guys can check
it out if you want but this is again
what it looks like down below all right
