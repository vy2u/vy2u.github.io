and today i am filming a everyday makeup
routine for you guys this is what i do
when i wear makeup i normally do wear
makeup everyday just because um I'm kind
of pale sail from the winter so I just
like wearing makeup um but yeah so this
is just what it is and I'm looking kind
of gross for you guys today I'm just
wearing like a big ugly t-shirt my hair
is still halfway wet I'm not wearing a
bra so that's the best feeling ever I
actually went out in public like this
like I went to get my starbucks and I'm
not wearing a bra and I'm wearing these
nike sweatpants so um yeah life of a
beauty guru right looking fabulous all
the time anyways so yeah this was kind
of requested honestly wasn't too
requested but I really wanted to film it
so hopefully I still like it but I have
an everyday foundation routine up and
this is basically the same thing as I
accept a tiny bit different because I
got some new products that I really like
and yeah um also if you're not
subscribed to me yet make sure that you
are because i'm going to be posting so
many new videos and i have so many new
video ideas and i'm so excited film i'm
actually filming another video right
after this but um yeah so make sure
you're subscribed to me if you're not
and and follow me on instagram for my
outfit of the days just randomness um if
you guys want to if you know I mean
that's cool too so without further ado
let's just get started into this
everyday makeup routine
so we just start off with a fresh face
and I use my true Match Lumi foundation
which is my favorite foundation ever
seriously leaves me flawless and then I
just Buffett aim with a flat top brush
and my brush is actually from tweezerman
if any of you guys are wondering I
seriously love this method of applying
liquid foundation next I come in with my
concealer and I actually have two
concealers that i use the first one is
by mac and i just put it on all of my
pimples that I have because lately I
have it right now lately I know this is
not compared to a lot of you guys that
break out a lot more a lot more than I
do but I still don't want to have any
pimples so I just put this all over my
pit bulls and blend it in and this is by
far my favorite concealer ever and then
I go in with my l'oreal lumi concealer
and I highlight the underneath of my
eyes and on my nose and I have to be
careful about my nose just because it's
peeling because I got sunburned but yeah
and then I just rub it in with my
fingers and I feel like the fingers or
the best way of applying this concealer
and any concealer for that part
so after I have my concealer and my
foundation on my face I like using a
Revlon Photoready powder and this has a
little bit of a color in it i think i'm
in the shade medium and then i go in
with my makeup forever translucent
powder and sweep that all over my face I
don't know I just feel like two powders
really sets it one is best for photos
and the other one is just best for
setting the foundation and concealer so
so looks like I just dropped my
translucent powder everywhere so that's
embarrassing but next I come in with my
cocoa contour by Too Faced and I use the
shade medium bronze which is the top
right corner and I do a little fishy
face and I put that in the hollows of my
cheeks and then at my temples just kind
of where the Sun hits it and it was
really easy for me to find her in the
Sun hits because I got sunburned this
week so I basically just put it over my
sunburn
next I go in with the brush that the
contour palette came with and I put it
on the bridge of my nose and the
highlights or the tops of my cheek and I
just add the highlight shimmery color on
there just to kind of brighten up my
face and I'm kind of new to contouring
so if you guys have any tips and let me
know then I apply my NARS orgasm blush
and I just put that and the apples of my
cheeks and I literally have used this
every single day for like the past four
years after I did all my face stuff I
come in with my Urban Decay makeup
setting spray and I spray that all over
my face and I've never seen how it
looked when I spray it so it's kind of
embarrassing after that is on to my eyes
i prime my eyes with my back pain highs
in the color bear study i believe and
it's seriously the best primer I've ever
tried in my whole entire life it really
makes your eyeshadow last all day long
and it's just very pretty to begin with
then I go in with my Mac I actually
totally forgot what this is but they
sold out of it so they don't even have
it anymore he's gonna like a liquid eye
shadow and I just put a brown shimmery
eyeshadow all over my lid just applying
it with my fingers my fingers are
definitely the best method of makeup
application in my opinion and then I go
in with a shimmery brown color from my
naked 3 palette I think it's called a
lit liar something where I honestly
don't really know then I just apply that
in my crease with a mac crease brush um
and yeah I really like a shimmery look
and then I apply with a blending brush
this gold color in my naked 3 palette
and I just blend that in and apply it to
my brow bone then i use my push-up bra
by NYX and i apply that underneath my
brow bone just to kind of really
accentuate my eyebrows and i just got
them done today so i'm really liking the
way they look and then with the other
side of this push-up bra pencil i fill
in my brows
sometimes I don't fill in my brows
sometimes I do it with this sometimes I
do it with powder it really all depends
my brows are very optional depending on
what mood I'm in and how much time I
have next I apply my favorite Urban
Decay glide on eye pencil in the color
zero it which is just a plain black
color and I apply that underneath my
lower lashline I know I normally don't
do it all the way underneath I kind of
just do three fourths of the way just
keep my inner be very bright and then I
go in with my Revlon Colorstay liquid
eyeliner which has been my favorite so
far I really like the felt tip liner
very easy to apply and I just kind of
apply that sometimes i winged it out
sometimes it don't again it all kind of
depends on what my mood is
now on to the mascara I just curl my
eyelashes and apply my favorite mascara
at the moment which right now is my lash
blast volume by covergirl so let me know
what your favorite mascara is because I
always loved trying and nameless out now
on to my lips I just apply a neutral lip
pencil from math and forgot what it's
called and really bad at this guy's but
then I'd apply that all over my lips and
I try to apply a little bit in my lips
and around the edges then I go in with
my favorite next lipstick in the color
Talia I'm pretty sure it is it's so so
so pretty and I have literally been
wearing this every single day thanks for
watching everyone and that is my
everyday makeup routine and don't forget
