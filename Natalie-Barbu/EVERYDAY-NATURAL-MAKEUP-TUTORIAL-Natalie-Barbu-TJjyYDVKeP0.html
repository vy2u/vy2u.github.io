natural makeup tutorial it's my everyday
makeup look and I just want to make a
simple tutorial for you guys so let's
just get started first thing I start out
with with every makeup tutorial is
primer this one is from Laura Geller and
it's in the color champagne and it's a
tinted makeup primer so so good it
literally makes your foundation look so
glowy underneath and it's amazing it
feels so nice on your face and next I go
in with my Mac strobe cream and I
applied this to all the high points of
my face
and even though it's not summer I still
like to be super super glowy so that's
why I'm using all of these products but
I put the Mac strobe cream on my
cheekbones the top of my nose and near
my temples and then I have been using
the fenty by Rihanna foundation everyday
it's seriously amazing I did a first
impressions video of it and I loved it
but I have been using this every single
day when I travel it's the only
foundation I bring it's a really really
good medium to full coverage foundation
for me it's pretty high coverage because
I don't have blemishes but it's
definitely more medium coverage I would
say because whenever I do have a pimple
it doesn't cover it a hundred percent
but I seriously love it and it's a
little darker than my skin tone so I
make sure to bring it down my neck
because I did get this when I was a
little more tan and I'm one of those
people who likes to have a tanner
foundation and then I'm going in with
this Neutrogena hydrating concealer and
it matches my skin tone so I didn't want
to do any that's more brightening I just
kind of wanted one to make sure I don't
have any under-eye circles and this one
is so smooth you guys it seriously feels
like there's a moisturizer going on your
face instead of a makeup product so so
amazing and I have just been blending it
out with a Beauty Blender and it just
looks really really good and very
flawless underneath your eyes and then I
go in with my Laura Mercier translucent
powder and I used to bake like crazy
look I used to put so much product on
under my eyes and leave it there for
like 20 minutes but I recently have just
been baking a little bit so I've just
been putting just a little bit of
product underneath my eyes
wherever else I put concealer and then
spreading it all over my face and just
wiping it off right there because I
don't know I feel like it wastes product
when I put so much on and I've been
seeing the same results with this as I
was with when I didn't bake and next I'm
going in with the naked blush palettes
and this is the contour blush
highlighter and it's so so good I just
got this recently and have been using it
but I like it because the highlighter
the blush and the bronzer all matched
together so if you kind of want one
uniform to look they all look really
really really good together so this one
I'm just applying the bronzer with this
angled brush from bare minerals and I
really like this brush but the contour
the bronzer in this palette is so nice
and natural and I think it matches
really well with my skin tone to make it
look very natural not super contoured
like I have a brown line on my cheek and
so I'm just doing that and then after
that I go in with highlighter and blush
the only complaint that I would have
about this palette is that the blush is
not that pigmented so you guys can see
it's not going on that much but I don't
like heavy blush so for me it works out
fine and I think the bronzer and
highlighter make up for it anyways but
yeah if you're looking for a pigmented
blush this is definitely not the one for
you but after that I go on to my eyes
and I just prime my eyes with any eye
shadow primer that I find honestly I
don't really have a favorite and I just
put that on my eyes to make sure that my
eyeshadow stays on all day because I do
have very oily eyelids and then I go in
with my eyebrows so I am using the
precisely my brow from benefit which is
by far my favorite I think this is my
second or third purchase of this one
product and it's so so good so for me I
already have pretty thick and shaped
brows but I fill them in to make them
more structured and I feel like you have
good eyebrows you just look good overall
if you guys understand comment below if
you agree with me so I just start by
filling them in to the center and then I
start by going to the kind of like tail
end of it and then brushing them out to
make sure that it's all blended and I do
it for both eyebrows
after I do my eyebrows I go in with my
eye shadow and I am using this ciate I
think that's how you pronounce it makeup
and I like doing purples just because
with brown eyes
I think purple makes them look the best
and so I take a light purple color and
use that as my transition color so I
blend into my crease with this and it
just makes it easier for all the other
colors to blend and it gives it a good
purple base this palette is actually the
Chloe Morello palette and she's a
youtuber here on YouTube and it's really
really great it's literally my favorite
palette ever but next I'm going in with
a deeper purple and I'm applying that in
my crease with a smaller crease brush
and again trying to stick with the
purples cuz if you guys can tell just
like instantly it makes my brown eyes
pop so much more which is why I
typically mainly use like purple shades
whenever I'm doing my makeup if you guys
look at past tutorials I typically use
these types of colors with mixed with
browns and then after I apply that I go
in with a brown actually a lighter brown
and I use that to blend and to make sure
all the colors are blended together and
look good together so that's kind of
another one of my transition colors that
I use next I'm going in with this gold
color and I love applying sparkly colors
on my lid I think it makes your
eyeshadow pop so much more I'm not a fan
of like 100% matte eyeshadow looks and
less I'm going for something more
serious I guess like an interview but
I'm applying this gold color all over my
lid and it's seriously so pretty this
palette is hands-down my favorite
favorite palette ever I absolutely love
it and yeah it's just like such a nice
pigmented gold and it makes your
eyeshadow pop so much next I'm going in
with my absolute favorites Kat Von D
tattoo liner if you guys know me and had
fought then watching me for the past
like 2 or 3 years literally this is the
only eyeliner I use I have converted all
of my friends to this eyeliner so if
you're running out of a liquid one and
you need a new one
trust me this is so much better than any
drawer
or any other one at Sephora like this is
the best eyeliner can't even say enough
good things about it but anyways I'm
just lining my upper lash line and doing
a little bit of a wing not anything too
crazy because it is simple it is the
daytime this is just what I do best I've
literally can do this eyeliner in my
sleep because of how often I do it so
it's just my classic kind of winged
eyeliner and then I go in with my Dior
show iconic mascara and I just apply
that on my eyelashes and I am NOT a big
fan of mascara I think it's really
annoying putting on and I just like
don't I don't know I feel like eyeliner
is better than mascara in my opinion but
I really want eyelash extensions so I
need your help should I get them do they
ruin your eyelashes what do you guys
think or what are your other like
favorite eyelash growth ways I guess and
then I'm going in with my benefit lip
injection gloss so this is one that
instantly plumps your lips and you guys
will be able to tell like literally
instantly my lips look a little bigger
the only thing with this it doesn't last
very long so that kind of sucks but it
does sting a little but not bad at all
but seriously instantly it makes my lips
look bigger and honestly I really want
to go for that more like bigger lip
gloss look so here is the final product
