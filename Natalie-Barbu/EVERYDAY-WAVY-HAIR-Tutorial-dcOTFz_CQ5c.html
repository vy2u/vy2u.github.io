my most requested videos so far well
this in the back to school videos but I
already have done a back-to-school video
so this is my sittin most requested
video so far it is my everyday natural
wavy hair and kind of like surfing hair
like I'm very like beachy waves you know
and this is what it looks like hope you
guys like it I like it a lot I'm really
happy i have this type of hair and i'm
also see those in a different background
if you like i say that in probably every
video because i'm always in a freaking
different background but um i am
actually on a cruise right now so at the
end of this video i'm going to show you
a little bit at or my little cruise room
and then i'm going to show you the ocean
because it's so pretty um but yeah i
really hope you enjoyed this video and i
forgot to mention this in the video so
i'm going to mention it right now um
start don't brush your hair if you have
and this may not work if you have dead
straight hair just because I out
naturally have wavy hair so do not brush
your hair brushing your hair will just
not make it look good just scrunch it
when you get into the shower put your
hair in a towel wait like five minutes
with it in the towel take on the towel
and then just scrunch your hair don't
brush it at all like that may sound
gross but it's really not I mean I don't
have any tangles in my hair if you have
really tangling hair what's facing the
tangle internet and then scrunch it
because like trust me if you brush your
hair it will ruin the whole look I
promise you people with wavy hair should
not brush me or else that's why they get
it out to here with frizz so please
don't brush I if you wanted to look semi
decent um because I mean yeah just don't
rush it oh but just get out the shower
scrunch your hair and then let's go on
to the tutorial so hope you enjoy this
tutorial and let's get started
okay so the first thing I'm going to be
starting with is my hair about 80% dry
so it's only a little bit wet it's not
only that that wet anymore and then I'm
going to take this Bumble and Bumble
surf spray it looks like this this has
been my new best friend I really really
like this it makes my hair look really
good and then I'm just going to spritz
it all in my hair kind out and then you
don't want to spritz it at the roots too
much because then it's just going to
make it look hard and kind of greasy so
you don't really want to do it at the
roots kind of just from here all the way
down and you don't have to spray it
evenly throughout your hair because that
is just going to look like too perfect
it's nice if you have some parts a
little bit more some parts a little bit
less you know it looks a bit more surfy
I guess huh when you want to spray under
your hair
we just got that on my neck and this
thing I mean it doesn't smell the
greatest like it's not like oh my gosh
it smells so good but it doesn't smell
bad either so that's what I like about
it because you can always put like a
hair perfume like I know the pink sugar
has a hair perfume you want to spray
that in afterwards I don't really have
it with me but I have it at home so as I
cotton candy and it smells really nice
so after that I may have a little bit of
frizz so I'm just going to take
something and kind of smooth out the
frizz everyone so my camera actually
died so this is actually like an hour
and a half later an hour later from when
I was scrunching my hair so my hair is
already try right now and I put a little
bit of the first stuff in but not a lot
so now after I just crunch it and
everything I put a Fritz serum thing and
kind of just smooth it out at the top
because it cut my hair does get kind of
frizzy because wavy hair tends to get
frizzy um I got the sample at sephora
and I just decided to try it out because
I'm on a cruise and I didn't really want
to bring a bunch of stuff with me like a
big bucket of like a first serum so I'm
anti-frizz serum not frizz but um this
is the okay I feel like I'm going to
butcher this word what's the Fido Fido
list serum finishing serum it's like in
another language um hold on let me see
if you can looks like a clear bottle you
see it you let me see there it is
so that saturday so that's in a little
tiny bottle and i'm just going to do one
pump on my palm of my hand and it's a
very little pump i don't even think you
guys can see it because it's clear there
it'd be good and then i'm going to
spread it on my hands kind of one warm
it and make it so i can go everywhere
with it i'm just going to smooth it out
of the top and not a lot because then
it's going to look greasy so I just
submit via little at the top and then
kind of touch my hair like just like
this and then kind of scrunch it with
the serum in my hand so that I'm not
weighing it down but I am removing the
frizz so I just scrunch it with the Fred
serum and I normally put the freeze Fred
serum when it's dry so this part is fine
and I just I like this because you can
keep in your purse or something in case
your hair gets frizzy because like we go
out a lot take pictures in the balcony
and it's like we're in the middle of the
ocean so my hair is gonna get frizzy you
know but I really like that serum it's
kinda like a Moroccan oil I can kind of
do this for the frizziness Moroccan oil
I love it but um they don't have samples
so I can't really bring out a cruise you
know um but anyways that is pretty much
all I do to my hair PS can see just nice
wavy sea salty I used to do this is my
first video with a actually like this
and this I feel like it's so much nicer
um I normally use the curls rock but the
thing is my sister easily and it's
awesome but like I don't have curly hair
I have wavy hair so this one really
defines my waves and makes my waves a
lot nicer so I really like it i hope you
guys like it um and now i'm going to
show you around the boat because i
really want to you guys to see the ocean
because it's so pretty like I'm like
looking and I'm like isn't miles and
miles and miles of just ocean all around
us and it's awesome like I'm so excited
to be on this cruise so i'm going to
show you the ocean because i feel like
it so yeah ok
um so I am filming are you know in my
room hello look at my little stand on
where my camera was put on top of the
water um but yeah this is my room it's
gonna be a mess so beware it's just a
small room here's the couch with all of
my meme and my sisters crap on it our
luggages are and then here is our little
balcony okay let me try to get through
these luggages so you just open the door
and you slide it I can't slide it okay
so it's going to be really noisy it's
like Wendy and stuff hello chairs and
everything but I just love it so pretty
