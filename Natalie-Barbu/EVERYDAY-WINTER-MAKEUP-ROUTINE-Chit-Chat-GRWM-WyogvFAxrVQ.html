showing you guys my everyday makeup
tutorial so it is what you guys see
right here and this is what I wear
whenever I wear makeup typically as I'm
going out with the full face makeup this
is what I will do and if you guys have
seen my fault everyday makeup tutorial
then sword has only products I'm not
using like anything that I used in that
one so yeah it's like a 100 percent
different so hope you guys like it and
the winter my skin gets really really
dry so that is why I use all liquids and
no powders really but if you guys are
new to my channel and this is the first
time seeing my face please be sure to
subscribe if you guys want to Isis
videos every Tuesday and Friday and the
best of drivers ever so you know I don't
know I don't want me to feel bad but
like you might want to join in and if
you guys liked this video be sure to
give it a thumbs up also of course
follow me on my social medias I go there
a lot too something I want to follow me
on that definitely feel free to
everything like down below the guy this
is that I am unique in them I'm actually
filming on my vlogging camera right now
so it's the lighting is weirder like
it's not as great quality but it's still
good that is because my DSLR for some
reason is not working if you guys know
how to fix it it just keeps shutting off
every 5 seconds like the battery is not
dead it's just not working so I have to
take it into Canon and I said it'd take
about 2 to 3 weeks so I'm guessing three
weeks because I feel like it's Boies on
like the longer end of what they say so
I'm going to be using with longing
camera for a while I hope you guys like
this video let me know other video
requests you guys want in the comments
below and the way to speak of it and
must ascertain so we are just going to
start off with my very bare face I am
actually breaking it out a little bit
like skins was so clear before this but
I'm actually on my period right now so I
guess I am like 1 2 3 little pimples so
yeah I just think you know windows we're
going to get those covered up really
really quickly so I'm going to have
everything it links down below
and I'm just going to talk through the
products and everything like that it's
really right to chant get ready with me
is I just think they're more fun and
like personable and I like talking on
the camera so yeah that's what we're
going to do today I am starting off as
my Mario Badescu of gross water spray
this is seriously the best thing ever I
love it and this is what I set my
facelift
so I prime and set my face with it so
which is a bear skin moisturize skin I'm
going to spray this all over my face
it does take like a minute or two to set
so I don't want to put my foundation on
when it's like wet just use this mom
good so typically I'll do other things
in the mean time just to save time while
my name or my face is set I normally go
onto my eyes and just prime them this is
just to like get my whole face primed
and ready feeling isn't youtuber I've
learned to just talk and talk and talk
and like I'm saying the most basic
things like I don't need to say like
this with this eye primer on my eye
put it on my eye then rub it and it's
going to prime like I can just say I'm
using a primer so I by the way I do not
do this every single day this is like if
I'm doing a full face but still like not
going out with like a big smoky eye or
whatever this is what I do so this is
what I'm like trying to take pictures or
just wanting to look really really good
throughout the day or like filming or
something like that
so first I go with my strobe cream so
this is my Mac strobe cream and it is
the color silver light and I love it I
put it on the back of my hand
and I select a little dollop like that
sorry if you could hear like the outside
it's kind of annoying my window was like
it doesn't work Windows doesn't work it
basically just for like to prevent water
from coming in because it's a not
chopper at all so I just put the strobe
light on my high points of my face and
this is on a clear face so this is
actually underneath my foundation once I
mixed it with my foundation but it was
just like way too oily like it just
looks like too much and then with my
Beauty Blender I just kind of blend it
- my skin wherever I'd put it now am i
putting on a little dollop on my nose if
you just cute so Oliver eyes you might
need sour cream use sour cream
yeah it does like to take the excess on
my hand into salami cheese sauce that's
like what I want to highlight the most
um so I'm already glowing before it has
my something sighs I'm going in with my
favorite foundation ever in Tennessee
Mac Studio face and body foundation this
is so so so so so incredibly lightweight
and buildable and it looks like skin it
does not look like makeup like it does
not look cakey at all I tried cakey
makeup before and like trust me you know
with a little bit they look cakey this
one you have to put a lot on for it so
what cakey and it doesn't make you break
out at all so I put this on a flat
topper brush and I just squeeze it on
there and then I just dab it on my face
and I just like press it into my face
instead of swirling it I like pressing
it better because if you like that skin
or anything it just like purses down
it's a sea make it show and also I think
it just looks like more Photoshop like
flawless finish when you press it
instead of rubbing it if you rather
might have harsh lines they also try to
go my eyelids just to make them all kind
of look tan like my face and I self tan
so I do have a little darker of a
foundation than my actual skin tone but
it's not too bad the next I'm going to
go in with my concealer and I use the
Maybelline age rewind this one is like
completely out almost so I'm going to go
down to CBS and get a new one because
it's almost out but I just feel like the
little you know triangle underneath my
eyes whatever youtuber does I don't even
know what this is really done but thank
you because it looks cool and then with
my saving grace concealer I keep sleek
have on V concealer and this is
seriously the best concealer ever I do
think I need a darker color because this
is pretty light for like a pimple
concealer but it does the job and it
works so it doesn't look like bad I just
like I wish I had gotten a darker color
but
it's fine for now so now I'm going to
blend it oh I was like Beautyblender and
again it's still damp so I just like
press it in then I go in with my Laura
Mercier foundation powder whatever this
is translucent powder that's put it in
and I put this under my eyes and these
or this is the only powder that I use so
I applied with my Beauty Blender and my
Beauty Blender is when I use like
throughout this whole entire videos like
the one thing that I cannot be without
um so yeah I put this all underneath my
eyes and I just kind of pack it because
we're going to just brush it off later
now whatever excess I have I'll put on
my forehead my nose my chin but like I
normally don't really have access so
yeah I don't like to leave it on that
long so I just take any brush honestly I
should probably take like a specific
brush I just take any that I find and I
just brush it off my face after about
like 10 seconds because I don't like it
so then I don't and with my contour
stick so this is the L'Oreal True Match
contouring stick and this is like two
shades darker than my actual foundation
the super-casual get ready with me you
guys I hope they guys like it so I'm
just like talking to you um so I just
like find my cheekbones and just put at
the top like a line like that bring it
to the top say was here can I make it
symmetrical and then I'll do like one
one right there and then with my Beauty
Blender again I just blend it out so I
don't like giving too much bronzer
because then you look a little fake
so then after you blend out all of the
bronzer I go in with my liquid
highlighter actually and this is the mix
born to glow liquid illuminator like the
pink one I like the pink one for the
winter and again I put this on the back
of my hand and I don't put too much
since I already put the strobe cream
this is just kind of like to top it off
but wherever I put the strobe cream just
like the high points of my face
I actually don't put this on my forehead
and my chin though I put the strobe
cream there and I just put this on the
high points and then after you guys
blend that out and I just have had it in
with my Beauty Blender and I tried
blending it into the bronzer to make it
look like they're all together and not
like two lions if you know what I mean I
don't want that so I'll like blend my
bronzer back up to it I just like this
to be very very subtle and then whatever
is left over I just put on my nose so
now moving on to the eyes start off with
my eyebrows this is like my favorite
part so I just brush them out and I use
the Anastacio powder I use the dark
brown powder as you guys can see and I
lightly fluff it out I do not like the
boxy look I hate when people have boxy
eyebrows like literally like it looks
like you glued on your eyebrows so I
just try making it look more natural and
like I don't know still dark and defined
but not like Sharpie don'd so I pick up
my brush every stroke to just make it
look more like actual hair and not like
the sharpie that make sense but yo it
uses a boxy look and you dig it then
keep doing you I'm just giving you guys
my opinion so yeah I just do really
really like subtly but you guys can
definitely tell the difference but I
just don't like overdoing it and anyway
in my eyebrows this is no no makeup on
it my eyebrows are really really dark
naturally so I don't know
that much so again I just do the same on
the other eye after I go in my eyebrows
I go back with Maybelline brow drama and
to keep them in place I just run this
through it and this is a really really
great evening and employees like really
does the job for my eyeshadow I have
been using it via Kylie cosmetics
eyeshadow this is from her holiday camp
it is the holiday 2016 palette so the
colors I'm going to be using are this
like like kind of nude color and then
this more nude but like more purple in
color so those two colors are the only
ones I am using for my everyday makeup
look I take the lighter one and I will
end that into my crease and keep in mind
I already primed my eyelids I have to
prime my eyes I have very oily eyelids
and they will crease in like an hour if
I don't cram them and then I take that
darker but still nude color and I put
that in my crease but only kind of on
the outside and what I'm focusing it on
and this is a good to define it but
still keep it a natural eye because I
don't like doing like bold eyes for
every day I just don't want to look too
extra so I like these because they're
like very purple tinted and for brown
eyes purple looks best then I go in with
my favorite eyeliner and this is my
liquid eyeliner from Kat Von D it is
their tattoo or like ink tattoo eyeliner
and I just make a wing on my upper lash
line
look at the difference
it looks like Desai's like 20 times
bigger that's insane
so do you guys have any mascara
recommendations I've been using beat
that is a sex mascara but I've used it
for so long I'm kind of just bored of it
it's a great mascara I'm just so bored
of it so let me know if you guys have
any like favorite drugstore wands or
even light from Sephora or anything like
that I just really want to get a new
mascara and I'm about to go buy a new
one probably this weekend so if you guys
have recommendations on mascara please
let me know because this was great I'm
so tired of it and I like to meet a new
one so for everyday let's again I just
put on liquid lipstick this is my
favorite it's the honest coffee on
Beverly Hills on and this is in the
color shrimp by far my favorite
lipsticks advert it's amazing and it's
the perfect nude I never really mind my
lips right and let them go in al but
like just for everyday this on and then
to set my makeup I go back with my rose
water spray and there I have my final
makeup look so this is just what I do
every day I know I don't have completely
like online pimples covered but that's
fine
honestly I'm welcome going out for like
a big photo shoot then I would really
really pay attention to those but
honestly for an everyday look
you know pimples you have an acne scar
it's okay to just like not covering up a
hundred percent I don't know I've gotten
a lot better with getting more
comfortable in my own skin I realized
everyone has their flaws and everyone
had scars and everyone have pimples
everyone has things that they don't like
about their face and like it's a sign to
let them show I'd like to check out any
with me it was like really really creepy
to film and like I don't know how I'm
going to be editing it because so you
can tell them like I don't like it yeah
I hope that you guys liked it be sure to
give it a thumbs up and if you're not
subscribed please subscribe I would love
that so much I'm really hoping to hit
like sixty thousand by the end of the
month I like that and actually the end
of the most kind of coming near but
