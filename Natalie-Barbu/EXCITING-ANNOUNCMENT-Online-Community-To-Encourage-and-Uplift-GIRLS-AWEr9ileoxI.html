here with my best friend Katie her name
is katie and we have known each other
since 5th grade so we go like really far
back we've been really close for a
really long time and yeah she's one of
those friends that we can always catch
up when right where we left off but even
if it's really here yeah oh and if it's
been a year we can still catch up
totally normal and it's that's like
always a good friend to have and yeah so
we have a special announcement actually
and I admit things that I have special
about Senator okay videos and I'm so
excited that I'm finally able to share
it with you so we set out for coffee one
day and we were just like catching up
having friendly conversation during our
I see what exactly you know girly things
and so then we both felt that we had a
calling on our heart about reaching out
to young girls and young girls like you
guys that watch my videos and some of
you I know or other than me that watch
my videos but just young girls in
general and we both had a calling
we talked to them and to I don't be a
older sister I would say to them a
mentor not mentor but someone to walk
alongside you this crazy journey of life
so we both have that calling and leaves
just I was crazy because we have both
saying like oh my gosh guess what boat
then we both basically said stated it
was kind of weird it was a very weird
God saying definitely so we are actually
launching a website and I'm so excited
we are finally able to launch it and
we've been working so hard on this and
all summer a lot all summer and we
decided to let you sub site and it is
basically in two hours right that's
basically at an Internet community and
everyone's welcome we are religious
people but you are any religion like
you'd love for you to check it out
basically it's a place assistive space
to share prayer requests is there
anything that's on your heart on your
mind and we're going to be posting like
videos and blog posts I'm a blogger um
so linked down below yeah so that's
definitely my thing that we're
collaborating together hopefully branch
out and we're having this we have social
media and we just want to connect girls
that want to you know be on the right
path together and it's just a space for
people united through the internet to
kind of come together and form a
community she basically summed it up I
know that we all use the internet like
crazy I live on the internet basically
like my life both of our lives it got on
the internet so we are just thought this
is such a good idea because it's such a
safe space it's not you don't need to
call anyone you don't need to go to
someone's house or anything you can just
literally type in this website and feel
like we
I couldn't talk to us and it's a
community of girls and we're really
excited to where it leads us and where
god leads us in terms of reaching out to
you guys so this is not about becoming
famous it's not about the money at all
with that literally because both of us
have gone through high school feeling so
alone so like worthless and feeling like
boys control our lives in terms of
whether we're good enough or not and I
think that that's a typical thing of
most girls go through that and I don't
ever wish that upon anyone but I know
that it happens and you know that today
teenagers have so many problems that
parents don't understand and even people
in their mid-20s don't understand
because so much has changed we are the
generation that has the most change
because of the internet and so that is
why we're reaching out to you guys in
making this website and I'm really
excited it's called becoming rooted
because we want to emphasize that if
you're rooted in the right things if
your security is found in your own
confidence and God and in you know doing
making decisions for yourself and not
for to please other guides or anybody
else's attention then will become more
secure you will become
rooted and it's called becoming rooted
because you know we're not there yet for
right there walk with you guys we're not
perfect in any way and we're not trying
to say we have it all together don't
know we're just here to kind of you know
reach out and support and hopefully we
can all form a community where we
support each other yeah definitely we
are not trying to say that we're perfect
at all we are not coming to you with a
lecture or anything at all because we
are doing this alongside of you which is
why we kind of want to be a friend and
or an older sister or anyone that you
need in your life because we are not we
are not leaders we are not we're not
teachers we're doing this with you and
we are going through the struggles that
you're going out and I think it's so
important to have a community and a
group of people doing it alongside of
you that are encouraging and uplifting
and not bringing it down so that's
basically what the color that is and I
have a launch video that i will be
posting on the main channel of our
becoming rooted YouTube because we will
have one of those that everything will
be on the website so everything's on
becoming rooted com so please check that
out let me know what you guys think
about it and I'm so excited all our
social media links below everything will
be down below if you have any more
information or questions if you have any
questions comment them and I will
respond to you I promise so please yeah
check it out and I hope that you guys
enjoy this and thank you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
