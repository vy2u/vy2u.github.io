up because that helps me know what type
of videos you guys like what's up videos
you don't like and comment down below
the other fall videos that you guys want
without further ado let us get started
into the video so we are just going to
start off with priming our face I used a
radiance primer this is from Laura
Mercier since it's the fall and the
weather is going to get colder I like
using a little bit more highlight and
shimmer because my face is more dry
and next I go in with my favorite Mac
strobe cream this is just to give a
highlight from underneath your
foundation it makes you just look like
you're naturally glowing and not like
you have shimmer on your face like
normal highlighter does and I put this
on all of the high points of my face and
it just looks really really nice over or
underneath your foundation I know it
looks super greasy on your face but
don't worry because the fancy foundation
that I am using is full coverage and
it's pretty matte so that's why I like
having some shimmer underneath and I
love this foundation I rub it in with a
brush that I got from Sephora and I
bring it down my chin because it is a
little darker than my skin tone but I
like that better than being lighter and
then I go in with my concealer stick
from Sephora it's the make no mistake
line and I put that underneath my under
eyes and on the high points of my face
again during the fall I know it's not
all about like shimmer and radiance as
it is for the summer but because my face
is dry I just like making my face a
little more brighter so that's why I
apply more concealer and highlight and
all of that stuff and I rub it in with
my finger at first because your finger
is gonna warm it up and because this is
a foundation stick it is a little
thicker so that's why I like to make
sure it's a little bit more blendable
and then I go in with the same brush
that I used for the foundation and I
blend it out with that next I am going
to set my face as a powder so I am
putting it on with a brush and just
putting it on wherever I put the
foundation stick so I don't put it all
over my face but just to make sure that
those don't budge or creates under my
under eyes and then I go in with the
Fenty contour stick and I contour and I
put that in the hollows of my cheekbones
and then again on my temples and I'm
going to be blending it out with the
same brush you could use a Beauty
Blender but I'm in one of those stages
or I'm kind of bored of the Beauty
Blender so I'm trying out different
brushes I don't know let me know if any
of you guys get into that stage and if
you ever see me looking away to that
side like I just did because I'm playing
One Tree Hill and
on my computer and so I was kind of
trying to watch that as I was filming
this makeup tutorial I'm trying to watch
it before it goes off Netflix because
it's going off in two weeks and I'm
currently on season five
so yeah petition to not remove One Tree
Hill off Netflix would be nice
next I apply my highlighter this is from
Laura Mercier and it actually broke so
that's why it looks like a mess but I am
applying a gold one because I feel like
for fall I like using more gold tones
and warmer tones so that is why I'm
doing that I play it on my cheekbones
and I love the nose highlight so I
applied that and on my chin and my
Cupid's bow and just everywhere that I
applied the Shoaib cream I love this
highlighter because it's very very
subtle I'm not a huge huge like BAM
highlighter fan then I go in with my
brows and I use the precisely my brow
I've been using this for a while I
absolutely love it and I am just going
to go along with my natural shape and
make sure that my brows look very nice
and defined
now I'm going in with my morphe brush or
morphe palette and I'm applying a light
brown with orange undertones and I'm
applying that with a blending brush onto
my crease this is going to serve as a
base for my shadow because I am using a
lot of orange shadows next I'm going in
with a deeper orange and again with my
blending brush blending that out I like
to have that with my blending brush
because I kind of want to have that as
my base as well because this is more of
an orange smokey eye then I'm going in
with the maroon ish color and applying
that with a crease brush and I'm
directly applying that to my crease and
I'm focusing on the outer portion of it
just to make sure that it's not all over
because it is such a dark color and I'm
bringing it down with the same brush
underneath my eyes and next I'm applying
this super super shimmery golden orange
color this is so pigmented you guys the
morphe palettes are great on color and
pigment and I am applying that all over
my lids so I'm just applying it with a
lid brush all over and it's definitely
gonna give me that nice shimmery look
that I am going for and be sure to be
careful with it because you don't want
any to go underneath like on under your
eyes or anything like that because there
might be some fallout from the glitter
but I loved the way that this looked
then I'm going back in with the more
maroon color and just reapplying it into
my crease to make sure it's more blended
and that none of it got covered from the
shimmer color and again applying that
underneath my eyes I like bringing the
color under my eyes because I think it
gives it more uniform look and then I'm
going in with a super pigmented gold
color and I'm applying that over the
shimmer because I felt like it was too
orange I wanted to break up the color a
bit by introducing as gold so I'm
applying that on my lid not covering it
up completely but mainly on the middle
part and then I'm just applying a liquid
eyeliner this is my Kat Von D liquid
eyeliner it's my favorites and doing a
winged look on to my eyes
I like the black contrasts with it
because before I applied the eyeliner it
made me look kind of like I had pinkeye
or something like that so make sure that
you have eyeliner on
and then I'm just applying a pencil
stick underneath my eyes to again define
it a little more and I think it looks so
much better and now I am curling my
lashes and I'm just going to apply my
favorite mascara and lately my eyes have
been watering like crazy so I haven't
actually been wearing mascara so let me
know if you guys have an issue with your
eyes like constantly watering and what
you did to fix it then after that I am
just going in with my lips and I am
applying a lip liner and filling it in
all over and then I'm actually just
filling in and kind of in the middle of
my lips so all around and then just in
the middle and then I am applying a
liquid lipstick on top the color I like
is because it's a little more dark and
neutral I guess so I feel like it
matches with the eyes and don't want to
say it's orange but it needs a little
warmer tone and that's kind of the look
I was going for for this whole makeup
tutorial and then after that I am
applying actually the gold highlighter
that I use onto my lips to make them pop
a little more because they looked a
little bit dull I realize just so I'm
making sure to apply it in the Cupid's
bow and just on the center of them and
it's gonna make them look bigger and
just more like BAM you know and then I
am done with the whole makeup tutorial
so I hopefully you guys liked it I hope
