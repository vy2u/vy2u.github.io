februari favorites video and oh my gosh
i know it's like the middle of march
already but i don't remember the last
time I filled the favourites video like
I really don't remember the last time
I've own favourites videos my first
favorites of the month of februari and
basically the past like five months has
been this True Match Lumi healthy
luminous makeup I'm not sure many of you
guys have seen this in my other videos
before or other your YouTube gurus I
really have not seen this make up a ton
on like with other YouTube gurus but it
seriously better than any high end
makeup in any drugstore makeup I've ever
had it does not leave you cakey it's
full coverage but not like chew full
cover I guess it's like medium coverage
well it was concealer everything just
goes away and it's not picky most of
things that cover me as well as this one
does you really get tell I have
foundation on but this one I all it
basically looks and feels the tinted
moisturizer except it covers all your
pit bulls and I have been breaking out
so much lately guys like its I have like
a clump right here and right here of
pickles and then I've been getting
pimples like along my hairline not too
many long my hair line which is took a
couple and this really really covers it
up name so insecure about my skin so I
really recommend this makeup I'm in the
color sand beige w five
we're wondering actually kind of has to
do foundation also is this urban
outfitter or not earn an outfit a curb
Decay all nighter makeup setting spray
and it's the long lasting one this is
what it looks like the bottle is super
dirty and excuse my really ugly nails
but um yeah this basically I just use it
as like a primer to set my makeup so
after i put on my i first put on my
foundation i put on powder that i put on
bronzer blush sounds like a lot and I I
never look cakey guys I promise then I
said I with this and it really really
does the trick because I really don't
like wearing primer but I just got a
sample of some primer cover FX primer
from Sephora and I've been liking it so
far but if you guys break out with like
every single primer known to man and
then you fight like that one that worked
please let me know in the comments below
because every single primary I've ever
tried in my whole life is maybe break
out and I have yet to find one good one
so please let me know um yes so I've
been using this basically set my makeup
and I actually really like it and yeah
my next makeup that is also has to do
with the vase is my cocoa contour
chiseled to perfection two-faced palette
so its face contouring at my wedding
cake I actually got this in the month of
March so it's kind of not of heaven very
favorites but so far i've been loving it
so much I just had to cluded in this
video so yeah basically this is what it
looks like in a smaller chocolate it
smells so good no no
it smells so good and this is like what
it comes in so it has highlighting a
medium bronze which is what I use to
find an aunt or dark brown like dark
frogs and then a shimmery highlight and
then on touring and I am like I'm not
very good at contouring knock and lie so
I've been watching a lot of videos and a
lot of time and experiment with my
contouring skills so if you guys have
any tips and tricks to let me know in
the comments below because I'm really
trying to be able to contour like a row
right now I'm basically just doing that
you know that motion thing yeah my next
favorite it's kind of also along the
lines of the face it is my L'Oreal magic
Lumi highlighter and I actually didn't
realize that it was basically like the
same thing is this but yeah it's the
highlighter and I actually use this as a
concealer underneath my eyes and it has
a crush applicator that I've already
comes with and it is not focused I'm
sorry but yeah it's really really pretty
it's a couple shades lighter than my
normal skip town which is good so I just
fly underneath my eyes and on my nose
and it'll do like three little lines
kind of on my forehead and it looks so
good and I love this and i love the
applicator that it comes in and i think
it's a lot lighter concealer for the
summer which is good it's not summer yet
but you guys oh i have in my brain is
summer i'm on full summer mode so yeah
already buying my summer
basically essentials my next favorite is
my eyeshadow primer and I actually got
the wrong color showing you guys this
but it is my paint pot by Mac I got the
stormy one to show you guys which is
awesome when you do smokey eye but
normally I just use bear study so it's
just like a white color creamy champagne
white color you just put it all over
your lid and it works it's like the best
eyeshadow primer I've ever tried better
than primer potion better than to face
whatever better Laura Mercier like it's
the best eyeshadow primer ever and the
best thing about the Paint Pots is that
you can get bear study which works for
any eyeshadow color you want or you get
things like this a sorting pink which is
an awesome base for creating a smokey
eye or just kind of a darker purple look
so yeah I definitely recommend it mcafee
pods for sure sounded really stupid next
product is my eye products so my very
first one is my covergirl LashBlast
volume and I know you guys are probably
thinking like oh my gosh Natalie I had
that in like seventh grade like get with
the program okay well some things were
shown in seventh grade and then I was
like okay I'm gonna try out new things
and then I never went back to them but
we would meant to invest seventh grade I
didn't wear my concept grade like 10th
grade anyways but like and then I never
met them and I capturing news aids and
high-end things that which are all
awesome too I was on CBS the other day
and I was like food
to love this mascara like I just want to
try it again because I was looking for a
new mascara because mine right now and
of course I would give me for a new one
because I can't go back to the same on
because I love trying new things and so
yeah I picked this one up and now i
remember why was my favorite in 10th
grade and why it was so popular among
the youtube beauty community because it
really is such a good mascara and i
recommend this everyone and i get the
shape blackest black or black or
whatever it is yeah I just get black and
it's awesome it really makes your
eyelashes elongate and builds volume and
it's very natural looking so you know
that props to cover girl for making such
a good mascara that is consistently good
throughout the years hi second eye
shadow front of our third eye shadow I
product something like that is my NYX
and YX mix however you guys pronounce it
a push up bra for her eyebrows which I
actually never knew that's what it was
called and of it I know that's called a
push-up bra for your eyebrows I like it
so many more but yeah this is what it
looks like Anna benefit make someone
very similar to this but this one is 10
times cheaper so don't we get this one
because it's literally the same exact
thing but yeah so I have it has the
push-up bra part i guess the highlighter
part so this is the highlighter part and
I just highlight my eyebrows with this
so I put it right underneath my eyebrows
kind of shaping it like right in my brow
bone it seriously just wanders you guys
we will change the way you look at your
eyebrows when you have this amazing it
just really brings them out and makes
them look super neat and if you have
tiny straight here on sweep it up like
old Bush over drone but maybe a little
tiny stray hairs it covers them up
pretty well and then I kind of shade
them in with either this side the brown
like shading inside or I'll shave them
in with my nastassja eyebrow shaping
thing so yeah but this is an awesome
product it's like five dollars so much
for the benefit comes with two things
and works like a charm and it doesn't
run run out because this gets kind of
dull but you can just reach our pin it
so if you guys don't have an eyeshadow
for it I pencil sharpener and definitely
get one they're really cheap just get
look at the cheapest when you mind
because they don't do the same thing um
and yeah this will be good to go to like
a little nub that's not planning on how
often I'm putting you into using it till
it runs out and sleek this small last
but not least makeup is my favorite lip
product and I'm wearing it on my look
today so if you guys were wondering what
it is it is this NYX color 529 okay to
color Thalia um it's a very like kylie
jenner reminds me of a neutral lip shade
my mom gave it to me she'd like it on
herself but oh my gosh I love it so much
I'm gonna try me keeping it on with a
light pink lip gloss over top and see
how that looks because it's a very like
warm like fall winter shade and I am
trying to look for like the new hot
lipstick so if you guys let me know like
your favorite lipstick that spring in
the summer let me know because I kind of
want like a hot not hopping like a very
like Barbie pink but not too Barbie like
just like a neutral pink color that's a
little more on the lighter side like a
baby doll hey baby
welcome hey I don't know what I'm saying
I think it's so funny how there's so
many different names for like a shade of
what one color like I'm saying like baby
girl pink bubblegum pink like hot big
bar beeping like why are there so many
different shades I'm I could just say
pink and I think he doesn't know I was
like I really have to go to the bathroom
so I won't be right back TMI sorry guys
ok I'm back so sorry that might have a
little gross for you guys I don't think
knowing someone's going to the bathroom
is gross but you know girls gonna do
what she's gotta do so yeah I'm just
gonna hop right back into the savings
video ok so now for my hair favorite so
I normally just kind of do my hair
naturally not today today it's not
natural but up and I really been trying
to get it to grow out because my ear I
put it and it's not technically short
but it's a lot shorter than it should be
and I don't like I don't know I like my
hair but I really wanted to be like long
like super long so I have this new
products and I really like them and they
are period or argan oil premium organic
shampoo and IAM organic conditioner it's
a hair loss prevention therapies
actually what it is and it's really good
because I'm just going to do a whole
video on my hair because I have family
perfectly every never like I've never
been more happy of my hair teen in my
whole life so definitely look out for
that isn't going to be doing one but
he's like a little snippet of it this
shampoo in this conditioner not only do
they smell looking amazing
but I don't shed as much as I used to
and you guys like I don't think you
understand how much I shed like every
time I would step foot into a place my
DNA would go everywhere because I
literally shed so much so this is really
helping with that just go ahead and it
is shedding its kind of gross and you
know when you're like in someone's room
and stuff and then they're like oh I
think of hair like throw it on the floor
and you're just like that's mine you
know so this has really made my hair
aldi and it's super shiny and I'm really
really been loving it but my favorite
part of this whole set is actually this
pura d'Or argan oil body hair face
treatment it's just argan oil which a
lot of you guys like no like Moroccan
oil and different bargain oils stuff
this one's good because it's watching
friends of the red smoke and it makes me
here so shiny and my favorite part about
it but normally I have to wash my hands
I have done using hair products cuz I
want to like put it on my face I can put
that one on my face it's actually a
really good moisturizer for your face
and I always loved putting those two
things on my face so yeah anyways out
for clothing items okay stuff for
clothes this two things I really love
and bricks on is Komodos I don't know
why you leavin lemon Komodos I think use
