requested video for you guys this has
been requested so much so I am finally
going I'm doing my room tour and I've
been living in my house for about a year
and I keep up
I kept postponing it but I figured I
should do it before I leave for college
because I know that you guys are going
to want to see a dorm room tour so by
the way this is just gonna be a
disclaimer I am NOT making this video to
brag I understand and I'm fortunate to
live in a big house and have a big room
so you don't need to tell me that I'm
doing this to breath because I'm not and
I just did this cuz it was requested for
you guys and I know how much you guys
and how much everyone just loves a room
tour videos so without further ado let's
get into this video oh we are standing
outside my door right now I just have a
big dark brown door and my doorknob is
actually clear it's not the laughs but
it kind of looks like glass and my mom
did this and doorknob for all of the
girls bedrooms so we just walk right in
and I have a little hallway area over
here and then if you look to my right I
have my bathroom and so this doorknob is
actually normal but anyways this is my
bathroom and I'm not going to go through
all the drawers because they're mostly
all messy but here's my mirror and I
share this bathroom with my little
sister so that side is her side and then
this side is my side I just have a dream
box right here that I got from a friend
for from graduation or for graduation
and then over here at my Clarisonic my
so I like doing soaps that go with the
season so I have perfect each day we're
here I have my double
sited near one that's normal and one
that is zoomed in and then over here I
have my speaker that I listened to in
the shower it's in Bluetooth so it
doesn't need to be connected to my phone
over here I believe my sister made these
mason jars and I just have some crystals
in them and then I just put some two
random lip glosses just for decoration
then over here if we take a step back I
keep my makeup in those drawers and just
a random stuff in those drawers
that's my side of the room this middle
side is just mine and my little sisters
whatever we share so like face wash um
body lotion hair products it goes in
those middle drawers over that there's
her side and I'm not gonna go over there
to show you over here is my shower I
love my shower it's a big glass shower
with a seat in it and I never actually
sit down but I do shave my legs on there
so that's nice I just have conditioner
shampoo body wash condition or already
side conditioner and face wash
everything like that and then above here
I have a chandelier in my room or in my
bathroom and then over here I have a
nice little poster or not poster but
board that says sister best friend for
life player of dress-up teller of
stories in the dark and Keeper of
Secrets which I thought was really cute
and then I am air freshener I have my
toilet interesting and then I have a
trash can over there I have my dirty
clothes bin over there and then I have a
towel and you walk out of my bathroom
and then to the left of my entrance is
actually my shoe closet so this was just
an extra space that we didn't know what
to do it so we made a closet and put
shelves in it so I just keep all of my
shoes in there I have my yoga mat more
shoes it's just messy because I don't
have enough shelves and I haven't had
time to clean it and then over here I
have yearbooks at the top then I have
school supplies and books over there I
have jewelry over here and then I have
more books over here if you guys want me
to do like a book series let me know as
I read all the time over here I have
more shoes and then
there I have a box with just
miscellaneous stuff in it okay so you
exit out of my shoe closet and you come
over here this is my actual bedroom well
I mean the whole thing is my bedroom
this is like the main part so let's
start over here with my desk so my desk
I think is from Target it's just a white
desk you really like it and it just has
a drawer with a bunch of random stuff
over here I just have some gifts that I
got from friends I got these this gift
from my best friend Katie this gift from
my friend Daniel these two magazines I
just keep some magazines then I got this
gift and it's just that's a buncha candy
in it I have a shot glass from Cancun
that I'm giving to a friend just it's
kind of funny and cute and then over
here I have a picture frame with my
family from my junior prom some of my
last year's prom but mention your prom
number here I have a Henry Bendel candle
and Henry Bendel has a best candles you
guys I recommend everyone to get one
over here I have another candle that
actually is kind of like a decoration
I've never played this candle like crazy
little canvas that I found over here I
got this as a or I didn't get it as a
gift I got it during Valentine's Day at
Target so it was kind of like a
Valentine's Day decoration but I really
liked it over here my best friend Alton
gave me this canvas and it's just a
picture of us from prom last year then
over here my best friend Katie so two of
my best friends gave me this picture
frame for my birthday and then she gave
me a card and I just have that back
there
my lamp is actually from world market
I'm not sure if they have that
everywhere I know that they have it
where I am from so they have a this
lampshade or this lampshade in the lamp
didn't go together but I thought it went
well so I have this really cool looking
at pal
antique lamp with a bright yellow
lampshade on my wall I just made a
picture a heart full of pictures and I'm
getting ready to replace these pictures
with new ones just because they're
pretty old I just printed out pictures
from CVS and then I put double-sided
tape on them to make them stick so yeah
over here I have a bulletin board and
picture frames that are empty but I just
have a bunch of cards on them that I
kept just the memories I was on my
homecoming court so I have the sash and
then over down there I have a bag from
orientation okay over here I have my
fake giant mirror so you've probably
seen some selfies on Instagram that have
taken place at this mirror over here is
my tripod because this is where I film I
just have my tripod here and then I
bring it normally the chair over there
and I just set it down right here I also
have a carpet in my room or a big rug
I'm not quite sure where I got it from
but it's just orange with a pattern on
it as you can tell my room is very
colorful and has a bunch of patterns and
that's what I love about it so here's my
bed and so I have my graduation cap and
my graduation medal on my side of the
bed and then I have my graduation chords
over there I just kind of wanted to keep
the theme of graduation throughout the
summer my bed sorry it's a little bit
messed up this is what normally looks so
my bed is from Anthropologie the
bedspread is from Anthropologie they
have these softest and nicest bed
spreads and then my pillows are from

bed looks like from the bottom and just
standing in front of it I have my laptop
on my bed because I was actually editing
