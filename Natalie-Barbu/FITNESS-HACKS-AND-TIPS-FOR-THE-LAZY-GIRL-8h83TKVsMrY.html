I am coming to you guys with a fitness
hacks video this is my very first hacks
video ever and funny story I used to
really not like hacks videos like last
week I was telling my friend Steph here
on YouTube I was like I just really
don't like them and then she put one up
ironically and then I saw hers and then
I started watching other ones and I
actually really liked them so go check
hers out this is not a collab video at
all but you know YouTube love friends
love friends support anyways this is my
fitness hacks video and these are just
tips for the lazy girl that doesn't want
to work out or doesn't have to doesn't
have time to work out or just kind of
want some extra motivation so these are
hacks / just tips I don't really know
what the difference is don't forget to
get this video a big thumbs up if you
like these and also if you want more
fitness videos I just posted one like
last week and I'm going to post more
just because I have been getting into
good shape and also don't forget to
subscribe if you aren't already I post a
lot of new videos and I would love to
have you subscribe because I view all of
you guys like my best friends so yeah
let's get into the video so first one
you guys have may have heard before but
it is to do workouts while the TV is on
commercial a lot of people claim that
they don't have time to work out but we
all have time to watch TV or maybe not
every day I know I don't watch TV every
day but if I do watch TV a couple times
a week I definitely tried to do
something on the commercials I recommend
doing ab workouts during commercials I
just feel like you can just hop on the
floor start roll out your mat and start
doing some ab workouts just well the TV
is on break I use sworkit for that
because you can start and you can hit
pause and then it tracks your progress
so that is an awesome app so yeah no one
even likes commercials so instead of
Bath's wording them or instead of just
sitting on the couch or sitting on your
phone while you work on the commercials
you can pull out your phone and do this
working app or just any workouts right
by your TV the second one is just
little tip and it is to put workout
clothes on your bed the night before
don't just put them out the next morning
put them out the night before you were
dedicated to workout so when you wake up
you see this workout clothes and you
have no excuse even if you don't work
out the second you wake up put them on
wear them throughout the day and because
you have them on you won't feel like you
just have to workout I don't know when I
wear workout clothes
I feel like hey I'm already dressed in
the sports bra and running shorts or
sports bra and legging I might as well
workout today
number three is pretty obvious but it is
to break more water but to have
reminders on your phone so put on your
phone in the reminders section that you
have to drink this much water this time
this much water this time I have a big
water bottle and I will fill it up and
it'll have a reminder on my phone like
every two hours telling me that I better
have drank that whole water bottle and
it's time to refill number four is to
follow Fitness stars on Instagram and I
don't know if people use Twitter for
that but definitely on Instagram don't
follow too many but I like following the
obvious ones like Kayla it seems I think
sometimes you say your name that's all
of Fitness people because they will give
you tips and then you won't be scrolling
on your phone and you'll be like wow I'm
just sitting here on my phone when I
could be working out so definitely I
once I started following those Fitness
people I just felt more motivated just
because I saw them all the time because
we all are guilty of being on Instagram
like all the time the next tip that I
have for you guys is to reward yourself
so this one is honest with my personal
favorite so it is every single time that
you work out or you complete a workout
you put a dollar in the jar in a box
wherever in your room put yourself a
dollar and then before you know it
you'll have like twenty-five dollars and
you'll be able to save up to buy a new
workout outfits or to buy new sneakers
or whatever you name it but you really
want to work out so much more in a
dollar every time you work out is like
pocket change to you in the short run
but in the long term you'll be like wow
I actually worked out this many days
like that's incredible
and also cut yourself some slack if you
just do a couple stretches that day or
if you just do like a 50 minute
ab workout that still counts
not need to be a hour-long gym session
to reward yourself so any little thing
definitely helps motivate you so put a
dollar in the jar and then you will save
up to have like speakers or workout
clothes or whatever number six tip that
I have for you guys is to listen to
music when you work it out I kind of
touched on this in my last fitness video
but sworkit has some already uploaded
playlists from Spotify so you can plug
in your Spotify or listen to one of
their playlist on Spotify and it's like
really gets you in the mood and you will
only listen to it when you work out
those are your strict workout music's
songs musics I don't know and yeah I
just like it's built into the app it
just makes it a lot easier so what I'm
doing hardcore workouts like I love
listening to their playlists they are
like so good like push myself like to
the rhythm I'm like I don't know what
that is
I don't you just ignore that I'm not
doing that the gym let me know
number seven is another kind of drinking
and tip but it is to drink green tea I
read that you can't drink coffee or
green tea before you workout maybe like
an hour before it gives you that energy
boost that you need to follow through to
go to the gym and take motivated and
have energy to go to the gym but I feel
like I like coffee like I like vanilla
lattes and that really honestly gets me
pretty bloated and kind of like wake me
down so I don't recommend drinking
coffee before but I do recommend
drinking green tea because it does have
a little bit of caffeine it's so so
healthy for you and it will definitely
give you that energy that you need to
look workout the gym that's it number
eight is that I know so many of you guys
are just starting in Fitness including
myself are really really embarrassed to
go to the gym because you don't really
know what to do at the gym you have no
clue like what machines do what you
don't know how to use the machines you
don't know how you don't think that you
can do a proper ab workout without
stopping like 25 times
I get that I was totally there like me
and my friend would work out together
and literally we were both like the
dying after like five minutes and we
couldn't even lift our legs to do not
work out because they weighed like 500
pounds yeah we have been there everyone
has been there I am still there
sometimes so another tip I have
guys is to use a workout app I used to
work it obviously like I've been singing
and do it in your room because it tells
you step by step instructions like it
shows you a visual video of someone
doing the workout and you won't feel
embarrassed because you won't be with
anyone just find an empty space in your
room do the workout and then as time
progresses you can make your way to the
gym if you want or you can still do it
in your room but yeah I think that's
just a tip for you because so many
people are like I want to go to the gym
because I don't know what to do at the
gym all right well no more excuses you
can do it in your room so that was it
for this witnessed hacks video I hope
that you guys enjoyed this video and
give this video a thumbs up if you
didn't leave me any video requests in
the comments below I have a couple
videos coming up I don't want to share
them with you because yeah that's why I
got subscribe so now I subscribe to see
those I'm so excited for those I'm
excited for my spring break which is in
like two weeks
my spring break is in two weeks which is
absolutely crazy because it is still
cold outside it's actually not that gold
today we had a snow day on Monday and
then on Tuesday it was like 55 degrees I
saw some girl burning shorts and a
t-shirt like that is North Carolina
weather for you but I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and let me know what
you think and I love you guys so much
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
