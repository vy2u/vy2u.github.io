am filming a fitness video and I am so
excited because I'm actually going to
start filming a few fitness videos
throughout kind of the spring and I
think this ring is and we're all trying
to get our summer bodies and I have
these plans but I think I want to
continue these throughout the whole year
just because I have really started
getting into fitness and really started
working out and actually taking care of
my body and being aware of what I'm
putting in my body just being aware of
being healthy so making an active choice
to stay healthy because I know it is not
easy sometimes and I know most new
year's resolutions are always I want to
start going at the gym and being strong
and losing side pounds and all this
stuff and if you watched my New Year's
resolutions video I also was one of
those people his new year's resolution
was to go to the gym and I am proud to
say that I have stuck it to my new
year's resolution and I have been really
noticing such an improvement and the way
I feel the way I wake up in the morning
the way I view myself just everything
and obviously physical changes to my
body too so I am so happy with just
being able to stay motivated and even
though sometimes it's so easy to just
want to lay in bed so today I am showing
you guys my fitness routine and I am
kind of going to be a coach not really a
coach but just I want to be a motivator
for you guys and I have partnered with
this work it for this video and for the
next two fitness videos that I do
because I have been using this work it
since probably right January 1st I
downloaded a bunch of workout apps on my
phone so sworkit was one of the workout
apps that I downloaded and I started
using it because of how easy it is to
use I can't go to the gym if I go to the
gym and I just
look around and don't know what I'm
doing it so it's just good time to
having a personal trainer in your pocket
basically I just wanted to give you a
few tips at the end of this video on how
to keep this New Year's resolution and
if you have any questions in the comment
below please please please let me know
but I really want you guys to go on this
journey with me and on this challenge of
being fit so I will have everything
linked down below and yes they do in to
the end so that you can hear actual tips
but let's just get into my fitness
routine so first thing I do when I
workout is make sure that I have a glass
of water by my side I don't know how
some people workout without water but
you definitely need it to stay hydrated
not only is it refreshing but it's an
unhealthy if you go to the gym and you
workout and you don't have water so now
I'm just putting on my tennis shoes
because the tennis shoes are essential
I love Nike tennis shoes let me know
which brand you guys like because I'm
really getting into sneakers and I don't
know I'm just starting to wearing them
on a daily basis so I want to know what
you guys like and now I am at the gym
and I just grabbed a mat and I open my
sworkit app and I choose the stretching
first just because the stretching is so
important and I didn't realize this
until I started stretching and I
realized I got a lot less sore and a lot
less cramps the next day so I'm just
doing whatever the app tells me to do so
it started out with some neck stretches
now some arm stretches just getting
ready for the workout I only like
stretching for about five minutes just
because any longer than that I feel like
is not beneficial for me because I would
rather work out my body and normally
what I do when I go to the gym is I go
on the elliptical or anything that moves
my legs and my arms I don't like running
as much just because I like how this
incorporates arms and legs I like
getting a full body workout as much as I
can so I like incorporating almost every
muscle and every workout that I do and
then after that I just put my hair up I
normally go run or do the elliptical for
about 20 to 30 minutes and then I will
do some strength training
if depends how long I do my elliptical
machine but I'll do anywhere from 15 to
30 minutes of straight abs because that
is my main focal point and I like going
to the gym because with the circuit app
you can actually incorporate weights
with it so I'll do an exercise ball and
I love this app just because it tells me
what to do
so it will tell me exactly what to do
and it also demonstrates what to do so
if you're not sure how the form is or
anything like that
it will tell you after abs I normally
don't do 30 minutes but I'll do a quick
full-body workout and you can skip the
exercises to pick which one you like the
best and then I'll head over to the
weights just again no matter what it
tells me to do I can incorporate weights
with it so whenever it tells me to do
the chest presses or these dumbbell
presses I like actually getting some
dumbbells and then I'm done with my
workout I don't like going to too crazy
so that's it for my workout definitely
get some water and now I'm leaving the
chin bye guys so I hope you guys enjoyed
my fitness routine let me know what you
guys thought about it but now I just
kind of wanted to give you guys some
tips on the side and so one of my tips
is to follow workout accounts on
Instagram and on Pinterest there are so
many working up accounts you guys and I
don't follow too many of them because
that can also be overkill you don't want
your body like your confidence level to
decrease because you don't like like
like these models but it is a good way
to just stay motivated just know that
their bodies are not your bodies your
body is not their body and never will be
and that is okay because each individual
body is so beautiful and I am posting a
body confidence video coming up and that
is just something that I have had on my
heart for a long time because I have
seen so many girls go through just
eating disorders or just viewing
themselves as ugly or fat or anything
like that so that is just been put on my
heart and I am going to make a video for
you guys just a talking
I know for me if I follow them if I see
them I get really motivated it's not
like okay they're doing it I want to do
that I also have been really into like
Pinterest workouts challenges I did the
squat challenge or like half of it and
yeah it's own workout challenges I'm
really cool too
next tip for me is to clean out your
fridge of the junk food and try whenever
you're in the grocery store to make the
choice to have healthy food there so
there are so many healthy options you
can look up recipes on Pinterest and or
just on the internet and also just look
at the nutrition facts don't good things
with a lot of ingredients that you can't
pronounce don't get things with a lot of
calories per serving and high fats and
everything like that because that is not
good
so yeah just try making your fridge a
little healthier don't only have healthy
foods of course everything in moderation
but for me I try keeping my approach at
home healthy because I know when I go
out to eat with my friend whatever that
is or if I go to Starbucks or something
like that that is not healthy obviously
it's so I try kind of balancing it out
like when I go out that's my moderation
thing and then when I go home I try very
eating healthy and such as again my
number 3 tip is to have a workout
playlist and this playlist is not the
playlist that you play in your car it is
not the playlist that you listen to in
your room it is just strictly for when
you workout because I know music
motivates me and so if you have like a
bomb a workout playlist you are going to
want to listen to that and the only time
you can listen to it is when you workout
it's obviously discipline and you have
to follow it because you want to and
obviously so easy just turn on Spotify
and play that workout playlist when
you're just like in your room and
wanting to jam but if you make this
playlist specifically for when you just
want to work out then I feel like that
motivate you to workout just to listen
to that really really good music so
that's kind my a random tape that I
thought of because I have a playlist and
I just got it off of Spotify it's called
the power workout playlist but it's one
of those like pre-made ones but I only
listen to it when I work out and like I
listening to it like I will specifically
workout because I want to listen to
those songs the next tip I have for you
guys is very generic and it is to
schedule make time in your schedule
don't do it an hour before like who
maybe I'll work out today maybe I won't
because chances are you won't because
you won't want to that's natural people
don't want to work out it's not I mean
sometimes we do but like it's not
something like hell yeah I get to work
out today no it's it's just not so make
sure that you have it in your schedule
to work out and have a set time for it
and I am one of those people who needs
to schedule everything so that helps for
me but that is just a my advice for you
guys to actually get yourself to do it
so make sure that you guys download
sworkit though it is so so good I am
obsessed with that pop and and that is
the reason I have abs right now because
I do that ab workout all the time
typically I sound like an hour at the
gym like I said in the video an hour to
maybe an hour 15 maybe 30 minutes
sometimes really just depends on how
what I have going on that day but that
is kind of the gist of what I do in the
as you saw my fitness routine I will
change up the times of it sometimes
depending on how much I have like how
much had to do that day but that is
basically it so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video give it a thumbs up if you
did let me know if you guys are gonna do
this challenge journey a workout thing
with me and sworkit and yeah hope you
guys enjoy so thumbs this video up
follow me on all my social media I don't
really post any workout selfies but
maybe I'll change sometime I don't know
those are kind of like for me but I
don't know I've really been loving the
way my body looks so we'll see ya follow
me on all of my social media sites and
stuff and I'll see you there bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
