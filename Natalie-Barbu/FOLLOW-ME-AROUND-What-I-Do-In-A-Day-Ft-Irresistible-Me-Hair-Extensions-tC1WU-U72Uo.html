baby babe my kid I got the Joe
zag hey everyone its Natalie here and
today I'm filming a follow me around I
was gonna do morning routine but then
thought follow me around one would be so
much more fun and I've never really done
anything like this before so I basically
just took you around on my day showed
you that's what I did it's currently 8
o'clock right now and it is still light
outside
thank you it's summer seriously every
youtubers like favorite time is summer
because we can film later
ask anyone it's it's true anyways today
I'm showing you guys just around my day
and stuff like that and I showed you
guys how I got my hair cuz I mean if you
guys haven't noticed the difference um
it goes down to my waist it actually
goes down like almost to my butt like
there's there's a pretty big difference
but actually have extensions in and
irresistible me hair extensions
contacted me and they sent me them I am
NOT being paid to do this I'm literally
getting $0 all they did was send me the
extensions and said hey if you like it
make a video and if you don't then okay
and I tried it and I mean pretty safe to
say I love them I wore them to the
Wynwood Walls when I went check out my
Instagram if you guys want to see those
but yeah I got so many compliments on my
hair today and when I wore them the
other day and when I wore them the other
day this is my third time wearing them
and I am obsessed with them and they
match my color perfectly because I have
ombre I did not get brown I actually got
honey blonde and they not just alone I'm
just making sure no one's outside cuz
that'd be super awkward I actually got
the 20 inch is of honey blonde hair and
I got 200 grams I don't really know how
much 200 grams is to be honest which I
kind of sound like uneducated in that
sense but it is a lot I am using half of
the amount of hair they gave me I still
have the other half in the box upstairs
basically what I love about these is
that they stay on all day and this is my
first time ever trying extension so I
don't know how they compared to other
ones but I'm sure you can find so many
great video
just comparing it such as but this one
is just my first time experience with
extensions and I got them and I gently
curled my hair I like curled it a little
bit and then kind of left it to fall
throughout the day because I wanted to
just like natural waves and they held
the curl pretty well like they held it
like they can match my natural hairs
curl if I were you I would maybe put a
little bit hairspray in it just to keep
it but I never put hairspray in my
normal hair so that's why I didn't put
my spray in the extensions cuz I wanted
them to fall just like my hair fall
throughout the day but yeah they blend
super super well today was the kind of
windy outside and it didn't blow it like
you could still not see them in the wind
I could I have freaking I was like mom
hair she's like you're good like chill
okay so I really like them I'm just
showing you guys throughout the day how
long how they last and how they fall so
you can see I thought that was pretty
cool but yeah I have a coupon code for
you guys so I was little sent down below
and also the link down below for you to
check them out and let me know what you
guys think of this video and tell me
what if this looks like a typical day
for you guys or when you guys do it a
typical day let's just get started so
this video instead of me rambling all
day long and see what I did today
every day
my mind baby in time maybe I get you in
my ride
this is
L&amp;amp;T
this is what it looks like when you take
or when you see like a bunch of pictures
of people in one spot basically I'm
changing in the card ducking like this
so that no one can see me yeah that
getting right out I'm pretending like
all need a whole new outfit that is how
we why is it red very much
hey guys so we are at Queen's University
in Charlotte and I just wanted to give
an update on my hair and so it's like 97
degrees outside today and I'm wearing
fall clothes so it is very hot I'm
sweating and the hair also obviously had
heat to it and they've actually stayed
in like I haven't had to adjust that I
had to kind of like tie in one clip but
I think that's what I did it was an
honor
but yeah I mean they're staying and the
curl is saying it's falling just like my
natural hair is falling so I don't put
hairspray on it so I just they're
looking pretty good but yeah it is so
hot I'm like upper lip sweat right now
and that's like the last place it's like
I'm dying okay my mom kindly filming and
yeah so we're at cute little cafe and we
already had dinner like I showed you
guys and this seven o'clock about seven
o'clock okay seven o'clock and my
extensions are still in so that's a good
sign
yeah it's also not anymore and it's so
funny filming in public because everyone
