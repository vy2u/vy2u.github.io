hello everyone so today I am filming a
really really exciting video and it's my
very first first impressions video that
I have ever done on my channel so I'm so
excited and is for the Rihanna's new
beauty line fenty which unless even
living under a rock I feel like everyone
knows what fence he is if you don't it
is Rihanna's new makeup line and it has
40 shades of foundation for all types of
skin tones so that's why I it is so
amazing because no matter if you're
super light or super dark it kind of has
all the shades for every undertone every
color of every skin type so I think that
is awesome because a lot of foundations
mainly have a lot of light ones and then
not a lot of dark ones so this one is
has such a broad range and mostly it's
amazing so I'm here to try it
sodium is not sponsored I would love for
Rihanna needs a sponsor video but
unfortunately it's not I just want to
the bar today and picked some stuff out
so I will be doing a first impressions
of all of her makeup products and if you
are new to this channel please hit
subscribe down below follow me on all my
social medias and you can see all my
other videos that I post on Tuesdays and
Fridays so yeah let's just jump into the
makeup starting off with the primer and
I'm super excited to try this out it
looks really really pretty the packaging
on that her makeup is so so sleek and
nice which I really would not have
expected otherwise it is kind of like a
pink color just gonna apply this all
over my face if feels a little thicker
than most primer but it feels really
moisturizing definitely recommend
moisturizing your face before doing
makeup adding a time no matter how great
your what primer is but yeah this one
does feel really moisturizing and
unfortunately I don't think I'm gonna be
able to see the effect of the primer
until I go a whole day with it but as of
now it does make my skin feel soft it
does feel more like a moisturizer than a
primer because I think silicone which
I'm not sure if this primer has but it
doesn't have that like super super
smooth feeling like the Smashbox one
does or a lot of the other ones do but I
can't say any bad thing
about it I am most excited about and I
am about to try her foundation I got the
shade 240 which is a warm peach color so
there were so many people at Sephora
waiting to get color swapped so I
definitely recommend going now if you
can before they're all sold out but so
excited to try the Sun Dacian on I don't
have bad acne or any like blemishes or
anything and this is supposed to be a
full coverage foundation so I'm going to
let you guys know if I think it is too
much coverage look if you don't need
that much should be covered if this one
is right for you but yeah I love this
and tells me to shake it well so let's
see I am going to be applying this with
my Beauty Blender I did not buy her
Beauty Blender because I feel like it's
probably the same as all of the other
ones but I'm going to apply two pumps on
to my Beauty Blender
Wow this is definitely full coverage I
don't know if you guys can tell but it's
definitely definitely full coverage I
don't have much to be covered but I can
tell that it is completely like it's not
a foundation that feels like skin you
can I feel like it's one that like you
can tell you have makeup on but it
doesn't look like you have much makeup
on this is blending out so nicely I'm
actually incredibly impressed because I
normally don't wear full coverage
foundations but I do enjoy them
especially if I'm going for a night out
or for photos and today I actually do
have a function so that's why I'm doing
my makeup a little earlier to see how
this little lasts I'm gonna blend it
down my neck so the color I think is
perfect for me and if you guys can tell
on camera it does look like I have a
foundation on it's not like one that
feels like your skin but it looks really
really good that is one thing I will say
I definitely do think that this is a
hundred percent full coverage though
it's not like a buildable one like it is
very full coverage but if you are
looking for a full coverage foundation
this one is really nice like it blends
nicely and I don't see my pores which is
what I like because a lot of full
coverage foundations it gives it away
because you can see your pores this one
I don't see them and yet it is so full
coverage but it looks like my skin tone
which is really nice this is not like
makeup forever I think it's a little
buildable and it feels more like skin
this one you can tell you have
foundation on but it looks really really
really nice now I am going in with the
Fenske Beauty matchstick trio I was
super excited to try this one out what I
love about this is that it's magnetic so
it comes with three it's like a lighter
color bronzer and then a shimmer stick
and they're magnetic and they all stick
together like that I think
so cute so yeah definitely love the
concept of that and the packaging again
it's just adorable I love it and it's
like all the different sides are so you
can stick them like this shoe so I think
that was a really really smart thing
that Rihanna did I am using the color
caramel so I'm using the caramel color
and I'm going to be applying that to
where I would apply my bronzer and I'm
also not gonna apply powder on my face
or anything just yet because I want to
see how this foundation is on its own
without anything and for not having any
powder or any setting spray or anything
this looks amazing
it is definitely matte so that's why I
don't want to add a powder because I
feel like it would make it more matte
and I don't want that so I think I'm
just gonna end the makeup with a setting
spray but as of now I'm really happy
with how this is and I feel like I don't
even need concealer underneath my eyes
so now I'm applying this I'm going to
blend this out with a Beauty Blender I'm
going to use this as the base of my
bronzer and I'm gonna go in after this
with my actual bronzer stick in the tree
oh yeah this is a super light color I
feel like we're some this could look
like maybe a concealer this is supposed
to be one of these is supposed to be a
concealer but this was still darker than
my foundation so I thought this could be
good base for my bronzer next I'm going
to be using the color truffle which is
the dark brown color so let's see oh
yeah that's brown and this is the medium
color so let's see how this looks yeah
super blendable which is a good thing
because these are meant to be blended so
if they weren't blendable it would
definitely think that's a problem
yeah it looks super dark but once I
blend it out I think I'm gonna have to
add more it doesn't look that dark once
I blend it I basically just beat my face
with my beauty blender that's how I go
ahead and lets out a little bit more
more towards my temples and I'm gonna
add one line on my temples and also
align down my the sides of my nose
wow this blended so nicely you guys and
I am NOT a makeup artist or anything so
my makeup skills might not be that great
and it was still really easy for me to
blend I think you want to add a little
bit more of the brown
and now with these shimmer stick is the
color rum I am just going to apply a
little bit of that on the bridge of my
nose and a little on the highlight
and now I'm going to blend it out
oh I'm obsessed I'm literally obsessed I
like blending it towards the bronzer so
I'm trying to kind of bring the
highlight down and then the bronze are
up so that they kind of blend together
and then I'm blending it on my nose and
I'm going to apply a little bit on the
Cupid's bow a little bit on my chin okay
this looks amazing
Thank You RiRi thank you now I'm going
to be applying her highlighter so yes I
also applied highlight but I really
wanted to try this because I feel like
this is something that I have never seen
before so I really really wanted to try
out her gold highlighter this one is in
the color kilowatts and it is a
highlighter and its packaging is
everything seriously I love how
minimalistic everything is and this is
just like absolutely insanity to me so I
cannot wait to try this out I am going
to apply this with just my own bull bla
bla bla bla I'm going to apply the
highlighter with my own brush and so I
just have a fan brush and let's see oh
my gosh I'm so excited alright that was
a lot okay I'm gonna add some on this
side because that was just a lot and I
already have highlighter oh God okay
that was too much girl lit that out oh
the pigment oh my gosh I don't even need
to touch it anymore
I barely dipped my brush into there I'm
gonna try blending it out with a
blending brush because it is a little
too gold for my liking
you guys like super gold shimmer
highlight then this is definitely for
you but for me it's a little too much
gold but wholly pigmented okay trying to
blend it out
now kind of looks like I have like
glitter all over my face okay so I do
like that highlighter it is just two
super pigmented and I think it would
look better on darker skin tones because
it is gold and so I feel like for me I
have too light of a skin tone to rock
that gold of a highlight it looks good
on camera but in person it's a little
bit costumey so I'm gonna try to get
some off and blend it but regardless it
is a great great gold color and I think
it would look really really really good
as an eyeshadow which is what I will be
doing but yeah okay so after I blended
that out a little bit I think that's
like the most I'm gonna blend but wow ya
know it's very very I've never seen mint
in a highlighter I will give you that I
am trying her fancy gloss so I'm gonna
just apply this gloss on my lips it
looked absolutely gorgeous in the photos
so I cannot wait to try it all right
let's see I love this I love the
applicator it's a really really big like
kind of like a sponge applicator it's
not individual hairs which I like for
the gloss the gloss does feel very heavy
kind of like tacky like it's my if the
wind is gonna blow it's gonna stick in
my gloss but I feel like that's how most
glosses are I think it's a super natural
color and it feels amazing on my lips
okay I'm obsessed guys I did not think I
was actually gonna like this notes I was
planning on saying like ah it's
overrated whatever but it's so not
overrated
the foundation looks less cakey than it
did when I first put it on it now it
looks like skin you know when I was like
oh it doesn't look like skin it
literally looks like my skin right now
it blended in flawlessly with no powder
or anything I didn't even say 10 out of
frickin 10 I really do like the gloss
also I think the gloss is probably her
least like BAM product because I think
lip gloss is easy to find in a lot of
places but it is really nice
I'm trying to be like and I don't like
it that much but like I do I do that was
basically it for my first impressions
and now I'm going to tell you guys which
ones I like the best and which ones I
like the least my favorite product of
the FNC line from Rihanna Fenty Beauty
is the foundation I think that seriously
for being such a high coverage
foundation it looks amazing on your skin
and don't be alarmed if the first time
you put it on it kind of looks a little
cakey because after five minutes it will
blend gloriously second favorite would
probably be the trio stick I think it
was a good price it wasn't a great price
it was fifty four dollars but you've had
three like concealer like a lighter
color a dark color both matte and then a
shimmer stick which I thought was
beautiful and the shimmer stick alone
could have you could have used as a
highlight so I thought that was really
really nice my third favorite would have
to be the lip gloss I do really enjoy
this gloss I think it's amazing it just
feels good on my lips and it tastes kind
of good too so I really like it
and then my least favorite might be the
primer just because I haven't really
seen the effects of the primer yet and
it didn't feel like anything special but
it still was not bad but I feel like you
might be able to find a better one at a
cheaper price somewhere else and same
goes for the lipstick you can probably
find or a lip gloss you can probably
find a better one somewhere else or at
least a cheaper one but it is a really
really good gloss so if you're willing
to spend money on a high-end lip product
I do recommend this foundation
hands-down recommend it's not that
expensive it's I think it's about 34
dollars and there's plenty of other more
expensive ones out there but yeah thank
you Rihanna for gifting us with your
makeup because they're just amazing
thank you so much for watching this
video if you guys are buying the Fenty
line or I have any other products that I
didn't mention leave them down below and
if you guys want me to do another first
impressions on another video or another

love to do one because this is really
really fun and these were genuine first
reactions I just got this product like
