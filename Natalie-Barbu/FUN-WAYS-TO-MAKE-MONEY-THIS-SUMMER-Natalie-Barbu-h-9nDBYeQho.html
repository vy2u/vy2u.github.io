today I am filming a really exciting
video being a college student I feel
like I do travel a lot more than the
average college students all of my
friends and a lot of you guys actually
call it on my Instagram how can you
afford to travel so much and basically
for me everything comes down to saving
and making money and fun ways to make
more money just have some extra cash on
the side this video opera show you guys
at five different ways that you guys can
make money that you may have heard of
before maybe not on I tried to steer
away I can just like get a job like
obviously that's the way to make money
but I try to make it a little more
creative and than that so I hope that
you guys enjoy this video if you're new
here please be sure to subscribe for
comments below or subscribe in the
comments below if you're new here please
be sure to subscribe the button is down
below and give this video a thumbs up
and let's get into the video
the first way that I make money at you
guys haven't heard this before words in
my Instagram and my Twitter snapchat
literally everything I am always selling
my clothes every single season spring
summer fall winter I try to sell a good
portion of my clothes just because a lot
of things I did one style or I realize
the type of worn it in like five months
or something I'm probably and not going
to wear it again so I just like to get
rid of it I use to sell is Poshmark
and I want to give them a big thank you
for sponsoring this video I love them
I've done a previous video with them and
you guys got a ton of my clothes on
there so thank you guys so much part of
her is one of those apps where you can
sign your clothes and you can buy other
people's clothes I've been with them for
a few years and you look back on my app
extra on my for a while there's some
things on there Columbus's all time ago
I was funny to see what goes in and out
style that is the best way to sell
clothes for me because clothes are very
expensive and people are always trying
to kind of find cheaper ways to buy
expensive clothes so with hot sparkles
inside your designer clothes in your
style you're not so designer clothes you
can sell whatever you want and you price
it yourself I need to press on your
clothes probably that way to make money
in my opinion just because you put the
price and you know exactly how much you
bought it for and you're going to in
control of your own little store they
also give you the shipping label so that
you don't have to pay for shipping so
it's really really great app if you guys
want to download the app for free please
click on the link in the description
down below I will have that down below
make sure to check out my store because
I just actually posted a buggy mid 70s
on this patch I didn't seem that was
gritty on my closet but I've updated a
bunch of new clothing items on their
summer 3 guys so here's once you see
that totally can and also I'm doing you
can buy something from my stores and I
will write a camera in DOS and give it
to you guys and if you guys have talked
parks or please comment on comments it's
down below because I love shopping on
Poshmark
I love shopping just to buy like cheap
clothes so yeah let me know in the
comment below what your Poshmark is
decided way to make money is the basic
like babysitting dog-sitting
house-sitting
but with this app it actually makes a
lot easier so I hope you guys who ever
heard an app called next door it's
basically on a social media for your
neighborhood so you can just offer your
services on there but you can say like
hey I'm 19 years old of 20 years old 21
years old I'm here in town I love baby
spray your like you kind of little give
a little pitch about yourself you know
and then other family from the
neighborhood can see that and respond
like hey what's your number as well for
you to babysit or some people might post
on there hey I'm looking for a
babysitter and it's all in your
neighborhood so they do it by our phone
number so they can make sure that you
live where you live and it's just your
neighbors so I think it's a great way to
offer kind of your services in your
community
so you're not kind of like going across
town to babysit so I think that's a
great great app and I've definitely sick
for some time it's kind of fun just
scrolling through it and like seeing
what people are offering or single or
saying a lot of the old phone
mainly assault no kids are on there like
hey what's up guys no it's not like one
of those were you like post status or
whatever so it's kind of funny it's
going through and stable adults are
saying that's the neighborhood I doesn't
answer it out there that I'm available
for babysitting it's about to face
setting is such a great way to make
money hammocks are these people already
kind of know you or your family because
they aren't your neighbors so you're way
more likely to get someone's and like
CARICOM or something like that they say
that I have to for you guys if something
I recently did it is to sell your
college dorm rooms items so there's a
pun an eco problem that you know going
to college or going into moving into an
apartment or moving into another room if
you just sell your old dorm room stop
people by that is if XF is so expensive
and if you want to read that great way
to make money and yet still redecorate
so I'm planning on redecorating my room
next year so I'm actually gonna sell a
bunch of my dorm room stuff and I'm sure
post it on Facebook be like hey does
anyone want to get this just for close
friends because I think if they trust
you and they like know your style and
stuff they're way more likely to buy it
from you because it gives cute it's
still in the condition and put furniture
or like like art decor or something like
that and so I think social media is a
great place to put that and you can
damage hard for your price however much
you want and then you can redecorate
your room or have that money for the
size you travel like I do the next one
it's kind of a classic one but I feel
like people forget because once summer
starts you know wind Express cool at all
but my biggest thing is sell your old
textbooks so I have a ton of old
textbooks actually laying around in my
room from years and years so will come
from my freshman year you know from high
school I have some that like so much
books that we have to read for class and
chances are people below you people
younger than you or you need those exact
same textbooks if they're not going to
want to put $150 for a textbook so you
can rip it out to them and then have
them give it back to you at the end if
you're friends with them or something
like that and you can keep doing that
and make way more money than the
textbook cost or you can just sell it
for a cheaper price and then make that
money
anything that's for whatever you want
but I think all your textbooks don't
forget to sell them just
somewhere you still gotta think about
that because those are expensive and it
doesn't get you a lot of money
also if you're in trifle and don't have
Texas to sell at college students to be
thankful you're spending that much money
on a textbook but I know you guys have
other things like you guys had old books
that you have to read for class and you
can definitely sell those to even for
cheaper than Amazon or Barnes and Nobles
that can make you a little sign money so
I think that is a great idea don't
forget about school just again we're on
summer break guys still think about ways
to make the next one I thought was a
very fun one and I have definitely done
it is to take out a hobby that you have
and charge people for it so whether that
is photography guitar people for
portraits or anything like that people
love taking pictures of themselves and
if you just charge in like 20 bucks per
session
that's so much cheaper than like a legit
photographer you're getting practice on
them and they're getting $20 worth of
pictures which item gets kind of a
win-win for everyone so definitely do
that display it out social media
advertising on social media you can even
advertise that on next door but like
that is something that I think because
that might make you money so love
getting pictures of themselves since it
is summer a lot who are asking for
graduation pictures senior pictures so
you can definitely make money doing that
another service that I would think is to
do makeup if you are the one in physical
great at doing makeup charge people to
do their makeup like hey I'm offering
only twenty dollars to do your makeup 15
dollars
turn around rip up your little you want
something on how professional you are or
how much people will actually willing to
pay but if you just want a little extra
cash and you also want practice with
your hobby then I think that is a great
way to do that so it's prompts are
coming up I feel like those kind of
hatched but some probably still be in
May but props coming over and social
event or your chances or anything like
that and be like hey I'm offering the
service for this much if you guys want
to get your makeup done by me show a
couple of example pictures there you do
it yourself and then I promise you will
get people people love getting their
makeup done also with hair you can do
the same thing another thing that what
people don't think about with it's also
picking up a hobby but if you're really
good at taking pictures or like really
like social media I know it's kind of
like weird to be good at social media
but you can look at local boutiques or
local restaurants around you and ask
them if you can run their social media
sites and obviously ask them for a
little bit of compensation but just be
like hey I've noticed that your social
media can be better they honestly nicely
come prepared come with a pitch saying
this is everything I can do I can
probably gain I can make sure that your
followers gain this summer
let me like have at it able to try and
then see what they say social media is
the new form of advertising you guys you
don't believe me we look around look at
yourself with you would you rather buy
something because you saw in a magazine
and at 4 on the Billboard or would you
rather buy something because your
favorite percentage to tokyo-based look
on Instagram and they look really cute
all the way running my dad systems
Instagram is busy or this summer because
my dad doesn't have one against his own
business moment what are you doing like
you need to have an Instagram like
that's just I feel like for me that's
kind of the best way of marketing so
yeah so see I'm doing something like
that
you guys can totally do something like
that and I'm sure a lot of you guys
never thought of that but if you just go
up to a local can't pitch from yourself
you're good
so I get to my video I brilliant for you

out harsh mark in the downbar below i
