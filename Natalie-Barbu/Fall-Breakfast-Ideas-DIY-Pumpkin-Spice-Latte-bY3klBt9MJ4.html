I am coming to you guys with a DIY
breakfast ideas plus how to make a
pumpkin spice latte which was inspired
by Starbucks right at your house because
I know how much money you guys spend on
the Starbucks and I decided to and make
it at home for you I decided to show you
guys to breakfast ideas and one
do-it-yourself Starbucks drink so the
two breakfast ideas are going to be a
really yummy sandwich a smoothie but
before we get started I want to let you
guys know that this is actually a collab
video and it's a collab with my friend

thank you but anyways um yeah if you're
not subscribed subscribe give it a
thumbs up this is one of the smoothies
that I made and it's so good now without
further ado let's just get started in
the video for the first breakfast idea
I'm doing an Apple Gouda grilled cheese
and you're just gonna need some bread
Gouda cheese a green apple or the apple
of your choice and I cut my Apple into
slices and then you're just gonna turn
your stove on it to make the grilled
cheese I like putting butter when I make
sandwiches as the my anti stick spray
but you can do whatever you want like
Pam or whatever you're just gonna take
your bread and then you're gonna put
your slices of cheese on it really
really simple and then in between the
slices of cheese you're gonna put your
apple slices you can totally customize
it anyway that you want so if you want
more cheese than Apple or you want more
Apple than cheese or you want to put way
more layers than I did all up to you I
love cheese so I like putting a lot of
that and the Apple gives it such a nice
crunch I know this isn't really a
breakfast sandwich but I thought because
I had Apple in it it totally could work
as a breakfast sandwich and like people
make like egg and cheese sandwiches so
instead of egg it's Apple but yeah then
you're just gonna put it on the stove
and wait for the cheese to melt and the
bread to get toasty and it is so so good
you guys the butter in the background
looks pretty gross just wait for that
bread to get pretty toasty and I liked
cutting it into two and it was just one
of the greatest things I've ever had the
next thing is gonna be the pumpkin spice
latte so you'll need coffee or espresso
pumpkin puree pumpkin pie spice your
sweetener of your choice and almond milk
or any milk that you like then you're
gonna put a cup of water into a pan on
the stove this is gonna be I think on
pretty high heat you're gonna put your
cup of sweetener in then you're gonna
put your pie pumpkin pie spice in and
then you're gonna put your pumpkin puree
in this is all just basically gonna sit
there and you're gonna mix it all
together this is how you make the
pumpkin spice latte syrup so the syrup
that they use this is what's in it
so you whisk this all up I used one of
my whisks and it looks pretty gross but
then you bring it to a boil once it's
all mixed in and then you just leave it
simmering for three minutes so I have
all of the ingredients now so you're
gonna put your coffee and your desired
mug obviously make it kind of a cute one
you know then you're gonna put your
syrup into the mug and next thing you're
gonna put the milk into the mug and then
you're just gonna mix it all up together
and to make it look really pretty you
can put some whipped cream on top and
then result some caramel syrup or any
syrup of your choice on top I just think
this makes it look like picture worthy
and especially with my candles in the
background it just looked so so good
like tell me that you would not eat that
up right now the next one is a pumpkin
smoothie and I've actually never seen
this before so I was really excited to
make it but you just forget a banana
some pumpkin puree some agave I just
sprinkled it in and then at pumpkin pie
spice and then some almond milk or any
milk of your choice again like I said I
just really love almond milk and I added
some coconut water and my mom said it's
a really good in smoothies so honestly
that's the only reason I added it and
then you're gonna get some vanilla
yogurt or Greek yogurt and then mix that
in there as well and then put some ice
just because it's a smoothie and not a
milkshake
then you're gonna blend it and that is
literally it it is so good you guys I'm
drinking it this morning again and this
is definitely my go-to breakfast
smoothie
