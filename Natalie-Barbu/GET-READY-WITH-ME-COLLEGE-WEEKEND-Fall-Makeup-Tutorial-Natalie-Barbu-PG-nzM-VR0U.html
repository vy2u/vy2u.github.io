doing a get ready with me I decided to
do this just because I wanted to film a
video today and I didn't know what to
film so I figured this is the easiest
way so you get ready with me for a fall
day and this shirt is not flattering on
me in this camera angle but we're gonna
make it look good because we're gonna
make our face in our hair and it's gonna
look nice and this turtleneck is gonna
become more flattering you guys are new
to my channel please be sure to
subscribe I basically do videos like
this or I'll do a lot of college related
videos christmas is coming up so we'll
be doing vlogmas on my vlog channel so i
would love it if any of you guys did
subscribe to that subscribe over here
and make sure to follow me on Instagram
and all of that good stuff because
that's how you guys will be able to keep
up with me before this intro is super
long cuz I know how much everyone hates
those I'm just gonna get right into the
makeup and you guys still just kind of
chill get ready with me grab a seat get
ready with me yourselves and watch this
while you're doing your makeup you know
so yeah that's that's what we're gonna
be doing it's gonna be a very very
casual video today I have a long day
ahead of me I'm going out tonight so I
am going to prime my face I'm using a
Laura Mercier radiance primer and yeah
just because I need my makeup to last
over 12 hours so or for about 12 hours
we're gonna be putting this all over I
want to be super super glowy today so
I'm going to be doing a strobe cream and
putting that on the high points of my
cheeks I've not used a sharp cream in a
long time but I miss it normally just
use it in the summer and I don't know
why I don't really transition it to
winter because I feel like that's when
you need it most
all right now I'm using a Marc Jacobs
foundation this one I have not used in a
long time but I kind of want to try it
out so I'm just going to use this on a
beauty blender and put two pumps and
beat my face with it basically that's
what I'll be doing and when I apply my
Laura Mercier concealer and I'm just
gonna apply that with my finger and I'm
gonna put that all underneath my eyes
and I like applying it with my finger
the best because it warms it up
underneath your eyes so it like melts it
into your skin and this concealer is
super creamy we can't even see it really
it like blend so easily towards the end
of the week when I need to catch up on
my sleep I definitely put a lot more
concealer on and then after I blend it
out with my finger I'm gonna press it
into my skin with a Beauty Blender I
love after I put my foundation on it the
complexion how it's so even and nice
this is literally like my favorite part
because it makes me feel like my skin is
so nice and like even now and tan and
all right I'm gonna go in with my Laura
Mercier translucent powder and I'm gonna
put that underneath my eyes to bake my
face and while I'm doing this I want to
know more about you guys so let me know
how you guys found my channel how long
you've been a subscriber
yeah just like what made you stumble
across this video and if you guys have
your notifications on that'd be nice
because YouTube is not really notifying
you
when I post videos I feel like if that's
the case let me know but we also if you
guys could just hit that little Bell
because then you guys will get a
notification the second I post and if
you're already a notification squad then
let me know that too so I can give you
guys a huge shout out because that would
mean so much to me I just kind of put
the translucent powder once I'm done
putting it underneath my eyes kind of
everywhere else and pressing it in so
not baking the other part but just
making sure my face it's a little more
matte on the other areas and just
keeping the excess underneath my eyes
I'm gonna move on to the eyes now and I
always start with my eyebrows so I love
doing the precisely my brow pencil and
I'm gonna be brushing out my brows and
just filling them in and making them a
little darker and a little more
structure
now for eyeshadow make sure you prime it
your eyes primer is just like a huge
step of my makeup process in my eyes I'm
gonna be using this new palette called
the persona identity palette I got this
set to me and I absolutely love it
never heard of the company before then
but I'm really excited to try it out so
I'm just gonna go in with you kind of
like brownish light brown color and
blend that into my crease I'm basically
doing it everyday makeup tutorial cuz
pretty much do the same steps every
single day so I'm gonna be adding the
brown and adding it to my crease and
just blending it out and I will be
adding a gold color and applying that
all over my lid this is such a pigmented
and pretty gold I'm obsessed with it I
think it's so nice
just let me applying that all over my
lid after those aren't both all over my
lid I take a crease brush and I'm gonna
apply kind of like a hurt but like a
burnt orange into my crease and focus
that on the outer part of it
after that I'm taking it back to my
blending brush and going in with the
first color and also mixing it with a
lighter color and blending all the
colors together because I don't want any
harsh lines or anything like that for
the look I'm going for so it's just good
to blend everything out and make sure
that it's all even and not just like a
giant bay a bunch of like colors or like
cut crease or whatever because that's
not the look I'm going for pretty sure
like the key to good makeup is blending
because no matter what you do something
wrong you can blend it enough it will
look fine I'm just going in with a
winged eyeliner my classic look and
using a liquid liner and just winging it
out
and then I'm gonna go in and line my
bottom lashes with a black eyeliner I
just like doing this an outer portion of
it and now I'm going to be brushing off
the translucent powder and going into my
contour oh wait I forgot mascara that
would be bad if I forgot that I'm gonna
use a mascara to curl firstly I curl my
lashes and then I'm gonna apply a
waterproof mascara because my eyes have
been wandering like crazy lately and I
don't really know why so waterproof is
the only way to go for me or else I
won't have mascara all down my face I'm
gonna start out with using fenty by
Rihanna and I'm gonna be using her
highlighter and I am first going to be
applying it just on the highlights of my
cheek and kind of like a line and just
on my cheekbones where I want to see as
you can see it's super pigmented and not
blend it out but we're gonna do that for
both cheeks we're gonna apply it on our
nose pin lip and now we are going to
blend I don't want to blend this out as
much as you can
the good thing I noticed about Rihanna's
makeup is it's super blendable so kind
of where you put it is fine even if it
looks like a straight line because look
at how easy it is to blend out look at
what I was - compared to what it is now
after that I'm gonna go in with the
bronzer so we kind of worked backwards I
apply that just on the high the cheek
might going to apply it just on my
cheekbones I'm going to try starting at
very high and not bringing it low and
I'm just going to blend it to be lower
and now with powder highlight I'm going
to go back over where I went with the
fenty and a big fan brush this is gonna
set it and it's also gonna break it up
from the bronzer and the highlighter
that we blended together and now with my
favorite blush the NARS one I'm going to
be applying that to the apples of my
cheek and blending it out
making sure everything is blended out
with this so this is just gonna make
sure if you have any lines that you want
the LED bed it's gonna do that for you
as for lips I'm just going to be
applying my NYX metallic gloss and I'm
just going to be applying a little bit
of it I don't mind my lips to get
chapped so that's why I'm doing more of
a gloss
and that is the finished look so here is
my finished makeup look you guys I'm
about to go do my hair and then get
ready for the day but this is it for the
makeup I really hope that you guys
