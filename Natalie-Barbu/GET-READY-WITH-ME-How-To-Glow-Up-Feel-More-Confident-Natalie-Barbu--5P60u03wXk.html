ever looked in an intro oh my gosh it's
really purpose of this video it is how I
go from this ratchet south to this
insert clip of me looking much better
than this hopefully because I haven't
obviously done that yet so if you guys
are wondering what this video is it is a
get ready with me for how I get ready
when I kind of like blow up slash like
photo shoot ready anything like that I
really want to take you guys with me
from top to bottom how I just like look
better cuz right now I'm all sweaty and
gross so I just thought I wanted to do
like a whole like literally every single
step of the way you know I'm filming on
my blog camera because I want to do more
like like main channel videos but
filming them vlog style so let me know
if you guys like this I'll be showing
you guys how my whole body gets ready
how do I do with makeup my hair cuz you
know and definitely needs work I know I
know
also I just got back in the gym so
that's why I'm sweaty and like I don't
just like wake up like dripping sweat
that'd be really nasty I would be
concerned about that yeah video is
partnered with Yoast products and I am
pro doing with them on the shaving cream
and it is hands-down my favorite shaving
cream I've used them before I like
partnered with them on this video like I
just emptied out my first bottle like I
already finished that and then I'm
partnering with them now but it's
seriously amazing so I will be showing
you guys how I use that the benefits
perks all that stuff it's the back it
makes my legs feel so soft and I have
like so like eczema on it like I don't
have like horrible eczema but I
definitely get eczema sometimes on my
legs I get a really really bad red bumps
and this shaving cream does not give me
that whenever I shade was out of shaving
cream though you guys don't wanna like
it's like I have like red bumps all over
my legs it feels like I didn't shave
it's nasty I know but this shaving cream
literally makes my legs feel so soft you
guys and I'm gonna be showing you guys
how I get ready and I just want to thank
them for partnering with me on this
video and if you guys want to check out
any of their products I'm gonna have
everything linked down below you guys
know the drill but this angle is like
not
neither like is this better now there's
not much you can do so I am about to go
and wash my body because I'm actually
going to get my hair blown out I
normally don't get my hair blown out I
think I've gotten like three blowouts in
my entire life besides like it when I
get a haircut
so I normally don't get my hair blown
out but because I just got eyelash
extensions yesterday I got a refill
which by the way they did a horrible job
and going back tomorrow to get them
fixed because it like doesn't look like
I'm Alexandra decides the point because
I cannot get my eyelashes way I didn't
want to like do a full body shower so
I'm just gonna wash my body then I am
going to do my hair and then I'm gonna
shave my legs on the tub because I don't
want to be in the shower for too long
just in case my eyelashes get wet and
then they like all fall out because that
would not be good at all I am already
looking slightly better I just watched
my body and put on an outfit just to go
to the hair salon so I'm wearing these
ripped jeans and the sink table it's
actually kind of cute I wasn't planning
on like looking cute but hey I am
running late though I'm already probably
gonna be five minutes late so I gotta go
but I will show you guys one sign that
the hair salon and once they see this
thank god I worked with that they got
can we also just take an appreciation
for the hairdressers that let you be on
your phone and read a magazine and not
talk I am such an introvert but thumbs
up if you guys feel the same way or
comment if you guys just like chatting
with everyone because I'm definitely the
opposite if you can't
just got my hair blown out it looks so
good this is what I needed to feel
glamorous so thank you to the blown away
bar in Raleigh it looks so much better
than that mess that was on my hand at
that bird's nest that was all my head
part of the whole getting ready process
from the head to toe is shaping my legs
and I'm just good morning guys I haven't
shaved my legs in a week so they're not
ready so I really got to shape them I'm
just gonna shave my legs in the tub
because I already showered this morning
but what is that don't know what that is
okay
these legs need to get soft they are not
soft at all right now it's actually kind
of disgusting this is the real life of
hats again this is how to glow up you
guys
my legs feel so soft right now you guys
I always put lotion on afterwards I
really don't even feel like I have to I
but I really don't feel like I have to
just because my legs don't feel like
rough or anything and I am being 100%
honest with you guys every time I shave
literally makes me break out in red
bumps so I'm really happy that I found
one that doesn't make me break out and
red bumps and I think the reason why is
because it feels more like a lotion it
doesn't really feel like a shaving cream
necessarily like it's not like one of
those that foams up which I personally
don't like because it clogs my rights
are more when they do foam up like that
Yost great thing it is a unique skin
friendly super smooth shave cream and
it's more sensitive skin it's a guys why
I think I don't freak out in bumps and
why my legs feel like they already have
lotion in them because this does have a
protective moisture barrier so it
actually holds the moisture in your legs
for way longer than any other like
shaving cream does cuz normally shaving
creams are just supposed to like make it
go on smoother but this one actually
like moisturizes your legs like a lotion
would it has aloe Wild Oats lavender
which is nice so it's obviously not
gonna make you break out from that
because I know some people are more like
allergic to some certain fragrances but
this one does not have any it only has
skin of friendly ingredients I'm not
gonna make me break out with my eczema
or anything like that but yeah my legs
feel super super soft and I'm wearing a
dress today so I definitely needed to
shave my legs like that was like a
no-brainer like I had to see my legs
anyone else when you shave your legs you
just want everyone to feel them because
that's how I am that's me right now
tonight I don't have anyone in my
apartment but if I did I'd be like ooh
feel my legs they feel so soft thank you
okay you guys so adjacency I'm already
starting to look a lot better I also
want to know what you guys think of this
like vlog style type get ready with me
normally I may not take you through like
head-to-toe
whole day but I had a lot to do today so
I was like I might as well film the
video about it that's what I'm we're
doing here so now we are sitting down to
do my makeup so this is me without
makeup right now so I understand show
you guys the makeup that I think makes
me feel my best and my most confident so
we are going to just start off with that
I really play guys enjoyed this video -
I don't know how many times I'm gonna
say it's just something different on my
channel so yeah I feel like it's just
more me - so I like being more myself
with you on my main channel so I hope
that you guys like it I'm just gonna
start off with a primary this is an
instant scanner booster from Pixy it's
just this rose flash bomb so any primer
works honestly I haven't found any
primer that I'm like obsessed with they
just all kind of like and do their job
so after the primer I am using this
ludmil Oceana
so it's loose go lotion from L'Oreal it
is my favorites
it just goes underneath your makeup and
it gives you kind of like the natural
highlight so I've been super into
illuminizer zhh and anything that has to
do with making you look more glowy that
has definitely been a look for me
and then after that I'm taking my sin T
Beauty Foundation and applying it with a
Beauty Blender
and I actually have a question for you
guys can you guys let me know any of
your favorite foundations they don't
have to be full coverage but just like
any favorite foundation of yours because
I have been using the Fenton one for a
while and I like it but because I love
makeup I just get bored and I want to
try new things so let me know your
favorite foundation that you use so I
can go out and buy one because I'm just
bored with this one I absolutely love it
so I don't know why I'm bored with that
but for makeup tutorials I use it all
the time and I just want to have
different ones for like in different
looks or different occasions if you guys
know what I'm saying
so yeah just come down below your
favorite foundation now I'm going in
with my NARS concealer and I am just
putting this underneath my eyes I feel
like whenever I'm filming or wanting to
look good I definitely need under-eye
concealer just to hide the fact that I
like don't sleep but and then I put a
little bit on the tip of my nose and on
my forehead to brighten me up oh yes
girl or glowing up that's the video glow
up this is how you blow up
now I'm taking a translation trip-trap
above that and taking a translucent
powder from Laura Mercier and I am just
applying this underneath my eyes this is
so I don't crease I'm not baking it I'm
just like setting it and dusting it
underneath my eyes because we don't got
time to bake I'm sorry but like I'm just
in a rush as for highlighter I am going
in with this Marc Jacobs dewdrops and
I'm just gonna apply a little tiny drop
like that much on my Beauty Blender and
I'm gonna put it where I apply my
highlighter and this is just gonna give
me like I really really like your
doesn't glow
of the glow but this gives I feel like
I'm like a goddess or something with
this uh I'm going in with Urban Decay's
new bronzer this is beach bronzer it's
their new collection so pretty it is
called the bronze bronzer very very
creative A+ for creativity it just
blends so nicely with the highlighter
and I'm putting it on my forehead and
blending it into my hairline so it looks
like I got hit with the Sun even though
I haven't seen the Sun and HS you guys
now I am taking the anastacio glow kits
I haven't used this and so long but I
really want to use this color right here
it's the summer color it gives me more
of like a gold like a light champagne
gold color so I'm gonna be using that
just to sweep over once the highlight
because I don't want to look greasy so
I'm just gonna lightly dust lightly dust
and then I'm putting this on my nose as
for blush I have been a cult favorite
NARS orgasm user for years so I'm just
gonna dust that on my cheeks just a tiny
tiny bit just to add some color
as for the brows I'm gonna go in with my
benefits brow precise of my brow pencil
and fill them in so I already have dark
eyebrows but I just want to fill them in
and shake them more I'm assuming you
guys in okay I feel like I look like
someone with my brows this dark so
comment below who you guys think I look
like with my brows being like this dark
and filled in because I feel like I feel
like it's like Laurel from like How I
Met Your Mother
or How I Met Your Mother Laurel from how
to get away with murder that's the word
I was looking for I am just applying the
same bronzer I put on and I'm just gonna
put that in my crease just to give us
some dimension but like sucks that I
can't put makeup on my eyes yet as for
lips I'm going to be applying this matte
color it's super super pretty this is in
the shade modesty and I'm gonna be
applying that on my lips and then doing
the Too Faced lip injections and make my
lips look bigger and glossy err
here is the final look you guys I really
hope that you guys liked it it's super
super simple but this isn't just what
the makeup that I wear that makes me
feel my best and my most confident and I
in no way want to say that you need to
have like blown out hair and makeup on
and shave the legs and silky smooth legs
to look your best or to feel your most
confident that is just how I feel my
most confident and how I feel like I
look my best but this isn't no way of
saying that like you're not beautiful if
you don't do this cuz I know that's not
what this is about that is not what we
are promoting here this is just my
personal take on it and if you guys want
to try anything out that I do then this
is just what I do we are all here to
love and empower one another not to
compare it so yeah I just had to throw
that out there I also want to give a
huge shout out to EOS for sponsoring
this video and for giving me the most
amazing silky smooth legs seriously

soft and I really wish that you guys
could feel them but that would be a
little bit creepy

get bumps like I do this one does not
give me bumps you guys saw my legs and
I'm about to go take pictures after this
