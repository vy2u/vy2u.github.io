nice weekend in Los Angeles you know
totally not filming this at all
so now when I actually wake up basically
what I do is I like to sleep with the
blinds open just so i can wake up bright
and early and i just head over to the
sink which is the very first thing that
I do whatever I'm in a hotel because
hotel beds are kind of comfy but I don't
long to stain them as long as I do my
own med then I just put my hair up with
a ponytail elastic and I just get right
to my skin carotene so I use Garnier's
blackhead eliminating scrub and i really
love all of Garnier's products it's
going to look like i'm kind of sponsored
by them but i swear i'm not i bought
these all at CVS with my own money and
yeah so I just Rutt wipe my face wash my
face you know the usual and I pat dry my
face just cuz rubbing it kind of
irritates it and I heard that padding it
is better so you know gotta listen to
the magazines then I brush my teeth so
pretty self-explanatory hey guys there's
me brushing my teeth very interesting
then i use my gardening moisturizer this
is actually a night cream and i only
brought it with me because i only wanted
to bring one so i just used it in the
morning but i would recommend just using
that at night then I checked the weather
and I see lemme hot coals kind of
determine my output and since I already
pre packs obviously I kind of had an
idea of what the weather was but you
know just got a double check then on to
my mega 15 so basically what I do is I
just layer a light foundation and I
apply that with my PT blender and then i
conceal any of my blemishes I have a
full makeup routine that I do every
single day if you want to watch that i
will move sat down below but yeah then I
just conceal underneath my eyes just
because when I'm on vacation I
exclusions
cake is a tongue-tied typically take a
lot of photos so I just want to make
sure that I look my best but let's say I
was in a tropical resort I probably
would not be wearing makeup then I just
powder my face again because it kind of
sunny in California even though was it
hot I just didn't want my face makeup to
melt talk then I apply a bronzer and I
apply that mainly all over my face just
to kind of get my whole face a bronze
look but mainly kind of on my cheekbones
then I apply this on the highlights of
my cheek or highlights of my face and
then I just my aesthetic spray so yeah
pretty self-explanatory then I'm going
to prime my eyes with my mac paint pot
that is by far my favorite favorite
eyeshadow primer ever and then I just do
a really simple I love whenever
application because I don't feel like
going all out so I just kind of blend it
a light brown color into my crease and
then just apply to a shimmery color onto
my lid after it to kind of make it a
little more cut fries and just so it's
not totally blend together and then I
just align my upper lash line and that
is basically all I do for like a shadow
and I curl my lashes and apply my
mascara I actually got a new mascara
that i'll show you guys in a hall but
yeah I've been using covergirl for now
and then i'm done with the makeup so it
takes me like 10 minutes to get ready in
the morning and then I kind of like Oh
what do I wear pajamas you know and then
BAM I'm dressed it happened that fast
you guys fast in this video that's how
long it takes me to get ready not really
but anyways my dress is from brandy
melville my hat is from free people and
my shoes are actually I'm not sure Oh
either topshop so yeah my bag is from
Windsor so I really love just dressing
up in complications because again I like
taking a lot of pics and yeah I just
like looking cute as such as some in LA
and I went to earth cafe and it was
amazing guys yeah make sure you're
subscribed to my channel if you want to
