hey guys what's up it is Natalie here
and today I am showing you guys a prom
makeup hair and dress video I'm so
excited to show you guys this because
last year this video is my most viewed
video so let's get this one to more than
the last one that would be awesome but
yes and you can watch last year's two to
just get a little more inspiration but
this year's I decided to do a little
different I want it to make it more
relaxed and because I realized that
normally everyone is one year of wanting
prom to be like sequins and perfect hair
and perfect makeup and all that like
just like being like Cinderella and then
normally the second time around you
kinda just tired of that and you just
want to be more casual not too casual
because still prom but one of those like
I'm not trying too hard but like really
but you know what I'm saying
little less toned down so this is the
toned more toned down look and it's
definitely if you you can make it more
like a more black eyeshadow and shimmer
you want to make it more like ba-ba-boom
I don't know add maybe like a braid or
some like hair piece to make the hair
cooler to make sure you give this video
a thumbs up follow me on instagram for
all that's going on in my life and this
picture will be goes up on instagram but
i am not going to promise you because i
in college in college but I just love
feeling like prom makeup tutorials
because when I like to prom I think I
watched maybe over a hundred just to get
ideas so I love doing this and if you
guys are going to a sorority formal turn
D formal this could also be for you or
just anything I am wearing the dress
that I'm going to show you guys - my
boyfriend's formal so it really doesn't
need to be just for prom but yeah let's
hook it into this video because I talk
too much
as for my hair goes I kind of wanted to
explain how I got the curls with this
straightener and I think this
straightener is really good for getting
curls just because it gets hot on both
sides so that is what you need because
if you just have a straightener that
gets hot on one side you are not gonna
get the curls so yeah I set the
temperature to 370 you can go higher or
lower if you have a straightener that
adjusts but basically what I did was I
just grabbed a piece of hair and then I
flipped it as you guys are about to see
I just flipped it kind of awkwardly
honestly like twice and then you
basically just straighten it and release
it and as you can see like the steam is
coming out of the straightener you
really want one that gets pretty hot and
also adjustable but this one is not
gonna damage my hair because it is
ceramic so yeah it's not gonna damage it
but yeah so I did that and then I didn't
show you the whole thing because it's
literally so repetitive and then again
to the top I just did the same thing and
then at the end when you twist it with
your finger that's how you kind of hold
the curl and kind of finish it off
sometimes if hair is a little stubborn
at the top you can like go over it with
a straightener but that is the final
look again it's a lot more relaxed and I
hope you guys like it yeah
so I hope that you guys enjoyed this
video make sure you give it a thumbs up
make sure that you are following me on
everything let me know when your prom is
who you're going with what you're
wearing how you're doing your makeup
literally every single detail of your
prom I want to know below so please
please please let me know some problems
are in like March and then other proms
are in like July I don't even know who's
in school in July but yeah they'll let
me know when yours is and I love you
guys so it'll be like yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
