around the airport so it's kind of get
ready with me leaving Mexico I was going
to feel and morning your team just for
Mexico but then I realized all I do is I
get up and I go to the pool I don't put
my phone I don't have anything else
literally just get up and go to the pool
so signing off to do that I decided just
to do an airport one because there's
more involved in it and I was also
really sick today I want to film so I
did not decide to go so I hope you guys
enjoyed this one super me ten times
better anyways but Mexico was so much
fun I went to Cancun I already posted a
video yesterday of me try Mexican candy
with my little sister and a little bit
of my little brother in the video be a
go check that out it's so funny I think
is like hilarious I crack up watching it
but I don't know maybe it's just me yeah
so go check out Steph's channel make
sure you thumbs this video up if you are
excited for more about Mexico videos

which is kind of this summer I have a
lot of videos coming up you guys so make
sure you thumbs video up if you want
more videos and I might giveaways notes
and so yeah go and enter in that if you
have not already so
I enjoyed this video let me know I guess
it can come solo and I'll see you guys
when it's over I don't know once intro
is like so weird for me felt like it's
so like I'm keep messing with words okay
yeah watch the video guys so to start
out with my makeup look I'm just
applying a Revlon powder to my face
since it's the summer I really don't
like wearing heavy makeup especially
going on an airplane so I just apply
that powder then I apply my hoola
bronzer I don't really have any method
of contouring I basically put it all
over my face I'll start out in the
hollows and then I blend it out
everywhere just because I like my whole
face to have a bronzer look then I take
my soft it hurts off soft and gentle but
it's a Mac mineralized skinfinish and I
just put it on the highlights of my face
and then I make a C motion around my
eyes then I take my NARS Laguna or not
larges and koona NARS orgasm blush and I
just put that on my cheeks pretty simple
you guys that's basically my whole face
looks very easy then for my eyes I just
primed my eyes with my Mac Paint Pot in
bare study this is my all-time favorite
primer it's so so pretty and it makes
your makeup last all day and it's good
for any color then I'm taking my awesome
and naked smoky palette and using radar
on my lid it's just kind of like a
metallic brown color and this is my
favorite Naked palette so far guys it's
so awesome I seriously love it so much
so yeah I'm just applying that my lid
and then I'm going in with armor and
it's kind of like a grey color so I'm
kind of mixing the grays and the Browns
and I'm just applying that in my crease
it's as easy as that this is such a
simple makeup look and I think it looks
so good and I'm really really loving the
grey and brown mixed in together next
I'm taking my Kat Von D liquid eyeliner
and I'm just applying that on my upper
lash line I love love love this eyeliner
and I found it I lost it and now I found
it so I'm so happy but then I lost it
again coming back from Mexico
oh my they're gonna need to find it or
repurchase it then I just curl my
eyelashes and I apply my favorite
they're real mascara and this is the
blue color I've been wearing this every
single day which is kind of weird but
like everyone complements me on it and
it's so pretty and it's like the
prettiest pop of color on your
it looks like you're wearing blue
eyeliner Ben said you're wearing blue
mascara and seriously it just makes your
eyes stand out so much especially for
brown eyes a lot of things don't make it
stand out but this certainly does and
then I'm done with my makeup look
as for my hair goes it's such a simple
and easy look I'm just going to show you
guys basically what I did it's so so
easy I don't even know why it's like a
tutorial but I basically just did a high
ponytail so I took all my hair put it as
flat as I could on top of my head and I
use a pink hair tie just because I
thought it'd kind of be cute like a
little pop of color so I just used a
pink hair tie to make a super high
ponytail and that is literally all I did
oh yeah
hope you guys like it but this is like
my favorite go-to look whenever I have
the second day hair
trees of green and red roses too I must
ask for breakfast goes we went to the
best breakfast buffet inside the hotel
we just got a classic Mexican breakfast
a lot of rice a lot of beans a lot of
meat um and then I obviously had coffee
because I love coffee in the morning we
took a bus to the airport so this is me
on the bus whoa crazy kinda
self-explanatory but yeah so now we are
at the airport and it was pretty busy so
what I basically wore was I wore a crop
top and high-waisted shorts and sutter
my crop top is from American Eagle my
shorts are from Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch my
rainbows are from Nordstrom and my
sweater is from holster and the sweater
is my favorite investment ever it was
only $15 so I wouldn't call it an
investment but I wear it everywhere it's
so so nice and then my bag is from
forever 21 and my purse is from Windsor
store definitely need a couple bags to
travel I had one travel bag and one
purse they let me carry that on and yeah
so that's just basically my airport
style I love wearing the high ponytail
to the airport it's just so so easy so
we're just walking around the airport
and we bought some perfume from the
duty-free shop and of course I need to
have my Starbucks even though I had
coffee in the morning I love Starbucks
the guy working the counter was so nice
so shout out to you Starbucks counter
guy oh yeah so that's basically all I
did until takeoff and yeah just enjoy my
drink waited to board and then took off
to Mexico and the way going off is so
pretty because you see the water right
away
