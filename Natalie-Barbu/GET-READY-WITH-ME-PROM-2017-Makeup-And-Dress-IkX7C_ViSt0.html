am through my prom makeup at alpha
tutorial I'm so excited because this
video I love doing every year and it's
actually one of my most viewed videos
both of them are from two years ago and
from last year so hopefully we can make
this one another most abused one that'd
be super cool so if you liked this video
make sure to give it a thumbs up and if
you're new to my channel be sure to
subscribe
I've got videos every Tuesdays and
Fridays so happy to see you guys because
the look it's definitely different than
the other ones the other ones are both
very natural and this one I opted for a
smokey eye and like a darker lip so I'm
very excited it's that way look that
I've never done before but I'm actually
also in college so I'm not going to prom
so this video is just for you guys you
can also use them for any 44mph returnee
bernal's any special events that you
want also definitely not just for prom
but I love doing prom videos so I make
sure to do it every year because I know
that when I was going to prom I watch so
many of them so I really just want to
help you guys out and give you some
inspiration and different looks at what
I did in the past but you just don't
like this one you should also watch my
other two videos I will have that linked
down below but without further ado let's
just get into the video okay so we are
starting off with a bare and clean face
so I am starting with the eyes because I
want to do this scotch tape angled eye
shadow look so you just go from the tip
of your eyebrow to the edge of your
outer eye and that is how I drew my line
you could make it a little more vertical
a little more horizontal I recommend if
anything go a little more horizontal but
yeah that's a good indicator of where to
draw your tape so for our things first
we're just priming the eyes you can do
this before or after you put the tape on
it doesn't really matter now I am using
the Kylie eyeshadow kit this is our
holiday collection I labeled the numbers
so this is number one we are applying
our base into the crease with Abell
lending rush it's a very light pink
color it's a very good blending and base
color I use it all the time then we are
applying our purple color into the outer
crease I'm using in crease brush and I'm
applying it to the outer crease focusing
but also bringing it in but not too much
because you really just want to focus it
on the outside so this is a really nice
color because it kind of matches with
the pink and I don't know I just love
the way it all blends together I think
it looks so good then I'm also using the
Kylie eyeshadow but this is one of her
like Paint Pot things and it is a very
very gold shimmery color so before you
think this will cling mardi-gras don't
worry we're applying another color on
top I just really wanted a super super
shimmery color on the eyelid base then
we are applying number three which is a
brown shimmer and we are applying this
onto your lid I mainly put it all over
my lid and then I focus it on the
outside as I'm reapplying to make the
inner corner still have a little bit of
a pop from the gold going in with my
first color again and he's blending
everything together and that is it for
the eye shadow next I'm going in with a
black pencil liner my favorite is urban
decay and a quick tip is instead of
pulling at your eye and tugging it to
draw a straight line it's best if you
just kind of glaze your eyes downward
and then draw it from there you'll get
the right amount of thickness and it
looks really really good
then I am applying the brown shimmery
color on my lower lash line and this is
just kind of to connect everything
together and not just be a harsh black
line underneath and I'm taking off the
tape and that's it for the eye shadow
now for the skin I always start off with
my rose water spray this is my favorite
spray just really Prime's the skin and
freshens it up I absolutely love it then
I'm applying my perfecting base from
L'Oreal for prom you definitely want a
primer even if you don't normally wear
primer I would highly suggest wearing
one for this night because you want to
make sure it stays on all day
I'm mixing my favorite mac foundation
with my mac strobe cream they mix those
together to get a nice glow my skin it
was glowing after this
you don't look too shiny so don't worry
you just look really really healthy and
just bright and it just looks so so good
I absolutely love this foundation I
recommend it to anyone that I'm applying
the Maybelline age rewind concealer
which I need to buy another one up now
making sure not to ruin my eye shadow
but I'm applying that in triangles
underneath my eyes and I'm also I'm
applying it on my forehead bridge of my
nose and my chin this is to brighten
everything up so this is a lighter color
than what I would normally wear for
foundation I just really brightens your
whole face up especially with the sherab
cream and the highlight it just looks so
so good and I blend it out with a damp
Beauty Blender next we're gonna bake so
baking is something that I don't do
every single day but I really really
love doing it on special occasions
because it really makes sure that
nothing creases so I apply a lot of the
L'Oreal translucent powder underneath my
eyes and then I move on to my eyebrows
just so that I can let that powder set
then I'm doing my eyebrows with the
anastasia brow powder i really really
like this i do think i like a pencil
better but I've been using this just
because I have a lot of products and I
am just outlining my natural shape I
definitely have eyebrows already so I
don't really know how to describe how to
put them on if you don't really have I
browse but then I'm applying my brow
definer or I forgot what it was called
but it just brushes out the brows and
makes them even more bold and thick and
make sure that they don't move now I'm
brushing it off because enough is enough
you know I can't have that on all day
and then I am applying my Maybelline fit
me in a dark color to contour I like
contouring the foundation more than
concealer because it's a lot easier to
blend and I think it makes it look less
cakey because it's not as heavy so that
I'm blending it out with my Beauty
Blender and I'm actually trying to blend
it upwards more than downwards because I
feel like you want to contour more up
and down if that makes any sense
then I'm applying my NYX illuminator I
really really love this color it really
really makes you look very glowy but
very subtle it's not very heavy at all
blending it out with my fingers and then
I'm going in blind beauty blender I'm
also going to apply a highlighter on top
because for special occasions you need
to make sure that your highlighter is
poppin so I applied Mac soft and gentle
on the apples of my cheeks or not the
apples but the high bones high
cheekbones
I guess say it then I'm going in with my
Physicians Formula bronze Easter and I
am just gently contouring where I
already contoured this is just to set it
because I contoured at the foundation
and now I want to set it with a powder
so you don't want to go any too much
heavier because I really liked the glow
that I have and then I'm contouring my
nose with the powder
so just because I made a highlight just
because I highlighted my nose I really
want to make sure I contour it also just
to even it out I think that's really
important and then I'm going in with my
NARS orgasm blush and this is my go-to
blush whenever I wear it for special
events I do like to wear blush because I
think it gives you a healthy complexion
and it just looks better I blend it all
on my nose and just kind of like run it
across just to make it all look blended
then I'm applying any pink eyeliner or
not eyeliner pink lipliner that you have
this one is from NYX and I'm applying
that for a contrast with my liquid
lipstick so I'm using the Kylie I
believe this is in the shade Malibu and
applying that all over my lips it gives
you kind of like a brown purple and it
matches your eyeshadow perfectly which
is exactly the look I was going for then
I am curling my eyelashes and I know I'm
doing make a tutorial in a super weird
order and I'm applying my Too Faced
better than sex mascara if you guys have
falsies I would highly recommend them
but I don't know how to put false
eyelashes on so I did not do those in
this video but if you want an extra look
I would definitely do that and then
I just spray my rosewater spray to set
my makeup and that is the end of this
look so I hope you guys
