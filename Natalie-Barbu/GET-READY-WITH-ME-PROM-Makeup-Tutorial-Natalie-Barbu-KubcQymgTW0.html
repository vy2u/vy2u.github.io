wait
give my love
hey everyone its Natalie here and I'm
going to be showing you guys my prom get
ready with me I'm not actually going to
prom because I am a 21 years old almost
22 but I always loved filming these just
to give you guys any inspiration for
your prom or formals or anything like
that but I'm just gonna start off by
priming my face this is just gonna make
sure that I have a moisturize base and
then I am going in with the L'Oreal Lumi
glow this is my all-time favorite
it has replaced my mac strobe cream it
just gives you such a nice glow
underneath your foundation and it
doesn't make you look greasy once you
apply the foundation it's just like so
so pretty and just makes you literally
glisten and then I'm applying the NARS
sheer glow foundation this is the first
time I act actually tried it and I
really really like it it is more oily
though so if you have oily or skin it
might not be the best for you but I am
just blending that out with a Beauty
Blender and applying an even base all
over my face and if you guys want any of
the products I'm just gonna write them
all down down below and then I'm going
to be using my NARS concealer and I'm
just applying this underneath my eyes
this concealer is also one of the first
times using it and I really really love
how much it brightens especially in
photos I've noticed it makes your eyes
look super super bright which is
definitely what a like a good thing when
you're taking prom pictures or formal
pictures or just anything in general I
just think it's a really really great
concealer and then I am blending that
out with my Beauty Blender
and after a concealer I applied this
Laura Mercier translucent powder and
instead of baking I just put it on with
a brush and I sweep it underneath my
eyes this is gonna make sure that it
doesn't crease and that it lasts all day
long and this does not have any
flashback in photos like it doesn't make
you look super white or anything like
that I feel like a lot of these loose
powders sometimes can be hit or miss by
this Laura Mercier one is my favorite
and then I use the Marc Jacobs dewdrops
and I apply tiny tiny bits on the high
points of my cheekbones and I blend it
out with the Beauty Blender and this one
is so good it literally makes you go
listen and it's just like a little goes
a long way so I will never ever be
finished with the bottle as long as I
live I swear it literally like I use a
tiny drop and then I go in with my hoola
by benefit bronzer and with an angled
brush I just sweep it across my
cheekbones in a straight line like that
and I blend blend blend and I also put
it on my temples and blend it into my
hairline to make me look really tan and
I also contour at the side of my nose
after I'm done with the bronzer I go in
with my Laura Mercier golden highlighter
and I just sweep a little bit on my
cheekbones this helps to set the dew
drops but also to make you look a little
more glowy especially when you're taking
photos you do want to look like you got
some glow going on so I always go a
little overboard with the highlighter
but I think it looks so good especially
in pictures and next I can move on to
the eyes and I start off by priming my
eyes you can use any of your favorite
eyeshadow primer I don't really have a
specific favourites concealer works too
and this just makes your eyeshadow stay
on as long as possible and then I go in
with my Anastasia brow shaper brow
powder I really know it's called and I
blend in or I fill in and my eyebrows
and I just go along with my natural
shape I'm blessed to be born with
eyebrows so I don't really know any
other way to fill them in but I just
brush and go along natural shape of my
brows
for the eyeshadow I go in with my hoola
bronzer and I blend that all over my lid
and crease this I just do with a
blending brush this is gonna serve as a
really really good base for my eyes and
then I go in with the Naked 2 basics
palette and as you can see I use a lot
of them but I'm going in with a darker
brown color and again all of the items
like all of the names of the eyeshadows
the palette name everything will be down
below so if you want to know specific
names that will be down below in the
description and a clickable link reader
shop it but I'm just applying this
darker brown color in my crease and
making sure it's nice and blended
throughout my crease this is gonna serve
also as a good kind of base but also it
was gonna give my eyeshadow a lot of
dimension which is what I'm going for
cuz I'm going for more of a not cut
crease look but kind of a little bit and
then I'm going in with my sealer liquid
eyeshadow I'm applying this first color
it's a little bit more pinky undertones
and I am rubbing that all over my lid
these eyeshadows are to die for they
aren't amazing it was my first time
using them and I was obsessed the
pigment is amazing that it does not like
it lasts all day long it does not come
off even if you rub it like once it
dries it is stuck there until you take a
makeup remover wipe so I just built it
up until I liked the way it looked and
then I went in with this brown Stila
liquid 'hi shadow and I applied it on
top of the pink one this one just gave
it more of a pinky brown color instead
of either like just super pink or just
super brown so it just gave it more of a
go listen but I am obsessed I feel like
I want to wear these every single day I
think they made my eyes look so freakin
good
I cannot say enough good things about
them no this isn't sponsored I swear but
I just blended it until I liked the way
it looked so it's super super super
buildable and again I just did the same
exact thing to the other eye
once I'm tied with the gold shimmering
eyeshadow I am going back in with that
hoola bronzer and blending that into my
crease and then I'm going back with a
darker brown eyeshadow and applying this
in the outer si or outer V of my eye so
I'm not bringing this all the way into
my inner corner this is gonna give it
more dimension and depth to my eyeshadow
and I just do that on both of them with
this crease brush highly highly
recommend adding a darker color to the
outer corner I think for any look it
just makes it look a little more sultry
so this is definitely my favorite and
don't be afraid of covering up a little
bit of the glimmer because it will blend
just like really really nicely and you
won't cover it up as you guys see and
then whatever I have left over on the
brush I apply underneath my eye to blend
it and then I'm using my Kat Von D
liquid eyeliner in the brown shade just
because I didn't want it to be too harsh
of a look I really liked the softness of
the brown eyeliner and I am winging it
out and doing that on both eyes
after the winged eyeliner I just go in
with a brown eyeliner and I put that
underneath my lash line just to even it
out a little more and I really like
Brown better than black I think it makes
my eyes pop and then I take whatever is
left on the crease brush and blend it
against the brown eyeshadow or eyeliner
that I just put and now on for the lips
I put this Urban Decay lipliner it's
very like a natural shade it's kind of
like my normal lip color except enhanced
and I just line on my lips with that and
act a little weird and then I apply my
MAC lipstick this is just a natural kind
of pinky shade but it also is kind of
like my natural lip color except better
and I really really love it I love that
it's not too bright or anything like
that I think it looks so so good in that
is it for my makeup look so I really
hope that you guys enjoyed and I hope
they guys have such a fun and safe time
