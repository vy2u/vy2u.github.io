Renee this is my roommate and we have
been roommates for two years now and
we're living together this summer and
we're also living together next year and
most likely its senior year I don't see
us not living together so here so yeah
basically my roommate
all of college which is crazy video
we're gonna do is a little bit of a
roommate tag oh so we're doing a makeup
test oh all right
so we're doing the roommate tag in this
video and we're doing our makeup during
yeah just like we just felt like do not
make our everyday makeup like I've been
doing this makeup for like so long well
it's a very casual video I guess it's
gonna like a chitchat get ready with me
video except we're answering questions
to get to know each other like for you
guys get to know us and Renee just made
a youtube channel so I'm married very
proud and I'm just very happy that she
made one and so you guys need to go and
subscribe click on her face yeah I'm
into Alaska for like 10 days with my
family and we went on a bunch of
excursions that were literally
breathtaking and unreal like I could not
believe that I was actually there at
that time
so check some video footage of it and
I'm trying to make a video now which
I've never done before
so I'm hoping it turns out well I like
saw some clips of it I haven't seen like
how she edited but like I saw the clips
and like it is so unbelievable so go and
watch that video
right after you watch this one and I
hope that you guys enjoyed this one so
yeah follow us on our instagrams I will
link them both down below and comment on
this and subscribe and thumbs it up and
all that good stuff I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and then let's return
with the video how are you gonna do
without I'm here
I literally thing so just
I mean just like what I'm doing my eye
shadow and asleep but the first question
of the roommate tag is and we have our
laptop down here so we're like gonna be
glancing down here but it is did you
guys know each other before you became a
roommates and we were actually suite
mates freshman year so we weren't
roommates I like we shared a bathroom in
her room was like attached to the
bathrooms so we were basically roommates
but no we didn't know each other before
freshman year we like communicated
through Facebook and then we met move-in
day we actually all four of us met move
it oh my god you remember that and I
like saw you yeah yes I okay so like we
had moved into our building and like you
got there first
no because I was like an animai car I
think they just arriving oh yeah that's
not her
either we like didn't know each other
beforehand we just like met on Facebook
and I followed us each other on
Instagram and so moving day we saw each
other like I had seen her cuz I
recognize her from her pictures and she
had seen me because she recognized me
from my pictures but we didn't know each
other so we like both ignored each other
second question is what did you guys
initially think of each other the first
time you met so I actually I remember
since I followed her I had no idea what
to expect but she had no idea was like
just gonna
you all thought I was me than you did
you think it was me I didn't think you
were mean I just like you were like a
really edgy and liked I like oh my god
you know like I like I I'm like I don't
know more like I don't know hard
feelings
yeah like insert pictures of her and
stray I'm here because this is one
picture I know dark eyeliner is like all
I remember I like dark eyeliner you
swear like black eyeliner like top and
bottom really thick not really thick but
like on top it was really thick and so
like I switched a brown now and it's way
more subtle remember thinking like
you are really pretty on Facebook not in
person but on face none of employment
before I met you yeah and then when I
met you you were like 10 times teenager
in person like not like you were fat at
all like all right on Facebook but just
like in person you were like I mean like
a miniature human it should poke your
head and was like hey I was right
oh yeah because it was like my birthday
like the first week we were there and so
I tried to really reach out to y'all but
and I'll say please like come in our
room whenever you want like you were
really nice yeah and yeah okay and then
you're like in bed and I was like going
back out how long did it take until you
guys became friends so I would say it's
probably took like two weeks I think I
took a while we like did our own things
for sure at first what you guys usually
argue about you and you don't argue
about it here is we don't do on each
other's nerves yeah we yeah we're the
ones like like don't get annoyed with
each other the least amount anything
we've been mad about do you guys both
have the same passion for makeup um I
would say I like really like makeup I
like experimenting with makeup and
anyone yeah I feel like I'm really in
makeup but I mean you've obviously been
doing this channel felt like a lot
longer but I've just kind of been doing
the same thing like forever but I think
if I wanted to like I would yeah we both
like it in the most out of all of our
roommates I think what does she think
about your YouTube yeah I guess you're
supportive No yeah I love that she does
it um I feel like when did I find out I
was halfway through yeah I didn't
publicize it a lot so it wasn't like a
big thing like I mean it wasn't like you
I'm gonna publicize it so it was kind of
hard for people to like know about it I
didn't even announce it on my Instagram
until like halfway for a semester of
college I didn't not like no one knew
about
and guys subscribe to her channel
because she's just starting it so I
didn't have one yet I know what vices
videos that you oh yeah
so subscribe to her because that would
be so cool if you guys could all
subscribe to her she's gonna start
making videos and that's really exciting
so I will link it down below and her
first video is already up so go and
check it out it's her Alaska video you
should subscribe to her comment down
below so I know like who subscribed to
her from this channel or this video who
spends the most time getting ready in
the morning 100% Renae why don't I have
to present you were late to everything I
am late like and you take a long time to
get ready okay feel like a lot of it is
like me everything goes wrong like I
have the worst luck I'm getting ready
and just like everything goes wrong and
takes longer but a lot of the time is
like I wake up stick where like later
than I should yep do you guys get fed up
with each other from seeing each other
too often I would say no I mean I only
see each other like too much and if we
like already getting tired that can
going on yeah we definitely have our own
space like we're not together 24/7 we
have our own space for sure one of the
roommate questions which is kind of
weird to be like a romaine question but
it is what are your nationalities so 9
most of you guys might notice notice if
you have been following me for a while
but my dad is from Romania and then my
mom is from Honduras
so I guess European and Hispanic um so
my mom and it's 100% Bolivian she lived
in Bolivia like all her childhood and
then came to the United States so I'm
half Bolivian and then my dad is just
he's very white I didn't know he's like
Swedish and I like my next question is
do you do you use your roommate's things
about asking do you I know you do you
actually got an answer to that I don't
think so I think I'm used like
one time like your face st. your pay but
wow I'm like oh my and it's honestly
because I got a camera I never told you
I don't care
the only thing I'm use of yours without
asking is your senior what you ask I
kind of gave you like perm thank you
basically it's on my steiner like always
i know but what are your favorite things
that you guys like to do with each other
so we go out to dinners a lot and you're
like yeah i need you like whenever we
hang out we got it in there so we go out
to dinners a lot and we like I don't
know like I just
we hang out in someone's room a lot so
look it's either her room or my room
normally I think those are the two rooms
that are like always used next question
is have you ever thought about having
pets or a pet I mean I you know I always
have thought about having a bed grenades
um I like to call dog obsessed
she's definitely dog obsessed I've never
met someone that's more in love with
dogs that Renee like every time I think
of a dog I think of Renee it's just like
I'm like and I Mackenzie - I'm handed
hand thing but I think of cats I think
of my other roommate Anna what I think
of dogs I instantly think of Renee and
take a snapshot and send it to her like
no matter what no matter how ugly the
dog is nothing cute it is and I like if
I see it from like a mile away like I
was like that to her
what is the funniest thing that you guys
have done together we were actually
talking about this question before we
filmed this video and we have no idea it
was like finals week and I'm Anna
my major is fashion and textiles and so
we were doing a Jeopardy game on like
the I feel like it was on like nits or
something and basically what happened
what it is I answered a question and the
answer
whale-like but like smell wal yes and
like I knew the answer so quickly and I
just raised my hand and just like
shouting from the whole class like what
is what is Wales and so like it's Wales
I'm like the thing is you know the
rapper wale wale really while a like and
so I said it and just like the whole
class was just like why it like everyone
just said busted out laughing like my
teacher was just like laughing her butt
off like and they were like it's Wales
and I just like how to explain that but
just like nobody knows who that robber
is everyone knows it I didn't know
well this felt like with an H and like
wall a is the mapper and I just wall is
so now this actually works out perfectly
exciton the final step of my makeup and
is the last question so who has being
roommates helped or hurt to your
relationship what do you think obviously
help you know like our only friends
yeah we're literally like each other's
best friends at school and like yeah we
do everything together we talk all day
every day over text yeah so it
definitely has helped and considering we
didn't know each other before school
like obviously it helps our relationship
so I was in Savoy yesterday and I was
like just just walking
the work Wow argh you put a word and
then I look up better and she goes
eyeballs you got it hard oh dude oh girl
so I hope that guys enjoyed this video
it's super random and like we didn't
talk you guys through the makeup steps

were getting ready just for you guys to
