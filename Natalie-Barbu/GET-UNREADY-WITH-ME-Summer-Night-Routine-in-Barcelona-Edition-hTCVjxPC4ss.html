doing my intro to this nigra tina blog
style because the video is going to be
blog style so i really wanted to do one
of these because i just posted my
morning routine and that one was more
like with a voiceover and it was not
blog style so i want to make this one a
little more realistic and show you what
i'm doing step by step and minute my
Bennet and while I am in Barcelona for
my night routine I also want to thank
glam glow for sponsoring this video
thank you so much I'm obsessed with
their products and I am showing the
dream duo skincare kind of like an
overnight makeover basically if what it
does it's amazing I love it I'm going to
show you guys how I use it and how much
I love it
so if you just want to check them out I
will have that all in the description
below but thank you guys so much for
watching and let's just get into the
video
we're eating dinner at this really good
restaurant kind of on on by industry and
3m me but I have over 500 of mazing
reviews and Asian fusion place but still
tapas style so very Spanish and I love
it I love trying different things like
topless assembly by Camille because I
love eating so many different flavors
and just sampling different foods but
the bull shark might always run sinner
except one in Spain you have to eat in
early 30 and we are getting bitter right
now but do as the Spanish do when you're
in space and really good on my family
and then I'm going to go back to the
hotel
we have ordered about 40 and tapas the
guy said that we should order like eight
for the size of Olympics but we have 14
because we're from America and yeah
these plays are way too small
yeah they're we're clearing out their
kitchen part of our night stuff going
home so we are currently on the bus by
the way of our plan of amazing public
transportation very easy to use
haha
we are back in the hotel so we just took
a bus over here to the hotel and public
transformation like I was saying is
amazing in Spain this hotel is also so
nice really bright like right now but
yeah but which oh it was so nice and I'm
surprised I'm not that tired I think
it's due to the fact that we woke up
it's to today but I am about to just
normally whenever I get back from a
vacation or when I'm on vacation and I
get back to the hotel room I just go
straight to my suitcase and I put on my
PJs
so I will 100% to be just doing that
right now not my messy suitcase is
anyone else's suitcase get like this
after which is some day one of a
vacation because it's online looks right
when I open it all right where is Miss
peaches and then the struggle is when
I'm trying to find my PJs that's
definitely struggle I will be taking
this off and putting this on these are
always my handy PJ's when I go on
vacation and I don't like wearing super
nice clothes when I'm on vacation so I
just have this cute t-shirts from
Goodwill and then I got these shorts on
from Gili Hicks yeah this is anyone else
don't care what they look like when
they're with their family that's me and
then the next thing I do is just go to
the bathroom and I wash my face and take
off my makeup which if you are a girl
you will understand this is the worst
part of your day I hate taking off my
makeup it's the worst I don't mind
washing my face I don't mind brushing my
teeth but taking off my makeup for some
reason it's like the worst thing ever
now my skin is 100% makeup free or at
least I hope it's 100% makeup free but
then I'm about to wash my face and brush
my teeth and for the moisturizer that I
was talking about I am using the glam
glow dream duo so I first apply the
dream serum and then after about 30
seconds I'll apply the dream seal but
what I love about this is that it
hydrates you and it plumps you which is
why it makes you kind of look like you
had a makeover overnight and why you
already have highlighter on I think it's
amazing I use it every single night so
now I'm just applying the first cream
all over my face it smells so good you
guys it sounds like an orange Chloe said
it's not like an orange creamsicle and
then I wait a little bit for that once
dry and I apply the second side of it
which works more as being moisturizer it
is great looking moisturizer and I will
apply that all over my face I absolutely
love this moisturizer I can 100% tell
when I don't sleep with it because my
skin to look as hydrated as a student
the night before but it just makes you
kind of already have a below even when
you wake up so before your makeup it's a
great base to kind of start the night
before or even if you're not wearing
makeup it makes you just look a little
bit healthier like I think of it as
kinda like my Mac strobe cream it
reminds me of that like it put it on
before makes you look a lot more glowy
and like lit up but then you would
without it so I really really enjoy it
don't make me break out and it's just
glib low is a company that I've loved
for a long time I haven't lunched their
backs
and I really like that my sister has
used them before too I highly recommend
this moisturizer and I'm very picky with
what I put on my face because I know I'm
not breaking out right now but I'm
extremely acne prone you can see my
other videos on acne but yeah I'm
extremely acne problem so a lot of
things make me break out so I need to be
careful with what I put on my face and
this what I have been using for about
two weeks now and it has not made me
break out at all and at the end of the
night I just go into bed and I'll simply
either read a book if I brought one
which I did and then I'll scroll through
social media so make sure to follow me
on all of that but yeah I just looked
through Instagram Facebook Twitter all
that good stuff and I think they like to
post a picture since I'm in Europe and
the time change is about six hours and
when I normally live by the time I'm
going to bed it's like prime Instagram
time for the u.s. people show up early
going to post another one tonight I'm
definitely kind of several posts I think
because there's so many pictures here

Barcelona before please let me know in
