I'm getting a little late of a start
today is almost three o'clock but I
literally have not done anything today
it's so yeah I'm about to head down to
CVS to get some makeup because I want to
try new foundation because obviously
your girl needs it and I just don't
really like the new makeup forever
formula I've been using makeup forever
forever and I've been using this new
formula for a while like the new one
from like I used it way back when and
then I like continued using it but they
made a new formula in the middle and I
just like I'm not feeling it so I'm
gonna go get my things like maybelline
lumi or l'oreal lumi one of the two I
always get the stream except um get that
foundation maybe check out a new brush
cuz I kind of want a buffing brush
because I'm not really into my Beauty
Blender anymore either I'd like to apply
all over my face so yeah you guys can
tell I'm like breaking out a lot it's
actually so much better than before you
guys believe it or not and I'm really
honestly like embarrassed to show it to
you guys on camera but I am too lazy to
put makeup on and it's vlogmas so it's
like well take her leave it guys
so when I head down there to get some
makeup and if you guys have any any
fighting tips leave them in the comments
below because I feel you guys if you
guys have acne and I would love to get
your tips and tricks but it's clearing
up so much from before so like I'm
actually kind of happy with it so yeah
once my skin clears completely I'm
actually gonna do how I cleared my skin
video but I'm just waiting on my skin's
actually clear before I do that so
hopefully that's maybe within the next
like two months or something cuz I'm not
trying to have this for more than two
months actually also just tried the
curling like the InStyler
rotating smoother I thought it was a
curling iron but it's actually like a
straightener smoother my hair has never
been softer so I'm excited for that
because I'm actually gonna film the
video tomorrow but I wanted to try it
first because if I didn't like it then I
wasn't going to do it in the video but
yeah I love it it's awesome and my hair
is so soft because I has a brush so it's
like smooth out your
there huh in the elevator where I live
with lovely two day old freakin puke and
a beer can
college that's literally a sum the
picture of college hey guys so I just
got back from CVS and I picked up some
makeup that I'm excited about and I
watched desi Perkins video where she
does like all liquid foundation and
bronzer highlighter and doesn't use any
powder and so I want to try that because
I feel like I just look a little cakey
with powder on so I'm trying that out
and I like don't really like my
foundation anymore so I just got some
drugstore products because I feel like
drugstore products or honestly like just
as good as expensive ones and some
things so I don't know I'm just gonna
test them out the first thing that I got
is this l'oreal infallible pro glow so
I've actually tried this before because
Chloe and my mom have it and I really
like it so I'm excited to see how it
wears like all day every day make sure
it doesn't break me Oh like that step so
yeah if you guys have this let me know
if it made a new breakout because if it
did I don't want to use it the next
thing that I got is this primer I
normally don't wear primer but I
actually kind of want to start wearing
primer just to make sure if I don't use
powder that my makeup lasts all day so I
got this L'Oreal magic perfecting base
it's a face primer I was gonna get the
redness one but I don't have red skin I
just like have like sometimes my pimples
are red so I feel like that's better for
just like a color correcting concealer
instead of a whole primer because I
don't have like rosacea or anything so I
thought that it'd be too much um so yeah
I got this Maybelline or not Maybelline
L'Oreal I always mix up Maybelline
L'Oreal there was a whole video where I
said Maybelline and it was actually
L'Oreal or the other way around and
someone called me out on it on the
comments I was really embarrassed and
then the next thing I got was this NYX
liquid illuminator I really was looking
for the L'Oreal Lumi one but they didn't
have it at CVS so it was just like that
whatever I'll get this one and if I
don't like it then I'll return it and go
and get the L'Oreal one because that's
the one that does he Perkins war and it
was like so pretty on her skin so and
then I got this foundation stick thing
it's not early foundation stick it's
L'Oreal True Match crayon corrector
so it's just like a brawn like a dark
color so I can do bronzer with it and
hopefully I will see how it looks
because I'm just like I just like hate
my skin right now and I want her to look
better so yeah that's all I got at CVS
quick haul for you guys um but yeah let
me know if you guys have ever tried any
of those products and if you guys like
them because I would love to know but
I'm gonna try that out right now
actually so this is the final makeup and
I really really like it so I think I
might try out the L'Oreal Lumi
highlighter though because this
highlighter is a little bit orange I
don't know if you guys can see it on
camera but I'm still kinda getting used
to liquid highlighter so it might not
look perfect but practice makes perfect
so I'm just gonna keep trying I do like
the way it feels I don't feel like I
have makeup on compared to when I wear
powder I feel like I have like a pound
of makeup on and I feel really gross so
I've put no powder except a tiny bit of
translucent powder underneath my eyes
but like barely anything and then I just
set my makeup with a setting spray so
and if you guys know or have tried any
of the products I use let me know in the
comments below I think I'm filling a
makeup book tomorrow so that's the only
reason why I didn't want to film me
doing my makeup because I'm gonna be
filming this tomorrow but yeah let me
know if you guys liked it and I will
show you how it looks throughout the day
so my roommate that fosters kittens
which I talk about a lot and like always
post on my stories is this roommate this
is Anna
hey everyone she's looking lady but
crazy because really what she called me
so she just Foster's them and we just
get to keep a bunch of kittens for
however long the lady that owns all of
them needs help any weirdo my
like little I'm using it was so hard it
doesn't this
so basically our apartment is a petting
zoo because my roommate also my other
roommate actually just bought a puppy so
I'm gonna show you guys her feel like
okay okay right yeah okay look over here
you're just too cute six oh my fur so
many people and you're gonna have to
stalk for 15 years I know I mean
literally I'm like the happiest person
ever so cute I love her fur she's so
soft
does she shed or is she gonna shed yeah
she's probably gonna shed like later
oh yeah it was literally the cutest
thing I have ever seen like oh my
goodness so free thank you I'm so
excited for it to me around the
apartment I was a little skeptical about
it not gonna lie but it's mainly gonna
be at her boyfriend's house actually so
it won't be too bad we won't have like
dogs pee and poop everywhere but it's
just so cute so excited to have a dog
with like easyacc and this is also the
way my makeup turned out it still looks
pretty much intact but I also did put it
on at 4 o'clock 3 or 4 or maybe like 3
o'clock or something like that so like
it wasn't like I put it on at 8 a.m. and
now it's currently 9:15 but it does stay
on for the most part I actually like the
way it looks especially because I didn't
set it with a powder so I think that's
kind of impressive but I think I'm just
gonna in the belong here because all I'm
just studying it for my final while
laying in bed and
yeah not very fun so I'm just ending the
vlog here so I hope you guys enjoyed
this vlog and seeing basically my
petting zoo and then yeah give it a
thumbs up if you guys liked it subscribe
for more videos because YouTube is doing
this weird thing where people are losing
subscribers and like no one's getting
any views on their videos and I don't
know it's just very weird so I
appreciate all the comments I can get
just because I think that they're doing
it with like whichever video has the
most comments and that's the one that
they're gonna show I don't know it's a
weird algorithm no one likes it I don't
know why they did it but yeah make sure
you leave a comment down below thumbs
