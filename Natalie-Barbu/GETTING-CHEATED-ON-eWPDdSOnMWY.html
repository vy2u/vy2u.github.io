today I'm filming a sitting down and
talking video I really love filming
these videos just because I love talking
to you guys and just honestly like you
guys are my friends
so when I vent to my friends I like
venting to you guys too so we are going
to talk about a very tricky subject that
I honestly have been avoiding and I
don't do like controversial videos on my
channel and I don't really do these like
more controversial topics I guess and I
guess this isn't really controversial it
suggests something different than what I
normally do but I feel like I should
address it to me just because I have
gone through college and high school and
I've seen so much of this go on and I
have experienced it myself
so I feel like I need to talk about
cheating so let's talk I didn't want
this to be a story time video because
personally I don't like putting that
much of my personal information out on
the internet because a lot of people
watch my videos from high school and a
lot of people watch my videos that know
me and know the people that aren't
involved in these life experiences that
I could share so I don't want to say
exactly too many details about my
cheating in the past but I have been
cheated on by someone I was in a
relationship with and honestly now I
have no hard feelings against that
person people if anyone's watching this
it knows what I'm talking about
I don't hate the person at all basically
I have been experienced like I've seen
people cheat on people all the time and
a lot of people ask like when is
cheating okay what technically is
cheating what why do you think will
cheat and I just kind of want to address
all those questions so what is cheating
let's just say what's cheating so it
really depends on you and the person
that you're with of what you guys define
as cheating but to me you guys are in a
relationship boyfriend and girlfriend
that person is your boyfriend that
person is your girlfriend and that
other person goes and hooks up with
someone else whether it is a kiss
whether it is a make-out whether it is
having sex with them whether it is doing
everything but sex whether whatever it
is if they are doing something that they
should only be doing with you
I think that's cheating so yeah that all
is considered cheating in my eyes and
also people are like well what's
cheating if it's like over text or over
social media or something like that well
a lot of people consider cheating like
they'll get mad a lot of people get mad
at their boyfriend or girlfriend if they
like another person picture that to me
is kind of absurd um I have been in a
situation though where I have gotten mad
at a person for doing that and it is the
person that was doing it not good things
on the side so like I feel like if
you're getting mad at your boyfriend for
like in another girl's picture because
her boobs were out and I or whatever the
situation is then that is kind of an
underlying issue of something else like
you don't trust that person why don't
you trust them and that was always the
same with me like I would always get
super super jealous and crazy honestly I
was crazy like I was suit so jealous and
like always constantly being like well
we're talking to like why you do this
why you do that all this stuff but
honestly like in my defense I did have a
reason to but also stupid me like if you
have a reason to be like that maybe the
relationship isn't working out today if
a question cheating is basically what
you and your boyfriend girlfriend
decided to be but I think that if you
guys aren't boyfriend/girlfriend you
guys should not have to talk about
whether hooking up is cheating because
it is in almost any relationship unless
you guys are in a open relationship then
there really is rip is not open to
anyone like when someone has something
hey do you want my girlfriend I don't
have to ask like okay well like let's
sit down let's set some ground rules up
can I kiss this guy can i hook up with
this guy can if I'm drunk at a party can
I go and make out with them no like that
just shouldn't be more like well if they
were drunk were they technically
cheating and I say yes they were Chive
no cheating because when you are drunk
you still know what you're doing I I
know that you're sometimes you get drunk
where you don't know what you're doing
and you don't even remember
anything but at the same time like if
you are committed to someone you should
always know and like always be thinking
about that person would like I am with
that person I should not be doing this
and I think that if every time you get
drunk and forget that then that's not a
good sign either that you are really
committed to that person so I have
friends who their boyfriends have
cheated on them and I know people that I
don't even really know that I hear their
boyfriend said she dropped that or I
have been to parties or situations where
I see a guy and I know he has a
girlfriend and then I see him making out
with someone else or I see him being
really touchy with someone else I've
seen it so much and I just like really
wanted to make a video on this this
video probably makes no sense and I am
so sorry if it sucks I just need to talk
about like just need to be done
I'm that person that I want to answer is
when is cheating okay
so that I kind of touched on it in the
last one but honestly I think the answer
is never
when you're drunk doesn't really give
you an excuse to cheat on someone I'm
sorry it doesn't mmm people are like
well what if we were on a break does
that count
um no if you were on a break you are
free to do whatever you want like I
don't get when people get mad at people
because they hook up with someone when
they're on a break like a break means
you guys aren't together in my opinion
why else would you go on a break like
who's gonna be like hey can we go on a
break
but still you're still mine like don't
do anything no you guys go on a break
because you're on a break if you guys
are not together then you're not
together and if people can't get mad at
that but that was answered to that
question and the next thing is what
happens if you get cheated on so this
mmm I have I have my thoughts Lamba so
guarantee you guys what happens if you
get cheated on so okay what happened
when I got cheated on was that this
subtext context thing okay so I
basically snooped through the person's
phone which like I was saying if I felt
the need to do that why was I dating
that person I don't know but I snooped
through your phone and I saw messages
that I did not like and they were not
just flirty messages they were very bad
messages
I'm just going to leave it at that
you're imagining your imagination can
run wild it wasn't just like the person
that I was with texting a girl like hey
like you looked cute today there were
some of those messages but they were
also other messages that I just was
there much in shock that the person I
was with was sending back to another
female um or multiple females for that
matter and I was absolutely crushed I
could feel my heart drop into my stomach
and crumble into a million pieces
and also another context background
situation was we had broken up for some
time and then we had like gotten back
together so some things may have
happened during the time when you're
broken up which I don't like how that is
whatever like they want to do that
whatever but other things happened while
you were in a relationship the first
time and when we were together like the
second time when I was reading these
messages so yeah just leave that there
um and I had been so crushed I couldn't
breathe I couldn't move I was just like
paralyzed in shock and I it was like the
worst feel like I have honestly ever
felt and I died as I'm making this video
so that I hope that you guys don't go
through it but if you do just know that
like it's it's gonna be okay basically
because I know it sucks um
and I'm just kind of trying to give you
my advice and you never think that's
going to happen when you are with
someone you are with them because you
love them because you really enjoy their
time because you like them a lot
whatever the situation is you're not
with someone because you hate them and
you think that they're the worst person
in the world you were with someone
because you see the best in them that is
why you're with them and for me thinking
I saw the best in this person and then
seeing a complete other side that I
never once saw it was kind of
eye-opening and really really crushing
and kind of just put through me all like
what's real what's not like what was a
lot when you told me this were you lying
what are we are you lying to me right
now look you
like me you know things like that go
through your head and it's so normal
because it's a little jobs um but that
is what cheating does cheating
completely makes you feel worthless it
makes you feel like everything that
person said was a lot and it makes you
feel like your whole relationship was
alive because if you were doing this and
you were so comfortable lying to me and
not telling me I just don't understand
how you could have looked at me the same
time I'm like how can you be constantly
like talking to me and then also talking
to these other girls and like saying
that and being completely okay how can I
be like coming over and like hanging out
with you whenever and like going out to
eat going on dates and like you know in
the back of your mind what you're doing
and then a few days later or like a week
later or something like that I don't
really remember just like maybe like a
week or less than a week even we had
gotten back together because the guy is
going to cry and he is going to say that
he loves you he's going to say that he
wasn't thinking and he's going to say
all those things that I genuinely
believe I completely believe them I
don't think that the guy necessarily
lies in my case and in some cases when
they say that I don't think that they
are like I actually hate you but I just
I'm just gonna say that I love you I
don't think that and I don't even think
some people are like well you didn't
really love me and honestly it's I don't
believe that it wasn't that they didn't
really love me when for like a year they
were saying they did I don't think that
someone could be that cruel and make it
like a complete joke like haha I'm
nothing I love her but I know no I think
what happens is that there's a lack of
respect and that is my biggest thing so
when a guy cheats on you or a girl I'm
just saying a guy because I'm a girl and
it's happened to me but girls can cheat
on guys too so this is really not gender
exclusive but when someone cheats on you
they are saying that they do not respect
your relationship enough to not do that
in to have self-control because I get
that sometimes you might feel like it's
hard when a girl
guys coming on to you and hear your may
be intoxicated or maybe you're not and
you just it this look beautiful girl or
beautiful guy or whatever is coming up
to you and they want you and that feels
nice to have attention so the next thing
you know you're in a room with them and
you're hooking up with them or the next
thing you know they're texting you and
you're getting excited and you're saying
things you shouldn't be saying or
sending things you should be sending and
so that is when I say it's not about
whether you love me or not it's not
about whether you love the person and
you don't talk about whether you think
that you're whatever it's not about
anything other than a lack of respect in
some cases it might be that they didn't
love you but in most cases I've noticed
it's just that they don't respect you
they think that you're always going to
be there for them they think that you
are just there at their disposal and
that what do they do is not going to
affect the relationship and that is the
problem when someone doesn't value your
relationship one of my friends was
cheated on and I had advised her about
my situation and I had told her listen
like it's not okay it's not okay you
shouldn't be with someone that does that
to you and they said that it was
different when you're in the situation
and blah blah blah which I get when you
are in a situation and the person cheats
on you and you take them back everyone
the first thing they say is it's
different it's different with me he said
he was sorry it's different with me it's
different when you're in this situation
you don't know the relationship like I
do and I completely understand it is
completely different when you're in a
relationship and you are deciding
whether it should take something back or
not that so many people are blinded by
love they don't want to be a lot of who
wants to break up with her boyfriend
because they cheat on them who isn't it
so much easier to be like oh he said
he's sorry yes like he said he's sorry
so happen
came back because he's sorry he's not
gonna do again I love him yes you do
love him and he might love you back but
if he doesn't respect you and then you
take him back after he does something
like that like that is not okay he
should like you should value yourself
more than you value your relationship
it's so hard I know being in the
situation where you get hurt and someone
cheats on you it feels at the end of the
world and you feel like it's so much
easier to take them back and because
they said sorry you believe them because
half the time they really are sorry I
truly believe that they are sorry but
the lack of respect that they don't have
and I don't think that you taking them
back gives them any more respect for you
I feel like over time as time goes on
the pattern continues and I think that
in the beginning when you take them back
everything will be great
everything will be fine they don't want
to mess up again they don't want to
screw up so they're going to be the
perfect boyfriend or the perfect
girlfriend and then as time goes on
you're gonna get a cat pattern again
they're not going to be sorry about that
forever they've got to move on you guys
are going to move on with your
relationship if your relationship is
stuck on that then she doesn't be in it
at all
you're going to move on from that
situation put it behind you and if the
same thing doesn't happen again he's
still not going to respect you or she's
still not gonna respect you and you the
respect is not going to be grown it's
going to either stay the same or
decrease from my experience I know there
are exceptions to this rule but in
general I just I just got to say
something like this because I've seen it
way too many times and I've experienced
it the reason me and the person that did
that to me broke up was because we did
part ways we did but I realized also
that I was kind of after we broke up I
had realized that after the whole
situation happen and more towards the
end of our relationship things were
going back to how they were in the past
I don't I'm not 100% sir and
had necessarily hooked up with anyone
else but I'm almost 100% sir and not
only to present the like it just the
respect there was lacked and it's not
anyone's fault if a guy cheats on you it
is not your fault take that with me is
not because oh I took him back once of
course he's gonna do it again it's my
fault no it is always his fault
a hundred percent always the person's
fault I hope that you guys take
something out of this and if any of you
guys have been to the situation I hope
that this kind of brings you her a set
of different opinions or something like
I just hope that it helps any single
person going through this and if you do
get in a relationship anything's young
you and you take them back and now
you're watching this and you're like oh
like she's judging me I shouldn't be in
this no I'm not judging you I have been
there you guys I'm not judging you I'm
the last person to judge I am just
trying to give you guys my two cents and
just help you out in any way and I'm not
saying that if you've been in the
situation and you're with them that you
should break it go right now stop this
video and break up with them no I'm just
telling you that the one thing I want
you to take out of this video is that
you should value your worth more than
the words of your relationship because
if someone's not valuing you then you've
already like the relationship is over
