end of fall / ball hall um I was not
about to name this winter fall haul just
because Halloween is over because it is
definitely still fall it is actually 80
degrees outside where I live right now I
live in North Carolina so it like
actually gets cold and it's 80 degrees
outside so definitely not a winter hall

and so I'm just gonna want to like jump
in and show you guys but before I get
started I just want to let you guys know

without further ado let's just get into
the video so the first store that i'll
be showing you guys is Windsor which is
my favorite store if you guys don't know
I love them and I got some stuff from
them so the first thing I got is the
sweater dress so it just looks it has
like a I don't know is this like a cowl
neck or something is like a slouchy
turtleneck and then it's a long sleeve
beige and just a dress I'm planning on
wearing this with like knee-high boots I
think that would be super super cute so
yeah be sure to follow me I can't wait
to wear this I want to wear it today and
then I checked the weather and it was 80
degrees so I opted for a tank top second
thing that I got actually since I just
mentioned it is this tank top so this
tank top is from Windsor I really love
it it's silk and it's lace and it's just
so so pretty and like delicate and I
don't know I just love how it's like
black with lace I just think that's
really cute and then the back also has
lace I've been obsessed with lace things
and I'm just like I love this like cute
tank top and like if you have small
boobs you don't have to wear a bra with
it it's just
it's great the next thing that I got
from Windsor is something that I'll be
wearing to like functions or things that
are way more formal it is this velvet
romper and it has like a choker kind of
attached to it so it's like the neck
part is still there and then it's a deep
v so I'm obsessed with this and it's a
blue velvet like Navy midnight blue
velvet and it's a romper it is so cute
and it's going to be so great to wear
for like formal occasions and I've been
also really loving a velvet I think silk
and velvet are a hundred percent like
the trends of 2016 / 2017 I think it's
gonna like go into 2017 sing that i got
from Windsor was this dress and it's
this green some suede material dress so
this one's really really cute it's a
bodycon so it's pretty like tight but
not too tight and it's just it's like a
kind of like a halter I guess but open
crisscross in the back the next thing I
that i got from windsor i'm obsessed
with and it is this big kind of like
fake fur faux fur coat so it's this red
coat and it is so cute I feel like
Cruella De Vil in this maybe um but yeah
I am obsessed with this I think this is
so like fall I cannot wait to wear this
for like going out or like you can also
like dress it down and like wear with
jeans and honestly like a deed it like
the superstar Dida's are like some
tennis shoes or something I think that
would be really cute or you could dress
it up and wear it with like a really
nice outfit I don't know I just think
there's so many different ways to wear
this look and I'm so excited and it's so
soft and it matches my lips that should
be the thumbnail the next thing that got
from Windsor is this maxi dress so this
is so so cute and I love maxi dresses I
feel like they kind of like we're super
in last year and then no one bought maxi
dresses this year but this one I'm
obsessed with so it is in this black
dress with floral print on it and I just
like it because it's like a v-neck and
then it's one of those like sweet things
I don't know how to describe it like
that crosses over and then the sleeves
are just like so so pretty yeah it's
like a super long dress and I'm
definitely gonna need to get it like
altered or something
and I just really like the colors of it
and the reason why it's a very fall for
me is because of the colors the next
thing that I got from Windsor is this
shirt and it's actually it's actually
not sure it's like a leotard or a onesie
thing so it is black again and it has
like a v-neck again except it's mesh so
it's not like to open um and then it's
just a one piece and then the back also
has like that mesh design on it so like
it's kind of like an open back but the
sleeves are very they're like a bell
sleeves but they open all the way up
until your armpit so it's like very open
I don't know like you can like put your
hands on your hips and like the sleeves
will still be out I don't know how to
describe the next thing that I got from
Windsor is this jeweled skirt so this is
what it looks like I was obsessed with
this I feel like this is perfect for new
years i'm thinking ahead or just like
another like function formal thing or
you can even and you could dress this
down this is a lot harder to dress down
which i think you definitely could if
you were like a white t-shirt and just
sneakers or like flat something like
that i think you could definitely dress
it out the next thing that I got from
Windsor is another dress and it's one of
these silk ones we're not so it's not so
it's velvet it's the other trending
material so it's a velvet dark purple
dress and I actually wanted to wear this
for halloween for like a vampire but I
literally had nothing else that was
vampire e and this isn't even vampire e
so I was like no Natalie you got to be
more creative than that so the next
thing that I got from Windsor is this
bag and I am obsessed with this bag as
well as you can tell I'm obsessed with
everything I got I say that word way too
much and I will get called out on it in
the comments so I know I'm acknowledging
it before you guys like call me out on
it but yeah this bag it's really really
cute and it's just like a plain grey bag
I don't know I just didn't have anything
this color and it's suede and it's like
nice and roomy and moving on to shoes I
think I'm like so in love with the shoes
that I got I've never liked a pair of
shoes more than the three that I got so
the first ones are these like
I've never seen cuter shoot some of you
guys may not like them but like I have
never seen cuter shoes so they are
velvet all the way down and just perfect
in every single way shape and form I'm
obsessed with these like actually
obsessed like the other things I wasn't
like really obsessed with I just like
really really like these obsess love
these so much like oh my gosh he's so
cute i love them excuse that I got I've
already warned and I managed to get them
a little bit dirty which I am very mad
about these are swayed actually can't
really tell on camera but they're suede
and they're very light blue so i really
like these i think these are super
trendy and then the next pair of shoes i
got i'm also in love with and they're
the vince camuto like dupes so much
cheaper version of the vince camuto
knee-high boots because I feel like he's
like the original knee-high boot person
yeah so they're these gray ones cuz I
already have a pair of black ones so
they're these gray ones and they like
tie at the very end of it and they're
over the knee so I love these he's like
go up to my thighs and they're so hot
like I love them I feel like it's great
because like you don't have to wear
pants that was it for all of my windsor
things as you can tell i love them i got
so much i could have just made a halt on
that by itself but the next door that I
got shopped at was seven for all mankind
so that is a pair of like designer jeans
I just got two pairs so I got these
which have rips in them which I love and
they're like at the ankle so i really
like ankle jeans I hate like all but
super long jeans now I'm totally into
the ankle jean the night next pair I'm
actually wearing Oh stand on the chair
ok let's do their these they're just
plain honestly like normal jeans I can
swivel in my chair whoo
alright that's kind of fun and like kind
of scary at the same time the next door
that I shopped out with urban outfitters
so I love Urban Outfitters also and the
first thing that I got was this silk it
kind of looks like a nightgown but it's
not and it's this silk green dress I am
excited to wear this out I think it's so
cute and as like a lace rip and it's
just like so freaking cute I love it and
then the next thing that I got was this
crop top so this was on sale for ten
dollars so I felt like I had to get it
because even though it's summary I don't
really have a lot of like going out
clothes and I feel like going out
clothes are typically more summery and I
can wear this next summer so it was only
ten bucks um it's this like light green
like wash out green super crop top but
it's kind of like crossed at the front
and has these ruffles on the side as the
sleeves so I really like it and then it
has a tie in the back to just like cinch
it up and then next thing I got from
urban it was this hat and it says babe
on it with like little eyelashes and I
think it's like the cutest thing ever I
think it's just so so girly and cute and
I wore it yesterday and I got a lot of
compliments on it denim babe hat can't
go wrong next thing that I got is this
super soft sweater from urban and it
reminds me of free people which makes
sense cuz they're the same company um
but it is just so soft like oh my god
it's just so freaking soft I want to
live in this sweater and I kind of want
it to get a little more chilly so I can
actually wear it like I can't wear any
of these things because it's 80 degrees
outside the next door that I shot that
was sat letak so that's like Kate
Hudson's company and it's like a
subscription but you don't have to have
the sir prescription because I've shore
in my mall so it's like just workout
clothes so the first thing that I got
was this workout tank top and it's just
plain white and has like cross I don't
know it's it's kind of weird to see but
with a sports bra it's really cute
because it shows your app so it shows
your obliques because it's cut out on
the side xing it from fabletics is these
leggings or are these leggings so
they're just playing it length leggings
I think
like the ankle ones and actually if you
spent like forty dollars you got a pair
of leggings for free so I got to
leggings because one of them was free
which is like such a good deal because
leggings in itself for like forty
dollars so like I said I got another
pair of leggings these are the ankle
ones that you got for free and I just
like I I don't know they're so
comfortable you guys fabletics is cheap
but they're actually really good
material because I was really iffy on it
but like I really really liked them and
then the next thing it was this tank top
so it's this purple tank-top and I
thought it was really cute it has like
cutouts and stuff or not cut outs but
like holes in it and I thought this was
awesome for working out that is it for
my Hall you guys I really hope that you
guys enjoyed this give it a thumbs up if
