filming a haul for you guys and actually
I want to spit out my gum before I start
filming this video hey guys so today I
am following a huge haul for you guys
and I am so excited about this I
recently went to California two weeks
ago I went to Santa Cruz because my best
friend moved there and then I'm in San
Francisco for a day and then I went down
to LA with my mom for a late birthday
present and yeah it was a ton of fun and
of course in California I got to do some
shopping because California's a lot of
stores that I don't have in North
Carolina and it's just California and
have like every store ever on every
corner so this just shopping at every
corner I don't know how you guys live
there and don't spend all your money
because I definitely would so yeah so I
bought a ton of things in California and
also just some things like throughout
the past month or so um yeah so I'm just
gonna get into it because it is a lot of
stuff it very very store I'm going to
show you guys is Windsor because you
didn't know how much I love wizard first
thing that I got is this dress is
gorgeous so it has like two triangles
the tops you know and then it has a open
back which is so pretty and then it's
just white and has links at the bottom
of it which i think is so cute and you
just basically tie it with a string and
I just like how simple and like lo he is
and I actually have pictures that I
posted in this so you know go check this
out on Instagram if you want big news I
forgot to say I started a blog and I
said that before I think it's twice but
this time it's legit guys I'm actually
like writing blog posts and I'm also
writing for college fashionista calm I
am so so so excited for that like oh my
gosh I cannot believe that I got chosen
to write for them so I am one of the
couple girls that are writing for North
Carolina State University and that's
where I go to school and
just a blogger for now behind them I
write my articles go live every single
Wednesday if you guys wanna check out my
first one I will link that down below
and also if you guys please please
please check out my blog it's a word
prep it's young wild and free people
wordpress.com so I had that one before
and I used to like post pictures on
there before but I never really like you
said it but now I'm actually gonna use
it I made my favorite blog those two
days ago and I'm about to write another
one today so check that out alright now
we can go back into the hall so my next
choice when Windsor I actually got a
while ago but I didn't show it in my
previous hall so I'm just gonna show it
in this one cuz it's still online so you
guys still got it and all the links will
be down below if you guys want to shop
them yourselves of like all the clothes
that I got um so yeah it's this dress
that reminds me of like 80s Miami like
when I think of it I think it will
Smith's welcome to Miami songs
and then you guys because I you know so
yeah this is what it looks like it's
super pretty it's like we're like at
Ramesh right mint green and it has the
mesh at the in the middle so it's kind
of like a cutout kind of like crop top
and then yeah it has this next just I
got it super tropical it's this I
actually my very first blog post on my
actual blog not college fashionista was
disastrous so if you just wanna check
that out it just reminds me like I am in
a tropical place it's actually a criss
cross on the back I will show you a
picture it is it's like fun but even to
right now our unzipped but like criss
cross is in the back so it's open back
to and the next couple things I got from
Windsor are the arm is this shirt so
it's a white plain shirt with these eyes
on it like aren't those kind of like
it's like not scary but like whoa my boy
that's like me and would not be looking
at my eyes looking at me I got this
shirt I thought it was so huge it's kind
like for the school well no cuz I'm not
gonna wear it just a full but it looks
very beachy it's like a high net which I
love and it's like kinda like it's clear
at the top and then um open back again
cuz like I'm totally into coconuts this
year and I absolutely love that
now the next door is going to be Urban
Outfitters so I love Urban Outfitters
you guys know that and so my first thing
that I got from Urban Outfitters is this
shirt it's a very long shirt so I think
I'm gonna wear it like either as a dress
or looks like shorts underneath but like
in a bra light I don't really know what
I'm gonna wear with that I've been
really loving these and yes so just
playing in it a long shirt / dress I
don't really know
next thing that I got is this dress from
Urban Outfitters and it's another one
that I'm gonna wear a bra with and it's
just a plain blue dress and the material
is super soft as all the materials are
and then it has like a halter back so
you get where you can't wear normal bra
with this so I think I'm gonna wear a
burlap with it and I'm so excited to
wear it because on the mannequin it
looks so good
and I don't know if you guys don't ever
try things on in the store let me know
because I don't think like I don't
remember the last time I was in dressing
her I never ever ever try things on I
just kind of soon they're gonna pick me
and most of time you do an egg they
don't I go in return it later I got it
from Urban Outfitters
obviously all this substance and it is
from it is from it's from Urban
Outfitters okay and it's just a plain
white tank top and I actually wore this
with the bralette so yeah I'm enemies to
invest in some bra let's because I'm
glad I'm wearing like all these are
throw bucks you know ah speaking hug a
wallet so yeah I bought this one at
Urban Outfitters I think it's super cute
and I wore it with that white t-shirt
that I just shows you yes I love it
the next thing I got is this dress and
it's a high-neck which i think is really
cute and i really like high necklines
and it's just kind of like a skater
dresses describe it maybe not maybe I'm
totally wrong
but it has a high neck and I'm really
great to wear it with um like a super
long necklace or like a chunky necklace
or something
and yeah it's just clean gray there are
some stuff that I got is basically all
black white and gray besides what I'm
about to show you so the next thing I
got that is not white or gray or black
is actually very colorful is this it's
not a kimono I actually thought it was
come on oh when I'm on it because I
don't try things on but it's actually
one of those things where you just kind
of drape it around yourself it's so
pretty it has this colors at the bottom
and that's enough to make me want to buy
it just all these pretty colors I really
really love kimonos and just these like
shawls so yeah I thought it was super
cute and it wasn't too excessive Urban
Outfitters so that was always good the
next time I'm going to show you guys is
brandy Melville and we all know how much
just everyone loves brandy melville so
yeah so I got these shorts from Randy I
really like them I actually had them in
my LA morning routine if you guys want
to check that out I'll link it down
below but yeah they're super cute
I wear them to sleep but I'm never
planning on wearing these out on just
chill days put a big white t-shirt yeah
not the most fashionable but shoes are
helping you guys so these are very
versatile they can be worn as PJ's or
just go it out comfy clothes or you can
obviously work out at them you know next
thing I got is just tank top from urban
apps or not prepare ready from brandy
melville and it's just plain a purple
and has you know these common
spaghetti-strap crops tank tops and kind
of a lowish back but I'm pretty sure I
could swear it shots brought with it I
think I got it from me it's this black
and white striped dress and I absolutely
love it so it is just plain black and
white stripe all the way down and it's
just cheap yeah nothing else to really
say about that
the next thing that I got is jeans and I
didn't know Brandi sold pants but these
fit you really nice and they are super
super stretchy they only have two sizes
in their dreams like it's a little
ridiculous anyways I got these pants on
there's plain black and they have a rip
at the knee which I really wanted
someone just a rip SME so I was glad I
found these they are so stretchy so I
guess they could fit a little more than
two sizes but I mean still come on next
thing I got Brandi is this shirt that
says okay but first coffee you know the
typical shirt so yeah I normally do not
like graphic tees really not much like
the ones that's have a lot of writing on
them I'm like ah not really my style but
I really like this one and I figured if
I don't wear it to you often I can
always go to bed because it's like so
comfy and you know coffee so I'm
definitely gonna wear this out but I
could also wear to bed and I could wear
with a lot of things looks just like on
my feminine days I could wear it so yeah
that's why I got the graphic chief then
the next thing is I'm actually think I'm
gonna sell it so I got this plain white
shirt from Brandi and I thought I was
going to return the one I got at urban
so I could wear this one and say this
one was cheaper but then I realized this
was like a tight white shirt and it's
not loose so I couldn't wear it with a
bralette so I might sell this I'm
actually selling like all my clothes on
Poshmark that app so you guys can
definitely check that out I sold a bunch
of things already like the work so not a
bunch but yeah doesn't check out my
Poshmark because I'm selling a ton of
clothes for super cheap next I'm going
to show you is free people and so this
is one hat I got some great people and
it's show you I'm obsessed with hats
like I really really love these and I
really like how it has silver right here
I thought that was so cute and this is
also in my la morning routine
if you guys want to check that out then
I think that I got it this tenner a
poncho thing I really really like it
when I wear some shorts and some booties
and so cute
so it's just this poncho and it's like
blue and gray it has big sleeves on it
and then it just kind of goes out like
that and yeah I don't know how else to
explain it but it's really cute and it
was on sale so I really love this color
too so they had a white and brown one of
this but I love it's like the indigo
color it's a lot prettier in a lot more
unique the next thing I got every people
is this chain top which oh my gosh I
love it
it is um so it looks like this so it's
like a high-neck but it looks like a
bando underneath like you thinking that
you have something else on
it's like comes attached but at work
like it doesn't look like it's attached
but it's actually tack right up here so
it gives an illusion that you're trying
to wearing like a bralette and this is
the bra way and you're super stylish for
thinking to poke put like a high-neck
burlap entertain table Wow wouldn't have
thought of that well you didn't think of
it it's pretty people better for you so
yeah I really like it
and the next door is Nasty Gal my very
first item from Nasty Gal
ever i've never shopped there I've never
shopped online and I've never been
inside a store so there's my very first
time in the store we went to the Third
Street Promenade and I wish I blogged
the trick but I totally didn't excite an
idiot but thumbs this video up if you

one of those that gray shirt I got from
Urban Outfitters to flip the bread
slasher except this one's a shirt but
I'm gonna wear it with
underneath and a tank top because it's
like totally see-through and this is
like super cool like it like opens up
like I don't even know how to describe
it it like goes all the way to the floor
but it's so new and it's so different I
am so excited to wear it next thing I
got from Topshop it's this denim shirt
and I know you must be thinking and
denim skirts are so not in but this one
is so yes it's demonstra with its silver
buttons on it and it's just white and it
goes out like a line skirt so excited
we're it I think it is so so cute I
really like white bands the next thing
that I got is this tank top from a short
in Manhattan Beach I don't remember the
name of it but it was a very cute store

and I got it's that's how pornea on it
and I just thought it was really cute
the next thing that I got is this tank
Bert this is so not to top is it a
sports bra from Nike and it's just a

guess if you want me to do a fitness
routine thumbs this video up too so I
know what kids want me to do next I got
the leggings that are like heaven on
your pan or heaven on your legs like
these are the most comfortable luggage
I've ever tried out in my life
I'm never going to take them off ever um
yeah there's these leggings and they are
just plain black and they're prompt and
they're like the comfiest things in the
whole wide world and I might not even
like workout and then I might just live
in them you know just casual like
there's so no song but wait there's more
guys I know
so first let's start off with the shoes
so I got I fell to the top of the
Burke's
so I have fallen under the Berk spell
you guys I used to hate Birkenstocks I
used to think I paint dust is flying
everywhere
whoo I used to hate Birkenstocks and I
thought they were so ugly I was like it
works but now I really like them so call
me a bandwagon fan whatever I totally am
I admit it
but I like these so I just got these
Bert's and they're just matte black
which I love and I have actually quite a
bit so yeah I really like these and 11

like them or not
okay the next year's I got our target
and they are these wedges I actually got
these the day of my formal so yeah I got
these for my formal the day of my formal

cheap and they're the perfect summer
wedge and I've worn them with the
tropical dress from Windsor that so you
can see a blog post on these this one is
my actual first super heavy but it's so
cute I am actually in love with this
purse so it is this bag from Windsor
it's a bucket bag and I'm a successive
bucket bags so I don't have it tight but

tighten it like a legit bucket bag but I
don't have a fight it is so cute it

one today at Target and it's just this
backpack I really wanted a backpack so I

literally just got it like 10 minutes
ago and I got a bathing suit from Target
so it's black and has neon straps and it

neon stripes on the side so yep pretty
plain but so cute

from Windsor at this choker but it came
in a set with this choker this flower
one and this yin and yang one I do not
believe they give and yang whatever it's
