the Chelsea Market that area and we just
ate as I Chloe looks super good did you
guys like it yeah
like none of us are vegan and it's a
vegan restaurant for those you guys that
don't know but it's really really good
and today it's like the only sunny day
so I want to go to the Highline just
like all outside at the it's like a
sample sale and Chelsea in the Chelsea
Market and it has a bunch of free people
stuff and everything is like the jeans
are like $25 the shirts are like $15 I
got so much stuff
I'm not buying all of this but I'm
deciding on what to buy but this is it -
it's like pretty big I mean nice average
size but everything is like so cheap and
like everything is what's out now it's
not like old stuff the famous naked man
that I thought was real for the longest
time you guys are ever here trick your
friends tell him he's real because it
seriously looks so real
I thought he looks so real we're going
to dirty underwear Oh Oh Mike's just
like like hear that noise just reading a
verse or ten out of ten on the artist
sunless
so today is the second day that we're
here and we are all just getting ready
right now this is our Airbnb it's
actually a total mask at your visit
super messy we have four girls in here
two beds no mirror this is the situation
sir but we're handling it though but
yeah we're just getting ready um we made
reservations at a brunch place in like
Upper East Side area near Central Park
because that's where we're going to be
today
today I have a photoshoot with Shelley
so super excited about that she was in
my blog laughs I was here I took
pictures of me and grace and yeah that's
about what we're doing today but I'm
wearing camo jacket it was supposed to
rain before get super cloudy outside
like there's no Sun but it doesn't say
it's going to rain anymore so cross your
fingers that it doesn't rain cloth panel
appear it rained not fun so I hope it's
honoring this time um yeah I'm wearing a
camo jacket from Banana Republic I got
this a super long time ago a Windsor
tank top denim jeans and wear black
booties in my hair is the classic top
knot that I always do my caliber by
riding you went to Sephora you know a
girl goes to Sephora when her hands come
out looking like this are at
Bloomingdale's right now and we are
going to the free we went to like the
free people section and I where me and
my sister have gone here bunch and like
have found the best deals like like over
half off of free people and like in the
stores still full price suppose
department stores have their own sale
now the free people section is cut into
like a tenth of what it used to be so
it's really sad it's like one rack of
stuff and then the rest is like mixed
brands but it's okay
that's assignments I shouldn't go
shopping so it's fine it's fine Central
Park this is a good picture spot and
then taking photos here so pretty
since I'm work is beautiful and that fun
fact this is also living in New York and
it's an apartment building can you
imagine living there yeah me neither
we barely afford a name so
hello everyone so I don't know if you
can hear me but I just got done with a
photo shoot with Shelley and I worked
with her before she's amazing go follow
her on Instagram she takes such good
pictures it's really cold so I was in
like the tank tops the whole time
because she wanted to do a more like
summery look and toes wearing a tank top
little prime click really really cold
today you're supposed to be warm but
like it's not at all and now it started
to rain and it was supposed to rain and
then they was supposed to not rain and I
was raining again so my sister and my
friends went to the met while I was
taking photos so walking there right now
must know this AB and Central Local
right along Central Park but guess I'm
walking to the met right now just a
little cold and rainy but that's ok I
love walking around the city by myself
so I like it I like I don't know I just
I could definitely get used to it we're
trying to find a good dinner place so hi
we're so I was posting this before so I
could have asked you guys like where
should we go to dinner we have no idea
where to go
oh my god it's so cold okay good morning
guys it is the next morning and it is
some day I look really good things but I
just did a full cycle cloth there's my
first time doing it and then we died it
was really good though I really liked it
I could never do that as my main workout
just because I don't like cardio that
much but and I don't like doing the same
staying and I feel like cycling like yes
we did arms so it was like two pound
weights and stuff like that so I feel
like I don't know I'd rather do the gym
and cycling I couldn't do like just
cycling but it was a really really good
class I really enjoyed it
she was fine if you're ever in Brooklyn
or in New York in general they have some
all over but I went to the Brooklyn one
and your first times is only $20 so yes
you like it
I did what I died I don't know how I
would be walking right now yeah I'll see
you like there are today where that was
awesome yeah we had Selena's class so
give the other ever in the area
definitely go if you've gone before let
me know if you guys like it or what your
favorite work um is the oculus building
annex this is called underneath one
world trade it all connects just like a
giant not like really cool shopping mall
and it's brand new
who can tell you how high you are we
your your all is so cool tell she
and
Wow I wish was a sunny day
okay hey so cool better than Empire
snake it is so hey you're at one World
Trade Center or one world Observatory I
think it's technically called and we're
the top this is super cool getting up
here the elevator was so cool like they
just put on a show for us six forty
seconds to get to the top and we're I
think Ellsbury on floor 105 is one of
that 102 this view is sometimes cloudy
today which is unfortunate but still a
nice view and I've never been here
before so those challenges I personally
think it's better than the Empire State
Building so here in New York's at first
time I would recommend this over at the
Empire State Building we just wanted to
taller to you can see the Empire State
Building and also it's indoors so if
you're coming on like a crappy day
you're not going to be like freezing
cold because I'm pretty sure Empire
State Building just little fence right
yeah I sense it's not like inside like
this yeah they're jumpin but yeah it's
really putting it and I'm happy that I'm
here here at the Brooklyn Bridge Park
I've been here a bunch of times before
but they have never been here so I want
to take them
so it's like them into the ark in a
while it's really really pretty at some
of the best ways you can see the city
like the view of the city I really love
coming here but yes we're doing right
now we're taking pictures viewing the
bridges seeing Manhattan and super foggy
day last time I was here was also really
really foggy so I think I just break the
bad weather but we're doing here - never
been here highly recommended too lazy to
canvass but this with you I'm sitting
down on the floor my New York trip is
ending and so often and the vlog here
but I want to play right now and there
is only 16 people on this plane like I
just counted all the heads of it this
people ever remember oil and film
gasps there's my Petros and everyone has
their own is possible yes fifteen of us
I'm here in subby we're thinking like
because I have a pointer rolling from
Oregon on Monday night now only 15
others but be sure to just add some up
again like this I'm going to be starting
a blog tales of summer if you have any
ideas for what I should call it let me
know
but it looks guys thank you so much for
