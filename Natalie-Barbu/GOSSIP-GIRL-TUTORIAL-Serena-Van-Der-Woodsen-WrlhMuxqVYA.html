exciting video for you guys is a Serena
van der Woodsen from Gossip Girl

and personally I think Blake Lively is
the prettiest actress in Hollywood
that's just my opinion there are many
beautiful actresses in Hollywood but I
think that Blake Lively is B prettiest
and the like most naturally pretty like
I feel like a lot of the Hollywood
actresses and actors they are very
gorgeous but like they're only gorgeous
cuz of all like the makeup that you have
on
but I feel like Blake Lively is a very
natural pretty like she took all her
makeup she'd still be really pretty I am
the biggest gossip girl fan ever I am
obsessed with it I love the clothes I
love the show I love the makeup I love
the hair I love everything on it I love
the characters the actors the guys on it
and everything I even huge Gossip Girl
fan I'm also going to beat you Inc
Gossip Girl um externa bansuri would
send inspiring clothing and likes for
Blair Moldovan smart clothing and Blair
Waldorf inspired makeup serena has a
very shimmery very naturally pretty I am
like very naturally glowy skin she also
has kind of like a darker like eyeliner
at the top but not like heavy eyelid
eyeliner like Jenny on Gossip Girl
even though she's not you're not anymore
but um it's not like that you know
also um Gossip Girl is like it's just
such a good show for inspiration for
like fashionistas and everything like

you guys like Gossip Girl and who your
favorite couple on it is because I love
knowing that if you guys like Dan and
Blair why that's all I have to ask for
you why like they're terrible together I
hate them together Chuck and Blair all
the way hard okay no oh and I also
wanted to share with you guys before I
ended this video or ended this
introduction
look how cool my nails are look at
that do you see it I got that nail ink
magnetic nail polish at Sephora you just
pee your nails one coat wait for it to
dry
paint then another coat and then they
have a magnet on the cap of it and then
you just like stick the magnet over it
and it creates this AG ripple effect
look at that here let me see if you can
isn't that so cool you guys should get
it they come in gold silver and purple I
got the purple one just because it's the
most like noticeable like difference and
silver it's two and gold is just really
really cool but they didn't have gold
where my tap my support they only had
silver and purple and I thought purple
was a bit nice and silver so umm I
really like it let me know if you guys
like it too and if you guys got it and
want you guys think of it um hope you
enjoy this video and let's get started
first we're going to start off with
priming your eyes I am using a Urban
Decay eyeshadow primer potion this is
the shimmery one I don't really know
what it's called but it looks like this
the shimmery one I do recommend just
because Serena van der Woodsen has a
very shimmery eye all the time but yeah
it's a bit darker also that's why I'm
gonna incorporate the eyeliner but
anyways so I would start off with the
shimmery base because the shimmer eNOS
is kind of like her signature I feel
like she always looks like a nice
shimmery eyeshadow on but like not
overdoing it and then after that I redid
that after that you are going to get a
very gold shadow I am using in peppa
impeccably rich by Mac this is a Big
Bounce shadow I like these a lot more
just because I don't know I feel like
they're literally versatile like you can
use them a lot more I don't know I like
it oh well I've as you can tell used
quite a bit of it because I use this
like all summer so you're just gonna
want to take it with your finger do like
a tiny bit just like this much and then
just put it all over your eyelid as you
can tell it's very very very cold I love
it and this is so like you can use this
for so many things I'm
this is my highlight before I'm used to
it like highlight like cheekbones and
keep its bow and like underneath your
eyebrows and I used it like for so many
different things like just to give a
nice sheer glow if you it's kind of hard
to use that as a highlight but I managed
to do it I liked a foundation where like
if you took a while because I kind of
messed up but anyways you can definitely
use it for that too
um next you are going to want to take a
matte eyeshadow in all that glitters
this is actually an eyeshadow looks like
this it's very very very shimmery hence
all that glitters it's very glittery
you're just going to want to take a
crease brush this is the Mac - too -
yeah - to do just swirl it in there and
then just apply a little bit to your
crease not to overdo it this is just
going to give it a bit more depth and
dimension because Serena also is a very
natural kind of look at the same time so
yeah
once you put that on your upper lash
line oh and by the way notice how I
didn't tug at my eyes was that causes
wrinkles and it's a ton more easier just
to put it like because then you actually
see like what its gonna look like when
you're actually like looking someone
face to face so if you just open your
eyes and just like glide it along it's a
lot easier like it doesn't like poke you
in the eye or anything um next you're
going to want to take a pencil brush
which is right here
um this Mac pencil brush in the number
219 and just smudge it just a little bit
not too much though and now you are
going to add a very voluminous in
mascara because her eyelashes are very
voluminous but not like false lashes you
know and first you're gonna curl it and
I let me pull an eyelash curler in the
bathroom so BRB fan back take your
eyelash curler and just hold it there
for about like five seconds seven
seconds something like that
now that your eyelashes are all curled
you are going to want to take a
voluminous mascara voluminous million
lashes i am using by l'oreal looks like
that here's the wand as you can tell
it's gonna be luminize a lot and just
put it on your lashes once you're done
with the mascara you're going to want to
take your favorite blush I am using NARS
orgasm serena is a very peachy yet pink
blush on her so it's very nice flush and
this is the perfect one as you can tell
mine is very old because the mirror fell
off and everything but I can like put it
back on but and I have used so much of
it this is the first time I've ever hit
pan on anything so that's this a lot on
this product and I'm just letting Sonia
Kashuk blush brush swirl it in there
it's not hard to get blush because like
I can't directly get it from the middle
but it's just rolling smile I just like
to smile like this not like a full blown
out smile don't worry don't really smile
like that in real life
but just because like it kind of pops
your apples even more because I don't
really have cheekbones so if I go like
this it's just like this whole thing if
I go like yeah it kind of shows my
apples okay
that was random so just have whatever
you think to point your apples and
directly put it on there
now that you're done with blush you are
going to want to take a highlighter I'm
gonna use more like a shimmery because
Serena always looks like she just
stepped out of like a tanning salon or
something but looks gorgeous like excuse
me it just came out from like a beach
trip or something I'm going to be using
Swami brown highlighter shimmer brick
comeback in the color apricot
and it looks like this look how
beautiful that is
it's so pretty I'm just going to take a
fan brush this is my bare minerals it's
just like a like stroke fan and just one
two three four back and forth and apply
it over the blush
and then just like one stroke kind of
ply it up here just lightly the bridge
of your nose forehead and chin just
where you think like you want highlights
and definition you know you can put it a
bit more in places that you feel like
you need sorry um but yep and now moving
on to lips which is also in my bathroom
I'm sorry sir you know so you know
always has a very pink shimmery not
shimmery but a very pink glossy lip so
what better lip color to use the NARS
Turkish Delight so that looks like it's
very pretty and you're just gonna open
it put around the lips now that is it
for the Serena van der Woodsen tutorial
I really hope that you enjoy this and
keep watching because I will do a Blair
Waldorf tutorial as well so thanks keep
sending me more requests and everything
