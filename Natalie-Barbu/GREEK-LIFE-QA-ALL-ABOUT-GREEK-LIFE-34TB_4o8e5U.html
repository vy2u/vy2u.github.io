today I'm coming with a Greek life video
this was so so requested you guys every
single time I talk about my sorority you
guys are always like oh like what's that
or can you a great great video I don't
know if I should brush wah wah and I
kind of not really address it in my
college advice video which or 15 things
I learned for my freshman year and I'm
going to do College advice video but
it's all dedicated to Greek life so
let's just get started
actually before we get started I want
you guys to pause this video after I say
this and my sorority actually just did a
recruitment video and we just like to
put it on YouTube so if you guys will
please check that out that would mean so
much to me if you guys could click on it
I will give you a sneak peek right here
but it is awesome I'm I love it
obviously because I'm into sorority but
I think it's like the editing is so good
and I think it's funny cuz like of
course me on YouTube I'm like oh my god
the editing is so great like of course
that's what I notice but yeah so make
sure you guys check that out and if you
guys do please write in the comments
below that you guys saw it or whatever
and I think they'll give you a good
taste of the kind of work Greek life is
before I get into this video because if
you don't know what it is or if you're
kind of confused if you want to rush or
not maybe this video will kind of just
show you it's just supposed to be like
hey here's our chapter I'm just like
doing sisterhood things and stuff like
that like this video and compiled into a
video so yeah definitely check it out
let me know what you guys think in the
comments below and then yeah if you want
a thumb set video up that would mean so
much to me and all the girls that are in
it which is like basically our whole
chapter so yeah make sure you do that
and if you do leave in the comments
below so I'll just take a minute to
pause this video right now so you
just hit pause and then come back right
so just salsa music alright now that
you've watched that video I'm going to
tell you a couple of I'm gonna answer
some questions that you guys have about
Greek life and these are not any like
specific one person asked me it's just
what I've seen a bunch in the comments
and I just wanted to stress just to
maybe from like a person that's in it
one of you instead of just someone
that's outside of it so let's just get
stuck so my first question is what is
Greek life / what's a sorority so many
people ask this because I'm pretty sure
Greek life is only in the US maybe
Canada but Greek life is basically just
a community of people because it's
sororities and fraternities return these
are for boys sororities are for girls so
I'm going to talk about strory
so basically when a sorority is is just
a group of girls that come together to
do philanthropy events to service events
which is yes service events um they'll
do social events they'll have a lot of
sisterhood bonding activities because in
sororities you're called sisters and
then in fraternities you're brothers so
basically that's what it is just a group
of girls that come together that form a
sisterhood and do a bunch of things
together it's basically just like any
other club that you join that guys do
stuff together and you guys have things
in common and you like the people in the
club that's why you joined the club so
yeah and especially if you really like a
certain sororities philanthropy or you
really like the sisterhood events that
they do you know that's like a reason to
join SAP one question number two is how
expensive is it money is such a big
issue when joining a sorority or not and
it's totally understandable as it should
be because you don't want to just waste
your money on something but if you do
have the financial means to do it I
definitely would consider it but there's
also a lot of scholarships so I know a
lot of girls in my sorority like I don't
know the exact number but a lot of them
have scholarships from
and by the way I didn't say what
sorority on it I mean it is a total
alpha guys it just did not know yeah so
that's the sorority I manage
oh they a lot of them get scholarships
you can also have financial aid with
them so it really depends on the
specific sorority some schools have
crazy cause like some schools I think
are like ten thousand dollars a semester
like that's insane
mine is not like that so yeah a lot of
them it really depends on the school but
keep in mind there's always financial
aid and the scholarships to through it
like scholarships for tuition also to it
the third question is are you buying
your friends this no one's literally
asked me are you buying your friends but
I've heard a lot of times when people
bash sororities they're like oh you're
just buying friends and I'm not gonna
lie when I was in high school I did not
want to join a sorority I was so like no
I'm not for anyone
I'm not preppy I'm not like oh my god
which I feel like is the typical
sorority girl like stereotype I guess
which I will also address but no I did
not want to join one and I also was like
oh my god you're spying your friend no
you're not
this think of it as any other club like
if you join the color or the engineering
Club at school I would still have to pay
dues for that like you just need to pay
dues for anything that you're in or else
how do you expect to go to socials and
how do you expect to host things really
you need use for basically what it does
at the house the houses are normally
really nice
and you need use to maintain the house
reduce to just like living in a dorm or
whatever you need to move super that so
no it's not paying for your friends I
never gave any of the girls money and be
like hey be my friend
it is not paying for friend it's just
you need to just maintain everything and
keep running and Greek life in general
just has some fees that you need but
yeah it's not paying for your friends
like if you don't want to join one
that's totally fine but it's not paid
for your friends what do you do in a
sorority so I kind of touched on it but
I guess I'll go into more detail so what
are you in a sorority basically you have
all looks like each key point selects
philanthropy like Zetas philanthropy and
breast cancer awareness so we raise a
ton of money for breast cancer awareness
and we have so many philanthropy events
like of the month of October is
obviously the most popular because but
like all throughout the year we have
little things that will raise money for
and we frisbee ton of money I don't know
exact numbers but I will definitely like
run that out but I know it is a lot of
money that we've raised and then you
also like with the political events you
have to like help out you to help raise
money you know and you help out with all
of your like all of your sisters like
your sorority sisters so that is really
fun like it's not like oh I have to do
this and anyways like none of us I don't
think
I mean maybe sometimes we'll have a bad
day but I don't think anyone's like able
I don't want to help raise money for
breast cancer awareness like that sucks
no and then also um we have like social
events so that was function so you bring
a date or we have mixers and mixers are
like functions is kind of like sorority
prom that's what I would think of it and
then um mixers is you and a sorority and
fraternity
mix so that's like they have like a
party together that's basically what a
mixer is and normally their themes and
themed parties are so much fun and then
also we'll have service events so we
need to have a specific amount of
community service hours a semester to be
in later to be like an active member so
I think we need to have like 12 hours a
semester or something like that so
there's all of the time service
opportunities like there's a service
opportunity all the time none of it is
required again it's not required like if
you want to be able to go to function
you might need to have a certain amount
of hours but it's not like no one's
forcing you to do anything it's
literally all about how active you want
to be and that was kind of my problem
last year I was not that active in it
this year I'm trying to become so much
more active and I'm like literally
enjoyed at 20 times more my freshman
year I was just like I liked it but I
wasn't I didn't love it and now this
year I really really love it and I'm
like so happy that I did it and I think
everyone's second year people say is
always was a really great one which it's
honestly because first semester I was
not involved at all and that was totally
my fault it's like when they had things
I was like Emma I don't want to go and
like that's such a bad attitude to have
and if you don't want to go and then
don't join you know which I should have
like gone mom I should not have joined
but like I really should have been more
involved because I would have enjoyed it
so much more but this year I'm Way more
bold and I love it so much and like
going to dinner at the house is so much
fun and everything is just like I like
it so much ones here a lot of people ask
question of what is a big so a big is a
big sister basically that's what it's
big a short for big sister and what it
is is in essen where you have a big and
little grand bag it's like a family I
remember before rush I was like that is
so stupid like what is that I remember
thinking that and now I'm like I'm not
like sling us
like crying when I met my big like it
wasn't anything like that for some
people it is but for me I was just like
like so happy because my big is actually
like my friend and that's how it is like
your big is not a random person I hope
not it's like a friends it's like a
really close friend that you look up to
that's all it is you don't need to do
anything with that like it's nothing
really
I don't that's literally all day so it's
just someone that you look up to it's
kinda like your little family in your
sorority and you guys are typically
really close and that's basically old
it's like I don't know how to explain it
question is should I brush so I think
that obviously it depends on the person
I don't know who's watching this video
but if you are considering brushing
definitely do it 100% do it if you don't
like it you can draw that's always
thanks think about if you were asked
absolutely get sororities and you know
they go hate it then we might not like
you can still try it I definitely
recommend trying it and then dropping if
you hate it but let's figure out hundred
percent against it then okay that's fine
don't you may need in rush sophomore
year realize you want to be in it but I
definitely recommend people rushing I
think it's really good you get to meet
so many people during rush
I cannot imagine not knowing all the
girls that I met like through brush like
I that's just I can't imagine not having
met them I feel like I was literally
know five people at school if I didn't
go through it but that's also because of
where I spend my time but I definitely
recommend rushing because worse comes to
worse you hate it and then you drop and
that's it like and then I wanted to cuz
I like debunk threes
sorority stereotypes of sorority girls
and they kind of annoy me because I am
Ana sorority so when people see that
maturity they automatically think these
things and its really annoying number
one is that sorority girls all they care
about is partying and all
is drink and they're always drunk and
whatever no that's not true like yeah
we're in college so a lot of sorority
girls do go out and they do party but
look at people not in Greek life do they
go out and party yeah so it's not just
sororities like I don't know why that's
a stereotype really I think it's because
movies but it's literally just college
that's a college Serio type and you
don't have to like there are girls that
live in the house that never is like but
don't like drinking and don't like going
out parties and stuff and that's totally
fine no one cares I'm was like oh my god
you're not drinking like in you're in a
sorority that's that's so weird
no no one cares about that like it's
literally just an individual person like
there's no difference between a sorority
girl in a non sorority girl in terms of
whether they party hard or not like no
number two is that they are dumb and
that won't see so much because again
it's kind of like the same thing like we
all go to the same school here we all
thought I in like I don't know why you
think I'm stupid and that you're smart
no we have a couple like a good amount
of engineering majors in mind
I'm also an engineering major we have a
good amount engineering majors we have
so many biology majors we have so many
and not that saying that some majors are
dumb but it's like we have girls that
study for hours and hours a day and
they're in a sorority like it's not that
hard it's all about how much time you
put into it and I'm telling you like
only you will only be really busy with
your sorority a couple times a year like
during rush and then during like the big
events and stuff but it's not like an
all year thing like oh my god I just
need to spend like 20 hours I mind dirty
doing sorority things like no you will
have so much time to do everything else
I promise you number three is that
sorority girls are fake and I'm going to
tell you that they are fake girls
everywhere
I think that's the theme of this there
are people like this everywhere yeah
there might be some fake girls and
sororities they don't join that sorority
if they're fake or don't join a sorority
if you think everyone is fake but
they're not all face like that's just
very ignorant to assume they are not all
fake and there are fake people in
sororities too so that was kind of just
