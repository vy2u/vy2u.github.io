I am filming a get ready with me video
so today is actually my semi-formal for
my sorority if you guys don't know what
that is it's basically just kind of like
another high school band it's like a
prom or homecoming or something like
that
but for your sorority so I'm really
excited I wanted to share this with you
guys because I love my outfit and
normally for functions I get ready in
like ten minutes and I find out what I'm
gonna wear like an hour before we need
to leave so it's nothing really like
special any other functions but percent
me for some reason I just want to look a
lot better a little bit I want it to
look a lot better and I also really just
love my outfit like I don't own anything
like this I normally don't wear things
like this and it is so different because
I'm actually wearing a romper you guys
will see but yeah I just show you guys
how I did my hair and my makeup my hair
I maybe did in five minutes or less and
then my makeup I did in about 20 minutes
so it did not take very long at all and
I really like the way it looks it is of
currently about 1 o'clock and my semi is
probably at like 9:30 but I really
wanted to film it for you guys and it's
in the light so I just decided to do it
now so if anything my makeup is very set
though I like primed in it with a primer
and a spray so it should be fine but
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video

I'm home for the day and I went to some
party yesterday but yeah now I'm just
rambling so let's just get into this
video and make sure that you thumbs it
up
standard flowers and
to my dreams never found them never do
whatever means I was waiting for a site
open that it would be fine
I was waiting on the line or anybody

I was waiting for a sight reason that it
was me time I was waiting on the light
that it would be fine
but the darkness my hand shaking in fear
standard flower than
to my dreams never found them ever do
whatever means I was waiting for a
science or business that it would be
fine I was waiting on the line hoping
that it would be funny

fine
