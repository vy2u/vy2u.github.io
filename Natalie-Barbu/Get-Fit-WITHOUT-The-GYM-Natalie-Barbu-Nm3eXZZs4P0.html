having to use the gym yeah we'll keep
watching then videos like it's really
weird okay guys it's not only here and
today we are filming her I am filming I
filmed I edited here it is my fitness
video so I wanted to do another fitness
video because I liked my other ones I
did the school year and since it's
summer I feel like it's appropriate rate
one so I want to do another one and so
this one at first though is going to
make it serious and like like every
other one but then I was like I want to
do something more creative and yeah so
while I was filming and I was just like
okay change of changes mind all my
outfits that I am wearing are from adore
me and you guys know I love adore me
because I put them in a lot of my videos
I always have hauls from them I just
like shop online a lot and that seems to
be a store that I shop online life all
of those are coming at you guest
actually it's like a subscription
service so every single month
you get a set for however much you pay
so for 3995 you get whole set and it
could be underwears bras swimsuits I
have it all so this time I haven't tried
their fitness gear so I want to try the
fitness outfits and fitness helmets are
so expensive and then the fitness habits
that I got are Lululemon quality but
like not Lululemon prices at all like my
whole outfit is probably the stock is
probably the price of one Lululemon sock
quality is amazing I really really loved
it highly recommend you guys checking
out I will have all of my links down
below because this isn't an elephant
video so I didn't want to talk about it
it's about the actual video but like you
guys the yield they're really really
cute I have a lot of different outfits
and I'm obsessive Fitness stuff because
walking to class and just lounging and
stuff that's basically all I wear and
just working out I've been working out a
lot this summer this video is a video
for how to get fit without going to the
gym so I'm going to start the video and
the first rdfa without going to the gym
is actually you all you have to do is
look up any fitness trails and near you
and there's a lot in surround it in like
so many cities almost every city has a
fitness trail somewhere you just gotta
look it up so good thing you know Google
in your back pocket but all you have to
do is go and we'll go finish trail and
go and they literally tell you what to
do like it has directions it's basically
a free jam it just outside within nature
the next one that I want to share with
you guys another way to kind of how to
get saved without a gym is to do yoga
outside and I say outside because yoga
classes are very expensive and people
love doing hot yoga
so how yoga is like a lot of people love
doing I like doing hot yoga and classes
for hot yoga can be really expensive so
the class is near me are about $13 per
class which is so not affordable
so it's specially for a college they
don't like me so you can bring hot yoga
all you have to do is get a YouTube
video in your phone get an app that has
yoga there's so many resources that you
can use I like using sworkit but like
you can literally use anything there's
so many online videos that you can do
and all I have to do is bring it outside
because they typically keep the
temperature outside like or in hot yoga
at 97 degrees sometimes they're gonna
like 103 but I don't know about you guys
but where I live it gets to a hundred
degrees in the summer so if you do it
outside it's the same thing is doing hot
yoga
so that's your tip from me
next way to get fit with alpha janet is
to walk your dogs and I tried filming
this and making it cute and like at
first this is when I was planning on
doing the tip company I wanted it to
look really cute and then my dogs just
won't cooperate with me they won't like
they just are slow and actually they
just went on a walk before I took them
out so I guess they were extra tired of
it but yeah they're just like slow old
dogs and I love them with all my heart
but they're not good for videos
go to the left
Ola Keys ping I'm Zim Danza Vinci
DaVinci walking your dogs is just such a
great way to kind of stay healthy
without even realizing it cuz you can do
it multiple times a day and also it
keeps you dogs healthy because dogs
can't really easily at least my dogs do
so that's when we take them on a lot of
walks and feed them healthy things and
stuff that's different story
but yeah they keep your dog happy and
you healthy so walking your dogs with an
extra bun and if your dogs can handle it
unlike mine you can take them out on
runs or bike rides just obviously it
depends on the type of pet that you have
but walking my dogs and one of my
favorite things to actually get fit
without realizing it like it's not
something I don't rely just on walking
my dogs but if you walk your dogs you
gain those steps you get the walk at a
fast pace it like really increases your
heart rate so that's definitely a good
tip for you guys just take a lap around
your neighborhood and then the last way
to stay healthy this one is like the
weirdest thing I've ever filmed I always
like cracking up of myself is this is so
my personality and so my type of humor
but it is to play pokemon go and I've
been playing that a lot um not a time
but I'm like very new to it so I'm only
level 7 which I know like some people
are on level 20 like my boyfriend who is
going is on level 20 so whatever but
yeah so playing pokemons go is just
obviously don't do this as your main
workout but it is a way to kind of get a
little healthier alright guys today
we're doing alright guys so today we're
going to be hunting
some Pokemon and we're gonna be running
around and just looking for some Pokemon
and shooting our pokeballs at them to
catch them all so there's a pledge by
the fountain it says I'm close enough to
finally get some pokeballs
that's what there's there's a frittata
over there which we don't want to get
because there's way too many of those
and there's a piggy over there which
again we don't want that one but I see
that there is a Charmander over there
sounds a little better so let's go
all right I got him
Dania he escaped all right let me show
you one more time I caught him so I'm
trying to hatch this egg so I really
gotta since I got around five kilometers
to get this egg to hatch it so we're
gonna go on a little journey cuz I want
to see what pokemon is in this bag
thanks for catching them all with me
guys remember team blue and let me show
you guys like pokemon trainer outfit so
shirt just cuz it's my team just wearing
that color without me it's a super cool
spandex shorts these are from adore me
and super cool a sports bra also from
adore me they match it's a set guys cuz
like comes in a set awesome deal shoes
just any old running shoes you got to
have your running shoes on as you saw
there's a lot of running involved in
catching some pokemon so hope you guys
enjoyed this episode of catching pokes
morning catching them all join us next
time remember go team blue go mystic
whoo
next time let's see if we can get to
Pikachu and I don't know tournament that
well but like guys I was the biggest
Pokemon fan I was little I didn't battle
like I didn't play cards like I didn't
battle the cards but I had so many cards
I think I have like at least probably a
thousand cards maybe maybe not that much
but I have a thick binder full of cards
with like the sheet protectors and some
you stick your cards in each slot you
know I was like obsessed me and my said
my older sister and my cousin were
obsessed so we still have all of those
and maybe one day I'll get rich off of
them who knows I hope that you guys
enjoyed this video and leave a comment
below if you thought this was like the
weirdest thing that you've ever watched
or if you thought it was funny or if you
were just like um it was a cool video
leave going down below I would love it
to know make sure that you guys to check
out or me though because they have the
cutest cutest cutest workout gear of all
time I really really love them and just
the fact that you get them as a set
because I hate mixing and matching like
I hate having to do that work myself so
if they do it for you and getting up for
you workout outfit every month that's so
nice like that can be your alternative
and that can be your incentive to work
out
