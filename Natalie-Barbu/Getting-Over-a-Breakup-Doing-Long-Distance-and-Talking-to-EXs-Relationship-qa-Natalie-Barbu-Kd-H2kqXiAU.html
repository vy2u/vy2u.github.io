today I am with Callie she came to visit
me in LA and she was my roommate last
year in case you guys didn't know and
she also has a YouTube channel so I'm
gonna have her link down below cuz we
were feeling a little collab while we're
here I wanted to film a relationship Q&amp;amp;A
anything about boys dating literally
anything along that sort just normally
when I ask Q&amp;amp;A it's all about me like
everyone asks questions like how's your
major what do you want to do after
college and stuff like that and like I
love answering those questions but I
feel like you guys know me pretty well
so I really wanted to do just like a guy
advice video because I have never filmed
one like I don't think I filmed a good
Q&amp;amp;A maybe I have once before but it's
been a long times also if you're new to
my channel hi I'm Natalie I film like
lifestyle videos vlogs College videos
ever vlog channel all of that stuff so
if you like this video be sure to
subscribe and if you don't I have a lot
of other videos too so you're just gonna
get started though I ask you guys
questions on Instagram so be sure to
follow me on that so the guys don't miss
out Natalie and I have a little bit of
experience with boys I guess you would
say that sounds so weird saying
different situation yeah definitely it's
a good mix so what is your take on
dating someone who has completely
different views than you things like
politicals and religion and for example
I personally think that you should date
someone that aligns with you on those
things because especially politics
morals religion just because those are
such big topics some people get in
fights about and when you raise kids if
you're gonna get married one day like
that's such a big basis of how you live
your life I guess especially like the
morals part of that in terms of like
morals I definitely think you should be
on the same page yeah I agree I when
you're in the beginning stage of dating
you're learning a lot about that person
so like as far as marriage like she was
saying that'd be really hard because
it's like what do you raise your child
you know like what if somebody is this
religion and the other one is this so I
just think personally I would rather
based on my experience like I would
rather date somebody that is more on the
lines of who I am as a person to this
cuz in the beginning it might seem like
it's not a big deal and it might not be
in the beginning but every person you
date you either end up with or you break
up
so you might as well try to date date
someone that you are okay with ending up
with in the future what is your best
suggestion on how to meet guys honestly
girl I have no idea I don't know I the
guys I've dated I've been friends with
for a while so I don't have any like
random encounter though because like if
you're whoever ant like ask that like if
you're in college I feel like there's a
lot of ways like yeah there it's a
certain like friend group but you end up
painting out with if you might end up
liking somebody there or if you go to
things that any kinda like groups are
close yeah I guess like organizations
you could meet somebody there so it just
really depends on what type of person
you are and how outgoing because like
for example I feel like now is a little
bit more shy but yeah I will easily go
up to anybody and just be like hey
what's up you know and I don't oh yeah
and I'm so shy I like I don't know if
you guys know this about me but I just
like I don't go up to guys at a bar I
don't I mean okay also I have a
boyfriend so I don't do that anyways but
even if I didn't have a boyfriend
I wouldn't do that I am NOT the forward
person whenever if someone comes up to
me if I'm out I literally like don't
know what to say I'm just like staring
at them like that's that's not me at all
so data apps - yeah humble and tender
personally I'm single so I would say
they are I guess like a little bit
successful but I mean when you think of
an app it's like oh are the guys going
for one and only thing just be careful
how do you handle a long-distance that
was a question that a lot of people
asked me especially because I have been
dating my boyfriend for - in like two
and a half years I would say and we are
about to go a long distance basically
already started long-distance cuz we
just graduated so I will be in Charlotte
North Carolina and he's gonna be in
Raleigh which is a two three-hour drive
so it's not wearable and right now this
summer we're long-distance cuz I'm in LA
and he's in Europe so we literally get
to talk on the phone for like two hours
a day because of the time change it's
only been like two weeks of being
long-distance so it hasn't been horrible
it sucks like not being able to talk on
the phone all the time but I think once
we're closer it'll be easier it's just
gonna be a lot of like seeing how who's
gonna come over on what weekend like
were you gonna do every other weekend
how busy we're gonna be honestly I
should be asking you guys cuz I really
haven't done
distance yet so let me know any tips for
long distance cuz yeah I don't know so
my past three relationships for oh my
god yes look at trends clean yeah no I
have a trend but I did learn a lot from
them but they haven't really been
successful in my end I feel like it's
like really hard because you go both
they're kind of doing your own thing in
these different cities but yet you're
trying to grow your relationship and my
last one for example was in Florida and
like I would have to fly to him you know
once a month and it was just like it was
nice and when you're with them it's like
the best feeling but then it's like when
you leave it's super sad usually and I
just feel like it's kind of hard because
you have to have like trust is like the
number one thing and I would say
communication is probably just as equal
because you have to like know and
understand like where you both stand as
far as the relationship and how that
distance is factored into that because
my Florida one was my longest whereas my
other ones were like Charlotte to
Raleigh like she's about to do but there
was a lot of other different things and
that's really she gets the reasons I
really don't think it was a long
distance that affected it too much but
what is the best advice you can give
someone who just got out of a long-term
relationship my boyfriend I broke up
after five years feeling a little off so
especially when you've been dating
someone for so long it feels like they
are such a big part of you like you can
it like you texted them every day or you
talked to them every night or you saw
them like X amount of times a week and
they literally know everything about you
like it's really really hard to go from
that to just never talking to them again
I think best advice is honestly time
does heal it doesn't I think time heals
and also understanding why you guys
broke up like in the beginning it's
gonna be really hard and you're gonna
miss them just because you do have to
develop a new routine so like you said
like you're feeling a little off that's
totally normal I think it would be
really weird if you broke up with your
boyfriend after five years and felt
totally fine you know but it's totally
normal to miss them it's totally normal
to feel like you like that's a part of
your life is missing or to be completely
heartbroken like I think that regardless
all the time too like I know I was only
am I for like I don't know five six
months the last one and I don't know
like I mean it killed me I mean you know
one before that killed me and I think it
just regardless like heartbreak is like
one of the most like awful things
it's hard to get through but I just
think with five years - I haven't been
in a relationship that long but Thursday
sometimes you grow apart and I think
that's something if like your is if
that's what you're going through it's
something to kind of just realize that
five years is a lot of change for a
person as you grow and you learn that
you're different people and I think
that's also normal and that's hard to
accept - but sometimes you just have to
face it like but better things and
better things income and my best also
advise us to kind of develop a new
routine focus on yourself a lot what do
you love doing and like literally invest
all your time into that and at first
it's gonna be a distraction and it's
just gonna be a little band-aid to cover
it up but eventually you will start
actually like falling into that routine
and a new normal so this person asked
have you ever thought about breaking up
or were there any moments that made you
think about it and how do you push those
thoughts away my boyfriend currently and
I took a break two years ago three one
and a half years ago I think something
like that it was the fall of my junior
year I believe it was just one of those
things where I was so confused and so
conflicted and there was other things
going on in my life that I just kind of
wanted to figuring out on my own
and so I thought that it would be best
to take a break just to see like what
that feels like I guess I think breaks
can be healthy because you see if you
really miss the person if they're right
for you if you're breaking up with them
and the way that they act after you
break up with them all of these things
that I'm not saying everyone should go
through a break definitely not at all I
don't think most relationships don't
need breaks but if you have that like
desire and you're kind of like feeling
confused and I don't know if you feel
like you have to take that to find
yourself or whatever it is I don't not
recommend it like I think that it could
be healthy you know my boyfriend I got
back together after our break because we
realized that we both really missed each
other it ended up working in our favor
cuz now I kind of don't take things as
for granted I guess as before yeah I
don't know sometimes I think if you're
thinking that it could be healthy - no I
have to take a break nothing can be
perfect better yeah no relationship is
Navy day you wake up and you're in love
with the person like yeah it's not the
reality like you're gonna have days
where you just don't feel like talking
to each other and that's completely fine
I think
so and especially at this age like I
feel like we're so so much change is
going on
that it's so hard to like focus on just
one thing I don't know I just yeah I
took a break with my boyfriend and it
ended up working out for the better so
some people take a break and drift apart
yeah and then you realize that you guys
aren't meant to be together and of that
also what makes a neat Bri on the end to
this is no occasion to talk about it
actually yeah I like I talked about it
to him so if you're having those
thoughts like how can I talk about
education mm-hmm okay how do you learn
to love yourself and get back on the
grind after a breakup that's a good one
Ali I left this question okay well since
mine's more recent I did have a breakup
this past March and even though it was
super rough I mean you can ask Natalie
you could ask any of my other roommates
like I I cried it out for good like two
days I think it's good to like obviously
get your emotion John just but I for a
few yeah isn't it and then just you know
I'm not a journal or but like some
people are like oh Journal your thoughts
and all this stuff sometimes I just have
to kind of like lay in bed and think
through it and whether you know I don't
know I just have to really think about
my passions like I've always wanted to
grow my YouTube channel I've always
wanted to start my own business and
design clothes there's a lot of things
that you just have to kind of narrow
down to like what do you truly want like
ask yourself like what do I want to make
me happy and it goes back to just
focusing on you and you know using it
like she said earlier it was something
like around the fact of like doing your
passion even though it's distracting you
it'll turn into like something that
you're gonna love like for example with
me I am starting my own like sustainable
denim line and go check it out really so
it's gonna be like really simple but I
am working on a right now and I'm
talking about it because it's not really
surprised I want people to know that you
know there is like passions and stuff
after your falling out of love and I
just think it's been really eye-opening
to me and the signs that I've got
overall has just been so crazy because I
was so heartbroken and now I'm just a
happy person like everybody at work is
even like you just seem happier and I'm
just like that is sometimes I
do ya what are your thoughts / advice on
dealing with the societal pressure dive
boyfriend's relationships are even get
married by a certain age I'm 22 and I
haven't had my first kiss yet let alone
a boyfriend it's really hard for me to
put up a front and pretend like I don't
care what others think but deep down
inside I feel super embarrassed by this
I completely understand in the terms of
like you feel old like you haven't done
anything yet I had my first kiss kind of
late for my friend group not late
necessarily for like a society but for
my friend group my first kiss was like
pretty later on in life and I remember
it feeling so like ashamed and when
people would ask me I sometimes would
like lie to them and be like oh yeah I
like kissed a guy when I was 14 years
old literally just a sound cool I don't
know why I did I'm like looking back at
myself and like Natalie you were so
stupid because I thought that people
would make fun of me if I didn't because
I didn't talk to boys I didn't have a
boyfriend in high school for the most
part like it was just I felt very behind
in that and I was always worried like
who's gonna ask me to prom like who's
gonna gonna take to this dance and
stupid stuff like that but like really
it has such a big impact on you if you
go on Facebook half everyone's married
everyone's married and everyone's having
a baby and I'm just like yeah you're
single you're like okay I turn 24 this
year oh yeah don't listen to them yeah I
don't everybody lay their own timing
like everyone is I think that's been
like my problem it's like I'm comparing
myself to like all of my best friends
who have always been in long-term
relationships and are two of my best
friends for my score married so I'm just
like thoughts on dating voice of weed /
substance / drinking problems don't
think of me differently don't judge I
really just think for me personally
knowing my morals you know I'm not like
okay with it like I'm obviously okay
what's going to have a few drinks
somewhere but like I think when it's an
addiction when they get you know when
they drink and they get abusive even or
like you know something
Oh without looking or drinking or yeah I
didn't sort of drug like yeah I think
when there's just a lot of that involved
if you're not that type of person that
generally wants to like deal with it and
you know that it's not right but like
you want to be that with them for other
reasons I think you just need to call it
cut like because it just it's gonna
create problems it is an engine it
really did and I realize like how bad it
was the more I saw them and like oh no
it was just it was really hard and I
honestly was so guilty in their
relationship and I was just like I'm
taking out with them because I know that
will change like I know they're gonna
change I know I like not gonna change
I'm a freshman in college and a guy I
was talking to told me that he's not
ready for a relationship right now but
that he does like me I want to be his
friend but should I move on her wait for
him and how do you go from just being
something to just being friends my take
on this I'm I feel very strongly about
some things like this if a guy is
telling you he doesn't want to be a
relationship or he does not want to be
in a relationship he does not want to be
in a relationship take him for his word
he is not gonna be loyal to you because
he doesn't have to because you guys
aren't dating so just believe him so
many girls are like oh but they'll
change for me like fine like weird we
don't have to be exclusive we don't have
to be in a relationship but we'll still
like your feeling like you're in early
it's kind of hard before the
relationships even my started it's a bad
sign yeah just one of those things where
so many girls try to change guys it's
like stop trying to change them go for
someone that you actually like from the
beginning like basically answers move on
like don't wait for him because no he's
not yeah he's not worth your time he's
just gonna hurt you in the end and he's
his reasoning is gonna be well I told
you I didn't want a relationship
and we did and you tried to change him
and I'm not saying you whoever asked his
question I'm just saying in general so
many girls do that where you just think
that oh he'll be different with me like
he acts super with me he doesn't act
that way with all the other girls listen
to him like please listen to him and
hear him out and don't try to change him
how do you not run back to the same guy
I know that sounds crazy but I'm
separated from my ex and he still
reaches out and it's hard not to fall
back into the same patterns even though
he doesn't want to be with me and he
likes to flirt and have fun without the
relationship so I don't know how do you
fully get over someone and really
separate yourself I guess exes are
trouble so
like big huff think about why you guys
broke up
mmm there was a reason for that and if
you're the type of person that can hang
out and hook up or whatever you're doing
with an ex and not get feelings then
you're one of a kind because I don't
think anyone can do that I I just think
it's so much harder to like move on when
they're still in your life so I would
cut cold turkey with them just be like
you know what we broke up for a reason I
don't want to get back together with you
and it's so hard but it's harder when
you realize that you're falling back for
them and then they either don't want to
be with you anymore like they're like no
like I thought we were just having fun
or you fall back together or get back
together and then the same problems keep
happening I've been in a situation where
we broke up but then we kind of like
kept you know talking and through the
phone and we would hang out sometimes
and like I just look back now and then I
was like oh this is so healthy like
we're gonna be best friends but no all
right I think that is it I feel like
this video is kind of hot minute long
