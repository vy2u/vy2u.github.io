today i'm filming a much-anticipated
video and a video that i have been tell
you guys i've been going to film for so
long and it is my hair care routine so i
am talking to you guys about my hair
because i've gotten so many questions on
it so many people ask me what products I
use what what I do to make it like shiny
and help keep it healthy because I dye
my hair a lot so I actually bleached my
hair obviously I'm not bleach blonde but
because I have such dark natural roots
um I have to bleach my hair to get it as
light as I want it and every time I die
I go a little bit lighter so I put quite
a few damage I I do damage to my hair
but I have maintained it to be really
healthy I used to not really know how to
keep it healthy and it used to literally
be like fried at the bottom but it's
actually so healthy now and it's so
shiny and I a lot of compliments on it
so I decided to show you guys what I do
to my hair and I'm also trying to grow
it out so I'm gonna tell you kind of
tricks that I've learned to grow it out
obviously I don't think my hair is
really that long but it's grown so much
because I just got a haircut maybe like
two months ago and it's already grown
from here to here which is like a lot
for two months like I don't know I just
think that's a lot so i'm going to show
you what I've been doing for that
because i haven't doing something a
little different anyways first thing I'm
going to talk about is obviously the
products I use in the shower because
before the shower I don't really do
anything to my hair right before I get
it I do not wash my hair every day like
I can go in I put my hair in a shower
cap or I'll put my hair up in a bun and
it'll wash my body in like three minutes
and get out of there but I don't wash my
hair every single time because that
strips your hair of natural oils and
that is not good for your hair because
your hair needs oil I know a lot of
people say oh I need to wash my hair all
the time because it gets so greasy it's
getting greasy because you're washing it
so often that your hair is reproducing
oil because it keeps getting stripped of
it so it's like okay Wow like I don't
have any oil I need to produce more oil
and then it over produces and then your
hair gets greasy ur so I would try
spacing
out the time you wash your hair in the
beginning your hair will be greasy just
because it's used to it being washed
every day and it's used to overproducing
so it will be a little grease in the
beginning but then your hair will get
used to it and then it might be as
greasy anymore for a longer period of
time I used to wash my hair every single
day and now I only wash it about
probably like three times a week three
to four times a week wash my hair and
it's not greasy on the off days so it
actually looks a lot better on the off
days and then when I get in the shower I
do the obvious shampoo and condition but
i'll be showing you guys products i will
be using and before i start in this
products i will let you know that they
did send these to me and they did ask me
if I want to do a video on them and I
just told them sure I'll try them out
and if I like them then I'll do video on
them and I ended up loving them and I'm
actually going to repurchase these from
them so don't think that oh my gosh this
is such a sponsored video like I have
before and after pictures like I really
really love these products and I have a
lot of cut not a lot bad doom up
companies come to me and like ask me to
do their video or ask you to like use
their products in my videos and I will
say hey like thank you so much for the
asking me but like I just don't feel
like my viewers would like this product
as much you know and I say no to them so
I don't want you guys to leaving a ton
of comments below being like oh my gosh
she's just did a sponsored video because
no I mean yes I did but like I actually
really really loved these products and
like I mean you guys have been asking me
what I use on my hair and I honest to
goodness like every single time I shower
I use these on my hair every time I wash
my hair I use these so yeah just
disclaimer out there and no I'm not
getting paid to do this by the way it's
not money that I'm getting for my
shampoo I am using my premium organic
shampoo by pura d'Or and it is hair loss
prevention therapy this is what the
bottle looks like it's a really big
bottle so I like it because I go through
these pretty quickly this says it lasts
you three months and the shampoo will
definitely last me three months because
it's like not even halfway over and it's
already been a month so this will
definitely last me three months but like
the conditioner i'm like almost out of
it and it's only been one month so i
think i'm going to need to repurchase
the conditioner before i repurchase the
show
but anyways the shampoo its hair
prevention hair loss prevention therapy
so at first I was kind of hesitant I was
like hair loss prevention but then I
realized okay I'm not balding by any
means but I literally shed it like no
other like I don't know if it's just me
but when I walk into a room my DNA goes
everywhere like literally like my whole
not literally but like half my head is
on the floor like it's I shed like a
ridiculous Malik when I walk in a room
you know I'm there because my hair is
everywhere and you can't touch something
without picking up my hair it it's
disgusting because people are like oh
they like throw it on the floor and it's
like long brown hair and I'm like yep
that's me sorry guys like it so it's
really gross and also in the shower um
after a condition my hair I don't know
about you guys but I literally have a
clump like this big of hair in my hand
that I like curl up into a ball and then
I stick it on the wall and then when I
get out the shower I throw it away I
don't know have that anymore I probably
have a two three strands of hair and
then that just like goes down the drinks
it's like not even enough for me to roll
up and that's it so this actually is
like really really good for that and um
yeah so it's actually sulfate free de
which is good for colored hair like mine
because I don't want my color to be gone
in like two days so because like other
shampoos like strip your hair of
everything like it gets it really clean
but then again it's that whole like
overproducing thing and then it's
shipping it up natural oil which
actually protects your hair which
actually like he's good for it so yeah
i've been using sulfate free products
for a while now and ever since i got my
hair dyed so the thing is though it was
sulfate free products your hair doesn't
it doesn't like foam like you know and
most shampoos like bubble up and film
like sulfate free products don't so you
think like crap like is this even
working but it does I what I do when I
do it I pump a few pumps in my hair I
don't use too much shampoo I rub it in
and then I firstly like put it all over
and as my hair's like in like this I
would clump it all together and put it
all over and then
I like massage my scalp which is
actually good for hair growing I think
that's why my hair has been growing
because I've been massaging my scalp but
I like massage my scalp as i'm doing the
shampoo and not really really gets it
into the scalp um but yeah that's what
i've been using it for shampoo and i
absolutely love it and it is also
organic which i've been trying to use a
lot more like natural products just
because my whole life I've been using
like normal drugstore products which
don't get me wrong they are great too
like I don't have anything against them
but I do notice a big difference when I
use organic products and like natural
products it versus like products with a
lot of chemicals in it and that's what
the shampoo I use and then the
conditioner use is the period or argan
oil premium organic conditioner in
lavender vanilla and my favorite part
about this conditioner is probably the
smell of it like it smells amazing I
love the smell of lavender and I love
the smell of vanilla and when combined
it's like my heavenly scent but yeah it
is it Hans's shine manageability and
control that's what it claims and then I
was like me let's see if that works and
it really does like I would I used my
like drugstore products before like they
made my hair really soft in the
afterwards but it literally felt slimy
like not like oily and greasy but like
it felt like there was like a coat over
my hair of like slime and I just I don't
know that kind of grossed me out so
that's when I started switching to the
more like organic natural products
because like that slimy feeling gross me
out I don't know if you guys have know
the feeling i'm talking about but i
noticed it when i switched because it's
gentle natural and nourishing which I
can agree with on % firsthand like it is
like I don't know my hair just feels
really really soft and I always how i
condition my hair is I just run my
fingers I first put it I like take my
hair to the side and I just go through
it like this at the bottom and I kind of
work my way up and you're not supposed
to put conditioner at the roots so I
don't but I feel pretty far up my hair
does not get greasy like I like it when
my whole head is soft so I probably go
like in a ponytail and then I do it and
then I
my fingers through my hair so it gets a
little bit at the top it doesn't make me
Gracie at all and I'm telling you guys I
oily skin I avoid me everything I have
oily hair I'm greasy hair like and it
really doesn't make my hair grey see so
I'm just like kind of put it everywhere
obviously I don't put a lot at my rights
but i'll put whatever excess on my hands
run it through my hand run it through it
and I don't have my hair doesn't shed at
the end that was like literally I was so
impressed after two days two days of
using it my hair did not shed I was just
like what place that is the conditioner
I use and it's awesome and I love it and
it's actually not animal tested which I
learned from researching then like
before when they were first contact me I
did look a ton of research on them so
they like kind of they are what they I
looked at reviews on Amazon I looked at
everything before I was like okay yeah I
will do a video on it then I apply this
period or argan oil body hair based
treatment pure natural and organic
imported from Morocco that was a
mouthful this is what the bottle looks
like and it has this applicator that i
really like it looks like kind of like a
lab applicator it's easy to use and it
doesn't make a mess everywhere but yeah
so i use this on my hair when it's wet
just because one of my hair is wet it
absorbs it the best so I actually put
like I fill up the applicator like
halfway and then I squeeze it on my hand
wipe it in my hands and then put it at
the bottom of my hair I do not have the
oil at my roots like don't put oil out
your roots guys that will make it greasy
but yeah I put that on my hair and then
it's wet so it absorbs it and then
that's all I do to my hair um I want to
put that any products in it um but
sometimes I'll put a leave-in
conditioner but normally that's
basically all i do cuz minute rush and
oh my gosh out oh my god
sorry guys when it's all dry and when I
that's like style it or when I that's
just like leave it dry I put a little
bit more oil at the ends of my hair
because it makes it just more shiny when
it's dry and I love shiny hair like
that's what I did today I actually
curled my hair today but like that's
what I did today I'll that's all I put
like the oil and shampoo and conditioner
Sophie so that is what I do for my hair
and that's basically all I do tips for
growing out your hair basically my only
things i've been doing differently to
grow it out that i have noticed work is
i've been drinking so much water like i
have a case of water and i have been
chugging those things like I don't even
know how much water I've been drinking
in a day but it's helped my scan to top
my hair as helps literally everything
like drink water you guys I know that's
the oldest trick in the book but like it
really does help and then also the
massaging the scalp I mainly only do it
when I'm shampooing my hair I just like
give myself a little scalp massage but
sometimes I'll just do it here like
after I wash my face or something I just
kind of like I basically just grab my
hair with that and go like this that's
why i do i'll insert a picture when my
hair is curled like at when i got my
hair cut like the day of literally two
months if even it's grown like an inch
or two like it's crazy like my hair is
curled right now and it's like at my
boob like if i press it down it goes up
below my boob but that just has never
happened to me before i'm not
