and today I am putting a healthy snacks
but I also filmed what breakfast one
snack and one juice / smoothie and
they're all for the summer so they're
all really like cool and refreshing this
video is actually a collaboration with
Stefan right and the inner actually
became super close kind of trying to
library and we're probably gonna make a
lot more collaboration later on she's
awesome she deserves way more
subscribers and yeah she's just super
cool and I think we're planning on going
to beautycon out for New York in October
together so I'll be super fine we'll go
ahead like vlogs and stuff but yeah so
definitely subscribe to her because I
think she deserves so many more
followers or subscribers it's her videos
on point you guys they are so good so
yeah just make sure that you're
subscribed to her and yeah check out her
video too and she's like we both put in
some effort into this video so I hope
you guys like it and make sure that you
follow me on Instagram and subscribe to
me obviously thumbs this video up if you
like healthy snacks videos I might do a
school edition line for back-to-school
and also don't forget to join my course
and enter in my giveaway that I have in
like two videos go one or two videos ago
so make sure that you enter in that and
yeah let's get onto the video so at the
very first meal is actually gonna be
breakfast you can obviously eat this any
day but what you're gonna need is some
playing oats some strawberries some
blueberries and a banana or any fruits
that you like obviously so what I'm
starting out with is I am just boiling
some water I'm only gonna make it to
like a slow boil that's what the
instructions say let me know if you guys
have trouble reading like instructions
and like actually following them I don't
know I'm just like a horrible cook so
then I am just cutting up my
strawberries and this is very basic so
I'm just cutting up my fruit and yeah if
I can do these meals you guys can too
cuz I'm like the worst cook in the world
I don't know how I'm gonna like live on
my own in a
apartment next year like that's too much
for me
would I call now they cut all my fruit
I'm gonna see if the water's boiling and
it's basically boiling obviously you
don't want it to be slick to super
boiling I guess then I just pour 1/2 a
cup of oats in and I just let them soak
up all the water until you know it's
soaked and Here I am off-camera time
just kidding I totally knew I was being
filmed funny things you know okay
anyways I was very surprised I caught
all of them in my mouth because I like
rarely happens but after that little
break I saw my oats and they were all
ready so I just put them in my bowl and
then decorated my bowls just with the
fruits that I came up with and I think
it looks so pretty I regret so much not
taking an Instagram picture like that
would have been so cute you guys oh and
I'm stuff from a ball manager am
isn't this so delicious you guys like it
is so beautiful and so pretty and I
seriously love oatmeal like so much and
I didn't even add any sugar it's just
all the sugar from the fruit so this
next meal is not the most aesthetically
pleasing as my other one but basically
what you're gonna start out with is an
apple obviously and then you are going
to have peanut butter
I got almond butter because I thought
that's what I was gonna use but then I
switched it up to peanut butter and then
some pistachios or any nuts that you
like or granola or anything just to kind
of put on top I also didn't mention but
I am going to be using some coconut
flakes but anyways Chloe's cutting my
aqua for me because she looks stronger
than me and she is still struggling you
guys it is hard to cut apples like is
anyone with me on that anyways I'm just
going to take my out of slices and place
them on my plate and yeah just kind of
prepare my little snack this part is so
much harder than it looks but basically
I tried spreading peanut butter on them
which I did but they look really ugly
but I promise you guys they are so so
good they just like look ugly but you
know what just to get past the looks
it's all about what's on the inside that
counts right yeah okay so anyways I'm
just gonna place some pistachios on top
of it I like to call this like little
ants on a boat or something I thought
that's what it looks like I'm really
laying you guys I don't know but yeah
ants on a boat that's what this one can
be called and then I'm going to just
spread some coconut flakes on it and I
love coconut but of course you can put
granola you can put chocolate syrup
whatever but I just top them with a
little bit of sweetness
double-fist in sand apples so this next
thing is actually a drink I think it's
so funny it's a cucumber watermelon
watermelon watermelon agave agave agave
okay sorry you guys that was really
random but anyways this is just a nice
refresher it's just a nice cool drink
so anyways I'm cutting up half of a
cucumber cutting that up into slices you
know letting it roll around on the table
but yeah I love cucumber and I love
watermelon so that's perfect
oh here another off camera screen time
okay anyway back to this cooking show so
we're just gonna pour some watermelon
into that I nutribullet and I love
watermelon if that is like the fruit of
the summer for everyone I think and then
I'm just gonna put some cucumbers fill
it up obviously I'm gonna put more
watermelon and then we're going to
sprinkle some agave on top just to make
it sweet and not to let the cucumber
overpower it and agave is actually
pretty healthy it's a natural sweetener
and it's a lot healthier than honey and
then we're just going to blend and it
looks kind of weird being blended up
like it doesn't look that good but oh my
gosh you guys is so good and it is so
refreshing like I think I'm gonna take
this to the pool with me next I might go
because it is like the most refreshing
thing ever
yeah Here I am just enjoying it and you
guys wanna sit and also definitely make
sure to check out the collaboration
because she's awesome like I said so
yeah let me know what your favorite
snack is and if you tried any of them
out some of them the Apple - Geo peanut
butter one I thought it would be so much
cuter but like it turned like peanut
butter got all messy but it was so good
I think that one was my favorite
and then the oatmeal and in the juice I
would love what I'm gonna bring that so
cool like summer goes it's like so
refreshing cool we hope you guys enjoyed
this video let me know you guys
and make sure you give this video a big
big thumbs up especially if you're
excited for more claps with me instead
and yeah I'll talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
