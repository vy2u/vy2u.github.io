today I am coming to you with a high
school advice video and I am so excited
because if you guys can tell I am in a
totally new background and it is kind of
plain right now I am in the process of
moving apartments I actually already
moved but I am just in the process of
decorating my new apartment so I am
getting a new shams in the back and
they're gonna be light pink so I think
they'll be really pretty and I have no
idea what to do on this wall so if you
guys could leave some ideas down below
that would be awesome because I don't
know what to put and it looks really
plain so yeah it just give me some ideas
my theme is like white and gold and a
little bit of light pink but yeah and a
lot of wood I have it's really cute I
can always give an apartment tour I will
be doing that don't worry but once it's
all decorated and once I am all settled
and that will be coming to you this is a
high school advice video and I know a
lot of you guys have already started
high school or about the start high
school but I just figure this will be
good no matter what stage in high school
you are in and whether you you started
or not because you know you know all
these the first day of school this is
just the things I have learned
throughout high school that I kind of
wish I knew but also just some tips and
advice for you guys the first piece of
advice that I have and tip that I wish I
knew is that your friend groups in high
school will change the people that you
entered high school with most likely of
course there are exceptions most likely
though the people in your friends
freshman year will change by the time
you get to senior year I am not close
friends anyone that I was friends with
in middle school or freshman year of
high school and that is kind of sad but
at the same time both of you guys just
grow apart and I'm not saying that it
needs to change by a big fight because
that's it not happen to me it's just we
just grew apart
we went our separate ways and we
realized we're kind of we belong just
like what friend groups fit us the best
sophomore year I stayed friends with a
lot of people that I was friends with
senior year but yeah your friend groups
in high school will change and they will
evolve and it is okay because that is
just the process of life and honestly
your friends senior year are your best
friends for life so we'll may not for
life
only sophomore in college but they're
your best friends for a while so yeah
senior year isn't really important and
like those friends are great and it's
okay if you drift away from the friends
that you have friends but then you
thought you'd be with your whole life
even it's just okay it happens to
everyone
second tip I have for you guys is that
people will change or people will do
anything to fit in in high school that's
not really a tip it's just kind of
something I've learned and a tip for me
is that don't be one of those people who
do anything to fit in because it's so
not worth it and you guys will enjoy
your high school so much if you try to
just be yourself instead of trying to
fit in there were so many girls that I
was friends with and that just I knew
and they would do anything to be with
the popular kids and unfortunately the
popular kids in high school I have found
at least design high school where the
kids who drank and the kids who smoked
and those are the popular kids I
recommend that you don't need to drink
to have fun and I recommend that you
don't smoke because smoking is bad for
you but anyways if that is your thing I
guess that's like your friend group but
if that's not don't try to be friends
with those people just because you want
to be cool because by Sting new year
again everyone kind of is in the same
friend group look there's no like
popular not popular at least I realized
senior year everyone comes together
please don't do anything that to fit in
because it's so not worth it and you
will have so much more fun being
yourself and being with friends that
actually care about you instead of
friends that all they think about is
who's gonna buy your alcohol where are
we gonna drink next whose house are we
gonna have a party at so much better to
not be like that and to just go with
your friends that actually care about
you you will have such a great high
school if you do that number three kind
of stupid number two
but I realize that people in high school
will do things and you will do things
that you never thought that you would do
and that's kind of sad because I've
heard that quote like would your
seven-year-old self be proud of who you
are today because I think a lot of us
when we were in fifth grade we signed up
for like the dare program and we were
like I vow to never drink and never do
drugs and in high school that changes
and people who said that they would
never do it end up doing it
people a lot of people do and it's
actually very sad but that's what I just
realized that people say that they won't
do something entering high school and
then they'll change and do it by the end
of high school and you're identified but
you stay true to who you are and make
sure that you always have your values in
check that if you guys have certain
values that you want to stick by for
life just like morals make sure that you
always go back to this kind of reassure
yourself or not reassure yourself but
think back and be like okay am I being
who I like am i doing what I'm supposed
to be doing here are my morals lining up
or am I just trying to do this to fit in
make sure that you always check yourself
that is so important to always just make
sure that you have accountability make
sure and I personally would advise maybe
and even an accountability partner
someone who's kind of on the same page
as you and your beliefs and just turn
them hey will you make sure that I'm on
the right track and I'll make sure
you're on the right track obviously
don't be like hey you're wrong you're
doing something that I don't really fun
to do no that is not what that means it
just means like hey maybe we shouldn't
do that because you know we told
ourselves that we wouldn't something
like that but yeah because people will
end up doing things that they never
thought that they would do and that
typically happens to everyone that's
happened to me that's happened to all my
friend but just make sure that you
always have your morals and check and
that you can always go back to those and
you don't stray so far apart that you
don't even know if those were anymore
number four is that it is very hard to
keep secrets in high school I have
learned my high school I'd say would be
like average size I had about 330 people
in my graduating class we had about like
1200 or something in the whole school
something like that 1,300 maybe and
secrets got out people gossip it's
basically like a pastime in high school
to gossip about everyone at your high
school so yeah there are no such thing
as secrets in high school that's just
what I've learned you will tell someone
one thing and then they'll be like okay
promise not to tell anyone but this
person told me this that person goes
promised not to tell anyone but this
person tells me that it's just a chain
reaction and then it just gets blown out
of proportion and yet people don't keep
secrets in high school I didn't really
have drama in high school I
when your drama the like not really and
people still like new everything that I
did everything it was just yet people
know everything about you
number five it's to go to sporting
events that one sounds kind of like
silly like okay why do I need to do that
even if you're not I guess if you really
hate sports you don't have to but
sporting events are so much more than
just the sports it's really just a time
where your whole grade comes together
and you hang out with everyone in your
school in a not school environment like
you're not doing work you're actually
having fun at a sporting event cheering
on your high school and having school
spirit really is cool guys like
seriously even if you don't like your
school have some school spirit just to
like like have some fun because you will
always have fun if you participate but
anyways go to sporting events there's so
much fun like I remember football games
are so much fun even though my football
team is suck blast my senior year it was
still so much fun and like our soccer
team was the bomb and like soccer games
or so oh my god they were so fun
basketball games are fun just like
literally anything lacrosse games they
were all everyone just went and everyone
had so much by going and that was like
my favorite part of the week going to
sporting events so I recommend starting
freshman year just go be involved go to
sporting events go to games like cheer
on your friends share in your school
it's actually a lot fun and those will
be the memories that you will remember
when you graduate high school I promise
you that first six kind of has to do
with number five but it is participate
in spirit week and just spirit school
spirit it is so much fun like I was
saying to participate I remember we had
spirit week two times a year and half
the school would not participate and I
would just be like wow why are you too
cool to dress up for like I'm gonna like
tacky day we've never had that but like
something like that like come on they're
so much fun you my friends would go to
Goodwill and buy all of our outfits and
like I remember thinking that that week
was like the best in my high school I
still remember it to this day and that
was two years ago oh my gosh but it's so
weird that that was two years ago I like
can't wrap my
around it because I remember it so
vividly and like I'm number seven is
kind of like what I was saying a little
bit in the beginning but who you are
freshman year is not who you are going
to be senior year and that is okay
because freshman year you are about 14
years old and senior year you are an
adult you are 18 years old so much
happens in those years and so much
growing like physically spiritually
emotionally everything you just grow
those ears you really find out who you
are as cheesy as that is and you really
find out what you want to be in life
what you want to do in life not
necessarily career-wise but just the
type of person you want to be and that
is so important you change so much and
accepts that who you are fresh from your
is not your gonna be senior year and
that is so great like I like you don't
want to be the same person you were a
freshman your senior year god no like
look at picking me freshman year I don't
want to be that your city k-8 it's
actually try hard but do not believe
that the person you are like in high
school is going to determine how well
you'll do is the real world like it's
not going to determine your success if
you failed couple classes in high school
trying really hard not to do that
obviously if you're failing on purpose
then you need to step up your work ethic
but if you're truly trying your best and
you're not getting the best grades you
don't a 4.0 or whatever that is okay and
how well you do in high school does not
determine how well you're going to do in
college in college or in the real world
and my biggest thing is when people
think that you have to go to college my
high school everyone went to college I
think we had 10 kids not no I think we
had three kids not go to college three
out of 330 my high school was so
competitive oh my gosh and I really did
love my high school because I am
competitive but for some people it's not
a good environment and it's also just
who like college is not the end goal
that should not be your uncle you don't
need to go to college like I think that
a lot of people don't realize that you
don't need to go to college higher
education is not a right it's not a
necessity and you don't need it
succeed and I think it's such an insult
if people think that you need to go to
college to do well because that's so not
true there's so many other fields that
you can go in that don't require college
and what if you have a talent and you
want to pursue that and that doesn't
require college go for it like I think
that you don't need college I obviously
am in college and for what I want to do
I need to go to college but for some
people they don't my best friend
randomly move to California and is
living life there and she didn't go to
college and she's so happy right now
so I really think that it's all about
what you want to do in life and what if
school is for you like some people just
really are not good in school and that's
fine but yeah don't worry like if you
don't get the best grades in high school
don't think that that's gonna determine
your future but I do recommend trying
hard because if you don't try in
anything then you really aren't going to
get that far if you're not trying that's
the thing if you're just sitting on your
computer all day it's hard to believe
that something is going to come and
you're just gonna all of a sudden do
well you actually have to get up and try
but it's okay if you fall short of what
your expectations are if that makes
sense I hope it does number nine is to
stay close with your family your family
will always be there for you and I know
I am always with my friends when I'm
home and I was always with my friends in
high school and my parents would get so
mad at me but really it's so important
to stay close with your family because
they're the ones that are going to be
there for you in 30 years 50 years
however long and they're the ones that
are always so gonna support you like
family always supports you and I just
think that's so important to do family
especially going through the high school
because there's a lot of ups and downs
of high school and sometimes you're
gonna hate it sometimes you're gonna
love it but so if we're going to have
that support system and just to have
your family like tell you like hey it's
gonna be okay don't worry but it's going
to be okay and I think that's a really
great thing and I think parents are
really wise and older siblings are
really wise and they won't
insight that you yourself just don't
like would never have thought of or
would never think and they will reassure
you and I just think it's really
important and number 10 I think I've
said so many times in this video but
senior year will be the best year of
your life
obviously might not be for everyone but
for the most part most people I've
talked to senior year was so much fun if
I could read her senior year 20 million
times I would it was that great for me
it wasn't that I was cool it wasn't that
I was popular it was just that I had
awesome friends and I had an awesome
time and senior year everyone comes
together really we had no friend like by
senior year every single friend group
was friends with each other and like if
there was like a party or something
everyone would go and it'd be like so
much fun it would be like sophomore year
if a friend group was hanging out and
another one can't they be like oh what
the heck are they doing here no senior
year everyone comes together and it is
awesome and great and I really wish I
could relive it because I just miss it
so much I hope those tips helped you or
that advice helped you at all I will be
doing a college version of this
obviously I'm still sophomore I'm a
sophomore in college today section I
forsake class I'm going to class right
