today i'm sewing a holiday gift guide
for you guys and I'm so excited to film
this because I just love the whole like
Christmas holiday season and I have
never made a holiday gift got four and I
know how a bully her and I got a lot of
my ideals it last year I was to get
people from watching YouTube videos
about skips so I'm really excited for
this video and I have something for all
of your personality type literally I
just posted like a time to Denver
personality type and I kind of looked
online at different things and things
that I would like and also my friends
would like and as a feeling this how
they get guys so if you guys like this
video give it a big thumbs up make sure
that you are subscribed so you can see
all my other videos and stuff but yeah
I'm just gonna get right into it and
hope you guys enjoy by the way this
video is not sponsored I know when
youtubers share multiple products or
eight products in their video he will
take sides on Michael a sponsored video
this is not sponsored these are all my
own opinions I have all of these
products like myself no one is paying me
to make this video I just want to throw
that out there before I get comments
like wow like what you don't like this
products whatever I do I have them all
of my house so yeah now let's get
started so the first gift that I piece
after you guys is for somebody who loves
music which I know it's very broad tip
it's like everyone loves music but this
one is for somebody loves music but also
kind of being in the like fashion trends
is so there are these music muffs they
are by nature music mops I got these
online there
turn on QVC nordstrom salsa a bunch of
other places sell them they are super
cool from what you see it just looks
like playing earmuffs while I look
really funny how you like adjusted okay
yes that's a lot better when you see
they're just plain earmuffs and they
keep you really really warm but they are
actually headphones so music muffs here
they are so you can just plug it in like
it's a headphone jack if you live
somewhere where it gets cold which is
most of the country and I feel like a
lot of places get cold in winter then
these aren't awesome for you and if your
girlfriend or friend or whatever loves
music then this is great because she
probably has all this she probably has
all the other headphones that are out
there in the world and yeah these are a
little different I am seeing people
wearing these so that's why this was a
gift god I'm trying to get like
different gifts so it's not like
standard new google facing yeah I would
definitely check this out they breach
really great sound I've used them before
I think they're really cool and walked
into class on it's cold outside it would
be really nice to have headphones and
also if your mouse because let me tell
you I always some music when I walk into
class and I my ears are always freezing
when cool outside so that kind of a best
of both world so I will link all of us
down below where you can get all these
things and
first kid for your music lover a second
gift is for someone who has a big year
ahead of them or just someone who's
doing a lot or just likes to plan so i
have this planter and it's from band do
that's the company i actually got apps
woozi's if I didn't from van do I'm sure
they get these at a lot of places this
is what it looks like I thought it was
super cute because I love gold it's just
very metallic and I like the hard cover
it it's not like flimsy or sufficient
for anything like that is selling price
for this is only twenty dollars so it's
a lot more inexpensive and a lot of the
different planners you can get like an
erin condren or something like that but
that's like upwards of sixty dollars so
if you want a cheaper alternative this
is definitely a good one because it's
still so cute and I like this because
the stickers in the front and I'm so so
cute so you can make them hun scrapbook
if you want each page is like very
colorful here's the start of January so
I thought that was awesome so this is
there someone is a big day or big year
ahead of them and my favorite part about
this is actually how it doesn't have
line so here it does not have in lines
when you're writing out what you need to
do I hate what things have lines just
because I feel very confined oh and I
like writing as big or small and I want
and also you can doodle scrapbook
whatever so I thought this was so cute
and it's such a cheaper alternative in
erin condren i have an erin condren and
i love it but I know lagos don't want to
spend sixty dollars on a gift to just
one person the next gift is for someone
who loves tumblr which is a lot of
people but this is for someone who is
very active on the Lord loves the look
of their tumblr ascetic it's everything
to them and
no it's not a laptop but it is decal for
your laptop so I made this you guys have
seen this in Fulani videos on I i always
get comments on my athlete posted
pictures on Instagram of it I love my
laptop decal I made it myself so this is
what it looks like I'll shove it up
right it's basically a lot of pictures
from my tumblr that I just put together
and you can create your own detail and
just make it helps it like you can make
the pictures as big or small do you want
and you can literally copy of a sound
like wherever it's so easy to adjust but
yet this is stood out for months I have
one before and I just kind of wanted it
more to be like a purple black blue see
now that's why it's so my tumblr it's
basically on my laptop is it so cute it
this is such a personal gift with your
friend who really know that you're in
like thinking about that stuff
especially if you're gonna go through
their tumblr and pick out your favorite
pictures or their favorite picture and
put it on here and of course you can
make it anything you want so I deliver
this website I've been consumed for a
long time lips yeah I really like them
the next thing is for someone who is
starting out at makeup so this one it
may be for your little sister or just a
friend that does really nobody's makeup
but serving out with makeup and kind of
wants to experiment or doesn't have a
lot it doesn't a big collection so mine
is really dirty this is actually a gift
that someone gave me but it is just a
makeup bag that house like an initial on
it or your name or something you get
this monogram in many places that
monogram free sure Suzy's has these two
I don't know where my friend got hurt
this was a gift but yeah I lovelies I
use this makeup
everywhere it's definitely so to travel
makeup bag and then I love something
cute to put just inside just a plain old
makeup bag to kind of put your favorite
items inside the bag for her especially
if she's just starting out and of course
you don't want to shell out like a
hundred dollars so no makeup can be
super expensive so sure that item found
my picks out that might be like a good
idea for us so first thing I picked out
with a Beauty Blender for her because
Beauty water is my saving grace for any
makeup I think any person that starting
out makeup should get a Beauty Blender
it's just so easy to use and it really
like creates a flawless finish to your
makeup second thing or two color tattoos
I just stuck with drugstore products
because of course money purposes and
then you can choose between your
favorite blush bronzer or highlighter I
chose this blush because it's kind of
like a bronzer but I'll glimmer like a
highlighter so it's kind of like at
three in one and then the last thing I
thought in here is a little lipstick so
just a revlon lipstick I thought would
be a good gift to give everyone loves
lipstick now this next gift is for
someone that you are willing to spend
some money on and maybe a really good
friend or a sister or siblings say thank
sisters difference whatever just someone
that it seems a lot to you and they're
also very trendy so these are my babies
they are neat adidas niggers so if any
of you guys know these have been sold
out for months everywhere and I just
ordered I'm doing so happy about it and
like I'm not kidding I was looking for
these shoes since July and they've been
sold out
so if you guys want to defecate your
hands on these like ASAP and give them
as a gift or keep them for yourself
because I love that but these are like
the hottest shoes right now like I have
seen so and you on tumblr or just like
celebrities wearing these in their show
so cute they're only not only their
eighty dollars so they do cost a little
bit but it's not like it's a two hundred
dollars or something like that and like
if you love this is gift for me I think
I would marry you I've been looking for
these for so long you guys like you
don't know so when I found one online i
was so happy so if you find these online
and you know someone that's like super
trendy get into the fashion trends and
like in two tumblers like that I
guarantee you they are looking for these
shoes so this would be like you would
make their you would make their
Christmas the next gift is for someone
who loves kind of Netflix and just cozy
and laws would bombing around and she's
always like wrapped up in a blanket and
stuff like that that this is for that
breath we all have a friend like that
but it is to get a couple of candles
I've got these at target they were very
very cheap I got sugar cookie which
smells bomb vanilla economic which
smells really really good too and snow
buries and this one is a little
different as more of like a spice to it
and more of a strong flavor but I just
really like these and pretty guys but
I'm pretty good some packages for these
and then also to make it a little cuter
i also got a coffee mug this one is from
target as well it says coffee coffee
coffee but all of these style months
they have so many of them and i kinda
wish i got like the one that has a bear
on it as well as a penguin those are
still here with this show me other one I
should gave this gift to my little um
but yes so this is like a such a good
gift it's not like
copy mother just candles it's kind of
telling you're like hey I know how much
you love with lounging around and like
candles and coffee mug like that's like
perfect likes setting for netflix
marathon you know then I skip that and
show you guys is someone who is kind of
walking in their face and trying to
improve in it or just ran the strength
in their face or just getting into it so
this is for someone who is a Christian
or wants to be reached you know just
kind of want maybe even going through
like a tough time in life right now and
if you are listen to break into but I
know Christian so that is why I am
putting them in and if you guys are
anything you can ignore this but this is
something that I think would be such a
great gift and especially for someone
who you know is kind of walking their
baked or two struggling with anything in
their life this would be so needful and
I think this would really touch someone
and yeah I just really like to get to
this it's three gifts of but of course
you could just take a cheese I just
picked three so for somebody was kind of
just starting out and definitely know
what anything about Christian me or
anything like that is I think getting
them a Bible is would be awesome it
shows that you care about them it's just
that you're just willing to kind of help
them out and like it I don't oppress
them and stuff like that but just
getting them a Bible just to show not
with you okay I know you don't have one
so here's what goes or someone who is
already in this has like strong in their
faith and stuff I think that this would
be a great thing for them is a way
devotional i started this devotion with
my friend katie and i'm
and of course I skip a few days
sometimes I have skipped a week and
stuff like that but it's not but it's so
important just to kind of have a
devotional I think this one's really
great it's for anyone who's into season
of waiting so I am in the season
avoiding in college like what they have
am I gonna do with the rest of my life
so this is just good for anyone like
graduating high school yeah just
devotional book is good and I thought
this one was really pretty so this one
just was really really pretty and
actually my friend Katie gave us sweet
in the last one is for someone who just
loves reading books it is called wild
and hollis it's a memoir I freaking love
this book I haven't even had a chance to
finish it but it is amazing at the way
that she rides is awesome it's just four
cents the one who is his grown with is
your whole life but kind of straight
away from it for a while because I think
a lot people can relate to that
including myself so yeah i definitely
recommend this book i would check her
out if you want is by amber C and then
last but not least for this gift guide
is a heated blanket this is for someone
who hates the cold like me I get too
cold I love blankets who doesn't i don't
know but i just really like this one its
from Target it's flat and bread they had
a lot of different colors and a little
different patterns but it's so so soft
it doesn't even feel like I have any
wires in it but it keeps up like it's a
heated blanket like i have been using
this a lot lately and i don't know i
really really like it so for anyone that
hates the cold they are going to
understand why you got this to them and
they are going to love you because isn't
like it anything cause like I don't know
what else to say about it so yeah that
