guys cannot hear me because my volume
for some reason is not working in my
microphone and that's plugged into my
camera so intro is going to be short and
sweet this is my holiday gift guide for
girls another guy one will be coming up
and I wanted to thank adore me for
partnering with me on this video I've
been wearing their stuff since before I
even had a youtube channel and have
worked with them in the past I love
absolutely all their products that may
have such a great deal it's a membership
or you can buy everything individually
the membership just makes it cheaper and
you get twenty dollars for your first
set of bras and underwear but that's not
all they have as you can tell from this
video I chose a variety of things but I
hope that you guys enjoy this video and
all the links will be down below for you
guys to check it out
the first thing I chose was some cute
pajamas this is actually a romper and
I've never seen a romper in pajama form
so i had to get it it has lace in the
center of it so it can be a little cute
and you know flirty but honestly I like
wearing cute pajamas when I sleeping
alone which I do everything all night so
I think this is the perfect gift for any
girl that's kind of girly and like
really cute pajamas so delightful since
with no place to go let it snow let it
snow let's go nothing Joel Stein and
stopping I brought these are some other
pajamas that this is more for any type
of girl or maybe more athletic one they
are sweatpants but still has the girly
effects because you get the silky top
which is so freaking cute and you can
actually wear that as just a regular
cami and set of pajamas but I'm obsessed
with these is Helene I am an idea was
still good by long as you love me so let
it snow let it snow let it soak and with
the holidays coming up that means new
year's resolutions are coming up so
people are going to start working out
more so this is a perfect gift for
anyone that's more athletic or it's
trying to hit the gym some more get them
a really cute pair of workout clothes so
that they're actually motivated to go to
the gym
so what's great about adore me is that
everything comes in sets so I love this
bra let it's a high neck that I wore an
intro actually super super cute and
girly and it comes with matching
underwear so it's just really cute I
don't know I love wearing matching like
bras and underwear is I think I just
feel like my life is together when I
have that I'm stopping I brought I to
turn down let it snow let it snow let it
snow and we finally kiss goodnight wow
it going buddy here are another pair of
brats and then underwear we're all let's
I think are my absolutely favorite I
almost never wear bras anymore because I
just love having my bralette pick
through a shirt or a sweater and love
this color especially for the winter
time and every girl needs the basic
colors
this one is definitely more bold but
hello it's Christmas you can't not get
someone something like red or Santa
Claus ish for christmas i feel like i
don't know maybe that's just me but i
thought this one was perfect for the
holiday season this one is my favorite
just because it's a light pink and i'm
obsessed with this color it's a very in
right now and ask any single girl and no
girl will tell you that she does not
want some cute lacy bra let like that is
just every girls wish list
and if you guys watch my vlogs which if
you don't i'm doing vlogmas so shameless
self promo I basically wear my pink robe
in every single vlog I just lounge
around in that highly recommend getting
a fuzzy robe for your friend your
girlfriend anyone they will literally
wear it every single day I live in the
line and this one is so soft I'm
actually obsessed with it but it's so I
hope that you guys enjoyed my video have
a very happy holiday season and be sure

happy vlogmas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
