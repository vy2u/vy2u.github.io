to me go
what happened to the soul
to be hey everyone is Natalie here and
today i am filming a homecoming inspired
or actually just playing a homecoming
hair makeup and outfits and i'm so
excited on this just because i had sat
down and filmed makeup or film with an
outfit in so long it makes me so sad and
I miss filming so much and I'm on my
fall break so I'm trying to take
advantage of that and take as many
videos as I can hopefully a lot of you
have not had homecoming yet normally it
is in October so hopefully i am putting
it out at the right time if not this
could be for a Sadie Hawkins dance it
could even be for prom it could be for
literally any formal sorority formal
fraternity formal like girls don't
return to normal this isn't a guy
tutorial but you know what I'm saying so
hopefully I can use this for anything
not just homecoming but yeah I think I
like absolutely love this dress it is
some Windsor and I we just know that I
can't talk I decide my hair yesterday so
it is a lot lighter and every single
time I've heard it to the side it just
looks like so much lighter than what I
normally part it's the middle the hair
tutorial is not technically really a
hair tutorial just in I care idea for
foot homecoming and also um my make up
some of it got deleted because I didn't
have enough memory storage and I didn't
realize until afterwards but hopefully
if you guys don't get it and it's not a
lot that got deleted so it should be
fine i think it's just eyeliner but yeah
i hope you guys really like this makeup
tutorial i know i love it and i feel
like a gorgeous in this dress and I like
this makeup and hair and I just haven't
sat down the film so I am suing at home
right now yes i'm actually going to
beautycon new york next week with my
best friend on youtube Steph ran i will
link her down below so check her out so
that you can meet us at beautycon let me
know if you guys are going in the
comments below so yeah let me know and
let's just go started with this video I
don't know why I'm doing this let's just
get started with the video
so today I just started off with a
brightening face primer I used benefits
but you can use any primer then I just
went in with a tinted moisturizer you
can obviously use whatever foundation
tinted moisturizer BB cream you want and
I just blended that in with a beauty
blender I just try not to go for any
time like a cakey look so just the bare
minimum is what i do then i went in with
Maybelline age rewind concealer and I
actually think this is the foundation
but I use it as a concealer because I
just have a lighter color and I put that
on my nose under my eyes a little bit on
my forehead and my chin and then I just
lend it all out with a Beauty Blender
Beauty blenders work magic then I take
concealer and I put it on my pimples and
luckily i only have one today but yeah I
just try to conceal it then I actually
set it with two powders so the first one
I use is a kind of like a tinted powder
then the next one is a translucent
powder this just makes sure that my
makeup stays put because I get super
super oily throughout the day so I just
double up my powders just because I
don't like being oily I think it really
helps me and it still doesn't make me
look at he cuz i'm using the right
products next I go in with my bronzer
and I am not the best at contouring but
I just do the little fishy thing doing
it on the hall as my cheek and then a
little bit of leg up tips of my forehead
top my forehead you know how to do it
not the best contour guys but then I go
in with a highlighter and I just
highlight the Apple or the highs of my
cheekbones and then just right above my
eyebrows it gives it a really pretty
glow and then of course you have to add
some blush NARS orgasm blush is my
favorite it goes well for every patient
every skin tone you name it it's great
next I prime my eyes and I just use mac
paint pot but I just prime them with
whatever primer you guys want seriously
you don't need to use these products I'm
just going to give you an idea next I go
in with some mac eyeshadows but the
naked 3 palette works best for this
because we are using some rose gold
colors I just go in with kind of a
shimmery champagne color on my lid and
then I go in with a kind of mob purple
color on my crease I realized I set the
angle of the camera too high
this makeup look hopefully you guys can
see what I'm doing I just go with a
crease brush you know just do a little
bit of a purplish-pinkish tone in my
crease the point is just to make it a
little bit Matt and a little bit purple
or pink next I'm going in with a dark
brown / purple color and putting it in
the outer V of my crease this is just
going to add some dimension then I go in
with another matte color doesn't matter
what it is in it blend blend blend blend
next I'm going with my eyeshadow or not
eyeshadow eyebrow pencil and I just fill
in my eyebrows the way I normally fill
them in I'm really not that great i like
filling in eyebrows just cuz my eyebrows
are naturally very thick so I honestly
don't really need to but after i'm done
filling in I brush them out twice just
to blend everything up together so
that's just the key that I realized
blend them before blend them after you
know this voiceover is going to be
basically the whole tutorial I kind of
like talking everything out with you
guys next I just add a highlight color
underneath my brow bone that really
makes the barrels top and I forgot our I
deleted the eyeliner footage or the
camera did not film the eyeliner footage
I just landed my eyes I did a wing and
then I did purple eyeliner I hope you
guys can see that and then now I am just
applying mascara do you see how great
this eyeshadow looks though I seriously
love this look I think it just looks
like so much like dimension in it but
yeah and that is it for the I look it
really makes brown eyes pop with the
purple liner in black liner so
definitely recommend this eyeliner look
or this look if you have brown eyes next
I'm just lining my lips with a pink lip
liner and then I'm coloring it in or not
coloring in but applying lipstick just
like a kind of purply color I think
that's great for fall and I always blend
it with my fingers because I always feel
like I put a little bit too much on and
then I apply lip gloss this is a berry
lip gloss color and it also blends the
lipstick out perfectly and that's it for
the makeup look so hope you guys enjoyed
now it is time for hair and this is not
a hair tutorial it is simply just a hair
idea so if you're wearing your hair
straight or curly a good way to add a
lot of volume without any heat or just a
good way to add volume and kind of look
different in pictures and make people
compliment you on your hair is to part
it on the side if you don't normally
part it on the side and if you do pour
it on the side part it in the middle
basically the point is just to switch up
your part and that is my hair tutorial
for you guys so definitely switch it up
and you will get tons of compliments
because you look so different now time
for the best part is the dress my dress
is from windsor store and I absolutely
love it I feel like a Greek goddess in
it it is so so beautiful you guys it has
a gold chain at the top with a little
cutouts at the top to I don't know how
to describe it but you see it it's very
tight but not too tight it's not too
short either so it's not like going
clubbing and my shoes are Chinese
Laundry and they are killer you guys but
yeah so this alpha is just great and
it's from Windsor i will link it down
below seriously love them for homecoming
dresses they are so so so cheap for such
good quality and it looks so expensive
