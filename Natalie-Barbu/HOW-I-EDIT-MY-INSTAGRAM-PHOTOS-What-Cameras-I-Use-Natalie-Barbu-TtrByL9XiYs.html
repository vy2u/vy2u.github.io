welcome back to my channel today I am
filming a how I edit my Instagram photos
video so I feel like people now are way
more into like Instagram themes or just
making your Instagram look a little more
professional or I don't even know if
it's professional is the right word but
just a little more polished so I decided
I would do and how I edit my Instagram
photos and of course obviously kind of
link my Instagram account below so make
sure to follow me if you guys are not
following me already but I am just going
to show you guys the apps that I use how
I edit them and then the cameras I use
or camera that I use studio is also not
to be taken too too seriously Instagram
is however you want to make it you can
post low quality not care about like the
way you edit your photos and still like
that's still totally fine that's you you
know think you'll be a fun video so
don't take it too seriously because
social media should not be taken too
seriously our at least not as seriously
as it has been taken lately but I
thought this was a really fun video and
I can't wait to show you guys so I have
the iPhone 7 plus and I know that you
guys are gonna ask where my case is from
so this case is from Sonics and I think
it's super super cute it's just a palm
trees and like the palm leaves and then
I do have a pop socket on it I got this
at Amazon it's just a plain white one I
actually you did it with sharpie and I
lived through like black lines and gray
lines on it and they're literally all
faded away you can't even see a single
line anymore and I got it last week
so I need to have like a more permanent
marker to draw on it cuz the whole point
of getting white almost so that I could
design it myself but yeah let me know
what markers I should use that will
actually not fade away I absolutely love
the 7 plus I would recommend it to
anyone I know people say that it's huge
and it's like way too big but it really
isn't
I am totally fine with like typing with
one hand it's fine the pop socket
honestly I have it because I like
playing with it it doesn't even really
do much for me but I really like playing
with it and now I'm just going to get
into my phone and we can start seeing
how I edit my Instagram so if this is
what my Instagram looks like right now
it's not really like a set theme or
anything like that I remember when I was
in Europe I kind of tried to have a
theme going on so it looked a lot nicer
like very like bright colors and blues
and so I still try to keep that but I
really like the way it looks I'm happy
with it but what I really like about it
is that it kind of shows a really cool
part of my life obviously it doesn't
show everything because I'm not gonna
post like my bad days or my ugly days
there anything like that but it does
show like my summer and just I like
having it kind of be like a scrapbook
but on the Internet I don't know I
that's what I personally use it for and
what I like about it and of course I use
it to communicate with you guys I'm not
gonna lie and say I don't care about
Instagram or like who follows me or
whatever because I do like it when I get
to talk to you guys and you guys comment
on my stuff so if you guys are watching
this video make sure to comment on my
last video saying that you came from
here I would love that I will comment
back and I will stalk you guys because I
love doing that believe it or not I do
that way off and then you think but now
I'm going to go straight into the apt so
I have a photography folder and so mine
has snapchat is in it because like you
take pictures but it's obviously not
photography so I have a lot of different
apps that I use I mainly just use for
and for sounds like a ton and it kind of
is honestly not even a lie it's a ton
but I first use Lightroom that's the app
that I use to edit all of my photos I
think it's just way better of an app
than visco or anything like that it lets
you
it's like smaller increments so and not
everything is so extreme I feel like
visco everything is really really
extreme with it so I like that this one
isn't like that so here I just have all
my photos I literally edit a million
pictures like I just edit them even if I
don't post them I just like editing
photos and having options um so I'm
gonna open up a random photo this
picture I actually just posted on
Instagram so be sure to comment on that
one today once you walk to this video I
try to get my pictures more in like when
with a shadow I don't like direct
sunlight I tried to have more bright
background so I don't take that many
photos at nighttime so I try to get it
like in the background there was a white
wall and like the white floor but I also
like pops of color so I would blue
outfit on and the green like bushes
around me so I really really like that
like that fit my I guess theme you might
say because it's bright and has like
nothing pops of color in there but I
don't specifically like drive 30 minutes
something like this it's just kind of
convenient and so how I start editing it
is I always go to the light setting
first and I'll just expose it put the
exposure a little higher I get I like
bright bright photos but I feel like
exposure can wash it out a lot so then
I'll put the contrast higher I always do
that and then I'll go to highlights I'll
make the highlights brighter shadows I
make them darker because again I like my
pictures to have a contrast I know some
people don't and then I'll make the
whites bright higher because again I
like my pictures to be bright and then
the blacks lower so it kind of just
stick to that basically every time I
play around with the intensity of it but
that's basically what I do at this
picture I think I'll lower the exposure
a little bit and then with the color I
always drag it down just a tiny tiny bit
because I like my pictures to be a
little more blue toned and then I will
put the pink up a little bit more
because again I like the blue pink tones
rather than the green and yellow ones
and then I've turned the vibrance off a
lot because the vibrance it just like
makes it pop more but it doesn't make
you look orange so I turn the vibrance
up and then the saturation I always put
a little higher just so that my skin
because I did the overexposure I don't
want me to look like a ghost and the
saturation makes me look a little more
tan so I just gently knock that up and
then I put the clarity higher on this
one because I like my pictures just be a
little more crisp and have more detail
in them to make them look better quality
and then for the crop I always try to
straighten them so I will use this tool
to straighten it and I line up the floor
with the lines on the grid and that's
basically how I get like a straight
photo because whoever's taken it might
be taking the little crooked and that is
all I do in Lightroom so it takes me
literally two seconds to do it in
Lightroom I just messing around with it
but it doesn't take me along oh and then
from there I actually go to face tune so
I use a lot of apps it gets kind of
crazy but I used a lot of apps then I'll
go to face tune and that's still there
from before but I'll open up the new one
so I'll open this one up and then I will
white in the background if I feel like
it sometimes I don't white in the
background just depends on if I really
want it to be like super bright look but
if it makes it look fake like if it
literally is super super super white and
I don't really do that but for this I
just
to be a little brighter so I will whiten
my house in the background I'll do like
the window and everything and I really
like face who makes it super easy to be
messy with it because it doesn't really
show like if I get it a little bit on my
skin I feel like it doesn't even white
in it and then I'll bite in the floor to
make it brighter I always do that just
make sure it makes the picture look a
lot a lot brighter it makes the person
which is me in the photo be more of the
center of attentions what I also like to
do is I like detailing things that like
my outfit so I'll zoom out onto my shirt
and then it'll hit the detail tool and
all detail my shirt and I'll detail like
the rips in my jeans and that just makes
my outfit pop more because that was the
whole purpose of this photo was to show
you guys my outfit so that is what I use
that for and I literally don't use face
tune on my face at all
but sometimes actually I use a student
as kind of like a Photoshop so I will
Photoshop sometimes like the window out
of the background and I use the patch
tool to do that
and one time I photoshopped like a giant
trash can out of the photo and it looked
so good I fit Photoshop like things on
the floor I'll Photoshop girl face you
know out this window one time I did that
on one of the other photos it's just a
really really great tool so I'll take it
I'll take like a white part of the wall
and I'll just put it right there where I
want it to go I want it to match this
area or something so I'll just patch
that right there and again you get the
whole point but like I can't continually
put it sometimes it does take a lot a
lot a lot of time but it makes the photo
looks so much better so that is what I
use the patch tool for and I swear like
it works so so well then I go to visco
and we'll apply a filter on it sometimes
sometimes I don't apply filter but
sometimes I do and I know some of you
guys watching this are probably like
this is insane for an Instagram photo
literally takes weeks to three minutes
if I'm not explaining it step-by-step it
doesn't take me long at all
and so then I'll upload my photo and I
will you I always use s2 and I literally
knock it down to like a 1 most of the
time sometimes I'll leave it if it's
like a landscape picture or something
like that but normally if it's a picture
of me I'll just like knock it down
really really lightly and then I'll just
save it and I don't know
the editing on facetune besides the
filter and I always use s2 I don't even
look at the other ones just because that
one's the one that makes it brighter and
makes it look a little nicer and then I
go to plan Olli which if you guys don't
know about this app it's awesome it's an
app that lets you play in your Instagram
feed so I have this all planned out so I
have my Instagram all planned out so
then I can drag and drop my photos and I
can rearrange them or just to see how it
looks because I do want it to look very
uniformed and kind of all go together
so that is what I use plan only for and
you can upload it straight from plan
only and you can schedule it so you can
remind you when you want to post I
mainly just do it to look at my photos
and imports directly from Instagram so I
think that's what a nice part is you
don't have to manually import everything
yourself just the ones that you want so
like if you got it right now your whole
Instagram would still be there right now
you wouldn't have to upload it yourself
but that is basically all I do for the
apps I know that sounded like a lot but
I swear it's really really not that bad
and it takes five minutes of my time and
as for what I take my photos with I
always use my iPhone mainly um I feel
like the iPhone 7 especially the seven
plus is amazing for photos but sometimes
I as like portrait mode and stuff but I
really never use that and then other
times I will use my Canon DSLR 70d that
is the camera that I film with that is
the camera I'm using right now and in
Europe all my pictures with a Canon 70d
so sometimes I'll use that and I'll just
import them but most of the time I don't
have it with me so I'll just use my
iPhone and it works perfectly fine so
it's not a big deal but that is
basically it for how I edit my Instagram
photos this video was super like I
really got to the point I talked to you
guys about what it was I suppose my
secrets to you guys and now you know how
I get the pictures that I get and I hope
that you guys like them and follow me on
Instagram and everything you like that
but please let me know if you like this
video let me know other videos that you
guys want me to do um I love making
videos for you guys and like coming up
with things that you guys want me to
film so make sure that you tell me in
the comments comment on my latest
Instagram if you came from this video
