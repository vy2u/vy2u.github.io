I am selling my skincare routine so this
is really really requested because if
you guys are new here and haven't seen
my everyday fall makeup tutorial I had
pretty bad acne I know it's not as bad
as some people but it definitely was bad
especially for me because I was not used
to having acne in the past few years I
had really really bad acne in high
school and I got over that hump and now
I had it again which was really
discouraging because I am almost 21 so
having acne in your 20s is not really
fun I know I'm in the early stages of my
20s I might as well still be a teenager
but still I thought I was just like oh I
would have that when I was going through
puberty or something so I am here to
tell you guys my skincare routine what
cleared my acting I still definitely
have acne scars but those are going away
my skin for the most part is totally
clear and I'm finally comfortable going
on camera without makeup on like I am
right now by the way I have no makeup on
my face
I have mascara on and I have lip gloss
on and I have eyebrows like Silvan but I
have no makeup on my face at all I just
moisturize my skin and I sprayed the
rose water spray but yeah no makeup so
this is me completely makeup free that's
why I wanted to show you guys how I
cleared up my skin I'm not going to lie
although I still do get the occasional
pimple and breakouts like my last
everyday makeup routine I did have a
couple pimples that's normal especially
because I was on my period then so still
during those times my acne will get like
flare up again but it never got has gone
back to like what it was which I'm so
thankful for I'm just going to first
start off with my morning skincare
routine and then my nice kinky Regine I
only change one thing so it's like not
different really and then I'm going to
talk about products that I used
throughout the week and then I'm also
going to talk about some tips that I
have just to keep your skin clear or I
get started on this video I also want to
say that none of this is sponsored
absolutely nothing I have spent so much
money trying to find products that works
for me so now this is just what I found
that works for me none of these products
were sent to me by the way because I
know that some people might think like
that because I'm using a lot of the same
brand that it might be softer it's not I
totally found this on my own I have been
using the acne
org line and it's literally a free org
if you guys want to find the line if
they recommend that they do so I have
been following that pretty pretty
strictly and I have got to say that that
I think is what really really changed my
skin first thing that I use is the
cleanser so this is just one of the pump
cleansers and then you lather on your
skin and it says not to lather it for
more than 10 seconds which I like
because I like getting my stuff done
really quickly so it's lathering on my
skin for like seven seconds and then I
wash it off with just warm water and
then after that I pad it dry and I wait
for my skin to dry completely after I
use the cleanser so I make I go around
went do other things for like five
minutes or whatever brush my teeth in
the meantime and then I have used their
acne org treatment so this has been well
peroxide so benzoyl peroxide actually is
very helpful for me in high school I
used to use the benzoyl peroxide clean
and clear like 10% face wash and that
works really really well for me so yeah
benzoyl peroxide is definitely a product
that I have found works for me but some
people it doesn't work fix alcohol
gasses doesn't really work for me
doesn't really do much it just dries out
my skin so yeah this really really does
work and I put this on and I leave it on
so after my skin is dry I just leave
that on and it's just like a like a gel
that you just leave on your skin and it
dries and I wear it like my makeup over
it's a sex my makeup or anything so I
then I wait for this to dry and then in
the morning I go in with this clean axe
it's like this French moisturizer that I
got for my dermatologist umm
aping I don't know what it is it's like
all in French but it is for oily blemish
prone skin this is my favorite
moisturizer ever is so so so good I
absolutely love it in the morning I love
the way it smells I think it just is so
absorbent and it's so it makes your face
feel so soft but not oily at all and
like HSI I don't I have no words but I
have only good things to say about this
it doesn't exaggerate out at all
especially because it is made for oily
and acne prone skin my dermatologist
recommended it to me also and it's like
just feel this good morning moisturizer
so yeah I absolutely love this so that
is kind of where I break the regimen a
little bit because I see not works says
to use their moisturizer morning and
night but I just love this one too
I can't let it go so I use that one in
the morning and I think it's great for
underneath makeup it's like it just is
amazing I highly highly highly highly
recommend men's I do think it's a little
more expensive but I think you have to
get it at your pharmacy I'm pretty sure
you have to but yeah I got it for my
dermatologist so I will have it linked
down below though so that you guys can
check it out because it is my by far
favorite moisturizer and also I wanted
to say moisturizer when you are going
through acne is so important I feel like
people don't think it is because
especially if you have oily skin which I
hate the playa oily skin but in the
winter my skin gets dry so typically I
have oily skin though but when you have
acne and less then you have oily skin a
lot of the things that they should one
should eyes because they already have
oily skin and they're using all these
harsh products on that face to get rid
of your acne the thing is your skin is
going to think that it needs oil when
you're taking away all the oil your skin
needs natural oils so if you are
constantly stripping your skin down and
not putting the moisture back into it it
is going to reproduce so much more and
then you're just going to break out more
so do not be afraid of like not oil free
stuff I don't ever pay attention if it's
oil free or not because for me it
doesn't really matter anymore as long as
I'm taking care of my skin in my
skincare regime and I'm not putting like
straight-up oil on my face it really
does not like it's actually better for
your skin this has been I looked on so
many websites find dermatologists have
told me that so you do not be afraid of
things that don't say not oil free or
oil free or whatever don't be afraid of
things that are not oil free because
trusting your skin needs natural oils
that is not always causing your acne
honestly you're asking you might be
caused by you stripping it so much of
oil at night what I do is I use their
acne or moisturizers so this is a yellow
moisturizer so it looks kind of gross
but it doesn't smell bad
it just looks gross because it says that
it has
0.1% like go choke on an ultra calming
licorice root extract which is this it's
yellow color so I love these
moisturizers and I love their acting
contour products because it's not just
over-the-counter like Sen hell peroxide
southfork acid those products like I
know their treatment is menthol peroxide
but like everything else has natural
ingredients it also has a mixture of
ingredients so it's not too harsh I
highly highly recommend them they have
so many before-and-after pictures on
their website so you guys should
definitely check it out a few guys are
suffering through any acne at all but
yeah I highly recommend them I thought
they were great ads for make it remember
life I think these are also crucial one
thing I hate is the Neutrogena makeup
remover wipes those just did not work
for me at all
they made me break out they maybe my
skin feel really split oily and greasy
even though it's oil free it just made
it like feel growth I just hated the
Neutrogena makeup remover wipes which is
what everyone uses like all my friends
use them I've seen so many youtubers use
them but I personally just do not like
them at all so when I have been using I
normally use good Garnier the green
makeup remover wipes which those are the
best I think I'm going to go back to
them because I go out days the ones that
I'm using just because those ran out
like they weren't at the store anymore
but those are my favorite but these have
been working really really well too so
I've been using the simple sensitive
clean experts cleansing facial wipes
these are kinds of skin I make sure to
get things that say time to skin just
because acne skin is sensitive skin like
if you have acne you have sensitive skin
even if you can do harsh product but you
still have sensitive skin so for makeup
remover wipes I don't want to put extra
things I don't need to put on my face so
I always try to use like the sensitive
ones the ones that are calling stuff
like that so that is why I picked these
up and I really really liked them and
the next thing I've used this is not
what I use every single day but I've
used this every now and then is the mask
of Magnum NT from lush I love this mask
I only have good things to say about the
mask it makes my skin look and feel 100
times better after I take it off it
smells amazing it smells so minty it
exfoliates because I don't really
exfoliate that often so this is great
for exfoliating but yeah it is just like
this green mask that I want to put every
single day I normally do this once or
twice a week I try to get twice a week
just because I love it so much but
sometimes like just get lazy and I do it
once a week
that is my go-to mask I'm definitely by
with a bigger size and I can I purchase
it
really really love lush products because
again they are natural they're not harsh
to your skin and I just like how they
don't have that many ingredients and
then because I feel like the more and
more chemicals that you ask your skin
just some more confuse your skin is
going to get everything I'm saying right
now is not I'm not a dermatologist I
don't know if I'm right I just feel that
way because there's so many things that
I've tried for my skin I found that the
more harsh and the more chemicals I put
on my skin the worse my skin has gotten
so that's why I really like natural
products and things that are kind to
your skin another thing that I have used
from lush that I really like that I'm
going to repurchase is the tea tree
toner I don't have it with me but it's
really really good and I'm about to
repurchase it so I will use that at
night after I wash my face like even
when it's still wet I'll just like spray
the teacher toner all over my face tea
tree is a great anti-inflammatory and
it's really good for acne and just
preventing them preventing acne flat
very soft treatment I also have just
like straight left tea tree oil that I
like put a q-tip in and put that on my
pimples because it's an
anti-inflammatory it will shoot them
overnight so that's great
so one thing also that I'm going to talk
about that would not be a skincare
routine and how I cleared up my a/c
video if I did not talk about this I
honestly think the number one thing that
helped me clear up my acne though is
birth control and I am not advocating
for you guys to go on birth control you
need to talk to your parents especially
if you're under 18 talk to your parents
if you think it's a good decision talk
to your doctor and talk to your
dermatologist do not just listen to me
on this that's why I was like hesitant
to put this in it but I have to because
it literally is what cleared up my skin
in high school I went on birth control
because of my athlete my dermatologist
recommended it we tried a lot of pills
we tried a lot of top bushing myths and
nothing would make my acne go away then
I started on birth control so I use try
sprint AK I think I'm not going to
present sure what it is I think it's
judgment pack or try cycling I will link
it down below or like put the name of it
down below after I started using birth
control my acne cleared off almost 100%
which just proved that my acne was
hormonal so I have hormonal acne but I
do think that all of these skincare
products really contribute to it because
I can use products like I use a new
makeup forever foundation I was using
for a while the second I stopped using
it I stopped breaking out also so I do
think
products help me a lot because I have
very sensitive skin so very like a lot
of things will make me break out but I
do have hormonal acne so that is leopard
control saved my skin
this past summer they love me and while
we're talking about it and we were
saying how we were on or how I was on it
for a really long time I was on it for
about five years or something like that
and so my mom decided to maybe wean off
of it or did not wean off of it but just
to stop it and see how my skin reacted
if I still needed it and then I couldn't
breaking out like crazy again so then I
went for a whole summer about birth
control which was fine but I started
breaking out and so I went back on it
after I talked to my dermatologist and I
talked to my doctor at school and I went
back on it and my skin cleared up again
so it is hormonal acne for sure and
again I am not advocating for everyone
to go on birth control this is just what
works for me definitely talk to your
parents about it and talk to your mom
talk to your dermatologist
talk to your doctor like trust me do not
just listen to me on this but yeah I
have not had any negative side effects
to birth control I have not gained
weight I think maybe when I was 16 and I
went on it I was like maybe gained a
little weight but I was literally a twig
like freshman year so maybe the way cane
just like filled me out or maybe was
just puberty I don't really know but
yeah I did not experience any weight
gain with it I did not experience any
mood swings in the beginning I may have
had a few mood swings like looking back
on it but I'm not under % shirt nothing
that was very noticeable to me I
experienced I didn't really have any of
the negative side effects I was never
nauseous I don't know if that's for side
effects but I was never nauseous
I felt fine like my energy was so up so
yeah I did not have any negative side
effects to it and to this day I don't
have a negative side effects to it I
really really really enjoy being on it
because it clears out my skin the next
thing that I also wanted to say was that
I exercise more frequently I also notice
in the summer in the beginning of the
school year I didn't exercise as much
and that was when my acne was really bad
and then the second I started exercising
after like a week my skin hit cleared up
again so this is all like so many things
that I have tried and I have noted the
powder okay I stopped using that and
then my skin got like this and then I
started doing this
like this so I tried a lot of different
things just to kind of see what works
and what didn't and I kind of tried them
all individually so none of them were
crossed so I didn't know which was
attributing to what
so again when I started exercising again
my skin did clear up significantly and I
think exercise really makes your skin
clear so I have an exercise routine if
you guys want me to make a video on that
let me know but yes that really really
cleared out my skin also drinking more
water
absolutely bad at drinking water but
when I do drink more water I do notice
that my skin gets like more it was glows
more doesn't man just get clear just
like glows so drinking a lot of water is
good just I'd recommend just having a
water bottle that's refillable that you
can always constantly refill because
having plastic water bottles just makes
you not drink water as you like um yeah
so that use like a kerosene this video
is so long so I hope that you guys like
it those are my tips also I do the
typical like I clean my towels I use
different towels like for my body and my
hair that I use for my face which I have
face towels by my sink that I only use
for my face I don't like wash my hands
with them or like dry off myself after
the shower I strictly use those for my
face I think that helps I try to wash my
Beauty Blender but I'm really not that
great at that but I hope you guys going
to enjoy my skincare routine all the
products will be linked down below and
if you guys want to find out what makeup
I use and doesn't breaking out I will
put my everyday makeup tutorial down
below because I just from was last week
so I'm not going to talk about that
right now but I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and if you're new to my
channel please subscribe if you guys
