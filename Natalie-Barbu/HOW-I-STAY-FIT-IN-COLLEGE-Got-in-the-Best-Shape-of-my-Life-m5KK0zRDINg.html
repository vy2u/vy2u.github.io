I am coming to you guys with a fitness
video so I really wanted to do kind of a
how I got fit in college
/ how I stay fit and how I got basically
in the best shape of my life not even in
college just like I've never been it's
healthy I've ever been this in shape I'm
really happy with the way I feel the way
I look but I know workout routines are
super popular and I was debating doing
one of those but I don't really have
like a set workout routine that I came
up with I actually follow something else
so I thought it'd be better if I just
did a sit down video and I just talked
to you guys and I just told you guys
what I did instead of showing you
because every day it's different and I'm
not the one that comes up with it and
I'm not a personal trainer which is why
I go to these things that I use because
they are actually like approved of being
able to tell me what to do when I work
out in a safe way and make sure I'm safe
and yeah so I don't want to get into
anything like to show you guys or tell
you guys what to do because I am NOT a
personal trainer nor am i anywhere near
like specialized in that like that's not
even my major or anything like that so
yes I just want to be better to do a
sit-down talking video before I get into
the video though if you guys are new
here and slippers I'm seeing my face hi
I would love for you guys to subscribe
to my channel we have a pretty awesome
family here so I love for you guys to
join help out feel free to follow me on
all my social medias I've been getting
way more into Twitter and snapchat and
Instagram has always been my favorite
but yeah follow me down below everything
you need down there but without further
ado let's just get into how I became
sick first I'm going to give you a
backstory so in high school I did not
play for us I'm was one of the only
people ever that did not play sports I
don't know why I just don't I'm not
athletic at all like oh no senses
athleticism in me at all so yeah I never
played sports so I was never like at
practice working out or anything like
that
and even in high school I didn't really
work out that much I was never like big
at all though I was always very very
very skinny so I was always like
underweight or just very skinny like
just naturally that is how I was didn't
have any muscle I was a tone or anything
I was just kind of like a stick I didn't
curb my butt was like this my chest was
like this it was just like a bored so
that was me in a high school and I
didn't really work out ever
sometimes like senior and junior year I
works out like I did not have a routine
I would go weeks without working out so
yeah that was me in high school
freshman year I kinda want to started
started working out but I did like I
wasn't really consistent or anything
like that and then sophomore year in the
beginning I was like never working out
and then second semester sophomore year
so you know what I need to get myself
together and I need to start working out
because as college came on I didn't gain
the freshman 15 or anything like that
but I was starting to lose like my just
like flatness I guess and I was kind of
developing small curves and then they
weren't being toned so like everything
in that also I realized went to my
stomach I just still have a small butt
and everything like that but I just went
to my stomach
and it was not big at all but I was not
happy with how I felt and I just always
felt tired and fell just kind of gross
and I don't know I I was not taking care
of myself at all I wasn't necessarily
unhealthy or like oh recent anyway and I
still probably like in the healthy range
because I still tried to eat kind of
healthy but I wasn't working out I
wasn't like doing anything mindful you
know what I'm saying so I was just kind
of like a normal person just going
through life like not really caring what
I put in my body and ever what I even
did with it so yeah that is kind of like
my backstory I feel like a water you
guys can relate because it's very very
typical for college students to like not
be like unhealthy but also not be the
healthiest not care and I started
working out and I got in really really
great shape and I had been on that track
ever since so I'm actually going to tell
you guys how I started and this actually
all started with a New Year's resolution
so you know what guys this works in fun
now I'm going to break it up to you guys
throughout the past year that I have
been actually focused on being healthy
and being fit and saying in college
because I know that is hard the first
one is that you have to be disciplined I
know this sounds kind of scary like what
do I need to be disciplined
but for me the biggest thing is actually
getting myself to work out 95% of the
time I don't work out and I'm sure you
guys can relate it's all in your head
you just don't want to you're just lazy
whatever it's not like like your body
physically can't it's because you don't
want to so you just have to be
disciplined what I do is I stick to a
schedule I know I don't have class in
this period of time so I am going to
work out then even if that means waking
up early I am going to I kind of just
like engraved it in my mind that I have
to like it's kind of like a class for me
now which is what I basically do for a
lot of things I do that for YouTube
videos too so that is my way of doing it
I absolutely have to work out like
there's no moving that out of my
schedule I have to workout in the
morning I am a morning person if I don't
work out before my class I won't work
out the rest of the day I know it
because it's in my head like I said and
I just been lazy and I don't want to
afterwards it's so nice to start your
day feeling like you actually already
did something like you before you even
start you may actually already worked
out and you feel amazing so I would
highly recommend it and especially as
the day goes on you get tired you
realize you might have stuff to do and
also it's just I don't know I just can't
work out at night I just feel like I'm
so exhausted from the day and I also
feel kind of gross from like eating
everything throughout the day and like I
don't know when to plan dinner I'm going
to work out at night so yeah I just
stick to the morning it's really easy
for me to you have to stick to a plan
you can't just say I'm going to try to
work out this week I would definitely
have a plan I'm going to work out five
days of the week how much that number
have a set plan another thing is to have
a goal so when I first started working
out Michael is end of it to is to have a
toned stomach have toned leg work on my
booty and kind of lift it up and also
have found arms basically I wanted to be
toned I didn't want to lose weight if
that is your goal that is amazing have
that as your goal for me my goal is not
to lose weight because it didn't really
need to I just wanted to tighten
everything up and be tone have a goal if
you don't have a goal and you're just
working out just because you think that
it's good for you that's great and it's
not it's also not bad but you're not
going to be motivated so I would
definitely have an end goal in mind also
take pictures so that you can see
results pictures are my favorite so yeah
it's definitely
that is definitely my first huge tip
that I think if you have this you will
be set for life the next one that I want
to share is you guys is some apps that I
love the first one that I have been
using is the Nike training app it's 100%
free and it has like intense workout
guides for you so I am doing a six-week
lean fit workout plan
it's adjust you how hard you've been
doing what you've been doing it's just
like the most amazing I've ever hiked
and they have good things to say about
it I highly recommend it it's every
workout is made by like a trained
professional either an athlete or a
trainer and it's just amazing it
actually works you out I was so sore the
next day it's not one of those apps that
like says it's going to work you out but
really it's like super easy stuff no
this stuff is good and it also lets you
choose like how much equipment do you
have do you have no equipment where do
you want to work out what's your weight
what how many times a week do you want
to work out what is your goal it asks
you that because it's so important
because I advise are my favorite app and
a hundred percent free so I don't know
why anyone wouldn't use it but yeah I
highly recommend that all everything I
say will be in the downbar below but
like if you guys don't pick anything on
this video like get that app and it will
get you into shape the next thing is
that when I started working out I
actually started with the Caleb programs
the kale programs are extremely
expensive
they're like 70 bucks or something like
that for 12 weeks so ridiculously
expensive so I totally understand as a
college student cannot buy that but it
really really did work that is the one
thing I think that whipped me into shape
from nothing in shape to getting into
shape and after that I did the Nike
saying once I was already kind of in
shape so recommend the Nike one but the
kayla one I'm telling you you see before
it after transformations in three weeks
I was so shocked by my transformation in
three week I don't know what it is it's
very simple moves that she does it's
nothing crazy but it really really works
so I have a proof of it it works so well
you guys other thing is you have to be
disciplined because it is five times a
week so you can't really skip any you
have to skip days
but yeah five times a week and it's
pretty intense but like doable is only
thirty minutes and then the next thing
I'm going to talk about is what I do at
the jam so besides doing my Nike
training app or the Kaila one depending
on which one I'm doing right now I'm
doing Nike training I might go back to
Caleb oh but I'm not sure as of now I'm
really happy with the Nike training app
but after I do whatever the set workout
of the day is which is typically between
thirty and forty five minutes I always
do as our abs or butt or both and I just
actually look up a YouTube video I like
Blogilates so I always look up
Blogilates and Blogilates and butt and
sometimes depending on how much time I
have I will try to do a quick one or I
might do like a ten-minute one but yeah
my abs in my butt or something that I
like targeting individually so if you
guys have a set target on your body that
you want to target individually after
you workout I would recommend doing a
quick five-minute video every single day
it's super quick and super easy and it
doesn't feel like you might be working
out that hard but if you do it every
single day I am Telling that you will
see results after like a week of just
doing ABS I can tell the difference
after a week of doing just my glutes you
can tell a huge difference you guys so I
would highly recommend if you guys have
any target points to work on that I also
sometimes run but the Nike Training app
and Kaila also allows you to have days
where you can just run and or do any
cardio so on those days I'll either go
on the elliptical overall run outside if
it's not cold and then I also do yoga
sometimes I personally like doing hot
yoga but I also have an app on my phone
called yoga studio that's one of the
apps that I also like I forgot to
mention but that one is great - I really
like yoga just because it makes me
stretch it makes me feel more flexible I
think it's really really good for you to
make sure that you're stretching your
muscles and also yoga makes you really
strong you are holding those poses for
like a minute and you are sweating
especially hot yoga but yeah I really
like doing yoga on my off days also
where sometimes I'm like substitute what
I workout so I have to do for yoga class
because I don't know I just I don't like
being confined into doing just one thing
so it's definitely flexible after eating
like I said I don't dye it but I do eat
everything in moderation so I'm not
going to order 2,000 calorie meal and
eat
along with the milkshake like it's just
be smart about it I always try to not
count calories but make sure that you're
not eating only junk food all day like
if I had McDonald's in the water
McDonald's for lunch I'm not going to
have Burger King for dinner you know
like everything is just a moderation for
me yesterday I had a mac and cheese for
dinner oh well but you know what for
breakfast I had a piece of toast with
peanut butter on it so it's just
everything is in moderation for me that
is my biggest thing I'm not going to
tell you guys what not to eat what to
eat because honestly I don't do that so
I don't want to tell you guys to do that
those are all the tips that I had I hope
