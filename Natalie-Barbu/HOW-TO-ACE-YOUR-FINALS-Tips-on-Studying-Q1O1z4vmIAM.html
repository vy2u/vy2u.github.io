I'm coming to you guys with a how to
study sounds kind of weird some tricks
of how to ace your finals how to study
for your finals just things that I've
learned along the way because I used to
be horrible at studying I didn't know
how to study I feel like I didn't really
study in high school and I came to
college it was like a foreign language
to me and I didn't know how to study for
all that information at once and final
exams are coming up my final exams
aren't in about like less than a month
and that's kind of freaking me out like
I'm not gonna lie I am very very nervous
I yeah I just
let's just not think about it but
anyways I am here to show you guys like
my tips and tricks of how to study
basically and I actually found this
website that helped me a lot and it will
help me a lot because I didn't know
about it last year which I wish I did
but it is called losing learn calm I
will link it down below
you guys gonna check it out but
basically what it is is you can't find
other people's study guides on there and
then you can contact tutors find people
splash bars make little like group
tutoring sessions all on this one
website so it's really cool because
basically what you can do is you can
also upload your own study guides so you
basically spend all year making notes
and making study guides is for every
single test I make like five study
guides just cuz I like rewriting
everything and then you put it to use
and you sell it and so if that brings me
to if you want to buy your son you guys
you totally can because I know when I
makes that you guys I like sitting in
groups just because it's easier for me
to study in groups because I don't
understand something I can like check
out their notes and then kind of
understand they so if you ever missed
out on notes or don't understand your
notes and just want another person's
brain to pick out I guess that you can
also buy your site guys off of this
website so it's super cool you can do it
by school by subjects by like specific
class literally buying anything you can
narrow it down you can make it super
broad and you didn't buy people study
guys but also you can find a tutor on
the
and I know I had a tutor last year and
it helped me so so much like I was right
around this let's say because the tears
are a lot cheaper and it's more students
that are tutors and for me I learn way
better when I just student teaching me
than when it's a professor because I
know a lot of times honestly this year
my professors have been is honestly like
they are very just I think out of touch
with how students can learn and
especially now I feel like where we need
to learn much more hands-on and I feel
like a lot of professors just lecture
and they're extremely brilliant and so
they forget to explain what they're
doing and then sometimes have to even
I'm in all about the science classes so
I need someone to explain step by step
and what they're doing and with the
students I feel like we understand each
other a lot more so you can actually
talk to this person so I will link that
down below for you guys to check it out
if you guys wanted to but now let's just
get into the tips and tricks and then I
have for you
tip number one is it might be obvious
but it is find a quiet place to study
I cannot study with noise I cannot study
with other people talking sometimes I
like a little bit of white noise makes a
little bit of sound in the background
but typically I kind of like studying in
a peaceful quiet environment which I
show you at my library it is awesome I'm
obsessed with NC State Library it's
called the James P hunt library it's
like the best thing ever it's so so nice
and I just whenever I go there I just
feel like I need to study because
everyone around me is studying also but
it's also just so quiet and peaceful and
you can preserve your own study room
which I'd only do and it is just awesome
so I typically go to a new library I
cannot send you to my room you guys like
I don't know why I just cannot do any
work in my room so what I recommend is
going in your library going to maybe a
coffee shop is what I do also a lot of
times but yeah just letting a quiet
place to study is definitely going to be
the most helpful tips if you are
anything like me tip number two is to
play classical music lightly in your
it's just kinda to distract from
everything else you might it's still
like a little bit of noise in the
background the classical music actually
has like I don't know if it's proven but
it has shown that a lot of people study
better with classical music and that
same church turn your brain better
because think about it if you're
listening to like rap music or pop music
you're going to be singing along to the
lyrics and then you're not gonna get
anything done classical music you don't
really sing along too it's just kind of
a nice peaceful background so that seems
to help me just kind of focus on what
I'm doing and kind of avoid not think
about all the distractions around me
because even though the library is my
place there is distractions just because
there's so many people in one spot tip
number three is to rewrite all of your
notes down and this one is the biggest
tip that I have I go through the
textbook and I rewrite every single
thing down not every single word no but
I write every single problem down until
I am completely a master at it or I will
write that I will make multiple study
guides just because writing everything
down if you come to me to rewrite
everything it will register in your
brain with her and like the more you
write the more you're gonna memorize it
that is just hands-down I think that
will work for every single person if you
have never done it and you don't think
it works try it and tell me if it works
because I know it though
you just have to rewrite everything and
then it sticks in your brain think about
it if you're rewriting a bunch of stuff
everything that you're rewriting you're
gonna keep registering each time you
rewrite that study guide another tip I
have is to look at other people's study
guides this is kind of a sink tip but
look at other people said guys it will
help you so much whatever I have to
attest to study for I will kind of try
to look up things so I live and learn I
look up other people's study guides I
know that if I've read something a
Viking write rewriting the same study
guide down and I miss information on
that same study guide it's not gonna
help me because I don't have that
information so make sure you compare
your study guide to other peoples
because that will help you so much and I
will just make sure that you know
and then if you're like wow I didn't
know you could think about it that way
or I don't know we need to know that now
you know so definitely look at other
people's study guides and rewrite them
guys if you don't rewrite your study
guides I don't even know how do you
study because that is the only way I can
study by rewriting everything and making
sure I know it
each time I rewrite it ever form might
sound like a weird one but it is
actually to wear comfy clothes but do
not wear PJs
do not just lounge around in sweatpants
on a baked t-shirt and no bra and hair
up and that just doesn't help you study
for me personally it might help you guys
but what I like to wear I like wearing
comfy clothes but also close the hi
don't go to sleep in so I when I wore it
was I wore a pair of leggings and they
were actually like cute leggings but
they were still legging so they're super
comfortable then I just wore a loose
t-shirt this teacher was from everyone
and a cardigan because you can take it
on or off in case you get hot or cold
because studying longer really hot or
really cold is the worse so you can kind
of adjust the temperature with this and
then I just heard a necklace it just
made me feel put together but not like
I'm about to go to bed because I could
not study from go out to go to bed
because then I feel like you know I
don't have to go to sleep I want to go
to sleep the studying is boring it is
extremely boring so you don't want to
accidentally fall asleep while you're
studying you don't want to be
uncomfortable I'm not recommending you
go to the library in high heels and
tight jeans and a tight t-shirt or tight
tank top with like a bunch of jewelry on
you know wear comfortable clothes but
wear clothes that you're not going to
fall asleep it's a tip for you guys is
to form study groups I do this before
every single test and I had a lot of fun
filming this video we're just kind of
like making jokes and laughing and stuff
and not actually studying in the video
but I actually was kind of copying down
my cup my calculus mess of this but so
what I do is I want study groups and I
just we just kind of talk about what we
need to know in the test and write
bullet notes and do problems and again
having another person it helps so much
and also on lube you learn you
do group studies so you can you like
they sent with Betty people and the good
thing is like if you don't know anyone
in your classes you can form them on
this website about people that are
taking the same subject as you and learn
through that so I thought that was
pretty cool but you have forming study
groups helped so much like it's just
another brain that to pick at I think
they've said that expression let's see
maybe like five times today maybe I'm
gonna live never like use that
expression before number six is to pack
snacks and drink coffee I actually did
not have snacks in this video but I
definitely ordered a coffee I always get
a latte with soy milk but caffeine I
thought it just is a great thinking up
and I normally do it in the middle of my
study session because if you do it in
the beginning you might be crashing at
the end but if you do it in the middle
in the beginning you're still kind of
have energy from like the day if I'm not
studying and then you slowly slowly
crash and then you have coffee in your
backup so that elongates your setting
time so my tip is to have coffee in the
middle of your study break you're not
just in the beginning like most people
would do you could have it multiple
times in your studying session but I
mean um maybe to be a little healthier
you should only have it once but just
one cup of coffee or one order of coffee
you have one order of coffee in what I
normally do and I normally have that in
the middle of my study session so yeah
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
hope these tips help you out the time

study tips works best for you because

or more final exam helps or if you want
to show you how like if your we kind of
like to vlog me studying that sounds
like the most boring thing ever so I
probably won't do that but you don't I'm

classes let me know
