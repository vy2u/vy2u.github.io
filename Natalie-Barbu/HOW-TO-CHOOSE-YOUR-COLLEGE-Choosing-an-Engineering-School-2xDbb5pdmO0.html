I'm coming with another College Tuesday
video I really need to come up with a
better name for that because it's
overflow at all it's the most generic
thing ever
some of you guys have any ideas for a
college Tuesday name maybe like
something that recipe Adam else comment
down below
is today we are talking about how to
choose your college so kind of how to
decide where to go to school what
college is the best fit for you so I am
breaking me down into categories to just
make it a lot easier in the end in here
please be sure to subscribe down below i
post videos every Tuesday and every
Friday and this summer I started a
series on kind of helping guys choose
major teacher college so now today I am
doing a how to choose your college I
think that's honestly such a tough
decision for so many of you guys and
before I get started I want to let you
guys know that this video I had an
amazing opportunity to sponsor with
University of New South Wales which is
in Sydney Australia or in a suburb of
Sydney Australia and Kingsley pin and I
am so unbelievably excited you guys like
I don't know about you guys but I think
that is a cool thing that they reached
out to me and I just like once I started
researching the school I fell in love
with it and now I honestly want to go
there I'm about to be a senior in
college so it's a little late for me but
maybe if I go to grad school I don't
know he just looks amazing I'm going to
tell you guys about it I am going to
break this video down into categories so
breaking it down into have it already
sound you guys I didn't know this series
I have a lot of notes I'm bringing it
down into what to do you want to do with
location what does the school offer you
rankings and student life so that is the
top things that I asked myself were the
things that I looked at I was choosing
to school I'm just kind of talk about
every single one and then within each
category tell you about the University
of New South Wales if that is an option
for you guys I think that would be oh my
gosh like I'm excited I'm so excited for
this video I was like texting my
boyfriend like oh my gosh kid Knight can
I transfer they're like do you mind if I
moved all the way across the world
because I would love to the first
question that I ask myself is what do I
want to do and a lot of people go to
college and have literally no idea what
their major is so this
not be helpful for everyone but if you
have any slight idea of what you want to
do you should probably apply to colleges
that have your major in it because you
don't want to go to a school realize
want to do something and then have to
transfer once you've made your friends
with people kind of fall in love with
the place
so I knew to cover with you though you
haven't totally watched my other videos
but try to help make your decision but
not then go to a college that has kind
of a broad range of majors or applied to
schools that have a broader range of
majors just so that once you do decide
you're not trapped and going to just one
and then they don't have it but that is
my number one thing like don't apply to
so many schools that you are going to be
so overwhelmed and don't apply to so
many tools that you're just applying
just because because it takes a lot of
time and I feel like you should want to
make an effort to kind of apply to your
dream school and get a couple backup
ones personally I applied to only four
colleges I did not apply to many I wish
I applied to a little more but I think
anything more than seven is a little too
much at that point you should kind of
have an idea of what you want to do or
what to the school you want to go to and
what you could afford also number one
thing I thought was what do I want to do
I knew I wanted to go into engineering
so I literally just applied to
engineering school that was my main uh
priority University of New South Wales
has so many different majors to choose
from they have from engineering to
medicines and fitness and they are
really great at all of them to make sure
to go to the school with a plenty of
majors to choose from if you are
undecided and if you are a hundred
percent set go to school that has your
major I feel like that's kind of common
sense but you'd be surprised a lot of
people apply to schools like a lot of
people I know wanted to do nursing and
they literally knew they wanted to do
nursing while going into college and
still chose NC State and NC State does
not have nursing so they have the
transfer after two years which I don't
know what you would want to do that
because eventually you're going to fall
in love with the place in your gum not
going to want to transfer and then
you're going to settle for a major that
you're unhappy in the next thing is
location so if you make no mean you
there's no that I am a huge city person
I do not like being in the middle of
nowhere I would never want to go to a
school in the middle of nowhere
I would mainly between NC State and
Clemson and I show those you take
because a city life but definitely
think about where you want to go you
guys want to go to a city or do you guys
want to go to a small college town you
guys want to be by the beach or do you
guys want to be in the mountains doors
like not cold or warm you know you guys
want to be in a close to home or far
away and as I'm Regis researching
University of New South Wales the
location is just like gold I mean let me
throw that out there it's in Sydney
Australia first of all like what I've
never personally been to Sydney
Australia but my dad's made a couple
times and that's one of his favourite
cities in the world except it's amazing
besides a long plane ride to get there
she says it's such a beautiful place and
it is very similar to the u.s. like he's
didn't feel like oh this is such a
different place like so if you're from
the US it is similar to it but it's just
so beautiful and it's enough different
that like you should definitely go visit
in your lifetime so that's definitely on
my bucket list I would love to go
through Sydney Australia oh my god
think about like if you guys could go
for an adventure and go away from home
I'm at a hundred bucks I consider
applying to schools outside of the
country but really I just lost a leg
when I was researching this college um a
while ago because I was thinking of the
days I was applying to college and I
wish I knew that going into an
international school would be an option
I've never thought about it and I don't
know I just like would have loved to be
able to do that I was only thinking like
Oh city or country side or like city or
middle of nowhere but like I never
really thought about going abroad and I
so sort of like both of my parents are
international students first of all so
my mom she was telling me how when she
came to the u.s. from Honduras she
literally didn't know anyone um she
moved here just to have an education she
literally just moved here for school she
didn't move because like for a better
life or whatever like she just moved
here because she loved to go to school
here she was telling me that that was
the best decision of her life going to
another country so I think that if you
would have the opportunity to apply to
another place that you're not familiar
with you won't like if something in you
wants that do it even applying won't
hurt you if you just apply I don't know
I just
I really really wish that I had done
that when I was younger so I want to
give you guys the best advice possible
because I like I said I only applied to
Ford school to my wish I applied to a
couple more so I don't I need to make
the same like regrets that I have not
exactly enough big tip for me it doesn't
hurt to apply and if you guys want to be
as the adventurous type definitely do
that I think I ask myself is what does
the school offer me so color is very
complex because it's not just like a
religious school middle school high
school where you just go in you learn
and you leave like maybe you're a part
of a club maybe you're on the school
sports team or whatever but that's a
like it doesn't really offer you that
much like in high school I never was in
any really like main clubs like big
clubs and if I was just honestly to put
it on my college application and not I
was at that a part of it and then saying
look like guidance counselor's in high
school like I never once met with like
items counselor like I never you know
like in the school they're just for me
to learn and to get out but college is
so much different than that and I wanted
to school that off of me more than just
a classroom I'm making sure that the
school had more to offer me than just
sitting down and learning I wanted to be
a part of something so schools like the
University of New South Wales for
example they have an entrepreneurship
Center and I thought that was what I was
looking into the most what I was looking
at their website because that to me I
eventually want to own my own business
someday that is like the goal in my life
is to own my own business someday and I
would have loved like right out of
college I would love to work for a
start-up if I worked for a company I
would love to work for a start-up for
the large company I just like that
feeling of entrepreneurship like being
more involved doing something like
you're only having new ideas like
getting ideas flowing and everything
like that like working with small groups
create something so much bigger and I
just love that I love I don't know that
it's just what I want to do later in
life so what I was talking about
peacefully they had an entrepreneurship
Center which a lot of other schools have
with NC State has also an entrance
entrepreneurship Center where you can go
it's kind of like a club and they
sometimes they take trips and whatever
but this place literally they have a
legal team at the office because I feel
when you have a startup and you're a 22
year old college student or a 21 year
old college student you have no idea
about the legalities of starting your
own business and people consume you and
you're responsible for a lot more than
you are just being a normal kid you know
they have a prototype Development Center
you go there and help build your own
prototype they have a lot of mentors and
faculty that will help you and that have
worked with entrepreneurship and maybe
started their own company to that know
kind of our ins and outs of it
and I just thought that was really cool
that they put such an emphasis on it
because a lot of schools now I feel like
focus on work here and go to a big
company and make a lot of money at a big
company and work for one of the fortune
500 companies whatever and that's great
they should emphasize that but I feel
like a lot of schools lack emphasizing
starting your own thing like that is
something that I admire a lot about
people that start their own business
because I feel how hard it is my dad
started his own business so that's kind
of something that you passed out to me
how rewarding it is to be an
entrepreneur and so if you're looking at
schools and you want to do that make
sure that they have things like that
which it's not just learning it's so
much more than that it's applying what
you learn and actually taking steps for
your future a lot of small schools may
not offer things like that and it's not
in it you don't want anything like that
and that's fine it's not for you but if
you do want something more look at the
things that they offer see if they have
stuff like that on their site look at
reviews go to Couture at the canvas in
the ask them you know also if you want
to do research not every school as a
Research Institute just so you guys know
like not many schools out there do
research so that's what something you're
interested in make sure that you go to a
school like that I know where I go to
school it's the Triangle area and they
have a ton all the universities and can
take using you in University of North
Carolina they're all research institutes
so it's a great place for the job or for
jobs and it's great for research because
you have so much access to so many
different universities so when you've
heard people the School University of
New South Wales something that I thought
was really interesting is that they have
an innovate in server that can tell they
have innovation
they offer for free so I was looking at
the innovations that they have and they
literally offered to you for free so
students and faculty there that have
come up with these amazing innovations
and they're offering it for free for
because they just think that innovation
is what's going to make the world better
and if they offer it for free that is
out there and it's just going to make
the world a better place and I think
that's such an amazing thing to be a
part of also when looking for what the
school offers you do you want to study
abroad in the future because if you do
that might be definitely something to
look at see which schools have the best
study abroad programs or where would you
want to study abroad is your school that
you're looking at study abroad to that
location Murphy and myself will also
offer people to study abroad
there so if you an are so interested in
the school that I'm talking about but
you know that your parents will never in
a million years let you go to an
international school they have
opportunities to study abroad there this
is why colleges so complex and it's so
hard because it's not just a classroom
and where you're going to learn like oh
whatever it's just I'm going to live in
this place like it's so much more than
that
the next thing that I looked at was the
rink angle I knew that I personally
wanted to go to a school that was ranked
well in what I wanted to do which is MP
marrying so I looked at great
engineering schools and even if the
school was it ranked overall amazing if
their engineering departments or that's
all I looked at because I knew that
would be the department I was in
University of New South Wales was
actually the best university in
Australia and then there actually be 49
in the world think of how many colleges
there are in your state or in the
country and they're reporting on in the
world I thought was really great I never
knew that it was such an amazing school
until I looked after it I wanted to go
to a good school and they stopped
important for you make sure that you
look at rankings and apply but I also
recommend having back up schools because
top schools are very hard to get into
and it doesn't mean that you're not
smart if you don't get into the top
schools please don't think that
don't let everything define you don't
let it don't go to a great breaking
school it really matters all that
matters is that you are getting the most
out of what your school is that's why I
put it right things kind of at the end
because that's kind of after every
school has your checklist of like
location I wanted to offer you what is
the majors that it offers things like
that then you should look at ranking
instead of just wanting to go to like
Harvard or whatever and then look at
that you want to make sure that your
school has a good Career Center so like
I was looking for a few big soils I'm
kind of modeling all of these after that
they had a career portal where they post
hundreds of new jobs there for their
students and that is good because those
drops are specifically going to the
university being like we want to hire
people from your school so that's why
you already have an advantage whether if
you just looked it up on Google you know
you already have an advantage because
those people want to hire graduates from
the University of New South Wales so I
thought that was really cool that they
have like hundreds of people hundreds of
employers on there any school that has
resources like that you know you are
going to get the bang from your bus
because it actually wants to help you
guys and the next thing is student life
again college is not just four years of
learning being in the classroom and
leaving college is four years of your
whole life like when you are in college
called the college is kind of like your
life like you get the whole college
experience that you can lose student
life so do you want a school that has a
Greek life you guys what don't want a
co-ed freak like you want a Christian
school if you want a non-religious
school that will be impacted by the
student life because that determines
what you guys do when you're not in the
classroom so for me student life is very
important I want to make sure that there
was always things to do and that was a
sub school
hi Joe's a big city so like Sydney
Australia there is so much to do they
are you guys and I was actually looking
and they have this thing called the Ark
and it's like literally all of student
right so like food is there it's a free
program or free like Club I don't even
know honks they have over 290 clubs with
if this one thing yeah a lot of sports
they have a lot of club sports like
intramural sports is that important see
make sure that you ask yourself this
question so I know I'm talking about one
specific school when I'm giving examples
but this is just in general like to talk
about anything in general like you need
to make sure that your school checks off
all of these things that you want and
it's not going to be the same for
everyone which is why schools are so
different like not every college is
going to be the same and not everyone is
the same so there is a place for
everyone and ask yourself what you want
you want schools a lot of options or do
you want school which is secure hold
actually invest it those are all of the
categories that I looked at I hope this
videos made 7q guys because I was just
talking to you guys like chillin like
we're friends you know let me know what
schools you guys apply to and comment
below and if you want to apply for
University of New South Wales I will
leave a link down below again thank you
guys so much for letting me do stomp
your videos because this means the world
to me and I I I don't know I'm really
happy right many guys I'm really happy
don't because oh I'm getting paid
whatever I'm happy because I'm doing
things that matter like I am so many
comments telling me you are helping me
so much with my college decision process
and I know how hard that is for me when
I was 18 or 17 however old I was when I
was applying to college and like having
someone to talk to me about it and to
give me more options that help kind of
help me think of what to look at really
would have helped that side so I'm glad
I'm helping guys out have a name for the
college Tuesdays because College Tuesday
sounds so boring and I'm singing
terrifying Tuesday's because this
literally terrifying to find college but
people might not get that thanks guys so
much if you're not applying to
