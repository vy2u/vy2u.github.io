today I am deciding to fill a little bit
of a different video and kind of go a
different route that I was originally
planning on going this Tuesday but it's
really something that has been on my
heart and that I just felt like I needed
to film this video or else I was
ignoring God in my ear telling me to
film this so it might be a little random
it might be a little all over the place
but I feel like it's definitely
necessary and I hope that if any of you
are listening and you guys need to hear
this I really really hope it helps and
yeah so I guess we're just gonna talk
about this I wanted to talk a lot about
kind of boys relationships friendships
and self-love kind of all in one video
and I know that's a lot of different
topics to cover but I just felt like I
needed to talk about this because it is
something that I have been seeing kind
of everywhere in my own life and with
others and in the comments below
actually one of my videos how to deal
with the breakup has kind of become a
little more popular again so I've been
getting a lot of comments and that and I
just wanted to address everyone in the
comments and kind of help anyone out the
best way that I can or anyone that kind
of feels alone and needs to hear some
girl talk advice I feel like as girls we
are constantly searching for guys
approval or just people's approval so
whether that is through Instagram likes
whether that is through text messaging
whether that is through snapchatting
whether that is through physical touch
whether that is through compliments or
word of affirmation
I feel like us as girls in general and
boys - but I'm just speaking for my own
experience that we just feel like guys
kind of dictate whether we are beautiful
whether we are wanted whether we are
important or whether we're better than
that girl or better than that person or
whether we are worth anything and I feel
like a lot of our self-worth comes from
the approval of other boys and I say
boys because I don't think a man will
make you feel this way so I'm just gonna
say boys cuz I just feel like that's the
most appropriate term for
especially ones in college which is the
ones I'm specifically talking about
there's this idea that if we have X
amount of guys that like us or we have a
list of guys that we're talking to her a
list of options that we're talking to
then we're somehow better because we
have approval from them and then it also
goes vice-versa that when we feel like
we don't have a guy's attention or we
don't have people liking us or we don't
have anyone that we're texting at the
moment our approval is shot and it's on
the floor and our self-esteem is broken
and we think what is wrong with me why
doesn't he like me why doesn't that
person like want to talk to me why am i
trying so hard for someone that isn't
and everything starts to think like what
am i doing what am i doing why do I hate
myself
all of it like everything is on us and I
just it hurts that I see so many people
saying that and I see girls in the
comments of my videos telling me like
what did I do wrong why did he break up
with me what did I do what didn't I had
it's just the idea that we owe a random
college guy something or that we don't
have something that they're looking for
and we never start to think well what if
they are just not meant for me like what
if that person is just not meant to be
in my life or what if that person is
just too immature and stupid and blind
to not see what is right in front of him
and not everyone is meant for someone
else I think that's another thing people
need to realize that if two people are
really really fun together and they both
one person like someone else and the
other person doesn't really like them
back that's not a crime like no we're
not forced to like people we're not
forced to if someone's nice then we're
forced to show them love back you know
like if a guy likes you and you don't
like him it might not necessarily be
anything he's doing wrong it just might
not work and it just might not click and
I think and it's nothing about them and
deep in our heart we're like yeah it's
nothing about them they're so nice
they're cute they're make they're funny
I just don't see them that way and
that's totally fine and that shouldn't
be held against us but the thing is weak
instantly are saying that there's
something wrong with us because they
don't like us we need to change to make
the boy like me I just hate that there
are so many girls and I have fallen into
this too that feel the need to change or
alter themselves or even just hate
themselves because they're not what if
guy is looking for and sometimes it just
doesn't work like that and it has
nothing to do with you if a guy is
cannot see how beautiful you are if a
guy cannot see how special and unique
and how amazing you are
I don't think that they deserve you
because the right guy will be the one
that sees that he will notice it without
you having to flash it in his face
without you having to be like hey look
at me look at me hello I'm over here
without you having to do that they're
gonna notice you in a crowd
they're gonna purposely go out of their
way to see you and they're gonna
purposely go out of their way to see how
beautiful you are or not to see how
beautiful you are but they're not gonna
have to think oh is she
they're gonna see it because it's you
you in their eyes is that person is that
beautiful girl is that person that they
want to be with and if they see that and
if they can realize that there's nothing
to be anything in their way stopping
them from showing you and I think that's
also a difference that a lot of girls
are like well he tells me I'm pretty but
I mean like he also tells other people
that they're prettier he tells me I'm
pretty but he doesn't like text me every
day or something like that he doesn't
give me the attention that I need or I
see my friend over there with that guy
and she seems so happy and I hang out
all the time and I am not like that with
this guy even though he tells me that he
likes me I feel like everyone knows this
but no one wants to say it if a guy
likes you they are going to show it and
you won't have to question it and I
think that's so important and what I've
learned from my own relationships and I
know every relationship is different so
it's not like one size fits all advice
I'm just saying from a kind of general
standpoint that typically when someone
likes someone they'll do little things
to show it whether and even if you can't
physically be together they'll maybe I
don't know like let you know and
reassure
you and I'm definitely the type of
person that I need reassurance and I
need someone to tell me hey look I
haven't forgotten about you I love you
and that is the type of person I am and
that's what I need and I've done like
the love languages quiz and I am
definitely a words of affirmation person
they're going to do whatever it takes to
show you if they appreciate you because
when you love someone you want to be
with them when you love someone you're
gonna show them in different ways in
your own way you're not just gonna show
it with your words which I know I said I
where's the bad form agent but you're
not just gonna show with your words
you're also going to show it with your
actions so yes I'm a words of
affirmation person but the words need to
be backed up by action which is hey like
I was thinking about you today how was
your test or something like that if you
can't physically be together or hey like
jump on this call I really want to hear
your voice or I want to like get lunch
with you get coffee with you see you for
five minutes out of my day because I
can't stop thinking about you and I know
it's not always like that forever like
when you're in a relationship and stuff
things can get a little more comfortable
and you don't do that as much still
think it's important to keep it up and
always flirt with your girlfriend or
boyfriend I just think it keeps things a
little bit more romantic and better and
fresh but anyway that's a whole
different video they are going to show
it and you won't have to question it and
I think that's what I'm trying to get at
is that if you are stressing if you
right now our girl you're crying right
now or you're upset because the guy
won't text you back her because the guy
at the party that you slept with hasn't
talked to you yet or the guy that is
like I don't know like that you care
about and that you want to get his
attention and you want to know how he
feels if you're that person just know
that there is someone out there that
won't make you feel this way he's not
gonna make you question it and I've been
there before that is why I'm telling you
this I'm not saying this is like oh
she's just in a happy relationship she
doesn't know or I know a lot of people
are like well my relationship is
different I I have a like he's different
like he's tells me these things and I
forgive him and what
I don't know what it is because I've
been there and I know how to it is to
make excuses for the guy that you like
or how it is to make excuses for your
boyfriend or how it is to make to just
feel not wanted and all my friends
always gave me this advice that if they
liked you they would show you you
wouldn't have to question if someone
likes you and I think that is the number
one thing to remember because girls
especially in college feel like we are a
prize for guys or something like that
because we let guys control our every
emotion they control our life they
control and I know not everyone but for
a lot of times at least once you will
get sucked into that and you will look
for their approval and you will start to
forget your own self-worth and that is
so damaging and it will break your heart
and I feel like we need to guard our
hearts and I'm trying to make this video
as like a girl-power video like you
don't need a guy in your life that is
going to treat me that way
a guy should compliment you and should
lift you up it shouldn't be like oh my
other half like I've always have kind of
thought it was weird when people use the
expression oh he's my other half because
I never want to not have half of me if I
don't have a guy I think that's a really
toxic mindset that oh they're my other
half with my boyfriend is my other half
I want to be a whole self I want to be
my own person and if a guy comes along
and he complements me then that is great
but I'm not giving away half of me to
suit you if that makes any sense and I
think that is a great lesson that you
guys should take away that your other
half should be yourself
you shouldn't have another half and you
should like it's not wrong to say like
oh I want a boyfriend or whatever but
you shouldn't settle you shouldn't
settle for a guy you should have a guy
that complements you that goes out of
his way to make sure that he's in your
life that doesn't have you questioning
your self-worth that is my number one
thing and I was reading my Bible this
morning and I had need to do that more
often if I'm being honest but I was just
thinking about God's love for us and how
powerful that is
that we don't even have to ever question
his love for us I never feel like God
doesn't love me and if I do it's not
coming from him it's coming from my own
insecurities in a relationship same goes
for links in relation to show question
as we're that man's love for you you
should feel it by the way he shows it
God shows us every day how much he loves
us he we have his book right in our
hands and we can read his own words and
his own teachings and he sent His only
Son to sacrifice for people that didn't
deserve it and that is love a guy not
texting you back and not showing it not
like hanging out with you and not being
nice to you or not being loyal to you is
not love and we should not confuse that
because we know what it is and I know
I'm saying this from a Christian
standpoint and many of you might not be
Christian and that is totally okay
because I'm just trying to give you my
advice I just want you to know where I
am coming from and how I what makes me
feel better when I'm feeling low and
yeah I don't know I just really I needed
to film this I needed to film this and
I'm kind of like I've been really
emotional lately and I just feel like
someone needs to hear this out there and
I hope that if you need to hear this
you're watching this and I hope you guys
can save this video if you ever feel
doubt of who you are and how beautiful
you are and how or how priceless you are
and no one should ever take that for
granted and I'm saying that for me I'm
saying that for you I'm saying that for
every girl out there and every boy out
there no one should make you feel
anything less than you are because they
do not deserve you they do not
appreciate you and yeah
a guy should just only lift you up and
make you feel good about yourself not
the opposite because that is not love
and I just really I needed to film this
I needed to I'm sorry if this kind of
like isn't this I have a video that I
usually film and that if you guys are
upset or anything like that but I also
want
comments-section to be a very positive
and uplifting comment section so I would
love to hear any of your advice I would
love to hear any of your stories I would
love to reply to a bunch of comments and
give you my advice if you want to hear
it if you don't that's totally fine
advice is not necessarily a hundred
percent like you need to take my advice
or else I don't like you like my advice
is just here to help anyone if they need
it if it didn't help anyone that's fine
but if you didn't need to hear this I
hope it helps and I really want this
comment section to be uplifting so

I love you guys so much you guys don't
understand how much like my viewers and
the people that comment on my video mean
to me because I see you guys as like my
little sister or my little sister's age
or like people in my high school that
maybe I like wasn't friends with but
they might get anything out of this I
don't know anything people that I have
never met that are halfway across the
world that have different life
experiences to me they have a different
life than me I have people that live in
the Middle East that live in Europe that
live in Asia that live in Africa that
live in South America and they live in
all sorts of different cultures and
lifestyles and we still could come
together on this channel and talk about
life and advice and just uplift each
