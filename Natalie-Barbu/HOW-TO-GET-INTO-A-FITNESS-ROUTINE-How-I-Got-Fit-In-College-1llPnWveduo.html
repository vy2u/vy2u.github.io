Natalie here and today I am coming to
you guys with a fitness video and just a
way to kind of help you guys develop a
fitness routine and I have been getting
so many comments about this so ever
since I have been kind of doing these
week in my life's and weekend in my life
switch side now if you haven't checked
them out definitely do so and if you
want to keep watching some more of them
subscribe to this channel I have been
getting so many comments because in
those videos I show you guys when I go
to the gym I basically go to the gym
five to six times every week so I show
that to you guys and a lot of you guys
have been asking me for a fitness
routine how I got in shape anything like
that and I'm so excited because I love
filming these like fitness and healthy
eating and just like uplifting videos
because I feel like fitness and eating
healthy come in hand with being
uplifting so I'm really excited and
before I continue talking be sure to
subscribe if you're new here follow me
on Instagram if you want to see any
updates of mine and then without further
ado let's just get into the video so the
way this video is gonna work is I'm
gonna have it set up so one's gonna be
Fitness and then one is going to be food
related options get started with tip
number one it is to stop buying junk
foods this is like the very first year
that I've truly stuck to it and I know
it's still January but I really have
been very strict on myself so me and my
roommate have started eating together
and shopping for food together just
because it's cheaper and it helps so
that things don't go bad but we both
have been on a mission to stop eating
like crap so we don't buy potato chips
we don't buy chips and salsa anymore and
I love salsa but I know that if I have
salsa in my fridge I'm gonna eat a whole
bag of tortilla chips with it so I don't
buy that anymore I try not to buy much
like candy or mainly my weaknesses
potato chips in all honesty and like
frozen food and mac and cheese
oh my goodness I have to stop buying
that completely because if it's in my
pantry and in my fridge I am going to
eat it so I have been trying to find
healthier alternatives so instead of
potato chips for example you can buy
popcorn and popcorn still gives you that
crunch
basically kind of tastes like potato
chips except it's so much better for you
another thing is if you're wanting just
like a crunch or something like that
keep your fridge stocked with vegetables
seriously I know that that sounds so
like lame but even if you want to add a
ranch to it which is not healthy but
just like a little tiny bit if that's
really the way to get you to eat your
veggies then do it keep broccoli red
peppers green peppers pickled off my
favorite you know so just keep those in
your fridge so that you can snack on
those instead of snacking on something
else that's a lot worse for you another
thing that I like to switch out is this
whole year I am going soda free so I
don't I'm not a heavy soda drinker but I
really week or so I'll drink at least
like one soda probably every two weeks
so I am now pledging to cut soda out of
my diet for this whole year and
hopefully for good but starting with a
year giving myself actually realistic
goals so instead of soda which I
sometimes crave like crazy I have been
just drinking sparkling water or
carbonated water you can get lucre you
can get like the sony has sparkling
water literally anything but sparkling
water is not bad for you at all so that
is definitely what I have been doing and
it really helps me get that like
carbonation that I'm wanting at that
moment the second thing is to wake up
early so that you can get a workout in
and I know I say this is literally every
video but it is probably my most
important tried-and-true one of these
fitness tips and you guys wanted to know
how I have gotten into shape and this is
seriously number one I used to work out
at night like after my classes and after
I've done everything for the day but
that's kind of like prioritizing your
workout last so if you're tired if you
have extra homework and you can't work
out it's kind of like oh well I'm too
busy you wake up an hour earlier than
you normally do you literally have no
excuses because you wouldn't even be up
at that time so just get it out of the
way you also feel so accomplished and so
much better about yourself after you
finish a workout and it's like 8:00 a.m.
seriously you guys it's one of the
greatest feelings and I know it takes a
while to get used to no one wants to get
up early to work out like that
I don't like want to do that but after a
while you really do get into the routine
and you get used to it and then you're
gonna start feeling better and you're
kind
I'm gonna want to keep going and keep
doing it and after a week or two weeks
or even three weeks you are going to
just it's gonna be routine you're gonna
do it you're gonna feel great and you're
not gonna want to stop so the next tip
is to drink more water and I know this
sounds also like another one that a lot
of people say but for me if I'm feeling
hungry and I'm just like what the heck I
literally just finished eating I drink
some water because most likely that
means I'm thirsty so keep a water bottle
with you at all times keep like one that
you can keep refilling also I have an
app it's called a water minder you don't
need to get it it's actually I think
like three dollars I really don't know
why I paid money for it but I paid money
for it so if you want to get it I mean I
like it but I'm sure that there's free
ones out there and it just reminds me to
drink water and you can record how much
you drink and a half like a little thing
that shows you how much you're drinking
throughout the day I don't know it's a
cool app I really like it but get
something like that to keep you
accountable for how much water you're
drinking because a lot of times when you
do think you're hungry you're actually
thirsty and I have gone days I feel like
without I've done like a whole day
without ever drinking water and I'm just
like wait what's like how how did I do
that so the next thing is to mix up your
workout routine so I know a lot of
people say that they don't like working
out because it's boring they don't
they're not excited to work out and I'm
not gonna lie
sometimes I'm that annoying person
that's like really excited to get my
workout in because they love what I'm
about to do for example later today I'm
going to a yoga class and I absolutely
love hot yoga like I truly do enjoy hot
yoga that gets me excited I want to go
to that class I went to a cycling class
the other day I love cycling classes and
it gets you excited to go for me I have
really really liked Orangetheory
Lovett's I like cycling classes a lot I
like going to like cardio like hit
classes I really love hot yoga like
that's like one of my favorite things to
do but just switch it up so don't if you
don't like cycling in - not everyone
likes like like for example my mom she
hates hot yoga and she hates cycling me
and her we're not compatible in that
sense so she does other things that gets
her excited so hopefully definitely if
you're feeling kind of stuck in a rut
and your type of running on the
treadmill you do not have to run on the
treadmill do you get results I don't
remember the last time I ran on a
treadmill like I barely ever ever ever
used the treadmill
so next one is to start planning your
meals and I'm not necessarily talking
about meal prepping you can do that and
that's great but I don't want to give
you advice that I don't do I'm normally
don't meal prep if I don't make like a
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday like
box of food but I whenever I cook and
make extra food so that I can store it
so just for my next few meals however
long the leftovers last I have something
healthy to eat so for example in my
fridge I have rice beans vegetables and
ham pretty sure it's just like rice
beans and a bunch of vegetables in a
bowl kind of like a burrito bowl and I
have been eating that for the past like
three days or something like that and it
normally lasts me about three meals so
it's enough to not get me super bored of
that food but because I made extra of it
and it's sitting in my fridge it is so
easy for me to just heat it up and eat
it versus me having to remake it and
then normally when we're busy we choose
to eat crappy food the other one is set
to by cute workout clothes so this one
you're probably like it's not gonna help
me get in shape but maybe
psychologically the way I think I'm
again I'm using all of these from my own
experiences by the way I think is that
if you have cute workout clothes you're
gonna want to go and show them off do
you not like when I have a cute outfit I
cannot wait to go out and show it off
like I hate what I'm wearing a cute
outfit and no one sees it it's literally
the worst so when I buy a cute workout
outfit I want to show it off and where
do you show out workout clothes when
you're working out at the gym at a
workout class something like that so
whenever you have cute workout club work
way the I cannot talk when you might
keep working on clothes and you want to
wear them you are going to wear them to
the gym and don't use this as binding
keep working clothes and wearing them at
home and wearing it's class and then sit
in back in your lazy bed no actually put
them to use so it's kind of like a
rewarding yourself but also I mean for
me if I'm gonna wear something cute I'm
gonna wear it out and I want people to
see me in it the next one is to start
slowly taking things out of your diet so
like I said to stop buying junk food I
think that is a pretty easy thing for me
to do kind of like cold turkey but if
you don't want to do a cold turkey then
start slowly taking things out so
another example is I have wanted to stop
drinking cow's milk I don't I'm not a
vegan I still eat meat I still will
drink dairy or eat dairy in some things
but in general as a whole I have been
trying to cut out cow's milk as much as
I can because I don't like the way it
makes me feel so I have instead of going
to Starbucks and just ordering my latte
with regular milk I have been subbing
that for coconut milk so let's take a
little while to get used to for me
because I used to drink milk like every
single day but now I like love coconut
milk and I don't even miss my old
Starbucks order so if you just start
slowly taking things out of your diet
like I stopped buying cheese in my
fridge so we have like some cheese but
not really I started buying vegan cheese
I've started buying vegan butter so when
I do try to eat like vegan
I'll try subbing it for that you know
like I I'm not a vegan I'm not
considering myself a vegan by any means
but I do like limiting my dairy intake
and I have been slowly doing it and now
I don't really miss cow's milk or dairy
or anything like that so even if you
feel like you can't do something right
away like it's too hard you don't have
to that's the great thing about a
fitness journey you take things at your
own pace so whether that's instead of
drinking a glass of milk five times a
week start drinking at three times a
week and then slowly you'll start
checking it twice and then never that's
how you wean off of things cold turkey I
know is so hard and I don't do that
really with much so if you just wean off
of it that's even a huge improvement and
in a couple months or a year from now
you will see how far you have come so
the next thing is probably something
that has helped me a ton it's helped me
actually quite a bit is to use a workout
program so I feel like for me personally
I didn't start going to the gym I never
went to my school gym until junior year
of college which was last year so I
never even stepped foot in the free gym
that has access accessible to us at NC
State because I was scared and I know a
lot of you guys feel the same exact way
so I was terrified because I feel like
it's only like big macho guys that go
there or like girls that are super fit
and like like ripped and I'm just
sitting there like what to do like I
don't know what these machines do I
don't I don't know how to like lift
weights like what I got a workout
program and the workout program I'm
using is the sweat by Kayla so it is the
BBG bikini body guide 12-week program
and I have been on and off of it for
quite a while like I've always gone up
slick
weeks and then I've stopped and licked
on something else and then like seven
weeks and I've stopped and done
something out I'm about to finish my
twelfth week you guys which is like the
first part of the program like the first
12 weeks it's like the huge milestone so
I'm so proud of myself
but I have been using that to sweat by
Kayla app it's so amazing it tells you
exactly what to do shows you a video of
how to do it and it's simple enough that
you're not gonna be scared or anything I
have been absolutely loving it it has
been completely what has transformed my
body and if I wasn't for that program I
really think I just been running on the
treadmill and getting so bored and
stopping and then restarting and
stopping and restarting and stopping and
restarting and you guys get it get with
the program whether it's the Kayla app
or anything else I also like Nike
Training Club but I like something that
tells me what to do because I honestly
feel like I don't know what to do when
I'm not using something and the next
thing is to give yourself a little bit
of mercy so this one is so important
because I sometimes get wrapped up in
this I'm not gonna lie so if you want to
eat a big burger and fries and you're
gonna start like hating yourself for
eating it and like getting so mad at
yourself and being so down all day
because you eat a burger and fries
that's not okay that's not healthy for
your mental state that's not good inside
just be like you know what ya ate a
burger yeah I ate fries and it tasted
freakin amazing but I'm not gonna eat
that for every single meal because
that's not my lifestyle I'm not going to
treat my body that way but I know that
that was my one cheat meal second cheat
meal whatever it is gave yourself mercy
pick yourself don't like let yourself
get down for what you eat it's okay to
have a piece of cake it's okay to have a
burger and fries it's okay to go out to
cook out and get a cookout tray because
you know what I did that last weekend
but seriously give yourself a little bit
of mercy it's okay if you break your
diet one day or anything like that like
that's fine you're gonna live you're
gonna survive and your body is going to
be fine and the next one is to listen to
your body so if you feel like you're
literally going to pass out and throw up
while you're working out sit down give
yourself a break
take a lap let yourself breathe and stop
working it out because you need to
listen to your body there's a difference
from wanting to pass out and throwing up
and feeling like you can't do it anymore
and just
like that ii feeling that's when you
push harder the first feeling though you
need to stop and listen to your body and
give your body rest it's fine if you
miss a week of going to the gym because
your body needs rest for example when
you're sick when you have the flu don't
force yourself to work out that isn't
your body telling you I need to rest and
you need to listen to it I just want you
guys to know that some people guys think
it's so wrapped up and like oh my gosh I
need to work out I can't believe I'm
sick like I'm still gonna go to the gym
I'll like walk on the treadmill why well
I just rest give to your body this time
you're sick and you need to do that so
that is something that I feel like it's
totally lost in the lines when people
are trying to get on their fitness
journey they think that they can't miss
a week or they can't skip a week or even
if they get sick they have to keep going
and that's so not true those are my ten
tips and I really hope that you guys
like them because I love to thinking of
these and I really tab used all of these
tips I've been trying to drink more
water I've been cutting out veggies and
I wanted to ask or cutting out veggies
oh no no I've been adding bethi's I also
wanted to ask you guys if you guys
wanted any other of these fitness videos
I guess but I had some ideas like what I
eat in a day grocery haul or fitness
routine or gym routine anything like
that let me know in the comments below
and really hopefully you guys enjoyed
this video I loved loved loved making it

your way to your fitness journey send me
