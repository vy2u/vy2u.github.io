today I'm filming a video in a new
location I feel like all of my videos
have been in super random locations
lately I am currently in Nashville
Tennessee right now and I've never been
to Tennessee in my life before so this
the first time here super excited I'm
here for my little sister's volleyball
tournament because she has won here so
we'll go her team face if you guys live
in Tennessee I would love to know but I
also just got back from LA so if you
missed any of the LA vlogs and want to
see what I've been up to you can follow
my vlog channel and also follow me on
Instagram today I wanted to do a
sit-down talking video because I just
feel like I haven't done one of these
like advice big sister type videos in a
long time and I feel like that is why a
lot of you guys have subscribed to my
channel so if I'm right let me know but
I do think that whenever I do these
videos they do really well and they
actually help so many of you guys which
is why I do them so I just like love
giving you guys advice I love kind of
acting like a big sister role and a way
to a lot of you guys were just a friend
because I know I'm younger than a lot of
my viewers or enlike around the same age
as them we're all like in college
basically I feel like today I wanted to
do a video about kind of talking about
what we as women and as girls deserve
how sometimes our self-confidence is
shaken up or just like completely on the
ground and how we can lift it up what
things we should keep in mind to empower
ourselves and yeah it was also
International Women's Day yesterday so I
thought this was super super fitting and
I just like to make an empowering video
for us girls out there and just to help
you guys because I was on the plane
today and I was reading my old journal
entries because they have a journal app
on my phone and I was reading my old
journal entries on there because I
decided to write once on the plane and I
was like so happy and just so thankful
and it was a very it was like a journal
entry full of gratitude basically just
like how beyond thankful I am to God how
beyond thankful I am for
you guys like just basically a praise
God like my life is good but not in a my
life is so great I have no worries it
was more of like I am so happy right now
and that's not because of a person or
it's not because of a circumstance it's
because of Who I am that's why I'm happy
right now some pointers that I
constantly have to remind myself and I
feel like whenever I kind of go into a
slump or I was reading my old journal
entries and a lot of them were honestly
very very sad because for the most part
I would write in that journal when I was
feeling low or sad it's not really what
I was feeling happy you know I wouldn't
write in it so I was just looking back
and it was just like insane to me at how
I don't even remember feeling that low
and I was so low in my journal entries
like I just like wish that this would
all go away like I have never felt this
depressed in my leg it was just like a
very very eye-opening for me because
even though that was me it felt like a
new person reading it so yeah this intro
is very long but I felt like I need to
say this to a lot of you guys to know
that if you're going through something
like that where you're at your lowest
that you've ever been that it's not
gonna be like that forever you will get
through it and pretty soon you're gonna
look back at that and look back at those
feelings and not even remember that you
had those because you are completely
like a new person you were changed and
I'm looking at my phone because I wrote
down some notes on my phone but yeah
reading those journal entries today
really like I started like tearing up on
the plan I was just in so much shock at
how I couldn't believe that I had gone
from that point to the point I am now
where I'm like over the moon happy and
ecstatic and it's not because of
possessions it's not because of money
it's not because of even like the people
in my life it's literally because I'm
like such a confident person and I don't
even know how I got to this point
because I used to not be like this at
all so the first one is that we deserve
respect
so whether that is from a professor or a
family member
sibling friend or boyfriend that you
need to deserve and demand respect and
this is something that I have always
liked you always know that you know like
yeah I deserve respect whatever but you
really gotta take action with it so if
someone is not respecting you you don't
have to oh that person anything I get if
it's like a professor or a family member
or something you need to show them a
sense of respect because of the position
of power that they're in quote-unquote
but you really don't like if they're
completely bashing you they're putting
you down they're like insulting your
work they're insulting you you don't
need to be nice you can just walk away
or you can distance you from that point
on kind of like separate eyes but I'm
talking about more like in a
professional sense or in a friendship or
a boyfriend if they're not respecting
you you don't have to be nice to them
you don't have to be mean I'm not saying
to insult them back but don't stoop down
to their level but you don't need that
in your life so just if a friend is
constantly like picking on you and
they're constantly making fun of you and
it started to like not be a joke and
they actually though like make plans and
dip to you or they'll borrow your stuff
but never give it back or whatever
whatever it is with they belittle you or
anything like that or put your dreams
down you don't need that like there's no
point in having someone that is just
going to tear you down and make you feel
miserable to stick around so one thing
I've learned because I have had to cut
friendships I've had to cut
relationships I have stood my ground by
like a faux professor has been
disrespectful I have emailed the board
you know like I have done proactive
things to make myself not feel belittled
anymore and it just it's hard because
it's like you have a relationship with
that person but in the long run you
should only have people in your life
that uplift you and that can have want
to the best for you the next thing is
for boys related so this one is for a
lot of girls around my age in high
school and maybe even younger or older I
don't know but if you are trying to date
a guy or you're dating a guy
in relationship they need to respect
your body and that is one thing that is
a touchy subject and it is very like
risky for me to talk about I don't know
but because I don't really talk about
this sort of stuff on my channel but I
just felt like I had to say this because
I've seen so many girls kind of feel
like they have to have sex with a guy in
order for them to like them or they have
to have sex with a guy because they're
dating and that's what they expect or
they have to hook up with a guy and go
further than they want because it's been
X amount of months that they've been
dating and they're just expecting it at
this point and that is such toxic
thinking you do not owe a guy anything
especially with your body that is your
only body and it's your one and only
body you need to treat it right you need
to be kind to it you don't want it to be
used for some for something that you
don't even want like if you are not
ready if you don't want if you want to
wait if you do not want to do something
physical with someone and even if you've
already had a physical experience with
someone and then you don't want to do it
again you don't owe them anything and so
this is something that I really want to
stress because I feel like in high
school especially there's all of that
pressure because everyone's kind of
starting to do it and in college even
more because literally it feels like
everyone does it but you do not have to
I just feel like if a guy and I know
you've probably heard this from like
your youth pastor or your parent or
something like that but like if a guy
can't wait that he's not the one for you
but it is really really really really
true you're the basis of your
relationship especially at such a young
age should not be physical it should
have more like of a deeper connection
and I get that somebody won't want to do
things right away and that's your own
personal preference but what I'm trying
to say is that you are not comfortable
at that moment no one can take that from
you not everyone is doing it even if it
seems like it because I know it
definitely does seem like it but not
everyone has and you it needs who have
someone that respects your body and
respects choices because
if your body it's not theirs so that's
something I want to stress so much I
don't know I could do a whole video on
it but that's just something I feel like
I've seen everywhere it's on TV it's in
movies it's in literally everyday life
and so many girls feel like that's the
way to get a guy to like them and I'm
telling you it it's not another thing is
when guys tell you oh I'm with you
because you're the best Ellen I'm ever
gonna get it where did that way or weird
in other ways like oh you're the best
I'm gonna get like I'm not gonna break
up with you around so nice and romantic
I feel like because why one of my
boyfriend's had told me that and I
remember thinking fullness so sweet like
I'm the best he's ever gonna get like oh
so nice it sounds nice but it's actually
such a horrible backbone to base your
relationship off of it's such a horrible
way to say like that's why I'm with you
like when a guy is telling you that oh
you're the best so that's why I'm with
you not you're the best and I'm with you
because of XY and Z but like if that's
the only reason why it's really not a
good thing because once something better
comes along that means that they'll be
with a better person you know and a
relationship and a lot of those times
when people are saying like you're the
best I'll ever have it's more in terms
of like oh you're the prettiest girl
that's gonna get with me right now
you're the prettiest girl it should
interested me you're the nicest girl
that's ever showed interested me
whatever but what happens someone else
comes along that I am a very common
person in the sense where I'm sure of
myself like if someone doesn't find me
attractive I'm totally fine with that if
someone doesn't like me I'm fine with
that but when it comes to like being
with a guy or just in general II I
understand that there are people out
there that others might find we're
attractive what being confident does not
mean be thinking I'm the prettiest girl
in the world that's not what that means
it means being comfortable with with not
being the prettiest girl in the room and
still being okay with it because it's
all relative to one guy you might be the
prettiest girl in the room to the other
you might not be and looks as such a
relative thing that like looks are so
fleeting like sometimes like curly hair
will be in style and ombre and then I'll
be like so cute and then other times
what if like blonde and like stray hair
and like
to cut around style then what I'm like
cool classifieds ugly what I'm trying to
say is that if a guy tells you that and
he's only with you because of shallow
reasons like that that is not a
compliment you need to run because they
should be able to tell you why they love
you for many reasons besides just oh
you're hot you know like oh no don't
call me that call me like I'm like a
nice person I am a funny person I like I
get you the way that other people won't
get you know like things like that like
I'm confident like you need to say
reasons why other than just the fact
that's like oh well you're the best I'm
gonna get right now because then they
will literally like the next time they
like constantly looking for the best
thing so I am seeking from experience on
this one this looks such a specific
example and it's definitely from
experience but but that isn't one of the
things I just wanted to mention because
I feel like some people think it's like
so sweet and like I know girls right now
that are getting relationships that's
like well he told me that I was the
prettiest girl that he's ever been with
and I'm like I'm sure he told his last
girlfriend that too and then you came
around and then what happens when
someone else comes through and you know
so like it definitely needs to be a more
deeper meaningful relationship something
that you have wonder common with okay
that looks because looks is not gonna
keep a relationship alive obviously you
have to be physically attracted to the
person and I'm not saying go and be
someone that you're not attracted to but
don't have that be the basis of your
relationship the next thing is to not
stand for cheating so this kind of goes
hand handed the last one but listen
ladies we deserve so much better than a
man who was going to get with another
girl while he has us so don't stand for
that another thing that is my biggest
pet peeve is when girls hate the girl
hate the other girl but the guy cheated
with like they like hate her so much and
they go out on her way to like make her
life a living hell and like they but
talk craft all of her friends about her
and like she's label that's like a huge
 and like all of this stuff to the
girl that like
he cheated with when in reality that
girl that he cheated with yeah if she
like may not care about you and maybe
she's not the nicest person you know she
like doesn't really have I don't know
but she's not the moment to commitment
to you she never made a promise to you
to not like hook up with him or anything
like that she doesn't even know you if
it's your best friend totally different
story but if it's just some random girl
that he knows then it's like don't be
mad at her she literally owes you
nothing like even if she knew that he
had a girlfriend she didn't have a
connection with you shouldn't have a
relationship with you like she really
liked it might have been just easier for
her because like she didn't know you so
she didn't feel bad you know he's the
one who literally looks you in the eye
every night and tells you he loves you
and then yeah it's cheating on someone
or he's the one that is making the
promise to you and then going and
texting other girls so if anything you
should be mad at him and break up with
him dump him you deserve better than
that
and not hate the other girl I'm not
saying become friends with her by any
means another thing is that we deserve
to be independent and we deserve to do
what we love and I feel like I need to
crap out this sentence because it's so
important what I mean by this is that I
know so many people that cannot be by
themselves they need to do something
with everyone like a grocery shop with a
partner they need to like get their
nails done with someone they need to go
out to eat with someone they need to
like go work out and go to the gym with
someone like you don't need to do that I
am one of those people that I love going
to the gym with my roommate I love
grocery shopping with my roommate I love
doing all those things with other people
but if they don't want to or they can't
I'm like more than fine going alone like
sometimes I prefer it so just my biggest
thing is like learn to do things by
yourself I challenge you guys to run
errands by yourself this week go out and
do something by yourself this week
because I feel like in college when
we're surrounded by friends especially
we always feel like we have to do
something with them and I see so many
people like that that they feel like
they have to be with someone at all
times but do you want to win whatever
you want to come and like every time
like the other person doesn't for the
library they don't go to the library one
of those things don't be that person
learn to do things on
your own it is so freeing it is honestly
great I just jam out in my car to music
I have my own thoughts I just don't have
to talk to anyone if you guys can't tell
them and extreme introvert but I think
being independent and being by yourself
is such a great thing and we deserve to
do what we love and I feel like you
learn you learn what you love once you
do start doing stuff on your own so I
realized my passion for YouTube but once
I like broke up with my boyfriend and
started like diving headfirst into
YouTube I'm spending so much time into
it and my channel grew and it was great
and I said so much time and energy on it
and honestly I was like the happiest
I've ever been and I'm not saying this
it's like oh I don't need a man like I
have a boyfriend right now and I am so
happy in that relationship and but like
he complements me and we're two
independent people in a relationship if
that makes sense so like it just works
like we both love spending time together
like any chance I free time I have I
will try to go and spend time with him
but I also like doing things on my own
like I need to be by myself I need my me
time I if he can't hang out or if my
roommate can't hang out I'm totally fine
with that
sometimes I'll choose that you know and
you just discover yourself as cheesy as
it is when we throughout the days you
don't need to go on a big like solo hike
by yourself like cross-legged to
Appalachian Trail is like in the movie
wild or something like that like that
you don't need that you just need time
alone every now and then and I think
running errands and stuff it's like the
perfect time to do it so Joe if I some
one next time you want to go and get
lunch eat by yourself like I'm totally
fine with going to a restaurant being
like you had table for one like I'm fine
with that like I'll just like be on my
phone or something I just wanted to do
this especially International Women's
Day inspired me yesterday my flight
inspired me today I was just doing good
mood overall so I hope you guys like
this despite the awkward lighting and
the ugly background I also want to know
if you guys would like me to make some
sort of like self-love self-confidence
thing thing is so like broad but I was
thinking of doing like a calendar or
something like that like for the month
of April and doing like every single day
like a self-love challenge and it would
be a hundred percent free I wouldn't
charge you guys for a you would just
have a downloadable link and then we can
kind of have like a hash tag and you
guys send me pictures and Diaz and stuff
so if you guys think that that would be
a good idea let me know because I really
really want to start that especially
you'd be cool if I could get that out in
April you guys enjoyed this super long
video and I will see you guys next time
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
