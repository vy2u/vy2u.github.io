light though is so good guy shut up
hello
hey guys it's Natalie here and today I'm
here with my best friend grace she has a
blog you guys have seen her in another
video of mine and you probably see her
on a lot of my social medias if you
follow me boys t-shirts but um she has
her own blog it's gracefully made.com
and she's awesome she's been blogging
for a very long time oh yeah we met de
serie we met through social media
grandma but yeah we connected cuz she
goes to Chapel Hill which i'm actually
at chapel hill un seen and she was 30
minutes away virginity of north carolina
which is actually my colleges rival for
me yeah but i'm wearing carolina blue
today just reorder the tailgate i'm also
converting her so i'm sorta but we are
here to give you guys a few tips on how
to start a youtube how to start a blog
because i feel like a lot of you girls
are getting into that and just couldn't
have a lot of questions I know when I
first started YouTube I had a ton of
questions and it was just nice kind of
googling things but it was hard finding
answers to them so we just kind of
wanted to put a youtube and blog thing
in case you're studying both of them
aware one or the other tips into one
video so let's get started so my very
first tip is that your first video
should be something that you want to
film but also something that is kind of
popular because if it is not the what
people are searching for then you won't
get any views and I know a lot of you
guys I then YouTube is not enough it's
not about the subscribers or the views
but it is nice to have people watching
your videos because you want to express
your creativity and you want people to
watch it so I totally get that and you
want people you want to have a video
that people search for but don't just do
a video just because it's popular if you
don't actually like the video make a
video that you would want to see on
someone else's channel okay so as for
starting a blog i would first start with
blogger or wordpress there are both free
websites and um picking a blog name now
that's kind of hard because once you
pick it
you have to stick with it and it's like
forever yours unless I mean changing it
gets kind of hectic but remember that
your blog name should represent you and
be creative you know don't just pick
like sparkles and seashells or you know
just like your favorite things like be
very creative a second tip is something
that you had guys have probably heard so
much but it is be consistent you need to
post consistently if you no one's going
to want to subscribe to someone that has
one video every two months because think
of it when you want to subscribe to
someone like that and especially in the
beginning when you're kind of just
trying to start off I would say post
very very frequently I think two times a
week is good but if you want you can do
it three times a week if you want you
can do it even once a week but try not
to do any less than once a week I know I
have kind of had struggles with that in
the past and right now my last video I
think was a little over a week ago so
that's kind of ironic that I'm saying
that but it's good to find a schedule
and stick with it in the summer it was
so easy for me to fail an upload and I
uploaded so often but now in the school
year I'm kind of trying to find back my
own schedule again to mix with my exams
my school work and my youtube so yeah
just be consistent because no one's
going to want to subscribe to someone
that doesn't ever post videos so the
thing I love about me and Natalie is
like she's YouTube and I'm blogging so
it's kind of different so I'm going to
talk about consistency as well but um I
usually post monday wednesday friday so
consistency is key also for blogging and
um the thing is you want to post at the
exact same time every time you post
because that's what your followers are
expecting and that's what they're
looking for so when they come on your
site they'll know you know they'll come
see that you have new content up that's
actually how you gain your readers you
know third tip is something that I
haven't seen too often on other videos
kind of like this but it is to interact
with your viewers but also interact with
other youtubers and people that are in
kind of your YouTube blogging bubble I
guess I don't like saying bubble but
just do what you do because if you
interact with people's comments on your
videos people will see that and they
will want to comment and its really nice
you don't just want to be talking to a
wall like if I'm
commenting on someone's video it's
really nice when they respond and are
like hey I actually noticed you I saw
that you commented it's not just like
I'm talking and no one's listening so
that's always really nice it's just a
nice character trait honestly and then
also interacting with people that do the
same thing is you is so helpful it is so
supportive or it's so nice to have
supportive friends like grace here she's
one of my most supportive friends and
all my other friends on YouTube my best
friend on YouTube is steph red I will
link her down below too but me and her
are so supportive with each other and
it's not competitive at all and it's
just really nice because if you think
about it you're not losing people who
are watching me if I lead them to her
channel you guys aren't going to stop
watching me to watch her you guys are
just gonna watch both of us and it's so
nice to have someone that understands
what you're doing and also is growing
with you and give me tips and tricks and
just helping you out along the way it's
really nice because a lot of people
especially high school and college and
middle school even don't understand what
YouTube is YouTube is still so small
even though we think it's so big not a
lot of people really get what we do so
it's really nice to have that support
system so a lot of you guys have asked
about how to grow an Instagram audience
and I know Instagram is pretty popular
item for YouTube as well but like
blogging has definitely helped um and my
biggest thing about Instagram is the
quality of pictures other besides timing
timing and quality of pictures because
that's what companies like you know
that's what companies will repost and
that is how you gain your followers so
it's like a walking down a one-way
street you know you got to give some to
get some so like you know like she
mentioned leave comments check out their
blogs interact like I leave comments on
Instagram like oh you know cute sweater
or you know just like show some love to
other bloggers and you'll get some
backing my fourth one it took me a very
very long time to kind of understand and
actually follow through with my own
advice but you need to broadcast your
YouTube on your social medias my youtube
was a secret for so long I don't know
why I don't know why I was in that
mindset of people will think it's weird
and yeah some people do think it's weird
not gonna lie but I should have moved
past it and not care so that was kind of
my own fault but now I'm giving you
advice don't make my mistakes and
broadcast your channel on all of your
social media forums be so proud of your
channel people want to see someone who
in is proud of what they do not like i
do youtube I know it's weird to it ya
know I've to it the and let you do it
because you should be if you are doing
YouTube make sure you're doing it for
the right reasons which if you are then
you should want to broadcast it even
though it is so uncomfortable when
friends from high school or people from
high school make fun of it and think
it's weird because it might happen it
happens to me it's probably happened to
you when you think it's weird and like
you just gotta move past it I feel like
you're reading my mind that's not my
point we like didn't my leg say one
points we were gonna talk exactly so
yeah ok I'm actually just about to focus
on on wait um wait i just want slight
rain this black ok ok she just say um i
think that having different platforms
like i'm going to say the same thing is
her but I an example I have a Facebook
page and a lot of my Facebook friends
will see it on there um I have a Twitter
page I always you know share my link is
it was like different I try to use
different photos though and different
like wording cuz i have like some of the
same followers on everything and you
don't want to see it you know all the
time and so that is a really great way
like if you even want I can you can
email me I can have Natalie put my email
down you've asked me what my social
media like schedule is like for facebook
i do it in the mornings like twitter i
do at night you know stuff like that so
if you are curious about strategic davis
responding to hell she was responding to
so many people that follow her blog
emails this morning and last night and I
was just wow like she wrote she writes
limpy para guys do don't care about what
you know helping people so I mean
hashtag PR journalism major yeah my next
tip is for camera equipment so this I
left at the end because I think it is
the not the least important at all but
your main ones should have been like
your passion and what to film and stuff
like that and so once you get all that
you should have the right camera
equipment but i actually just bought a
new camera this is my first time sewing
on it Oh Gracie's go ahead and pull out
her camera she'll be back got
canon 70d and beautiful yes it's it's
just my baby now it was a mean it took
me about half of my savings but you know
it was worth it it was worth it I do
think you should you know this is
something like you know you want to
pursue like blogging or youtube you
should invent sooner really yeah that's
why I needed one because my camera was
just not cutting it it was very old it
was not good and it was basically the
same quality as the new iphone and
that's when I realized I think I need a
new camera so I invested in this I got
it this weekend I'm so excited is my
first video on this thing so I'm still
playing house like the lighting and
settings and everything so good my lens
Oh areas like good i would recommend
investing in a new camera ask your
parents if they can help you if you
don't have money if it and just say like
this is something you really want to do
you can even pay them back or something
cuz i know they are so expensive in the
average teenager does not have this
amount of money so that's why you kind
of need a build up to it and also maybe
just ask your parents for help if it's
something that you really want to pursue
if you're like in high school or middle
school or something like that but yeah
camera equipment is good i just used
natural lighting to film i've never used
anything else i bought studio lights
from amazon and i haven't used them yet
because I haven't really had to film in
the dark yet but yeah so I have studio
like to but natural lighting is really
the best lighting out there and I don't
have a microphone I just use the camera
microphone um I think it works well I
can edit it in Final Cut Pro I do use
Final Cut Pro i recommend it you can
start off with imovie i start off with
imovie until this summer so you can
definitely use iMovie for a very long
time just get a feel of editing because
instead of kind of getting thrown into
final cut pro you don't want to be
spending like three thousand dollars all
at once so just like build up to it it
will it will have like your videos don't
need to be a hundred I perfect your very
first video but i do recommend having
pretty good quality videos or else when
no one's gonna want to click back on it
I don't know about you Natalie but I
think we're gonna get confused but end
the day like which cameras which like I
might go home day long but I do okay I
actually really like you know camera
equipment so I'm going to show you a
lens that you have to
or not have to but you should get four
videos it's the 18 to 135 that's
actually the laddies yeah that's the one
she's using and it's very good it's a
zoom lens and it's perfect for video as
you can see with this life so much this
one but for blogging I am going to
recommend be even whip it out it's the
50 millimeter it's very popular it's
only a hundred dollars on amazon oh yeah
so it's like it's the cheapest lens but
it's um I will tell you one thing there
is no zoom um but it will capture like
the details and that's what's important
for the blog blogging details and for
youtube I kind of wanted a zoom lens but
mm-hmm so you know we like it depends on
the platform but definitely choose the
lens that you think is most appropriate
for you and my last tip for YouTube is
to make sure that your personality
shines through in your videos I this may
have kind of been touched on on the
other tips but it is so important I
cannot tell you how many times I've
watched YouTube videos and they have
been so fake and I can tell and it's
very kind of we can viewers can tell and
I don't people shouldn't think that you
guys are stupid and that they can't tell
if they really are doing this for the
right reasons because it's very obvious
I know YouTube has a huge trend and I
like doing these videos with like
popular music at first and saturated
film and then intro that's like kind of
cute and shows your personality and then
a video I don't you know if you guys
know what I'm talking out if you watch
youtube videos those typical videos
which I love doing I filmed those too
but the difference is you can tell when
people are doing them are not doing them
because they actually like them they're
just doing them because they're popular
so I would definitely make sure your
personality shines through that is so
important and sorry about ratting oh no
that is just one thing I want to say to
you guys that's so so important
especially as you gain your audience and
people can people sort to relate to you
and start knowing your personality kind
of it's very sad when I see people that
are so not so fake and obviously I could
be wrong they might be in a pillar it
right reasons but it's just what it
comes across so just make sure your
personality shines through four
reasons and super my last or to like
finish up on this I do want to say I've
gotten um emails about asking you know
about getting free product and oh I want
a blog for the money and for the free
stuff well first of all if that's like
your purpose then you know maybe that's
not the right yeah you're not that's not
the right reason to go about um handling
vlogging sigh I didn't start wanting you
know free clothes it's a benefit but um
going that way it's in the long run you
won't get far not your way yeah you
might get far at first and then I think
it's gonna be like whoops and then
you're gonna like you know tumble he hit
a roadblock and downfall yes so if
you're not doing so approach it that
because you you know have a passion for
fashion I can't I just use my so this is
a general video on how to start YouTube
and blogging if you guys have more
specifics we can make this a series um
