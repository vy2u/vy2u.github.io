I am filming a how to get started on
YouTube / how to grow your YouTube
channel video because I have been have
been getting recently a lot more
comments from subscribers and viewers of
mine that have been wondering that how
to start your own YouTube channel any
tips that I have on how to grow a
successful YouTube channel but I really
wish that I had someone like this to
tell me everything I need to know about
YouTube before I started or even during
my journey because I started a long time
ago and I kind of stopped but then
restarted so I just really wish that I
had some of these tips because I
literally had no idea what I was doing
like if you think you were lost
I probably guarantee I was more lost I
was about to say I was lost her but
that's not a word this is gonna be my
video on telling you every single thing
that I know about YouTube and I'm
projecting it to you guys so I really
hope that you guys have like a pen and
paper to jot these notes down because I
am going to be talking a lot about a lot
of different subjects and if you want me
to do any like specific video on one of
these subjects and kind of dissect it a
little more let me know in the comments
below also let me know in the comments
below how you guys have my youtube
channel because I think that'll be cool
you guys can then read the comments on
how to kind of like get found on youtube
so calm down low if this is your first
video or how else you found my youtube
channel and make sure to subscribe if
you're new here but let's just get
started because they were feeling this
is gonna be a long video the first thing
that you need to ask yourself is why do
you want to start youtube and what type
of videos you aren't going to make so I
know this is a very sad thing and I have
said this so many times before but if
the reason that you're starting youtube
is because you want to make it a
full-time job and you want to be famous
it's gonna be really really hard to
continue with it because you're not
gonna do that right away you're probably
not even gonna do that within the first
year or two it's gonna take a lot of
time and if that is what you guys are
like oh my gosh like that sucks I don't
want to do it anymore than you shouldn't
because if you just want to do it
because you want to make it your job or
because you want to get famous or you
want to get paid it's not for you if you
want to do it because you love creating
content you love you're a more creative
person you need to have a creative
outlet and you want to see what comes of
it but you all
just love making videos love talking to
people through the internet I love
anything about YouTube at all then you
should definitely start my tips on how
to kind of like get started on your
videos and stuff is find something that
makes you you so if you want to do more
fashion and lifestyle videos but that's
just not you you're way more into like
cooking let's say but you see that
lifestyle videos are getting a lot more
views do your own thing do cooking and
then you can incorporate anything else
that you want but people like following
people that are unique because no one
wants to watch the same person think of
the people that you guys watch they're
not all the same they each have their
own unique spin on a video or they you
like their personality because of who
they are it's a person not because
they're just like everyone else also if
you want to get started though I would
not make your videos too too specific
because then you might not get views so
I know this is kind of like
contradicting what I just said but it's
not because you still need to make
videos that you love but try in the
beginning at least to make some videos
that are a little more popular so that
people can click on your video the next
is for equipment and editing so a lot of
you guys have been asking me especially
recently what I use to vlog and I use a
canon g7x that is the most popular
camera vlogging camera for youtubers
that I watch at least for a lot of like
that lifestyle Beauty youtubers everyone
has a canon g7x i really really love it
i think it's such an amazing quality for
such a tiny camera which would also be a
great camera if you don't want to invest
in a DSLR great camera to choose from
for my main channel videos - what you're
watching right now I'm shooting on a
Canon 70d it's a DSLR camera it's pretty
pricey I'm just using the kit lens that
it comes with but I also have a 50
millimeter lens that I will do photos in
or videos where I'm a little standing a
little further away because 50
millimetres is means that it's zoomed in
so it makes the background more blurry
and I also have a rode mic attached to
this just so the audio is a little
better but that is my equipment for
vlogging if you're mainly going to do
vlogs I would recommend honestly your
iPhone I think it has great quality
that's what I used to do vlogs on in the
beginning like your iPhone works just
fine for the beginning remaining videos
your iPhone still works but if you want
to produce higher quality I would
definitely recommend going to a library
I know
University at the library I can rent
DSLRs for a week try doing that most
schools do that
going to Ebates buy a cheap one that's
already used until we can save for an
actual like camera that's brand new you
can ask any friends if they have any
Craigslist anything like that because
quality really is important I don't want
to say you can use anything for a video
because yes you can start with using
anything but people stick to videos that
have better quality like if I was just
filming on a MacBook right now had a
crappy audio and was filming a like an
iPhone like this main channel video a
lot of you guys are probably click out
just because it's kind of annoying to
watch low quality things and I'm just
trying to be honest here I wish I could
tell you you could use anything and you
really can but in the beginning I really
would try borrowing someone's camera or
something like that just getting a feel
for a DSLR or the g7x which is a great
camera something like that that has
better quality as for editing goes I use
Final Cut Pro but you definitely do not
need that please don't buy that in the
beginning if you are just starting out
use iMovie I used iMovie for years
before I switched over to Final Cut Pro
I love Final Cut Pro and I definitely
recommend it but if iMovie has so many
of the things Final Cut Pro has that
when once you're starting out and you're
just using it for a little bit just use
iMovie and you will literally learn
everything you can on YouTube but that's
what I did I looked up how to edit a
video in iMovie how to do this on iMovie
also another thing in this category is
that no one's first video is gonna be
perfect so don't worry about it again if
you have like crappy quality or crappy
or quality and you're not it's you're
editing is not pristine and it's not
like a Academy award-winning movie don't
worry because if you continue to strive
for perfection which is good to want to
be a perfectionist but if you continue
to strive for that for your very first
video no one's first video it's great no
one's first video is their best this is
the beautiful thing about YouTube is
that you learn as you grow I mean
literally my first video was so bad my
first few videos were so bad honestly I
loved that backup videos from like last
year and I'm like you you know like it's
just great to keep growing and growing
and growing so if you're continuing to
wait and pushing it off ugh I don't have
the key
oh my audio is not the best rate yeah I
don't have the editing software I need
yet
you're never gonna post so now that you
uploaded your first video now what
biggest tip to new youtubers is the
consistency you have to be consistent
because no one is gonna watch or no one
is gonna subscribe to a channel that
posts one video a month or one video
every few months or a few weeks people
like consistency like for me I found a
posting schedule you don't need to have
a posting schedule
I recommend it because it keeps you
accountable so I post every Tuesday and
Friday shoutout subscribe for new videos
every Tuesday Friday I would recommend
posting once a week at least like the
minimum should be once a week just to
keep your audience engaged to keep them
like knowing like remembering you
because the Internet is quick to forget
people you guys I mean if you're off
really month like not many people are
gonna remember you you know so you have
to be consistent and you have to keep
showing up in people's subscription
boxes or on like YouTube to actually get
people to watch you another thing is to
comment on your favorite youtubers
videos and I am NOT saying this as the
like for like or comment on my new aura
can you check out my channel watch my
new video well I get that as a new
youtuber it's like it's frustrating
because you feel like you're putting in
so much work to edit a video and make a
video and no one's watching it but if
you're commenting on people's videos
like check out my channel like please
check out my new video I just posted a
new video no offense to whoever does
that but it's very annoying and no one's
gonna want to watch it I mean how would
I see those comments I don't respond to
them and I don't watch the videos
because I just think it's like that's
not how you get people to like you maybe
I get it because you're small and you're
wanting to get people to see you because
honestly I'm pretty sure I did that in
the beginning and people literally would
comment and be like STFU you know like
whatever and so then I realize okay
actually it's pretty annoying and I'm
not gonna get any like true subscribers
if you're like subscribed for subscribe
what I recommend is commenting on other
youtubers actual genuine comments like I
love this video I feel like we have
similar channels people will click on
your video or on your profile if you're
commenting actual genuine things but if
you're just like spamming people's
comments people are just gonna find you
annoying but I do think that having your
name in a lot of comments
for YouTube videos people start
recognizing you they'll start clicking
on your video stuff like that is a lot
better another thing is to utilize
social media so social media is a
business tool it when hundred percent is
for any business whether it's YouTube or
a restaurant or a store or anything at
all using social media is so important
so if you are like a lifestyle based
like my channel YouTube channel you can
post like your fashion pictures and just
like everyday life on Instagram like be
personable on your Instagram stories
they're like mini vlogs or snapchat
stories and that's how you kind of like
engage with your audience respond to
your comments on Instagram respond to
your DMS really engage with people on
there like like their pictures
everything like that because people will
find you on social media and then
they'll if they like you're like
Instagram post or something then they'll
probably like your videos and then
they'll click on the link in your file
and do that so I definitely think and
people like you on YouTube they're gonna
want to follow you on Instagram because
they're interested in seeing your daily
life
so I recommend posting on Instagram like
at least twice a week I I post like
seven times a week I post so often on
instagram so follow me I feel like I
know you guys through my Instagram like
I feel like me and my subscribers
connect more through social media
because that's when I'm like responding
to them that's when I'm like seeing
their lives and they're seeing my life
rather than like me on a screen
I guess it's differently for blogs I
feel like I'm connecting to but for
Instagram I just really really feel like
we're like having a conversation another
great thing about social media is that
you can remind your followers when you
post a new video so if someone's there
for like just Instagram and then they
see the new video like they'll probably
be interested and wanting to see that so
I use Instagram stories every time I
post a new video I'm like new vlog new
videos swipe up and/or Lincoln bio or
whatever and it's seriously I can see
how many people like swipe up and it's a
good amount
so definitely Instagram is such a great
way or Twitter to see like to promote
your videos last thing which is what I
feel like so many of you guys probably
want to know is how to make money on
YouTube so now that you started a
YouTube channel
we started posting videos you're using
your Instagram all of that stuff and now
you're like okay how do I get paid
because I know that I can get paid on
YouTube
so YouTube pays into a so I do YouTube
as a job I'm not full time because I am
a college student and I do actually have
a job lined up after college so but in
college my job is YouTube I'm not
looking for a part-time job I want to
focus only on YouTube because that is
what makes me money in college so for me
the two ways I make money arm one
through YouTube ads so every time you
see an ad on this video I get paid a
certain like CPM which is it cost per
thousand and so every thousand views you
have a cost of how much you will get
paid if that makes any sense so I get
paid through ads so the more views I get
on a video the more ads I the more money
I make because it's not about
subscribers because I can have a million
subscribers but if I don't get a view on
a video I'm not gonna make money and the
next way to make money is through brand
deals so if I ever do a sponsored post
it's paid like I am getting money for
that sponsored post it depends on the
company and it depends on like who
you're working with and how many
subscribers we use etc you have that's
gonna depend on how much they pay you
it's not a flat rate look I'm not
charging people a flat rate for brand
deals if you are by yourself you're
managing all the brand deals you're
managing all the emails that are coming
to you you're pitching yourself to
brands I would 100 recommend I 100%
recommend a website called social
Bluebook and it is basically gonna tell
you how much you're worth on all the
social medias so you can use it for
Instagram and you can use it for YouTube
so for that when I was like on my own
and I didn't have a manager which I will
talk about too but when I didn't have a
manager I use social Bluebook to
determine how much I was worth and I
would pitch to brands like ok this is
how much I want to get paid because of
etc it has all of your stats on there
and it just the calculations it has like
a lower end like the minimum that you
should have accept a deal from and then
like the higher end that's like alright
like that's like a very high brand deal
that you're getting so that's what I had
it like it's a great great great great
great website highly recommend
to anyone off of that I just want to say
that when you do first start getting
brand deals and you do start getting
emails from companies wanting to work
with you and paying you be very careful
you don't want to say yes to everyone
because that some people your
subscribers are the first to know when
you're gonna be like selling out or if
you're not genuine or if you're not true
or if they know that you don't actually
use that product they are the first to
pull you out and they are the first to
hit that unsubscribe button and also you
don't want to lose like your
self-respect I guess from doing
something that you really don't believe
in but you're just doing it for money so
be very careful when you take any deals
at all because you really just want to
make sure that it's a company that you
love so even if it's your first one and
you're so excited I remember the first
email I ever got from a company which is
so long ago and I was like with my mom
and it was like hey we have these like
t-shirts that we would love to send you
and pay you for and I literally like my
heart dropped I was so beyond excited
you guys I and at this point I didn't
know you could get paid from YouTube I
thought ads were the only way to get
paid look I didn't even know sponsor
proposed for a thing it was some like
Japanese anime t-shirts and I was like
mom like should I do it but I was like
no like that's great that's not you you
know I was like think of my channel with
me promoting some Japanese anime t-shirt
it's like me you know what I'm saying
you guys would know and I would never do
this so I was like okay nevermind I was
so excited because it was the very first
time I was ever offered money to film a
video and I just was so happy so don't
take anything that comes your way
because I know it's exciting but you
definitely want to be picky when it
comes to brand deals and then the next
thing is like managers so and networks
so networks and having a manager are two
totally different things and I can
literally make a whole video on both of
these but basically I have a manager now
and she approached me so I know a lot of
people have asked that and I don't know
if you can approach like a manager I'm
sure you can just didn't work in my case
and we just talked to how I would be a
good fit to work with her and literally
she's like the coolest person ever
literally love her we just like
connected and I don't know had a great
phone call had a great conversation
everything
like that and basically what a manager
does is they have connections to a lot
of different companies and they will
pitch you to these brands and be like oh
if you're looking for someone to do a
video for whatever it's a college age
student looking to do like a face mask
video she will pitch me she will email
them she will do the contracts she will
negotiate the rates and then she will
come to me and be like hey do you want
to do this also she is not like running
my channel she doesn't tell me what to
post and I can say no to literally any
deal at all so it's really really nice
it's just kind of having someone in them
like someone that is in the industry
helping you out kind of like a modeling
agency except I consider this like for
YouTube so that's I'm gonna run down on
a manager networks though they dive into
your ads so they promise a lot of
benefits and a lot of things I
personally am NOT with the network and I
currently right now do not want to be
with the network because they touch your
ads without really doing much at least
that's been my experience maybe there's
some experiences where they're great but
I personally am NOT with one right now
and I'm not looking for one this video
is getting so so long as it's 20 minutes
long so I really hope that you guys
enjoy the city I hope this was super
super useful if you want me to dive into
any topic more in-depth or anything like
that just let me know but I love you
guys and I really think it's enjoyed
this video I hope that you guys start
your own YouTube channel and if you did
start your own YouTube channel let me
know let me know how it's going if any
of these tips helped and if you have any
tips that I missed calm things down
below but yeah wow I really really
wanted to make this video and just like
tell you guys everything I know
oh so thank you guys so much and I love
you guys bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
