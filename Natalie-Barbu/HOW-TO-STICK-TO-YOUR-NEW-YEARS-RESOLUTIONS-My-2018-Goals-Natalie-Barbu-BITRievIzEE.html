happy new year it is 2018 and I was so
beyond like crazy I cannot even believe
that it's 2018 already and I am so
excited to be starting in a year off
with this video so this is going to be
my new year's resolution slash how to
keep resolutions and actually make them
count New Year's is just a day January
1st it's just another day but even
though it is just a day on a calendar
and you can definitely make this day
count and makes a year count by stating
resolution or seeking a goal and
actually sticking to it because I am a
big believer in New Year's resolutions I
always make them and I tend to stick to
most of them and I am going to give you
guys my tips and tricks on how to stick
with them and how to make actual good
resolutions not just ones that you're
gonna forget in like two weeks so yeah
if you guys like this video please be
sure to subscribe and we are so so so
close to 100,000 so please please please
subscribe if you guys are new here get
your mom to subscribe anyone at all that
I would love to hit 100k by the end of
the month and I think we can do it thank
you guys so much I cannot believe it's
almost a hundred thousand but I'm gonna
do it huge giveaway when we do hit it so
please be sure to do that but besides
that let's just get into the video I'm
going to start off by saying some
typical New Year's resolutions that
people have and ways to stick to that
first one is to work out more I feel
like that is definitely the most common
one gyms are crowded I went to the gym
today and I've never seen that many
people there in my life and I was like
yeah it's definitely January 2nd it's
definitely the new year to stick to your
workout not just go the first week and
then never again and then next year
you're making the same resolution so I
actually made this resolution last year
and I stuck to it and I haven't seen the
biggest difference in my body the way I
feel how active I can I am now and just
like the amount of energy I have it is
unreal so this is definitely a
resolution to keep first way I likely to
stick to it is kind of gonna be maybe a
little controversial but it is too
spend money so I know that's not
something that you guys want to hear but
hear me out if you spend money on a gym
membership or an app that is monthly
payments or something that actually you
are giving money to you are going to be
so much more likely to actually stick to
it because if it's something that you're
not dedicated at all you just kind of
want to start working out but there's
really nothing like you never paid for a
gym you don't all you have is like your
at-home equipment chances are you're
never going to do it
so now good thing is that they have all
these new years deals for gym
memberships to get people in the door so
you can definitely pay for one of those
and if not you can definitely get some
apps that pay my favorite one is the
sweat by kala app I'm still doing it to
this day I've ran through it a couple
times so it's literally the best app
ever so if you want to do that I'll have
it linked up below everything I talked
about but that's definitely the biggest
thing for me is to dedicate yourself to
something and if you're spending money I
feel like you're way more likely going
to stick to it and the next way to stick
to it is to a dedicated a is at a time
so the first week especially if you're
never working out like the last time you
worked out was like a year ago or six
months ago or something crazy like that
or honestly you've never worked out a
day in your life then dedicate only like
twice a week or something like that in
the beginning because if you say I'm
gonna start trying to gym six times a
week you are going to get burnt out so
only do what you can handle so do even
once a week or twice a week in the
beginning and then start building it up
but if you actually set a number to it
and a numbered goal not just I want to
go to the gym and nothing you will stick
to it so much more because it's actually
like you can check it off your list and
the next thing is to get a plan so kind
of like what I was saying the Kaila app
that is my plan that I use and if you've
never been to the jamot and you just go
it's super super intimidating I still
get intimidated at the gym so if you
just have a workout guy telling you what
to do how to do it it's so much easier
you don't have to think at all you just
have to do it and it's definitely way
way way less intimidating if your
resolution is to be healthier then I was
number one recommend is to meal prep so
that is actually
my resolutions is to start eating
healthier so I definitely am not like a
huge junk food eater but I eat out a lot
so my main resolution for the year is to
serve meal prepping so buy all your
vegetables buy all your food on Sundays
spend like two hours a day or two hours
on Sunday doing the meal prep and you're
good for the rest of the week and to
make things easier I would maybe you
start meal prepping just like three
meals a week then bump it up to five
just incrementally so you don't go crazy
but definitely definitely definitely
meal prepping is some way to be so much
healthier
also to empty out your fridge so when I
go back to school in a week I am going
to empty out my fridge and empty out my
pantry and get rid of any junk food at
all and get it out of your pantry and
your fridge so donate it give it to
someone whatever it is throw it away but
get rid of it because if you have
cupcakes and a bunch of like tortilla
chips and potato chips and like ice
cream in your fridge and in your freezer
it's gonna be a lot harder to resist if
your resolution is like mine and it is
to save money then the number one thing
I would say is to make a budget so this
is actually what I will be doing if you
guys have any apps that you'd recommend
let me know but I am going to start
downloading some apps and making a
budget sitting down spending like two
hours today and just writing down the
money I have the money I normally get in
monthly since I do YouTube as a job it's
a little like fluctuating but I am going
to make a budget and yeah that's gonna
happen so let me know any apps that you
guys have that you recommend the next is
to also let your friends know that you
are trying to save money and this one
you guys are probably gonna be like why
typically at least for my case I go out
to eat with my friends I'm in college so
I'm like constantly surrounded by
friends so I typically if like one of my
friends it's like if you want to go out
to eat you want to go get a coffee
whatever I have a very hard time saying
no so I am going to start letting my
friends know trying to spend money or
trying to save money and trying to not
eat out as much so let's like cook as a
room together let's cook it's like a
little friends meal together so try to
convince them also to save money and no
one's gonna
and be like oh no I'm actually trying to
spend money like everyone is still
trying to save money so if you let your
friends know it's a lot easier to budget
together and another thing that I will
be doing is I'm gonna be seeing a
week-by-week how much I spend so instead
of in the beginning doing it by month
because at the end of January I don't
want to have like a huge slip I'm gonna
start trying to monitor my bank account
week by week and paying my credit card
payments off week by week instead of
just at the end of the month so it's a
lot smaller of a budget that I have to
keep and then later on I'll go to the
whole monthly thing and if your
resolution is to be more positive the
number one thing I would do is to write
down things that make you happy this
sounds so beyond cheesy I know you guys
I know I'm super cheesy but if you write
down things that make you happy when you
are feeling a little more negative or in
a slump you can look at that list and do
those things the next one is to surround
yourself with positive people so this is
also another kind of obvious one but you
would be surprised at how often it is
and how easy it is to surround yourself
with negative people and then constantly
have a circle of like complainers around
you like I have had people in my life
that I have needed to distance myself
from because the only thing they do is
either gossip about people or they
complain about their lives or they make
like jokes about themselves like
negative jokes about themselves so you
feel like you have to start making a
negative joke about yourselves just like
a constant circle of negativity so if
you get rid of those people and trust me
you will not regret it because you
should not have negative people in your
life then you will be have a way more
positive life another tip that I have is
to wake up a little earlier and some of
you guys are probably like that would
actually make me more depressed because
I hate waking up early but you will get
used to it and you are going to feel so
much more productive which will make you
feel positive and in the mornings when
you wake up you can do some stretches
you can start working out you can read
your Bible more if that's something that
you've been meaning to do so if you wake
up a little earlier and use that time to
do something that you typically don't
have time for during the day it will
make you just have a happier day in
general trust me you guys I swear by
this if I wake up late I
have a bad day so waking up a little
earlier even if it's like thirty minutes
to an hour earlier each day trust me it
will help you and the last resolution I
will be talking about is if your
resolution is to focus on yourself more
which i think is such a great one to
have my number one tip would probably be
to turn your phone off for like an hour
a day and I know seriously I don't know
what I would do without my phone either
but it's just to be able to focus on
your life focus on your day be more
present in the moment when you're with
friends and family and trust me when
you're not looking on Instagram and
Twitter and YouTube and snapchat all of
these things and texting people you will
just be able to completely clear your
head and focus on yourself I think that
is such a great way to do it because we
can't do be doing that we're focusing on
the other people when we're scrolling
down Instagram and seeing everyone
else's lives like shut it off for an
hour and just live your own life without
any distractions and it will make a
difference and the next one is to
journal and again I am NOT a big
journaler but I definitely have for like
years and years probably since like
beginning of high school have kept a
journal that I periodically write in and
it is so incredibly nice to look back on
it and see where you were a year ago see
where you were four years ago five years
ago and just little blurbs about your
life like what you were doing how you
feel in this specific moment journaling
that even like one lion a day is
something so so important and definitely
it's cool looking back on so even if you
can't do it every day like I 1,000,000%
do not do it every day but I try to do
it whenever I'm just kind of looking by
myself or alone or thinking about
something or in a weird mood or in a
happy mood so having a journal on hand
like in your desk that you can just
write a little blurb about is definitely
something that I think will help you
focus more on yourself and now I want to
tell you guys my resolutions because I
love doing this and I feel like if I'm
putting it out on the internet I'm like
sending it out there it's there like you
guys can hold me accountable for my
resolutions so here they are the first
one is to make a budget like
so I definitely need help on that like I
have realized I spend way too much money
and it's mainly on going out to eat so
I'm going to start meal prepping that's
actually my second resolution but I'm
gonna meal prep and I'm gonna try to
spend less money on things and like less
money on food and more money on
experiences so obviously I'm gonna have
to try to save over all but I want to
save my money so I can spend it on
experiences like traveling and seeing
new places and yeah just stuff like that
so I don't want to buy clothes I don't
want to buy food besides the grocery
shopping obviously and I want to spend
my money on plane tickets and Airbnb s
and hostels and traveling because I want
to go somewhere new this year that's a
resolution of mine is to travel
somewhere that I have never been to this
year you guys have any recommendations
of where I should travel and when I get
my last summer off which is so weird but
my graduation trip or something where
you guys live I don't know let me know
where I should travel and I definitely
am gonna start planning that soon in the
next one and last one is to reach a
hundred and fifty thousand subscribers
which that number sounds so large and
that'd be awesome if we could reach more
but 150 is like my main goal so if we
can reach 150 subscribers by 150
thousand subscribers by the end of 2018
I will be so beyond happy I'm already
like cannot believe we're hitting 100k
like it makes me smile so I'm thinking
about it I cannot wait so thank you guys
so much because obviously I would not be
here without you guys I would not be
able to have the experience as I do
without you guys I would not have been
able to have it the best 2017 and the
best year yet without you guys so thank
you for granting me all of these
opportunities and just reading your
comments makes my day and I know that
sounds super cheesy and it might not
sound real whatever but like it is trust
me you guys like if I am doing anything
like I check the comments of my youtube
channel more than I checked my own
Instagram and like Twitter and all of
that stuff so really means a lot to me
so please don't be a ghost viewer and
comment down below your resolutions
because if you put it out there on the
Internet it's there and we can he'll
keep you accountable for it it's written
you see it it's basically tangible it
feels like
so you guys will be able to do it I hope
these tips helped you at all in the
slightest and I would love to know your
your resolutions because I just love
like knowing more about them and maybe I
can implement one on my own like if they
like it so definitely do that subscribe
of course I feel like a broken record
but I'm just really happy I'm gonna good
mood 2018 is gonna be great I can feel
it and love you guys so much thanks for
watching hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
