because it is about my hair and you guys
literally every single video you guys
ask me about my hair regardless of if
it's straight or curly and I figured
since I was going to show you my hair
today I should do age drinking hair
video so I am doing a straightening hair
video and it's not just like simple like
seriously she's doing a straightening
hair video people really need a video
for that like I'm kind of just showing
you the products I use I think that's
what much you guys are curious of the
products I use the straightener I use on
the way I straighten my hair like if I
do half-and-half or whatever you know I
don't know um my the way I do it I
literally do it in under five minutes I
did this look I fast forwarded some of
it and I kind of took a little bit out
of it so it is edited so it's not only a
minute and 30 seconds like it says it is
because obviously it's like fast
forwarded a little bit of clips are cut
out so you don't just see me like
sitting there doing my hair but um I
measure it on my foot where I've looked
at the time on my phone and it took me
so I've um I think it was like six
minutes so most of them only takes me
five but you know I had to like make
sure I was in the frame at all times I
kind of like to show you guys help doing
it so that was my phone sorry um but it
is my birthday so I'm getting a ton of
like birthday messages on Facebook but
yeah and also I just wanted to let you
guys know which straightener I'm using
and kind of like you guys know some
things about that is the Jose Eber
Signature Series it's a part of the
Cygnus Signature Series it's a titanium
turbo world's fastest curling iron so
long styling in less than five seconds
and audience this is what the box and it
looks like so I thought this is a male
um obviously it doesn't do your hair in
five seconds like that's a given and
that's not what I'm trying to say it's
saying that I seats up in five seconds
which is also I get my hair definitely
fast because normally it was like my Qi
iron Qi flat iron it's a good flat iron
but it kind of damages my hair and this
one hasn't been damaged in my hair been
using it for a while now but hasn't been
damaging my hair and also it heats up in
five seconds to 450 degrees so I will
show you that it is completely off so
here's proof that it is off its off so
now I'm turning it I'm gonna turn the
little thing to 450 and when it stops
blinking that's when it's 150 degrees
I did not fast forward this this is 150
degrees right now so that's what I
really like about the shaker is that it
make sure you shiny my hair is shiny
right now also leaves I use Moroccan oil
and I will show you all the products in
the video but that's also one reason why
it's shiny but it does make your hair
shinier and it also this I'm gonna read
the back right now because they're the
silver nano technology it ensures that
your hair iron stays bacteria free and
naturally clean so I guess it kind of
just like doesn't have any bacteria on
it I don't know I have been loving this
Jose Eber if you guys don't have me
insist the celebrity stylist is in
Beverly Hills located I have a ton of
his products already I have two others
curling wants and I have already made
two videos with them and it was truly
like it wasn't sponsored or anything
I've liked him for a while I will link
doesn't it down bar below if you want to
check them out I mean you guys just want
to see that the way I could grow my hair
with glowing irons because I have this
growing areas um a straightener now but
yeah I have been really loving it and
the products I use especially like that
joy to think that I'll not to show you
it is the best product I've ever used in
my life it gives my hair no split ends I
will show you the ends of my I don't
have any split ends um yeah
but initially my hair quite a lot and I
curl my hair quite a lot but yeah I
don't really have any split ends and I
really hope that you guys enjoy this
video and I also I got a new camera and
pace you guys can tell so excited but
yeah this is what the curling or those
straightener looks like and also I have
a discount for the Jose Eber site if you
would like I am going to play um put it
on a little title screen right after
this intro and at the end of the video
and in the bottom bar below just so that
you guys can check out its products and
all that stuff if you guys wanted to do
this video please let me know what you
think and next video will be like what
products I use in my everyday here
because you guys have no idea how many
questions like I asked that in my tumblr
and my comments messages in boxes so
many comments so I will let you guys
know
think about that later on and yeah peace
out city light to the water visitor snow
forgets the sky and staring at the
bridge is just like every other night
we've been right when I get out of the
shower I use this Aussie hair insurance
leave-in conditioner just to make sure
that my hair is really soft and smooth
and then after that still wood while my
hair is wet I use this joy Khosla dead
mender and it is awesome and then as my
heat protectant I usually straight sexy
hair smooth and protects heat protectant
and after I straightened my hair I use
Moroccan oil to keep it really shiny and
soft and the straightener I am using is
the Jose Eber titanium turbo
straightener screamin for an answer
darkness blinds me now not surviving
misery
for the Sylvan love to get started I
straighten the very top layer of my hair
first
I feel like this works best and then I
clip what I already straighten and start
straightening the bottom part which
always happens to be the curliest and
also I'm grabbing pieces from the back
of my head all along because I don't
want the back of my head to be curly and
I'm straightening the very bottom layer
but without clipping it just because I
feel like it's a lot faster and it works
just as well that way then I go to the
other side and I use the same exact
technique by starting with the top layer
and I'm straightening the back of my
head as well and then I clip it again
and as you can tell it's very curly
underneath so I just straighten that
really quickly and I straighten the
bottom while I'm running my fingers
through it just to make sure it's really
smooth and it works out perfectly and
super fast next I take Moroccan oil and
I just pump that and put it throughout
my hair but I do not put it at the top
of my head because that was really
greasy so just put it at the end you're
all done so thank you guys for watching
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
