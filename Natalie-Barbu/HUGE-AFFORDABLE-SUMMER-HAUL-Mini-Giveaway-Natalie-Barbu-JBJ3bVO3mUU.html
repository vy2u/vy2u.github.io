am filming a huge summer haul for you
guys I am so excited a ton of stuff that
I've compiled over the past few weeks
and I kind of went on a shopping spree
when I got to LA and if you haven't
known this is my LA place I am living in
Los Angeles for this summer and I'm so
excited to film like so many videos for
you guys so I'm it's down below the
videos that you guys want to see this
summer so you guys can help me out but I
thought it was appropriate to start with
a haul because I haven't done a haul in
so long and I am so excited to do it all
so I have a giveaway at the end of this
video
so stay tuned for that that's gonna hop
right into the hall and show you guys my
summer my summer faves I feel like I
haven't done at home so long that I
don't even know like how to sit and talk
to you guys anymore I'm gonna like lower
the camera a little bit
maybe a little better I don't know okay
we're going with it waiting to start
with this random bag and I will tell you
guys where I got everything some things
are from brandy some things are windsor
some things are el-ad but they're all
randomized so I'm just gonna tell you
guys each article of clothing where it's
from sorry I don't have my life in order
so this video is just kind of gonna be
random starting out from LF I got these
super cute jeans I'm obsessed with them
I think they're so cool and LFT is super
super expensive but when you find things
on sale it's so cheap and like so worth
it these jeans were $28 only and they
are so unbelievably comfortable it's
super super wrinkly because I haven't
seemed it yet but it's this tied shirt
from Windsor I love it I think it's so
cute for the summer to wear with a
little bralette and then the sleeves are
like big bell sleeves with a bunch of
like embroidered details on them and
then the next stop is also from Windsor
and it's kind of similar so it's another
white top this one has more of a v-neck
it's not tied but it's a bodysuit
actually so not a topic nor that his
sleeves are just super big and wide
I love it I think it's so cute and I
love the fact that it's a bodysuit so
that it looks tucked in even when it's
not also I just want to let you guys
know that you can shop all of these or
most of these outfits in my dope profile
so I'm gonna have that link down below
or you can shop everything so be sure to
do that and be sure to follow me on dota
2 because it's such an amazing app this
video is not sponsored but I just love
the app so much and the next thing I got
from Windsor is this super cool denim
jacket I think it's adorable
it's just a distress like oversized
denim jacket and it's ripped and it has
a bunch of pearls on it and pearls are
so cute now and they're so in and I just
really really really love it I think
it's super super cool and I can't wait
to wear this with like just a dress
throw it on over and you basically have
like an accessory instead of a jacket
I'm obsessed are they and the next thing
I got from lft again we're hopping
backwards are these jeans I got two
pairs of jeans there these are just
black and they're distressed and again
they were only $28 which is crazy to me
so yeah I'm obsessed as LF jeans I just
really really really like it laughs I
think it's such a good place to find
trendy items that you won't find
anywhere else except the good thing
about it is that the outlet at least is
so cheap so nothing there's like over
$30 which is amazing if you ever buy
Ella full price do not recommend don't
buy full price they always have sales
they have an outlet that's available
24/7 which like basically is the same
stuff and it's way cheaper like these
jeans were originally two hundred and
thirty-eight dollars
and yeah right what I have paid that
much but twenty-eight dollars okay yeah
and the next thing from LS that I got is
this super cool skirt so it's this denim
skirt with flames at the bottom I think
this is so freakin cool I love it also
what's really cool about it is that
there's no like belt buckle section it's
just a zipper so it's basically like a
cut off skirt except it's cut off at the
top of it and the next thing is this
cute basic tank top so I just got this
basic tank from brandy it has a couple
buttons in the front but it's just black
crop I love a good basic tank I
think it's like crucial to have in your
wardrobe and nothing special but that's
why I'm obsessed with brandy because I
am so into the minimal outfits these
days like my shirt right now it's just
like a white high neck like I just
really really like basic pieces that you
can layer or that you can like dress up
or down so the next thing I got is from
Bloomingdale's and it's this really
really funny shirt so it says my
overpriced authentic stained super worn
in vintage band t-shirt and then it says
consider consider buying one you'll look
really cool and I think it's so funny
because I am such a sucker for like
vintage band t-shirts like I have a
Rolling Stones t-shirt that has like
little holes in it and looks like it's
like 30 years old and I don't listen to
Rolling Stones
and I got on a brandy melville so I'm
such a poser the next thing is from
Windsor again and it is this cute summer
dress
it's another basic dress but I love it
it's a thicker material which I really
really like and it has buttons all down
the side which just gives it a cute
little detail and again you can shop all
of these things on my dope profile so be
sure to check that out I'm so sorry if
I'm being annoying I just like really
really love it and I want to get more
into it so do that and the next thing I
got from Windsor is just this cropped
tee so it's really really cute it's
super cropped though I kind of wish it
was a little less cropped because I
don't know what I'll wear it with but I
feel like this is also something you
like workout in I don't know but and the
next thing from Windsor is this dress so
it is this MIDI dress it's super cute
it's off the shoulder and has like one
giant big ruffle and it's so wrinkly you
guys I'm so sorry it's literally been in
this bag for like two weeks now this is
off the shoulder dress and it cinches up
the waist and it just goes down and it
has like different layers or not
different layers with different like
levels it's like a high-low MIDI dress I
think it is so adorable and perfect for
the summertime and the next dress is
this tight body con it's from Windsor as
well I actually wore this on Melrose and
got some pictures in it so I'll insert
those here yeah I really love it it
looks super tiny but it stretches out a
ton like this is literally this
of my thigh but somehow my whole body
fits into it has this like off the
shoulder kind of like belt detail or
good that goes around your arm and then
it has this really cute belt on it it's
so confusing showing you guys but hope
you guys could see from the photo and
then another thing I got from Windsor is
this a Los Angeles shirt I thought I was
appropriate since I am living in LA this
summer and I actually already wore this
to my first Dodgers game my first and
probably only Dodgers game because I
really don't care about baseball I just
went because I was like that's an LA
thing to do and the next thing I got is
from Brandi and it's again another just
basic tank I really really love Brandis
tanks so this is just a white a white
one and it goes straight across which I
love that cut and the next thing is from
brandy melville and it is this kind of
baseball tee it's cropped but I really
like it and if you guys don't know in a
way I feel like it's like perfect
weather but it gets cold at night which
like it's not like where I'm from in
North Carolina the winter seasons aren't
cold but they're cold like morning and
night the summer is super hot and it's
hot like in the day and at night in LA
it's just like 75 degrees all day and
then it dips to like 60 at night and to
me that's like freezing so I need a
jacket so that's why I'm buying long
sleeves in the winter time because in LA
you can wear this all day and not sweat
so hopefully it gets warmer because I'm
one of those people that yes it's
perfect weather like for the winter but
when it's summer I want it to be really
hot so the next store that I shopped at
is Topshop and I got these shorts they
were on sale I think they're super super
cute so they just have like embroidered
flowers on it and this says love me
across it I thought that was so cute so
I really like them and they're cut off
which is really cute and they just fit
really really nicely like I love
embroidered denim and just denim in
general so it was like I have to have
these and they were on sale and the next
thing I got is a leather jacket because
believe it or not guys I love wearing
black but I don't own a black leather
jacket I had one and I swear it grew
legs and walked away because I don't
know where it went in the past like a
year so I got this denim jacket from
Topshop it was also on sale so I just
thought this almost cool because it was
distressed so it looked a little cooler
and it wasn't
like arm and a leg to buy it so that's
always nice and the next thing I got
from brandy melville I am so sorry this
hall is all over the place I got this
t-shirt from there I love it it says 84
USA it's just a really cute vintage
looking t-shirt and it feels soft and
it's like a little bit oversized and
looser
so I really like it it's like a boxy fit
and the next thing that I got from
brandy is this tank again it's like a
basic black one except it says Los
Angeles on it which I thought was really
really cute and fitting since I'm here
so it says Los Angeles California in
1984 and now for accessories from
Windsor the rest of this is gonna be
from winds are you guys I got this belt
I have been wanting one of these like
western style belts for so long and I'm
so happy Windsor had one and it was
really really cheap love it I think it's
so freakin cute and last but not least I
got these supercool shoes from Windsor
I'm obsessed with them they're just
white boots and they're so cool like I
don't know what I'm gonna wear this with
there it goes I don't know what I'll
wear these with but I just I'm obsessed
with them so and I'm gonna be doing a
