am filming a huge bikini haul and I've
seen these everywhere on YouTube so I
wanted to do one for myself
to give you guys my own personal
opinions on these bikinis the different
quality they're not what I think about
them how they fit on me and then you
guys can actually see them and compare
them to the picture if you have any of
our Channel please be sure to subscribe
I love it if you guys stick around Isis
videos every Tuesdays and Fridays
all these bikinis are from zappos.com
which a lot of people have asked me
questions about because I have some
videos with them in the past I don't
have one of those websites where it's
kind of like hit or miss but you don't
know really know what you're getting so
I have tried them all on and I will have
all the links down below so you can like
compare and contrast to the picture see
if it looks similar I'll tell you my
personal opinion on them yes they did
send me these so I want you guys to know
that but I'm giving my own review on
them and you guys will literally see
them on me so you guys can tell like if
I'm like oh my god it's the best quality
and it looks like crap cause when you're
going to be like um so I'm really
telling you guys my honest opinion I
promise you I know that a lot of people
who are like well they send the best
bikinis to youtubers I don't think so
two of my rates have actually purchased
a whole look with their own money they
got it they shipped it to themselves
whatever and they like the bikinis so I
sort of put that out there I have people
that have actually bought from Snapple
that are not influencers at all and they
say that they like them but out further
ado let's get into the video so the
first bikini is this patterned one this
one is actually I did not expect to like
it as much my side and I didn't really
like the pattern right here like I don't
know I just didn't think it looks like
that cute but on me I really really
loved it I was also really confused
because the back it has these strings
that hang down with the back you look
completely backless like it kind of
looks like the top of about to fall off
it just really really snug though so it
didn't feel loose like I wasn't going to
with a boob that fell out or anything
like that and the bottoms are the same
pattern and they're just normal stretchy
bottoms they are not cheeky and I like
more cheeky bottoms but these
fine they're pretty full coverage on the
bottom and they have like the same
pattern which I like the next naming to
do is very different and I drove home
how I feel about it I got it because I
really want to try it highway since
bikini because I never really felt like
I would wear enough to actually purchase
it on my own
they cook a tank top which is literally
like I'm going to wear this with a tank
top but I'm not going to wear as a
bikini I'm going to wear it as a shirt
this shirt I want to say was strike and
it's kind of a husband upgrading their
back top and then the bottoms are so
high waisted and so full coverage but I
felt like I was literally both in the
nineteen fifties wearing this because it
would mean you barely showed anything
and it was just super full coverage so
these are the orange bottom they're very
high waisted they are stretchy and they
are comfortable and they are pretty full
coverage in the back which if you like
that and this is definitely amazing
super you because it is good quality I
just would not wear it to the beach
myself but I will definitely be wearing
this as a shirt we have this little cute
crop top this next baby suit was
actually my favorite one I think so it
would so be uncomfortable I wanted to
sleep in it you guys like it is so comfy
so innocent orange kind of like a sports
prom looking top and it has seamless
which I love and then the inside is the
same material in the same color as the
outside so I think that makes it just
look so much nicer and it's just so
beautiful and then the bottom are cheeky
and they're the same color and still
seamless and they're just so freakin
cute and so perfectly structured fatal
some of the bathing suits I got really
hugged at my hips and like made kind of
like some skins fall out of it you know
like kind of go over the bathing suit
which I really hate no matter how small
you are that will happen if they are too
tight so I really like that these were
like extremely stretchy and is ganon
it's not seamless so or it's seamless so
it was so so comfortable you guys I that
was by far my favorite and I think the
quality was amazing like it felt like I
paid a lot of money for that bikini the
next one is one of the bottoms I was
talking about that I just had no stretch
and I just could not wear it so I didn't
even
on camera way too small on me um yeah so
wait I don't know if there's just like
barely any stretch but this looks so
tiny it's like a light pink it's really
cute so maybe I got a bigger size of it
it's pick me and then I the top though I
really really like and I'm going to mix
and match this top with like black
bottoms or white bottoms so it's a very
light light pink top it's also a
high-neck and it has the crisscross
laces in the front and then it's an open
back which I thought was gorgeous so I
love the top the top is also really
really great quality just the bottoms
we're way too small also I'm guys wanna
know my size I am a 32a on the top I
have no boobs I think I'm actually
smaller than a 32 egg but like that's
like the smallest size that they carry
at stores so if I wear bras up so I wear
and then I am a 24 or a zero on pant
sizes and I am NOT very curvy so yeah if
you guys are my thighs I were effect
small and all of these I just ordered a
small but yeah that's just for reference
the next one was another one of my
absolute favorite so I'm obsessed with
this mustard color I think it's so so
pretty I really love how again it was
seamless and it has it the same color in
the front and the back it also made my
boots look a little bigger because it
was so like widespread the top and then
pretty tight and then it's kind of like
a tank top so it's just like it doesn't
cross or anything like that it's just
like connect in the back next one is a
one-piece and it says Rose a all day I
know that you guys have definitely seen
this before so I really like this like
let me just for bikinis and seven feel
like having like graphics stuff on it
like saying something is really really
cute but I didn't really like the way to
fit me um I thought it fit fine but I
didn't like the style I think that's
more like it like it's good quality it's
big fine it doesn't like hug at the
wrong places it's very full coverage and
I didn't like that but I would wear this
as a leotard so I would wear this with
like denim shorts and like have this be
the top because I think that would be
really cute but I just didn't like
helpful coverage it was
I don't know that's just my personal
preference but if you guys like that
then it's definitely much good quality
next one was another really really cute
one so it is this emerald green color
which I love because I think the bikinis
and really bright and vibrant and I
really like the ones that are more
subtle so this one's kind of like an
emerald green and gets not really
emerald many more like teal and I love
the straps so the straps are crisscross
in the back kind of they connect in the
middle and they're all these like
braided material I think it's really
really really pretty and I think it also
makes it look more expensive and then
the bottoms are the same and they're
seamless again which I like as you can
tell I don't know if you see a pattern
but I basically like all the people as
one if they have the braided straps on
the hips and then they're pretty cheeky
and they're pretty stretchy this next
one I thought was super cute and
different so the bottom I loved and they
are these kind of like cheetah print ish
but pink and purple they come look like
bruisers honestly actually not that
shaky but like not that full coverage
either I think would really clearly like
the bottom they were super comfortable
and they weren't too tight and at the
top though I like but it didn't fit that
nicely so that's my only complaint about
it this one you can definitely tell was
not made as well as the other ones so it
has this word sunchaser on it so I
thought that was really cute but the arm
holes are way too small like they
pinched at my armpits like I feel like
there's like slick skin like coming out
of I don't know I just didn't like it
was a way to tie it I couldn't lift my
arms without getting a rash basically so
that one I was not that impressed when I
got it was cute but like the way it was
made was not that great this next one I
was really excited about and I ended up
being kind of disappointed so it was
just kind of like athletic looking
bikini so it's white at the top and I
had black around it and it's like this
stretchy material it feels like I don't
know how to describe it but like this
stretchy material
a great great description then connected
in the back but this is just way too
loose at the top maybe it's just because
I don't fill it out but I don't know I
just think really weird it was kind of
like felt very big and baggy on the top
the bottoms were really cute so and I
can definitely use these for other
bathing suits because they're just black
and white bottom and I have like them on
the band it really did like the bottom
at the top I just like didn't like how
it fit this next one I know I said the
orange orange one with my favorite but I
actually think this one is so it is
beautiful I think this is the most
beautiful bikini I've ever seen so it is
this off the shoulder like patterned
criss cross in the front bikini and it
also has strings where you tie it around
your waist I think that this is like the
most gorgeous bikini ever it's just
beautiful I'm in love with it when I
first bought it I was so highly
impressed and then the bottom literally
look like a frickin song like oh my
they're so tiny please hit me in so it's
fine they're just really really really
small and then the hips are just like a
little tiny string so this one is
definitely a little more mistaken finish
on the bottom but it difficult and I
thought it was so gorgeous this exon was
another one that was great
so it is this gray bikini and I don't
like it I've seen it one forties but
more expensive being sold at other
stores I don't really know that exact
brand but it is just basically sound
like a triangle top but it's not it's a
neoprene material it's just like a
normal triangle bikini and then it has
its like a tank top again we're just
connects in the back but it's just like
sits on your shoulders it's not
criss-cross or anything like that and
then the bottoms were so pretty I love
them I love they went a little higher up
and they were pretty cheeky and again I
really like to thin hips I think it just
makes it look a lot better and it is
more flattering on my bodies and Exxon
is a one page in an SS mustard at yellow
one piece um this one I thought was okay
it would really really high up on my
hips so I have mega
tan line I don't like the way it was
made as much it is comfortable and it's
not bad quality but I just don't like
the strap
I don't know I feel like it would have
been better if it was seamless and it's
not so that's why I didn't like it as
much but it's not that quality and it
fits fine I just think that the other
ones are better and the last thing is
that I have is this black one and I
thought that I was going to love it I
would so it's French for this so it is
this one piece and it's black and it has
like fans in spaghetti strap and it's
like completely backless a sort of super
low back and I'm never going to be we're
able to wear this again because my
nipple was about to pop out like it gave
me a mega-size boob and I don't have
sides and it felt was like the straps
gonna constantly fall off the whole time
so I don't know if I just like it de
staël because it bit me or if it's like
too skimpy that I feel personally
uncomfortable I don't know it's just a
tub too low too late it was just not
flattering at all citizens simply a know
for me that was it's providing bikini
try on haul I hope that you guys liked
it and leave any comments below on what
your favorite one was and I know that a
lot of people have mixed reviews out
samples but I promise you all of these
the shipping did take a while because it
is coming from China that's expected but
all my friends that have shoppers baffle
which I think it's like two of them
about bikinis and I know one of my
elders has got clothes from there and
she liked it and they've all liked it so
I personally don't think that they send
anything specific to youtubers I know
that there are other stories otherwise
so I am sorry about that but this is
just my personal opinion on them and I'm
also basing it off of my previous like
my friends opinions that have shops with
them before so I hope that kind of like
clears anything up for you guys I just
want to be like fully honest with you in
videos because I don't like when
youtubers kind of like are shady and
high things but I hope you guys like
this video let me know what your
favorite one ones
and yeah hope you guys are excited for
coming by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
