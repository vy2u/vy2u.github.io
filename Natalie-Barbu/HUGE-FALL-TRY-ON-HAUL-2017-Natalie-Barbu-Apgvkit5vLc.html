am finally filming a full haul for you
guys so every season I like to film
hauls or maybe multiple times a season
depending on how much I shop for fall
it's one of my favorites because you're
kind of transitioning into the warmer
Chloe the colder glows and you're just
kind of tired on the heat and it's
really nice to just be able to wear cozy
sweaters and boots and like cute jeans
and I don't know let me know if you guys
are excited for fall because even though
I love love love the heat and I love
summer I'm still like really really
excited to have pull out with sweaters
and it's still 85 degrees where I live I
live in North Carolina so I'm kind of
just like staring at these clothes and
not yet wearing them but that will
change hopefully soon if you guys are
new here please be sure to subscribe to
my channel I post videos every Tuesday
and Friday if you guys are watching this
early happy Tuesday and if you're not
let me know what brought you to my
channel I would really love to know
because I'm always super curious how you
found my channel if you're already a
subscriber or if you're a new subscriber
and without further ado I'm just gonna
get into the home okay so the first
store that I'm gonna show is Abercrombie
&amp;amp; Fitch and if you just don't know
Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch was like the big
thing in middle school I feel like and
then people just kind of stop shopping
there I personally still love
Abercrombie I think they have super cute
things so the first thing that I got is
this big knit sweater and I love knit
sweaters it's just a cute little beige
color I got it in a size large because I
like to wear my sweaters oversized and I
think this would be super cute with some
denim and booties or some leggings and
like knee-high boots or something like
that so it's super super soft it was
really really cheap actually was on sale
which was nice that they were having
their warm clothes already on sale and
it's just like the most cozy sweater
ever so I cannot wait to finally be able
to break this out I'm like come on down
but you're just draw a tiny bit so I
could wear this and the next thing that
I got at Abercrombie was this gray
pullover so it's actually super super
soft on the inside it's one of those
like super fuzzy blanket materials on
the inside of it and I just loved it
because it was plain and gray and you
can basically wear it with anything
it's a little bit cropped cropped but
like very like boxy I would say and it's
just the warmest most cozy thing ever I
actually don't even have any winter
clothes or warm clothes in my closet and
I don't really have time to go home so
I'm hoping my mom like comes up to
visits me anytime soon if you're
watching this mom I'm gonna give you a
call and you might need to bring my warm
clothes and the next store I'm gonna be
showing you guys is Windsor and I got a
lot of kind of like going out clothes
from Windsor which I'm excited to show
you guys and next weekend I am actually
going to Las Vegas for my friend's 21st
birthday so I'm very excited about that
and just kind of nervous and excited and
I don't know it'll be an interesting
time so the first dress that I got is
this pretty like sequined dress and I
feel like I have no idea what to expect
for Vegas because it's like a completely
different nightlife that I'm used to so
I bought it's just like random dresses
that I hope I can wear this is one
option let me know which option you
think is the best and if you've ever
been tell me what people wear there or
what I should wear so I might do a poll
on Instagram so be sure to follow me on
that on what I should wear when I'm
there but I got this sequins dress it's
off the shoulder and it's totally like
its chandelier look-alike I feel like
it's pretty it short and I don't like
that these dresses have like the hips
already lined out for you guys because
I'm scared I'm not gonna be able to fill
it and then it's just not gonna fit
right I really liked it because it was
such a statement dress and I feel like
you don't really need to wear jewelry
that much or you don't need a way or
like anything super fancy with it
because it's already such a statement
piece and the next thing I got from
Windsor is this denim jacket and I'm so
excited to wear this because it is denim
which I literally wear my denim jacket
which is also from Windsor that I got
last season every single day I'm not
kidding I won't wear that as often as I
can and it's just the perfect thing to
like throw on over any outfit so I got
this one it's more fitted and it has the
fur on the collar which i think is so
cute and it's such a good transition for
the colder weather so I'm really excited
to break this out once it gets a little
colder and then excellent that I got
from Windsor is this sweater so it's
kind of like the one
I got from Abercrombie except it's a
little thinner and it has some gray
specks in it really really like it's
it's oversized as well but this is more
like a dress tunic so I'm gonna be able
to wear this like either playing with
knee-high boots or with leggings or
something like that so this one's
definitely more of like a dress type but
I really really am obsessed with
sweaters if you guys don't know I wear
sweaters basically every single day in
the winter guy the next piece that I am
showing you guys is this other sweater
and it is super super cute because it's
off the shoulder so I really love that
so it's this off the shoulder sweater
and I'm obsessed I love off-the-shoulder
things and the sleeves are those like
big kind of like parachute sleeves
that's I don't know if that's what
they're called because they are tight
around the wrist and then they kind of
just puff out throughout so I think it's
really really different and unique so
I'm excited to wear this maybe just put
cute necklace on some jeans I don't know
um I think it's super super cute and
different because I've never really seen
it on people before and the next thing
that I got is this dress from Windsor
and the material is super weird it's
like rough on my fingers which is kind
of like oh it's like a velvet but a
little more rough than velvet so it is
this black drape a dress and it kind of
looks like sparkly like metallic black
but it's really about wits material with
some sparkles in it which might be the
reason why it's rough but it's just a
cute drape one and it's just I like it
because I feel like it just kind of like
fits on your body like it's like sits on
it so it's not too tight but it's not
like super loose and it's just like I
feel like it's a very elegant night life
if that makes sense
I don't know what I'm saying but I hope
that you guys understand I feel like we
have this like connection like you guys
totally know what I'm saying I don't
even have to worry about it but yeah I
might be wearing this out one night in
Vegas so let me know what you think and
the next thing that I got is this super
cute jumpsuit that is very like
fall-like because of the colors and then
I also kind of wanted to hop on the
pajama trend or pajama trend and the one
where you like wear the PJs out you know
and this I couldn't like fully commit so
I feel like this reminds me of it
because the top looks like it would be
one of those except it's all the way
down so it's definitely more like
elegant and cute and yeah I don't know
where I will wear this but I am excited
to wear this because it's so different
and I feel like I'm gonna need to get it
altered but I absolutely love this
jumpsuit and I love that it's
long-sleeve because all of my jumpsuits
are short sleeve or strapless or more
for summer so I love that I can
transition just transition this into the
winter and the next thing that I got I'm
getting a little bit of clueless vibes
from but obviously more neutral so I got
this plaid a tight skirt I think this is
perfect for the winter I love plaid
skirts that's one thing that I will buy
a ton of so this is kind of like the
denim skirt but for winter I think so I
am yet I feel like I'm gonna see a lot
of like plaid and preppy skirts versus
like denim skirts in the summer I think
that's gonna be the winter trend this is
gonna be so so cute and I got a matching
top to go with it so it is a two-piece
set which is why I bought this a little
bit cropped tight and it goes like
higher up like kind of like to your
collar bones so I really really really
love that and the next thing I've got
from Windsor is this bodysuit so it is
this plain black bodysuit I just wanted
one of these like a plain black tank top
that would be super fitted and just I
feel like this is the perfect going out
shirt so I will be definitely wearing
this this year and pretty much for every
season you can wear this I like it
because I don't have any shirts that are
straight across right here so this will
definitely be a cute look for me my
friend has one of these from another
store except she paid like I'm not
kidding I think like $80 for it and this
one was only 18 so Windsor is so
affordable which is that's why I really
really like it because all of these
pieces are very like in trend like
trendy that they may go out of style in
two years but like it doesn't really
matter because you didn't spend that
much money the next thing that I got
from Windsor is this super super cute I
am pumped to wear this I have literally
nothing like this
in my closet and it is this two-piece
set
it's this like I feel like it's like a
Japanese kimono style skirt so this is
the skirt and I am living for it I think
it is so freaking cute and different
like I had to buy it when I saw it
online and I am wearing it with a
matching crop top and I think that it is
the cutest outfit ever I'm so excited to
wear this I like it a ton let me know if
you guys like it because I think I'm
like I didn't think I needed that like
kimono style like fabric in my life but
I was so wrong because that is so cute
and I actually got a Halloween costume
from Windsor so I want you guys comment
down below and guess what the Halloween
costume is and also tell me what
Halloween tutorials you guys want me to
do because I'm not gonna show it to you
because I wanted to be a surprise but
I'm about to break out the Halloween
tutorials and I am very excited and the
last store that I will be showing you
guys is from Target and I got two pairs
of shoes from there which definitely
broke the bank I don't know why I did
that just target shoes are my weakness
most of my shoes are from Target like I
buy a lot of my shoes from there the
first pair are these loafers they're
kind of like the knockoff Gucci except
obviously they don't look like Gucci
loafers because they're from Target but
they're so cute so I just got these I
already have a pair of slip-on loafers
that I like these because they had the
fur on it and I think that is just so
freakin cute for winter and I'm too poor
to afford Gucci so I actually want to
buy the Gucci belt though and I am
seriously thinking of spending like $400
on a belt which is absolutely
mind-boggling to me but I love the belt
so much so I need you guys to let me
know if I should buy the belt if you
have it if it's a good investment I
don't know because it's a lot of money
to spend but like I just I don't know if
I just save up for it and then the last
pair of shoes I got are the most basic
shoes but I every single girl needs
these in their closet so it is just a
plain black bootie and if you guys know
me or have been watching you for a while
you know that I have probably seven
black booties in my closet but they're
all different and they all hold a piece
of my heart and I have a pair just like
this except like more leather material
from Target but the heel fell off so
like this bottom part fell off so every
time I walk it makes me loudest know
because that's not there anymore so he
had to buy another pair so this pair is
the perfect going out shoe if you are in
college and you go out ever at nighttime
and you need shoes that are not
open-toed but still like dressed up and
not just like sneakers these are the
ones where you go buy these right now
there are thirty dollars at Target and
they are so worth it I will wear these
every single time I go out like without
fail every time to go with every single
outfit so you need one of these in your
life and you don't want to spend a lot
of money because they're probably gonna
get dirty that's my two cents so I was
it for this haul it was a super quick
haul I feel like I normally have like
these huge extravagant ones and this one
was very much like not as much stuff but
I feel like that means I'll just have to
do another one later this season if you
guys want to see more hauls let me know
if you guys want to see what type of
videos or Halloween videos or fall
videos that you guys want to see let me
know in the comments below and thank you
guys so much for watching this video and
I'll see you guys in my next one
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
