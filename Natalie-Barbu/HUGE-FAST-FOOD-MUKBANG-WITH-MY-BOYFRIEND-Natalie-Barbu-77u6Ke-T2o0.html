way outside at the track they're like
half the curb do you know a song me

haven't picked your Taco Bell I think
I've only been like twice in my life and
laughter let's talk about was in high

nacho
I'll show my love to be wondering if I'm
vegan the answer is yes laughs I'd like

know we met in high school but we didn't
start a usual sophomore year of college
oh you wait for a while know what to not
beard I'm gonna try the Doritos Locos
Tacos now okay okay it doesn't even feel
crunchy you need a bathroom
why I'm not sure we probably know hello
why do people like watching these I love
watching them and I don't understand why
I like watching them so legend comment
down below
there's no I don't that shop although I
like to talk about I bash McDonald's cuz
they get 30 minutes to give us our food
all right wait a lot of people came to
my channel for like college video so
tell them about your major
that's what you're I'm not very smart
about two majors at unc-chapel and I'm
not very more but okay computer science
and information songs
yeah it are like um
is that what it's supposed to look like
I've never eaten that oh stop mm-hmm
well I want to keep it even authors but
if I do I'm not gonna believe anything
else I'm just gonna like rip apart that
those die because I can't it's like so
massive oh just look at that this thing
you guys I feel like a larger probably
think lip I changed my fangs where
people literally eat one bite of
something
not that one I love Olivia Jane she's my
favorite but she didn't look my mattress
pad which is like Queen I'm not legs um
she ate one in-n-out burger
like that's what I'd literally with my
girl blogs one In and Out Burger
that was the most bang mm-hmm all our
fast food fresh so there's my excuse to
just eat whatever I want is gonna try
this hilarious all right I like this
I've never had this
where does the potato one this is a
pacer Ito and it's enormous
look at this I hate got nothing else I
got crunchy noise look ships dead mm-hmm
why are you not comfortable on camera
that's the worst question to ask them
together oh no I don't like being on the
internet one like being public I don't
know
oh how do you like face them like a
being attacked like just on there
forever how do you feel that someone and
dating you know that it's on the
Internet
I mean that's your passion that's what
you love it there so I support it but I
don't like being yes that's right a
large bowl I feel like will wonder use
all of my new videos with your boyfriend
stuff but like so many people that do
social media couples type things I'm not
saying all of them but I don't a lot of
them are so fake like I know a girl who
I'm not many names her and her boyfriend
are so unhappy and they post Instagram
photos together all the time and like he
cheats on her all the time like there's
a very unhappy people and you know like
just cuz you post an Instagram photo
with a cube caption doesn't mean that
it's like relationship goals so you
order this with no meaning anymore it's
not true it's good that was a myth that
the meat is like 2 percent real they're
fake mean or whatever this potato thing
honestly not realized really
good hello your favorite talked about
they were talking about whatever or your
favorite fast food I might not even
remotely close to be told I am right I
want to eat more than him yes for him
you're almost full
I need like 3,000 calories a day they
want to know that's spicy
okay um what else what else
comment down below any videos you guys
want to see you with me and him one
weapon tell me if this is missing try it
well just put the hottest sauce on here
I should have checked you
I should have secretly did it is it
after those places I've never tried
Diablo sauce it says it'll make you
sweat
is it is it bad
I don't know know but I feel like one of
those are not gonna hit me where's the
McDonald's oh wait there's still this
it's like a lingering spice but it's not
like you ordered everything without them
there's no chicken in the case of death
and no station if you wanted to talk
about me Annette all right well this
thing looks really weird cuz there's
nothing in it I'm like way too much
budgeted though some spicy food I can
handle I think I cannot handle like like
Asian spicy food like curry and curry is
so spicy like I if I'm going to a Thai
restaurant I get 0 spite so I can't
handle that - the spice like Mexican
spice I can handle
I can't handle anything
well there
that's really good
holy this is amazing
they have such good dessert have you
ever had one of these
there's syrup I have in the image you
there's syrup in side of the bun it's a
pancake with syrup in it and there's
like a game too so you have you tried
and I'll try this
mmm wait.you oh my god this is the worst
mcdonald's ever you've literally ordered
chicken yeah
that's not what I were to him what is
this she even repeated it that's the
this thing I ordered about with beef why
are there like Fritos on it let's talk
about what is this this is so fun yeah
it's the best thing in the college but
this thing looks grew after the smoothie
but they gave me the wrong smoothie yeah
this McDonald was so bad if you live in
Raleigh it's the one on Western
Boulevard
it was awful you got until graduation
Victor today I'm graduating in two days
I don't like this a new women go down
chicken
right yeah it's just all right not
remain I did not like that home I don't
talk about spilling I had like three
bites of this and I was kind of full but
I can get like a million tacos could you
order everything without you order like
half of it written English this is
supposed to meet them like this will be
filling if there was no bottom if
there's no patty it would just be a
buyer no wonder you don't think it's
filling but can you imagine if I feel
like refill this knock on wood
well what I'm like no so then don't have
to read from a video even mic isn't
working or like the it doesn't look good
or whatever like I would just not be
able to refill this so this is what I
eat every day
McDonald's has hands down the best fries
in the entire universe Barbies no
McDonald I'm telling it like you will
not find one better place for a price at
McDonald's they're good but our thesis
is way better
no no what no just the perfect they're
not curly crunchiness and like what is
it length and thickness and saltiness
they're a good selfie if you want to the
definition of the most horrific crimes
so if you guys myung-bak on on Instagram
I don't use inter this see David
ninety-nine boy surprise when I show you
have a boyfriend but well you're not my
behind the camera so you take a lot of
my pictures like McDonald's gets me full
