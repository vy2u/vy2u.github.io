haul video for you guys so this is all
the stuff that I bought in like maybe
like literally second semester maybe
even more and it is almost finals so
this is a cumulative Hall it's not
anything that i bought in one trip so
don't think i could afford all of it and
yeah so i'm just going to get right into
it so this video isn't like 30 minutes
long Oh first thing I'm going to show
you guys is what I wear underneath my
clothes I know it's scandalous right
money yeah it is a company called adore
me um I don't know if you guys have
heard of it before I've heard of it um I
heard that around Halloween because they
had a bunch of halloween costumes and I
was looking for it on there but yeah so
anyways it's just a company that you
sign up for a membership and then I
think you get forty dollars for every
set and each set comes like a bra and
underwear so basically the price of one
bra at victoria's secret is the price
per bra and underwear set at adore me
and so that's just how it works I guess
I ordered this online and I'm obviously
not going to show you guys it on because
that's kind of kind of risky but um
anyways I feel good whenever I wear like
cute bras and matching underwear with
justice a pink bra it is has lace on it
right underneath here and then it's just
hot pink and I think it's a super cute
and I actually is a push-up bra but
that's cuz I'm like yeah you guys I'm
setting videos before I need it all the
help I can get
then it comes with matching underwear so
I just got this late hot pink lace one
and then i also got and too excited for
this Aperol let so not all of them are
just like rubber underwear like you can
also get like bandos so i just wore this
with a see-through shirt it was like a
white lace tank top and I wore this
underneath because I really like that
whole like lacy even like a paint booth
mando I do that a lot in the summer
you'll see that and some summer look
folks coming up but um yeah so I got
this banjo and it's kind of like a silky
material but not really and then it has
purple lace all-around flowers on it and
I think it's so cute and then it is a
reason back which I like because when
you're wearing normal take tops you can
still wear Razorbacks and then when
you're wearing it not Razorbacks we're
working right Razorbacks you have to
wear Razorbacks oh yeah that's why I
really like this bando and then I got
the matching underwear to go with it and
since Diego and since this was my first
sight I would get for 2495 so you can
get your first set for 2495 i will link
it down below um you have to click on
the links and i'll have it links right
here too and yeah they have really cute
bras and underwear zand on a college
budget I can't believe Ford going a
memory secret and getting almost super
cute ones so yeah this is a great
company and I really like how they have
kind of like a membership thing because
then I'm forstride cute bras mentors and
I don't know I think I always feel good
when I'm wearing like matching ones or
keep one and even though no one's seeing
them I still think that
welchol it'll straight earth a little
bit of a better day when you're wearing
matching underwear and bras so yeah
definitely check out that website and I
will have everything links down below
the next door is going to be Windsor and
okays no Windsor is like my favorite
store ever they have such cute things
and on a budget it's the first thing
that I'm going to show you is these
pants so there are 70s inspired pants
I'll show you on my instagram if you
guys want to look over there I have a
way that I style these i posted can like
the note of the day with them um yeah
they are kind of a thicker material so I
wasn't in the winter but i also had
leggings on underneath so you've
definitely ready to the summer without
leggings and then um they're just like
white and black and have the bell bottom
so the picture looks way better but yeah
this is what they look like an i am
obsessed with 70s inspired clothes I
really wish I went to Coachella this
year as I do wish every year but one day
I will go you guys I promise you I will
go to Coachella one year and I will be
wearing these kind of dance the next
thing that I got is also kind of
festival inspired I really like that
look for the summer um is this kimono so
I'm loving kimonos you guys saw this in
my favorites video you watch that but
yeah again I have also have this on my
Instagram I'm like a fashion Instagram
now so if you guys want to follow me for
outfit in the days definitely do that um
but yeah it's just a kimono and it has
these little tassels at the bottom and I
really really like the colors of it and
I kid you not i get so many compliments
every time I wearing um so yeah
very like catches the eye and it's super
cute the next thing that I got in the
winter is a colorful rubber you guys
also saw this in my favorites video but
it is a neon floral robber and I look so
tan in it and they look amazing like it
soon as it brings out your tan it just
makes you look so good and again another
Instagram picture you guys definitely
follow me for Instagram like fashion
alpha the day type that always post
those um but yeah so next thing that I
got is also from winter and it's another
neon thing so it is this neon dress
another instagramming that you guys
would see oh but yes so it has this
crossbow like these cross sections on
the front that's what I think drew my
attention to it because of this because
if it's a path that it just because I
like a plain neon dress but this really
makes people like notice what you're
wearing and it's so so cute ok the next
thing I got is not from Windsor but it
is from just a random store called
altered state I don't know if yes I've
heard of it we have it here in Raleigh I
go to tool in Raleigh and they have it
added the streets of southpoint so if
any of you guys live in Durham comment
down below because i love the streets of
southpoint they have a store there and i
got it there it's just like a t-shirt
dress in a lot earth of epsilon group
it's about a t-shirt dress in olive
green Wow is insane Navy turning down to
olive green and then have these buttons
on the back which I thought were cute
and at first I thought that this like
opened up so I had to wear like pants
with it but it's actually the same like
material like it's like another layer so
it's still a dress it just kind of opens
up here too
that make sense so like opens up here so
there's another liar and then it's like
you think I got was from another random
fatigue in charlotte north carolina
which is where i live I'm not what's
your name of it but it's just kind of
close to my lip and it's this is a maxi
dress and I help maxi dresses i'm
addicted to maxi dresses and so I got
this maxi dress and it has a very
colorful front do it and coolkid like
tribal patterns and it has this really
pretty like aqua belt on it it's just a
long one and then bent it on the back in
the back is gorgeous i love these open
bags i used to going to run sticky boobs
with it so if you don't see any like bra
strap obviously in the back of but i'm
really excited to wear this I need to
get it alternative but um I hate getting
dresses altar though like it's your
sister to pain to go over there a San
Aldred take it off pick it back up like
I had my sorority formal tomorrow and I
still haven't altered my dress and it's
like five o'clock so hopefully I can
find someplace that doesn't in one day
because like it's literally far up the
next thing that i'm wearing is for the
next thing that i'm wearing the next
thing that I bought it's from the same
boutique in Charlotte and I have got so
many pumpkins on the shirt I work at the
airport am I getting back to school like
everyone was like ooh I love that shirt
so you guys this is a cue sure if you
guys want to purchase it you'll get a
ton of compliments anyways it is this
kind of like grayish purple shirt and
it's just like a normal t-shirt in the
front and it has a hole like
no no pattern on I utterly note that is
I always kind of look for hidden
messages in these because some of them
are like kind of creepy so that I won't
get them like the urban outfitter system
like we're the quechee board stuff that
I don't really want wearing but yeah
this one I think it's just a normal
pattern I don't think it's any secret
message ooh and then in the back it has
these like being has cutouts at the your
shoulder bone this is your collar but I
don't of your shoulder blades shoulder
blades shoulder bones wow it's been a
long day the next thing I got is from
one of my favorite stores which is
people make fun before but Abercrombie I
am obsessed fat or ugly I think it is so
cute and actually wearing it tonight
because it is mad birthday guys so I am
in 19 years old today and I'm going to
the melting pot so I don't have the
melting pot and I'm wearing this so it
is this olive green romper it's like a
low V which I think I'm gonna have two
more like another band I wonder neath it
may be just like black one and then it
has these really really flowy like
sleeves I really like them because
they're normal up until like kind of
like the bottom quarter bottom and then
they blow out so this is another thing
that I would have probably boards like
Coachella so much flash tattoos or
something I don't know I dream of going
to coachella one day and I literally
have all my outfits picked out my head
so bad even once said me next year you
know just like hit me up if I will
definitely go well I'll
I think I got I got actually this past
weekend I was in savannah georgia and it
is beautiful beneath us live there i'm
jealous it was my very first time there
but I went to free people on one of
those popular streets i think it was
called Lake for an arch street not sure
anyways this was thirty dollars and it
was originally two hundred dollars so it
is just this tank top and I had black
and it has kind of like a triangle kind
put out right here so again another
thing I'll program to our band 04 and
yeah as much like cut out stud what I
we're free people stuff and then in the
back that has these two like a little
opening I really love free people
because all the detail that they have
that's like my favorite store ever so
yeah it was thirty dollars instead 100 I
don't know who would be a hundred
dollars for that but you know he was on
sale in the only one left and I was on
my side it was like meant to be i have
together the next thing that I got is
from where okay it's from guess and I
don't show that yes but when I went in
there I found so many things that I
liked it is kind of a sense of them so I
did only by one thing but I really
wanted a pair of overalls and I have
literally like the long overalls but I
got a pair of these short overalls from
guests and we think they are so cute and
I like them because they were like tight
kinda they weren't like super flowy
baggy they were like fitted and so I
feel like that's a lot cuter than just
baggy overalls look at the costume so
yes they are basically overalls from
here up and then normal shorts at the
bottom and also i want to start kind of
a blog and not just instagram like kind
of like a wordpress or something i have
one i think i actually have to but I
literally never go on them but i think
i'm gonna dis summer after finals cuz
you're by finals i'm going to make an
actual blog because i really really want
to start one up and if you guys don't
follow um graceful made that's all
liquor down below me and her actually
came friends i know i have a friend okay
and anyways she goes to chapel hill
which is really close to where i have
school and she like she's a very popular
blogger but like she kind of inspired me
to make my own blog the more minute
we've been hanging out and stuff and she
was telling me like all about blogging

and her are actually going to do a video
together so if any of you guys follow

introduced her to youtube she can
introduce me to blogging so definitely
look out for that i'd check her out if

awesome she has a cute his clothes and
she's just like the sweetest
the next thing that I got is from Randy
and I got this dress is another t-shirt
dress in olive green I promise I got a
lot of olive green stuff bye guys it
just plain olive green dress the next
thing that I got is from forever 21 and
surprisingly hypothesis that I really
really like their I don't know I just
haven't been finding anything lately
that I like at that store but yeah it is
this needy ok notice sunday because navy
blue stripes but it's a white dress and
it kind of looks like a bathing suit
cover-up because it's not it's like very
beachy um it's kinda it's like a towel
material ish but then it has this these
little things and I have a food and it's
sleeveless and I've just been obsessed
with the stress lately I think I've won
it through time and I bought it like two
weeks ago so if that tells everything
next from abercrombie also i forgot to
show you guys this I finally found
myself an envelope skirt I don't think
you guys know how hard I was looking for
a cheap envelope skirt so i got this
from abercrombie and was fifty percent
off so that's why so cheap but yeah I'd
like white envelope skirt and it has
it's like like padding I don't know it's
like the material feels like a Catholic
padding like padded walls or something
like that
next I got another think often it was
from a Nordstrom and I got plane take
off Razorback so I could wear that very
cute bandeau with it but yeah um boring
the next thing that I got news from
Dick's Sporting Goods and I've been
starting to work out a lot lately so
maybe over the summer if I actually
start working out like every single day
I think I might maybe I'll do like a
healthy food video for you guys if you
want um but yeah so I got myself this
and I can take top which i think is so
cute I might wear it just my going out
it's like James because like it's real
cute um it's just a 90 taking office of
nike and a big bubble letter has been
blacked out lighting and then it's like
a muscle tank so these big asleep and I
got some spandex for me so I have black
spandex but I got some like Nike pros in
blue and green and I thought these were
really cute colorful and perfect in the
summer ok so for accessories I'm going
to start out with the purses I have free
christmas show you guys I know it's bad
but anyways first person i got it's from
the bellow i don't know if you guys have
heard of the bellow I know they shop
they have online and they have it in
like a bunch of places in North Carolina
but I don't know about everywhere else
makes just a boutique that sells a bunch
of cute brands so I just got this bag
it's just out like a paga a light wash
out Rose peachy color don't really know
it's just a very key value has a zipper
up here and
inside of it and it also came with one
of these across the crossbody strings to
put on but I just really wanted a
chained small purse and I love it for
the summer so I've been wearing it a lot
lately another purse that I got is from
Windsor actually and i won this
literally all second semester I worried
actually not literally literally all
half second semester the way i use
literally i gotta stop anyways it is
just a white bag and it has gold and
silver ish sheds on it and I really
cross bike bag so that's why I got it
and yeah and then the next sack I showed
you guys on my Instagram when i bought
it but it from Topshop in Nordstrom and
it's just a big black bag I really
wanted to explain a black bag that I
know where to class if I just have like
a laptop or something or just a book or
something like that trust me this is not
my backpack I have a north face but it's
a just like to carry much stuff is kind
of like a travel bag so yeah I got this
big block back next to my accessories I
am obsessed with it is my hats so this
hat i got from Urban Outfitters yes what
it looks like I really like these big
like why permits oh I wear this hat all
the time I've worn it so many times so
yeah even looks like this
now I might wear it I think it's really
an outfit or the next half that I got is
from Windsor and purplish Marie color
this one has a shorter top and but it's
like a big like flowy floppy hat which i
think is so cute I picture myself
wearing it on my Instagram to is so
sneak past yeah get some I'm a while ago
by vfm stock me please feel free and the
next thing i got is also from windsor
and there are these boots and I love
wearing these especially when I go out
at night I always just throw on a big
hair growth a big bear I always go on
boots when it was cold outside now
that's where I don't really have to but
I wear these with dresses I wear them
with jeans I've one needs to class
they're very Universal and I absolutely
love them and next thing that I got is
the front it's racy your pink and I just
got this bathing suit it kind of reminds
me of triangle but not really because
it's cuter and it's like patterns on it
and i really like the material of it and
i'm really digging a little fish like
triangle style bikinis and then the
bottoms that I got are these orange one
and they are a little bit cheeky just
getting not really good I don't know why
I chose
now last but not least is my makeup
first thing that I got is this soft in
not soft in general it is the
mineralized skin finish but it is in the
color global glow and wow I've never
known out of this I love it so much like
if they just continue this would you cry
it is my favorite thing to put on ever
it is so pretty i just put it right here
on the highlights and it makes me look
so bronze and not oily with sugary at
the same time and it's it's a very very
good product next thing i got was um Mac
prep and prime because i'm at my Urban
Decay spray so I just try it and wow I
really like it on my makeup always feel
so refreshed after I wear it so I
definitely put this upon I know I put it
on after my makeup and then just midday
whenever my makeup starting to kind of
look not as good and then the next thing
I'm wearing right now it is this Mac
Rosie Bram lip pencil I wore this in my
prom video this is the color of a it's
just a very plain pink color which is
perfect for me that's kind of what I was
looking for wearing it right now and

from
the next two things I got our premise

primer with anti acne treatment and this
