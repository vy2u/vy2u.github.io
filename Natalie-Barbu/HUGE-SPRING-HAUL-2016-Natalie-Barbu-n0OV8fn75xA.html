I am filling a home video for you guys I
am so excited because I have not filmed
the haul video in so long and this one
is just kind of a huge spring haul I
have so much stuff and this was not all
at once
oh my goodness I don't think I could do
all of this at once this was about a
span of like a month and a half that
I've been collecting some spring clothes
so I'm just gonna hop right into this
video give this video a thumbs up if you
love hauls I know that most of you guys
do and let me know what you think in the
comments below of what is your favorite
item is don't be afraid to leave like 5
comments at once throughout the video
because your comments really mean a lot
to me and yeah so I just really love
getting comments is camera to bright a
little bit alright so we are just going
to get started in the hall and normally
I do like clothing at first because
everyone loves clothes but today I can
honestly sit up because I have a lot of
accessories that I got so I'm going to
do accessories first so the first thing
that I'm going to show you guys is
actually what I wear underneath my
clothes and no I will not be trying
these on so that's disgusting it is from
adore me and I have shown these in a
haul before I really love adore me it's
an subscription service where you get
bras and underwear Zoar robes or
sleepwear pajamas whatever a month and
you pay a certain fee for it and instead
of paying like fifty dollars for a bra
and thirty dollars for underwear or
whatever it is that Victoria's Secret
you get a bra and underwear set so you
are always matching your underwear and I
will have the link to it down below the
first bra that I got was this really
pretty kind of lace purple bra I don't
know I like tan bras but they're so
boring but you can wear them under
everything so that's like pretty close
to a tan color but the reason I like
this is because of the back of the bra
it's like it's like not Razorback I
don't know how to describe it but I
really really like this so when I wear
to take top with an open back
this is definitely gonna be cute and
then it connects in the front of the
borough and then I got a matching
underwear with it so this is what the
underwear looks like the lace is so
pretty you guys it's just so delicate
and I am obsessed
the next bra that I got from them is
super super cool
it is this pink lik bralette but it's
actually wired so it keeps you supported
and this is what it looks like
so when you wear it it's actually just
like a bra wet like it looks like a
banjo it doesn't look like a bra but you
are supportive or support and it says
that is what's important
but yeah it's including like a bra life
I'm obsessed with it and then I got this
magic underwear to go with it so it is
just the pink lace I think it's so
pretty the lace on it and if you don't
get the membership the subscription
membership you can still buy it a month
or you can still buy it like purchase it
without having a subscription it's just
a little more expensive so it's actually
more worth it to just get the
subscription service among you can
cancel it whenever you want
so yeah I would definitely do that and
then the next thing I got is the most
exciting thing and it is this robe so
this black robe I'm obsessed with robes
and then the sleeves are like super cute
like French mania I feel like that's
what it looks like is that a word French
maybe it's like heaven it's so soft the
next accessories that I want to show you
guys are some jewelry so they are from
happiness boutique I found them online
it's an online jewelry store they have
some really there's some really really
cute statement necklaces so I'm actually
wearing one of them right now so this is
what it looks like it is gorgeous and
they're super super cheap so if you want
something like three people Urban
Outfitters II this is definitely like a
good dupe for it because they're a lot
cheaper and then the next one that I got
is this other like super statement
necklace which is absolutely gorgeous
I'm up
that's with it I'll be doing a spring
lookbook that's why I don't want to try
anything on right now I was gonna make
this a try on haul but I'm doing a
spring break workbook which is gonna
include a lot of these items so that's
what you guys will just have to wait and
see that the next accessory that I got
are some shoes and these are my babies
look at this these are beautiful you
guys tell me that these are not gorgeous
these are from Windsor store calm love
Windsor you guys know that I like put so
many pictures of them but yes so they
lace up around your ankles look they are
just so pretty and I love the olive
green color
the next thing also from Windsor is a
hats that I got I've been really loving
baseball caps on people and I really
want to learn for myself so this one is
a leather black baseball hat this part
of it is actually just like cloth
material but this part is leather I
think they are super cute
wasn't me trying to create my thumbnail
right now guys the next thing that I got
is from romwe calm it is a really really
cheap online store as well and I'm like
obsessed with online shopping in case
you guys didn't know because in college
I don't really have time to go to the
mall so I just online shop but yeah the
first thing I got from there is this
really cool address I'm obsessed with
all of these two cutout dresses I really
really have been into them so this dress
this is the front of it so it's like
that in the front and then it kind of
looks like a two-piece and then it's
like super long so it's kind of like a
mini dress I am so excited to wear this
though it's nice and tight and then it
has like that cutout right there but
it's not provocative or anything like
that it's actually it just looks like it
has a cutout like right here the next
thing that I got from romwe is this
super cute suede skirt so it has the
lace ups in the front which is a huge
trend and it's actually super stretchy
in the back which I like because I hate
when skirts are big around the waist and
everyone's waist is different just a
suede skirt is gorgeous I'm like so
excited to wear this this would look
cute with like a black maybe like
tighter top or even okay even denim I
know that it's kind of kind of weird
right if you like a denim jacket bring
back the denim jacket with this buy what
kinda looks cool but yeah you guys will
definitely be seeing all of these gonna
look books probably the next thing I got
is from Shion comso another online store
this is just a huge online spring haul
and the first dress that I got is this
orange like bright orange dress I'm
really into colors and just dresses and
body cons so this is just a bright
orange tighter dress it's not super
tight but it is a really great material
and yeah it just has like a cute little
cut right there but it's still a higher
neck and then it has an open back or a
cutout in the back the next dress that I
got from there is a very very different
I will I was shocked that I wanted to
buy it but I wanted to try it out and it
is extremely low-cut so I am actually
getting something
like a piece of fabric sewn along the
cleavage area but I'm obsessed with this
dress but yeah I'm gonna get some what I
think I want some like white or maybe
even red just cover right here you know
those dresses that have like that strip
right there so I'm gonna get that sewn
into it but it is gorgeous I'm like oh
my gosh you guys I don't even own red
dresses I just never wear red so this is
super super different for me the next
thing that I got my machine calm is this
dress that is very similar to the black
one except it's more casual because the
material isn't as thick it's more of a
t-shirt material so this is what it is
again it's like that cutout and the
crisscross effect your boob area and
it's just a light pink and it's more
flowy but it's very like t-shirt
material and the straps you can adjust
them I think it's super cute the next
door I'm going to show you guys is
Lulu's calm and me and my best friend
Grace she's a blogger we did a
Valentine's Day or galentine's Day photo
shoot with this dress so you guys have
seen it before but I decided it showed
in the hall so it's one of those that
comes up high at the neck and then it's
like a low back so that's how it fits
the next store I'm going to show you
guys is a Windsor store so you guys
already saw a couple accessories from
there but I am obsessed with Windsor you
guys know that everyone knows that I
always have to include them in a haul
because I shop there online a lot and I
post their pictures a lot because they
repost a lot of Instagram pictures and
they're just very Instagram or any
pictures the first thing that I got was
this dress I was shopping for my spring
break I'm going to Miami for spring
break in two weeks which I am so excited
about and this will definitely be seeing
videos from in there let me know if you
think I should vlog I'm going with my
friends so I don't know how they feel
about vlogging but let me know if you
guys think about I should blog so this
dress is a black flowy dress
and it's off the shoulder so that's what
it looks like it's like an
off-the-shoulder black dress super flowy
I'm gonna wear these looks like some
gladiator sandals or something like that
I think that would be really really cute
a little shifty it is the next spring
thing that I got from Windsor is this
romper so it is like it looks like this
the colors are gorgeous on this dress or
on this romper that Kenzie and it's just
pretty short and the pattern I'm
obsessed with and I love the crochet
little detailing along the top part of
this romper the next thing from way so
that I got is another romper this one is
a little more fancy but I love this
rubber and then Singh obsessed a lot so
I'm gonna try stop stop saying that
so this is what the romper looks like
it's a lot fancier definitely it's more
fancy and this is what it is it is so
cute you guys I like it because even
though it's a V it's very close together
V so it's actually not revealing and the
crisscross in the front I think is so
cute and so in right now the next door
that I'm going to show you guys is Urban
Outfitters
I love Urban Outfitters you guys know
that first thing that I got from Urban
is again something very different I
don't own anything like this and I
haven't tried it on yet but it looks
cute so it is a bodysuit so this looks
like a one-piece bathing suit but it
just makes it look like when you're in
shorts or jeans that your shirt is super
tight tucked in so you don't have like
wrinkles or anything like that so I'm
not gonna be wearing this leotard out
just like a big baby I'm going to wear
with pants or shorts so it's just plain
gray has four triangles up top and I
kind of want to wear this with a army
green jacket or army green shirt on top
of this I don't know I think that would
be super cute the next thing that I got
from Urban is something that is totally
trendy it is this adidas t-shirt it's
just a plain t-shirt that you can get
from adidas anywhere but it's a silver
gray like metallic grey because II
design
I think it's really cute and I have my
adidas superstars so I'm like totally
into adidas now guys like totally not a
bandwagon fans I'm just kidding I really
like adidas but it's honestly if I'm
being honest it's because I see everyone
else wearing it and I like what I see
the next thing that I got from Urban
Outfitters is also something super cool
this is definitely my most different
haul a lot of these things that I'm
showing you guys I have never purchased
in my life
it is this metallic bralette so of
course bro let's and you don't wear
these as shirts I hope not at least but
I am going to be wearing these with
shirts that you can kind of see through
to make sure that you see my bra light
or it might be like lower cut v-necks to
have this peek through it is so so
pretty you guys and I've never seen
anything this metallic and then the next
thing that I got from Urban I'm actually
wearing right now but it is this bra let
that you see underneath my shirt so
normally how I would wear it it's like I
would scoop it down a little bit yeah
it's basically a bralette that comes up
and you can see this detail and then the
next thing that I got is actually from
Windsor I forgot to show you guys but it
is this bra less another Briella
I am super into these I'm very into a
kind of underneath things right now I
don't know if that's like a good or bad
thing but I got this one and it's super
cool it has lace obviously of we're like
the boob part is but I like it because
it goes up in the middle so when I would
be wearing this shirt it would be like
something would be coming up to my neck
like choking me guys the next time I'm
gonna be showing the guys is Victoria's
Secret pink
I just got two things from Victoria's
Secret and again they're like I'm so now
filming this video like wow I need a
chill but I got this bro lights another
one I really do need a show I'm sorry
guys
it is this really fun color not to hide
I'm more like floral print but like
super neato and pastel colors mixed
together and then the next thing that I
got from Victoria's Secret is a sports
bra so I will not be wearing this on the
rig I will just wearing it when I work
out the next door I'm gonna be showing
you guys is forever 21 and from forever
21
so you only ordered workout clothes
first thing that I got from forever 21
are these leggings there's super cool
you guys they are black leggings with
marble down the side of them since
marble is so in why not get them on your
clothes the next thing that I got from
forever 21 is this windbreaker so it is
just this blue bright blue windbreaker
with kind of aqua blue aquamarine blue
down the sleeves and it's just really
comfortable and it's a good rain jacket
I'll wear it in the rain when it's not
too cold outside because it has a fluid
and I really like the quality of
everything that's where he'll close
they're very very inexpensive compared
to Lululemon and Nike and all of those
other big brands and they are just as
great so maybe not may not just as great
but like right underneath there the next
thing that I got from her 21 are more
sports bras so this sports bra I got I
really like it because it's cute and
because when I wear I can wear this on
the rag with like open back things
because look at the back of it and then
another sports bra that I got just was
this one it kind of looks like you're
making music or something like that I
don't really know I just like the silver
I'm really into silver instead of gold I
used to be into gold and now I have
transitioned to silver and then the back
is another really cool back and then the
last thing I got from parrot anyone are
these shorts they are just plain running
shorts I really just wanted some plain
black so the next door that I'm showing
you guys is called Sam shoe stores I
literally have no idea how to pronounce
it so I'm you're going to put it right
here for you guys to see because I don't
want to butcher the name anymore than I
already did first thing that I got from
there is this super cool leather gold
jacket it is insane I've never seen
anything like this I love it I don't
know when I'm going to wear this but I'm
excited just to have this to my closet
this is like an accessory or a piece of
art in itself the next thing that I got
is this beautiful maxi dress I think I'm
going to wear this to my sorority formal
so it is this gorgeous maxi dress it's
black and silver my two favorite
and it's kind of cut out right here and
