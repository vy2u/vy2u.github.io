here and today I am filming a sit-down
video for you guys it's actually a huge
giant haul that I want to show you guys
because I am leaving for spring break
and at two days so I am so excited and I
just got a whole shipment in from
Windsor and I really want to show you
guys because this is literally all my la
stuff because if you didn't know I'm
going to LA for spring break and I'm so
freaking pumped oh my gosh if you guys
live in LA let me know if you guys are
doing anything for spring break I want
to hear your spring break great I want
to hear your Spring Break plan so I can
be insanely jealous and also just so
that we can see where we're all going if
any of us are going to the same place
but comment that down below and when
your spring break is because mine I feel
like it's super early it's the first
week of March so I literally leave for
spring break March 2nd and the bad thing
about that is that it's still cold even
in LA so like I'm gonna have to bundle
up because I thought very spring summer
clothing so yeah before we get started
in this video I just want to say if
you're new here please subscribe it
would mean the world to me and be sure
to hit the push notifications button
because YouTube has been all funky
lately you know you guys know the drill
you guys you guys already know and if
you're part of the notification squad
comment down below to follow me on
Instagram so you can actually see how I
style these outfits and then without
further ado let's just get into the hall
alright so I'm just picking up a few
things to show you guys I have a lot of
stuff and I'm so excited ok so the first
thing that I got is this body suit so it
is this long sleeve off the shoulder
super cute all black bodysuit this is
gonna be super cute just tucked into
some denim and maybe layer it with like
a denim jacket or also you can wear this
with like a cute little skirt with a
denim jacket something like that I just
am obsessed with these like tight little
body suits and I feel like they're the
best because they look like a tough
tucked in shirt without to actually I
mean you tuck it in and and dealing with
that hassles so the next thing that I
got is another really really really cute
thing I'm gonna go ahead and say this
I'm gonna say the word cute way too much
in this video
so I am so sorry about that this skirt
it is a Slade little miniskirt and it
has like the tie down the middle and
it's so nice really really love suede
skirts I feel like this is such a
neutral color so you can literally wear
with anything and I surely like tight
pieces I don't know I feel like for my
body type they are more flattering
because I am petite so if I wear
anything like too loose or something I'd
be like it just like swallows me up the
next thing I am so excited about because
I have always wanted a pair of these so
they are these jeans and they are so
cool you guys oh my gosh like I don't
use the word sick but if I did I feel
like these jeans would be described as
sick you know I sound like I'm like a 45
year old mother is that what the kids
are saying these days and these black
jeans they're so cute and they have rips
and they have the red stripes down the
sides and they're just these like
distress kind of like boyfriend ish
jeans and I just think they're like the
coolest jeans ever and I'm gonna feel so
freakin badass on them and I'm so
excited to wear them and at the bottom
they're all like destroyed and
distressed and I just think they're so
cool and very very la the next thing I
got I want to wear with those jeans but
I don't know if it's gonna be a little
much so I got this like checkered which
reminds me of like the original vans
shoes its checkered t-shirts with the
red on the like sleeves and across the
neck think it's so cute it's a little
bit cropped and a little bit tight not
too tight but I don't know I feel like
it would look super cool with that those
jeans unlike a denim jacket or something
but I don't want to look too like
costumey so they were like I'm trying
too hard so I'm gonna see but I really
really like this shirt regardless the
next top that I got is definitely a
super cute top that I feel like it's a
basic for your closet and but yeah it
has like a little different twist to it
so it is just a t-shirt but it has like
the cutout so just the collar stays on
and it's a little loose and then it's
tied at the bottom so like a little crop
top and I feel like this is a shirt
thing that like people are doing
themselves like they're cutting the
colors off the shirts they're tying the
bottoms of them so I just think it's
really cool
this already came that way and if you
guys have been following my channel for
years you guys know addicted to stripes
and I think I have like maybe 12 right
t-shirts in my closet so we're just
adding another ones who think collection
and the next thing I got gives me major
Kim Kardashian vibes and like easy vibes
so when I first pulled this out of the
box that came in the mail I just thought
I ordered some like super large leggings
and I was very kind of you this because
this is what it looks like and I was
like why is the crotch like a foot away
longer than a foot away from the top of
those leggings and then I realized wait
no this is the romper slash jumpsuit
that I got so it's a body con jumpsuit
and it reminds me so much with Kim
Kardashian because I feel like she wears
these all the time I feel like it would
be super cool to wear and what better
place to like try out your style than a
Los Angeles California I feel like
everyone there is just like trendsetters
and everything like that so I just
wanted to wear I don't know like some
like Yeezy vibes in LA I don't know I
liked it I want to try it out the next
thing that I got was this denim jacket
and this is another one of those pieces
that I feel like is super super cool and
I just feel like I don't know wearing it
like very very cool
this denim jacket that's buttoned right
now and it looks a little small so I'm
definitely gonna have to unbutton it
which I was planning on anyways but it's
a cropped one it's super thin and it's
like distressed at the bottom and it's a
little bit distressed at like the
sleeves and it does look a little small
which is concerning to me but I just
really really like the fit of it and how
its cropped and thin and I'm excited to
wear it I really do want another one of
these does it's might be like a little
thicker and a little more oversized yet
still cropped so I might do like a
goodwill run and try to just find a
large denim jacket and I can cut it
myself but I don't know if you looked at
me cool I just did a thrift with me also
on my channel so if you guys want to see
that definitely can because I looked at
goodwill and they actually had a lot a
lot of cute things and I was pleasantly
surprised I really really do like this
but I do want to do some do-it-yourself
things if you
need to do do-it-yourself videos on my
channel let me know because I would love
to film if I ever do a DIY I am NOT a
DIY person so from people who are not in
DIY people it's like whenever I watch
them I'm just like how do you make it
look so easy and I'm trying to do it and
it literally looks like a pile of
garbage so if you want me to do a DIY
that hopefully turns out successful or
like a DIY for dummies because I don't
know how to do them either don't worry
you're not alone then you know comment
down below if you guys want me to do one
of those also sorry if I keep touching
my hair I just like I never part it to
the side so it's it's like kind of
getting in my face but I really really
like party it's to the side when I do
these like big waves
I feel like this hairstyle reminds me of
Susan Hendricks cuz she always does like
the side part with the big curls and I'm
like I love her so anyways back to the
hall the next thing that I got is this
cute skirt so it looks a little tiny so
let's hope it fits because I haven't
tried any of these onions I'm waiting to
try them on for the camera but this camo
skirt I think it's so cute and camo is
so in right now so this I feel like
would be cute with the black body con or
like over the new me black boots or
something like that or like the denim
jacket that I just show you guys but
yeah I really really really like it and
I'm really happy the camos coming back
in because I actually have always been a
fan of it I've always loved it I've
always thought army green was like one
of my favorite colors to wear so yeah it
just got me pumped to see that it was
back in and then the next thing that I
got is this see-through mesh bodysuit so
I am obsessed with this it's gonna be so
cute to wear was like a black bralette
or like a black cami underneath if I'm
not feeling too risque cuz that might be
a little scandalous so with like a black
cami underneath and I just love like the
stars that are embroidered into this I
just think it's so freakin cute oh my
gosh I this was like one of the pieces I
was most excited about and the next
thing that I got is this top it's really
really cute it is another off the
shoulder like it's like um what is this
material
it's this material its off-the-shoulder
it's crossed I think it's so cute it's a
crop you can wear with like high-waisted
jeans or a skirt or something like that
I just think it's so summery
and the next thing that I got is very
similar to that previous top so it's
that same stretchy material except adds
a tie down the middle and it's again off
the shoulder but it's all black and
crops and love it so again you guys see
my dilemma because it's not gonna be
that hot in LA it's only gonna go up to
like 70 degrees some days and then the
other days it's just gonna be like in
the 50s and 60s so I definitely two
layers I like bought also we're closed
also I'm getting really sidetracked but
I love sets out talking to videos cuz I
love talking to you guys if you guys
have been following this channel and saw
my weekend in my life or following my
vlog channel at which by the way
subscribes that I am officially moving
to LA this summer so I will be there for
the summer so I'll only be there for two
and a half months but I am so beyond
excited like it's literally been a dream
of mine to move to LA in the summer and
I'm going to LA like in general but
maybe mainly just for a summer to like
test it out to see if I like it because
you guys know New York has my heart but
I like la to say has seriously been such
a dream align and the fact that it's
coming true is unbelievable and I want
to thank you guys because it's literally
what a hundred percent because of you
like 100 percent so just want to thank
you guys and you guys will definitely
see me sporting these looks in LA this
summer help me feel up there again
because I'm so excited so we'll be going
there for spring break I'll be going
there for a Coachella because I am
flying into LA and then I will be there
for two and a half months in the summer
so I'm just like a West Coast girl this
year
and the next thing that I got is this
super colorful romper or jumpsuit and it
is really a really cool and it goes all
the way down to the floor and it's
striped and just like such fun colors I
feel like these colors remind me of
Mexico or like Puerto Rico or something
like that look a little more tropical
because they're not too bright but
they're still like fun colors so it just
like is so so pretty and it reminds me
of going to the beach with my family
picture
your tan and you just got out of the
shower and you're not even thinking
about drying your hair with a blow dryer
because it's already hot outside so it
doesn't matter and you just feel so like
refresh and like your skin's a little
hot from being in the Sun and then
you're going out to dinner with your
family and it's just like still like 80
degrees at night that just sounds so
amazing okay back in my day dreams and
the last tooth clothing items that I got
are these two items so it's a set
actually so it's kind of like a business
where except I feel like it's like
inspired by business wear because I
actually wouldn't wear this to work the
super cute shorts wit so it's like a
peach color like a neutral beige peach
color with white stripes so I gotta be
tan when I wear this so I don't blend in
with the color also the blazer that
matches with it I love it I think it's
so elegant and classy and just a really
really cute look and I'm obsessed with
two-piece sets those are like my
favorite things to wear especially in
the summer I think they're so so cute
and the next few things that I think
would look so cute with that outfit are
these accessories so the first thing is
this purse and I like it because it's
completely clear so this little bag on
the inside is removable so you don't
have to actually have this bag but I
think it makes it look cute so if you
want to wear it as like a totally clear
transparent bag you can and then the
next thing is this set of necklaces so
it is these star necklaces that are
draped like not like a choker but like a
little looser than a choker I think
they're so cute and it's another rose
gold item so I really really love it
last but not least the last item that I
got are these really cool shoes so they
are just sandals with like a maybe one
inch heel super tiny and they are all
black and so like the most basic shoe
but one that you can wear like basic in
a good way like you can wear these shoes
with anything and they're so elegant I
think I just think they're like a very
classy summer shoe if that makes sense
I'm excited to wear those during in the
summer or during spring
like it once it's like it's 70° and yeah
I gotta get my toes done first though so
that being said all of these things are
from Windsor so be sure to check them
out and I will have all the links down
below if you guys want to shop these
items and let me know again where you're
going for a spring break so really hope
they guys enjoyed this video I feel like
it was such a short video except it says
that it was how is this 17 minutes long
I swear I talk and talk and talk and it
literally it feels like it's like a
minute and then I look and it's like 30
I have a problem I really hope that you
guys enjoyed this video as much as I
enjoyed filming it and shopping for a
hit tonight I gotta put all these stuff
away but really hope you enjoyed and I
will see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
