Renner you a let's get into the video
the first word that i have is adore me
and you guys know this for my other
holes I've shown them previous Paul's
like the pictures of them I just really
really love the site it's a monthly
membership so that I guess is why I
really like it you get me to sing every
single month it comes with a bra and
underwear set which is it's awesome the
only a bra underwear Z has bathing suit
save sweet where so yeah I am getting
bathing suits for this month to get the
summer so I got a few baby seats from
then this month you get out of your
contract whenever you want you can sign
up whenever you want to believe
program you don't even have to do a
monthly you don't want to you can just
buy it what I really want like if you
just want a random over mirror or gonna
be so you can totally do that it just is
more expensive first x 2500 such an
amazing use a victoria secret $25 won't
even get you like half a bra vs i got
men is this purple bathing suits i think
is super cute so this is what it looks
like it's just a triangle purple baby
suit and the back is really cool i
really like the strapless of the back
and the bottoms are just regular tied at
the size boxes the next bathing suit I
got from bev is my favorite it is just a
white one-piece bathing suit and I'm
obsessed with one pieces I didn't want
to start getting more of that as soon as
it was back because i don't like want
pieces that are just plain one piece
nothing special to it so like this one
has an open back and like a cool design
on the back so it's not just like a
plain white what piece did i say to that
i got from that I also move to a picture
of and it is this the bottoms are just
plain black bottoms but the top you guys
so this is what it looks like I'll
obsessed with high neck top it's like a
mesh mesh highlight and if I'm like a
bandeau Styles around your boobs make
sure to check them out I want all my
downloads the next one I'm going to show
you guys is going to be for everyone I
have fool in love forever 21 but I never
go shopping in prayer
actually in this store I always go
online shopping because I just cannot
handle the madness that is inside for
parsing that is this retard and it is
one of these things I didn't love these
inside it looks very plain back how's
that like criss cross pattern on it I
love it try to get more into colors by
knowledge is where lips black white gray
and brown look beige so trying to get
more into like the color Holdings next
thing that I got is this a white top
it's this off the shoulder kind of like
a valley girl I would describe it as
chalk this is what it looks like Assam
crochet detailing and it's a little bit
see-through but I just love that is off
of the shoulder very 70s like Coachella
inspired the next thing I got referred
to me one was under ten dollars and I
love it it is this high-neck dress it is
just a plain black dress but I think
this is such a good layering piece and
you can literally do any style both with
this I might do a video like 1 items 10
outfits or something like that let me
know if you guys want me to because i
might do either one of these or a
t-shirt dress for brandy melville the
next thing that I got was this other not
a dress it's kind of kind of weird I
know I really relate to on the website
so it looks like a maxi dress right here
but it actually opens up so you go to
wear like shorts or some things it's
open in the front and yeah I'm a social
Cuban heels all the way down to the
floor and I'm really excited
sorry I think it is so trendy and I
definitely see stuff like this and
snappy our urban for a lot more
expensive and love apart from Wanda
quality is really good and it's really
cheap and the last thing I've at first
we want is this bathing suit where I
thought this bathing suit which is
really really cool this is another hi
matt van zue as you guys can see it's a
super high neck at all at one tone it's
a little metallicy and then the back is
like an open criss cross back and then
the bottom or we look extremely small so
like I'm gonna have to stretch it with
these strings right now the strings are
still like really far down so I got
stretched out like it's just looks
extremely tiny the next I'm gonna show
you guys is wrong way is this chalk I
can get a super cute i saw it online and
i just like to be loose bits of it so
it's a v-neck and it's super loose foot
crops in a little boxy so it looks a lot
better on but yeah I love this with Deb
shorts or white jeans I think it's
really good summer go to you and I got
this two-piece set I'm obsessed is this
core up top and these shorts and I think
that this is the cutest I look so good
together and it's just the perfect
summer go to you literally photos fine
it feels like you're wearing pjs but
it's so much cuter and I Phillips knows
very very expensive I got a shirt just
as white blouse it's very loose and thin
instead of Venus
and it came with these strange to make
it criss cross the next one after the
guys is posh square and I actually can
give away with them so this they sending
out some pus and they felt on me I ought
to do a giveaway for them with you guys
so that makes me really really excited
so I'm not going to put in the
description that I'd to get away because
i want the real OG viewers to see this
and then be informed it was secret
getaway so that not the whole world can
see it and just clicked on it just
because it's good way so I want you guys

that before you met her I'm just gonna
show you what I got to this website I am
obsessed with their website and all of
those are so cute I got the person I
thought is this super hot paint and
dress and this is actually all suede
material and it like house one of those
that kind of cut out if you guys can see
I feel Barney in this but it's actual
Barbie and i just am obsessed with it so
thank you so much for saying this stuff
to me because it shows with you and I
don't own a single thing even remotely
similar to this in my closet so I like I
absolutely love this dress and again
like I said I'm trying to branch out and
be more colorful so this is definitely a
huge step in being more colorful the
next thing that happened that is this
wrong birthdays on Roberts actually
jumpsuit the straps are releasing and
black agenda like and then it is just a
kind of reddish orange jumpsuit and it's
an incredibly thin like house eating
material the legs and goes all the way
down to the floor I think this is so so
summery and absolutely perfect for the
beach or just like at night on the town
I love it the next thing that I got from
matt is this other leotard I really like
new charts like onesies and I'm various
call them in it's a black t-top and I
have that crisscross material at the top
I'm just I love it I've seen sit with us
at urban brandy all those places and I
sure like this one super soft and I just
offense of one piece because like I says
one of my sisters so easy you don't have
to come taka days already tucked in for
you so yeah I'm going taking those this
summer the next door that I got stuck at
is urban outfitters and I actually don't
think I got much from urban she thinks
we're not miners and first one is this
bralette and this look I'm so surprised
that my boobs into this because it
looked so credible tiny but the back is
like really pretty side and I think this
is key to wear with it open and back the
last thing that I got ever happens is
this tank top and it looks really weird
with not on you I'm gonna try to kind of
show you the best check yeah I'll just
open my screen captures and in the back
of it it's like a little tea the next
door is my favorite store and I got it
some stuff from free people my sister
actually bought some stuff for me for my
birthday so I'm showing that now after
saying this bag and it is the perfect
summer bag
sure i'm looking for like summer first
and think I thought this year so this is
it it as a fringe hanging from it and he
chose her cuteness long and you where
it's a crossbody but it's still likes
big enough to put whatever I need I
don't really like hearing that many
things go back to what's in my purse day
seemed like everyone's bad was Mary
Poppins that next thing I got 40 is this
tim top this was only twenty dollars
which i'm impressed because I feel like
everything it for people's at least a
few dollars but it is just a plain tank
top so that sense is this plain green
tank top I really like the color of it
and I like it it's because it's an open
back so I can totally run a system
bralette I think that would be really
really cute together and I just like
wearing basics versa the next and I got
in that store called The Bella
I'm not sure if they had it all the
interest in the carolina area got this
oversized kind of carolina's blue which
i go to NC State but I really likes
color on you guys it's like a sky blue
t-shirt kind of liked Irish season
making wear with a bra let very many but
it's like v-neck used it as of the next
step that's all my clothes Xena keys the
next thing that a lot is probably most
exciting thing and I want to be kinda
general if gift I'm some such services
because I was merely of like set an
alarm on my phone for when they restock
because I had to go so I got two of them
I gotta go cocaine which is actually
what I'm wearing right now advanced can
see I love it but I honestly under which
and I like more cocoa games very more
pinky but candy canes more like a pinky
ring dish color the next one I just that
is victoria secrets and I shot there's
more athletic so I haven't wanted to get
some tour secret leggings from their ass
website i always get pink sports bra so
they never get Tory a secret stuff so no
my friend is not some things see we're
going to half off all their legs that's
like an incredible beautiful i bought
these for twenty dollars so i stopped
moving variety and yeah they just plain
grey athletic eight and then i got
sports bra from there this works we're
going to go back to the route is cool
materials time I jersey material and
then it crosses in the back and what I
like about this is that it's elastic or
inelastic its own adjustable because a
lot of course girls are not adjustable
but not like a brother it's the latter
sports broth nostril see how can I made
it a testable and then the last one that
I gotta join these funniest links
