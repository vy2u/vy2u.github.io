fashion haul for you guys and this is
one huge haul and I did not buy this all
at once trust me it would I don't think
I'd be able to buy this all at once
there's a lot of clothes by I bought
this starting some like the end of
January to about last weekend I guess
that's the span of all of these clothes
which is still a lot because that's not
that big this pants like three months
about um but yes so this is a lot of
clothes it's a lot of spring clothes I'm
just gonna get started because and I
just wanted to do a haul for you guys
because I'm obsessed with hauls I love
watching them I love filming them I love
shopping in order to make hauls like
everything about the whole process and
everything about hauls in general I very
much enjoy so I'm just going to get
started and yeah I hope you guys enjoy
these spring/summer finds that I found
and let me know if you guys have any
hauls or spring fashion trends just
comment below leave me a better video
response I love watching your video
responses they're really cool and like I
just like seeing like who watches my
videos you know but yeah so let's get
started first story just victory on the
bag I'm going to start with Abercrombie
which features a shirtless guy on the
bag of course I only got one thing I've
ever crummy and this is probably one of
my favorite bag this is probably one of
my favorite things I got is this Mick
green shorts and you guys cannot see the
beauty of the color from camera and I'm
gonna be saying that a lot with a lot of
things I got so a lot of things you
cannot see the beauty up but these
high-waisted mint green shorts are the
cutest things ever I'm obsessed with
them and I just really really love them
and I'm going to be wearing these a lot
this summer and the fact that it's mint
green plus high-waisted
just makes them my my absolute favorite
shorts that I own the next story is a
very similar story to ever come he is
all sir would you wanna comment pictures
the valley shirtless guy okay um some
high-waisted shorts from there as well
um kind of a short a holic you guys are
gonna be able to tell I've got a lot of
shorts okay so I bought these
high-waisted shorts I post a picture on
Instagram with the outfit I bought from
Hollister which I'll show you the shirt
later um but yeah I got these
high-waisted shorts they're light wash
cuffs in distress and then they come
with this absolutely adorable bow you
guys it actually came with it and I
think these are like fifty dollars
turtle yeah these shorts were like 50
bucks and I thought that was a pretty
good deal honestly for Hollister because
one in high-waisted and highway sets of
shorts are expensive bezel cut is and it
comes with a belt so I just thought that
was a great deal and I was really
excited to find these the shirt that
came with it earlier that I bought with
it like I put it together it wasn't like
on the mannequin together or anything
is this crop top this is my favorite
shirt that I've bought like ever it is
so cute I posted the picture of me
wearing this shirt with their shorts on
Instagram so check out my Instagram at
Natalie underscore barboo it's super
cute it's just like a really really
flowy white crop top take a top thing I
can't weigh this with I can't wait to
wear this in the summer and then it has
the crochet material all throughout the
bottom of it so I just thought that was
super cute and I am obsessed with the
shirt and it was like 25 dollars I
believe so it wasn't really that bad
the next shirt I bought was this other
crop top from Hollister it's also white
I'm kind of obsessed with white clothes
you're gonna be able to tell I mean it's
white and it has this material I don't
know what to call this material it's
like flowers but it's see-through so
I've already worn this with a colorful
BAM dough underneath I think that looks
super cute and I just really really
liked that shirt so yeah that is all I
got from Hollister now let's move on to
like Urban Outfitters yeah that's them
that sounds good Urban Outfitters I went
twice to Urban Outfitters show I'll show
you what I got
of the times this is the time I went
much recently I got this really cute
shirt I don't have anything like it so I
once I saw I had to have it it is this
collared tank top and button out so this
colored button-down tank top and it has
this really really cute like sequiny
flower pattern all throughout it so it
just reminds me kind of like the old urn
style I don't know it's I think it's
super cute I would have button it all
the way up and you can if you want but
that's just not me so I'm gonna leave
some of it unbuttoned and I like how
it's kind of like not like a muscle tank
or anything but it just like doesn't
have sleeves and then it has a little
like collar and I thought that it was
just so cute and I liked how the back
and the material is like a t-shirt so
it's not like really fancy or anything
and I cannot wait to wear this the other
time I went to Urban Outfitters I bought
a few more things but not much I bought
these pairs of shoes um I already won
these like 10 times like within 7 days
of wearing them I wore them about five
times you can wear these with anything I
was obsessed with these shoes urban up
the Urban Outfitters this is very get
miss so much to use when it comes to
this summertime just cuz they have some
really cute finds and they're not
expensive at all I think these are like
30 or 40 bucks so it's not bad they're
just like this like material I don't
even know what just carats like leather
but I don't know what this like knitting
is and they're just super cute like
shoes you can wear them ashore with
dresses you can wear the skirts I've
worn them with all three I mean like
these are just really really cute shoes
that you can wear with anything so she
comes in each and then I got some Bandos
from Urban Outfitters commandos are
essential I have a cream one that I
think is in the wash and then I have
this purple one I just love this color I
think it's a really really vibrant
purple and I think it's just really
really pretty and Purple's were my
favorite color so this is super cute and
they're only twelve dollars actually
sixteen dollars but they're lace so
they're really really pretty but also I
got this shirt at Urban Outfitters and
it's just a crop top tank top here I'll
show you guys do you see you I'm saying
it's tried right here so and it's like
kind of cropped and yeah
duh hey now it's you hmm
first thing I gotta h-net was this dress
so it's just as super cute it is this
really gorgeous gray blue color and I
really like the pattern at the top of it
I don't know it's kind of like like
see-through detailing but yeah it's just
really cool and then I have this like
pleated bottom of a not only pleated but
like that material I'm really bad at
describing clothes if you can't tell and
then it's a high-low which I really like
and then the next thing plus the last
thing I oughta hmm was this plaid shirt
and you're gonna think why didn't you
buy this for the spring but I think if
you're wearing with shorts you're
talking it with some high-waisted shorts
it'd be really cute it's this super thin
quarter sleeve shirt and it kind of is
like the reverse alright it fades into
darkness so yeah I was just really I
liked the grunge enos of this shirt and
I just thought I could wear this with a
lot of things in the spring and in this
winter when it needs it's like cold
outside so yeah I just got this because
I don't have anything like it and I just
thought it was super cute and like
grunge edgy like really my style
next door is pretty secret and I got one
thing from there I got a baby suit pop I
only get tops because I have a lot of
bottoms especially and I had like a lot
of bottoms that have different colors on
them so I can wear tops with anything I
bought this banjo top and it's a really
really pretty blue I don't know how to
describe the blue obviously as like
shocker how I don't know how to describe
something and it has like ruffles I
don't know I really liked it I liked how
it looked on and I like how it's not
clip at the end you just like tie it
yourself because I love that when you
tie it yourself because then you can
adjust how tight or loose you want it so
I thought that was really neat next door
is going to be Marshall's
I have not been to Marshalls in forever
but my friend was like hey they have
Free People stuff at Marshall and just
trying it on my three people and it was
like what I love all three people is my
obsession
so I went to Marshalls with her
discover some free people things she
said there wasn't that many for people
there as in Iran normally yes normally
they have like a large variety of free
people but there was only a few things
but I picked something up so I got this
crop top it's a hot not hot pink it's a
bubblegum pink color I thought the color
was so cute it's actually like a baby
pink baby pink / bubblegum pink but I
really like how its crochet I mean this
is kind of like the net like I don't
know it might seem kind of like a waxed
penny but yeah and it's super cute it's
a crop top and as you can tell I'm
obsessed with crop tops and they have
this in white also and I love the white
one I liked the white one more than the
pink but I don't have any color in my
closet you guys like I do but I don't
have that much so the next thing I got
at Marshall's is this nautical romper
and I really really liked it because
it's a romper and it looks like a dress
but it's not what else that would be
really really short and it has this like
big ruffles at the bottom and then it
just tight at the top and it has these
buttons that come down it and then
following to ruffles and it was just
very like sailor it reminded me of like
I feel like you could wear this as a
Halloween costume but I will definitely
be wearing this in the summer I just
think it's so cute I love rompers and I
absolutely adore the nautical style you
know Marshalls elf warm eyes the little
black book that little black baby book
and it was the warm Edition and a lot of
beauty tutorials I have seen there
haven't been using this and I really
like the way they turned out so I
figured it's pretty good quality if all
these tutorials are turning out really
well so I picked one up myself and
employee five dollars you guys compared
to eight so I didn't like get that much
of a steal but I'm very excited to use
this and I will definitely be using
tutorials doing tutorials with this if I
end up liking it if I don't like it
forget it I'm not gonna use the
tutorials and I wasted five bucks oh
well door it's BP Nordstrom and first
thing I got is this cream top shocker
and it's crochet and lace another
shocker Wow not only raw cream crochet
lace top not that I don't have 50 of
those in my closet okay but I got this
one and let me tell you this is my
favorite shirt in my closet I
and obsessed with it it has the
crocheted detailing at the top and then
it goes into lace and then also have
some crochets in the middle of the lace
and then some of this in the middle of
lace and it is just so cute you guys
I've already worn it and I absolutely
adore it I've worn this with my nude
with my nude bando from Urban Outfitters
which was also lace the next shirt I got
you guys will peer into your soul look
at this oh my gosh tell me this is not
the most adorable thing you've ever seen
here's a giant cat and not only is it a
cat it's a kitten and it's a very very
cute kitten look look at it it's so cute
so I think just I'm just need to hold
this up and that explains why I got it
that's the reason I got that shirt no
more explanation needed and oh my gosh
you guys first time I ever been to live
yeah first time a beauty guru has ever
been to lush do you hear those words
often I don't think guys I don't think
you've ever heard those words because
every beauty thing's gonna suck okay so
oh my god
describe it's a cupcake scrubs for oily
skin I just decided to try it it's
actually no scrub I don't know why I
keep saying that it's a mask
it's cupcake mask that really does smell
like chocolate and then I got a similar
sea salt sprays and I just said it's try
one out so good got sea salt spray was
only twelve dollars so I will let you
know if I like it I haven't tried this
yet so already is no I like it yeah
that's all I got it lush oh my gosh you
guys are you guys ready for this big old
bag of American Eagle
because I work at American Eagle I get
an employee discount I'd go crazy
because I shop shop shop shop stop you
guys please don't judge me of all the
clothes I have behind since I've worked
there first things first this is my
favorite thing I bought from there it's
this really pretty dress I've already
worn it twice in a matter of three days
so that says a lot but yeah it's very
very colorful and I its inches at the
waist with this like material my design
and it's just like a tie-dye but not
really tie-dye colourful dress that is
adorable
and then it crisscrosses in the back so
needless to say I and I wore it to my
birthday dinner last night so if you
guys want to check that out on Instagram
you can see how it looks on okay and I
kind of went crazy with the bathing
suits not gonna lie I bought like five
pairs bathing suits
okay so first bathing suit I bought was
this fringe bathing suit I really like
fringe um actually my sister bought this
but again I really like how it's a tie
and it's not clicks I don't really like
Clips and bathing suits but yeah I got
this bathing suit and it's super cute
and it's strapless and yeah I love it
and then to match the bottoms of that
bathing suit I bought these which match
the bottom of it as you can tell the
colors go and it's like super small and
kind of annoying stretch these out cuz
these are my little sisters but we like
wear the same stuff even though she's
sick five years younger with me very sad
yeah I know
she's already taller than me guys okay
but um next bathing suit I got is this
very plain purple one then BAM the back
is not so plain anymore it has three
straps and it's kind of an awkward tan
line I'm gonna kind of like it at the
same time you know yeah yeah I got
bottoms to match with it these bottoms
they're purple with like the neon pink
thing another baby say oh my gosh with
water shocker I got this one from airy
and it's like a tie it's kind of like my
dress except with different colors and
this one is like a halter so yeah I like
the Sun and this one has a clip okay
guys so my camera died in the middle of
filming so that is why the lighting is
so screwed up right now because I just
wanted to finish this video today this
is the second time I have refilmed this
video so I was not about to do it again
and I had postponed this video for so
long all these facts have been sitting
in my room for a week so I just needed
to get this video over with so the
lighting is absolutely horrendous I am
so sorry about that
and I'm chewing gum in my viewers hate
when I chew them so long he's wrong with
okay so it's probably go so that's not
gonna be annoying
okay so I'm just going to finish the
video before my camera dies again let's
turn officer shorts I have these white
shorts and that have like the beading
around here and the lighting is horrible
so you can't really tell that well but
yeah these are the festival shorties and
these are my by far my favorite type of
shorts the festival shorties are nothing
they fit me really really well they
don't fit everyone well but they fit me
like perfectly so this isn't my favorite
shirt another pair of festival shorties
this is my red ones and of course you
cannot see the color that well but they
are maroon um I'm really I apologize so
terribly about this lighting my lighting
my room sucks but yeah and then they're
just distressed and I try to get a good
lighting yeah they're just a distressed
pair of maroon shorts and then I have
some dark denim ones that are rolled so
I have these also and these I have worn
about 30 times just cuz they're a
classic and I think everyone needs
season these are the midis so you can
wear them at school you can wear them to
work you can wear them wherever you want
I can wear Middies to work I can't wear
shorties so if that's a good thing
Oh guys it's another bathing suit oh
gosh okay so I had this I think this is
the Juliet yeah this is the Juliet and
it's just like kind of like a strapless
pushup
it doesn't push it off that much don't
worry but um yeah I really like it
except it has a clip and this is from
Arry it's not from American Eagle and
then you can add straps if you want but
it's just a very solid gray and that's
what I liked about it cuz I don't I oh I
only have colorful bathing suits so I
wanted a really classic so
great one so this one was perfect more
sorts these pink ones oh good this is a
really good place of light because you
can actually see the pink so do you see
it's beautiful pink color this beautiful
pink color this is my favorite pair of
shorts makes you look super tan and it's
a corduroy material but it has like
little like like distressed miss at the
bottom of it but these are by far my
favorite shorts they are a pastel like
light pink and they're so cute guys I
love them and then I have another pair
of midis that I got and these are a
light wash so it's like a just a light
wash pair that's kind of distressed as
well and roll up but they're mini so I
can wear them everywhere yay
and last thing is Steve Madden I got one
pair of boots there you guys are
thinking why in the world did you get
boots in the summer and I'm sorry mr.
talkie why in the world do you get boots
in the summer
um because they're these super cute ones
so why wouldn't I get boots in the
summer or the spring time because you
can wear these are shorts and then you
can still stay cool so they have like
the net material right here
so I can keep you cool you know and that
I love how it has like the buckle
material over here and then they're
brown and you can't really tell but
honestly all you can see is the necklace
to really love it but it's just kind of
like a worn out Brown like it has some
light spots has some darker spots it
just looks like it's been worn a bunch
of times and it's only been worn zero
times I have not yet one of these so
yeah I love these shoes and they smell
like new shoes I love the new shoes
