am filling in my very first back school
video of the year so I'm so excited
about that I know I'm not excited
because it's back to school I kind of am
because not going to lie I am so ready
to go back to school and I was thinking
if you guys go to college and you're not
excited to go back to school at least a
little bit I feel like you chose the
wrong school but that's besides the
point this video is me back to school
hall and I love filming these so you're
new here please be sure to subscribe
I have college videos I've been posting
throughout the entire summer so you guys
can totally check those out and thank
you guys for being very understanding
with my random schedule posting the past
few weeks now but without further ado
let's get into it again the first door
that I'm going to show you guys is a
very very basic store and it's not like
oh my gosh the cutest stuff but I love
it and it is brandy melville when I was
in saying there was brandy there so I
kind of got some things there and I'm
excited to show you guys them the first
thing I got is an extremely basic white
sweatshirt I just think that this was so
comfortable they only have one size as
you guys know so I believe this one was
just like a little oversized that they
made it and it's so soft on the inside
and I just really really like plain
white fletcher's we're just playing
Fletcher's in general again like I said
it's not like high fashion but it's
completely comfortable the next thing I
got is two of these same shirts and the
first one I got was this kind of blueish
I don't know what type of blue this is
called I don't know a indigo so it's
like a Riggs I think that's what the
material distraction material is called
and I got it in blue and I also got it
in red I got a lot a lot of red pieces
of clothing one because I've really
liked the color red on clothes as you
guys can though and also because my
school I go to NC State it's the main
colors are red and black and I was
thinking for tailgate season these would
be really really cute and I really don't
like the classic tailgate season
clothing like a lot of girls just wear
the dresses and cowboy boots and that's
just not me I started to pick up some
different red pieces
I guess not as I don't know like country
southern I only wearing this a lot and I
really really like them because I
they're super comfortable super raising
the next article of clothing that I got
with this other ribbed take top and but
this one actually is a tank top and I
really really do like it super
comfortable I wear this to the beach
this weekend and it's just really like a
casual tank top so you can just throw on
put on with jeans or denim jacket with
like white shorts or anything at all I
really like it because you can throw it
on with literally anything and again
it's red so I will definitely be able to
wear that to football games as I keep
like pulling clothes out of the pile I'm
realizing I literally got so many red
gloves the next one I got is this other
tube top and it is red surprise on an
adjacent piece that you can throw on
with a lot of different things
I wore this actually in Europe so I will
insert a picture instead of a video of
me wearing I'm just going to get all my
red clothing out of the way for you guys
not just yeah okay anyway next shirt
that I got with this shirt and I think
it is off the shoulder I haven't worn it
yet but I love off the shoulder pieces
and I like it because the top of it it
doesn't it's like cut so I don't know
it's like when you cut a t-shirt it
doesn't have a seam or anything like
that like this one has like a seam to
top this one doesn't the next year I
thought is the same structure is the
first one except it has a different
material so again it's the red shirt
that is off the shoulder but it has more
of a stretching material I guess I would
say and that's it for my red clothing
guys I promise no class and you get this
thing that I got is this blue tank top
from them and I really really like it
because it's one a nice color is blue
and I like it because it's a little
thicker hand gets crossed off but it's
buttoned all the way down and it's very
nautical because of the blue and white
stripes I just haven't seen a shirt like
this and I think it's super cute to wear
with like a skirt or jeans or anything
like that at all
also if you guys don't know my
boyfriend's is - UNC is that some of the
blue pieces that I got I could wear to
his games and stuff like that apply I
liked both of those obviously I got way
more red but you know just so that I can
have a little bit of both the next thing
I got are these shorts and I was
actually surprised at how much I loved
these shorts because I am in a dilemma
you guys I'm just going to point you
might women where I have been
working out with on more but I've
actually been gaining weight which I'm
not like upset about at all because I've
been gaining a lot of muscle but I have
been getting weight and my legs have
gotten bigger and my buttons gotten
bigger
so my pant size now is just pedal over
the place like I kind of say in some
eyes all the shorts setting you stab but
I still should go size up but sometimes
the size up is a little too big on me so
it's just been this weird phase where I
don't know really what shorts to wear
because they're either too tight and my
buttons hanging out or they're too big
and they're very baggy and when I sit
down they're just like all baggy and
gross so yeah that's it you guys have
that same problem let me know but
insurance apprising Lee I really like
they were nice and tight at the hips or
like at the waist but for my butt in
like hips area it wasn't super super
tight and I didn't have to keep pulling
them down because for me I love American
Eagle shorts and all my shorts are from
American Eagle but every time I wear
them I have to pull them down and then
it's just uncomfortable so yeah I really
really liked these white shorts and now
the stuff that I absolutely love and
cannot wait to show you guys so I did it
my fair share of shopping while I was in
Europe so yeah I'm just going to dive in
and show you guys everything that I got
the first things that I got are these
jeans from Zara and they are so cute and
so I was having a huge sale and they're
just like playing jeans but then at the
bottom they actually have this like
flare at the very very bottom of the
ankle I think they're so European
they're so cute I love the way that they
fit they're not very stretchy but I do
like the way that they say they were
only 13 euros you guys which is so cheap
because ara was having a huge sale and I
love Zara and that we don't saw her
anywhere that I live so yeah I had to go
sorry the next thing that I got from
Zara
was my favorite thing I think that in
this whole entire haul and it was only
$29.99 euros so probably not only $30
$35 I want to say and I think it's like
$35 I don't know it's almost one to one
ratio but not quite so it is this Flair
suede jacket and normally when you see
these like suede or like super flare
Fuji jacket or blazer is fringe jackets
then they're really accepted
- like $200 or something like that but
this one I had to get it I know it's not
summer at all but you know I will be
wearing this next year or like in the
winter like crazy or in the fall I think
it is perfect I love it so much I love
the color and on the material I love the
style and I love the price the next
thing that I got is from Urban
Outfitters and I wear this in Barcelona
and it is this jumper it's super wrinkly
basically just straight out of my
suitcase but it is this jumper and it's
kind of like a MIDI length I went to
supply Adidas sneakers and I thought it
was really really really cute on and I
just love love love
jumpers and super flared throughout and
yeah I thought with the sneakers it gave
it a really cool casual vibe and the
next thing I got is from American Eagle
and these shorts again like I was saying
my shorts dilemma so I got these in a
size up from what I normally wear and
they fit in pretty well again there are
little tighter than what I would want
but they still do fit me well so I got
these because American people like those
shorts are just so great I love American
Eagle shorts and all other shorts I feel
like are very very expensive like if I
go to Nordstrom and trying to find a
pair of shorts they're just so expensive
and I can't seem to like be able to give
that amount of money for just a pair of
denim shorts so let me know your
favorite places to shop for shorts if
you guys are going through the exact
same thing or just good pendants to shop
for shorts that won't make me broke and
then the next door that I went to was
actually in Costa Rica when I went to
visit my best friend in Costa Rica and
we went to some sort code pool in there
I have never heard of it before but she
has what's on me that I call over there
and it's really really cute and really
cheap I think of it kind of as like a
forever 21 but a little nicer and so
yeah the stuff that I got the prices you
guys you're going to be I was impressed
I got all of this for $20 so keep that
in mind it's only three things but three
things for $20 is pretty so the first
thing I got and this denim dress and I
really really like it or kind of like
fake denim dress and I like it just
because of the ruffles and it's off the
shoulder it's like a one of those column
when the shoulder is cut off
I forgot what those cool I really liked
how the ruffles go and I just
so really really cute summer and drop
the next thing that I got from there is
a really good shirt for going out at
night and it was only three dollars you
guys was so cheap but it is this light
blue kind of like a Carolina blue color
see-through shirt and yeah I'm going to
wear this is a black 4ls underneath and
maybe some black jeans and booties I
think that would be really cute but I've
really been loving the seater shirt it
seemed a lot Orban Outfitters but again
they're really expensive and I don't
like spending that much money on clothes
the next and last thing that I actually
got oh actually not the last thing I see
something over there that I didn't put
in my file the last thing I got from
this store is this dress and it's
definitely different I was debating on
getting out of my friends like I think
that you like it and if you don't it's
super super cheap so just get it anyways
it is a white shirt with this like
see-through mesh dress um and I really
love the style of it so or it's a sweat
dress I guess and the dress like the
white dress attorney stops but it comes
all the way I think it's accompanied a
dress I thought it was super different
I've never seen anything like it in any
stores near me than where I live in the
u.s. but I really really liked it and
then I think that I got is this
interests or no it's a romper from the
store called mystique I do think the
seek is more in like the south but I
might be wrong
I really like the seek because it's
super cheap and super super cute so I
got this pink romper I fell in love with
the color and I have one big ruffle and
it's off the shoulder and then it's just
like a plain pinkish purple throughout I
really really really loved the color and
they were having a great sale so it was
just a good day and the next thing that
I got from this cake is this off the
shoulder top as get I love
off-the-shoulder things if you had can
tell most of these things have been off
the shoulder and I've been really loving
them so it's this kind of gray striped
shirt again the ruffle across and all
shoulder and it's not short-sleeved but
it's not quarters leaves kind of like in
the middle awkwardly cutting off your
arm but still can tabitha not leave the
next thing I got is this hat from brandy
I forgot to mention it but I love
baseball caps if you guys follow any of
my blogs I was wearing a baseball cap in
99% of them because I wear them all the
time at school they're just so easy to
throw on if you're having a bad hair day
like have bad skin or anything like that
like it's just so easy it's around a
baseball cap and I think they're really
cute so I got this one it says USA I
seriously love it so much
