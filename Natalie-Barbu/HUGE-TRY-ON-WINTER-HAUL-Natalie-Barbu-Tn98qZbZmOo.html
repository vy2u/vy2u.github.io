I am coming to you with a new video this
Friday so happy Friday you guys I am
filming a huge haul so this haul
includes a lot of sweaters it also
includes some random stuff like I got
some swimsuits just because they were
super cheap and really cute and like you
can never have too many bathing suits so
yeah I got some of that so that's not
really wintery but everything else is so
yeah this is basically like a winter
haul just a bunch of sweaters and really
cute things I haven't filmed a haul in
forever I don't even remember the last
haul I filmed and I loved filming these
videos so I'm really excited to show you
guys what I've got all this stuff is
from zappos.com
it's like one of those websites that has
really trendy clothes but for super
super super cheap so yeah I just kind of
went on a shopping spree there so all
the links will be down below because I
got these all really recently so they
should all still be up there if you guys
are new to my channel please be sure to
hit the subscribe button if you want I
post videos every Tuesdays and Fridays
every video I say Tuesday Thursday just
because like it sounds more natural
coming out of my mouth but it's Tuesdays
and Fridays guys ignore whatever I say
Tuesdays Thursdays I'll be hoping to hit
sixty thousand subscribers soon and I
just think that would be so cool so yeah
and also thumbs this video up if you
guys like hauls because I know that you
guys like them like I don't know if you
guys want any other videos let me know
in the comments below we are just gonna
get right into this haul the first thing
that I got I'm gonna show you because I
am actually wearing it so today I
decided to wear this purple sweater and
it's so cute it's one of those sweaters
that it has a choker attached to it and
it kind of shows your collarbones a
little bit so it is this purple sweater
and it has zippers on the sleeves so I
love it so so soft and purple it's like
my favorite color to wear I love that I
has the trochlear attached because those
are you guys who know me know I wear
chokers like every single day so yeah
just having one attached makes life a
lot easier
the next thing that I got is this denim
jacket and it is so so so so cute you
guys obsessed so it is this a big denim
jacket and it actually has one of those
like fur collars which I love I think
it's so trendy and it has fur all inside
too and it just like buttons down it's
super super thick and really really cozy
for the winter I
love it and I really wanted one but all
the ones that I saw were so expensive
and this was so cheap like I don't
remember all the prices but I'm pretty
sure nothing was like over 20 bucks like
everything was so cheap or maybe nothing
was over 30 but yeah so I'm obsessed if
you guys like this type of like style
let me know because I feel like this is
very much like a 90s style but yeah the
next thing I got is the sweater and it
is like a short little turtleneck
sweater and the turtlenecks a little
more loose and it's just a beige like a
knitted sweater I love wearing sweaters
they're just so easy to throw on over
leggings so that's why I buy as many as
I can and this one's really cute because
it kind of has like silver yarn kind of
like in it so this I don't know if you
guys can see if the camera is picking it
up but it glistens a little bit which is
really really cute but yeah I'm obsessed
with sweaters I wear them all the time
if you guys can't tell but the next
thing that I got is this shirt and I
kind of wish I got a bigger size but I
really like the whole like life of Pablo
shirts and stuff like that I see like
Kylie Jenner wearing them all the time
so I got a knockoff one honestly I'm not
the biggest fan of this one but it just
says Pablo on it I wish it was like in
cooler font but whatever this is just
gonna be a good shirt if I don't
actually wear it out and about I think
you'll be good to like layer under like
a big jacket or something like that or
also just wear it to sleep I don't know
it's so soft which is good but yeah so I
would recommend getting a larger size
that I did I'm pretty sure I got a
medium but what it is so the next thing
that I got is like my favorite thing
ever I'm gonna say that about a lot of
things so it is this Velvets like
midnight blue tank top it is so cute you
guys that the color already looks
gorgeous on camera so yeah it's just
absolutely gorgeous and it has lace at
the top and it's just all velvet in the
prettiest blue and it's so soft and like
so comfortable and I am obsessed with
this so this is gonna be so cute like
out and just like styling it I'm really
really excited about and now that I'm
thinking about it I honestly might wear
this to New York Fashion Week because
I'm so excited to say I'm going to New
York Fashion Week
I'm so excited planning outfits is gonna
be a little insane
I'm think I'm gonna go online shopping
even more this weekend I have a problem
I'm sorry guys but so yeah let me know
if you guys want me to do any videos on
that or I'm definitely gonna vlog it for
sure and like definitely in a phone an
outfit video but like I don't know if
you want other videos yeah so side now
avoid in New York Fashion Week and it's
gonna be like the best weekend of my
life but the next thing that I got is
this other sweater and this reminds me
of something I saw it
urban and I actually bought it at urban
and I was still waiting it for to come
in in the mail but I might return it
because I just got this one so this is
this like gray sweater and it has kind
of it's more like a poncho not really a
sweater and it has like a very large
neck hole and it's pattern and it's this
material that's like fuzzy but like long
hair I don't know how I would to
describe this material but yeah so it's
just like this really cute tribal poncho
thing but it's not a poncho because that
sleeves but it looks like a poncho
I don't know I'm the worst at describing
clothes and then it has a fringe at the
bottom the next thing that I got is this
other like sweater shirt thing so it's
black and then BAM the sleeves are white
and like huge bell sleeves I really like
this because it's like super high
fashion I feel like because the sleeves
are just big at the bottom of them it's
not like the whole sleeve but yeah so
it's just this black like a little
cropped sweater with super big sleeves
and I like the contrast of the white and
the black and I'm thinking of wearing
that to New York Fashion Week to let me
know what your favorite things are that
I got and tell me what I should wear to
New York Fashion Week and if you've ever
been to New York Fashion Week let me
know so I can know what to expect
because I've never been but I'm really
really excited the next thing that I got
is this other sweater so just like a
super soft knitted material but kind of
like the other black one
it also has bell sleeves but this time
it's not white it's all black and I like
this material a little more it's really
really thick and kind of just like
someone knitted it just this big black
sweater with bell sleeves and I think
it's so cute and high-fashion you guys
the fact that all of this I feel like
I've seen it like urban or even like
forever 21 or like other cute stores all
of these I've seen there and these are
always $20 they're so ridiculously cheap
and I know with some of these websites
you're kind of like I don't know if what
I see is what I get but so far I'm
telling you guys every
that I got is basically exactly what it
looks like on the website you guys can
click on the links below to compare them
but yeah I'm like really really really
really like two thumbs up for my
material for the material of all these
and for the way that they look and the
way that they fit like I'm really really
impressed with them and they are so
cheap but I don't know how many times I
want to say that but and the next thing
that I got is this other black like
dress and it's a sweater dress I mean it
has a big turtleneck and it's just this
black sweater dress these with over the
knee boots are my favorite so I make
sure to get like a small size because I
like them to be short because I'm short
so I have to have it like a super short
dress to wear over the knee boots to
show like that much skin um yeah
strategies I don't know if you guys do
that - if you guys are tall you're lucky
you don't have to worry about that
that's us short people do any of you
guys wondering I'm only 5 3 so yeah I'm
like really really short that I got it's
actually really funny so I got this like
mermaid blankets um so yeah it's one of
these like you guys have seen these all
over Twitter and Instagram and stuff
it's just one of these like mermaid tail
blankets it's a lot lot smaller than I
thought it would be it's like literally
like a skirt like a maxi skirt it's
actually like what it is especially
because it has a hole at the bottom so
like I can definitely wear this it's
like a Halloween costume but ya know
this is like a maxi skirt like it's not
very like stretch out or anything but it
is really cute I like the color and I
love like the mermaid blankets so I'm
excited it's a piece of clothing that I
got and the last piece of clothing
actually this haul is actually not gonna
be like too too long hopefully it is
this tank top and it's just a plain
white like knitted tank top I really
like this for the like going out at
night because it's a low or it's not a
low fee but it's like a v-neck it's
cropped you know you'll be cute in the
summertime especially what I'm saying
cuz it's white but I also soft tan so
like kind of tan all year round just
because I'm fake tan but yeah you guys
have a self tanning routine let me know
and I guess I got our very summery aloma
so if you ever warm weather places this
is definitely for you guys but I don't
but I still got them cuz they were
really cute and I saw them online so
this is my favorite swimsuit ever so is
this one piece but it's like all
tropical like like palm leaves or palm
branches and
it is so cute it's like dark green and
just a one-piece and on the side it
actually has oh and I really like the it
has like really really thick padding all
of one pieces I have don't have any
padding on the boobs and I'm just like
are my nipples just supposed to show
then it has this on the side so I like
that it has padding for my sake like if
you don't want padding you don't wear a
tank but like I kind of want padding and
the next day things see that I got is
basically the same thing because the
bottoms are kind of the same they're
like the green leaves on the bottoms and
they're really cute and then the top is
just a really cute like light pink top
and it's kind of like I don't know how I
feel about the cut of it but I'll see
you want to try it on because that's
like a really really big gap like
between your boobs but I'll see you and
then it just has like straps so it's
kind of like a tank top thing that I got
is this towel so it's not really a towel
it's not talent in you at all it's like
a tapestry so but it's for the beach I
think this is gonna be so cute when I go
to Florida for taking pictures so this
is what it looks like it's more like a
tapestry material it's definitely not
towel material whatsoever it's not like
water absorbent or anything but a little
cute for pictures and just like you can
still use it just like tanning obviously
so it's this big circular thing and I
think it's so so cute I can't even show
you everything my mirrors best ball
super bright pink and purple pattern and
then the last thing that I got actually
I forgot to have because it's in the
wash right now because I wore it the
first time I open the package but it's
this really cute denim jacket I'll show
a picture like right here it's a super
cute denim jacket and has patches and
fur on it and I'm obsessed with it I
actually also gave it to my friend to
borrow so yeah I'll post like pictures
and stuff here also I'm the worst
youtuber ever I got something that I
didn't show you guys though I already
put away like all my lights and
everything so I'm building on my blog
camera I got this shirt let me set this
down a huge huge mess I kind of like
this log style
okay so I got this shirt I had to show
you
because he's a French Bulldog and these
are like my favorite I love Bulldogs I
love pugs
I like anything with like a scrunchie
face so yeah French Bulldog t-shirt it's
just like a big gray t-shirt and I'm
obsessed with the sleeves rolled so yeah
I had to show you guys this because it
is a dog if it was anything else I don't
know if I would take the time to show
you guys but like this is one of the
things I was most excited about yeah
