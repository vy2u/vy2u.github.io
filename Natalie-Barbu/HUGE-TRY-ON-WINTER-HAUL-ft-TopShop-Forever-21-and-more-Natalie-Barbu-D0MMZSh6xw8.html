I am filming a winter haul for you guys
I'm so excited because it is the very
first haul of the season and I love
filming these for you guys I just want
to thank movement watches and sunglasses
for partnering with me on this video so
I will be showing you guys the stuff I
got from them but thank you so much I am
so stoked to show everyone the products
where I live right now it is currently
beyond freezing it's like 10 degrees
outside and I live in Charlotte North
Carolina
so it doesn't typically get this cold so
let me know where you guys live and how
cold is it or how warm it is and I will
be jealous but yeah let me know how what
the temperatures like where you guys
live because I love knowing that but
yeah it's just freezing cold over here

really know and be unsure but that is
what it is so join the Barbie dolls and
hit subscribe and be sure to thumbs up
also because that helps people find my
video and find my channel but without
further ado I'm just gonna get into the
hall so the first thing I'm going to be
showing you guys are the watches that I
got from movement so they are super
super cute I have recently been starting
to get into watches now because I do
wear my Apple watch but this is mainly
just worn when I work out so I'm really
happy to have actual cute watches to
wear with my outfits so this is the box
that it comes in super super sleek so
the first watch that I got is just this
classic light blue kind of like grayish
color it's like a it's a light blue but
it has hints of gray and I love the look
of it it's so simple and minimalistic
which is so mean and it's just so so
cute and has a gold details on it and
it's literally perfect like the perfect
simple classic watch I am obsessed with
it
also movement watches is all online so
if you guys want $15 off for your order
if you guys like any of these click on
the link down below but it's also all
online and it's so much cheaper than a
designer watch but it looks exactly like
a designer watch in my opinion then this
next watch that I got from
them his next one is so sick it is
seriously my favorite I was obsessed
with it when I saw it online so it is
this all-black watch it is so cool so
the face of it is black the face for the
other one was white so I like that this
one's different it doesn't really have
much of a contrast it's just like
straight black which I love the band is
also black and it has gold accents on it
so it is so freaking cute you guys I am
obsessed
especially because mainly the things I
wear are all black you guys will be able
to tell in this haul but I wear very
neutral and black color so I chose the
blue grey one just when I'm wearing more
of like wanting to add color to my
outfit but this one is just perfect for
everyday I think it's so so cute oh my
gosh movement also has sunglasses on
their site for way cheaper than
designers so be sure to check them out
you can get $15 off your purchase like I
said and click the link down below to
see everything else that they have but
yeah watches sunglasses so cute and it
seriously does look like it is a
designer and I just love how simple they
are that's like my favorite part of it
because you guys will even be able to
tell but in general my style is super
super simple like I wear plain colors I
don't like wearing like a lot of
patterns and anything like that like I
am very very like black white and gray
type of outfit the next thing I will be
showing you guys oh it's from 7 for all
mankind which is my absolute favorite
denim seriously I basically hate to
admit it because it is pretty pricey but
I like to only wear 7 for all mankind
because they fit me the best but you
gotta go when they have sales so I went
when they had 40% off and I got myself
two pairs of jeans the first one is this
plain black jeans they also have rips on
them and they're just super super cute I
really love them and I just needed a
pair of black jeans believe it or not I
didn't really have a great pair I had
one pair from brandy melville and like
brandy Melville is not a place that
sells denim it has like two sizes in
pants so like they obviously were not
the great it's quality they lasted me
for like a year and a half surprisingly
but they literally got so baggy by like
two hours into wearing them so
I got myself a pair of these and they're
so comfortable it feels like I'm wearing
leggings next pair of jeans I actually
have on so I'm gonna stand up and show
you these jeans they have like the two
tones on them super super cute
here's the look but yeah they have the
two tones on them which I really really
like so the side is black denim the
middle is a normal denim and they just
go down to your ankle I think they are
the perfect fit and seriously seven for
all mankind just fits my body perfectly
the next one I'm gonna be showing you
guys is Topshop and the first thing is
actually what I'm wearing again but I
got this shirt from there so it is just
this classic like graphic tee t-shirt
super super soft maroon color and it
says love yourself on it so I love that
I think it's so so cute and it's
definitely reminder to love yourself and
I like that it says like yeah not love
yourself look I just think it's so much
cuter I don't know why I just think that
it does thanks thing that I got from
Topshop is actually a huge fail and a
huge disappointment and I am planning on
returning it because it's like
unbelievable so I got this dress for New
Year's is a classic New Year's like
perfect dress it's beautiful I think I
love the shape of it I love that it
swoops at the neck everything is perfect
about it and the straps are super thin
as you guys can see but literally guys
these second I put it on like I didn't
even try it on at the store because I
was like oh I just know it fits me I
tried it on once at my house to make
sure I liked it but the outfit I was
wearing and then I tried it on when I
was getting ready for New Year's and
this is that like 8:00 p.m. on New
Year's Eve and the strap broke as I was
putting it on and it's because it's like
a swoop neck it's not one of those that
you can just wear strapless because it's
not tight at the top so like my boob was
just out and so I didn't know what to do
so my friend surprisingly had a sewing
kit in her room and we were staying at
her house so she gave me her sewing kit
and I learned how to sew that night and
it was all uneven but I had a leather
jacket so it was fine but yeah I just
think it's so unacceptable so poorly
made
I paid fifty five dollars for that dress
and for it to break the second I put it
on I think is ridiculous
the next thing that I got is this super
cute sweater from papaya so it is this
cute like kind of half turtleneck
sweater with zippers down the side and
it kind of reminds me of like a poncho
or something but it is so so cute and I
just love the color how neutral it is
and it's super super soft so yeah it's
just another good sweater to have the
next door I will be showing you is
forever 21 and I got a couple pieces
from there and you guys have seen these
clothes if you guys have been subscribed
to my blog channel and I've also posted
instagrams and all of these actually I
think it'll make two of them but I want
to show it on here because I have like a
different audience on here that I do my
blog channel like I have a much bigger
one on here but shout out to my blog
channel subscribe if you want um but I
wanted to show you guys because some of
you might not follow me on Instagram or
follow me on there and these things are
too cute and not to show so the first
thing that I got is this super cute
sweater kind of like a shirt sweater
from forever 21 and it's this mustard
yellow color which is definitely new to
my closet I don't own anything else this
color but the sleeves are bell sleeves
and they're like the tiered sleeves I
think that's what they're called so they
have three different lengths tiers and
yeah it's super super cute I'm obsessed
and the next jacket you guys have seen
on my Instagram and plenty of times I'm
sure but it is such a sick jacket it's
this jacket and it's like fake leather
or fake leather fake fur obviously it's
from forever 21 and it has this like
faux leopard print fur with white fur on
the arms and it's like a bomber jacket
though so that's why I love it because
it's so different than just like your
average for a jacket so it's a bomber
fur coat and it is so cool I feel like a
badass wearing it like I'm not even
kidding I think it's so cool and the
next thing I got from forever 21 is this
jacket and it's also kind of like it
looks like a denim jacket like the style
of it looks I feel like like denim but
it's not denim it's this I don't know
how to describe this material it's not
fur but it is kind of like that it's
like a lamb material feels like I'm like
petting a lamb that sounds so bad but
obviously it's not real but yeah so it
is this jacket it's all white with this
kind of soft material but it looks like
a leather jacket or a denim jacket the
style of it and I just think it's so so
cool and different and that's why I love
her to me wine because they have super
super trendy and in pieces and pieces
that you won't find anywhere else but
for so cheap so when this stuff goes out
of style it's not like I spent a bunch
of money on it and the next thing I want
to show is from Free People and you guys
have seen this all over my Instagram I
am sure of it but you guys I've never
gone so many questions about a coat in
my life so I wanted to put it on here so
you guys can know where it's from it's
this coat from Free People it's so so
soft it's this big teddy coat and it has
buttons down the side and it's just like
oversized big teddy coat keeps you so
warm I wore this in New York when it was
snowing and I still was not cold it's
literally the perfect coat oh my gosh
I'm obsessed it's so so soft and the
material is amazing it's just like my
all-time favorite winter coat and the
next winter item that I got is this big
puffy coat it's not like super stylish
or cute but it will keep me warm so it's
just this big puffy coat that I got for
when I'm walking to class and it's
freezing cold outside because I'm not
looking forward to that
and now I got some workout clothes I
want to show you guys these are from
fabletics which I love fabletics I think
they're actually really great quality
for being so cheap and so I got this
sports bras and leggings set but it's
super super cute so this is the sports
bra so it's a little ikat ink top I just
worn it by itself because it is long
enough and it has mesh at the top and a
little opening right above your right
about like your collar bones and it's
just a super super cool like metallic
key material and then the pants are the
same material so the leggings match with
it's and it's just a really really cool
set I've really liked it when I saw it
on the line and it fits perfectly you
guys I just poked myself in the eye with
my hair are you kidding me
alright so but starts that last but not
least oh my eyes last but not least are
these shoes that I got from H&amp;amp;M I got
some mini high boots and I have
knee-high black boots already but I like
these because they have a tiny heel so I
can wear these more like during the day
the other black booties or black boots
that I have that are knee-highs are like
a mega heel so I'm really happy I could
wear these during the day and they were
on sale for 30 bucks at hmm so I think
these are super super cute and they feel
really great quality which I like
because this part doesn't like fall down
with my other ones they do so I really
