and today I am in my kitchen if you guys
can't tell so this video is super random
I was not planning on filming this today
but I've been grocery shopping today and
I had a another one of those sentimental
moments that you have and graduate
college just like oh this is the last
time I'll do this this is the last time
I'll do this and I realize it was the
last time I will go grocery shopping in
college so I really wanted to film a
college grocery shopping haul before I
finish if you guys are new to my channel
please be sure to subscribe those videos
every Tuesdays and Fridays and yeah you
guys should just subscribe if you like
this video give a thumbs up it helps me
a ton on my channel before we start I
just wanna let you guys know this is a
vegan grocery haul I am NOT vegan but
when I do got buy groceries and when I
cook at home I try to cook as vegan as
possible or plant-based as possible I
should say that's why there's like a lot
of fruits and vegetables and just I
don't buy meat because I really really
am NOT have a huge fan of me in general
but anyways everything from here it's
from Trader Joe's and I go grocery
shopping with my roommate so he split
the bill and Trader Joe's is the way to
go it's so cheap you guys all of this
that I'm showing you was I think it was
$86 attacks so we only spent 43 dollars
each so that was really good because we
literally have no food in the fridge
right now so we basically just like
started from scratch I'm just showing
you and random back I don't know what's
in it there's no like categories in this
video it's just digging in the bag
okay okay so the first thing is that I
got is arugula I have just really like
arugula for salad it's definitely the
better leaf lettuce the better lettuce
it's not what it is the better lettuce
is fine and I've never done a grocery
yellow so it's funny seeing me describe
food I just really like arugula for
salads and the next thing that I got is
some whole-wheat bread so I make avocado
toast Allah I eat toast with vegan
butter a lot just as like a go-to snack
or breakfast so having some whole wheat
bread on hand is definitely essential I
like don't know what to do when we don't
have bread and I always store it in the
freezer because our bread goes so bad
whenever we kept it in our pantry so we
started storing it in the freezer but
seriously our bread never goes bad
anymore it doesn't get blue and moldy
comment down below if your bread ever
gets really a disgusting meal I can take
it out cuz it's so nasty yeah that's
definitely happened whenever we clean
out our fridge we're always like oh my
god and the next thing is some
strawberries obviously need our fruit we
just got this big thing of strawberries
from Trader Joe's we go through fruit
very quickly like fruit it's always the
first thing to go which I guess is good
because it does go bad quickly but it is
always the first thing to go like I will
eat fruit so like with acai bowls I'll
put a bunch of fruit in a or toppings
wise I'll just eat fruit is a snack
that's a dessert then we got bananas we
only got three bananas because Ali is
not the biggest oh I just dropped them
Ali it's not the biggest banana fan so
she's not just gonna like snack on them
but we have these for like smoothies and
toppings or in like the acai bowl or
anything like that and then we got this
brown rice organic brown rice and quinoa
spaghetti pasta this is also gluten free
neither of us are gluten free and we
don't ever like try to eat gluten free
but I just like having this instead of
like normal pasta so just because it
does have greens and so yeah we got the
spaghetti it tastes
just the same it's really really cheap
at Trader drivers it was like two or
three dollars process the easiest thing
to make in college I remember sophomore
and junior year I think I need pasta
like every single day because it's just
so easy to make you just boil water put
some sauce on it and call it a day so if
I'm ever feeling lazy and don't feel
like cooking I just like my go-to is
pasta and then the next bag I got some
raspberries so we have like the two
containers in one this is good
especially if you're sharing but again
like I said I go through through a lots
like it's like so bad how quickly I go
through fruit and I also want to know
what your favorite fruit is I think mine
is I love bananas and some people hate
bananas I just don't understand but I
love bananas and I love Kiwi and I love
mango and then I love like berries which
I think I just listed all of the fruits
but I'm just such a big like fruit fan
and then again I got some blueberries
this is the best for toppings for acai
bowls I think it's so good and
blueberries are my favorite fruits to
snack on because they're the easiest
because you don't have to wash or you do
have to wash that just you can watch
your blueberries you don't have to cut
them like strawberries but and then we
got cuties to snack on these are also
the perfect snack or if you're just
feeling hungry but like you don't know
what you're craving so you just want to
eat and then you normally crave junk
food when you're doing that you know
this is what I go for some Kiwis and
then next we have some tri-colored
organic sprouted tricolor quinoa which
lets get some quinoa this is such a
staple to have again if you're just like
wanting to cook up a quick dinner and
don't know what to cook and don't want
to be super unhealthy and like popping a
frozen pizza or something cooking quinoa
is so easy it's so quick you can just do
this throw in some vegetables with
slightly can make it a little stir fry
and you have a really really really good
meal and the next thing is Rikki
sought election zucchini again we do a
lot of stir fries and we'll just
incorporate vegetables until literally
everything so if he needs the way to go
at stir fry oh my gosh Oh God especially
if you have to like teriyaki or like
some soy sauce in it I think I want to
do like a cooking video maybe I'll do
that this summer because they just like
don't think I have time good semester
anymore but this summer I will do a
cooking video and show you guys like a
full day of healthy cooking meals let me
know if you guys want to see that
because I do really like cooking now
college does make me really like cooking
the next thing we ran out of is brown
rice so like I said we literally are
starting from scratch we had nothing in
our pantries anymore so this is another
essential we used to get white rice and
then when that ran out we just decide to
get brown rice brown rice is a little
healthier just because it's less
processed if you're trying to lose
weight the difference between brown rice
and white rice is not in the calories
it's just like how its processed so I
try to not eat processed food if I don't
have to do so that's why we got some
reverence and then we just got a can of
corn because we just like throwing corn
and random things as long as you guys
have a ton of vegetables on hand but
like seriously it is so easy to eat
healthy when you have healthy
ingredients on hand like you just throw
these in cooking healthy it does not
have to be hard and it doesn't have to
take long at all most of our meals that
we cook literally take 10 minutes to
make and that's it like they're so easy
to make and just you just need to have
like the right things on hand like if
you don't have any like grains or
vegetables or anything like that like
then yeah you're probably gonna cook
kraft mac and cheese but like if you
stock up on these items you will be able
to make a choice and in the next time we
got some onions again onions give
everything the same amazing flavor so I
always cook with onions some potatoes
Ali and I really really like making
Buddha bowls which are normally put some
quinoa and then we'll put some like
spinach in it some sweet potato or
potatoes and then we'll put a bunch of
vegetables and just
sit all in a big bowl and put like a
dressing on it and I just love cooking
potato it's this so good oh my gosh she
also got a little bag of lemons I
normally like making lemon water in the
morning so when I wake up if I remember
and if I'm feeling really healthy I'll
warm up a glass of water and put some
lemon in it or if you're ever feeling
sick I mix up like lemon juice a ginger
and cayenne pepper and take a little
shot of that and normally I feel a lot
better it wasn't like the hour so lemons
are just really really good to have on
hand I don't really cook with them
normally more for like beverages and
then this would not be a vegan grocery
haul if I didn't include avocados so we
got some avocados from Trader Joe's we
always get the mini ones because it's a
better proportion so people think that
all condos are healthy so you can eat
unlimited of them but avocados yes they
are healthy and yes they have healthy
fats fat is still fat and if you eat too
much of it you will like that's too much
of your fat intake that you should be
eating you shouldn't be eating like 25%
of your daily fat and like one a meal so
we get the little baby ones and I
normally just put half of this on a
piece of toast and then I'll store the
other half in the fridge or if I'm
feeling really hungry and just really
wanting some avocado then I'll eat the
whole one and I don't know
guilty because it is half but a good
portion for avocados is normally 1/8 to
1/4 so it's like a really really tiny oh
my gosh okay this is what I workout for
its show you guys this watermelon so we
got a watermelon it's summertime the
weather is warm and yeah we were just
thought of this the first thing that we
came in and we're like oh my god
watermelon sounds so good we haven't had
it in so long so I am excited to be
cutting this watermelon open it and
enjoying it when it's nice and warm out
next week it's gonna be like in the 80s
it's gonna be it's gonna be beautiful
green beans again how many times
having these vegetables on hand just
makes cooking so much easier we got some
coconut milk I like doing coconut milk
in my house ie bowls
sometimes I'll do it my oatmeal or in my
coffee sometimes but my new thing is oat
milk but I always buy it online because
no grocery store here sells oat milk so
I buy my online I make my up milk lattes
let's say if you guys have not tried it
try it it will change your life and rock
your world that is so amazing oh my gosh
it's literally my favorite like
dairy-free alternative in the world but
for other things other than coffee I
always have coconut milk it's so good
and we get the vanilla one which I know
adds a little bit of sugar but we really
don't care it tastes so good
and if you guys are a vegan Trader Joe's
holic you guys need to try this it will
also change your life it is the vegan KL
cashew and basil pesto so pesto is
normally not be in it actually has
either like cheese or dairy like just a
little bit in it which I was very
surprised but this is a vegan one from
Trader Joe's and it is the best pesto I
have ever tried it's better than normal
pesto like it is so good and it's just
he's so much more fresh so it doesn't go
bad quicker than if you buy like a pesto
in a can but I just think it's worth it
like it's oh my gosh I got some hummus
so we got some cilantro and jalapeno
hummus we've never tried it before
honestly neither of us are the biggest
fan of Trader Joe's hummus I think
Publix has the best one there's one
that's like cilantro mango and it's to
die for it's amazing
Leslie anything with the word sriracha
and I'll probably buy but another Trader
Joe's hummus but we're gonna try this on
and see if it's a winner because we have
tried so many Trader Joe's hummuses and
they just always disappoint
so hopefully this one's good we also got
cauliflower and yoky I don't actually
know if this is vegan let me see it
I wasn't sure if they have like Eggert
anything in it so basically this is your
pasta but it substituted with
cauliflower and I am so excited to try
this you guys know he is like my
favorite favorite pasta dish ever so I
will be making this with the pesto sauce
and having a very nice meal and then if
you guys like smoothies or acai bowls
like we do get some frozen fruit so I
got some fancy berry medley and then we
just got two of them because again we go
through fruit like no other looking so
much fruit and I still have the offset
you packets in the freezer so that's why
I didn't buy them this time but I do
recommend buying the ones for Trader
Joe's they're so good and they're just
frozen acai packet so you can put in
your Bowl and we got this trader dress
edamame it's fully cooked soybeans in
the pod these are so good and you don't
have to pay $5 for like a little bowl of
them at an Asian restaurant so I just
love snacking on edamame such a good
snack and it's such a good little
appetizer like while you're cooking
dinner snacking on this and wonderful
Trader Joe's literally tastes like I
went to a trade like an Asian restaurant
I just like put a bunch of salt on it
and it's good to go
and then last but not least we got the
Trader Joe's almond butter tumeric salad
dressing this is so good you guys we
have tried all three of them there's
three at our grocery store I don't know
if they have three everywhere if there's
one that's like a Green Goddess one
there's a ginger one and then there's
this one this one has been our favorite
it's so good it does taste a little
Asian II because of the tumeric but like
the almond butter makes it so smooth and
creamy and it's just oh it is so good
you guys and it's like super super whole
ingredients and no like hidden
ingredients in it which is super
important for us and that was it for the
grocery haul I really think it's enjoyed
this video let me know if you guys want
me to do a like cooking video or
anything like that but I'm glad I feel
this better late than never be sure to
