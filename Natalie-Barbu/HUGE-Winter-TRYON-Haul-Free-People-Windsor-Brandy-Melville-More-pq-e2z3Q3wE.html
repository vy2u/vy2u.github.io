humongous winter hole so i think i'm
just going to get just jump right into
it this is cumulative so i could not buy
this all at once i got this thing
starting in october ending about like
two days ago yesterday so i just decided
to do a huge winter call for you guys
and yeah just let me know what you guys
think in the comments below and don't
forget to enter in my giveaway that i'm
having just click right here in the
video will pop up so yeah anyways let's
just get started to do this hall the
first store that i want to show is free
people so my very favorite thing that i
got from people which i actually got
this a while ago but I just had to
include it in this hall because it's so
cute it is this leather and jacket so it
just has a bunch of details on it it has
also a cloth hood and it has a zipper
and just a bunch of my phone and
actually it's just very detailed super
soft leather and I have won it so so
much you guys are probably seeing where
is wearing this video's follow me on
instagram you guys probably have seen in
multiple pictures of me wearing this I
wear this all the time and it actually
does really keep you warm so whenever
it's cold outside you throw this on and
you instantly have a really really cute
Elfen it looks like you tried really
hard next thing from beauty three people
are these for tank tops they're all the
same they were twelve dollars but
there's really really good recentiy tops
here they are they have a really really
high neckline I actually wore my gray
one of these in
I vloggy click right here in he'll pop
up but yeah so I really like these there
I got black white grey which I wore in
my blog if you guys want to see that and
this really pretty blue color I bought
four of them just because they're all
great basic tanks and they were really
TV especially for three people the next
thing I got it for you people was this
not exactly wintery at all but it was
pretty cheap and I don't know who show
it this is what I got it's really cute
it's very thin and like fragile-looking
so you definitely to wear something
underneath is really really low sides
and the back is like a halter but it's
really cute and I love this blue color
and it has a lace of detailing at the
bottom the next thing I got is also from
free people and is this sweater I
actually got this on sale at Nordstrom
Rack as well as the other thing i just
showed it's just a bright orange fuzzy
sweater and I love wearing sweaters and
Brie people is my favorite brand so this
is perfect and it was on sale at
Nordstrom Rack so the next time i'm
about to show you is Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch
um I love shopping there I know many of
you guys probably don't because I feel
like not a lot of older people like
shopping there because they still think
it's kind of what it was when we were in
middle school trust me it's changed so
much and it's really really cute first
thing I got is this plaid skirt I really
love plaid skirts and I think this was
super Christmassy I like the leather
detailing at the top so it's not too
super conservative but it is really
really pretty and it's very flattering
and it just fits really nicely and it's
not like short or it's not sure or
anything like that it's just really cute
say I gotta Abercrombie many of you guys
are probably gonna be wondering what
exactly it is
this big thing it's very very big it's
actually scarf but I can throw it on my
bed and make it a blanket it's a huge
but I just thought it was such a warm
and cozy scarf and it reminded me of
Chuck Bass and gossip girl so I have to
get it the next thing I guys just a
basic shirt it's just long sleeve and
black and white stripes and I just
thought this is perfect just for the
days when I'm not feeling too dressed up
and you can totally dress this up or
dress it down it's super soft and I just
really like basic and seat or basic
shirts like that as you guys will be
able to see in the next outfits of this
whole next thing I got is this super
furry jacket it has a zipper and it's
worry all on the inside and I believe
the sleeves yeah even on the sleeves
it's very like this keeps you so warm
I'm so excited to add this at school
it's basically the just like you're
wearing a big huge hole like it the next
door that i'm going to be showing you
guys isn't winter if you guys want oh
they don't really have a lot of sores
like actually in the US at least I don't
think they do because I've never
traveled to a place where they have it
but winter store com I think you guys go
ahead and it has a ton of stuff in it
really cute clothes I'm just don't show
you guys what I got from there and this
stuff is actually said to me but I
actually got to pick out what I wanted
and I love all simply off first thing it
is this dress is a backless dress fits
like royal blue and my favorite part
about it is the back of it it's backless
but then it also has like the 70s
spired sleeves and I don't know I just
really really like it and I think I
might wear this for a few years just
because I don't really want to wear
anything too sparkly this year because I
feel like I always wear it and I just
like the color as the backless part of
this dress next thing I got is also kind
of something basic it's just a I'm gonna
army green with navy blue stripes and
it's just a super long tunic or well
sure or you can wear as a dress I
normally wear these with leggings and
kind of any sort of boots and then just
maybe a jacket on top so yeah I just
really like basic pieces and this dress
reminds me of basically all the brandy
melville dresses i have it's really
funny i'll show you guys how many i
bought but I call you like 10 brandy
melville doesn't look like this next
thing I got is also this another dress
but it's a super tight like sweater ish
dress it has a small turtleneck not too
much because I don't really like the
high turtlenecks and then it's super
super tight and it's kind of like that
I'm you know how to describe it this
like it feels like corduroy but it's
obviously not where I um and it's just a
dress with a long sleeves and i think
i'm going to wear it to a dinner
actually pretty soon so you guys might
see a picture me in this but yeah i just
like this because i like piling on
jewelry and kind of like dressing a
trick like dressing it up a ton since
it's so simple the next thing I got my
favorite thing it is this really a
pretty like grayish blue tunic
and you can dress this up and dress the
sounds so much action picture on my
Instagram of how I decided to be able to
make it casual to dressy so if you guys
want to check that out you can follow me
but yeah i just love anything that can
wear with leggings or tights and so i
could wear this leggings and tights so
that's why i really like it another
basic piece that I got is this just
plain white shirt that reminds me of
brandy melville and it has navy blue at
the top and at the bottom of the sleeves
and this looks like something I've seen
at brandy melville so many times except
we don't have brandy melville where I
live so this is perfect to just get it
online and I've heard so many horror
stories of brady mel bills online
shopping experience so I'm kind of
hesitant to shopping them online but
anyways this pretty much is an exact
replica next thing I got is this kind of
like sportage press I feel like this
reminds me of like a varsity jacket or
something just any luck score new dress
and it's a pretty tight dress but then
it's inches over here at the bottom of
it and I thought that was really cute
and it's pretty tight and you can
basically where this but how I wore it I
actually put a white short sleeve shirt
underneath its kind of give it a more
sporty your look and then I tour with
bands and I pretty much just dress it
down I'm sure you can dress it up but I
just like this for a very casual place
next door I guys american eagle and
surprise surprise another basic piece I
got a maroon actually everything I got
from american eagle is this color but i
got a maroon shirt with stripes white
stripes and of the blue at the collar
which i thought was really cute and it's
kind of short you know how all of them
are about this size it reminds me brandy
melville also and i just really love
these basic pieces my next thing that I
got you have might have also seen if you
watch my blog I was wearing them through
these really acute like parachuting
jumpy pants there's super baggy at like
they're tight on the waist and they're
super baggy until it reach
to your ankle and i know i will never
wear anything like this but these really
caught my eye and I actually love the
way they fit so yeah check it out
however in my blog I she wore it with
one of those freaks removing toxic next
thing I got is also the same color as my
shirt and basically the same color pants
it's just a sip of hoodie from american
eagle it was so so soft so i just said
to get it whenever I'm feeling kind of
like bumming it or just wearing it to
class underneath a jacket or something
like that I thought this was super cute
now the next thing I got is this these
pair of leggings I would wear them
that's like athletic leggings folks
they're like that super like athletic
silky material but I thought they were
really cute and yeah I just like them so
that's why I got them the next door is
brandy melville I actually went to New
York with my friends and so I we stopped
at the brandy melville and soho two days
before Taylor Swift right there so that
was pretty but like we were pretty
bummed out about that but anyways i got
this a ghost emoji plain t-shirt I
thought it is so so cute and I love
little ghost emoji on it and that's
basically why i got it next thing I got
is one of these dresses kind of like the
one from winter it's just a plain tunic
like just a long shirt / dress I have
this from Freddy Melville in black grey
white and black stripes this color and
really should I have one more color of
it in it but I wear these all the time
like these are my go-to for anything I
literally live in these so that is why i
bought look as many as I could again
Lego saying i bought the black one so
here's the black one of it they're only
$22 so they're not very expensive and
you literally can wear them with
anything next two words urban outfitters
and i only got one thing from there i
just got kind of these yoga pant like um
pants they're really big at the bottom
like yoga pants but they're tight
everywhere else is there are not yoga
pants there
material as my red winter dress like not
corduroy but they have like this like I
don't even know how to explain it but I
just these are on sale for ten dollars
and I thought they would be really
useful whenever I'm just feeling really
comfortable and the next door is forever
21 and I got a lot of stuff in there and
mainly leggings so I'm just gonna jump
right into that first pair of leggings I
got are my favorite they're these black
plain leggings with in at the bottom
they have these um see-through like mesh
material at the very bottom of it inch
destroyed so you can lick see your skin
and Stripes at the bottom it's not
really that clear on camera but you guys
know I'm talking about and they are so
so cute next income from 21 is actually
this big jacket I just got this because
I thought I could keep him warm it was
pretty cheap for a jacket and I really
like the multi I'm like fabrics like
here's like Anna not a kind like a
quilted fabric and here is another
fabric I am so bad it's kind of close
next thing I got is this really cute
accessory it's just a headband that you
kind of put it over here and you cover
your ears and forehead to keep you want
and as a little reindeer on it next
thing where they got was a beanie so
this is basically for the same purpose
of just keeping you warm next I get just
got these plain black leggings but with
and leather detail on the side and gold
and zipper so these are a lot more
dressy I feel like I can wear this to
like a business meeting or something
like that next I just got plain black
leggings plain simple there were two
dollars next hair is working that I got
are these maroon Christmas leggings I've
always wanted some of these they're
super super thick they keep you really
warm and they are so cute a flattering
next pair of leggings that I got RB
marine one they have black detailing at
the top and zippers and then they're
just plain leggings from there they're
really soft in there really it's really
a great piece just to dress up an outfit
to stay up the zipper on it yes thing I
got from peritoneum on is this dress
sweater dress it's pink with that
fuzzies all over and then it has pockets
at the bottom and it's really cute to
wear dress with some lace tights that's
how I wore it it's really really girly
and feminine next thing I got from front
anyone is this sweatshirt and just super
casual has I put on it and I just like
how it's black and white next thing I
got is from a Zulueta and is I've never
been into the shore but i really like it
they make workout clothes but just like
that you can wear for every day they
have really cute outfits the first thing
i got was this hoodie it's just a plain
like beige color but has so many details
on it i was very surprised next I got
these gloves they don't have the fingers
on them which I like because then I can
text and then they just add a little
thumb but they have fur on the inside so
they're super super soft in the air
group a and then last but not least from
athleta i got these leggings they are
very dressy for leggings their army
green they have super right here and
then they have this cool material right
here and so you didn't wear these
basically just like all like something
like a business meeting again you can
dress these up so much that's why I
really like all these leggings they can
dress up they're so comfortable yet
they're so cute anyways that is all my
hall I hope this wasn't way too much
