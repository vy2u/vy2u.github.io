my very first Halloween tutorial a
little late I know but better late than
never so I obviously am doing Harlequin
if you couldn't tell already by the
title the first second of the video and
the thumbnail that if you guys are new
here be sure to subscribe I'm actually
posting another Halloween tutorial
Friday for what I'm gonna be it's go
super easy last-minute one so be sure to
check that out if you guys go on the
costume already Hannah I've had so much
fun filming this you guys like it was
just great um yeah this was like such a
fun look to film so I've never done
anything like this before
totally out of my comfort zone I
normally don't wear wigs and this one
was like a super cheap one that I got
but yeah so tell me how you guys like
the look because it's so so different
and like I feel really cool like this I
just really wanted to transform myself
into her and kind of see what I would
look like and I'm honestly really loving
it so let's just get started with the
video so I'm not going to show you guys
how I did my foundation cuz I just did
that normally but I am taking this
colorful palette by Wet n Wild and
spraying my big eyeshadow brush and then
applying the red color to my lid I got a
little bit of black mixed in there by
accident but it actually worked so it
was fine I'm applying this super super
messy just all over my eye and then with
my finger I'm actually dragging it down
this look is so easy because you can be
as messy as you want so I'm just
dragging it down kind of looks like I'm
crying a little bit and then I'm going
back in and applying more of the red to
my eyelid I really wanted to make it be
as bright as possible then I'm spraying
it again on my eyeshadow brush flipping
it to the other side and applying the
blue this had a little bit of the red in
it so which I didn't really like but it
actually turned out fine in the end and
then again I'm doing the same thing I'm
just dragging it down with my fingers
this is just to give her like messy
crying type look and I'm actually using
both of the blues so I kind of just mix
and match I didn't have any rhyme or
reason to it and I used a blending brush
just to kind of make it a little bit
more pigmented I was trying to see what
could make it the most pigmented
but then I went in with my butt blending
brush and I actually applied a black
color and put that in the crease this is
just gonna darken overall look and make
it look more like Harley Quinn hers
wasn't just red and blue it was actually
like a little bit darker so that's why i
adding black to it is great and then i
went in with a black eyeliner and i put
that really really messy again on my
upper lash line and then i'm rubbing it
out with my fingers this is again just
to give it a more dark look and then i'm
applying it on my lower lash line and
doing the same thing just rubbing it out
at the end and that completes the eye
look besides mascara and then for the
eyebrows margot robbie / harley quinn
she does have dark eyebrows but i have
very dark eyebrows so i just went in
with actually a light brown color and i
tried making him not as bright or not as
dark but still be dark and bold if that
makes sense
so that's why i went with a lighter
color it honestly didn't do much but as
long as you brush it out i think it's
fine then i went in with my red lipstick
this is also from Wet n Wild I put it on
all over my lips again not really paying
attention to it just kind of messy I
didn't line them before anything then
I'm rubbing it with my fingers and as
I'm rubbing it in I'm also putting it
kind of all over my mouth then I'm going
in with a black eye shadow and putting
that on my lips again to give it a
darker look because hers wasn't that
that bright then I'm going in with a red
lip liner and kind of making the edges a
little bit more smooth because you still
don't want to look at that messy look
you want to look messy but not that much
then I'm going in with my black eyeliner
and I'm just putting a heart where the
red side of my eye is and then I forgot
mascara so I'm putting on mascara and
that's literally the whole look so
really easy but then actually I'm
putting in some black and brown color on
my forehead to make me look a little
dirtier like she did and now time for
the wig so I got this wig at a Halloween
store it was really cheap it is pretty
cheap quality but it worked out and I
hope you guys like the look
unfortunately I could not do any cool
video shots of me in this outfit so I
had to do this in my room so I hope that
you guys are okay with that but I just
got this shirt from Windsor store calm
and I made holes in it and then I cut
the color off the shorts are also from
Windsor store calm and then my fishnet
tights are from Hot Topic
and I actually did not have it as a belt
or the choker but I have the wig and the
rest of the outfit so I thought it was
good enough so I hope that you guys
enjoyed this makeup tutorial slash
Halloween tutorial I challenge you guys
to go out this in public and like walk
around the supermarket wearing this like
I don't know that'd be kind of cool
right
hope you guys enjoyed be sure to
subscribe if you haven't follow me on
all my social medias like snapchat
