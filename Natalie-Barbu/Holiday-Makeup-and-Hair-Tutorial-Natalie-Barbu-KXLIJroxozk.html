is so delightful since with no place to
go let it snow let it snow let's go
everyone it's not only here and today I
am coming to you guys with a holiday
look so I actually show you guys how to
get voluminous and smooth hair like you
see here this was super easy and I
didn't even use a brush which is
freaking awesome because I hate brushing
my hair I don't know why do I did this
without brushing it and you still get a
smooth and shiny look I mean like look
at how shiny my hair is but anyways
before I start this video I want to say
thank you to instyler for partnering
with me on this video I love your
products and if you guys haven't watched
my vlog when i unboxed their stuff that
they gave me like go watch it they're
the sweetest um but anyways I am showing
you guys they are below dryer it is this
one this is the box that it comes in it
is deep blue the lightest and most
powerful dryer and it is the turbo
iconic dryer so actually this is the
full-size one so it comes in a big box
but at Ulta for the holidays they're
actually doing such an amazing deal and
you actually get this mini one whenever
you purchase the big one so this is
perfect for traveling I'm traveling a
lot when a break actually going to Miami
twice and then I'm going in the
mountains I believe was perfect for
travel and you get it whenever you buy
the big one and also if you don't kind
of want to like be that creative on skip
so you can buy the blow dryer for
yourself and then give this one away
because I feel like many things are
perfect for gifts like you don't want to
buy like a big blow dryer for someone so
it's just kind of like Oh like that's
kind of random but when it's in mini
form it's like oh so cute like does
anyone feel that anyways if you guys go
to ulta today go find your nearest one
and get this with the purchase of the
big one and it's so freaking cute I'm
obsessed this one says tiny but mighty
so it's basically these exact same as
the big one except smaller have never
felt my hair be softer and all the
settings that it comes with it's amazing
so it has like you can either do like
turbo ions or low ions and like turbos
if you have like thick and like coarse
hair and then low is if you have fun or
not everyone's hair is equals so I don't
see why everyone just uses
settings on their blow dryer so I really
like how that this one has custom
settings yeah thank you guys so much for
sending it to me and be sure to check
them out i also used their smoother so
that is how i didn't use a brush because
it kind of has a brush built into it but
it really does a great job it's moving
your hair and making it look soft and
shiny instead of just pin straight and
fried so yeah thank you guys so much and
yeah be sure to subscribe if this is
your first time to see in my face hey i
love for you to subscribe and also
please comment down below and hopefully
guys enjoy this video and let's get
started so the first thing i do is start
off with a moisturised face this is my
face right out of the shower and I use
this perfecting base primer and I put
that mainly on the spots where I get
oily or where I have acne and then I go
in with my infallible Pro glow
foundation which I've been really liking
I've only used it a couple times but I
just put that all over my face and then
I actually blend it out with one of
these spoon brushes this is not the real
original spoon brush I actually got this
one from Mac but I really love the
finish that it gives and it just makes
you look a lot more airbrush then I go
in with my Maybelline age rewind
concealer I'm obsessed with this one
it's so so light but yet it covers I
don't have very dark dark circles but it
still doesn't look cakey or anything and
at first I warm up my concealer with my
finger and then I go in with my Beauty
Blender to make sure that is all blended
out but I like warming it up first then
I go in with my Kat Von D concealer this
is the absolute best concealer for
covering up any acne scars or blemishes
and I put that on all the blemishes I
see on my face my skin has actually gone
a lot clearer believe it or not and I
appreciate all of the love I've been
getting in the comments saying that like
you guys have asked me to and the
remedies that work for you guys so I
just blend it out with my Beauty Blender
and then I go in with my laura mercier
translucent powder this is the only
powder i use and i actually set this
underneath my eyes just because under
your eyes you have the thinnest skin and
you might get fine lines then I brush it
off right away so i don't really bake it
but i do put it on with a beauty blender
then i go in with my age rewind
highlighter actually this looks like the
concealer
but it is a highlighter and I love the
way it looks I put this on we're on the
apples of my cheeks or top my cheekbones
and then i blend it out with the Beauty
Blender it makes it just have a really
pretty like natural pink glow and then I
go in with my l'oreal true match color
corrector concealer or maybe not color
corrector crayon corrector I believe
it's called and I put this where i
normally contour and then i blend it out
with my Beauty Blender and on the sides
of my nose I just do a little bit
because since it is so pigmented but
then i blend it out and i blend it
upwards so that it blends with the
highlighter so that it's not like a
harsh line and it just all kind of looks
uniformed then i go in with my anastacio
a highlight kit and I put the purple one
on my cheeks this just gives it more of
a bronze look which I really like and I
love the color purple then I go in for
the eyes and I prime my eyes first and
i'm using my naked smoky palette and i
am applying a gray matte color and
blending that into my crease so I Brett
blend that kind of all over my crease
and on kind of on my lid on kind of
bring it up just kind of a as a base and
then I take a matte brown color and i
only put that on the outer parts of my
crease this is going to give it more of
a cut crease look then i take a spray
and i spray my flat shader brush and i
put the gold color all over my lid again
i love this because it gives it more of
a cut crease look since you're putting
the eyeshadow base on top or not the
base with the shimmery eyeshadow on top
and then i go in and just apply a little
bit more of the brown but not much and
then i go in with a pencil liner i did
not want this to look like an actual
eyeliner i wanted it to look a little
bit more smudge and i apply it to my top
and bottom lashes and then i go in with
my eyeshadow the gold one and i put that
underneath the black eyeliner now time
for mascara i would recommend falsies if
you're going for more dramatic look but
i don't really know how to put those on
and today i'm going to study so i didn't
really want to wear falsies to the
library and i'm doing my eyebrows and i
use the anastasia brow wiz where brow
kit i'm not really sure what it's called
the brow powder that she has
and I just fill in my eyebrows to be
natural shape I've done this a ton of
time so that's why I'm speeding it up
just because I've literally done this in
every single video and yeah just fill it
in with your natural shape I already
have pretty dark and bold eyebrows so I
don't need to overextend then for the
lips which is the biggest part i think i
am going in with my mac spice lip liner
and i'm filling in my lips and it looks
like i have like the lip injections or
something whenever I wear lip liner it
just makes it look so much bigger right
away then I'm just going in and applying
the liquid lipstick from Kat Von D and
then i'm applying a gold color onto the
Cupid's bow and in the center and
spraying my makeup with a setting spray
just to set it all and that is the final
look as for my hair I'm blow drying it
with blues turbo ionic dryer I'm
obsessed with his hair dryer since I let
my makeup or since I did my makeup first
and let my hair dry a tiny bit in the
beginning it only took a total of five
minutes to blow dry my hair completely
then I go in with in stylers two-way
rotating iron and this actually
straightens better than a flat iron
because it smooths and straightens your
hair I not kidding my hair has never
been more soft and I love that it has a
brush attached to it and it rotates as
it straightens to make make sure that
it's smooth it doesn't just make it pin
straight and fry your hair it looks a
lot more natural it looks way more like
you went to the blow-dry bar rather than
you straight into your hair so I am
obsessed with this and I really love the
way it smooth my hair puff day guys
