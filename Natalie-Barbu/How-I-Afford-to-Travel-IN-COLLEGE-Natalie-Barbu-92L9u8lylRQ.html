today I am filming a scrapple type video
for you guys so if you haven't kept up
with me I have been traveling non-stop
this summer so I just got back from
Europe so I was first in Miami then we
flew in Miami to Barcelona and from
Barcelona we plant a few days there then
we went on a cruise all throughout the
Mediterranean which is amazing and then
we stayed another couple of days in
Barcelona today I fly home to Charlotte
and tomorrow I go to Costa Rica and then
a week after that I go to California so
yeah my life has been non-self out of a
suitcase and I love it but I'm also so
tired and that is why the lack of one
whole week of videos went by because I
just did not have enough time to even
pre film or upload and the Wi-Fi Europe
was horrible but follow my vlog channel
for all the vlogs I'm starting to upload
them now because I didn't really have
Wi-Fi in Europe but I'm back and I'm
better than ever now so I thought that
this video was appropriate because it is
going to be how I afford to travel so
much as a college student so many people
always ask me like Natalie even go to
school I always see your picture you're
always like out on the town whatever or
like traveling everywhere so this video
is to help you guys figure out how I
afford to travel because a lot of people
are like oh she just relies on her
parents money no every trip that I do
with like just me and with my friend
that is a 100 person that paid for by me
my parents don't help me at all what I
do trips like that circle and family
vacations and they do but just for all
my other trips of during the school year
and like Costa Rica and California and
all that type of stuff that is not my
parents money whatsoever so I just want
to throw that out there I am like a
queen of finding cheap flights so I just
wanted to share with you guys on my tips
and let pre-charge in the video for the
first tip I am going to share with you
two a kind of travel task to find super
cheap flights so the number one app that
I use is Google flights and Google Place
is kind of my Savior right now like for
finding cheap flights because you can do
multiple different airforce and you can
do different days and see on their map
right there without even clicking on the
day how much it would be if you flew
that day and let that
1001
so I definitely use that and one of my
favorite features of Google Maps or
Google flights Googleplex is that it
lets you choose different airports so
instead of just choosing oh I'm going to
fly on Raleigh I normally do all of the
surrounding airports even if it's like
an hour away or an hour and a half away
also choose it because if you're leaving
like $200 on a plane ticket
driving an hour and a half is not that
big of a deal for me I'd rather save
money on the flight rather than the cost
of gas is never as much as a flight
especially if you're traveling with
other people so that is why I like doing
that that's like my favorite feature of
that and also you can track your flight
on there so it will give you updates on
when the price goes down if you aren't
ready to buy it right now so I always
use Google flights the next thing is an
app on your phone and that is called
hopper so I use that because it tells me
when flights are cheap so it will you
can put in the days that you want and
then I'll be like you know what don't
buy it right now it's going to go down
most likely or buy it now because the
prices are going to go up so it's just a
good indicator for me to see if I should
buy this per ticket now or if I
shouldn't but I definitely always use
Google Maps first or Google flights and
keep saying Google Maps Google flights
first another thing had to comprehension
with that is always always always make
sure to use your incognito window if you
have Google Chrome
I'm sure Safari has this too but I use
Google Chrome if you google chrome you
can use an incognito window which means
that none of your cookies are enabled
and if you don't know what cookies are
it's basically everything kind of stores
your history on your computer so slice
and Google flights and airline companies
know that this person has been looking
up this flight for the past two days
they must really want to buy the ticket
so we're going to jack up the prices so
knees and hug me know they have no idea
what you have searched previously or who
you are or anything like that so that is
why I love using incognito because
tickets will be cheaper if they don't
know that you've been searching for them
inside your travel hacks that I have for
you guys is to use or to be flexible and
I know people think this a lot but what
I mean by being flexible is what I said
earlier
choosing the multi-city is like
beautiful with where you fly it out and
where you fly into because that can save
you a ton of money also be flexible with
the times
all have a stuff but also another app or
another website that I use sometimes
it's called jet LAG's and this one's
kind of like a scheming website like I'm
not like that comfortable and gouging
for it but it really doesn't work if
you're super you want to find cheap
tickets so-called jet LAG's and
basically what it is is that if you're
applying to let's say like Charlotte to
Dallas website you want to go from
Charlotte North Carolina to Dallas Texas
and you there's a flight on jet lag
that's like from Charlotte to I don't
know like California and it's cheaper
than the flight from Charlotte to Dallas
but it has a layover in Dallas so what
you would do is you invite a caliph or
the Charlotte's California flight and
just never catch your layover you know I
never take the slice California just
stop at your layover and Dallas and get
off the only thing is that is that you
can't check bags in but if that is not
an issue for you then I would totally
recommend it on my friend use it just
recently to go to st. Louis and it was
way cheaper like a hunch dollars cheaper
for her to do that so that is a half but
not a lot of people know if you just get
off at your layover and then you can see
what ton of money the next one is about
where you're going to stay so hotels is
another thing that you really need to
remember that that cause money to like
you're not just buying the plane to get
you're also we need to find a place to
stay so if you have friends in the area
you're going to great stay with them but
if you don't is that Airbnb is my
favorite way to travel
Iowa's don't even remember the last time
I stayed at a hotel when I traveled with
my friends so you can also use my code
4/3 dollars off of an Airbnb if you
never use their baby before and you use
my code you have $30 off your first day
which i think is a lot so yes definitely
use that with the link down below but
everything is my favorite because the
prices are so so so so much cheaper than
a hotel
I read someone's trying to go to New
York with my friends and I was going to
do an Expedia bundle which means that I
got the flight in the hotel and it was
cheaper but then I looked up the flight
with just an Airbnb and it was like $200
cheaper even without even like super
than the bundle so Airbnb is so much
cheaper for when you are traveling and I
have never had a bad experience at an
Airbnb you do need to keep in mind
they're not necessary if you want to get
really really cheap ones they're not
terribly luxurious and not going to be
the problem that cute but they will save
you so much money and if you're like me
you're
going to even be in the room you're
going to be out and about doing things
so I think it's mostly to travel also
when I live in a Paris I use this app
called hotels nice and that one is going
to help you find cheap tickets for that
day specifically so basically what I did
is I was like I need a hotel for tonight
so are you going to do it up to a week
in advance and all the hotels that have
rooms that they haven't booked yet but
they want to book them they discount
them so much so in Paris I would say it
pretty nice in hotels for like $80 a
night which is really cheaper than what
it normally would be so I definitely
recommend that too if you're more
comfortable staying in a hotel the next
thing I recommend is using frequent
flyer miles so this isn't one secret to
travel hacks but if you guys don't know
basically every airline uses frequent
flyer miles I have American Airlines I
have a credit card with them and I use
them for when I travel I try to stick
with American the most because that's
normally the cheapest place for where I
live so if you usually go hot flyer
miles you can basically get sliced for
free if you travel enough so it's one of
those that spend money to make money but
if you have a credit card with them
you're basically every time you just buy
anything not even slice you get miles
with the airline so I highly recommend
that when I'm going to Costa Rica
tomorrow and I bought my flight
completely with frequent flyer miles so
I didn't even spend a dollar on the
flight so definitely definitely look
into that especially if you are trying
to build up your credit and you're like
18 or something like that that I would
recommend doing it with an airline
instead of anything else and then the
next thing is put specific money away to
travel so part of my paychecks I always
put 50% on my paycheck to my savings
that's just an automatic like I'm not
going to touch it I'm just about 50% and
my savings the other 50% I'm free to do
whatever I want with it but I tried to
do 20% on my paycheck to just traveling
so that has worked out for me I
basically spent all my money on
traveling lately as leaves though so
that seems like lately but definitely
put aside money to save and then put
aside separate money to just
specifically to travel because then you
won't feel out the guilty spending like
$300 on a flight if you've already were
saving that money to travel anyways so
that is definitely a huge tip for me it
makes me feel way less guilty because
I'm like you know what are you for my
money of my savings this is my money
literally just travel so I'm just going
to use that for that and I'm not going
to feel bad about it but it definitely
do that because when you'll still have
other money to do other things but you
still have a portion of justifications
and it might take you a while to build
up enough money to go on a cool trip
that you want to go to but it definitely
will pay off in the end the best fix in
your money is making memories in my
opinion and also to see experiences and
seeing new places and seeing different
cultures I love traveling so much my
bucket list right now is Thailand is
number one I want to go to Thailand so
so badly I do want to go to more places
in Europe since I was just there I
really want to go to Japan I want to go
to Australia
I would love to at seven places in South
America I just really want to see new
cultures and see just places that I
haven't been to before that would be
amazing so that is it for my video if
you guys have any other travel tips
leave them down below and also tell me
your travel bucket list because I would
love to know them and yes tell me any
other ways that you guys save money
traveling because I would love to know
them because like you said I travel a
lot and other people will get to doesn't
