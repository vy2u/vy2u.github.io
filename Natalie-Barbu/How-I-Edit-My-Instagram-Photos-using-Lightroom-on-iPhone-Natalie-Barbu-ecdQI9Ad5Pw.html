channel it is Natalie here and today I
am filming a video that is very very
highly requested especially for those of
you guys that follow me on Instagram
which if you don't just gonna throw it
out there I did a video like this
earlier in the year but I have changed
my editing style completely so I really
want to show you guys and I have been
doing like on my Instagram story for
those of you guys who follow me like
before and afters and so many of you
guys have DM me saying that I should do
a video like this so that is why I am
doing that so if you guys are new here
please be sure to subscribe I post
videos every Tuesday and Friday and
sometimes I'll just throw random videos
here and there and I also have a vlog
channel so you guys really like college
vlogs I am a college blogger so go and
check out my vlog channel I'm sure you
guys will like it but I'm just gonna get
started so also these braids and like
the checkered shirt and the choker I
just feel like very grunge like kind of
like The Addams Family I don't know I
don't I don't know how I feel about it
so I just didn't really want to put heat
on my hair and this was like the easiest
thing to do and I also haven't tanned in
like maybe six months so it's the pale
face but this is the first photo I'm
gonna be showing you guys so this looks
like I took it out like 2 p.m. like the
way I edited it but if you hold it down
to see the before it definitely you can
tell it's at nighttime so you went out
at night so it was kind of hard to get a
good lighting but with editing seriously
anything is possible like you don't even
need to worry about the lighting that's
much especially with Lightroom and this
is all on my phone you can have to do so
much more on the computer but I'm just
gonna show you guys oh my god so I am
going to restart this photo first thing
that I do is I go down to the light and
all and knock up the exposure a little
bit for this one I knocked it off quite
a bit just because it was at night and
then I will actually turn down the
contrast depending on the picture
sometimes I put it up sometimes I put it
down but normally safe to bet that I put
it down a little bit
highlights I put it all the way down I
just like that because as you guys can
see if I turn the highlights all the way
up it makes the sky like you can't see
the cloud you can't really see the
details but if you turn it all the way
down you can see like the buildings
clear in the back like the clouds on the
sky the different colors of the sky I
just think it makes it look so much
better I guess like especially if you're
taking pictures outside for shadows I'll
bump them up just a tiny tiny bit whites
I'll knock them up and blacks I'll knock
them up just a little bit so once in
stuff like that is what it looks like
then I go to color and I always make my
pictures a little warmer so I'll put it
to about 10 I don't want me to look like
super orange but I'll bump it up to like
10 for the tint I always put it a little
bit more pink but that only adds just a
tiny tiny bit vibrance I put it up a lot
but then saturation I not normally take
it down because I don't like my pictures
to look like I'm like a fake orange or
anything like that but I like it to have
like vibrant colors that you can see if
that makes sense so see if I like to put
the vibrance all the way up it's kind of
like saturated but like if I'd only do
it like halfway it just makes the colors
look better so right in the top right
corner of the mix is the most important
part for editing your photos so here is
all of the colors so Lightroom has it
where you can pick out hues and tones in
the picture and individually adjust that
tone like so you leave the rest of the
picture how you have adjusted it but
with those specific tones it will adjust
the picture for you so over a red sea I
don't really have like my skin it kind
of picks up his red so here I can make
me look like I have leg Conner yeah and
then oh where I can make it look like
I'm like super sunburned but I don't
want to really touch that well I'll just
like bump up the saturation a tiny tiny
bit to make myself a little more tan for
the orange I think it's also gonna pick
up my skin yeah even more so again I
don't want just a hue because I don't
want he's good to be a different color
and then yellows I don't think there's
really much I guess like the background
it shows but I don't really care about
that so I'll leave it or sometimes I'll
like make it more like
illuminance illuminance cuz see if you
put it down it gets darker if you put it
up and makes things look more white so
with that I'll do that for the greens it
might pick up the trees in the
background yeah no it doesn't even one
of the trees in the background it picks
up but I normally don't even touch that
mango like make it work limit it and
then here the blue the blue I'll turn
down to me a little more green and then
I'll turn the saturation up and then
I'll turn the luminance like really
really up because that only guests that
look like blue on the right hand corner
but then this next blue which is a
darker blue is what's gonna get the sky
so this is how I adjust the sky the most
so for hue I always bring it down to the
left not all the way obviously but just
like a little more to give it that more
like aqua color versus bringing it all
the way up which gives it a purple sky
which could look cool if you wanted to
make it look like a sunset but that's
not the look I was going for so I turn
it down just a tiny bit and then I'll
turn the saturation like a tiny bit up
and then I'll turn the luminance up
though so I'll keep it just unless the
hue may be a little lower and then like
the Lumina you know like because if you
doing the luminance all the way up then
it goes white so I just like adjust it
to my liking so I think that looks
really good so like 40 luminance and
negative 40 cube and the luminance makes
it look like it's daytime and then
there's no purple or pink in the picture
so I just hate it done and then for
effects I'll put the clarity pretty high
like 14 so like pretty high but just a
little bit maybe a little more just cuz
that I feel like makes the picture look
a lot more crisp and then for detail
I'll sharpen it just a little more and
yeah that's how I got this picture so
it's completely different look it looks
like I took it at night which I did and
then here it looks like I took it in the
day so it's really really cool seeing
the before and after for these I think
that's like really really neat and now
I'm gonna show you just from scratch how
I would edit this picture I obviously
don't like the way I look in this
picture I think
I look like very weird but I'm just
gonna show you how I edit it okay so
this one obviously it's super super dark
like you probably if I were to take this
and hand it back to you you guys would
be like oh my gosh this is such an awful
picture but trust me with Lightroom you
can do all things for the light with
this I'm obviously gonna take the
exposure pretty high because it's such a
dark picture but you want to be careful
because if you overexposed like it's
just gonna look like grainy and like not
lose good photo you know so like I'm
gonna look halfway for contrast with
this I'm gonna turn it down just a tiny
bit highlights I'm gonna bring all the
way down as you guys can see if the
highlights are all the way up the sky is
just like a white sky which is if what
you're going for it that's fine but for
me I want the highlights to show so I
put it all the way down shadows I'll put
up just a tiny bit white so I'll put up
and blacks I will put up especially if
it's a dark photo I turn into blacks up
for color again I just warm it up and
then I'll turn it to more pink a little
bit vibrance I do quite a bit saturation
for this one actually gonna add because
it was so dark before that I feel like
there's like already not a lot of color
so I just want to add a little bit more
for the mix so for the Reds you guys can
see the building behind me is actually
changing colors and for my theme I want
a little more pinks so I'll make that
pink but I'll turn the luminance up just
to brighten it a little bit and I'll
saturate it just a tiny bit to make it
have more of a pop for the orange I'm
assuming it's gonna change maybe my skin
tone yeah it's gonna change my skin tone
okay so it's gonna change the skin tone
I the color behind me so I do not want
that to change at all so then the
saturation I'll bump it up though just
to make me look a little more tan you
know for yellow I think it will change
the sky behind me yep so I want a little
more orange colors and then to
saturation to be high and then luminance
to be a little high to to make it look a
little more realistic
I guess greens I don't think anything's
gonna change yeah so we're just gonna
leave that blues I think that will be
nothing again okay now this blue I think
but isn't really anything you guys can
see it's like the reflection and my son
glasses and stuff but I don't really
want to change that so I'm just gonna
leave that at zero
Purple's nothing Pink's not much okay
that looks good to me for clarity
bumping it up and for sharpening and
bumping it up and look at this before
like that's unreal this before to the
after that after actually makes it look
like a pretty good picture and all I did
is edit through Lightroom I think that
is so incredible that is it for how I
edit my Instagram photos that's
literally all I do I just take it
through in lightroom i don't use vsco I
don't really use facetune unless I like
and want to like whiten my teeth or like
detail like like a jacket or something
like that but that's really only he's
basting the board so that is it for that
this video be sure to follow me on
Instagram if you guys let me see all my
other pictures if you guys like this
video give it a thumbs up if you guys
think I should sell presets let me know
because I would love to do that I would
love to have like different presets for
different things way to get more but
yellow picture more of a blue picture
whatever you name it I would love to
have them and of course I would make
mine super affordable cuz like I'm not
any one big like I would make it look
fun over crews that or something like
that I don't know but let me know if you
guys want me to sell them and I will
talk to you later bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
