today I am filming a college Q&amp;amp;A video
so I asked you guys on Instagram any
questions that you guys had for me
because I was going to be filming it
this week and I got quite a few
questions have not seen my other two
videos I will have them linked down
below a two videos about school I think
maybe just one no I definitely up to
yeah yeah yeah I have to some of you who
don't know me and just stumbled across
this channel I am 28 years old that is
soon to change though I'm about to be 21
I am so excited next week is my birthday
so I'm pumped
um I also go to Miami for my birthday so
if you guys want to follow my vlog
channel I just started it I don't have
any videos up on it yet but if you guys
want to get the first look at that I
don't have that link down below to see I
can be sure to subscribe and I am also a
engineering student so that surprises a
lot of people just because my videos are
not engineering related really my video
simply focus on fashion and makeup and
just typical YouTube like lifestyle
youtuber which most youtubers are not
engineering majors but PS that is what I
am and if you guys want to ask what type
of engineering I am an industrial
engineer and yes that is real
engineering even though I got some
comments saying a little bit but that's
fine you do you you think what you think
and if you guys want to participate in
the next Q&amp;amp;A follow me on snapchat
Instagram and Twitter I have them
Instagram Q&amp;amp;A I've done a snapchat Q&amp;amp;A
and I have yet to do Twitter Q&amp;amp;A because
they don't really use with that often
but if you guys think I should use it
limit I just want sitting down and
talking to you guys so if you guys are
going to comment oh my gosh you talk so
much just click out my video the first
question is by Danielle okay Williams
and she says why are you serving
engineering if you plan on working in
marketing / communications so I've
talked about this in other videos
engineering is not my passion I guess I
would say I went into engineering
because I really I'm good at math I was
decent at science and I really just
liked solving problems and having more
of analytical skills I really wanted to
develop those and I knew I was already
good at that
so that is why right into engineering
um but I have pursued YouTube and gone
figure on YouTube I have an actual
passion for it I love it and I wish I
could be doing it full-time so that is
why because this kind of took often
because I do YouTube videos I have
realized my passion for marketing and
communications and anything to do with
kind of making my brand and working with
brands so that is why I decided to I
think after college I want to work more
in a feel to YouTube related rather than
engineering I do want to explore more of
the YouTube side after I graduate and
really dedicate time so that subscribe
this summer I decided not to look for
internships and to just focus on you
Daniel K Williams also asked how to get
out of a funk in college I feel like
everyone will experience a funk
sometimes and to get out of the ass
honestly it's everyone will go through
it and that's also something to remember
that you're not the only one I know
being in college it's kind of hard
because everyone's doing stuff and
everyone seems to kind of have their
life together but it's kind of all like
a parent's lies because every single
person gets into one of these like
sooner or later everyone I talk to has
been in a funk if you might say in
college and even if they seem like they
have it all figured out no one really
does and I think that's something to
remember that we are so so young I'm
only 20 about to turn 21 years old like
that is so young so just keep that in
mind when you're kind of feeling low and
feeling bad about yourself dear task
asked what my dream job and I have
already touched on it anything YouTube
related because that's what I truly
truly love then we have a live in New
York City I said that so many times I
was thinking about it more in Southern
California it's also super cool so I
don't know I'm kind of married to see
where the future came to Meijer that
Masetto I'm sorry if I pronounced your
name on it said what subjects you
currently study in what's your favorite
one I'm also an industrial engineering
student so if you have some tips that
would be great
so I already answer that and I don't
really want to go back into it because
in my engineering video I literally talk
about all the classes I take how what my
major is why I chose it so I will have
that link down below so that could be
like a 50 minute long video answering my
question
art by Jay asked how do you stay
motivated and how do you
a healthy lifestyle art by che asked how
do you stay motivated and how do you
keep a healthy lifestyle so this is
another question that I get asked a lot
and I think it's saying motivated is
hard because everyone again gets into a
funk but they motivated for me is just I
know I have to do it I have a lot of
pressure on myself too I'm not one of
those people that I can just fail a
class and be okay with it or I can just
not do my homework assignment be like
whatever like you know that there's some
people that are like oh I accidentally
missed my test ha ha to me if I miss a
test I would have died I would reach out
like I just can't do that
so I think that's also like a
personality thing for me I motivated
because I know I want to do the best
that I can so that's honestly just how
I've been always on when I was in high
school and middle school and even
elementary school my parents never
really asked like oh what grades are you
getting or would you bet on that test
but they never really asked that they
were never upset at my answer like if I
did well they would obviously say like
oh my gosh good job but if I did poorly
they weren't ever mad at me I never got
grounded for grades because I they knew
that if I just bad or if I just poorly
like I would put pressure on myself I
would be punishing myself more than they
could like honestly sometimes I'll call
my mom and I'll be so upset about a
grade or so upset about tests and she's
the one that's like listen it's okay
like you're fine you fail the test
that's fine the kind of hard question
because that's just for me like I always
tried to do like that so if you are one
of those people then you know what I'm
saying and if you're not just fake like
why are you wasting time like college is
expensive you don't want to take it for
granted because there are so many people
that can wish the signaler college and
they're not and they can't afford it or
they just weren't able to get in so also
realizing that we are given something
that most people in the world don't have
I think puts it all into perspective and
that can motivate you in itself
hopefully and how do I keep a healthy
lifestyle is the second part of that
question um I have ultimate video of
working how I hate answering questions
with okay have video on that but I
really do I'll have that one links down
below also it's actually my most viewed
video so thank you guys so much for that
but basically I just make sure I have it
in my schedule to work out I work out
about 45
a day and I do it in effort in the
morning so I have to do in the morning
because then I won't do it in that
kanoon so if you just put it into your
schedule kind of like hey I have class
from 1:30 to 3 I have to work out from
12:00 to 1:00 let's just put it in your
schedule and then I think that you will
make yourself do it and eventually in
the beginning you're going to hate it
and really no I don't want to but then
you are going to feel so good once
you're in shape and you're going to keep
wanting to work out so it's just like
it's gonna it's going to work this is
Firefly's underscore 2 said how do you
ensure that you are focus do you find
that you need to make social life
sacrifices in order to do well yet some
people see yet some people seem to
juggle it all so well yes of course
being an engineering major and also
having a YouTube channel that I focus on
i 100% make social sacrifices I think
I've gone out like out at night two
times this whole semester which some
people go out like three times a week so
yeah no I definitely I need me
personally I don't like going out that
much I'm more of a morning person but I
mean there are some times that I want to
and I'm like I can't like I have so much
homework so I definitely do make social
sacrifices I also like to travel a lot
that's something that if you guys follow
me on social media you know that I'm
traveling a lot so I will do all my
homework in my studying during the week
so that I have time on the weekends so
even if something's new on Monday I'm
going to do that on Thursday so that
Friday I can actually have a weekend and
have fun I don't have a boyfriend so I'm
visiting him a lot you go see UNC or he
will come here
and we do homework together and he's a
computer science major so he also has a
lot of homework so that's good because
like we both will be sharks Alan and
will be like okay at least you can study
together so yeah I definitely have to
make sacrifices for my social life but
my number one tip is to make sure you do
it during the week and like you have
spend all your time doing it during the
week so during the weekend can you have
free time
sien sprat how hard is it to meet people
make new friends and what are the best
places to meet new people so this is not
a major related question and that's
exciting
so for college meeting people is the
number one thing I feel like when people
think college they also think of social
life like that's just legal hand-in-hand
at least in the u.s. I know other
countries don't like that much emphasis
on your social life and college but
at in the u.s. they definitely do and
meeting people you can join the sorority
or a fraternity and that's a good way to
meet you all but if you're not the
sorority type I was in a sorority for
two years and then I dropped if you're
not the Greek life type there's so many
clubs that you can join every single
person is new even but you can go join
senior year you don't need to be a
freshman join any club they're so so
many honestly I know source weird but
whenever people go to the gym a lot they
meet people at the gym so that's also if
you want to be healthy and meet other
like me people maybe go to your gym set
of life saving the workouts at home also
on campus in your class always try to
sit next to someone new that's what I
always do in the beginning yeah if I
have friends I'm gonna sit next to them
but like if I don't know anyone don't
like relate yourself make sure to sit
next to someone and talk to them during
class and like ask her for their number
if you guys have homework help or
something like that I guess those are
just the ways that I've met people when
my best friends actually I met her
because we were in the same classes and
I saw her around and I literally went up
to her and was like hey like are you
into this class Michael because I am and
now we're only good friends so yeah just
go up to people meet them everyone is
looking to find friends so you're not
going to be weird
Rach d13 asked do you have any tips for
group work and how to be an effective
group member so my only tip is don't be
that person that doesn't do anything
because everyone will hate you and also
don't do everything for the group you
better make sure that people do stuff so
like remember in the sense everything I
will tell people be like this is your
part get it done by tomorrow
so yeah and I've definitely been that
person that doesn't do that much work
either I've kind of been on both sides
and I hate it when I don't do a lot of
work because I'm like oh my gosh they
hate me but you know some people just
kind of like take over and you're like
what do I have to do and they're like
nothing looks well give me some work I
don't sit here and do nothing but I've
definitely been both sides biggest tip
is to if you are the one doing all the
work take control and just assign people
things and if you're not doing work then
ask what you can do so that you don't
seem lazy and then so like you I hope
this helps if you have any other tips
for me know in the comments below if you
have any different questions I don't
answer them don't forget to follow me on
all my social media and on my blog
channel so you can be heard like but
first look I know there
videos up there yeah but there will be I
promise um and yeah yes that's it I'll
go I'm getting my mic fix I don't have a
mic right now but I'm going to get it
and I hope you guys enjoyed this video
