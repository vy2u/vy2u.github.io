today I am filming a kind of
school-related actually definitely
school related video it is how I take
notes and videos really highly requested
because alarms last me how I kick notice
how I study and how I stay organized so
this is kind of an all-in-one because I
stay organized like the way I take notes
like I organize that so I feel like it's
just like an all-in-one and I study with
the way I take notes I don't know you
guys will get to see but it is an actual
different video this is my iPad so I
have that iPad pro I absolutely love my
iPad so much I definitely recommend it
for anyone in college or maybe even high
school but yeah it's just awesome and I
can't say enough good things about it
bison is your first time seeing my face
hello I am Natalie nice seeing you
virtual handshake how I love it if you
guys would subscribe or just follow me
on my social media up with me if you
guys are already subscribed and want to
see more and also if I just came back
from Europe so I haven't kind of blogs
up on my channel and I think I'm going
to be starting a small channel soon so
if you guys would like that let me know
in the comments and your telescreen
notes you definitely watch those I'll
put those down below I got anything else
to say Xin chào because everything when
I say I'm going to show you guys an
actual video so without further ado
let's get started on how a penis okay
guys so you are going to ignore my
absolutely awful like embarrassing
cannot believe I'm filming this my mom's
going to kill me nail polish in this
video I'm going to get my nails on after
this video but I really needed to edit
this and put this up so yeah
bear with me here I know it's discussing
here is my iPad so it is a giant iPad
every single time I pull it out everyone
always makes a comment like oh my gosh
then iPad that's the biggest one I've
ever seen literally every time it is
twelve point nine inches diagonally and
it's about the size as my macbook
screen so basically the size of a screen
of a laptop twelve point nine inches and
I just have this cover that I got on
Amazon it is a little Verity I don't
know if you guys can see but I got
Amazon because they are so much cheaper
than the ones at the Apple store and
it's one of those when you open it and
like wakes up and then you close it and
falls asleep so I really really like it
and I like this color and I also have
the Apple pencil which I absolutely love
could not say greater things about it
and I will show you more on how I use
this and how crucial it is if you have
an iPad pro so you open it up and this
is my screen saver I just have a cool
picture that I got from Pinterest I just
really liked this photo so I have like
the fingerprint here's my homepage I
have another cool picture on it and yeah
that's it the main folder is my school
folder so in my school folder I have
DocuSign which I actually have not used
yet but it's a app that you can sign
documents and notability which is the
baby that we will be talking about a ton
today I've seen out which I have not
really used with like PowerPoint but for
Apple I have pages which is just like
Microsoft Word for Apple numbers which
is just like Excel the Apple Mouse
iBooks which I have my textbooks and
quiz WA and duolingo zoo lingo is kind
of an app to help you learn a new
language and I just have that and those
interesting and so notability yet so at
the top of notability I have all of my
subjects right here I just got this iPad
this semester so I'm only in four
classes so why don't we have my statics
class I have my is e-cloth so it's like
one of my major classes I have my
electrical engineering class and I have
my other ISE class which is for my major
so I separate them into folders I also
have a YouTube folder let's just go into
my statics one because that's the one
that I take most of notes in so you can
label on your notes and you have all
your notes right here which is so so
nice here's one of the notes and I have
the settings to have like graph paper in
the back but you can actually change it
so if you want to have no like lines in
the background you can do that if you
want to have just like frame lines in
the background you can like a normal
paper you can make it like rules or you
can make it
graph-like a grid which is what I do now
I think notice this is what my notes
look like and it is so so accurate you
guys it is just like writing on paper
except better because it's on the tablet
which i think is more fun and better
because you can use all sorts of
different tools so I use the panic tool
and I just make it in almost one of the
smallest one because there's like a
medium one and it's huge so I don't want
that to write my nose I use the Apple
pencil so the Apple pencil is basically
the best thing ever for this iPad if you
don't have it you definitely definitely
just get it or if you're thinking about
getting an iPad pro you definitely need
this pencil it's exactly where's my
handwriting it writes so smoothly it
doesn't lag it doesn't do it like it's
literally like writing with a pen on a
tablet if it is so so so good it's just
like writing on a piece of paper
accepted electronic and I back up all of
my notes onto Google Drive so all my
notes if my iPad crashes or if it breaks
they're all back stuff onto my Google
Drive which is nice and I can access it
anywhere so if I have notability on my
laptop or on my phone which I do I can
access it through there too so here are
my notes from today and I'll show you
like one of my homework assignments so
like for example one of my homework
assignments as you can see I did not
actually draw this image so for me how
how I insert an image into it is I
multitask and I swipe this way and this
is how you multitask and I actually have
the book in my iBook so I bought the
book and I have it on iBook and here you
can like swipe through your textbook
which is very nice and if you want to
work on both you can actually be like
writing on here and then also working on
your textbook and like looking at it
zooming into it whatever while you're
like writing and copying down notes so
that's really really cool about that and
then how I get the picture they look say
I want to get this picture to solve this
problem onto my notes so i zoom a super
close and then I screenshot and then I
don't Revere
put my photo is what it also does I grab
whatever I screenshot it and drag it to
my notes and then I edit this little
battery and then I crop it so that I
only get the image that I want and then
you can drag it anywhere on the screen
you can make it big if you want you can
make it big you can make it small it
doesn't matter you can drag it and you
can also write on it which is what I
really really like about this so if I
watch it right on it
let's not erase that if I want us to be
like oh there's there's a force like
right here and right here like I can
draw on it which is really really nice
if I want to circle something it can
change the color of what I want circle
or I can like highlight if I want to so
highlighting is really nice so let's say
I want to write like hello and I want to
highlight it it just look with a normal
highlighter like it's so easy to use so
it's like an actual notebook if it's
except I think it's like way better than
a notebook so I want to take away all
things you can have a thing so that is
how I got is that and this is actually
not from my text book but it is from my
online homework so I just drag the
picture of this and then again I multi
task and you can go through all your
apps here which is really nice so I go
to my messages and I have sent them all
to myself from my Apple Computer I sent
the messages like I dragged it there and
I send it to myself and then they come
on my iPad and you can just do the same
exact thing this is really really nice
about this because obvious is your
iPhone it's so small you can't will
hijack what was this you can so I want
to show you guys how we did is to write
on here so you just make a new sheet and
I have it automatically for grid but
again like I said you can do anything
and I'm going to write with a black
marker
that is literally exactly my handwriting
like I'm telling you that you guys can
see as I'm writing like it's just like
exactly the same thing like no lagging
whatsoever it's gorgeous
I will love it so so much and then the
eraser is nice because since all of that
was kind in one motion I can kind of
just like erased it all at once so it
kind of erases through each like motion
there's notability which is the app that
we are on recognizes that your palm is
pressed onto it like it would a sheet of
paper so my comments on it but yeah I
can still write 100% clearly because it
knows that my poem is on it so what
that's a really nice so you don't have
to write like like that you know like
you can write normally so that is one
thing I love about I have to change the
name you just click on like the no and
change the title so it's super super
nice this is by far my favorite app I've
only used this one though but it's so
easy and convenient and perfect that I
don't know why I would ever use another
app by the way this is not sponsored but
if notably it would love to sponsor me I
would totally take it because I love it
so much
via that except that you feel again like
you to look me like you're like I wrote
down all the stuff in and literally is
like my handwriting
let's see any other classes oh you can
import PowerPoint which is nice because
some of my lectures I have to like fill
in the blank you have for example is
like one of my lectures for a class and
as you can see I like wrote on it and
you can like zoom in and whatever and I
just downloaded this PowerPoint from my
account on the iPad but I went on Google
it went onto my school's website and
whatever we use and I downloaded it from
there you can download it from your
email whatever and I just filled in the
blank and wrote on my powerpoint so
that's super super nice like Here I am
writing on the PowerPoint so easy so
nice it's great so that's awesome I also
have an article that I had to kind of
analyze and I highlighted a bunch of
stuff so it's just so so so cool this
videos not very structured but I'm
trying to get all the main points this
is the main I want to focus on
if I use this app is $10 which is the
downside of it but for $10 I think it is
so so so incredibly worth it
I highly recommend app to anyone that
has an iPad pro that's like a gist of
kind of how I take notes so that I stay
organized my backpack is that was super
super light because all I take is this
super thin laptop to clap
I use it for basically everything except
to edit videos because I don't want to
end it on here even though you can with
iMovie I have final cut so I edit on my
laptop but yeah that is it for that
everything else is standard like if you
own an iPhone you will know how to use
it that is by far my favorite app highly
highly recommend that you can do so much
with this iPad and I would recommend
getting the Apple pencil instead of an
off-brand Warren just because of how
perfect it is I don't think that you can
get much better than this so I would
recommend it it is $99 though so it is
ridiculously expensive considering the
five times already expensive and you
have to purchase the pen or the pencil
they call it so yeah that is super
expensive and it is a downside but it is
so so great if you're making the
investment to buy an iPad pro you
definitely should buy the pencil or else
the iPad pro isn't really going to get
the greatest use that it could so yeah
that's it for how I do what I use my
iPad for how I take notes that is how I
take notes so take this to class the one
thing is you do need to remember to
charge your iPad and charge your pencil
before class your pencil can be charged
either in iPad which is nice or it has
its own charger that it comes with iPad
normal iPhone charger they give you one
when you buy it yeah highly highly
recommend that's it Vijay so much for
watching this video I mean for me that
you guys are actually here watching my
channel I know I don't they got a lot
because it's like I don't know really
where to put it in and disappoint be
with an awkward like to put it in by
some savings it so so so much I love you
guys and
like our amazing and thank you for 65
thousand subscribers I cannot believe we
are at that number and really that's
insane and yeah I can say thank you guys
so this is a random insert but random
sort of appreciation and I said yes it
was a video give a thumbs up if you like
this and be sure to stick around for
next week because we have pretty
exciting videos coming up actually like
I'm really eyes for the videos when
posting next week so I play it so yeah
