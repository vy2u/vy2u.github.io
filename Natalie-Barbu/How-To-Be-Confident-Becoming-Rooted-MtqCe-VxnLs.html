little different because I'm actually
filming on my vlog camera and also I'm
just sitting down really casual it's not
I don't have any lights up or anything
like that um they want to make this
video a little more personal and I just
kind of want to sit down with a friend
and talk to you guys because I consider
all of you guys my friends and I hope
anyone watching this feels the same way
but this video is also one of my
becoming rooted ones so this is not
today with like my beauty by not
Nathalie channel like it doesn't have to
do with that this has to do with
becoming rooted which is the website
that me and my friend Katie do so I will
have it linked down below so you guys
can see the full version and like the
full link of this video and you can also
comment on there and write a discussion
forum and just have a community with one
another I've talked about it before in
last week's video on Saturday and also
on the exciting launch announcement
video that I have on my channel so I
will link both of those down below so I
don't have to re-explain myself every
intro but yeah that's a mini version of
it
I kind of want to talk to you guys about
confidence and I wasn't sure what to do
in this week on becoming read it I just
didn't know what God was putting on my
heart and I didn't know when I should
talk to you guys about but as the week
went on um I just felt like this is
something I needed here and so maybe one
of you guys needs to hear this and we're
not trying to make this a super long
video but I just really want to talk to
you guys kind of just as friends so
basically confidence um where can I
start with this I don't even know
there's so many different topics on
confidence so many things like what is
confidence I don't even know how to put
a set definition on it but if I were to
say what confidence is it's just being
comfortable in your own skin
um not really caring about what others
think of you because you know that you
are rooted in something so much greater
than just the world's opinion on you and
I guess that is like the best
explanation that I have for it because
for me I struggle a lot well one I put
myself on the other in it not all of you
guys have this issue I know a lot of us
have social media and almost everyone
has social media so yes everyone puts
themselves on the internet but I am like
fully broadcasting myself onto the
internet like BAM Here I am a lot of
times I know with putting myself on here
I
comments and I will get a lot of
negative comments and they don't really
bother it bother me
I've come to kind of realize like it
doesn't matter like these people are
just hiding behind a computer screen
it's fine and that's even easy to say
with like people if you on your
Instagram picture if you like get mean
comments on people from your school or
people screenshot it and send it around
in a group message like I know nowadays
people don't really directly comment on
like an Instagram profile unless the
person is famous or they don't know them
and they won't say anything mean like
someone from your school chances are
won't comment on your profile and say
something mean but like they will say my
screenshot it and send it around in a
group message and that might come back
to you and that hurts it really really
hurts and you might say you didn't ask
for it and you didn't definitely did it
and some people say like oh me I asked
for I'm literally putting myself on the
internet like I asked for it and so
that's why I don't even know where I
started on this but I know that
confidence a lot of times when you get
those negative things it's hard to just
say I don't care I don't care I don't
care like doesn't matter they're just
hiding behind a computer screen or if
it's someone you know you can say
doesn't matter that means I'm better
like I'm it shows that you are the
bigger person when someone else is
trying to put you down I like to quote
like when someone's trying to put you
down that means that they're already
below you and I really really think
that's true if someone is really caring
what you think that much or caring what
you do or caring what pictures you post
that much that shows a lot more on them
than it does on you and I constantly
remind myself of that and it honestly
helps me a lot like it I know it hurts
and especially when a whole group of
people believe that person that oh yeah
that's an ugly picture or whatever it is
it hurts but just know that that shows
so much more than them then it does on
you and in a few years you won't even
remember any of that
but anyways again with confidence the
way I also view it is that I am not
rooted in what the world thinks of me as
much as I love getting likes on my
Instagram pictures and positive comments
and you guys telling me like nice things
about myself or nice things about my
video or I see that my work is being
noticed or anything like that anything
that
I build your confidence per se anything
that can build it that easily and that
quickly can that easily and quickly
bring it down and I think that's
something to really keep in mind that
when you are building your confidence
just fun likes you're building your
confidence just on positive comments
towards you or anything that the world
is giving you and by the world I mean
like people and objects and anything
literally on this earth then are just
giving you it can be quickly taken down
that fast and I think that shows that
it's not true confidence and I'm not
saying it's not to you that you're not
really confident even though you say you
are because you might be a confident
person but your confidence might do it
all and diminish that much as quick as
it went up God created me and he created
you and I know you've heard this a
million times it's like yeah yeah I know
I'm a beautiful child of God whatever
but it's not really whatever I know
because you hear so many times I might
feel that way but we are not meant to be
satisfied by just worlds like things and
by just people constantly feeding us
with compliments aren't you already
supposed to be satisfied and myself
included with the fact that there is a
magnificent God that created this whole
of universe that loves us and doesn't
want us to feel worthless just because
of one person's comment or because of
one person said something or even
because of ten people's comments and I
need to remind myself this yesterday you
guys yesterday I posted a new video and
it got a lot of negativity and a lot of
negative comments on it regardless
haven't had to do with me or the video
whatever it was I hate getting negative
comments and I usually do brush it off
but for some reason this week those
comments were just getting to me and I
was just wanting to some of them which
honestly I shouldn't have you shouldn't
feed negativity with negativity but I
was and I'm human but yeah I shouldn't
have done that
and it just really got to me for some
reason and I was talking to my boyfriend
and he was telling me how who cares what
those people think like it doesn't
matter if they're literally just people
behind the screen don't even feed into
them like
you're so much better than that they
don't know you you know I'm like
building up like just trying to make me
feel better but everything I was
thinking like how I cannot be this
broken up and this shaken by a couple of
words that random people that I don't
even know on the internet say about me
like what does that tell me about myself
if I cam show affected by that but I'm
not so affected by the fact that I have
a god and I have a family that loves me
and a God that loves me and a friends
that love me like how come when bad
things come at you all you think about
is the bad things but you don't think
about the good things in your life
I am so 100% guilty of that and I just
needed a reminder that there are so many
things that there are so many people
that love me and care about me and want
me to succeed and are truly like really
know me and know me who I know who I am
as a person and still love me even
though that you know me that says a lot
guys good people that love you love you
because of who you are not because you
post good pictures you know what I'm
saying like the people that you don't
know an Instagram the people that are
Instagram famous those people don't have
that many people that love them truly
you can't love someone through a screen
if you don't know them like just because
you think someone's pretty and you like
their pictures and they have like witty
captions doesn't mean that you love them
but people mix that up they work in the
society confidence with the amount of
the number underneath a picture and I
think that's so so sad so I don't really
know where the city was going but I just
really wanted to put that out there and
say that your confidence should not be
built on numbers and just humans
opinions on you you should know that you
are rooted something is so much greater
and that's actually how we came up with
the name becoming dead
we really liked that it mean it meant
like we are rooted in something greater
than what this world has to offer and I
know some of you guys watching this are
not Christians and I totally understand
that and I'm not trying to shove this
down your throat by the way but this is
what I believe and this is what I am
going to put out there for you guys
because
has helped me so if you guys are
interested in learning more about
becoming graded or Christianity or
anything like that please check out our
website email us we'll be happy to talk
to you guys but yeah I hope that this
video made sense and I hope that some of
you guys needed to hear this because
this is something that was lit just
placed on my heart while I was driving
and yesterday and last night I was like
you know what I don't even care what I
had to talk about today this is what I'm
gonna talk about because I feel like it
is so relevant and yeah I know this
might be a little shorter or I don't
know it's like 10 minutes but I don't
know what I'm gonna edit but yeah so I
hope that you guys liked this video and
even though it's super casual I'm just
like sitting it out of my release a
bleep share but yeah be sure to follow
the coming read on Instagram and if you
guys want to keep up with us and check
out the website and Kati is actually
