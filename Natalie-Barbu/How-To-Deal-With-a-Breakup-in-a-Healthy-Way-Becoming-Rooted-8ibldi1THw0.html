I will have it links down below so I
hope that all of you guys check it out
this is the first of my official
becoming rooted videos and really really
excited so basically I'm going to give
you a back story on what becoming rooted
is for all my viewers who did not see
that video and for anyone new watching
this video so becoming version is a
website that me and my best friend
created and it's a community for young
women and girls to just come together
and just express self-love it's
encourage each other empower one another
so it is just basically a community for
girls and we post I do videos every
other Saturday and my friend Katie does
blog posts every other Saturday and we
do them all on our own blogs and video
like channels and then we bring them
together on becoming rooted so we just
want a but like a bigger audience and we
want to reach more people and we also
kind of want to be in our own element so
that is the rundown of what exactly
becoming graded instead there's
discussion forum so after this video I'm
going to post a discussion forum on
there too if you guys want to talk about
this video or anything else you can also
do it in the comments below and Katie
and I will both be reading those so yeah
by the way this doesn't have to do with
my main channel but it is on my main
channel just to reach a bigger audience
if that makes any sense this video I
have been wanting to do for such a long
time and I've wanted to talk to you guys
about this and I feel like I'm like your
older sister sometimes or younger sister
I guess I have older viewers but I just
feel like I love venting to you but also
giving you guys advice so this is
basically a video to tell you guys how
to deal with a breakup in a healthy way
and just tips that I come up with and
things that I've seen that from friends
and through personal experience that I
think will save a lot of heartache for a
lot of you girls out there
breakups are never fun
I don't think anyone has ever been like
wow like I'm so happy after a breakup
like even if you're in an unhealthy
relationship you might feel relief and
you might feel relief about it and like
you might be happy that you're not in a
situation anymore but breakups always
take a little bit piece of a person they
just do like no matter how many times
you break up with someone they have a
little piece of you I'm convinced at
least through what I've seen please let
me know them wrong but yeah breakups are
never easy no matter who initiated it
even if you're the one breaking up the
person or you're the one hobbit
forgetting breaking being broken up with
that's not fun but even if you're the
one that initiated it you still feel
like sadness but something is over
something in your life that it's huge is
over and that's just hard no matter who
you are I'm going to give you a
backstory my relationship and they're
just because we kind of grew our
separate ways we weren't seeing
eye-to-eye on things anymore and
honestly we weren't seeing each other in
our future anymore and that to me is
like my biggest fear like loving someone
and then later down the road somehow the
love is gone I just looks like my
biggest fear our breakup was not a huge
big explosive site but it was really sad
because it was something like we
couldn't prevent it like it literally
was meant we just were not meant to be
with each other so I don't know I feel
like a lot of you guys are probably
going to relate to that I know a lot of
friends that have dealt with it and in
some ways that is better than like an
explosive breakup where you guys hate
each other but like at the same time
it's hard because it's like why like why
does this have to happen and like all
that stuff so tip number one that I have
is to allow yourself to be sad I know
this is kind of a what like I'm watching
this video so I'm not sad after a
breakup but no like you have first tip
is to allow yourself to be sad there is
a time for every single emotion and if
you are only trying to be happy
at all times a hundred percent of your
life being happy yes it's good to be
happy and I'm all about being positive
and trying to be happy as much as you
can but there isn't a time where you are
going to be fat
and breakups are one of those times so I
just think that it is even biblical of
maybe not it does not say thou shalt be
sad after a breakup but it is biblical
that there is a time to be sad there's a
time to cry there is a time to rejoice
there's a time to dance
there are times for things and there are
seasons for them and after a breakup I
think you should allow yourself to be
sad I don't think it's fair for your own
sake to be trying to force happiness on
something because it's just going to
come back later on later down the road
it's just going to come back and you are
going to feel those emotions that you
bottled up inside after me and my
boyfriend broke up I was crying for
about three days in a row I know that
sounds like what like that's a little
like much but I seriously was so sad I
yeah I cried for about three days in a
row and after that I felt so much better
I felt at peace about it I felt like
okay God all my sadness out I understood
I like deep lettuce resonating me let it
sink in like we're not together this is
officially over and I was felt better
afterwards
so after those three days of like crying
I never cried about it anymore honestly
and this is when I tell all my friends
when me and my friends talk about this
first thing I tell them is cry let it
out and don't try to push it back and
yeah I know a lot of friends are like
the data you break up with your
boyfriend they'll be like alright let's
come on we're going out we're going out
you're not going to think about it and
they obviously have good intentions but
I just think that it's not like if you
are going out at night going to a party
or something or just going to dinner
with your girlfriends and you're still
thinking about that we just listen to
magically go away so that's why I say to
allow yourself to be sad I think it's
honestly the best now don't want
yourself peace after with a month and
like never leave your bed for a month
like don't want this don't use this as
an excuse but in the beginning and
immediately like that's totally normal
and I think that it's healthy to feel
emotions the next tip that I have though
is kind of going to be contradicting my
first one but not really once I explain
it it's don't do well on it
so like I said don't stand that for a
whole month never doing anything like
you should not dwell on the past don't
dwell on like what if we stay together
or like what if I didn't do that or like
what if I did this or don't also
something that killed me was like
thinking of future plans so try not to
think about that as often as you can
because a lot of relationships don't
have a set like day that they're going
to end like you're not like okay like
we're going to end in a month you know
like it just like comes around and
you're like wow like this isn't where
it's going anymore and like we need to
end things but you still made plans with
that person you know at least in my case
like this boy I think it's hard looking
back and thinking like wow like if we
were still together we would be going to
the mountains this weekend or if we were
still together like we would be oh this
is what we did on Thursday nights or
whatever things like that like that's
not healthy to constantly think like
what if we were together what if I can't
do this what would have happened I think
that you should have a piece in your
heart of this happened for a reason and
I'm sad about it it's not always going
to be happy and fun and lollipops and
whatever but like it's also like there
was a reason for this so do not dwell on
it
excellent kind of goes along with what I
also said what you think about why I
ended and think thing about why I ended
in like the positive ways like it ended
because you didn't have anything in
common anymore why would you want to be
with someone that you don't have
anything in common anymore with and
obviously these are things that I'm
saying like from like a peaceful breakup
so let's say it was a huge blown-up
breakup and you found out that he's
cheating on you or you found out that he
was lying to you about everything or
thoughts like finding out something it's
like oh my god I cannot be with you
anymore
think about that see like oh I am I
deserve so much better like if you think
that you deserve to be with someone that
you don't get along with or if you think
to use them to be with someone that you
fight all the time or you think you
deserve to be someone that lies to you
or do you think you deserve to be with
someone that has nothing in common with
you even if they are a great person like
when you realize like I mean that person
we're not meant to be together like it's
just clear in so many ways
it's clear that me and that one person
grew apart and just we're not supposed
to be husband and wife basically and I
go through relationships I'm 20 years
old and so I'm at that point where I'm
like okay I don't want to be just dating
someone just to date like I want to kind
of have like a potential like I don't
view everyone it's like my future
husband but I view them as like a
potential to be that because all
relationships either end in breaking up
or marriage or being together forever
like if you don't get married like
you're together forever or you break up
let's think about that that's scary
think about the reasons I broke up this
is not something to be like I hate you
for this I hate you for this like you
smell bad you wear baby we're rude to my
sister or whatever like this is not like
a reason to hold a grudge against oh boy
so don't do this and like list a bunch
of reasons why you now hate your
ex-boyfriend and like you're like wow it
didn't realize that before I hate you no
but it's just to kind of think about it
like wow like I deserve someone who well
I don't know you just a nurse someone
that is meant for you and breakups show
that those that you were not meant for
that person it's kind of like a peaceful
thing like thank God that he has someone
better for you that hang with you think
about your feelings for that one person
that you just broke up with and God has
someone so much better for you than him
that's incredible like you could you may
have felt so in love with that person
and had the met best memories but just
wait there's something so much better
it's going to be someone so much better
suited for you and I think that's
actually really really encouraging
number four this one is something that
it's just like you should not do ever do
not stalk the person do not saw your
ex-boyfriend this is mainly through
social media don't stalk them in person
definitely but like don't talk about
social media either you're not that
person that they come to anymore about
to tell about their day that's going to
suck and that's going to hit and you're
like oh I wonder what they're up to
because I have no idea anymore and it's
so easy to social media to find out
every single thing about the other
person please don't do it
it is showing health
it makes you think things like if you
see someone like their picture and
you're oh my god like why did that girl
like his picture like it does that mean
they're dating now no it probably
doesn't but don't do that to yourself
and then you're on her page and then
you're creepin on her and seeing if they
communicate on her site like and don't
do it it's so unhealthy
thank God it's not chat deleted best
friends like so you can't see each
other's best friends because that stuff
I would look at I'd make myself go crazy
so yeah it's just like I'm like looking
back at some of the stuff I didn't I'm
like oh my god that'll be them and then
the last tip that I have is to talk
about it so I talked my ear off or toss
my friend's ears off probably I talked
to my mom about I talk to my friends
about it like it's healthy to talk to
someone about it but for me also I
prayed about it which so I talked to God
about it I just for me that gives me
peace I would try it out if I were you
guys but yeah talk someone bottling
things up is never good never once
advert has bottling up huge emotion like
that been a good thing people are meant
to talk to someone about it so if you
don't have anyone pray just let it I'll
just talk in your room by yourself pray
in your head write it down in a journal
just ask for peace that is my biggest
thing if you keep it bottled up inside
you're never going to allow yourself to
feel your true emotions and honestly
that's really sad so this video is so so
so long and I feel like I kind of like
mumbled over my words and we didn't even
know what to say and I'm kind of nervous
