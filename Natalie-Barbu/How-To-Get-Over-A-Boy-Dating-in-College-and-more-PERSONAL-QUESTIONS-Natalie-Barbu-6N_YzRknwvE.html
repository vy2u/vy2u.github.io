I am filming a very exciting video for
you guys so I am filming a Q&amp;amp;A and I
asked you guys on my Instagram story to
ask me any personal or interesting
questions because I feel like all of the
other q and A's I've done it's kind of
been like about me like questions about
me and I really wanted to answer some
like interesting questions some things I
never answered before or questions like
advice than you guys like want me to
answer that's what we're gonna do we're
gonna answer your questions I got so
many questions in my dns and I'm gonna
keep on anonymous cuz that's what I said
in my story that if you DM them I will
keep them anonymous just because if it
is advice questions I don't want to put
you guys on blast
so before I start this video I just
wanna let you guys know that I am doing
vlogmas I'm doing it on my blog channel
which many of you guys do not know about
so please go and subscribe to that and
also if you're new here please be sure
to subscribe because we are so close to
a hundred thousand you guys we're only
five thousand away and that is just
mind-blowing to me and once I hate a
hundred thousand I'm gonna do a huge
giveaway for you guys so please research
sure to subscribe that would make my
year if we hate 100k this year we might
not but it would just like be the best
thing ever so be sure to subscribe I'm
just gonna get started into the
questions this question is how do you
avoid a boy who keeps flirting with you
when you always see each other at work
he gives me all of the attention I've
been longing for but then I just found
out that you as a girlfriend just want
to ignore him but seems hard when your
work mates with that person any tips on
how to address the issue and completely
rejecting him without completely
rejecting him and shutting him down but
my first thing would be since it is like
work I get that you're saying like
without completely rejecting him but I
would honestly anytime he flirts with
you do not give him the time of day
don't flirt back don't like make it
super short honestly I would just ignore
him like look at him when he says
something and then just not saying
anything or something fun that you might
wanna try is he like so how's your
girlfriend just ask him about his
girlfriend and see how he reacts that's
what I would do next question is do you
have a lot of people wanting to be a
friend because you're a youtuber if so
how could you tell us genuine or fake
personally I don't think so I don't
think people want to be my
friend because of my youtuber or not I
think people like recognizing more like
I have had a lot of people come up to me
and be like oh hey you do YouTube videos
but no one's been like out of their way
of trying to beat my friend because of
that so no I wouldn't say so in general
how to tell genuine and fake friends I
could do like a whole video on this
basically if a friend is only there for
you when you're convenient for them
they're a fake friend I wouldn't
necessarily say people go out of my way
it's me my friend I don't think I'm that
cool but this next question is from
someone from UNC and if you guys watch
my blog I was actually at UNC and asked
if any of you guys go there to let me
know so thank you for letting me know
but she asked how I got started on
YouTube because she's a senior and
wanting to start but I'm a little scared
not sure about editing etc either way I
just want to say you're doing a great
job and I love your videos thank you so
much sir my biggest advice for starting
YouTube is just to start pick up your
camera pick up your iPhone and start and
upload after that it takes some work but
if you're scared have cold feet just
film a video and put it on the Internet
I know people are perfectionist you want
everything to be perfect and they won't
be able to watch their videos and to
like automatically like start a YouTube
channel and have a million subscribers
from the start and like unfortunately
that's not gonna happen
it's hard work on grow your subscribers
it's a lot harder than people may think
but my biggest tip for growing and
becoming better at editing is one look
up a lot of YouTube videos for how to
edit your videos that's what I did if I
want to try to make a cool title if I
want to see the way someone did a video
chances are there's a YouTube video on
how to do it so I would do that Google
is your friend Google everything
sometimes I know it's like tempting to
just like say you give up because you
don't know how to do it but not many
people like I didn't know how to do
anything when I first started you just
learn on your own and you will get
better with time and the thing I would
say is to be consistent so just as long
as you're uploading once a week I think
once a week is probably the minimum
truthfully as long as you're uploading
once a week then I think that you can
start growing your audience someone
message me how did you meet Carlin so if
you guys don't know Collin is my
boyfriend I just did a blog with him
he's in a couple of my blogs so be sure
to subscribe to my vlog channel but we
actually
you each other in high school and then
we just kind of stayed friends
throughout college it's kind of an
interesting story how we started dating
but I don't really want to say it like
on this little short like Q&amp;amp;A but ya
know we met in high school we didn't
date in high school we started dating my
sophomore year of college and yeah it
was interesting but I'm very happy with
how everything's worked out hi Natalie
here are some questions topics for your
Q&amp;amp;A I love you so much I love you guys
too I seriously thank you guys for these
Q&amp;amp;A I was not expecting how many I got
so thank you thank you thank you
question is just talking about how to
make friendships in college and how to
have a relationship in college how to
stay on track I got a lot a lot of
questions on friendships and
relationships in college I would say
that with friendships in college I've
said this in plenty of videos it's hard
because everyone's new and everyone is
like trying to become friends right away
so like you'll meet someone and then
automatically you guys are best friends
like after a week you're best friends
with the person and then after a while
you might start realizing like you might
not be as compatible as you thought or
you might not like honestly like the
person as much as sad as that is but
because it was so rushed in the
beginning and everyone was just trying
to be have friends that everyone just
like stuck together I don't know that's
the way I feel it call it works like the
complexities of it is like you're kind
of having fake friendships at first
because how real can a friend should be
if you've known each other for a week
you know on the outside it seems like
everyone's found their best friend and
everyone's in their clique and in their
circle and a lot of times people stay in
the circles that they were a freshman
year but they kind of like develop and
change but most of the time I've seen
people don't stick with the same friends
because they realize like they make
genuine friendships throughout years
like friendship takes time it's not
something that you're just thrown into
and your best friends automatically so I
would say to remember that when you see
everyone else and it might seem like a
lot of pressure because everyone else
has like their best friend and their
circle and whatever but my biggest way
of making friends is putting yourself
out there going to clubs going to
meetings keeping your a dorm room door
open for people on your Hall you know
just like going out and doing stuff and
not staying in your room all day that is
the
one way to make friends because everyone
there it's in the same boat as you
you're all freshmen in the beginning and
you're all trying to make friends so
really don't be like like that's the
number one way on how to meet people for
sure next question that I got a million
times I think I got so so many of these
questions is how do I see motivated in
school and how do i balance kind of like
YouTube engineering and relationships
and friendships and like my social life
so basically I had talked about this a
lot on my channel but I wanted to give a
little rundown for the people that are
new here I am an engineering major in
school I'm a senior I'm graduating in
May and that's crazy uh basically the
way I keep track of everything is I have
a schedule and I really really stick to
it so for me my typical day goes with
waking up at like 7:00 a.m. and I know
that's early and getting a workout in
because I really really really try to
get a workout in every single morning
during the week so I'll wake up then get
my workout and shower eat get ready and
then from there I have a schedule so I
really don't have free time during the
day I don't do much other than
schoolwork during the day or if I'm not
doing schoolwork I'm doing youtube so my
free time is typically at night like
just for like an hour before I go to bed
and throughout the day if I'm like on my
phone but basically I will go and I will
set myself up at like a Starbucks or a
hall that has like computers or like a
library and I will go and I will study
there as long as I can and I'll set a
limit for myself so ok I want to study
for 6 hours today or having to study for
like 8 hours today and I'll do that
which is why I like getting an early
start to my morning so basically my
entire chunk of my day goes with
studying so right now today I had on the
schedule that I was going to film a
night at this video
so yesterday I studied for a little
longer because they compensated for
today so I'm a planner I plan ahead of
time everything I have to do I plan
ahead of time so that is the only way I
can keep myself on track I do not do
things randomly like if someone's like
oh hey do you want to like go into the
mall today for like three hours
no because my schedules already filled
like realistically that's how I work the
tie function and ice how I have managed
to maintain YouTube engineering annum
social life next question is have you
ever had body insecurities and how do
you deal with it so I think because I'm
human I have had body insecurities I
feel like everyone definitely had I was
always super super skinny which I know a
lot of you guys are probably like
rolling your eyes like oh like poor you
you were skinny and but for me
personally that was an insecurity of
mine because I had literally no boobs
and I had literally no but like honestly
my but probably like concave day and
like it was just like it was not it was
I was a stick I'm gonna be super super
insecure because at that point I feel
like literally guys in high school only
care about like boobs and butts the main
thing that they would find like
attractive in a girl is like that so I
don't have any of that so for me I just
felt very very like unattractive I felt
like a little kid and then when I got to
college I made a workout schedule I
started my workout routine in software
year of college and I really wanted to
gain muscles so I started doing more
like I started lifting weights more and
I started going in the gym and having an
actual routine and now I can say I'm
very confident with how I look obviously
I have body insecurities of course
there's day so and I feel like
disgusting in there other days when I
don't feel disgusting but my main way to
look at it is that we're all human we
all have bodies and everyone feels
insecure the people that you think are
the most beautiful women like even
Victoria's Secret models I'm sure feel
insecure and like every single body is
different no one is gonna look the same
that is something that you we have to
remember like sure there might be people
that are super skinny and has the nicest
butt and like the skinniest legs and
you're just like how and that is because
they have a different body than you no
one will have the same body as you and
honestly if you are worried like I was
when I was in high school about like
guys thinking you're attractive or not
like those boys are so stupid if that is
what they find a tract like if that's
all they look for in a girl and you
don't even want the attention from those
guys so another question is what is the
your best advice for someone who is lost
slash doesn't know what to do but my
biggest advice for that whenever I'm
feeling that way is I pray so I will
open my Bible I will pray I will put on
worship music and I will just ask God
for clarity and for peace and for me to
feel calm about where I am at right now
in life and for him to guide me and kind
of open doors for what he wants me to do
so I just pray that I can follow his
plan and
he reveals his plan to me and trying to
just listen to God in those moments this
next question is I'm currently a senior
in high school and have been with my
boyfriend for two-plus years is it a
good idea for me to keep the
relationship when you go to college
obviously not gonna give you an answer
that's like oh break up a thing or yes
stay together with him because it
depends but for me personally what I
realized is if you're going to the same
College it's a lot easier if you're
doing distance obviously it's manageable
you can do it but it is harder and I
will give you this I don't know you I
don't know your boyfriend but when you
guys go to different schools typically
at freshmen go a little wild so the
freshman guys are like only thinking
about girls girls girls unlike freshmen
girls are being exposed to all of these
like older guys I'm just like alcohol
and parties and creepy guys honestly and
like people that are so many new people
like in high school you're kind of in
your bubble and you only know the
certain amount of people like on your
hand basically and in college you're
exposed to a whole new world so I will
say that it is a lot harder to date
freshman year of college because you're
exposed to so many new things that it's
just harder to kind of stay focused on
one person and obviously that does not
mean that he's gonna cheat on you it
doesn't mean that you're gonna cheat on
him but for my advice it is harder so
you really got to be secure in your
relationship and you got to figure out
how to make it work if you guys aren't
going distant but in the last question
that I'm going to answer is how do I
move on from a guy when he was the first
person that I loved but this one it like
is super complex question to answer and
I have a bunch of relationship videos I
keep like self-promoting myself but like
I feel like all of the on these can be
nice I'm like rushing at the surface and
if you go out the more in depth video
then go to that but it's harder because
I feel like your first love you will
always have a piece of them with you I
am a true believer in that I think that
you will always have a either whether
it's love or if it's just a caring for
that person like you will always care
for them definitely think that will stay
with you forever just because it was
your first time being even explaining
your heart up to someone else the best
way I would say is again to pray I know
if you're not a Christian and this might
seem like foreign to you but for me
personally what I would do is pray about
it pray
God can allow my heart to move on and to
heal and to not be sad anymore and to
have me realized the bigger plans that
he has for me and how that guy who just
was not meant to be in my life and the
second one is to stop talking to him I
know that's so hard but you will never
get over someone that is still talking
to you and it's still in your life and
even if you say that you're just friends
you might still be able to be friends in
the future but right when you're getting
over someone you can't be friends with
them because one of you or both of you
typically it's just one of you it's
still gonna have feelings for the other
and it's gonna get so much hurt when
they see one person moving on bastard
that's what I would do I think out of
sight out of mind is the best way to do
it and also time does heal also
eventually I gear down the road a couple
months on the road you're not gonna
still be feeling the same way that you
did a week after you broke up this video
is so so long and I need a study because
like I said it is finals week so I hope
