channel or wait I need to introduce you
first okay oh hey what's up guys welcome
back to my channel today I am here with
the Jess guys you guys have seen her in
my vlogs if you guys keep up with that
and we also did a collab a few months
ago so I feel like you guys just know
who she is already I'll have all of our
description or all of her links down
below in the description box so you can
check her out
today we filmed recreation of two
youtubers instagrams and I did summer
McKean and I did a Livia day and we both
trust these youtubers because they're
friends so they are both like super
pretty super nice love their YouTube
channels like they have really really
good instagrams so we just wanted to
recreate them so if you guys want to see
the rest of how we recreated their
instagrams and then keep on watching and
be sure to DM them so that they can see
this I really really want them to see us
in cm summer and DM Olivia okay
now let's get started guys this is the
first photo that we're gonna be doing so
I have our face masks on Jess and I both
do we're doing the picture with summer
and Olivia to start out with but this is
a selfie so we're just gonna take it
inside my apartment and we'll see Yoko's
a mask support like why don't you go
back and you smooth our mess yeah okay
so the picture turned out pretty good I
would say I think I would rate this one
like 7 out of 10 6 out of 10 something
like that so here is the recreation it
was a lot harder because there's like
two of us so we had to get like the
right angle for the both of us like if
one of us was wrong then the whole
picture was wrong and then also again I
don't have blue eyes and summer has like
the prettiest blue eyes so I'm gonna go
into facetune perfect 365 whatever I
need to do to do that to get myself to
look a little more like her but let me
know if you guys like to this picture
and I on to the next one
alright so now I'm doing the second
photo so this is summers hair and makeup
from what the best I could do in the
picture I feel like the Alpha is pretty
spot on I'm pretty sure she even has
this shirt on in the photo because she
always was brandy melville and this is
brandy melville I just had like a gold
charm necklace a little dainty one my
makeup is like super super Orange which
is just like her in the picture and then
I pulled out some pieces in the front
and put my hair in a high ponytail so
that I could match her and then my
earrings are not exact but I did the
best that I could with what I had but
hopefully the pictures turn out good
yeah let's see
alright here's my guess is how is she
holding it
this was shorter on her
I just finished filming summers
Instagram post it was so much harder
than I thought you guys I literally 10
30 minutes probably trying to take the
photo like I went outside took the photo
and then I didn't like it so I went back
outside and tried again and like editing
it alone took like another 30 minutes
because my eye colors are totally
different she was like super gorgeous
light blue eyes and I just have like
dark dark brown eyes so I had to go on
an app and at that and then the lighting
was a little off so we had to edit the
lighting a little bit and it was just so
much harder than I thought Jess and I
are dying now but I thought it would be
so easy so mad right now like I'm
pouting I thought it would be so easy
it's so much harder than I thought
but I think it's still like a challenge
which is cool here is the photo and how
it turned out after the editing and
everything like that I probably would
give myself because our hair is a little
different like I have like straight eye
bangs in front like actual short bangs
not just like long pieces in the front
it didn't look exact but honestly I
think it was like pretty good I would
say I'd give it like a 7 out of 10 I
think just because I think I got like
the right idea of it like the lighting
wise and stuff like that but our head
shape is totally different and our eyes
are different so that was a little
challenging now we are off to the next
photo and hopefully it's a little easier
because I think I'm done with selfies
and selfies are like the hardest parts
for the third photo of the day I'm doing
this picture of summer I have the exact
hoodie it looks like that she's wearing
and all her hair is is like up in a
ponytail it's like all her hair pulled
back so it looks pretty easy it's the
same makeup from the other picture
before she just wears a lot of orange
and like gold colors so hopefully we're
gonna take it on portrait mode try to
see if that works
but I think it should be good fingers
cross I think this one's gonna be so
much easier so let's go
alright guys I finished taking the
picture and editing it literally I did
so much work through the editing it's
insane but the editing is what makes the
photo so here is my picture I think it
actually was pretty good once I added it
like originally nothing like it but with
the lighting and the face tuning and the
perfect 3-6-5 thing it looked good I
would rate this one I don't know if it's
better than the last one maybe a 7 out
of 10 again or a 6 out of 10 just
because the background isn't perfect let
me know through all of these like
pictures what you guys think what you
guys like
I think is the best one I would want to
know and what you guys rate all of them
so give me a rating for each one but
yeah I think this is almost like a 6 out
of 10 it was good cuz like the hoodie
was the same but it was a totally
different lighting like I think she did
her as her in Golden Hour and I'm doing
mine at like 2 o'clock in the afternoon
so a little bit different oh my god guys
this video is so much harder than I
thought it's kind of ridiculous I really
didn't think it would be this hard
alright guys the last photo for me so I
am doing this photo of summer and it's
orange but I'm gonna tone it down on
Lightroom so to make this color orange
that's why I have like a pink lip and
pink flowers because we can turn them
down
I have her exact same a hat I believe
this is literally the exact same line
and I'm gonna take this jacket off and I
have a shirt that has like those cute
little white sleeves so let's hope
that's let's hope this is the one I'm so
excited
let your teeth like yeah like REI said
you have to turn your head a little bit
more that way
alright guys so I just finished the last
and final photo and it is by far my
favorite one that I did I copied her
flower picture it's hard just to find
the location because I had to find a
location with flowers and orange flowers
around here are kind of hard to find so
we found actually a pink flower bush and
then I wore like hot pink lipstick and
then toned it down on lightroom so
that's how we got the orange colors
which was super super like that was so
easy to do and then I like photoshopped
way more flowers into it so I will show
you my final photo the before picture
first because you guys are gonna be like
Natalie that literally looks nothing
like the photo you like to such a bad
job and here is the after photo and I
just think it looks so much better on
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
another speed right there going so hard
the after photo looks so much better and
it looks so similar to the actual photo
I think this is definitely my favorite
one I'm gonna rate this one a 9 out of
10
let me know which one was your favorite
I just think this one like I got all the
positions right and like the Hat was the
same and everything like that but yeah
just comment down below your favorite
this was definitely mine and since this
is the last photo I'm going to be
closing off the video here I really hope
that you guys enjoyed it I loved filming
it it was so hard but it actually was
like a good way to end the day I feel
like and it was really fun and go watch
Jessa's video go watch Jessa's video it
is going to be a recreation of Olivia
Jade's Instagram so be sure to watch
that and please send this video to
summer I really really want her to see
it I just think that would be really
cool if she could see it and yeah just
DM her comment on her videos comment on
her Instagram post anything like that if
you do be sure to DM me and let me know
but yeah I think that's it and I really
to say if any of you guys want to
recreate my Instagram's that would be
really cool so really want someone to
recreate mine so if you do DME and I
will 100 million percent see it so yeah
all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
