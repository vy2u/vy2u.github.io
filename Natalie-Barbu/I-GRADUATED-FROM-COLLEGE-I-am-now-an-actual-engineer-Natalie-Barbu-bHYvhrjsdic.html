this is so weird today I am graduating I
wanted to do this vlog on my main
channel so guys are watching this and
you're new here hey I'm Natalie I'm
graduating from college today and it's
friggin weird it's weird I don't know if
I like it I'm like so confused it's so
many mixed feelings um but I also love
joy and also if you like this channel
then or if you like this video then you
can subscribe to my vlog Channel um but
yeah I felt like appropriate to put this
on my main channel because you guys have
been with me throughout my whole college
experience you guys have loved my
college videos and it's kind of like the
end of an era
so trying to like cry through those ears
or know that made no sense trying to
smile faces here's trying to smile
through the sadness I don't know also I
just filmed I get ready with me on this
makeup look so that will be up on my
channel probably after this I don't
really know when it'll be up funny ways
I'm just I'm just sad it's weird I'm
also moving out of my apartment today I
have to try on my dress
I haven't even ever tried on my dress
that I'm wearing today and then look I'm
wearing it like today so I love when the
dress I'm planning on wearing is
see-through like you can see the Spanx
under Neath I feel like I don't know if
you guys can see on camera but like yeah
like here's the end of my Spanx and
here's the beginning of my Spanx and you
can 100% see them like whoo when people
will design these dresses like who would
wear this whoo if it's so see-through
and also why am I an idiot and why
didn't I try it on before this I don't
know I don't know this is my outfit that
I'm wearing to brunch I decided to wear
the dress I'm just gonna go my some
underwear that's like see-through or
like that won't be see-through with the
dress after brunch but I'm wearing this
and then this cute little necklace it's
just a romper from Ali's closet I have
no idea where it's from and then I'm
wearing these wedges these nude wedges
so there's the fit got my hoop earrings
on they're like the classier ones
they're not as big we're off to brunch
first and then graduation I didn't even
know like what time graduation was I
know is that 2 o'clock but I didn't
realize
like we I knew that we had probably had
to get there early but like I delete all
the emails from like my advisors cuz I
just like never read them bow throughout
all the four years I've just been like
deleting the emails and now I guess when
it's like about graduation it's actually
been important stuff so I feel like an
idiot I'm gonna ask my friend I'm like
so like what time it's graduation like
what time do we have to be there I'm
like how am i graduating college ID
beats me this looks so good like a hex
benedict ish with CJ instead of
pork-belly Chloe got churro waffles and
she's vlogging don't don't pop it I'll
be there wait yeah let's pop it on
camera yeah yeah here is my graduation
outfit just got back from brunch
somewhere in this white dress from
revolve I don't remember the brand name
but I found an underwear that actually
wasn't see-through so this is what I'm
wearing it's really really cute and just
like a delicate white dress and then I'm
wearing my mom's heels I was gonna wear
the ones I wore the ones I wore for
pictures but these are way more
comfortable and I am so afraid of
tripping onstage so this is fine they're
just like a little big but they're
really comfy some hoops and here's the
graduation look Here I am in my cap and
gown these hats are like the ugliest
most unflattering thing everyone else to
wear but it's fine Ellie who went
through this last semester my mom's just
taking photos but yeah about to go
graduate whoo

packing in my room and now everything's
gone like it's hitting me more but I
just want to say thank you guys so much
I love you with all of my heart I just
like love you guys don't watch you guys
they're like my biggest supporter is
when I'm like my number ones like you
guys are just amazing um I'm just really
sad I'm really sad that I will never be
back in here for the same reason like I
was talking to Ali today it was like her
last I like laying in her bed talking
like nothing we're not gonna be friends
like she's coming to LA you know like
she'll visit me like we're gonna stay in
touch obviously like we're gonna visit
each other back and forth but like it's
just like it was the last time as
roommates I'm like what in a year it has
been seriously we've seen each other
there's so many moments like meet my
other roommates too it's like the exact
same way and like also just I'm never
gonna be in Raleigh for the same
like yes I'm gonna come back to Raleigh
I know it's not gonna be my last time in
this city but like I'm never gonna be
here for the same exact reason again I'm
never gonna see the people again that I
saw today like I it's just the last time
and it's really really really really
really really really sad
and it's so bittersweet and weird cuz I
don't feel like I'm this old like I know
I'm 22 I know I'm graduated I know I got
like finished my degree took all the
classes passed all the classes it just
doesn't feel like I am ready for that
save gia and I know I feel like it
doesn't feel like that for a lot of
people I'm not the only one I'm not
special about that but it's just
absolutely crazy to me that I'm done and
it's for real this time so just thank
you guys for following me along this
journey hope you enjoyed my babbles I
truly could not have gone through
college without you guys like they were
so I don't I'm thinking back to my
freshman year and like there were so
many low low low moments of college like
so many low moments not I mean not like
mostly but there was just so many
moments where I felt like so alone and
like like I didn't feel like I had good
friends here because I had such a group
of friends at high school and like I
felt like my friends here we're just
like not as real because I didn't know
them as long and like the friends we
made in the beginning and just like I
just I didn't feel like I was that happy
in college and everyone else thrives in
college especially like my freshman year
and I was going through breakups and
just like I just feel like I didn't
really know myself and I like started
pouring so much of myself into youtube
in college like I feel like whenever
people are like when did you start
YouTube and I tell them I started in
high school I did some field right to me
like so that's why I've been starting to
tell people like well like I started
being serious about YouTube in college
because in high school I feel like I
didn't post that many videos and now I'm
like post and like in college I got
serious Maotai and it's literally what
like got me through and what made me
like sick to my major what made me keep
going in college what made me like not
fall into a depression and like you guys
have so much of an effect on me that's
why people are like I
people say this I know it's like just
insecurities in my own head but I may
not be the biggest person on YouTube
I may not grow as fast as other people I
may not make the most money I may you
know it like how the most Instagram
followers like whatever no but that
doesn't matter to me like I just you
guys have helped me through so much and
I'm so happy I feel like I have like a
real connection with you guys as cheesy
as that sounds I truly feel like we know
each other and we're friends and I can't
say that about everyone else I have no
idea how other youtubers feel but I just
like feels so so grateful and loved and
I just want to thank you guys because
you guys are with me throughout this
whole experience and I don't care about
being dramatic it's my turn to be
dramatic I just finished a chapter of my
life so I hope you guys enjoyed this
