I am coming to you guys with a video
that is basically kind of like a life
update / what the heck i have been doing
this past week because if you guys
follow me on my social media you guys
probably saw that i was at the YouTube
space in New York which is all get to
that very exciting ouch in New York for
a while and in my past blog I was
telling you how happy I was and I didn't
tell you exactly why so I'm here to
address all of those questions and to
give you guys a life update because I
fee like I'm done one of those in a
while and this is so long overdue I get
a ton of questions in my comments just
about random things so I decided to make
a whole video addressing it so if you're
new to my channel stick around to kind
of see where this channel is headed I am
going to start with posting videos every
Tuesday and Friday so that's really
exciting for me if you guys up days that
you would rather me do let me know
because I'm just trying out Tuesday
Friday first so twice a week but yeah be
sure to subscribe to my channel and
comment down below and video requests or
what days you guys would think work best
for you so without further ado I'm just
going to get started until you guys
about my week in New York so if you guys
don't know already I was chosen as one
of the winners for the next step
competition at YouTube holds so this was
the second next up in New York this year
so I think they had one like five years
ago or something like that and then they
kind of brought it back this year and
this is the second round that they did
it in New York they do it in all the
YouTube spaces I think they've only done
New York in LA but they're starting to
do it in like wherever there's a youtube
space like London Berlin Tokyo that all
those places I'm pretty sure but yeah
i'll have the website link down below so
you guys get back gently i have applied
for that and i was a winner for it and
you guys I don't think you understand
how happy I was I think I could have
broke down and cried when I read that
email I was so so so so ecstatic um
basically they just shows up and coming
youtubers so anywhere with between
10,000 and 100,000 subscribers and that
they felt like they wanted to invest in
so I was chosen
which it's like why me I don't know I'm
not dissuading but thank you thank you
God basically it's a production camp so
I got to learn about lighting audio
which by the way I don't have a mic
because I just ordered all my tank
equipment and but so far i'm just using
the camera mic which my audio will be
getting a lot better you guys so rest
assured it will be getting better
because i just like video quality camera
production on camera but they just
basically taught us how to make some
dope i can't even say that thank you
sounds make some great videos yeah
that's it that's the third great not so
i should never use the word dope again
in my life they taught us how to do all
that stuff so we learned from basically
the best people out there so there was
people that taught us the guy that
taught us how to do lighting he is the I
think he's the only guy that Barbara
Walters let's light her sets like no big
deal she started named roneld person was
just like Oh some guy teaching his
lighting this is like awesome thanks our
name dropping things that you did he did
like peanut Barbara Walters he did Oprah
he did like that interview recently with
Donald Trump and megan kelly like he
went that like it's just so cool like
he's interacting with so many davis
people but we also had mentors that
worked at the YouTube space which were
so awesome my mentor was Andy she was
great she was just hands-down the best
mates were there in my opinion who
basically the audio group so ours mainly
wanted to work on audio and then we also
had like video projects in a video
challenge that we presented to everyone
at the end and let me tell you guys i
will be showing you guys that video if
you stay tuned to land but i'll show you
guys what i did but it was just like oh
my i can't even say more good things
about it was just amazing it was such an
amazing week I feel like I came back a
new person I learned so much and please
go subscribe to every single person's
channel all of them will be linked down
below they are seriously incredible
people like I don't think we had a
greater group of people than the ones
that they chose for this week like we
were in the best YouTube Nextup group
and I mean I know
like it's hard to get better than what
we had it was just amazing we got along
so well even though all of our channels
were so different so there was like
people that did woodworking there was a
chef there was um people that did
animation my roommate Hannah she's
awesome go subscribe to her she does
animation videos so like they're really
funny kind of cartoon animation things
which is totally different than what I
do look I didn't even really know that
that was only YouTube to be honest which
I'm so embarrassed about lead I knew
there were different categories but like
I never really watched the other ones so
I was so closed off into like just
beauty world then there was also people
that did Beauty so like I actually am
colliding with kyla he was there shout
out to you our next video will be a
collab so be sure to watch that but it
when it comes out doing so many like do
this do that like call to action things
I'm just really really excited and it
was the best week of my life I'm not
kidding it was the best week of my life
not only was it to new york city but it
was a YouTube space I go to connect with
other youtubers and youtubers have this
thing we're like basically I can get
along with almost all youtubers because
we all understand each other so we all
have that mutual understanding us with
my friends they understand me they
support me but like they don't really
understand what it's like to be too
weary not like oh we go through so many
hardships but it's just the back were
like you we're all passionate about the
same thing even though we have to her
interest which is show so incredible so
I got chosen to do that which is around
beyond me but and then they gave us a
2500 dollar gift card to be an age
coming into it I thought that that would
be the best perk and don't get me wrong
if it was an amazing purchase but I
really just wanted meeting everyone and
get in the experience like I will never
have those a once-in-a-lifetime
experience for me I thought it was so
incredible what YouTube is doing they
made us feel so fuckin special I felt
like a million bucks going out of there
like they took us they gave us breakfast
lunch and dinner they took us out to
really nice dinners they made us have
like fun activities um they just treated
us like we were already like famous
people I don't know it was just really
really cool they did such an amazing
good job I don't have any negatives to
say about it like and I think the only
thing I wish was that it was two weeks
like I wish it was longer we can do is
so fun and the YouTube space is so nice
um it's just like the coolest place I
want to go to the one in LA I'm going to
enlight it's my friend step in two weeks
so maybe I can like go to the YouTube
space la I didn't know it'd be so cool
but so if my video quality starts
getting better you guys know why because
it is just like I mean make it was funny
to have like amazing equipment so i
thought some i got a mic I got a drone
do you guys like I'm gonna my trance my
little but my travel Diaries hey Pat
Toomey care about me dope I'm sorry just
we forget things of that that was enough
like update my bios in New York I also
with the weekend before with my
boyfriend if you guys will see a blog
about that then yeah i'll have that
linked down below and you like click up
here there's gonna be a little card that
pops up yeah go watch it um that was
like on and then the week after that I
actually my friends keep up to New York
City and we all say to my friends Zacks
mom's apartment it was the best week of
my life and in tomorrow colossus starts
no that sucks i cannot believe i have
not had a single break because if you
guys don't know i also had an internship
this summer so i entered with Ralph
Lauren in High Point North Carolina and
that was basically like the e-commerce
site so if you guys win the US and you
guys buy anything from a floor calm that
comes from where I worked so i probably
dealt with the people that packed your
package and knows maybe I even pack 6
like we did pack a few so good that's
very words I am an engineering major so
I got to work with like the engineering
team there it was great it was fun it
was a good corporate experience
definitely next year I'm first you're
only applying to places in New York
though like that is where I want to be
oh I should be there and who knows what
next year will bring like this year was
just such makes it here you guys mean
