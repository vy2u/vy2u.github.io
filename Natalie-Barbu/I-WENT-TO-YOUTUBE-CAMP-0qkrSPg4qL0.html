I am coming to you guys with a video
that is basically kind of like a life
update slash what the heck I have been
doing this past week because if you guys
follow me on my social media you guys
probably saw that I was at the YouTube
space in New York which is I'll get to
that very exciting out in New York for a
while and in my past blog was telling
you how happy I was and I ain't going to
tell you exactly why so I need to
address all those questions and to give
you guys a life update because I feel
games I'm one of those in a while and
this is so long overdue I get a ton of
questions in my comments just about
random things so we decided to make a
whole video addressing it so if you're
new to my channel stick around to kind
of see where this channel is headed I am
going to start with posting videos every
Tuesday and Friday so that's really
exciting for me if you guys updates that
you would rather me do let me know
because I'm just trying out Tuesday
Friday first so twice a week but yeah be
sure to subscribe to my channel and
comment down below and video requests or
what days you guys would think work best
for you so without further ado I'm just
going to get started until you guys
about my week in New York so if you guys
don't know already I was chosen as one
of the winners for the next up
competition that YouTube holds so this
was the second next up in New York this
year so I think they had won like five
years ago or something like that and
then they kind of brought it back this
year and this is the second round that
they did it in New York they do it in
all of the YouTube spaces I think
they've only done New York in LA but
they're starting to do it in like
wherever there's a YouTube space like
Glenda and Berlin Tokyo that all those
places I'm pretty sure but yeah I'll
have the website link down below so you
guys can fact check me I've applied it
for that and I was a winner for it and
you guys I don't think
understand how happy I was I think I
could have broke down and cried when I
read that email I was so so so so
ecstatic basically they just shows up
and coming you tubers so anywhere with
between 10,000 and 100,000 subscribers
and that they felt like they wanted to
invest in so I was chosen for that which
it's like why me I don't know I'm not
this lady but thank you thank you God so
basically it's a production camp so I
got to learn about lighting audio which
by the way I don't have a mic because I
just ordered all my tank equipment and
but so far I'm just using the camera mic
which my audio will be getting a lot
better you guys so rest assured it will
be getting better because just like
video quality camera production on
camera but they just basically taught us
how to make some dope some great yes
yeah that's it that's that's the word
great not so I should never use the word
dope again in my life
they taught us how to do all of that
stuff so we learned from basically is
the best people out there so there was
people that taught us the guy that
taught us how to do lighting he is the I
think he's the only guy that Barbara
Walters let's light her sets like no big
deal inserted named Ron that person was
just like oh so 19 his lighting was like
awesome they don't name dropping things
that you did he did like he knows
Barbara Walters he did Oprah he did like
that interview recently with Donald
Trump and megyn kelly like he lit that
like it's just so cool like he's
interacted with so many famous people we
also had mentors that worked at the
YouTube space in which were so awesome
my mentor was Andy at she was great she
was just hands-down the best mentor in
there in my opinion who basically the
audio group so ours mainly wanted to
work on audio and then we also had like
video projects and a video challenge
that we presented to everyone at the end
and let me tell you guys I will be
showing you guys that video if you stay
tuned till the end but also you guys
what I did but it was just like oh my I
can't even say more good things about it
it was just amazing it was such an
amazing week I feel like I came back a
new person I learned so much and please
go subscribe to every single person's
channel all of them will be linked down
below they are seriously
incredible people like I don't think we
had a greater group of people than the
ones that they chose for this week like
we were in the best YouTube Nextup group
and I mean my brother on the like it's
hard to get better than what we had it
was just amazing we got along so well
even though all of our channels were so
different so there was like people that
did woodworking there was a chef there
was people that did animation my
roommate Hannah she's awesome go
subscribe to her she does animation
videos so like they're really funny kind
of cartoon animation things which is
totally different than what I do like I
didn't even really know that that was on
with YouTube to be honest which I'm so
embarrassed about they don't do there
were different categories but like I
never really watched the other ones so I
was so closed off into like just beauty
world then there was also people that
did Beauty so like I actually am
climbing with Kailah he was there
shoutout to you our next video will be a
collab so make sure to watch that but it
when it comes out doing so many like do
this do that like called
action things but I'm just really really
excited and it was the best week of my
life I'm not kidding it was the best
week of my life not only was it to New
York City but it was a YouTube space I
got to connect with other youtubers and
youtubers have this thing we're like
basically I can get along with almost
all youtubers because we all understand
each other so we all have that mutual
understanding this with my friends they
understand me they support me but like
they don't really understand what it's
like to be too very not like we go
through so many hardships but it's just
the back but like you we're all
passionate about the same thing even
though we have different interests which
is so so incredible so I got chosen to
do that which I'll be on me but and then
they gave miss a $2,500 gift card to be
an aged coming into my I thought that
that would be the best perk and don't
get me wrong if it was an amazing perk
but I really just love meeting everyone
and getting the experience like I will
never have those of once in a lifetime
experience for me I thought it was Shawn
credible what YouTube is doing they made
us feel so special I felt like a
million bucks going out of there like
they took us they gave us breakfast
dinner they took us out to really nice
dinners they made us have fun activities
of they just treated us like we were
already like famous people I don't know
it was just really really cool they did
such an amazing amazing job and I don't
have any negatives to say about it like
and I think the only thing I wish was
that it was two weeks like I wish it was
longer we can do this so fun and the
YouTube space is so nice um it's just
like the coolest place I want to go to
the one in LA I'm going to LA it's my
friend step in two weeks so maybe I can
like go to the YouTube space la I didn't
know it'd be so cool but so if my video
quality starts getting better you guys
know why because it is just like I mean
they gave us money to have like amazing
equipment so I thought some I got might
I got a drone you guys it's like I'm
gonna my triumphs my but my travel diary
hey that's me that was enough like
update that BIOS in New York I also with
weekend before with my boyfriend if you
guys want to see a vlog about that then
yeah I'll have that linked down below
and you can like click up here this will
be a little card that pops up yeah go
watch it
um that was like on and then the week
after that I actually my friends came up
to New York City and we all say to my
friends
Zak's mom's apartment it was the best
week of my life and then tomorrow
collapses stars know that stuff I cannot
believe I have not had a single break
because infinite know I also had an
internship this summer so I entered with
Ralph Lauren in High Point North
Carolina and that was basically like the
e-commerce site so if you guys live in
the US and you guys buy anything from a
floor calm that comes from where I
worked so I probably dealt with the
people that packed your package and who
knows maybe I even packed six like we
did pack with you so yeah that's very
words I am an engineering major so I got
to work with like the engineering team
there it was great it was fun it was a
good corporate experience definitely
next year I'm a first year only applying
to places in New York though like that
is where I want to be oh I can be there
and who knows
next year we'll bring like this here was

absolute world to me none of this would
be possible without you like literally
none of this YouTube would never have
thought to invest it in me without you
