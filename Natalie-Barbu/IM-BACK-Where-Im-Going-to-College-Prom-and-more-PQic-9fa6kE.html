from you after not making videos for
such a long time I'm gonna be summing
this video kind of letting you guys know
what I've been up to my life how it is
today the guys are interested and I'm
now doing a video like this before so
this is a first for me kind of just
sitting down and talking to you guys
about my life I don't really like doing
the videos like that just because I feel
like you guys aren't interesting not
like I feel like I get a bad vibe from
you but I just can't see how anyone
would be interested on what I'm up to
but I feel like I owe it to you guys
just because I have been absent for such
a long period of time and maybe a video
or two has come in between but honestly
probably this past year you guys have
been like wondering kind of where I am
and why haven't I posted and the reason
I haven't boosted is just because I
haven't been in the mood to make a video
and I feel like if I'm not in the mood
and I'm not wanting to make a video it
will come across in my video you guys
will be able to tell that I'm not
enjoying it and I don't want that to
happen so I am getting kind of like the
passion to start filming again and that
is really really good and I just because
I've been I haven't even wanted to watch
YouTube videos online like even when
you'd like subscribers or people I
subscribe to like pop-up of my youtube
homepage it's just like I haven't even
wanted to watch them so I just have kind
of been in YouTube funk lately but I
feel like I'm getting back into it so I
hope that I can redeem myself and if you
guys have video requests leave them in
the downbar below because I want to do
them and I kind of need ideas so any
requests please leave them in the
downbar below and I hope that I can
start making videos again for you guys
that you guys will enjoy and I really do
think that this new videos will be
coming soon to yeah so um yeah this
video is pretty much just gonna be about
what I'm doing in the future my plans
what I've been up to so I'm just gonna
get started into this and I have been
wanting to do a college video for you
guys for so so long so if you guys kind
of want me to expand on college let me
know so I can do kind of a tip
you guys for college but I've wanted to
tell you guys where I'm going to college
for so long and kind of do a college
video on it but I haven't known for a
long time where I'm going because I've
always been kind of exciting between two
schools waiting to hear back from
another one so for the long time I was
in between NC State and Clemson and I
only applied to four schools so I kind
of wish I applied some more but whatever
I only applied to four schools I applied
to University of Miami which is in Miami
Florida and I actually got deferred from
Miami so I didn't get in which kind of I
was bummed out about but whatever it
wasn't really my top choice so it's way
too expensive to go there but I got
deferred from Miami and so I didn't even
send in my mid-year grades just because
I was like I'm not gonna go there anyway
so I don't even know if I would have
gone in I feel like I would have gotten
in but um yeah so I just didn't even
send in my mid-year transcript because I
didn't I knew I wasn't gonna go there so
I got I applied to Miami and then I
applied to Virginia Tech and actually
haven't heard back from them yet but I
don't want to go there so I don't really
care if I hear back from them or not
like obviously I want to hear back from
them but hearing back from them is not
gonna be a decision maker or breaker for
me
so Virginia Tech I applied and then I
applied to Clemson University which is
in South Carolina and NC State
University which is in the capital of
North Carolina and I have for the
longest time I wanted to go to Clemson
that was my dream school in other videos
I have mentioned it before I really
wanted to go to Clemson and I got into
Clemson and so I was so excited when I
got in and I also got into NC State and
I never really wanted to go to NC State
that bad
and so I toured both the schools and I
actually ended up really really liking
them but I loved Clemson and but then
the more I thought about it as senior
year progressed the more I thought NC
State was a little bit more realistic
for me and so I did a retour of it and I
loved it I loved the city I loved the
campus I loved everything about it and I
still like think Clemson's campus is
nicer NC State's is more kind of in the
city Clemson is more of its own college
campus but I really did I loved
Clemson's campus I will give it that
Clemson's campus is nicer than
State to me but anyways I really love
the City of Raleigh and outside of
Clemson there's not really a city it's
kind of in the middle of nowhere and
then you have to take a highway get up
and exit and then you're in another city
but NC State is in the heart of Raleigh
two minutes away there's a really nice
strip of shopping and like you know that
that appeals to me and so I was thinking
about it and as much I loved NC State
its in-state tuition and Clemson is out
of state so I wouldn't be getting in see
tuition to Clemson so is it worth it to
go to Clemson and pay that money for
out-of-state or is it worth it to go to
NC State pay in-state tuition and get a
really good education and somewhere that
I really like and so I was thinking and
NC State was the obvious choice for me
so I am actually going to NC State in
the fall I'm very excited I'm majoring
in industrial engineering then even guys
were wondering I've always been a big
math person and many of you guys may
think I'm going into fashion or
something like that I might choose to
double major in industrial and textile
engineering just because they take a lot
of the same classes but I'm not sure yet
I really do want to still stick to
fashion I think I'm gonna join some
fashion club or something because NC
State is big into fashion too so that
was kind of another choice also NC State
has a lot of things that kind of appeal
to me like clubs that I would relate to
and Clemson's a lot more sporty which is
all which is really cool like that's
their things but like my I'm not into
sports so that's why an NCC is still big
on sports with like their football team
and basketball team so I can still
tailgate and everything like that
so enjoy college you know and so I'm in
doing Industrial Engineering and I might
make double major in textile engineering
or like do a minor something like that
but I'm not exactly sure but yeah I'm
going to NC State in the fall and I'm
very
I have actually already found my
roommate so I'm super excited about that
I joined the Facebook page and she's
from Pennsylvania and she seems like a
really cool like awesome girl and like
we have a lot in common so I'm very
excited for that and I asked I have
actually found some sweet mates - well
not for sure but like we're talking to
them and stuff so yeah I'm pretty much
all set for the Fall and so other than
that my life is pretty much been the
same I have new friends and stuff like I
still have my old friends obviously but
like I've just been mingling with people
and like having a good senior year
senior year is a lot of fun guys I'm not
gonna lie to you senior years awesome
it's probably my best my favorite year
so far just because knowing your senior
and knowing her at the very end of the
road and like you're about to graduate
like after this like um the other week
we had freshmen sophomores and juniors
registering for classes and I we didn't
have to register and it was just kind of
a weird feeling because every single
year I always register for classes pick
out what I'm gonna do next year and now
I'm not registering for classes at my
high school I'll be registering
registering for classes I like I don't
even know when do you register for
classes like orientation or something I
honestly have no clue so I'll be
registering for classes later on and I
know it's just weird and for picture day
look we didn't have picture day this
year because we took pictures in the
summer except I didn't take pictures in
the summer so I actually technically
didn't have a picture day during the
school thing during like the school day
but everyone else had it in the summer
and I don't know it's just like we're
talking about our caps and gowns and
graduation tassels and like diplomas and
our cords like if you're a part of any
like Honor Society or anything like that
I'm like it's just crazy feeling like
knowing that there's no one above you
like walking in the hallways and seeing
only people that are younger than you
like you don't see anyone older than you
like last year I walked by and and see
like oh hey they're seniors they're
going to college next year oh my gosh
they're so lucky like or like if I was a
freshman I'd be like oh my gosh like
head down look I remember being a
freshman and I would sit next to like my
group of girlfriends would sit right
next to a group of senior football
players and that was just like oh my
gosh like like we were all like so
scared
freshmen like sitting next to senior
football players like that was a huge
deal you know and now we're them and I
don't mean myself as scary or
intimidating I don't think anyone should
I'm like five foot three barely like if
even if I put three is generous I'm like
five three like short small not a scary
person at all so like most freshmen are
taller than me already so I mean my
little seventh-grade sister is taller
than me so yeah we could my fifth-grade
brother is as tall as me like I'm not a
scary person but like I am that person
now and it's just crazy and if you guys
aren't seniors yeah or if you guys have
graduated um like you guys have
graduated already I'm sure you guys know
this feeling and you guys are probably
know salad right thinking of this but I
mean it's a crazy feeling like I'm not
gonna be here next year like this is my
last year in this classroom I need to
cut it gives you kind of a sense to make
the most of it um if you guys have
cliques at your school our school used
to be kind of very cliquey like freshman
sophomore in junior year by senior year
those clicks are done like you still
hang out with your group of friends
obviously if you guys want to get lunch
or something you're not going to invite
the entire senior class but like Friday
nights at like bonfires or like at
people's houses like you would invite
everyone because everyone is friends
with everybody like eat so you don't
have any more clicks anymore you don't
have the groups like that like the drama
anymore like we haven't had any drama we
haven't had any like bad like friend
issues or anything cuz people realize
it's senior year we're not gonna see
like we're not gonna be here again like
we are this is our last year here we're
leaving we're never gonna see each other
like it hasn't hit me that pretty much
95% of my class I'm never gonna see you
again like a lot of people from high
school go to NC State but it's a big
enough school that I never have to see
them again if I don't want to like it's
that type of thing obviously I still
want to keep in touch with my close
friends and a lot of my friends are
going to NC State and like Chapel Hill
which is 30 minutes down the road so
it's I mean that we'll still see each
other if we want to keep in touch which
I do want to keep in touch but like my
best friend is going to University of
Virginia and that's five hours away look
is crazy how I'm not gonna see her
everyday and it kinda makes me really
sad because that's not like the type of
thing that you can just visit on a
weekend like you can visit your family
like we're gonna be separated we're
gonna have to keep in touch by the Skype
and texting and it's gonna be weird
thinking hey when are you in town so we
can keep up like right now we live
literally two minutes away from each
other I could be like hey want to come
over I can't do that in college and I
don't know this video is kind of like a
personal like emotional right or
whatever but I don't know it's just kind
of crazy and if you guys are seniors in
high school you guys know what I'm
thinking some of you guys might be like
can't wait to get the heck out of here
peace out everyone I hate everyone I'm
so glad to be done but I actually enjoy
my grade I enjoy my school I'm it's kind
of a sad thing being done I can tell you
I'm gonna be crying at graduation like
it's crazy so yeah um anything else new
in my life
prom is coming up I'm going with the
same guys at last year um so that's
gonna be very fun um
so I'm probably gonna be filming it get
like get ready with me video I'm gonna
do my own makeup myself and I actually
found someone on YouTube uh I forgot her
name but um she is awesome she has about
like 90-something thousand subscribers
so a lot of you guys probably follow her
or subscribe to her but I found out prom
makeup tutorial that she did so I'll
definitely be doing it so if you guys
think that I'm copying someone's makeup
tutorial like yeah I am that's why
people make makeup tutorials so people
can do them and like recreate them so I
will be doing that and I'll still make a
video on it and I will give all credit
to her because she's the one who did the
video yeah it's kind of hard to make a
video showing you guys what I've been
doing and what I've been up to and
please please please please
please send me video requests in the
bottom bar below I want to hear every
single video request if you want a room
tour closet tour prom makeup um like
celebrity and inspired tutorials
anything like that like please let me
know like how I do my hair videos even
though that video would be very boring
excited just tell you I shampoo and
condition I do a leave-in conditioner
and I'm done so but like any like hair
tutorials or anything like that like I'm
getting it died again during spring
break it looks really light right now
just because of the light hitting it but
it's not that light and
so I'm kind of getting it lighter so if
you guys want to get a video of that let
me know just please let me know any
single video requests cuz I have kind of
like a passion to start doing videos
again and it's like this feeling inside
of me that I want to film Phil Phil Phil
Phil so please let me know if you guys
want me to do like a cooking video I'm
the worst cook ever but maybe the guys
request me to do cooking videos I will
become better at it or something like
that like literally anything you want me
to do I want to hear it just because I
need ideas cuz I'm kind of blank out of
ideas so yeah just let me know I guess
