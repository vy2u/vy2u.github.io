exciting video and as you can tell from
the title I am in Seventeen magazine
crazy okay so I first I am going to just
to show you the issue I am in me Lily
Collins Lauren it's the March issue and
a lot of people were asking me if this
was me and I'm like no it's um Lily sits
right here Lily :
it doesn't really look like me but okay
I appreciate it she's gorgeous but and I
am on page 42 I have a full page for
myself it says like meet Natalie and
then it says my blog and it says my age
and then you hometown and I'm not gonna
read everything to you guys cuz yeah I'm
just not gonna like sit here and read a
magazine to you but um I mean just going
to explain to you like why I am in it
and how I don't know because a lot of
people were asking me like the process
and everything so I am a part of the 17
Style Council there's five of the trails
with me and it's really exciting because
it's kind of just random people like all
throughout the u.s. like not famous
people or anything you just apply and I
just want to let you guys know that this
has nothing to do with YouTube they do
not find me I applied many of you
probably applied because I know a ton of
people who applied I found out through
their Twitter that they were taking
application so it's like okay I'm gonna
apply and I just want to thank you guys
because not because I has anything to do
with YouTube but because if I didn't do
YouTube I would never have the
confidence to actually apply and even do
this like I don't know I just would
never have the confidence to do it um so
that's why I want to thank you guys and
I just wanted you know the application
process because a lot of people were
asking about that um so the application
process it was kind of like okay so
September they had applications and
they're like everyone apply so I applied
the thing was like your name your age
you're where you live basic stuff like
your birthday and then it was like
describe a personal style describe what
you were in the first day of school in
or I describe like all this stuff you
know I don't know if the application is
the same whatever year but that is how
was this year and then it also asked if
I had a blog and I said yes you know cuz
I do and all that stuff so I think this
economy it's have a blog in order to do
this just because every single other
girl in here has a blog so I'm guessing
that they wanted people with laws that
would give you a major advantage but um
so that was how in that application
process right and then after I sent that
in a few weeks later at first my friends
were like did you make it and I'm like
well I mean I don't know like I just
send it in and then like after two weeks
I was like okay I didn't make it you
know I think if they email me back right
now
and then like a week later or something
like that I don't even know how much
long later I got an email and I was like
oh my gosh like they're considering me
because it wasn't like a full thing it
was just like a consideration thing like
hey Dad Lee we're considering you send
in more pictures
so they were considering me I'm dead
after a few weeks later I got the email
I actually got in and if you were me I'm
sure that you'd be bouncing off the
walls too I was ecstatic I was like over
my head like holy cow so that was an
application process right and I just
want to let you guys know that this has
nothing to do with YouTube I know I've
said this before but really it doesn't
because a lot of people we're also
saying like please don't change like
just now that you're in 17 you're all
big and like no I'm not like I mean I
think it's a huge accomplishment and I'm
so proud that I have in this magazine
then it's not like I'm like I don't know
how to explain it but it's not like I'm
gonna change like even if I even if they
did ask me to be in the magazine I still
wouldn't change was like I don't know
it's different when they ask you they
like you would you like to be in her
magazine but it's like I applied like I
did this on my own kind of you know what
I'm saying like it didn't really have
anything to do with YouTube at all and
none of the other
I don't think happy YouTube's I don't
know personally I don't know that
personally I've never met them before I
have it I don't think they have youtubes
but they might um I think one of them
might have one but I don't know but yes
so don't think I'm gonna change or
anything because I am still the same
person in for my first video to my last
video to my third video still the same
like don't worry about it um but yeah so
I am getting a ton of facebook like I
keep like checking my phone if I'm
looking now and getting a bunch of late
notifications but I'm getting like a ton
of like Facebook things like
congratulations I'm like all of this
stuff and it's just incredible like I
thought this magazine was coming out
February 7th so someone actually
twittered me and they were like I saw
you through the magazine like
congratulations and I'm like wait what
and I was at the mall let him like a
Barnes and I'm a Bullock down the street
remember so me and my mom were like okay
we're going to Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and we're
getting a magazine so like we have 15 of
them because I have family in Honduras
and they don't get this magazine so like
we're gonna send it to them and all this
like friends and family then they want
to see it also just to keep forever
because this is a major accomplishment
you know so we thought 15 of them and we
like I took the picture and I was like
you know like with it and then I put it
on Facebook and everyone was like oh my
gosh like congratulations
so like I'm getting it's a good response
at first I was really nervous about how
people would react to this like I wasn't
sure if they think it's weird like that
I'm into fashion or anything like people
know I'm into fashion definitely because
I mean they just know I am but um I
don't know I didn't think I'd know what
to think because I've never experienced
this and I've never had anyone
experience the side as close to so I
don't know it was just crazy and I just
this video it was such a ramble and I'm
just like well that like we're just
fooling around they don't even make
sense but I just want to thank you guys
cuz without YouTube I would not have the
confidence to do this and you guys
definitely made me come out of my
comfort zone and I'm just so happy and
uh yeah so make sure that you people
your magazine today and or soon and
and then I enjoyed this issue a lot I
have I've already read it like three
times but I like it because it's kind of
like step into spring so it's kind of
like different for all the other ones
recent run so obviously it's kind of
like the same one for less your spring I
mean with new trends but like it's Sara
because it's the first one that they're
introducing spring so that's good um and
I like the cover because it's a really
neat on its kind of different from
normal 17 magazines but I like it um and
also I had a question for you guys do
you guys want me to do tutorials on
what's in this Americans even kind of
like the beauty here it's runway 270 way
like ask the experts special like do you
guys want me to do one video that kind
of addresses all of these things like
one baby like one video that addresses
the graphic cat I kind of shown you how
to do that what were the same video that
sub kiss cheeks citrus eyes and then
fruit punch lips and I think that's it
right yeah
do you guys know what you do like a
video including that like kind of a
tutorial on I don't know how to explain
it but like one video that's like runway
the seventeen way tutorials and you know
like but just do one video so don't be
like four separate videos edit it
together but I don't know do tell me
gene X I was thinking of doing that like
a few months ago and then I was like
okay I'll do it and then it was like oh

want me do that now or I know so let me
know in the comments below if you guys
