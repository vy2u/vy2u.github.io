so long I did hot yoga and then I did
the stair stepper for 30 minutes so I'm
literally dead and they need to refuel
but I decide to do a intermittent
fasting video so it's gonna be blogs out
you guys like it so I'm at the gym right
now and I'm just gonna do some work and
eat my lunch so I don't start eating
until twelve so I only eat from 12 to 8
and I'll talk more about intermittent
fasting throughout this video I do still
have the same amount of calories I would
if I didn't do intermittent fasting I'm
just only eating from 12 to 8 so that's
the only difference so right now it's
actually 12:40 so I'm getting a later
start so this morning all I've had is
water I literally I work out on an empty
stomach so I always work out on an empty
stomach that's just like whether a
breakfast or not that's what I would do
and a lot of things I get breakfast just
I keep reading send dude but today I am
at my gym and it has like a cafe and I'm
also going to be working on my editing a
blog so
that's why I decided to get from lunch
because their lunch here I think it's
better than their breakfast and I was
just in the mood for something a little
more savory even though I really wanted
an acai bowl but I just like I can make
those at home so when I'm out I like
getting different things but yeah I've
just been drinking a ton of water
because I literally worked out for two
hours but so much like for it's just so
many calories so I need to stay hydrated
and now I'm just waiting on my food and
I got ham and cheese sandwich with
tomato bisque but everything here at
this gym Spa is super super healthy like
made it's really fresh ingredients so
I'll show you guys that once I get it
there tomato bisque it looks really
really good I love tomato bisque and a
ham and cheese sandwich after next time
I go grocery shopping though I'm gonna
try to go completely 100% dairy-free but
that has not started yet
so yeah it looks really good
it's time to open this box of chocolates
from Valentine's Day yay I'm so excited
so I'm a treat myself how beautiful it
just this look you guys yes I'm just
gonna have two chocolates and then I'll
probably eat my second like mini meal of
the day for my second meal ish of the
day I'm gonna make a smoothie so I'm
gonna make a protein smoothie I have
been just really really craving fruit
lately which I guess it's not a bad
thing but I really just want to have
like a really good fruit smoothie so
like I told you earlier I was craving an
acai bowl but I was like no I can make
that myself so I have a bag of frozen
fruit I just like freeze fruit that I
buy I don't buy frozen fruit and throw
that in there put some pb2 or peanut
butter true not whatever and almond milk
or coconut milk and salt coconut milk
and I'll see what else I have that I can
employ in this movie
oh my gosh the smoothies oh good it
looks bad like it's like brown and like
not a cute color but like it is so good
anything with peanut butter in it I'm
down form I am reheating this I made
this a few days ago and I just meal prep
attach ish so I made a lot of ground
beef this is only one portion of it and
then I have a ton left in the fridge
with some rice so this is ground beef
it's a lean ground beef with diced
tomatoes corn and it off said I put in
this pretty sure that's like basically
it it's like really really simple but
really good oh and I have red peppers
that's what it is I am just gonna heat
this up and have this for dinner and
Ally's cooking too so she's also making
ground beef but mine I just need to make
because it's gonna go bad if I don't
heat it up soon I'll probably also have
a little snack because this is not too
much food so I'll either have an extra
serving or I will go and have a snack
after dinner because it is only 5:45 so
I have until 8:00 to keep eating so
an avocado just to give it a little more
flavor of a Mexican flavor so young this
is really really good I had some salt
pepper wow this is fogging up my camera
this seemed yummy
whenever I'm craving a soda I just opted
for Lacroix Lacroix however you say it I
have no idea
comment down below Lacroix people say
it's Lacroix really I'll look it up but
I don't know how to pronounce this but
it's so good and it's literally the
exact same mr. yang spark or okay normal
water I'm pretty sure I've had looked
into like if sparkling water is bad for
you and it's not it's like literally the
same thing so makes me happy I am about
to eat this dried mango as my dessert I
guess you could say it's just a little
snack so it's literally just dried mango
there's nothing else included in it so I
love mango so freakin much so this is
definitely a dessert for me but I got
this from thrive market if you guys want
a discount on your next purchase but
thrive this isn't sponsored everyone
gets this code but I will link that down
below because then you get $30 and I
think I get their dollars so whatever it
is we'll link it down below whenever I'm
done with my day I just like drinking a
tea this is to calm my stomach so this
is the tea that I'm using it's with
ginger peach and herbal tea tastes
really really good I don't drink it
every night but I do try to whenever I
just want to like relax and unwind after
a day really really having getting into
tea a lot more lately
that's probably all I'm going to eat
today and I know that today I didn't eat
that much and I want to explain why the
reason why I didn't eat that much today
is because I ate so much yesterday that
I feel like I'm honestly still just like
recovering from yesterday I honestly
think I ate like four thousand calories
yesterday I'm not exaggerating and I
know every day is a new day but I do
like today was probably my day that I
ate the least I guess I would say so I
don't really want the comments to be
bombarded with like oh my gosh you
aren't eating
I am I eat like I eat enough I don't
really count my calories so I don't know
exactly how much I did but I did realize
that today I ate less
and I normally do so please don't
comment anything like that I'm not a
nutritionist so anything I say should be
taken with a grain of salt and
intermittent fasting I think is a great
I have been loving it but I know that
it's not for everyone especially if
you've had eating disorders or anything
like that I do not recommend it because
I just think that that's not something
that you should be focused on I guess if
you have had that but for me personally
it's been working and I really like it
talk to your doctor if you think that
you want to start or you don't know if
you should start because everyone is
different so I just want to encourage
you guys out to be healthy and do what
feels right it with you I am NOT saying
that this works for everyone again but
it works for me and I really really like
it basically the point of intermittent
fasting is so that what your body has
like 12 over 12 hours to digest your
food because we're constantly eating and
if you have a constant like small meals
throughout the day your body never has a
time to like relax I think that is your
digestive system is constantly like
working and I think I think so today's
don't quote me on it but I will have the
link to the article that I read but it's
just good for it's actually helps burn
body fat and grow muscles I also want to
close off this what I eat in a day
intermittent fasting video and the vlog
off here so really hope that you guys
enjoyed but before I close it off I did
have one question for you guys so if you
guys are vegan or have gone vegan I
would really like to know your thoughts
on it and if you guys like it how easy
it is to transition as a college student
or if you just like did it cold turkey
or did you gradually jump into it I
really would love to know so please give
me your thoughts in the comments below
because I really do want to try going
vegan for a little bit I can't promise
that I'll be begin for life but I would
love to try it out so if you guys have
any tips for me I would really like to
hear them and if I do go vegan I'll be
sure to do a video on it but I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video again
please research before you decide to
interm it and fast definitely I am
always encourage a healthy lifestyle I
do not encourage anyone to starve
themselves or to not eat or to skip
meals or anything like that so please
please please don't do that like that is
not a good way to lose weight it's not a
healthy way to lose weight you're gonna
feel worse about yourself it's so
important
think of food as fuel and you need it to
survive you need it to operate and you
honestly want to enjoy it too so don't
be too hard on yourself if you have like
a bad meal and you don't have to have
like healthy does not necessarily mean
not Kasey's so just want you guys to
learn that because today basically
everything I ate was pretty good for me
like it wasn't anything crazy bad so you
can definitely make healthy things that
taste really really really good you guys
want me to do a cooking video be sure to
let me know because I really want to do
that next time I'm home because I have
like a nice kitchen and yeah I really
hope that you guys enjoyed this vlog I
say that so many times but comment down
below if you're vegan if you've been
vegan what your thoughts are any
supplements that I would need if I went
vegan that I would not be getting from
like meat or dairy but yeah alright so I
will talk to you guys later really hope
you enjoyed and see you guys on Tuesday
