I am filming a very random sit-down
talking video before I go into it I
wanted to let you guys know that I lost
my voice so this is why I sound like
this I don't normally sound like this
raspy and low but I lost my voice last
weekend and it's still gone so yeah it
just kind of rolling with it I have not
uploaded on Black Friday or the last
Tuesday and if you guys don't know I
upload every Tuesday and Friday so I
really hate not uploading when I said
I'm gonna upload that was the whole
point of me having a schedule was so
that I don't forget and I don't push it
off but this week was a really really
rough week and that is why I'm making
this video I'm human I have bad weeks I
sometimes just have a really awful days
and will sit in my room and cry all day
long which is basically what I did for
some of this week it was just really bad
and I don't want it to go I don't want
to talk about what made it bad but I
wanted to kind of read my old journal I
got this I think junior year of high
school and I'm a junior in college well
I like didn't even think about that I
kind of want to show you guys that some
things are like the end of the world
they feel like the end of the world they
feel like you don't know who you are you
feel like you lost all your friends or
you lost the boy that you really liked
or he's not giving you any attention and
you're sad and that was basically my
life and basically still is cuz I'm a
normal girl so that is why I'm filming
this and I wanted to read some parts of
my journal this isn't gonna be like one
of those funny reaction videos it's
gonna be more of a deeper one where I'm
kind of telling you guys like it's okay
not to be okay we've all been there and
I want to let you guys know that even in
weeks like this like this is such a bad
week for me and it's honestly one of the
worst of my life and I'll probably say
that again in the next five years that
this week was the worst to my life and I
just want to let you guys know that like
it's okay like I don't know just it's
okay to have bad weeks everyone
and it's not a bad life it's just a bad
week but I basically only wrote in this
when I was having one of those bad weeks
because when I was happy and excited I
didn't really journal anything I wasn't
one of those people that journals a ton
I just kind of journaled when I was
really sad and feeling lonely so this
wasn't like a dear diary like everyday
thing yeah I just want to give you guys
some inspiration hopefully this video
helps at least one of you guys okay so
the very first on trip entry on tray I'm
thinking of food first entry in this
journal is from January 5th 2013 three
years ago it was a very good day I guess
I was having a great day when I got this
I said this is my first day in this
journal and I am so excited I wrote a
page in my other notebook on New Year's
Day about how unhappy I was and how mad
I was and five days later I'm the
happiest I've ever been I've never felt
so alive quickly January 9th 2013
four days later not even five I wrote so
far so for some reason I don't know why
today was just a bad day I was just
slightly annoyed at school in general
but then in school today I'm gonna make
up a name cuz I don't want anyone
watching this and getting mad at me but
in school today Paul was asking me for
an answer it's a some fake AP exam since
I was working with this smart girl in my
class
and I guess he thought I gave him the
wrong answer and was telling everyone
that I did but I know this shouldn't
bother me but for some reason it really
does he consistently thinks I'm out to
get him I was highly considering texting
him and saying hey I'm not out to get
you baby this is funny I don't know
maybe word it differently ha but I
stopped myself because one I'm never
gonna be the first ones a text Jim after
everything and most recently about this
thing that he told people that was
really really like messed up that he's
told people I don't wanna say but yeah I
will not approach him I've told him
countless um numbers of times I'm over
it and Joe
hate him and I forgive him but yet he
continues to spread rumors and thinks
I'm some bitch let me tell you it's one
of the hardest things I have ever done
being nice to him honestly I don't know
why or how I'm doing it but continue
wishing me luck if any of you guys feel
this way like just know that me and this
one guy like it was a very small thing
but it meant the world to me like I
thought that when this drama was going
on in my life that it was just like the
end of the world and it was the worst
thing and now I look back at it and I
like don't care at all and it's just
like funny that I was even in that
situation so if you guys are going
through anything like that like middle
school or high school like I promise you
it feels like the worst thing in the
world and you feel like texting him
first you're like him caring what he
what you think or spreading rumors and
stuff feels so awful and it is in that
moment it is I completely like I feel
that and I know how bad I felt because I
cried my eyes out I cried myself to
sleep almost every night junior year so
I know if the pain is real it's not fake
pain but I'm just letting you guys know
that it gets so much better like it's I
don't even think about that anymore and
when I see that person I me and him I
think I mean we're not like friends but
like we'll talk we'll say hey catch up
like it's it's so easy it's so weird how
you can just put things behind you and
like I don't know I just I'm telling you
guys that it does get better January
17th
so like eight days after that happened I
said wow so this week really sucked I've
been so emotional lately and I don't
know why first of all exams aren't
helping me at all but I don't think
that's it and I don't want to get in my
depressed mood again I thought I was
better but what if I'm not what if I
really am depressed you lose everyone
because it's my fault I always do
something wrong and it's always me and I
take full responsibility for it I don't
know what's wrong with me I want to talk
to someone about it but I don't know who
all then maybe but she's too tired she's
probably tired
being best friends with the depressed
girl oh my gosh okay this is bringing
back a lot of feels if you guys feel
this way you guys are not alone like I
was really junior year was a rough one
for me um I felt like I was losing all
my friends if you can't tell fed
sometimes I wonder if I met myself would
I like myself that scares me too and if
I look back to 2012 so much has changed
I've lost so many of my friends Paul
especially that guy that I was talking
to I don't know why that still hurts
because it shouldn't and I should be a
hundred percent over it by now but I
know I know he is and he's happy too
people are glad when I'm not in their
lives and I'm done with them they
realized they're better and I'm over the
break-up completely and so happy we did
it
but I'm just not over the thought of
losing a friend oh my goodness I thought
this thing was the end of the world that
was obsessed with some boy that was so
stupid like it was just like looking
back now it's stupid but in the moment
it was not it was just so I was so like
oops I don't know I don't know why I was
so into someone but like I was so young
and so naive and just really into a boy
and that happens you guys like I feel
like everyone goes through this no one
just kind of wants to admit it but I'm
here admitting that I was into someone
so much like Wayne when they were into
me and like I thought that it was
everything to me when it was actually
looking back not like he's so like it's
just it's not a big deal anymore so I
want this to kind of be like hope for
you guys like what you're going through
now will not be a big deal later on I
just kept asking myself why am I so sad
on the outside I look like I have it all
and if you think about materials yeah I
do
but I don't know what's missing
sometimes I would still kind of have
like inner conflicts with myself like
I'm not good enough for anyone I'm not
like people don't like me but all this
stuff and I still feel that way all the
time but like in this moment I like
really really felt that way
and it sucked guys so not gonna lie I
understand if you are doing like if
you're going through this
this college is so much better and even
in college I had some of the worst weeks
of my life like freshman year I had
something that I thought was the worst
day of my life and it was the day I
found out that my boyfriend was cheating
on me so that was pretty bad and then
saw or junior year this year I felt like
the worst week of my life and so far is
the worst week of my life but like I'm
sure I know that in like two years I
think we all have another one of those
you know like it's just it's kind of
discouraging so it's like wow will I
never take catch catch a break but it's
encouraging because these things are
insignificant in the future you're not
gonna dwell on them you're not gonna be
sad forever I've had one bad week out
compared to every other week being a
great even if it's not like oh my god
this was the funnest week like I was
happy genuinely happy so I just want you
guys to know that it does get better I
find one of the entries nately Barbu and
then in parentheses I said why did I
write my last name oh my god I'm weird
guys like I'm strained I'm in a strange
person
everywhere II 14 2013 Valentine's Day
parts yay
I'm not one of those people who
complains on this day and I'm not gonna
be nor will I start I'm so happy when I
see all these happy couples but it would
be nice to have another person who
wanted me other than my family and other
than God I know those are the greatest
things and I know they're enough but at
the same time I miss having someone to
talk to I miss having someone who cared
I never have had a feeling that feeling
before and I may have thought I had that
feeling but I really never have I can't
allow myself to think I'm not good
enough I know God is saving someone so
special for me and I know he is
protecting me but what if I want that
risk even if the guy will hurt me what
if it's worth knowing what it's like to
be cared about I want to be that I want
to matter to someone I want to be a
person that has someone I want to be the
first thought in someone's mind when
they wake up and last before bed I want
someone to be generally nice
care about me and I've never felt that
way never oh my goodness and then I said
and as much as Paul hurt me and as many
scars as he left me I did not regret it
and I learned from it and I made it out
was such a better person so if that
means that I get hurt again I want to
take that risk I want to know what it
feels like and maybe hope that there is
a decent teenage boy out there happy
Valentine's Day that boy that I'm
talking about so much is so
insignificant now like I I guess I
learned from that but like I learned so
much more in other parts of my life and
with other people in my life like I
don't consider that something that's
like scarred me anymore anything like
that I just think of it as like
something that happened in my life this
is kind of nerve-racking for me because
I know a lot of people from my high
school watch my videos like a ton I see
like on Google Analytics where people
are watching and it's like people from
my high school and so this is kind of
nervous for me because people know who
I'm talking about because I'm not the
type of person that has dated a lot of
guys and this guy that I'm talking about
I've never even dated it was like a
thing but I never dated him and so I
feel like people know who it is and
that's kind of like scary for me so this
is in May so all of this stuff that I
was reading earlier happened in like
January February so now we're in May and
I said AP exams are next week oMG it's
studying my butt off for AP psych since
miss mrs. s didn't teach us anything
okay
so idk if I wrote this but Jonathan
asked me to prom and I'm glad because me
and Jonathan are good friends honestly
he's probably my best guy friend and the
thing is I'm pretty sure that he likes
me like as a friend nothing more I was
so excited for prom though and super
excited for summer should be awesome
so is he at this point like at the end
of that same school year I wasn't even
thinking about that situation anymore
like that situation was long gone like
it was over one of them I said
so I'm just writing cuz I'm filming my
back-to-school outfits video
YouTube I guess this like was a
potential to be an intro but like it
ended up not being it cuz look at how
crappy that looks I wrote down I highly
encourage all you girls to do this wrote
down a list of qualities that I want my
future like boyfriend husband husband
boyfriend to have um one of them was I
want a guy who is spontaneous and
adventurous yet will stay just and yet
he will stay just to spend a lazy
afternoon with me sometimes I want a guy
who isn't afraid to let people know that
I'm his I want a guy who respects me and
my family I said I want a guy who will
play soccer with Lucas and enjoy it and
I like soccer players the one a guy was
not clingy and who realizes I need my
alone time but never wants to be lonely
I want a guy who I won't have to be
afraid when they talk to other girls cuz
I'm a jealous person and I want someone
who was tall handsome and strong I want
a guy who will make me a playlist and
know exactly what songs to put still
very important to this day good music
taste is hot I want a guy who won't be
too embarrassed if I offer to pay to
help out yeah strong women but then I
was that I want a guy who will still
spend some money on me but only if he
can't I want a guy who will forgive me
willingly because God knows I'll need to
be forgiven I want a guy who likes my
friends and who has nice friends not
jerks is that too much to ask at the
bottom I also wrote the lyrics to Miley
Cyrus's wrecking ball because I feel
like really touch tree started writing
about my prom date in here by the way he
ended up being my boyfriend my very
first boyfriend so that's why I thought
it was funny that I was like I think he
likes me but like I don't like him I
said it was like so me and whatever his
name was prom date whatever I said
Jonathan I think
so me and Jonathan are officially dating
I was ranting about this one girl that
was talking to my boyfriend like people
who watch this from my high school are
gonna know so many names and so many
things it's gonna be so embarrassing and
I hope no one texts me and they're like
hey like why'd you talk about me and
that like I actually wrote about you my
journal this is so much more
embarrassing than me talking about you
in a video but this was a long time ago
like I'm very like putting myself out
here right now my channel I do what I
want so tell you to talk about so
December 2014 freshman year of college
after final exams so I said so it's been
a while I've successfully cleated
completed my first semester of college
with a 3 point 3 3 GPA not bad but not
great let me tell you about my first
semester I and last summer Wow a lot has
gone on Jonathan and I were planning to
end things before college which we did
but shortly got back together because
we're only 30 minutes away we broke up
though beginning of November for a
weekend because I had discovered that he
was cheating on me go to my cheating
video if you kind of want to hear about
that um I hope if you're reading this
you never have to go through that pain
your heart shatters in a million pieces
and you feel like you can't sleep I
honestly think it feels like death do
you know what it feels like to be
completely used and lied to for so long
question and doubt everything that
person has ever told you pill searching
for the scattered pieces of my heart
Natalie you found them it's okay you
found them you picked the pieces up I
keep wondering how the hell did things
get so complicated literally what I'm
thinking this week - how the hell does
my life get so freakin complicated I
don't know then I wrote July 2015
long time no writing basically how every
journal entry starts and would take way
too long to write down everything I
missed but just now I'm happy oh this is
such a good ending to this but just know
that I am happy I didn't think I would
be but I am a month and a week ago
Jonathan and I broke up and it was
easily harder than I thought it was
surprisingly harder than I thought then
it was easier it was as mutual as
anything could be both realized our
differences were too big to ignore and
we had ignored them for a year and a
half and we couldn't do it anymore the
things change and God has a plan and
it's good if we let it unravel to be a
light in this very dark world and I fail
and make mistakes every day but God is
good and I'm sorry for messing up a
daily love Natalie and I was the last
thing I wrote so it was kind of a good
ending um seeing the light at the end of
the tunnel that's kind of what this week
is this week was so so so so so so so so
so rough but there is I know that there
will be better days and it's already
looking up so if any of you guys related
