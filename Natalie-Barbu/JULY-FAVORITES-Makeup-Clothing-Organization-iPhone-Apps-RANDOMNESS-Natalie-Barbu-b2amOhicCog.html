will put that up for you let me know
what videos you guys want me to see any
blogs anything else back-to-school
videos are going to be coming up so let
me know does I'm gonna do a lot of
advice videos because I think they'll
seem to get the best like feedback I
guess so yeah I have college videos that
I can link down below its guys wanna
check those out but I'm gonna be doing
some high school ones and i think i'm
gonna try to get Chloe to help me out
with some middle school ones so I'm
really excited about that but anyways
let's hope it to this video because this
is a July favorite so I just I'm gonna
get back into the swing of things for
favorites videos they have not done them
in so long I didn't last month but
before that I had been instead on and
show long so I'm gonna start doing them
I'm think I'm doing more of a twist
who's normally I'm focused just on
makeup today I have to make of items and
the rest are totally random so I'm
really
about that just because I feel like in
the summer I really don't want to make
up that much in the summer so I'm just
basically showing you guys my essentials
and yeah let's just get started with
this video make up what I had are only
two products like i said but they are
the best products ever i'm going to be
wearing them all throughout the whole
year like I think these will be in my
favorites videos for a long time the
very first product that i have is this
blue mascara from benefit my benefit
just released their like line of
colorful things and basically all i got
with the blue mascara i love it so much
so good guys this is what it looks like
it's so vibrant and it's so blue and
it's just really really pretty on your
eyelashes and it kind of makes you look
like you have blue eyeliner on but it's
a nice twist cause it's mascara and also
um I I have brown eyes to get sceptile
and literally nothing makes brown eyes
stand out but I found that this actually
really does make brown eyes stand out so
I am obsessed with it i have used it in
a previous video before but it's
definitely my july favorites I'm not
wearing it today unfortunately but I've
literally been wearing it probably five
out of the seven days a week every
single week of the month of july since i
bought it so yeah definitely this has to
be one of my favorites because i love it
so much next time your item of mine is
the naked smoky palette i believe i got
these around the same time this is
definitely my favorite smoky palette or
my favorite naked palette eyes come out
I think I like the first and this one
the best so first and last so far I hope
they keep making them because they're
seriously awesome I don't know what
other colors that could include this one
is perfect because it has the Browns and
then it adds the blues and then is the
purple then it also has some shimmery
colors and some matte colors which most
of them did not have matte colors unless
you had the basics palette which I did
not have spaces how it but yeah I have
basically been using these two colors
every group I've just been using these
two colors every single day of the week
please agree thanks radar and aroma
they're so pretty you guys like that's
what I'm wearing right now on my lid and
I am obsessed with it I think it's just
really
pretty with a brown and grey shimmery
colors click on from makeup I have a
couple of flowing products that i love
so basically my favorite clothing
products have been wearing crop tops and
matching shorts so these two are from
she inside I love them so much I will
have the link down below for you guys to
check them out but i got these shorts
which are blue and the kind of like acid
wash blue with some white underneath and
then i got the matching tank top to go
with it it's kind of like a halter
really really kind of revealing i guess
but i think it's really cute this is
what it looks like and then you just tie
it so it's really like small but i
really like it you just kind of where a
backless bra with it and i think it's so
cute so yeah i've been loving the
mashing like sex and then the tassels at
the bottom I think they're so cute and
then I also have the white version it's
a little bit different this was a little
more dressy like the material is more of
a kind of silkier material so there's
these white shorts with kind of a
crochet at the bottom and then there are
this chop which again it all it is is a
tie but it's a little more like it's
very different I think it's so so cute
I've been wearing a lot of backless bras
with some art if you guys can't help ya
just kind of a matching shorts and tank
top combo has definitely my favorite for
the summer and I think that that trend
will kind of stick around for the
following years I hope I actually really
really like it okay my little sister has
a side behind the camera let me get let
me just
you're done okay driving older sister
probs now my favorite for organization
so I organization is a good category I
have been trying to get so much more
organized because I'm look really busy
and so I really want to get organized
and so I've been trying to looking up a
bunch of things to help me get organized
i know this pin is that strange but i
don't have to share with you guys tips
that I have found to be organized my
favorite thing so far that i got this
month is this notebook it's called or
it's called it's a notebook and it has
the word big ideas on it and it's gold
white and gold are my two favorite
colors basically so this was perfect and
I think it was really really cute and I
like it because here i have like all my
favorites listed out I've basically been
doing a lot of YouTube brainstorming
here me and my friend Katie actually
have a project coming up that I just so
excited to share with you guys I don't
want to share it yet but that will be
coming up so I'm really excited about
that yeah so I decided that in here and
doesn't like the pages have a boss
instead of lines and I think that's
really good because instead of the harsh
wine I kind of can get away with doing a
like doodling or writing extra bag or
something like the lines I feel like
just come find me I don't know I really
like it so this has been my favorite
notebook I've been really getting
organized just with brainstorming things
so this is mainly just for jotting down
notes like what am I gonna do my next
video and we can talk about some
connection points start with that and
then I also got this planner I think
it's really cute it's also from target
it has 2015 2016 on it I actually
recently I do like this planner for my
for july it was awesome but i don't
think it will make it to my August
favorites but for july was awesome
because i really needed something so it
just has your regular life calendar and
then it also has your week by week so
I'm just been planning
I've been doing week by week but I
recent ordered an erin condren I think
the same site planner so I'm excited
about that so I think that will make it
tight August favorites but for the month
of July this one worked awesome and yeah
I really liked it and I also had an act
to help me stay organized so this is
what the app is cold so it is called to
do it's like the number two and then do
get it and basically it is just a to-do
list on your phone self-explanatory I
could do it in a notebook but i like it
because it gives me notifications and i
can just check it off once i do
everything i need to it's really good
because you can do category so i have
one for home work school and youtube and
like you can play days and times and
everything like that so i really like
this ass it really does help me stay
organized next category is my favorite
iphone apps or just things that i like
to do on my iPhone because if you don't
know I basically live on the my iphone I
love it so much um like a lot of 19 year
old girls I do a lot on my phone so my
favorite apps are of course I always
feel like I shouldn't include this
because like like it's kind of
self-explanatory but definitely
Instagram is my favorite app so far I
love scrolling on Instagram I just love
looking at things i like seeing who
follows me so see his follow me I
definitely looks look eckert feed if you
guys are not private but yeah I just
basically sometimes like okay let me
know if any of you guys do this you get
creeped on yourselves like I'll go on my
own Instagram and like creep on myself
and like look at it and like sue
commented it or see like when I posted
it or like literally all look back to
like years ago and be like oh I remember
that like does any less capable zones I
don't know if it's only me but yeah you
can follow me if you want its Natalie
underscore Barbu I post a lot on their
kind of fashion inspired mainly but also
just my daily life if you guys kind of
want to see what up to Instagram is my
most used social network then I'm also
snapchat
became public with my snapchats you guys
can follow me on that too if you guys
want to it's also Natalie underscore bar
bail but I've just as loving these
little discover things on snapchat I
think that they're so fun to look
through when I'm bored I don't know am I
the only one that use this time I feel
like I'm the only one that looks sturdy
then at my next favorite app this is
gonna be kind of um I really like this
app I think it's a great idea so I've
been recently trying to journal more I
have an actual journal that I journal at
home with but kind of on let's go I
wanted to journal and so I downloaded
this app and it's called my w days I
have the light one just because I didn't
want to pay money for it i think if you
pay money in journal more than ten times
a month but i haven't journal more than
ten times a month so that's why i
haven't bought it yet but if I do decide
i need to buy other nice Stefan will
because I'd really like to ask so you
open it up and you can set if you a
passcode or not I do just because I
don't know this is where I write like
all my thoughts so I kind of don't want
people crazy on it in case anyone does
have my phone so I have a passcode to it
that's just me um but yet you don't have
to have a passcode if you don't want to
but I do it just cuz you know and then
you can like write your journal I don't
want to like to show you guys I'll show
you guys like a moth one so today and
then like you can show write it and can
also write like see your mood like if
you're like super happy you can put it
all the way up and if you're super sad
you can like to sit like that I don't
really taste that seriously I kind of
just like jotting down things so yeah
that's why I have asked and then my last
favorite iphone app is called brief me
and it's actually a news app I've
recently been trying to get more I
realize when I'm at college I tend not
to focus on the news as much because
when I'm at home my parents talked to me
a lot about it my parents are very into
watching the news they're into politics
a lot of like they know what's going on
in the world which I think everyone
should I think that's so important to
know what's going on around us so I have
wanted to become more independent on how
like me looking at the news myself
instead of just
bring it from my parents because I
realized when I was at college I didn't
really know what was going on and then I
came home my mom was like oh did you
hear about this it was like oh no and it
was some like huge news story so that
made me really embarrassed so I decided
to download an app and I think it's so
easy we're always on our phones you
might as well download some app that
will educate us because I think that's
really important um I download this app
club brief me and I know a lot of apps
are either ultra liberal or ultra
conservative or somewhere in the middle
I don't know but like this app sighs all
the news stories amen one so it shows
you just to top the top stories
basically and it pulls it from all
different types of websites it's all the
different news sites so it's not just
one and I think that's kind of good to
have all of them to know and then also
you can also do sections and then they
have a tall text world business sports
technology and entertainment and you can
see like the top waters in those
categories then you can do streaming and
it just tells you literally what is
streaming the next like what article is
posted five seconds ago from like all
over some of them are like local news
things so I think that's kind of cool to
UM again I really like that up it's
really easy to use and it kind of keeps
me informed what's going on I check it
every single day and they give me
notifications whenever new things trend
so yeah I definitely recommend getting
that app if you guys want to stay
informed on the world basically and then
for my favorite music movies and TV
shows so my favorite music has been be
Hillsong album if you guys don't follow
Hillsong Baker Christian man Christian
like pop rock band I guess they're
really good though because I normally
cannot get into that big of like
Christian music like I love fishing
music but I think some of the older ones
i don't really like it
much and I feel like some of the radio
stations kind of all sound the same not
all of them but just some of them and
but Hillsong I love I think they're
awesome they're so talented and their
songs are really good so if you want to
listen to empires I will have that
linked down below I can link my Spotify
or something but yeah I've really been
liking that whole album it's been great
and I think it's really up listing and
also it could help me I was going
through kind of something hard at the
past month so I just listened to that
one rupee and I think it really really
helped me a lot just kind of being
surrounded by Christian music I don't
know it and also for my favorite movie I
just saw train wreck last week and I
thought it was hilarious it was a really
long and normally movies I'm like when
is it gonna end I'm just born this one I
was not bored at all there was over two
hours long it was a long movie and I
thought it was so funny I just I really
like Amy Schumer I think she's hilarious
so yeah that maybe definitely hit thumbs
up go see it like my thought was
hilarious my favorite TV show I finished
parks and rec and I was really really
sad about that cuz that's my favorite TV
show pork smirk and Grey's Anatomy or my
favorites but recently I've kind of been
catching back up to the office I won't
like season four and left off really
like the office but if you guys have any
other TV shows cuz I'm kind of getting
tired of it but because of any other TV
shows that you recommend watching please
leave it down below I probably already
seen it but just in case I haven't leave
it down below um and yet those are all
the favorites for the month so let me
know if you like these kind of different
favorite videos like not just make up
because I think I have a lot more to say
other than just make up but yeah I'm so
excited to let you guys know about the
project coming up with me and my friend
