it is july like 9th right now but i'm
just going to do a favorites video plus
i want to and i have me i don't remember
the last time i did say right to video
and i don't have that many but i really
wanted to film and then do a giveaway at
the end so this video is actually a
giveaway so stay tuned to the end to see
what I'm giving away to you guys I'm
really excited for this one and it is
mine give away because I reached 20,000
subscribers I'm almost 23,000 right now
which is crazy i hit 20,000 last week
and now i'm almost at 23,000 and yeah
just make sure you're subscribed if you
want to enter and also just like cuz you
know part of our little growing family I
guess but I'm just gonna jump right in
give away and i'm going to start off
with makeup products I personally don't
have that many favorites this one's just
because it's summer and I don't wear
that much makeup in the summer except
today I'm kind of wearing a bold look
right now but yeah that's beside point
but my favorite foundation for the
summer is L'Oreal youth code family or
BB cream I love to this last year it was
like my favorite and two years ago I
literally repurchases every single year
and sometimes we're in the winter if I
don't have acne but it's perfect for the
summer and I have
at the net so you know this one's always
really good and you guys just really
like go and invest in it actually it's
like eight dollars it's not even a lot
of money and it's awesome my next makeup
product it's actually not a browse so
well my makeup product is about my
eyebrows today ms for my eyebrows it is
this anastacio growl hiss and I got it
when I actually got my eyebrows done and
Nastasia and basically it does not come
with these scissors but i actually just
like them in there cuz i like a trimming
my eyebrows they say get it looks long
but yeah it comes with be it um well
fully and then a brush for it and then
it comes with clear brow gel and it is a
bigger version of the clear brow gel
that exactly in my bathroom right now
comes with some tweezers that I drop so
they're pretty dull and then a bunch of
stencil so you can actually see your
eyebrow shape and cut out and do it
yourself which is really cool and then
it also comes with the eyebrow powder
I've just been really into my eyebrows
likely and trying to keep up with them
right now they might not be the best but
you know I've been trying ends at my
house so the next make it product is
also another eyebrow product this is
from NYX it is had one end of like this
highlighting thing which is awesome I
just put it underneath my brow bone and
it really highlight it and then it have
an eyebrow pencil so sometimes if I
don't have my brow powder I will just
take dick for traveling purposes I took
both when I think Florida but if I'm
just sending the night somewhere I will
just take this um but yeah it's really
awesome and this is basically the exact
same things that benefit has it's like
their brow Wow or systems like that but
it's like 20 times cheaper and it
actually comes with an eyebrow pencil
too so I highly recommend it
my ex a paper making products have to do
with the eyes and my first one is this
marc jacobs and i think they can i
pencil twinkle pop I sticks so I just
not know Marc Jacobs head makeup but
last summer i actually purchased this so
it's been with me for a while I can't
believe that was last summer thinking
about it now I'm like wow that's not
seem like last memory anyways this is
what it looks like it's just a really
pretty shimmery brown color I always
just sweep it over the lid it's such an
easy I make up look I have it on right
now and yeah I just sweep it blend it in
a little bit and then call it a day
everybody mascara I've been absolutely
love being at this mascara it's me
Georgey our mantra of never do much
lancome definitions mascara it is so
amazing i had pretty long in voluminous
lashes but they're not curls and if
altered Arctic's i'm a brunette but
these really likes in that they really
have met them and they like hold the
curl and it just make my eyelashes look
great wow I'm so not used to doing
favorites videos that this feels really
weird doing my next favorite is actually
a lip product at Angwin right now I have
been absolutely loving just purple lip
stick thing it's revlon colorburst matte
balm its skin the color shameless and it
is like the bomb mom and I'm actually
giving it away for you guys so yes they
can hit the end boise complete to give
away but yeah I really love purple and I
like how this is a to depot a purple
it's kind of like a white-ish purple for
the summer so yeah I my next favorite
has nothing to do makeup it is of my
favorite sunglasses I actually got this
with the store that i work at but it is
just the key sunglasses i style it
sounds like but it looks like they're
presque way but i think you pronounce it
keys so this is what they look like and
you can see that you guys are not on a
tripod goes on a chair
now i'm sitting on the floor but yeah i
really really love the mirrored
sunglasses and i took a lot of pictures
of these on my instagram if you guys
want to follow me um but yeah these are
like the cutest thing ever my next
favorite item is actually a muscle T so
this is 19 I just use this to work out
it but I am loving these to wear to work
at it whatever I think it's show cubics
muscle tees are just like tank tops like
15 tops that have like the huge like
armhole so you can kind of see like your
sports bra or something like that yeah
I've been look upset with this one and I
wear it every time we work out I need to
get more of that because this will
probably sells really pack my next
favorite item is not necessarily
distance if aquinas but just backless
thanks i just got this robbery yesterday
and it is so cute it's from nordstrom
but look at it it's totally exactly and
i'm obsessed with them that is a ver my
June favorites is something I wanted
July favorites or liquid in July notes
the middle of July but yeah that was it
for my June favorites and now on to the
giveaway I am so so so excited for this
giveaway oh my gosh so before you ask
any questions about the rules or about
any questions please look down below in
the details box because so many of you
guys ask questions like is this
international how mom when's the
deadline blah blah just look down below
but that would make your life so much
easier if because I don't I mean I will
still respond but like that would just
make everyone's lives easier if you just
read the details box before asking
questions and if my if your question has
not been answered and obviously pop down
below and I will answer it
everyone in your comments but yeah so
the first thing I'm doing the way to you
guys this is a huge giveaway but I
actually think it's like some good is
summer scene and I kinda have to do it
like my interest and then also
uncustomary it for you guys and that's
like my favorite artists so first thing
I'm giving away is this brandy melville
dress and it's actually a t-shirt dress
and sort of look like and I realize that
brandy melville is a one-size-fits-all
and one size does not fit all let's be
real here like one size doesn't fit all
but I figured this would be the best
clothing item to get for you guys
because if you're too tall or too babers
in the game can't wear as a dress which
honestly like ninety-five percent of the
population cannot you can wear the
substance like an oversized t-shirt with
leggings or oh just an oversized t shirt
with shorts tuck it into something and
if you can't buy into it so you can sell
it you can give it damn it down to
someone I don't know what I just want to
be really nice if I gave you guys
because I have I think there's and every
single color from brandi belle
constantly keep a chinese you know if I
have this dress too and yeah we can just
match and I basically I literally have a
brandy melville t-shirt dress in every
color so yeah that's what I want to give
it to you guys because I love them so
much and i know that you can wear them
so many different ways I've where-
shorts like an oversized t-shirt and I
like tuck it into my shorts sometimes
but like you can totally wear I however
you want if it does not that you I'm so
sorry you guys I don't know what size
exactly are but I tried finding
something that might fit to the most
amount of people so I figured a one size
thing would be the best and then I got
this t-shirt dress instead of like a
normal dress since an actuary
t-shirt or a dress oh yeah if he doesn't
pay you again i'm so sorry and you can
always hand it down or sell it and like
money off of it you know i will not get
offended if you spell on the next is not
giving away is this symptom pink it's
called surf days hair and body mist oh
my gosh it's so good i bought the lotion
version of this for myself and yeah i
love it and it's awesome for the summer
because when you're at the beach and
you're feeling like so sweaty and gross
could looking real we all feel that all
the time even if you're not the beach
you know if you're like an amusement
park or something you just spray this on
yourself and like it's instant like
cooler and then it also smells good too
so it's kind of like a hair and body
perfume but also a mist so that game
like you actually feel like refreshed so
yeah i got this for you guys and i love
like pink sings like victoria secret
pink lotions and all this and the next
thing I thought you guys I actually got
this for free and I'm just going to give
it to you guys just because the eyes
don't have a pink here or you know you
guys want this and you know you might as
well just have it I don't know I'm gonna
give you guys this dog I think it's
really cute i actually have a black one
of these but yeah i'm just giving
business cuz it came with it for free
and i was like i might as well give it
to my viewers you know so this is just
an extra perk this is like thanks for

annexing that I got is this not your
mother's beach baby texturising sea salt
