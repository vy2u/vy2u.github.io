which is crazy because i haven't filmed
in like two months or something like
that like ridiculous it is the longest
I've gone without filming and i'm just
going to update you in a few things for
like three minutes so bear with me
before I feel my June favorites video
but um the reason I have in films is one
because I have been moving as you can
tell them in a new background I moved
houses so I am in a different house now
so this will be my new filming
background most likely unless I find
another place to film which I don't know
where I would but um yeah so this is my
new room and please don't ask me to do a
room tour because i'm not going to in
this room because i don't really like it
I mean it's just like a rental cuz we're
moving back to my old neighborhood it's
like a long story but um yeah this house
is just a rental so like it's just like
my bed in my dresser like I didn't put
any effort into the room so please don't
ask me to do a room tour because I know
a ton of people are gonna ask and I'm
just not going to do a room tour in this
room so I'm sorry but um yeah and also
so I've been moving and then it was exam
week at school and then June I was just
totally going like I was in Florida with
my friends and then I don't know what I
did that two weeks it was just home
alone bored oh yeah my charger for my
camera I lost my charger for my camera
and so I couldn't film and then just
like a ton of things and then like I
went to New York for 17 again um I came
back a week ago and then it was just
been crazy but now I finally found my
charger and like everything's good now
so hopefully I will be filming videos
regularly now but I'm sorry if you're
not filming for the past like two months
or something because I've just been like
m.i.a lately but understand I had a lot
of stress going on and I had a lot of
stress on me and a lot of stuff going on
so it was like moving exam leaked a
bunch of vacations which is like
obviously not stressful but like can't
make me feel videos then I lost my
charger like everything that just like
went wrong went wrong so um yeah that's
why I haven't filmed lately and as you
can tell I'm Justin bumming it today
like hair in a ponytail like not even
like I don't even have like barely any
makeup on so um yeah bear with this also
but I'm just going to get started in my
June favorites because I haven't done
my favorites either but like my may and
april were kind of like the same thing
so you didn't miss much but my June
favorites I do have a couple of these
things that I would like to share with
you guys and hopefully I'll get into the
tutorials in the fashion videos
hopefully those will be like my next
videos I'll definitely do a fashion
video like probably the next one I do is
will be a fashion video so yay but um
yeah so I'm just going to show you guys
what my June favorites are and thank you
for coping with me after all of this
time of not filming or whatever but yeah
so my first favorite is a foundation and
I don't really wear foundation in the
summer so it's kind of like I only wear
it sometimes and my mom gave this to me
so it is quite pricey and it's very
expensive but like it's my moms like she
is not using it anymore so she gave it
to me so I didn't purchase this for
myself but um she passed it down to me
and is the giorgio armani silk creme
foundation I think luminous silk
foundation and it's like people say it's
full coverage and I like yeah this will
cover it but I literally use like a
little pea-sized like a dot and put it
all over my face so it's kind of like a
tinted moisturizer for me i guess like
because I put my shares right before I
don't know but I like barely use
anything so I feel like this is going to
last me like five years because like
it's still like really full and do you
like my fourth of July nails that I
messed up yeah happy fourth of July by
the way but um yeah it's like barely
four it's like barely empty and my mom
used it for quite a few months I've been
using it for a few days like a few weeks
because in the summer I don't really
wear foundation that much but um yeah
it's pretty good I would purchase it um
it is pricey though so it's a splurge so
if you don't have bad skin or you don't
have like acne prone skin and you don't
have like problems to your skin then I
mean I roop what it really spend all
that money on a foundation but if you
want a really great one because you have
problems with your skin then this is a
great one for you my next favorite is my
make up for ever HD concealer and this
has been shown in previous favorite
videos as well but it's just so good for
blemishes and for under eye circles and
I don't have that many blemishes in the
summer but i do get dark spots like sun
spots and if i want to cover it up one
day I'll doesn't doughton these this
concealer on them and then
they go away and like you can't tell
wearing makeup so this is like really
great my next is my hula benefit bronzer
I literally use this every single day
like even when I'm not wearing
foundation i will put on my bronzer just
because it makes me look a lot better I
got this last spring break on my
birthday it's like the birthday i was
turning 15 i got it so like one and a
half years ago i got this not one and a
half like a year and two months or
something year and three months ago and
i still haven't hit pan and I use it
every single day except in the winter
time so it's crazy it's not gonna last a
long time and it's like not super
expensive so this is like the best
bronzer that is like the best frann sir
that you could buy ever because it's
matt so it's like natural unless you
guys want a shimmery one which I don't
like shimmery browsers cuz they just
make me more oily cuz I'm like an oily
mess like seriously I use like 10 oil
wipes a day honey I don't really use 10
but I use like to my next is my mac
blush and I've said this in quite a few
favorites its margin this is what it
looks like it's kind of just like a
bronzy peachy blush I just really like
it and it gives me a nice flush on my
cheeks especially for summer because I
don't really want to look like I'm
wearing makeup so this kind of just
gives me like a bronze glow i guess and
i really like it my next are two
mascaras one of them is this mega plush
but thunder maybelline mega plush volume
Express waterproof mascara and I have
this waterproof phone but I totally want
to get the regular or maybe I'll just
stick with the waterproof but this is
perfect when I go to the pool I'm
wearing it today even though I'm like
barely wearing any makeup on today but
I'm in a week seriously why did I decide
to film a video today like look at my
hair okay but um it's like perfect when
you go to the pool because it is
waterproof and it just makes your
eyelashes look amazing and it looks like
it's about to tornado outside
my next mascara is this Lancome Hypnose
doll lashes it's seriously like the most
natural looking but so it's such like
it's like I don't know how to describe
it but like the wand is really cool so
they get the little baby hairs or babe
oh and the basketball hoop just fell on
my car outside that's great but yeah
this is the wand and it's just the best
mascara ever and I'm wearing these two
today and as a duo yeah they're great
but alone these two are like magnificent
and this is obviously a lot more sense
at than this one but this is still worth
the money I think my next favorite is
this liquid liner urban decay I have
been using liquid liner a lot lately and
this is the same one from like God knows
when I got this I'm neva know but I
really like the brush because it's just
like a little like a little tiny thin
brush so it's really easy for like a
placate appliance applique ting it's
real easy for applying it on your um
upper lash line and it's great for
really thin lines i'm wearing it today
and you probably can't even tell because
i did it really really thin because i
just wanted a little bit but yeah I've
been obsessed with this and then it's
good because I don't need to wear
eyeshadow because I hate wearing eye
shadow in the summer I like hate wearing
makeup in the summers summer time I
literally like don't wear makeup my next
favorite is like my all-time favorite of
anything ever like in my life like it's
heaven on earth I think um it's Daisy by
marc jacobs perfume i have purchased
this perfume i had look so weird i have
her just this for you like five times
already and then I stopped and I was
like trying out other ones and i always
come back to this baby because i
seriously think i get like a natural
high from it when I smell it like it
just smells so good it's the greatest
set ever and it also helps how it's like
the cutest packaging but honestly this
wasn't like a paper bag I would still
pay like 50 bucks for it because it is
just the greatest smelling thing ever
and
everyone always tells me when I wear it
how good I smell and like I feel like oh
you smell good is like the greatest
compliment you can get you smell good
your skin's nice and your hair is nice
greatest conference ever easily oh my
gosh I thought they I thought that
wasn't recording that would have been
really bad my next favorite is my last
favorite and it is my make up for ever
since eyes water / sensitive I cleanser
and it's good because for waterproof
things um I to get waterproof makeup off
I really like using this a lot and make
up for ever's a really good brand and I
don't know how much this is cuz my mom
purchased it for me but you just pump a
little bit I just literally take like
this much a little dollop and then I
like rub it between my fingers not gonna
do an accent I want to take out my
eyeliner or thing I'm mascara but late
and then I just like rub it on my eyes
and then it gets black all around my
eyes and it looks really funny and um if
you follow my friend on Instagram I did
it once and it was like so funny my
friends Instagram is at Ariana Claire I
think or Ariana Martinez I don't know if
you go to my Instagram and I have like a
million pictures of her and she's like
tagged in a bunch of them which comps on
all of them likes all of them like me
and her best friends but um yeah like
sorry I phone vibrating right now but
I'm talking so fast okay but that is
just like the greatest thing ever and I
liked it and then like when the black
coats all around your eyes I just take a
regular makeup remover and like wipe it
all off but like at least back off the
waterproof step off cuz again like I've
been saying i've been using this a lot
and it's waterproof and I've been go to
the pool and kind of wearing like
waterproof mascara all the time that one
because like at the pool I don't wear
any like face makeup but I do wear
waterproof mascara oh it's like really
scary outside but um yeah so that is it
for my June favorites and I hope that

worry i will be actually posting
