today I'm doing a very different video
for you guys so I really love filming
makeup tutorials so this is what this is
and from far away you may not be able to
tell but I actually have fake freckles
on and that is like the main thing of
this video I really wanted to look like
Kendall Jenner in a picture where she
has fake freckles I think they look so
natural she just looks beautiful she
looks so flawless but so natural like it
almost doesn't look like she was makeup
on but like she does I will insert the
picture right here so you guys can see
what I am recreating I absolutely love
it this look this definitely isn't an
everyday thing if you don't normally
have freckles because I did like dot
them on so you might not want to do that
every single day but for every now and
then I feel like it's a really cute and
maybe a little more unrealistic in the
winter time but I still think it's
really really pretty also if this is
your first time seeing me hello you guys
I am Natalie and I would love it if you
guys would subscribe I post videos every
Tuesdays and Fridays so happy to say and
I hope that you guys like this video I
really really love the way it turned out
and I really like the final look so yeah
I hope they guys like it and if you
don't follow me on Instagram and Twitter
and all that stuff please feel free to
do so subscribe and now let's get
started on the video so we are starting
off with priming my face with the Mario
Badescu rose water spray and then I am
going in with my strobe cream from Mac
so I'm actually just putting this on the
high points of my face and then I'm
going to blend it out with a Beauty
Blender I like putting this underneath
my foundation so it gives it kind of
like a glow from within if you guys know
what I'm talking about
and then I just blend it out with my
Beauty Blender after I do that I go in
with my Mac face and body foundation
this is a really light coverage but yet
buildable foundation so I absolutely
love it it doesn't leave you cakey at
all and it kind of gives you a flawless
finish like kendall Jenner and
especially with the strobe cream
underneath it just makes me look very
glowy and
natural which is the look that we're
going for now using my Kat Von D
concealer I'm going to just be dotting
any blemishes that I have and blending
them out with my Beauty Blender
after I do that I'm going in with my
Maybelline age rewind concealer and I'm
just putting it under my eyes and again
on the high points of my face this is
again to give it a bright look because
that is what I am trying to achieve if
you guys can't tell and then just
blending it out with my Beauty Blender
you'll see a pattern here everything is
blended with this Beauty Blender
since this look is a more dewy look I
just I'm applying a little bit of
translucent powder underneath my eyes
I'm not really baking it I'm just
applying just a tiny little bit and I'm
gonna let it sit there for a while then
I'm gonna pry my eyes in the meantime
but right after that I just brush it off
so it's like half baking I guess
Kendall does not really have too much of
a bronzed look but she definitely does
have some contouring so I am just
lightly contouring it might seem like a
lot because it's pretty dark but trust
me it's not when you blend it out it
just skin and gives it a really nice
glowy look and nothing too too heavy
which is what I like and now I'm going
in with my Mac mineralized skinfinish
this is in the soft and gentle color and
I'm just dusting it on my cheekbones at
this at first I'm just applying a little
bit and then I'm gonna go back in and
apply a little bit more because again
like I've said a million times this is
definitely a look that she is glowing
and then I am setting my bronzer with
another bronzing powder so you can use
any bronzing powder that you like I'm
just adding a little bit because again I
don't want it to look like I heavily
contoured it but I definitely want it to
look like I'm bronzed and then Kendall
actually had some blush on as far as I
can tell so I'm using my favorite NARS
orgasm blush and I am applying that to
the apples of my cheeks and just kind of
dusting it all over to give it more of a
rosy look even though this is a kendall
Jenner look I'm going to be applying
some the Kylie holiday kit so I'm
applying a matte purple color it's kind
of a very very light more of a neutral
color and this is the only eye shadow
we'll be using because if you guys can
see in the picture she only has one
eyeshadow on it looks like so I'm
applying it first on my lid and then I'm
just blending it out and applying more
in my crease with my blending brush so I
just want this look all over my lid
because that's definitely what she had
and it was like a purple color and she
doesn't have any heavy eye makeup so I'm
just applying brown eyeliner on my top
and bottom lash line
now I'm going in with mascara and you
can choose any mascara that you like it
really makes no difference I don't even
remember the mascara that I chose and
after I do my scare I'm actually gonna
be doing my eyebrows so I'm blending
them up because in the picture that's
what she has but I tried not to
emphasize my arch but like I just it
didn't work so I still have an arch in
mind but if you can try to minimize your
arch on your eyebrows cuz that will
really make it look like Kendall and as
you can tell I'm just brushing my brows
up and then I'm applying my freckles
which it's out of the frame right now
but it'll be in the frame like right now
and I'm applying my freckles with my Kat
Von D eyeliner I'm just lightly lightly
light only adding a tiny tiny dot you
can't even see these dots when you're
standing far away from me but since the
cameras show zoomed in that's why you
can see them and one of my eyeliners is
like totally messed up on the inner
corner and that's really really
bothering me and I wanted to refilm this
but I fixed it afterwards I promise I
just didn't really realize then I am
setting my freckles with the Laura
Mercier translucent powder this is just
so that they don't smudge because that
would be really awkward and then I'm
going over it with my bronzer and
highlighter again to kind of make it
look like it's underneath my makeup so
it's not as like dotted on as you can
tell because they definitely don't look
super real but I think that they look
cute for photos and far away they look
really really cute so I really liked it
and then Kendall doesn't really have
anything on her lips so I'm just
applying kind of a neutral lip gloss to
my lips and my lips are trapped so I
wanted something moisturizing then I'm
setting it with my rose water spray and
that's the final look so I hope that you
guys enjoyed this tutorial I really
loved filming it for you guys and if you
