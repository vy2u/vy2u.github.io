who do this but we will take like one
big location and we'll go there and you
know to spend Christmas with each other
and just like have a scenic view or
whatever yeah I'm just by so vacations

Tiffany Vivian asked what is one thing
that you regret the most and for me um I
don't really I hate this answers because
like everyone says it but I don't really
regret anything the most like there's
nothing I'm like oh my gosh I wish I
didn't I mean no I mean some of the
things are but I don't know it's like
everything is a learning lesson so in
the moment in in hindsight I'm like oh
my gosh I wish I didn't do that but then
I think okay if I didn't do that would I
be the person I am today or if I didn't
do that would that lesson like what I
need to learn that lesson another time
so I kind of try to think of it like
that so obviously there are things that
I regret doing like I'm not like oh yeah
I love that I did that but I mean
there's something they regret doing in
terms of just like how I treated people
or relationships or just little tiny
things like maybe I shouldn't have done
that or you know things like that but
then it's like would I be the person I
am today if I didn't make those mistakes
and what I've learned that valuable
lesson that I now learn you know so
that's why don't really regret anything
because I like Who I am today so
obviously you know nothing I did really
affected anything in such a grand way
for anything like help issue here yeah
I'm the person you are as for me I of
course in human and I'm not perfect
which I'm actually a huge perfectionist
so neither the little things I'm working
on but I do agree with natalie saying
that every encounter or like obstacle in
your life is part of your story and
it does she'll shelter view it shelfs
you it helps you because the person you
are and yes you learn from them and yes
you might have to learn the hard way but
the fact is that you learned you know
from all of it and yeah so life lessons
from that and grace yes specially series
each life lesson we like talking so
Shauna Leonard's suey I'm so sorry Shawn
as I say your last name wrong me and
Shauna are pretty close she had always
messages me and she's just such a like
she's one of my biggest supporters so
thank you shawn up for small shout out
to you um but she said what you do in my
guitar and how do you face tough
situations so what for me when life gets
hard and hard face tough situations I've
a very Sean faith in God so that is my
number one thing where I turn to um I
pray I ask God for guidance um no I
don't just pray when things get tough I
pray like route every day just like hey
God you know yeah good and bad but
Stephanie when life does get tough that
is definitely who I turned to a hundred
percent um I definitely it helps if you
want to faith in God honestly she try it
out like I know that sounds kind of like
you how do you just try that out but if
you are feeling alone for something just
pray like what's the worst that could
happen you know and I think you will
really find peace and also just guidance
so that's my advice I also i love that
she has a strong faith because i'm also
christian and it's good to have like
friends you know who can pick you up
yeah definitely having the environment
especially family too it's really
helpful for your face life is always
tough like there's not gonna be like it
easy I just mmm oh also change your
attitude in your perspective so that is
so important because if you have bad
attitude on something you're set on
something like negatively then yes it's
gonna affect the way you act and
everything so change your perspective
just try thee yeah super is hard but
it's worth it yes 19 Kamali 99 asked if
you knew be part of any TV show / series
which one would you choose and why um so
am I be part of any TV show or series um
