shopping mall go to the highest point in
all of Paris tionesta small right now
just focuses
right now here in Paris and it is called
galleria left yet this is crazy so it
has a lot of like expensive designer
brands so I'm kind of just browsing
because I can't really find like the
Affordable close but it's beautiful it's
like very very Parisian I guess is that
they say it and it looks like a palace
or something it's so so nice this so
cute this is like the fendi car I know
that's really cute like look at this
mall this is a shopping mall this is
insane you guys this is like heaven for
people that love designer clothes look

highest point in all of Paris we just
climbed up like 300 steps I'm tired and
we're the wrong shoes all been told me
not to a friend and in listen here's the
chapel for any of the chapel right oh my
gosh it's so pretty wow there's some man
at the bottom like basically just like
harassing people like spring from way
from like getting super in my face now
it's kind of like what intimidating
because it's my first experience in
Paris like a overall I felt very safe
and I still felt safe like so it's just
a little more intimidating i guess i
would say kind of why it's just like
you're never going to focus on my face
it's really really pretty dispute
besides me being so tired and just like
like being worn out pretty cool
Castle whatever this is and the view
italian restaurant was all then and it
seems very authentic i got gnocchi and
she got some bruschetta and yes keep
life good morning paris is the view our
middle hotel hotel very bright like a
lot bright very dark actually in this is
you hello it is the next thing and we
were supposed to go to London today but
our flight got canceled because of the
air strength going on here supposedly we
requested a refund and if I hope we get
it but like I read reviews on like this
like cheap airline that we bought it
from and they're like yeah like we were
pushed to read them and it gave it to us
like a lot of flights from these people
get cancelled so that's fun so in other
bad news all been lost her passport so
she's currently not here with me right
now bit of the u.s. embassy right now
she's like running there and hopefully
everything gets sorted out if you guys
have ever lost your passport overseas
calms down below your horrifying
experience because no I just feel kind
of bad for her I think in my I think she
got pickpocketed because she's like I
know I put it in my backpack but you put
it in like a side zipper where so easy
to like swype like I don't even need to
be like a good pickpocket ER and I
probably could have gotten it from her
so I don't know why people would want to
steal dashboards but I'm sure that
people have their reasons um so yeah
that's that's what happened please
ignore my like my makeup is like half on
my face after I make it remover wipes
like I washed my face twice and I
supposed to take off makeup but like I
was going on I look I look really rough

like no sleep i look rough i'm currently
packing my suitcase right now and i
actually got these jeans yesterday at
topshop i am obsessed with them they are
so so cute they're just like
high-waisted denim with like floral
patches online and i got these shoes how
cute are these shoes i love them and
love that they don't have a back there
like sandal loafers I think these are so
cool topshop and gear up

u.s. also got something regard and guys
whatever comes out we'd like your
leather looking jacket so sort of Slade

slice of English my suitcase is like a
struggle before i bought all these
things so I'm trying to like convince
everything but yeah I love it excited to

I'll does not make a path for it but
yeah that's what I got so I will update
you guys on the Alden situation and my
makeup is done you guys so just did my
makeup my hair is a little disheveled

shirt playing some music because I don't
have Wi-Fi or internet or anything and
yeah gonna make on another floor Paris
and myself I am currently walking to all
then in Paris I don't know what how to
feeling I'm probably pretty upset but
I'm walking in the streets and i saw
this really cool like graffiti thing I
think it's really really pretty just
normally don't think of Paris is having
like graffiti because here it is like in
the middle of the city I think it's
really really pretty kind of feel cool
walking by myself like it's broad
daylight and stuff so and I'm being
smart about it like my persons lift up
and everything like that but it's just
kind of like a one of those like side
street things mom if you're watching
this don't freak out I'm being very
cautious um but yeah I kind of like
exploring by myself my parents are
probably freaking out by me saying that
but it's looked at school and I'm just
meeting her for breakfast that's like
ten am though yes
that's what today it is hopefully all
them trucks feeling better so we are on
the subway right now or the metro I left
my camera actually I in the hotel so my
phone is what I have to work but pretty
good quality i feel like and i used to
vault on my phone all the time but all
benefactor the u.s. embassy and filled
them in on your passport yeah her
passport is lost we literally cannot
find it anywhere and just go tomorrow

going to need so she's like trying to
decide to go to like the US Embassy or
the US Consul in Marseilles and like go
to me from there I don't know we're just
trying to work out time with the sticks
and stuff but right now we aren't on me
stuff like to give me and despair yeah
so I'm super excited kind of like in the
middle of nowhere something out in here
we are disneyland paris a shower we are
waiting in line for the rockin roller
coaster whoo i'm so excited it's my
favorite guide and anywhere else so
everyone is getting their picture with
40 somewhere near Xena's lucky I am
impressed with how much this resembles
the one in Florida all them what about
you same you know it looks a lot like
and with the ride look almost identical
we just went on one finding nemo ride
that was different but my shot basically
uses that excuse me guys you're like
Claire appreciation
going on the side coward karen is like
Dorothy magic kingdom hearts
I'm
in line to go to it's a small world this
is such a cute ride so one of those like
slow ones though it's not like a
thriller and there's like white spot by
my corner it's is my screen is cracked
that's why but there it is behind me
looks a lot like the one in Florida so
I'm assuming it's just going to be like
the exact same ride but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
