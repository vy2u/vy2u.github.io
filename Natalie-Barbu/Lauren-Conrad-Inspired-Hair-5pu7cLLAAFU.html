hair tutorial I'll post the picture
right now and this is my interpretation
of it I know I don't look like her I
know this isn't exactly what she did
well I actually don't know that copying
her this is inspired by her I absolutely
love this look it's just a really pretty
look and it's just curled at the bottom
but I really like this I hope you guys
enjoyed this look and let me know what
you guys think of it and let's get
started first we're going to want to
have your hair parted to the side like
mine mine is just part to the side and
let your hair be very natural because
they're going straight and then after if
you have naturally straight hair then
you can skip this step but I obviously
don't so I'm going to be using a heat
protectant I use Kerastase this one my
mom so then you can use this on dry hair
let me sit I'm gonna see how it looks if
not I guess I'm just not going to do
this tutorial but this tutorial is up
then it worked fine I'm dry hair so and
it doesn't say you have to put it in on
wet hair so this is for dry to very dry
hair so I'm just gonna assume it means
this but I'm just using this because I
forgot my actual spray one and then my
straightening iron is this Chi digital
technology ceramics tree Nana what's
called is in this box here's what's
called and I'll be right back after I
straighten my hair because I'm if you
guys want a separate tutorial me
straighten my hair let me know but I'm
pretty sure everyone knows how to
straighten their hair so I'll be right
back I look so now I straighten my hair
it looks like this um it's just really
straight and then you are going to want
to if you already have straight hair you
didn't straighten it make sure you put a
heat protectant to the ends of your hair
right now oh and by the way that he
printed it is seriously the best you
could make them ever because it soon as
he leaves her hair like silk like I feel
like my hair is not hair it's actually
silk I like soon as you can't stop
touching it okay I need your honest step
but you're just going to use a wand
bliss curling iron clipless curling iron
and this is a Jose Eber Pro Series I got
to set a stand in my mall it's just a
cute little pink one and it's just a one
and then you are going to want to just
curl the very ends of your hair I will
show you that in my bathroom so let's go
on to my bathroom and I see how we are
in my bathroom and I am wearing as well
but so I like I said I have a curl or
clipless growing iron so that's I have
the gloves so that when I hold it I
wrapped around if I touch it
it doesn't burn me at all so this if you
have a wand list one or full-length clip
in one whatever clipless um you
definitely need a glove or else you will
burn your hand I have like I'm fake
blister right here birth Lister so I
just was touching enough notes at all
whatever I don't need the glove and I
burn myself the first time I didn't have
my glove so was it a big blister right
here so you definitely need your gloves
but anyways I'm going to take a curling
iron and you're just going to want to
curl the ends of your hair because in
the picture her head her whole head is
like Rose pretty much in just the ends
so you're just going to want to take
kind of a regular chunk of hair like um
a 1 inch maybe two inch nut a bit
smaller like like a one-inch like this
and kind of start from here and just
curl the ends and keep it there for
quite some time since you already
straight in bit so it may be a little
bit rough to curl just keep it thin
and now if you can see it's kind of like
a a regular curl and then you're going
to want to do that all throughout your
hair and just on the ends
the picture wasn't as tight obviously
her curls to kind of shake through but
not too much just gonna run your finger
isn't it you just jet I like twisting
like wet it but not too much obviously
cuz you still want to see the curl and
so it should look nicely curls like so I
love this look I really like it anyways
but then you're going to want to take
these these this front section of your
hair and just twist it
just keep twisting it like this and then
you're going to want to borrow a pin it
back right here and push your little
baby hairs out if you have any like me I
hate them but so now he taught me today
I am NOT going to hairspray my hair one
my hair grows pretty easily - I left my
hairspray back home not in Florida and
three I liked it better if it just kind
of falls and gives it a like natural way
because that's kind of how I see her
looking like Lauren Conrad really does
have naturally like not naturally maybe
here but it just looks a bit more less
did up you know done up did up I don't
even know less like curl that looks more
like a wave at the bottom of her hair
but I absolutely love this look I
seriously love it like just a little
company it is and then like like this
little thing right here it is just so
cute but anyways I really hope you guys
like this look let me know what you
think of it let me know if you like it
let me know if you don't like it let me
know if you guys have tried it up let me
and if you have tried it out so he's
