need to talk this video has been I have
been wanting to film this for a really
long time and it is about body
confidence and just kind of feeling good
about yourself and I just feel like I
have really needed to share some stuff
with you guys things been on my heart
and on my mind so grab a cookie grab
your coffee grab some tea sit down oh
wait let me just switches need to talk
so over the years months whatever my
life as a teenage girl basically from 13
to now 19 years old I'm almost done with
being a teenager which is crazy but I
have noticed that girls are really
insecure and that's not a shock to
anyone I don't think I know guys are
insecure too but girls especially are
actually men secure with the way they
look with the way that their bodies are
shaped with the way that they even act
like their personality like whatever
anything girls can be insecure about
everything and everything I think that
it is so important for me as I know I'm
not a huge youtuber and I am NOT a
anywhere on like a huge platform or
anything like that but I feel like I do
have a platform and I just want to get
this message across to everyone that
watches my videos including my friends
that watch my videos so because I know
my friends watch these so this is also
for my really really good friends too
and just for all girls out there though
I've been noticing how a lot of girls
really hate their bodies and bodies is
the number one thing I think kind of
like preteen years it used to be acne
and embraces and now it's bodies I don't
know if any of you guys can agree with
me but that is just how it seems to me
so a lot of you even really really hate
their bodies and body shaming is a huge
thing where we do it with ourselves and
I think have you guys ever been in a
room with a bunch of girls and you guys
all kind of one person's in the mirror
and they're like I hate my stomach and
then someone else goes in the mirror and
they're like oh you actually hate my
arms and everyone's kind of bashing
themselves yeah that is basically the
culture of today I live with three girls
and I've lived with them for
over a year almost two years now and we
do that a lot we actually kind of made
ourselves not do it because I think
we've realized how awful it was to sit
there and be like oh my gosh I hate my
body I hate the way I look and then all
of us would be like no no you look
gorgeous like you're beautiful whatever
but why can't we think that about
ourselves if we think that about other
people like I was no doubt in my mind
we'll go and tell my roommate like no
you are not fat I don't get that out of
your head you're crazy because and I
truly believe it but yet if she tells me
that I'm like let's know your line and
you're just saying that to make me feel
good but why can't we believe it about
ourselves it's kind of we have this
mentality in our brain where we just
don't believe and compliments that are
given to us and I think that that is
just our society as a whole has our
whole society is focused on self-image
everything has focused on self-image
it's we need to look good all the time
for the Instagram likes for snapchat
selfies like everything we just need to
look good and we think and we put so
much emphasis on social media and I
think no other generation and when I was
little like this was not when I was
little as in like 12 13 like social
media was not really a thing like it was
but it wasn't like it is today and so
it's just like blows my mind that girls
like my little sister's age who freshman
in high school they are 14 years old
they are like like worrying about their
bodies and worrying about how fat they
are or how like their arms look like
when when I was 14 I wasn't even
thinking about going to the gym and I'm
not saying that you shouldn't go to the
gym because I think that it's great to
be healthy it's starting from early on
but their body shaming already and
they're already like like developing
these bad negative thoughts about how
ugly they are and how they aren't good
enough basically or how they need to
look like that person that they follow
on Instagram and that is what breaks my
heart I think that this is anyone and we
can all agree with this like we follow
supermodels and we follow like Alexis
Wren and stuff like that really her body
is perfectly she's goals she's
everything College another topic that I
don't know I don't know if I can I'm not
gonna expand on it here because it's
like another video together but goals
needs to stop like we should just stop
saying that all together
please like I appreciate not like I like
no it's a compliment if someone comments
goals on something of mine but like I
don't want to be goals like please don't
comment down my stuff just because like
that's not I should not be someone's
goal like that's just that's crazy to me
the one thing I was thinking about um
before I filmed this was how can I get
it to people because I know a lot of
people will see this me like bow like
totally agree with you but in those
still like not believing in themselves
you know and I just want you guys to
believe it in yourself because the way I
think of it is what if you had a
daughter like let's say you have a
daughter you might have a daughter but
let's say you had a daughter would you
want her to start thinking these things
that you're thinking and not only when
you wanted to thank them
would you believe what she's thinking
like if she says something like mom like
I really need to not eat sugar today
because I just need to lose weight would
you tell her like no I love you you were
beautiful who are you trying to impress
like why is this your obsession and
there I'm gonna get into kind of like
Fitness after this but like there's
nothing wrong with like being fit but
like there is something wrong with it
it's an obsession and I see girls like I
see my friends who are so skinny or so
like in shape and they don't eat and I
music oh music I want to honestly just
shake them be like why are you not
eating like they don't advertise if they
don't eat but like you'll ask them to
eat something and I'm like no I'm not
hungry
why like yes it doesn't matter if you're
not hungry you need to eat like I don't
care if you're not hungry the fact that
you're eating 500 calories a day is not
good and like the fact that you're
starving yourself basically even if even
if you're not starving like your body's
gotten used to eating 500 calories a day
that's not good you were messing up your
metabolism you are completely like that
it's so unhealthy and just to think that
that's what you think is gonna make you
happy like do you guys really think do I
really think when I get like this do I
really think that eating less and
ruining my metabolism but yeah maybe I
get skinnier is going to make me happy
are we that shallow of a generation
where we think that skinniness is all
matters and that Instagram likes is all
that matters and that like because I
feel like half the reason why we do this
is because we want to look good in our
pictures that we post and there's
nothing wrong with wanting to look good
in pictures but there's something wrong
when it's an obsession I am so against
like crash diets and just like things
that promote like quick just like
starving yourself promotes quick get
skinny quick and like they'll promote it
using like these super hot airbrush
models using like on the Instagram and
it's just like makes me so mad because
that's not real but I don't I think this
video is extremely random but I just
want you guys to know that it's so not
good like it's so unhealthy and we just
need to have a chat and just talk about
it because I have so many friends who
are like this and I who don't eat or who
are obsessed with the way they look it
really makes me sad because it's kind of
like we can't help it we really can't we
think that like that is just how we have
grown up our whole life and like not
maybe not our whole life but like these
past recent years that is what we have
been told is good and now on to the
other spectrum where some people are
like let you're so like no you were like
the way you are is 100% if I don't even
want to change it that also is an
extreme where it's not good if you're
like very unhappy with the way you look
and you know that you can be healthier
and you can make healthier choices but
you're just lazy like if you want to
make healthier choices you can do that
don't let the extreme part of saying
like no you don't need to do anything
let you look not work out or not be
motivated or something like that because
I work out even though I know I'm skinny
I know I'm not fat I work out because I
enjoy it and because not even okay no
take that back
I don't enjoy working out but I enjoy
the feeling after I work out like wow I
actually did it like oh go me because
that's like my personal goal of my
accomplishment but I don't do that
that's not what makes me happy do you
see what the difference is like working
out to make you happy or working out
because you want to look like someone on
Instagram
that is gonna get you like a thousand
likes on your latest picture like that's
some negative thinking and would you
tell your daughter that like just ask
yourself this question would you tell
your daughter to starve herself to get
the most likes on Instagram if you would
then I honestly don't know what to tell
you but I don't think a lot of us would
and also it's just like two extremely
there's one half telling you not to do
anything and just to maintain an
unhealthy lifestyle and there's the
other half who's like no you need to
starve yourself to look like this or you
need to follow all of these crash diets
to look like this or do juice cleanses
to look like this like all that stuff
that does not work in the long run and
should not make you happy like if that
stuff we just sometimes I need to take
take myself like a step back and be like
whoa Natalie like I just did that
because like I just did that to get how
that makes stuff look good on social
media but that is not my real life you
know like that sort of stuff it just
makes me really sad and um I'm not like
crying or anything right now but I am
getting a little emotional because I'm
just thinking to certain instances and
just things where I have noticed girls
being so obsessed with their self-image
and it makes me cringe that I'm going to
need to raise my daughter in a society
where it's obsessed with themselves and
the way that they look only to please
other people we are not working out to
please ourselves we're working out to
please other people when we're doing all
these crash sites and all this this so
and then the other half is fitness so
there's nothing wrong with getting a
healthy lifestyle and having a healthy
lifestyle and wanting to eat healthy and
work out I commend you for doing that it
is just the intention behind it as you
have noticed I have been posting a lot
of fitness videos not a lot more than
normal which means I've actually posted
one fitness video any of us like to but
um so I'm posting some fitness videos
and I want to continue that because I
want to continue to motivate girls to
work out and be healthy in a healthy way
not in the way that portrays on social
media so that is why I feel like I can
kind of help with that because I want to
look good and I want to get strong and I
want to get fit for my own good but I
want to do it in a way that
it's like self positivity and like
self-love and stuff like that and also
so like I've started getting into
fitness and I actually so I've been
using this workout app which you guys
know like it's an all my it's in all
those videos you guys know I love that
app but when I joined that app I
actually also joined a Facebook group
it's the self-love challenge and on that
baseball group they had like they had
like a fitness challenge but in the
Facebook group everyone would comment
like look what I did today like here's
my accomplishment I'm so proud of myself
for doing this today like basically just
a self-love group and it was such a
positive thing to read all the comments
all the time and seeing where people
were and their fitness journeys and like
seeing people do the challenge like
every like it was like a daily challenge
thing and some people do it in and see
the progress and everyone like being
like oh my gosh like that is awesome you
go girl and keep it up or being like I
just had a really bad day and I couldn't
get myself out of that and people
commenting like really positive things
about it and I think that sort of
environment is so amazing so I like
fully supports work it for creating that
Facebook group I think and like just the
fact that it's a workout app and that
they are promoting self-love versus a
lot of workout apps that are promoting
hey take an Instagram picture in your
hot body and post it and then will
repost you so you can get more followers
versus that I just like respect
companies like that like that is what
the future should be like companies that
promote self-love not companies that
promote flaunting your body just for
other people's entertainment or just for
other people's jealousy because I know
all of us want other people to be
jealous of us I hope this video made
sense I hope it wasn't too random I hope
that helped you guys and also I want to
leave you with this that I am I share a
very strong base and I am a Christian I
have a very strong faith in God and I
know some of you may not but the way I
also view myself is that the creator of
the whole universe like think of like
beautiful things in the world like
mountains and beaches and all that stuff
he God which I believe God created that
and he created you and he created your
body you only get one body your body is
a temple
you only get one and you need to nourish
it and you need to
feed it with good things like you
shouldn't you shouldn't be destroying
your body and becoming obsessed with it
and you shouldn't worship your body
either you know so that's just like if
you constantly harm yourself or you
constantly are tearing yourself down
just in your mind and how do you think
that the person that created you feels
like if you created something and then
all of a sudden that thing's like ooh I
hate myself like what did I like I'm so
ugly I don't whatever you want to be
happy because you created that and you
thought it was a masterpiece so that's
just a little I want to leave you with
that so I hope that that makes sense and
I love you guys so much and how you
really needed to get this off my chest
because I have seen so much of girls
like their innocence down and just like
completely just it really really makes
me sad and I just wish that girls
wouldn't understand that they are
beautiful and they don't need to do all
the things that they do to be beautiful
and ditch not be the measure of their
happiness and don't compare yourself to
other people because everyone's bodies
are different just like everyone's piece
of art is different gods did not make us
all the same exact piece of art he
manipulated everything to hate like he
made us all different so that it's not
boring you know so yeah I hope that that
helped I think I'm gonna write like an
article on this on my becoming rooted
website it's a website that I have with
my friend Katie um it's like a self-love
like promoting girls just from being
insecure and stuff like that website we
have a blog to blog posts every week so
check it out um but yeah so I hope that
this made sense please comment down
below I love love love love love your
comments and I want this to kind of be
like that self-love Facebook page from
sworkit I was talking about I want it to
be that but I want it to be in my
comments below so please comment just
positive thoughts and everything like
that in other videos you might be able
to comment negative things but in this
one if there's negativity I'm going to
just take it off because this is not the
place for that alright so I hope that
you guys got something out of this talk
and please if you have anything like
please comment down below and I will
respond to you if you have anything
mind or anything that you want to ask me
your questions or just want to vent to
me because venting is good I didn t vent
into can't run what's good even though
it's random and jumbled up and might hum
not me might have not made sense um but
yeah and then also on my website that
was telling you about we have a prayer
request section so if you kind of want
to be anonymous or any planet just like
once I'm gonna pray over you for
anything in the world please write it on
there alright so I love you guys so much
and I hope that too this helped asan
feel so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
