requested video so far which is a makeup
collection video and I'm just going to
throw it with disclaimer out there just
because I have to UM my disclaimer is
that I do have a lot of makeup so not
gonna lie I mean it's not like I don't
have any makeup um just putting out
there but also I don't have as much as
most beauty gurus do so I don't have as
much as like Ella Blair I don't have as
much as like macbarbie 07 or just like
other like you two theories i do not
have as much as them but i mean i still
do have a lot and i have a lot more than
the average typical teenager so just

thumbs up sir stuff like that so they
are extremely requested so it's not like
I'm in my room be like I want to brag
about all the makeup I had like no this
is requested that is why I am doing it
so I'm just throwing that out there so
please do not like any hey comments and
especially since I stated this
disclaimer I expect no hate comments and
if you do it will be blocked so awesome
so I'm just going to get started and it
is I'm sitting on the floor right now
just because my room is not neat so I
don't really want to
see a messy room in the background and
my makeup up my makeup is in my bathroom
so it's not even where I film so it is
in a whole new setting so yeah I'm just
gonna get started with this and I hope
that you guys enjoy bye so this is where
I keep all of my makeup it is just in
these drawers but it's not in all of
these drawers it's just in these front
two drawers I keep it and I am in my
bathroom right now hi um so yeah I'm in
my bathroom right now and I just keep it
in those two drawers and um I keep it in
those drawers just because my mom
doesn't like it if it's seen it like out
on my counter so that's why I have to
keep it in my drawers and I do not have
that big of a drawer so it's kind of
hard now that I keep buying more makeup
but I mean it works and I have a lot
actually so it's actually works
perfectly fine this is it open so as you
can tell i do have quite a lot of makeup
especially for a 15 year old i'm just
going to show you guys what is in my
drawers and everything like that and
yeah so over here which is where I just
these aren't kept in drawers obviously I
have my brushes this is my face brushes
so it has like a bronzer stippling
foundation cheek more cheat contouring
like just anything for the face I have
right in this thing and I got this at
target and then I got these little beads
at Michaels and then back here I have
all my eye brushes which is just any I
brush that I find and then again I got
that target and the beads up Michaels
and back here it's kind of dark so you
can't really tell that well but I just
have a bag it's a sephora bag and I just
keep on my makeup that I don't use in
there and then I have some my glam bags
that um I don't use and then over here I
have my kabuki brush and my makeup

from Michael's all of these drawers are
from michaels and these containers I
mean not Michaels container store sorry
these are from the container store this
is where I keep my mac eyeshadows and
then I just have these two little
foundation things because just in case I
need them but I think I like got these
for free or something but here I just
have all of my neutral mac eyeshadows
and I just place them on their side
because they don't fit if I put them
this way and I can see the colors
through here so this is that um these
are all neutral and these are all
colorful mac eyeshadows this should go
over here because I like them all in a
row okay so yeah I just have two of
these and these work really well for mac
eyeshadows so I really like them and
then in this short I have my primers and
this is all my face primers and all my
eyeshadow primer is in this drawer I
have all of my does not designer but
like high and single eyeshadows except
this is a duo from NARS but I just put
it in here because it's not really like
a palette so I just have all of my
single high-end I shadows like the mac
ones that don't fit into here cuz
they're bigger I have in here I have
this is just like a little spider from
urban decay I have clinique i have laura
mercier i have Smashbox i have bare
minerals tokidoki wonder minerals yeah
just all of that I had single eyeshadows
over here I have all my drugstore

it today actually it is what is the
color ah margin and then i have my NARS
orgasm I have a mine are multiple I have
my benefit i have all my dream bouncy
blushes there's a bunch of blushes so
yeah and then down here i have all my
samples and this most of these I get in
my glam bag or just the department store
gives me a ton of samples if I ask them
and guys please do not be afraid to ask
the department store for samples cuz
that's the best way to try out a product
and that's what they're there for that
they have to give you samples so this is
all of my samples I have a ton of face
ones hair masks all the good stuff like
I really like sell these for money
because i have so many of them already
um and then i have my here i have like
Chanel foundation ones i have two of
them like this is a great way to save
money by sampling lens and then i have
my eye makeup remover back there that i
only use to fix up look if my mascara
goes on my way i don't really use it at
night to take off my makeup now to the
other side of the drawer we were just
here and now we're going here this store
has all of my mascaras in my eyelash or
my eyelash curler this set is by far my
favorite mascara oh just kidding this
one I just bought it recently is my
Lancome Hypnose doll lashes I've never
tried a better master in my life guys so
even though it's expensive it's
definitely worth it this is all of my
eyeliners I have all my gels around here
and then I have to find pencils and I my
liquids and I have a little palette like
12
box mini gel liners and I I um I pencil
but or whatever it's called sharpener
okay I don't know why I couldn't think
of that and then over here I have all my
face stuff so this is like my cause I
met our my concealer I have more
concealer I have foundation the
foundation more foundation I just have
like pressed powders concealer
middlefield Smashbox it's like a halo
thing I don't really know um mineral
veil well or this is well-dressed
actually and I have this thing that has
sulfur and that you put on top of your
pimples and it's like kind of covers
them at conceal them but it's also like
soul first like prevents is down here i
have my bronzers and this is actually a
palette of all three bronzer blush and
brightener so i keep it in here because
it has a bronzer and a brightener and i
actually like this because it tells you
like how to apply it in the back so i
have this by two things I my baked Urban
Decay bronzer hoola bronzer I have my
son game I have Bobby Brown highlighter
a tart sample highlighter and then I
have a mere add i think it's called um
it's a bronzer that you can like mixing
with your foundation or just apply it to
your facebook over here i have all my
lip stuff and i actually need to get
into rum a lipstick holder because i
don't i have a ton of lipsticks but will
anyone let me know if the lipstick
holder they sell at the container store
it fits these things because i have a
lot of Revlon lip butters and if it
doesn't fit like the square ones or
anything then there's no point because i
only have two mac lipsticks so I needed
for drug store the guys have a ton of
lipsticks and lip glosses and a lot of
Revlon lip butters and a lot of just a
lip stuff and then down there is my
eyeshadow basis and I have decided to
try out the the color tattoos and tried
bad to the bronze first and fell in love
with it then I decided to get this
pomegranate when I think it's called and
I haven't tried it yet but I'm sure I'll
love it I actually do need to wear a
primer with these though they're not as
good as Mac Paint Pots for my lid but
for some people they work awesome but
with a primer they stay on forever i'm
here i just have all my bases I have
with my little jumbo shadows state
that and I have some I know what that is
it's a roll one glimmer but I didn't
have anywhere else to put it and then I
have some more like cream shadows by
urban decay and I got these for three
dollars on sale at their website so
these are awesome i really like these
ton of colors back there I have all of
my paint pots and my color tattoos so
yeah this is just a drawer of bases and
this is probably my favorite works i'm
obsessed with like this dream shot or
dream whatever it's called color tattoos
and paint pots so there you have it
that's my makeup collection I really
hope that you guys enjoyed this video
and so like I said I don't have as much
as other people but I do have a lot more
than the typical teenagers so really
