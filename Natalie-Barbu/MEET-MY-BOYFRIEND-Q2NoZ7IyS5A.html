I just drove about two hours because I
work in a city called High Point North
Carolina and I come home every single
weekend and it's like about a two-hour
drive back
so yeah I drove back and I decided to
vlog this weekend there's nothing really
that special going on but I just kind of
I was editing my California vlogs and re
watching them and I really like vlogging
home and the best feeling coming home is
this free people bag look guys like mmm
freakin love three people and it's like
a heavy bag they have an sale which was
like half off of all of their sale
there's no good he doesn't like being in
my belongs
okay so yeah um come hang out with me
this weekend we found peak of my haul so
I'm gonna be showing those things um and
maybe some of these but yeah the bag is
so cute and then I realized I left the
battery charging so I'm not about to go
back to my house so for tonight my phone
will do even though my friend camera
like really sucks cuz my
it's always on and I tried rubbing it
off and it just never never is totally
clear so I'm sorry about that but I'm
just like on cloud freakin nine right
now I am in the best mood nothing can
kill my mood I'm so happy
but yeah good things are coming and I
love you guys so much and I just like to
thank YouTube for everything like oh my
gosh you guys are hands-down the
greatest people in the world not even
kidding you guys are seriously the
greatest people every single one of my
subscribers that has stuck with me
through my break that I had on YouTube
every one of my subscribers that is new
and actually decided to hit subscribe
everyone that takes the time to actually
write a comment on my videos because I
watched so many of YouTube videos and I
barely leave comments on any of them and
I'm so guilty of that but like thank you
guys so much those make my freaking day
they make my life like I'm just like so
thankful for you guys hi guys so the
mowing guys have all been waiting for
to meet my voice Pokemon master hello
beautiful feet say your name his name is
Colin introducing great group of people
I was telling you guys what I hear
yeah we're going to dinner and I'm
driving
guys I'm a strong independent woman and
I can drive my own car
good morning guys today is the second
day of this weekend
vlog and I finally have my camera back
so that's good like I put the battery in
it but right now I'm just heading to
Starbucks
it is currently 9:00 a.m. and I woke up
at 7 naturally because I've been waking
up at like 6:30 every single morning for
work so naturally my body just wakes up
at 7 o'clock I don't really like it
because I'm exhausted at night and I
just feel like I don't have enough hours
of sleep because I felt like one
yesterday but yeah so I'm going to start
my stead at my California lookbook what
I needs to be up by 2 like today or
tomorrow because it's so delay the Lana
if you guys are wondering which you guys
probably aren't but I am still in my
great mood that I was in earlier so
that's that's good so I'm just gonna jam
out in my car for the two minute
Starbucks ride that I have to kind of
get me more awake
hey guys so I just Starbucks and edited
the video it's 11:15 it took about two
hours which like isn't bad actually but
so funny like took two hours for a four
minute long video that's kind of insane
I am so jittery right now it isn't
Starbucks like I said and I got a venti
I'm gonna put this like we should get
like set it down
venti vanilla latte I spent no latte and
I just like I'm like shaking I feel so
jittery I haven't eaten anything so
that's all I had today and I my leg was
like constant shaking like people must
have thought I was on drugs or something
I mean I guess I technically was
caffeine is a drug right um but yeah so
I was just like so shaky I'm still so
shaky I just need I need food and me I
need it I just feel so productive this
is why I need to do a job where I'm just
my own boss because I need to do things
in my way like I can't sit in an office
for eight hours and not I don't know
like yeah productive
it might work stuff but like my job but
deep cool up it's like Natalie here
driving to Colin's house right now I'm
gonna pick him up to go to lunch you
guys must think I Drive all the time he
drives all the time because he's like
doesn't have gas and I was just like
okay like I have a full tank well I have
half a tank of gas actually no I'm not
allowed to go from
hi guys so we just got down to church
it's Sunday morning currently and we're
just walking around are you doing we're
also playing Pokemon and I just hatched
my egg and I got my very first Pikachu
so I'm really excited about that if any
of you guys played Pokemon let me know
in the comments I really like it I think
it's a great game great concept me and
my brother are playing he's like way
ahead of me though but yeah I just got
my first Pikachu in an egg supposedly
that's like the rarest thing you can get
so I'm really excited there's like a ton
of learners here so you guys don't play
pokemon well then you probably have no
idea what I'm talking about but it's a
lot of fun so good good things are
happening
hey that's what level Pokemon are you
why don't you ever want to be in a
seventeen seventeen so why don't you
ever want to know nothing that night
wait wait not like that straight mom
doesn't have to be straight
currently taking a shoe picture
Oh girls cuz we all have like neutral
colors she's on if any of you guys were
wondering how these are done this is how
they are done there's so many lers
around here there's alert right there
there's like more lers oh yeah and this
Park I think we're gonna go here there's
so many layers I'm excited so I am
trying to upload a video and I feel like
all my vlogs I try to upload a video and
then I have some sort of technological
issue so if you guys are not youtubers
and you probably think like damn get
your computer fixed but I mean this like
might be just a domino memory I need
like a bigger hard drive or more RAM on
my laptop and it's I'm like using a
laptop and most people use desktop
computers but seriously the amount of
issues I have uploading like a booty is
hours long the process and it's not like
like my friends are like I'm just like
leave it uploading and sometimes I do it
and I risk it and like sometimes it
works but most of the time there's
always some issue in the middle that's
like re-upload it and it's the most
annoying thing ever I hate it so much so
it just makes me because there's so much
to do today
and I I'm so much to do today as I'm
laying down but I'm like monitoring my
upload process and it's like not going
well so yeah it's just what it won't let
you guys know like my page this is the
longest it's gone it's at 50% isn't that
a cute picture of me
hello guys so I wanted to show you guys
my outfit of the day I'm actually going
to New York next week
- this is typically like I tuck it in a
little bit but I'll be wearing this
exactly so when I vlog and I'm wearing
the same one you guys don't need to let
me know I know I'm an outfit repeater
but this top is from H&amp;amp;M really cute off
the shoulder but then has like these
straps so it's not annoying and then I
have this necklace which I wore
yesterday I love this necklace I feel
like you can wear it with so much even
though it's like so colorful and then I
have this skirt from Free People and I
got this on sale I think for like $15
it's a great deal and then my shoes are
just mine really nice like bare feet I
am wearing a watch and it is from Jordan
if you want to enter to win and go and
watch my California lookbook that's the
one I'm actually uploading some one time
you guys watch this you guys will see it
and yeah did my hair like this I don't
know if I like it do you guys like it
let me know if you guys like it I don't
know if I like this poop it really
reminds me of like middle school when
everyone had the pouf and I just I I
don't know so let me know so I can get
like an honest opinion
Oh right now I am currently packing and
this is how I pack some of you guys
actually were wondering how I packed I
remember you guys asking me that and the
last San Francisco vlog that I did so
basically what I do is I just like that
dress I had already tried on they know
how it looks so I didn't try it on but I
just like trying on my things because
it's the worst when you go somewhere and
you pack a super cute outfit and then
you try it on it actually looks really
bad so yeah I just lay them all out it's
a sneak peek of what I am wearing and
then I count them up like okay so like
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday you
know just to make sure that I have the
right amount and I started packing I am
actually going to New York for next week
right after my internship ends I'm
getting on a flight to New York I
actually haven't booked it yet funny
story but I'm booking it soon and I
don't even know the end date so that's
why I'm packing the most I'll go for is
I think like 10 days and then the least
amount of time I'll go for is about
seven or eight so that is why I'm just
like packing extra and in case I decide
to go out one night
of this I want to film doctor just hold
videos so I brought some like jeans and
a jacket cuz like for example these
shorts you can't really wear back to
school so that's why I decided to do
that to the end if you guys want to see
my stage right now hey guys what's up a
date it's all fit I knew it would and
I'm actually surprised at how packed it
is because my shoes I still need to put
like my makeup and toiletries in there
cuz I'm checking it in so that's why I
have this like massive it's suitcase so
yeah there it is
sneak peek at what I will be wearing so
I like an hour or so and I just wanted
to say that to finish it so I want to
say thank you guys for watching if you
made it this far I'm about to be going
to New York tomorrow so the logging
won't begin then let me know if you guys
like my vlogs any criticism or feedback
so yeah let me know and I hope you guys
enjoyed it have a wonderful week weekend
