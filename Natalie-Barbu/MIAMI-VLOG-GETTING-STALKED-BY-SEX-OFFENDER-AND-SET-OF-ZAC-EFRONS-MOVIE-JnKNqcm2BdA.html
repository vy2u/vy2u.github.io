really want to meet him and this is the
set in the background if you guys can
see I'm in love with him and we're
trying to really casually walking around
trying to find them Katie Lee brought
her suitcases leaving the airport at
least I do I'm going to do anything you
guys see those super shirtless shirtless
like you can't be like shirtless and
like swinging on these like ropes and
stuff like that it's right here I'm
literally witnessing it so I will
videotape that follow me on snapchat
because I've been like do post posting a
lot of snapchats like what I've been up
to to CFO me on that I like put that
right here
alright guys so update they've been
filming here for the past four days four
days we've been here for four days and
it's only like five miles away from my
apartment and we came here today on the
fifth day and they're gone they stopped
filming today but daily comes to see
them literally like we could have seen
him just there just right there like our
luck so yeah now he's moving to Savannah
Georgia so if anyone's in Savannah you
guys showed that go see em and I will be
jealous of you
yeah Katie's leaving right now she's
flying back to the Charlotte I know and
then we have an extra day and we're just
gonna go to South Beach again but yeah
I'm like really this is just I knew this
was gonna happen it's just my luck
honestly I have never really met any
famous people in everybody never have we
came to the sets a good thing it's like
on the way to South Beach so we didn't
like totally go out of the way but yeah
it's pretty unfortunate hopefully next
time doc my friend if you're watching
this hit me up okay guys so it is super
dark in here but this came with my
hey guys so I just wanted to apologize
first of all for being a horrible
vlogger these past two days I think I
did pretty good
in the beginning of spring break and
then a swing break I just kind of slowly
went downhill but I kind of wanted to do
a story time for you guys in this vlog
because something very interesting
happened so yesterday of two days ago
let's start this out I don't know if you
saw on my Twitter but I kind of posted
something briefly about this um but so
we were sitting on the beach like me and
the four girls like Katie Mackenzie and
Renae we were sitting on the beach and
we just like decided to move down a
little bit whatever so we put a new spot
on the beach there were some girls
around our image behind us and we like
Renae starts noticing that the girls
don't like cracking up dying laughing
and so she looks and then she's like oh
my god she's Natali like we gotta leave
we can need to leave I was like what so
she tells me she look don't look right
now but she's like there's a guy next to
them with his penis out on the sand a
hole in his shorts with his penis out
just touching it's doing really
disgusting things I am so sorry if you
were like age 12
like maybe turn this off I don't know
but very very disturbing so we freaked
out and we start like putting on our
cover-ups taking our towels leaving he
gets it and then the other girls like I
don't know why they were laughing like
what the heck like you don't laugh at
that they were he was literally like
this close to them um and he was like
right behind us like a foot behind us
just staring at us and I like looked
over at him and he went like this I was
like
oh my god oh my god oh my god like it
was so scary I we got up and left and
then the guy cuts up and he leaves too
and we're kind of freaking out we're
like okay like he could not be following
us whatever so he actually ended up
going like away from the beach so he
didn't follow us that time and so that
was just kind of freaky whatever new
days we still like we're there for a few
hours so yesterday we my friend Alan
she it was in South Beach with her
friends and so we went back down South
Beach and with this time we were at
around 10th Street and which is maybe
like I want to say like a mile maybe
even two miles down from where we were
yesterday so like totally new place like
probably two miles away from where we
were yesterday where we saw that man
and so and he looked like a bear like he
looks like a homeless man like he did
not look like nor like he looked like
there was just like something about now
that homeless people like something off
about them but he was like a very
uncomfortable man to be doing that like
any man would be very uncomfortable
doing that but like I don't know it just
was very very creepy was very old and so
weird with my friend Alden and we're
like with a bunch of college kids now
like this is like a totally new scene
like miles down the road and I'm laying
down whatever we're tanning and then we
see Renee again Renee happens to be the
most observant one I guess she's like oh
my gosh he's here and so I look up and
the man is sitting right in front of us
right in front of us doing the exact
same thing he was doing yesterday this
time he didn't have a shirt on though so
that's nice and staring at us literally
his back cuz he was in front of us this
time so his back was turned like that
just staring at us and I freaked the
fact that we were miles down the road
from where we were yesterday and he
still managed to find us I feel like I'm
like being trapped or something like it
was just it was so scary so I get up we
all got up and we're so scared and so I
call I call the police and I'm on the
phone with the police and like literally
I'm just like listen
this is what's happening this happened
yesterday happened today like someone
needs to get this man off the beach like
I don't know who else he does this you
know it's just like very very disturbing
and stuff like that and so I don't
really think the police did anything
there were like hundreds of people on
the beach I don't think that they could
have found him when we got up he got up
and followed us he followed us so we're
very scared so we go up to the lifeguard
Hut and we're like he's watching us go
to the lifeguard Hut like watching us go
up there and we tell them we're like
listen like this man like he needs to
like he needs to leave and so like this
is what's it happening like we're very
scared and so the lifeguard man he is
like oh my gosh like you'll never
believe this he used to live on the side
of my house when I lived in Cuba so like
I don't really know what that means he
lived on the side of his house but like
he used to live on the side of my house
and I lived in Cuba I know him like I'm
just gonna talk to him whenever he talks
to him and the man that gets off the
beach and then he comes back up to us
and he's like you know like that guy in
Cuba he was in jail for a few years for
being a sex offender and I'm just like
why like we're all freaking out because
that is so weird
that that man that was doing that
doesn't surprise me at all but was a sex
offender I don't know if he's like a
registered sex offender in the US or if
he's if he was just like in Cuba I spend
her I don't know but yeah and so the guy
so nonchalantly was like it's fine I
know him and he was a sex offender in
Cuba it's fine I just hope to get off
the beach and I'm sitting there like
what like he needs to like go back to
jail or something because that was so
scary he obviously was not leaving us
alone at all like he was just sitting
there so oh my gosh it was just like so
scary and the fact that he was doing
that it wasn't even like he was just
sitting there like kind of being like
creepy just looking at us like that
would be weird but like not weird enough
to call the cops he was like very
indecent publicly exposed touching
himself while staring at us and sticking
his tongue out at us it was just the
most disgusting thing I've ever
experienced in my life this video is
very long but yeah so that was my little
story time video for you guys he got off
the beach I don't know if the police
really did anything I really don't think
they did but um yeah so that was very
very scary and I am just going to leave
this here because I gotta pack up and
then I'm going to the airport so I'm
literally doing nothing fun today
I'm sorry for these two days sucking at
vlogging but hopefully this story time
made up for it but yeah so it was very
scary any of you guys have anything like
that that happens you guys please
