coming to you with a morning routine and
I'm really excited to film this just cuz
I am a morning routine and so long
so it's good to be back I guess the
routine of things alright so today I am
excited because obviously morning
routines are going to lot today I'm
actually excited because a company
contacted me recently and I do not do
videos unless I fully believe in them
for other companies
I really don't work with all of our
companies a lot most of my videos like
99% of them are completely just me no
other companies even involved but today
um a company contacted me in their skin
care company and I have been loving
their products I don't know if you guys
know this but I have broken out so
portably this looks like the whole month
of October and November so the full 2
month of October November I can't break
up all along here all along my two
cheeks right here are on my chin and
cheeks and then like a triangle it's the
Bermuda Triangle on my forehead so if
you're talking out that company and I am
loving it so far it's really clear right
skiing a lot and just made it feel nice
and just more refreshed and I've been
using a lot of CVS products and just
like drugstore products and they're fine
but I can tell if they leave my skin
very dry and just I've been peeling a
lot on my chain from it - and I just
wanted something a little more gentle
because we're in the winter
my skin's gettin a little more sensitive
and my skin is never sensitive in the
summer but in the winter it's just a
little more sensitive just because of
the dry weather outside so I'm excited
to try these babies out and I actually
love them and for what you get is very
cheap it's $40 for this whole kit and
that's including a free
microdermabrasion scrub I will link the
links down below and you can use my
coupon code that I have for you guys or
not but I mean my favorite Martin my
lovin microdermabrasion stress are the
best like true story I once spent $80 on
one and robotics twice because it's a
cleanser a two serums the clear ports a
clear for serum and an acne treatment
serum and then it also comes with a
toner and the microdermabrasion scrub
all for $40 and a little chart to kind
of guide you on tips on how to clear
your skin and your morning and eat me
your teen so I know that was really cool
I like when companies see me routines to
follow because then I actually follow
them whereas if I just by random things
with CVS I like use one at night use one
in the morning sometimes switch em up
like you know just so make sure you can
check it out it's all natural
ingredients too and they have a
money-back guarantee so if you guys
don't like it you guys brought it in our
life sucks I'd rather just shop at
Target you get your money back so which
I don't think that you guys will be
saying that swords come stores it's
clear like it was free you should try a
sample of it so yeah make sure that you
check them out in the
in below sink below you know the thing
that I post things in sure you give this
video a huge thumbs up let me know what
other videos you guys want I'm filming
about five videos this week so that's so
exciting I gotta go charge my camera
actually just it's ready for the day
tomorrow so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
this video
and okay so much so well yeah bye guys
make sure you're subscribed to
so my morning starts off like basically
any other persons morning kind of
rolling in bed and not wanting to get up
and then I finally makes the move and by
the way I have shorts on under it this
looks like I'm showing you guys my
underwear
it's my shorts they're just really short
again keep that in mind
first thing I like doing is just a quick
like 5 10 minute ab workout just because
if I don't do anything else that day at
least I didn't add workout you know
that's kind of my logic and then I move
on to just washing my face so I've been
using expose ed skincare which I
mentioned in the intro I love and very
much so first I just start off with the
facial cleanser it's just like any other
facial cleanser but they use all natural
ingredients like green tea extract and
stuff like that so that's what I really
like about it just because it feels more
refreshing and cooler on my face and
yeah I've just been really loving it and
I apply my anti acne serum and then I
just go in with a regular moisturizer
doesn't need to be anything special I
just like using a vino which I really
really like too
then I run down the stairs awkward late
that looks just like really weird but I
make myself a smoothie for breakfast so
I was actually going to lunch with my
friend Katie in about two hours so I
just want a big breakfast so I just
started off with strawberries banana
agave almond milk and she has these and
I start off by putting a strawberries in
it a banana and I actually added some
spinach leaves and how good is this
agave look
looks amazing then I purchased these and
I basically make it a milkshake because
I like fill it to the top of the milk
but it doesn't it's very good like you
might not put all those combinations
together and this is my first time
please spinach it might smoothie believe
it or not and it doesn't look the best
it's kinda brownish red color but it was
really really good I'm gonna start
making this like every school morning
the best part about coming home for me
is the smoothies because I can't really
mix amoeba college then voila my bed is
made just like that wouldn't it be nice
if it was that easy your place changing
was as easy as standing in front of a
mirror staring at yourself and then snap
oh I'm dressed
fun facts I've had this polo since I was
in 83 years old
it was my older sisters when I was three
and she was about nine and now I guess
it fits me I don't know weird um but I
still have mine from when I was three
then I brush my teeth after I drink my
city and now I see my makeup on I left
all my makeup at college so I'm using
Chloe's makeup which is a little dark
for me but you know I'm gonna make it
work and she doesn't own concealers so I
can even conceal my blemishes that much
but I just went very very simple today
basically it was not wearing makeup I
just did a little bit of foundation
powder highlighter and then I applied
some blush with my fingers just cuz she
doesn't really have any brushes either
so good thing we had this blush but I
actually really really like it I think
it looks super natural when you rub it
in with your fingers let me know what
you guys think and then I just go in
with mine
I shadow and stuff so yeah I just
applied a very simple I shadow and I use
my naked 2 palette and then I went in
with my tiara and I called it a day with
my
and then I met with my friend Katie and
vanilla
