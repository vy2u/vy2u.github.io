today I am filming a drive with me as
you guys can tell but this one is
special because it's a drive with me but
it's Coachella version or Coachella
edition because I'm one of those
annoying people that has to talk about
going to Coachella when I have my
tickets so yeah you know that meme
that's like the kid with like the veiny
face and it's like when you're going to
Coachella but I haven't told anyone in
five minutes that's me right now I
thought it was fitting to do a Coachella
Drive with musician so I'm gonna be
showing you as my favorite songs of the
Coachella season I guess the Coachella
Festival I'll be playing my top songs

little nasally because I woke up and I
had stuffy nose and a little bit of a
sore throat and I'm sneezing like every
five seconds and I have a little bit of
a headache so that's amazing because I
go to LA tomorrow so I mean perfect
timing I'm hoping it's just allergies
because then once I get to California
I'll be good but I have a feeling it
might be a cold so I'm going to target
to stock up on like random like
last-minute things and also to stock up
on a bunch of vitamins and yeah because
I am so good I'm just going I just
pulled over on the side of the road and
I'm just gonna be playing my Coachella
playlist and this will be available like

below so it's gonna be a public Spotify
playlist but I'm just gonna start
playing songs from people going that I
am so excited to see and this is not the
official Coachella playlist island made
my own because I didn't really like some
of those songs on there you know and I
don't like know over half the people

construction everywhere everywhere
there's construction yeah I just don't
know who you guys are was excited to see
if you if you've ever been to Coachella
if you are going this year if you want
to go next year I did a whole vlog on
how I like how much Coachella really
costs and how much I'm paying for it how
I can afford it because I'm not going on
with a brand or anything like me and my
roommate just like bought tickets so I
am so excited and pumped and I just like
didn't think I was gonna get to go this
year and then I got to go and it was
just like a very happy moment when I
found out I was going and yeah okay
what's what's next on the agenda of
songs
oh yes I'm so excited to see Laney - I
don't know many of their songs but
with the stripe with me I want to let
you guys know I am going to be vlogging
so I'll be vlogging every day but I
think I'm just gonna compile okay this
car in front of me is maybe going five
miles per hour that's nice I'm just
gonna compile a whole weekend in my life
on this channel so if you guys subscribe

want to do a get ready with me every
single day I'm just like super casual
like who just talked to you guys while
I'm doing my makeup I mean my roommate

soon as I add in it just like upload to
get ready with me and then on Tuesday
I'll upload the weekend in my life and I
hope that you guys like that because I'm
so excited to be filming that too
seriously it is like playing like a
video game on these Rolly roads with the
amount of freaking potholes air bar I am
not kidding it's so ridiculous it is so
ridiculous
I'm pissed I'm angry this not like
really get your crap together and don't
bust my car I sorry if I sound like a
little
brat or something but it is I literally
broke an axle because of a pothole
so I'm bitter about it so I'm not over
it yes I'm so excited to see guy go I am
so excited this is my favorite like most
anticipated
somebody
that is definitely my most excited to
see that it's on Friday
yes I'm more excited to see like those
types of people rather than the
headliners I've said it before I just
like I don't think the headliners this
year were great no offense I thought
that they could have done better
oh my gosh if this doesn't remind you of
middle school or high stress when your
sophomore year in high school I don't
know what does I know all the words of
this song and I thought I was so cool
knowing all the way into an Eminem song
but I seriously did and he better
perform this I don't think he will I
don't know any of us new stuff so he
better perform his old
get another chance there's no K what to
leave out the window guess this one I
call it window pane
all right that's enough I needed to
prove that I could rap
seriously though that used to be my
favorite song ever like I was obsessed
with that song I think I would like
practice rapping in my room alone can
you imagine
I love the bleachers you guys they are
one of them they have become one of my
favorite bands it is Jack Antonoff
is that I say his last name he used to
be engaged to Lena Dunham which I am NOT
a fan of hers personally I think that
he's so talented I really really like
him and I'm just excited to hear them
live it's just like a fun group to dance
around too so I'm so excited
do you like my head
I can't lip saying you guys like as hard
as I try any time I tried lip singing I
just do got this is like I just feel
like I fit so I really open that in the
editing process when you guys see me or
when I'm singing it doesn't sound like
that because that would just be really
embarrassing
I am excited to see an O mo are you
saying it this is Diplo song but it's
with and oh I don't know I don't know
how to say it I'm sorry
don't don't come for me
I'm gonna get
I'm going
I'm just sitting in the parking lot so
it imagine if any of the cars around me
they all have tinted windows someone
sitting in them my car does not have
tinted windows but I could imagine me be
like going viral on YouTube like look at
this girl like jamming out in her car
like yeah that's me guys if you see it
if I stop the video here because I'm
just sitting in the parking lot I think
that this video really cured me of my
sickness I feel so much better so if you
guys are sick right now
go drive in your car and blast music and
sing along to it and just go hard and
you might feel a little better I don't
know I feel I feel like more alive watch

gonna be like like dead again but I feel
so much better
