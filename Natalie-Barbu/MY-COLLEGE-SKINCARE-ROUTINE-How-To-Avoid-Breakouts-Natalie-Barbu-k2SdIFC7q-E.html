I am filming my skincare routine video
this video is probably one of the most
requested videos that I have in my
comments especially whenever I do vlog
style videos and I'm not wearing any
makeup my skin has been pretty clear and
I would definitely say that this has
been this year that my skin has been the
best last year I did a skincare routine
where I talked about how I cleared my
acne so this say I was going to be a
little different because I did switch up
a couple products and I also it's not
really a how I cleared my acne but kind
of how I maintain my skin to me this
clear and how I avoid breakout during
college because I have an extremely acne
prone skin all the time during the
school year typically freshman sophomore
and junior year I had broken out very
much during the school year it's been
pretty bad last year was actually my
worst bumps like family planning it for
sponsoring this video it's been for
perfect skin up brush that I will be
showing you guys is said to me by them
but trust me guys I use this every
single night you guys can see in my
blogs if you subscribe to my blog
channel that I will be posting soon and
everything like that I really do use
this product I've used other brushes
like this in the past
but this is the one I'm currently using
and I cannot wait to talk to you guys
about it let's get into my skincare
routine so the first thing that I use in
the morning is this acne org cleanser
you guys saw this in my last skincare
routine I actually purchased the big
bottle so I'm pretty sure in that one I
was showing you guys a little one and
just repurchased it's pretty dirty the
bottle honestly but I use that as a
cleanser in order to use that I really
feel like during the school year I need
to kind of get deep into my pores to
clear my skin versus the summer where I
basically never wear makeup and I don't
have any stress in the world so I've
been using this it's the spin for
perfect skin brush I also have a coupon
code for you guys so if you guys click
the link down below you guys will use my
coupon code the code is for 70% off so
be sure to click the link down below and
get your brush they really like this one
because let me tell you it comes with
four different heads that you can attach
so I'm just using this one this is for
my face and the three extra brushes
which are not just for your face which
is nice the reason why I like these
brushes is because I think it's
extra step in your skincare routine
during the school year like I said I
really do break out a lot more than not
during the school year and this year is
the first year I have actually not
broken out if you don't believe me you
can be feel free to watch videos from
the past I just feel like this is the
best way to could actually get deep down
into your pores I use this in the
morning and the night but for the
morning I think it's nice because it
exfoliates your skin and it just takes
off that whole dead layer of it and it
makes you more radiant and bright and it
just go makes your makeup go on smoother
and if you're not just having to wear
makeup it just makes your skin look more
alive which is something I need cuz the
lack of sleep is real and I just put it
on and I just let it go for as long as I
want it just vibrates and the bristles
go all around your face
I don't ever wash my face for longer
than like 30 seconds to be honest so I
don't do this for like two minutes
typically I only know anywhere between
late 10 to 20 seconds I don't want to
overdo my skin I want to overdo it and
then dry it out and then that would make
me break out so I only do it for about
10 to 20 seconds after I've washed my
face I go in with a toner so I have been
using this African - black soap toner
and I spray this all over my face you
just spray it I don't use a cotton ball
or anything close my eyes and spray and
I get this at Target the Shea Moisture
one I know I used to use one from lush
but I think I like this one better just
because it has a couple of added
ingredients other than Africa or other
than tea tree oil but tea tree oil is
amazing for acne prone skin it's an
anti-inflammatory so it will make sure
that your pimples are not like red and
inflamed and I'm pretty sure is it an
antibacterial I'm not sure but it helps
reduce the appearance of breakouts and
then it has tamarind extract in this
which is a natural astringent helps
exfoliate and brighten skin and it has
african black soap which is a natural
remedy for blemish troubled skin I'm
trying to steer away from like only
using salicylic acid and benzoyl
peroxide so I like that this is a toner
that does not use that and then after
that I have been using the acne donut
work
treatment so this is benzoyl peroxide
but this is the only thing in my regimen
that uses that sly this on top of the
toner and
just let it sit and let it dry before I
put on any moisturizer or makeup but it
doesn't dry my skin out I've been using
it for like over a year and I really
really like it I feel like I feel more
protective when I have an extra layer
that's on my skin like all day that is
fighting a breakout so I really do like
that you don't wash it off and it just
sits on your skin and it's super super
light you don't like see it or feel it
on top of your makeup and then in the
morning I use this Burt's Bees
brightening even skin tone moisturizing
cream I've been really really loving it
I try like I've kind of been shown you
to not use too many acne prone or acne
anti acne fighting products I guess
because I think that those dry out your
skin a lot so you really have to be
careful with what you do that's why with
a brush I like that it kind of gets deep
into your pores so that's basically the
only thing I really need if you use the
benzoyl peroxide just because again like
I said it makes me feel better having
that and I do think it helps but I
really try for all my other things that
I put on my skin to not be drying
especially because I don't wear too much
makeup during the school year I like
using this because it just makes my face
appear brighter and we're alive and it
goes on really nicely once my skin is
exfoliated and it just makes me have a
look kind of like a natural glow I also
really like Burt's Bees just in general
because they use natural ingredients and
I think that's really important when
you're looking at skincare is to see the
ingredients and know what you are
putting onto your skin that it for the
morning so now I'm going to talk about
the nighttime routine which is
essentially the same thing I just have a
few extra products and a few different
steps that I use the first thing I do at
night is take off my makeup and my
favorite thing to take off my makeup has
actually changed I used to only use
makeup wipes and now I don't even have
makeup wipes into my bathroom I have
been using this ciate makeup melter so
this is the thing I have picked up
recently I absolutely love it if you
guys have any other like makeup melters
are kind of like bombs or oils that take
off your makeup let me know because this
one's about to run out and I'd love to
try a new one but basically you just
apply take a spoonful I kind of just put
like two fingers or one finger and then
rub it all over my face and it
completely melts my makeup away I use
waterproof mascara every single day and
it takes it off completely I use
eyeliner foundation like you name it
anything
it completely takes my makeup off and
then I go in with my cleanser so I
actually start off with these same exact
cleanser that I showed you guys the acne
I ordered one and I use the brush I like
about this brush though is that it's not
drying so the bristles are really really
soft and gentle it's not like a harsh
bristle I feel like I've seen other
brushes where these little bristles are
super super hard so it's not like that
at all it's really soft honestly I've
never felt like my skin was like burning
or in pain or like super exfoliating
afterwards it just helps you exfoliate
and get deep down into your pores
instead of just using your fingers and
kind of just brushing the surface of it
because your makeup needs to come off I
then apply the same steps with the tea
tree oil and benzoyl peroxide so I'm not
going to go through that again but then
for the moisturizer I use this Pacifica
coconut probiotic water repair water
rehab cream so it's this cute little
bottle and it smells amazing at first
when I put it on my skin I actually
thought it was a hand lotion so I had to
like read the bottle be like wait is
this for my skin it is for your skin I
really thought it was a lotion just
because it smelled so strong and smelled
like a lotion and some of you guys I
know don't like having fragrance on your
face for me personally that doesn't
bother me I don't get breakouts or
allergic reactions from the fragrance so
I think it's really really nice that
smells like coconut which is one of my
favorite scents and it really hydrates
your skin so that's why I applied this
at night because at night I want my skin
to restore and so I apply that in night
light I kind of apply more than I
probably should
and my very generous amount and I let it
stay on my skin and absorb and again
because my skin is exfoliated it's so
much easier to absorb I know I sound
like a broken record but I never really
realized the importance of exfoliating
until I started doing it everyday so I
definitely recommend doing that it just
helps any serums or toners or cleansers
getting to your skin because you don't
have a layer of dead skin anyway so that
is it for like my skincare routine I
didn't want to show you guys because I
feel like it's kind of hard to film just
like me washing my face like I don't
know I feel like this is just better
sitting down and having a chance to
thoroughly explain
personal products and why I think it's
contributed to clearing out my skin
other things I do is I drink a lot more
water than I used to I've been working
out a lot more so having that in your
routine I definitely think helps and it
helps you de-stress I do think so but
mainly the main thing for me is that I
have learned to exfoliate and I think
before during the school years I just
never did that and I don't know if when
you're stressed you get more like
buildup on your skin I don't really know
the whole science behind it I just know
it helps and you're gonna look so much
more alive you're gonna look so much
more awake and your skin is just gonna
appear really glowy if you guys can't
tell I mean I have makeup on right now
but I just feel like my skin looks good
it looks healthy it looks even and I
don't have like it's not like cakey or
anything like that like you can still
see my skin through I hope you guys
