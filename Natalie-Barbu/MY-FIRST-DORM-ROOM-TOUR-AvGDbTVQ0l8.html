is actually a privately owned dorm for
our school so it actually isn't with our
actual college but anyways this is what
it is when you enter the door my back is
facing the door so this is my side of
the room so here's my bed
it is a extra-long twin size bed that is
what all dorms come with and right over
here I have my
kind of picture frame that kind of looks
like a window which I really like I have
punch pictures of friends and family

live life happy with a bunch of parts on
it and then here is my bed I have a lot
of pillows especially for a twin bed but
