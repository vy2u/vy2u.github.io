here and today I am coming to you guys
with the super casual video I am
currently in Miami right now you guys
can smell that the change of scenery and
I just hold onto some of you a tip by
tiny a general genus I will be in Europe
so oh yeah I'm excited
I cannot believe them so long and I love
that you guys get to know me through
these I think we become best friends and
I just love the response I get so I ask
you guys questions on snapchat and on
Instagram so if you guys want to be a
part of the next QA then it follow me on
both of those also follow me on Twitter
I feel like I don't know if any of you
guys on Twitter just they don't talk 100
often just one sitter two names follow
me on them so I already started my
snapchat questions so you lovely humans
asking questions on snapchat and I loved
it I got such a great response but you
like I get more of snapchat more like no
one else can see that you're asking it
but the first question I got is if you
could go anywhere it was only one person
where would it be and with you if I saw
anywhere I have a bucket list of places
I really want to go I want to go to
Thailand I want to go to Japan I live in
Australia I want to go to Canada I want
to go to just other countries I want to
go to a lot more countries in Europe
than I have been I was in South America
so I kind of want to travel the world
and I'm usually want to meet up with my
boyfriend or just really good friends
and family I feel like it's always more
fun to do it with someone that you care
about and stuff with that so that's why
I love to do it with him but
realistically speaking it's not going to
happen anytime soon because we're both
college students the next question is
will you ever do a meet-and-greet in
Charlotte and I would rule up two new
one I don't know how many of you guys
was there so if you guys weren't there
and wanted me in Greece
let me know and wherever you are glid
comment down below so I can know where
most of you live so from ever in that
area the next question is if you can
pick Italy Australia or Hawaii where
would you live for five years yes I love
your videos your session inspiration
thank you so much I love you so much and
the common inspiration is crazy but this
one's good I was actually genuinely
struggled to think about because the
thing is Australia and Hawaii
speak the language Hawaii is in the US
which I'm familiar with and familiar
with a law familiar with everything like
it the way it works you know and Italy I
don't speak Italian but it's so
beautiful if I have to pick four
actually criminally living it might be
Hawaii or Australia just because the
whole language thing but they're both so
far away from everything else like Italy
is in Europe it's close to other
countries it's such a tough decision
I don't know but Hawaii no come on Mikey
how can you say no to that what colleges
did you apply to other than MCC I love
you can you do a meet-up in Raleigh or
Durham again I would love to do a
meet-up and roll your Durham if you guys
are from there let me know but the
elements one by two I've said this
before but I don't know like you
laughing my headset it other school I
went to or NC State University of Miami
which is in Florida
Clemson and Virginia Tech and I was
between Clemson and NC State nose really
torn by that decision after you graduate
where would you like to live so this is
something that I like thinking about
every single day so I always want to
live in New York City that is no one's
kind of in like my dream of mine since I
was really little I love born in New
York every time I'm there feels like
home I love the city live I've been
there too many times to help probably
over 20 times I visit in New York so New
York is slick where my heart is but
realistically speaking with the cobweb
account with the opportunities I have
and also the fact that I love the city
it would be locked man to work I know
I'm the most cliche youtuber ever if I
do move there but that would be
something that I would love to do look
I'm visiting LA and August and I'm
really excited see it and
I've been there before but I don't know
I feel and realistically I might be
going to LA but like my heart is in New
York but I would also be so stoked to
move to LA to so I really don't know
what was the last picture you took with
your phone and greeting from Germany by
the way hello and of simple you injure
me and you watch my videos I love to
take questions so I'm going to look the
last photo I took off myself on my phone
besides all the screenshots from you
guys it was actually two pictures that I
posted on Instagram it was like a bikini
picture of me yes go follow me on
Instagram a lot of choices on my phone
and if you look I have like 20 of the
same picture because you know you have
to take a million before you get the
right one
what are your favorite spots in Miami
when you go visit what are the best
restaurants places to shop for take nice
photos would you ever consider doing a
meet-up here in South Florida again I am
flattered that so many of you want me to
do a meet-up because now I really want
to do meetups I've never done one of
those before but my favorite things in
Miami Miami is my second home if you
guys don't know I was born and raised in
a little suburb outside of Fort
Lauderdale so close enough to Miami and
we have a place down here now that I
come to all the time and my favorite is
to go our number one half nephew a suit
I will have Cuban food for every single
meal I could because I miss it so much
and ethical niches the other favorite
things to do is South Beach is really
fun but again I'm not really rich in the
South Beach area that often but it is a
good beach it's just a losing to be
crowded I really like Wynwood Walls cook
good if you're here for the first time
ever and you just want to get through
that Instagram picture that have with
all the pretty walls have a hundred
percent feed it on Instagram another
nice part of Miami Aventura Mall hello
like biggest mall ever I love it I'm
trying to think of other no it's like a
home to me now so it's basically my home
so I don't even know what site go to the
beach and stuff guys device how to get
guys to notice you how to get a
conversation going and would love a
video on this also I would love to do a
whole video on this and bring my guy
friends along on it I think that would
be a really fun trip yet to do but my
favorite or my space or losing my best
tip to you guys to talk to boys is to
let
and just come naturally like it
shouldn't you should have to force
yourself to talk to guy if there's a guy
make you do because life and you want to
talk then ask your friends that they
know and maybe but it's conscious they
would go up to him if it's out like this
class or something and be like hey I'm
asking about homework I don't know I and
this give us our own lane but I
literally picked off two guys in two
like 11th grade offense school so I
don't I was proud I was one of these
questions like how do I talk to guys and
no idea so my best advice is just to
become Francis emperors don't be scared
there few men witches like us but just
become president before you're really
speaking a relationship I guess and also
on other piece of advice there's s AG of
texting a knife you're constantly
texting him first I know guys say that
they like when girls like Persinger
which is totally fine me I definitely am
not going to like not transferring if I
want to talk to someone I'll protect
them but if they're not responding to
you just stop and my biggest advice for
that is like you're typing and I good
for you
go girl like I highly recommend making
the first like texting move again if
you're really really like wanting to
protect you but if they don't respond
that I would select never took some get
until they text you I don't know have
like amazing advice but me personally I
look alright like they already
documented so I want to talk about now
is their chance I'm done doing the work
basically is my move for that in the
same for guys if you guys are watching
this is when you're texting those are
all she does is talk to you I would show
them and not technically when was your
first kiss and what was your first kiss
love you now you use a lunch I love you
too my first kiss was in like I said I
didn't talk to guys until 11th grade so
my first kiss was a little later in the
game and it's going into eleventh grade
of high school and it was really awkward
it was not good I have liked this guy
for a while and we kissed in his car
outside of like some shopping center I
don't even know it was really awkward
though because I was so nervous and that
ya know it was just like not a good not
a good first guess but I mean if
anyone's first gift guide me now are you
going to are you going on summer
vacation if so where I love you like I
said in this video yesterday I'm going
on vacation I'm currently on some
rotation right now and so say guys wanna
follow my vlog Channel please feel free
to follow that I am going to start
blogging around the amplification now
I'm going back step bikini pics that I
have to go to asking questions on and
women try to answer as many as I can I
could answer all crap chat ones but I'm
so far I'm going to try to answer as
many of these as I can that's why I'm
kind of going to go really fast fine
answering Katie photo 15 act what is the
one thing you like most about being
college student
so definitely mounts out it is the
freedom even when I'm home for the
summer or for short little break I'm
like oh my gosh I can't wait to go back
just so I can have the freedom again I
love my family and I miss them
but it is different because
understandably your family's like hey
where you going why don't you tell me
like you've chopped up all my rolls you
still go by our schedule now that you're
home and look in college of some time
you said I like everything is about me
like what do I want to do when do I want
to do this you know it's like I'm not
really being told what to do constantly
so I definitely love the freedom are
eating ask a couple questions but one of
them is what is your favorite movie of
the year
so far and I actually never go to movie
theatres but I did recently to see
Wonder Woman and that between my mind I
love that movie so much if you just have
not seen it I highly suggest it as an
amazing message it's just an amazing
movie overall and gal gadot or gal gadot
i don't know how to think her name is
like hundred-percent my girl crush you
watch that movie single long-standing
ally woods ooh I'm hoping think writer
asked I'm really good at math and I love
math what and want to go to college is
something that has a lot of it what
majors where you guys meant do that so
for a fad majors or or for someone that
loves math there's a math major there is
engineering which is highly focused and
math it's also highly go to science we
kind of have to love both of them and
then they
is accounting accounting basically all
numbers so if you want to do that or
econ is a lot of math too
so recommend any of those majors may
think for you and you really love that
Spicer clear skies sir what was the
hardest classes in college did you ever
have to retake a class if so how did you
feel and having failed what's the more
people advice you could give to a fellow
engineering student so so one of my
videos I had mentioned that C's get
degrees and I got so much hate in the
comments for that and I was just like ah
raised by people like you guys just
don't understand what I was trying to
say a lot of times thank you have C's
for every single class and that's great
obviously it strive to get an A but you
get to see in your life don't freak out
it's not the end of the world I'd really
wanted to a video on moving cake
comments because my engineering videos
got a ton of those and all of them
problem older males wonder why yeah I
would say I definitely have to retake
one class imma take physics the first
one and that was my freshman year
college I got a c-minus and I needed a C
so it technically didn't fail but I
didn't get the required for my like
major I really was upset about that cuz
I have studied so hard and all of a
sudden I was like grapes look literally
I might as well not have studied it not
wasting my time we must retake you
anyway but then I realize it's not a
really smart way to symptomatic so when
I retook it is so much easier for me I
didn't study as much and honestly I
learned that you need to try your best
even if you fail which try your best in
everything that you do in life because
that is just going to set you up for a
greater work ethic even if you're not
the smartest person ever if you try
understood work ethic
think ups are going to be a good just
life skill in general people will see
that I think you said people some people
are like oh yeah like I could have half
the class since I've tried it's like
alright well look you didn't try so you
failed I don't know what I was not
supposed to be impressive like I'm
really smart if I try well no one's
going to see that your support if you
don't try so he can people say that like
good for you for being natural smart
even though no one can tell and you're
not
going to do well in life and it was
really like to do reactions any comments
I think they'd be really funny because
the ones I guess they're good ones LSB
say ask what is your faith and belief so
who knows you guys I don't know I try to
kind of say in my videos but I am a
Christian and I really believe that I
can just love Jesus with all your heart
and you just read the Bible and I use
that kind of like what I should follow
in life not really a set of rules more
of a relationship with Jeter that's what
I believe kids let me show you a video
on that I certainly can but yeah that's
my faith in it a one-sentence nutshell
marry am coaster I really away from that
right I'm so sorry I recognized your
name because you were always like
chatting on Twitter and stuff but she
asks how do you handle insecurity and
low self-esteem so this can be the last
question that I answer but I would love
to a whole day on this I've already
actually done couple of these I'm going
to see them so we can't but I am a human
being I get insecure even though I put
myself on the internet and it's like
number one way to feel insecure to put
yourself on the Internet I the way I
deal with it now I don't really care
when I get hate comments I'm like okay
there's literally nothing better to do
with their lives okay I don't want that
he commented and just like all right
whatever I'm gonna brush it off and when
you feel too insecure to sit in your
life in general like if a guy doesn't
like you or like if you feel like you're
lonely or anything like that the way I
deal with it I can kind of going back to
my face and belief I always pray about
it and read my Bible when I'm kind of
feeling lonely I agree but I tend to
read my Bible every day but especially
in like times like that when you kind of
are feeling insecure not confident in
yourself eschewing to go to the word and
to what makes you realize like hey
actually I am really the daughter of the
creator of the universe I think that's
something that I should be confident in
myself for so thanks my darling I try to
like pray about it and just remember my
values when it comes to I'm feeling
insecure another thing I hope when
feeling of caring feel unconfident is
knowing that no one's life is perfect
everyone feels this way no matter how
perfect other people's lives are on
screen or on Instagram on Twitter or
snapchat or on anything no one is going
to put their worst moment even on people
I just learned this because I'm like oh
grandma
on a spring stuff I don't have one but I
really see that my little travel and her
life wasn't it bad
even that like people are like oh it's
pretty clear your real life on there
people are still about a foot on I'm
sorry but understand how open you are no
one is gonna put their worst of themself
on the internet and any form like if I
have litter inserted a crying on the
floor because of how insecure I feel how
uncommon that I feel how ugly I feel I'm
not about to blog about I'm not about to
put that on the Internet like I don't
care how real or genuine and open I am
with my followers that people don't put
that on there because that is something
that you can just feel internally and
you don't want the world to know no
matter how open you are so I really
think that's important in a lot of
people look at social media now as like
blurring the lines between back there
life I'm like to flip a person on an
iPhone screen but that's not it there's
so much more that you guys don't know
about me there's so much more I could be
doing this videos too and telling you
about this but if you guys still are not
going away meet this moment so I think
that's also important to understand
along every literally opportunity a bill
to play some time and now there is no
reason to feel that way because you are
wonderful and works easily a wonderful
name where my favorite bible verses but
uh because that helps in any way if you
guys want me to do a cool huge video
element let me know I love doing advice
videos but I drilled it all the
questions that I guess sir thank you so
much for answering or for asking all
these questions and I love talking you
guys so thank you and I will see you
guys in my next video
sure why I said that alright bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
