I'd love to meet you and just kind of

thank you guys so much I think that's
absolutely crazy and whenever I kind of
grow in subscribers at a more rapid pace
I like doing Q&amp;amp;A is or get to know me
things when I hit 50 I did a 50 facts
about me so you guys can definitely
check that out too but today I'm doing a
Q&amp;amp;A and I put this on my snapchat so if
guys don't follow me on snapchat please
do I always alternate between snapchat
and Instagram because that's where I get
the most interaction I never really use
Twitter but like you want to follow me
on there you totally can but yeah I
really use snapchat and Instagram for my
Q&amp;amp;A is and this is my first snapchat Q&amp;amp;A
and I got a lot a lot of responses so
I'm so happy about that and I am just
going to jump right into the questions I
have them on my phone and again if you
guys are new here let me know and if
this is actually your first time seeing
me and you're not subscribed please be
sure to subscribe I would love it if you
guys would stick around and then leave a
comment but yeah it's just it's exciting
it's like a good day when like more
people are coming in and join it it's a
good day so thank you thanks so much
first question it is kind of a random
one and it's from Ariana I'm not gonna
say last names because I don't know if
people want me to share like their
snapchat stuff because I feel like that
is more like private but Ariana asked if
I have ever heard of Arizona State and
if so would I go there that's a pretty
random question I definitely have heard
of it I think it's a pretty popular
school I feel like most people have
heard of it I think Arizona would be a
cool place to go but I honestly don't
know anything about it so I would
definitely see that to see if I would
actually go the next question is did it
your nose piercing hurt and a when did
you got it done okay so if you guys
don't know I have my nose pierced I have
like a little tiny stud you can bear
see it i- piercing experience I actually
showed it a vlog I wasn't allowed to
vlog me getting it done I don't know why
they didn't allow cameras down there we
like pulled it out and the guy was like
no put it away but I got her on in
Greenwich Village in New York I was
there one day you know what's kind of
like you know what I kind of want to get
my nose pierced and we just walked in
and did it I didn't have any plan to get
it pierced but I always liked that so
yeah that's kinda what happened I didn't
ask my parents or anything and they were
kind of upset about that cuz they found
out like a month later when I sent them
a picture of my face and they're like
what's in your nose different her it
feels like a little pinch and that's it
I had one eye that just like cried and
then the other one it was totally fine
um and then it kind of just felt like a
little sore for the next hour but it
didn't hurt like it wasn't like a oh my
god like this hurts so much pain the guy
was so cool I think it's called like
West Village tattoos or something like
that I'm gonna have amazing reviews on
Yelp if you're gonna get anything
pierced check Yelp don't go to a random
sketchy place like please don't those
things can get infected and it could be
really bad I also know a lot of people
get their nose piercing infected and
they get like a little bubble over it I
never did I really took great care of it
like made sure to wash it every day and
every day but yeah it didn't hurt at all
I really like it I really kind of want
to get like the hoop but you can either
keep this one in for a long time before
you can switch it out for the hoop
because the hoop gets more easily
infected next question from Sarah is how
to get over someone that you are never
with so this question is kind of hard
because they definitely have been there
in the past especially in high school
and how to get over something that you
were never with I feel like it's the
same as going through a breakup if you
just treat it as you're going through a
breakup I feel like you might like
instead of looking like how do I get
over summer I was never with kind of
treat it like you know what this part of
your life is over now as sad as that is
but stop looking at their Instagram stop
looking at their Twitter their Twitter
likes whose what pictures they've liked
on Instagram their followers all that
stuff I know girls do and boys too but
yeah don't do that that will drive you
insane and especially since you work
with them you might think like oh
they're probably doing what they did to
me too like a million other people or
they're probably talking to a lot of
other girls don't think about that
because it will
we hurt you and it might be true and if
it is it will only hurt so my biggest
advice is to not stalk them on social
media don't talk to them if I feel like
constant communication even if you were
friends I know it's hard because you
might have like like your best guy
friend and then you realize she doesn't
like you and you're trying to get over
that but for that time being I think you
need to take care of yourself and you
need to stop talking to them for a
little bit or at least ease off on it
because you're never gonna get over
someone if you're always talking to them
and if you always see them and I just
feel like that's never going to work
like no matter what breakup or not like
it's just not gonna work you're not
gonna get over the person so that is my
advice it really does suck I would love
to do a whole kind of video on
relationship advice so if you guys are
interested in that let me know I have a
lot of relationship videos too so you
guys can see those also Steph asked how
do you see yourself in five to ten years
so I guess where do I see myself in five
to ten years and I will be like almost
26 in five years and almost 31 in ten
years which is insane
oh well it's got a crazy it's really
crazy because I have no idea where I see
myself I'm hoping to be married by the
time I'm 26 I know that kind of sounds
like that's so young but I am currently
in a relationship and I don't know I
feel like I can definitely see myself
being married at that age and same with
31 obviously I hope to be stay married
and if I'm not married by 26 I hope to
be married by 31 I hope to have kids by
the age of 31 maybe one or two by then I
don't know I kind of want to have like
an average-sized family like three to
four kids average too large sized family
that's just how I grew up so I want that
I feel like everyone kind of wants how
they grew up see myself like that I know
this questions more pertaining to
probably like jobs job wise I have no
idea I hope to be still be doing YouTube
I hope that YouTube keeps me around this
long I have no idea how long YouTube
will last but if it could last that long
that would be amazing so I'm hoping that
it could if not something else and maybe
in the media world or just marketing or
being something in a creative field for
though everything I listed off had
nothing to do with engineering but if
being honest in the future I don't
really want to work for an engineering
company at all so that's probably my
dream job working for like marketing or
doing something with media management or
anything more creative because again
like I said YouTube is my passion
and I would love to kind of incorporate
that into something for my job someone
asked what is my favorite thing about NC
State I go to NC State by the way and my
favorite thing is probably our football
games and the fact that we are in a big
city I live in Raleigh North Carolina
because that's where NC State is and I
really like it because it is a big city
and it's not like the middle of nowhere
like it's not just like a college town
I'm very much a person that like
location it's everything
so yeah favorite song of all time I
don't have a favorite song of all time
like I don't know but at the moment I am
absolutely loving Keiko and Selena's new
song I know I couldn't have said a more
basic answer but like it's so good what
are some of your favorite online stores
I love Windsor I love three people I
love urban yeah those are like probably
my top three aspect of Fitness life
helps you burn slash get rid of the most
fat like diet or cardio the main factor
I love you by the way I love you too and
if you guys don't know I have a fitness
video that's kind of gaining popularity
I think that's where a lot of new people
are coming from so if you want to watch
that totally can I think the main part
of fitness that helps you burn fat is
definitely I mean cardio is gonna help
you burn fat but like your diet is gonna
help you keep it off wonder how many
times you go to the gym if you still eat
really really poorly and eat things that
are high in fat and high in calories
you're not gonna lose weight so I think
it's kind of a hand-in-hand but if you
want to like have a flat stomach and
stuff I think that is mainly diet how do
you seek get yourself organized with
Yuni tasks workouts friends especially
unis and work so by using unis I'm
assuming you're from Europe which by the
way I'm going to gear up next week and
I'm gonna blog and if you guys have any
recommendations let me know I'm going to
Paris Amsterdam and London and a nice
I'm so excited but if you guys have any
recommendations please let me know in
the comments and anyway sidetrack it now
back to this question staying organized
I've made kind of like it's a few videos
on this but I might make another one I'm
gonna do a video on how I take notes on
my iPad
we need to upload that last week but
just like didn't happen so I'm gonna
upload that don't worry how I say
organize though is just by writing
everything down and making a schedule I
know I need a really plan my days like
two three days in advance and that's
just like the best thing I can say like
prioritizing school but like also making
sure I have time for YouTube it's really
like I might take you guys in a day of
my life and like just see how I like God
how my day because it's a lot it's
really hard I actually like don't have
any free time at all like what are your
favorite series on Netflix I absolutely
love Netflix I like and always watching
Netflix I feel bad cuz they don't even
watching YouTube that often like I'm
always watching Netflix I currently
right now I'm watching friends I'm on
season 10 it is the funniest show ever
and I'm like don't know what I'm gonna
do when it ends like I'm like
emotionally attached to every single
character but yeah I'm watching that
right now
best show and I'm also watching scandal
and I really really AM into scandal -
it's really good tips for how to grow on
YouTube so this I can make a whole video
on and I actually do have a video on
that so if you guys want to answer see
an answer that I will have that where
you can click but yeah basically
everything is there because that cannot
be answered in like a 1 second thing but
if I could take one thing away from a
whole video on that it would stay be
consistent consistency is a hundred
percent key don't post every once a
month you're never gonna gain
subscribers and just post whatever like
even if you don't think it's great just
have your content out there for people
to see not everything needs to be
perfect because chances are nothing will
ever be perfect I know that sounds bad
but you know just post the content that
you have just to get people to watch it
and then as you go along you will get
better you're not gonna get better if
you just have ideas in your head and
never actually throw them out there so
that is my number one tip um but that is
it for this video that is all the
questions I got or chose to answer and I
hope you guys enjoyed this if you guys
want to be a participating in the next
Q&amp;amp;A
follow me on Instagram snapchat and
Twitter and which social media you guys
prefer to a dhruv Q&amp;amp;A zon so if that's
twitter let me know but I feel like I
don't get that
interaction on Twitter so it's mainly
snapchat and Instagram but yeah also
leave recommendations for the since that
I should go I'm so excited I'm leaving
in a few days and I will definitely be
daily vlogging there and I have so many
videos coming out you guys I'm so
excited for this next month like I just
got done with midterms so like hell week
