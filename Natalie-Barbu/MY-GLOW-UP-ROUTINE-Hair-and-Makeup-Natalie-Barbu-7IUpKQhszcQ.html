showing you guys how I transform my face
and my hair and just this whole general
not looking too good appearance - photo
shoot ready - picture ready - just look
in way better than this
I am very sick right now last night was
Halloween and I didn't go out and it's
my senior year and it's just because I
like episode threw out I woke up every
30 minutes last night it was just a bad
night for me hanging out with my friend
Laura and we're doing like this photo
shoot and I I needed to get together so
I figured this would be a perfect
opportunity to do a glow up video if you
guys are new to my channel please be
sure to subscribe I would love it if you
guys could join the fam we're gonna be
called the Barbie dolls from now on
because they love that name if you guys
are new here also comment down below how
you guys found my channel or if you're
also a returning subscriber just let me
know how you found my channel I would
love to know that I'm always super super
curious but without further ado let's
get into the first I'm gonna start off
with this Laura Mercier radiance primer
to make sure that you have like a good
base I would definitely recommend
starting with a primer for your
foundation and I like the radiance one
because it makes you already look very
like glowy and that already makes you
look more alive so I just put it all
over my face I really like the Laura
Mercier ones because they're more like
moisturizers they're not a silicone II
as it is fall and the weather is
starting to get colder I am going to go
in with my strobe cream and I'm gonna be
applying it on the high points of my
face this is just gonna go underneath my
foundation and again I want my highlight
to be on point because even though I
feel disgusting I still want to look
good
now that we have all of that set on our
face now we are going to go in with the
foundation I am using Rihanna's
foundation fancy I have been loving this
product so much and I apply it with a
Beauty Blender and I apply it all over
my face when you want to blow up you
definitely want to have more of a high
coverage foundation I just think that
it's going to be like you're gonna cover
all of your dark circles and dark spots
and acne scar isn't anything that you
want to cover so this one is probably my
most full coverage because I don't ever
wear like super heavy foundation but you
guys can just tell it's already covering
up and making my skin tone so much more
even so this is a great foundation I
actually did a whole video on it if you
guys want to see that and now after I
have my foundation you can tell it's
already starting to look so much better
I'm gonna go in with my concealer so I
use a Laura Mercier's concealer this is
the secret concealer and I really really
like it I just apply it with a little
tiny concealer brush and that I got at
Sephora I dip it in the product and I
put it underneath my eyes this is
definitely gonna brighten it and because
I haven't really gotten any sleep this
is gonna cover all of my dark spots and
under-eye circles so this is a concealer
it is really really great I love it it's
definitely been my favorite and it's
more heavy duty
but this concealer I actually start
blending at with my ring finger and
because the warmth of your hand is gonna
make it blend more easily and make it
kind of like melt into your skin and
then after I do that I go with my Beauty
Blender to kind of press it into my skin
and to make it look more flawless but I
like that the warmth of your finger
really really melts it in and I feel
like it gives it a better finish ready
you can tell I'm starting to look so
much better I absolutely love this
concealer it's by far my favorite one so
if you guys need a heavy-duty concealer
or just one that blends so effortlessly
into your skin that is definitely my
favorite hand sound and then I am going
in with the Laura Mercier translucent
powder this is definitely one of my
favorites as well I think Laura Mercier
has great products and tapping it
underneath my eyes to bake my concealer
I am still into the baking phase I
absolutely love it I think it makes your
makeup stay on all day long
start with the eyes I'm going to start
priming them I just used the primer
potion or literally any primer I can
find I need to buy a new one because
this is like all out and I think I've
had it for me like for years so this is
just what I really found in my drawer
for my eyebrows I always start with the
eyebrows my eyebrows are so bad right
now you guys so please no mean comments
in the comment section because I know
that they're bad I need to get them done
but we're gonna work with what we have
because this is a glow up so you want to
truly love get your eyebrows done but if
not got to work with what you have
if you guys can see the difference this
one is so much better you guys oh my
gosh all right now time for this one and
X I'm going to work on the eye shadow as
for eyes I always start with a blending
color I feel like that's the best way to
start your eye shadow especially if you
don't really know what look you're going
for so I'm gonna start off with the
lightest color and just start blending
it onto my lid and crease and this will
be a good transition color for no matter
what look I'm doing I'm going to use
more of a orange shade orange brown
shade actually and I'll be doing that
and putting that in my crease really
really gently so that it's not too
overpowering and then with the lighter
color I am going to blend it out some
more next I'm going to apply a gold
shimmery color and I'm going to put that
all over my lid this is gonna make your
eyes pop and that is going to make your
eyes look a lot brighter and more alive
which definitely I need
and then I'm gonna go in with another
orange shade and kind of just put it on
the outside of my crease and this is
only going to give it more dimension
because that is what I'm going for but
it doesn't really add much to the color
it just gives it more of a bomb bright
effect to have it blend more I'm going
to apply that color that I just applied
in the outer portion to the outer part
of my lid and with the lighter color
again I'm going to blend everything out
asked for eyeliner I am just going to
take a black pencil eyeliner and rim it
the top and bottom of my lid this is
going to give it more of an effortless
look that is what I'm going for instead
of a harsh black line with liquid
eyeliner and next I am just going to
curl my lashes and apply mascara to make
my eyes look definitely more ride in a
week
the baking has been sets for a very long
time so I'm just gonna wipe it off with
a brush make sure you get everything cuz
you don't want any white powder on your
face especially for photos because that
will make it look really really bad I am
going to be applying my favorite bronzer
ever which is the hoola by benefit
bronzer and when you are this tired like
me you want to make sure contouring is
your friend so I'm just going to start
right here and do a straight line on
back and then whatever is left on your
brush I will take it and I'll blend it
into my hairline and with this obviously
you want to blend you don't want just
two straight lines so I will begin by
circling my brush and blending it out
and then once you're done with the
contour with the bronzer I am going to
add highlighter on to the tops of my
cheekbones and of course as you guys
know this is the whole look that we're
going for I also tried making everything
a little uniform like the eyes are a
little orange the bronzer kind of
matches the eyes and then now I'm gonna
go in with a gold highlighter this one
is from Laura Mercier and it's a super
pretty gold color it broke so I can
barely show it to you guys but there it
is and I am just going to be applying a
fan brush and putting this on the tops
of my cheekbones and after that I will
be applying my favorite blush which is a
cult favorite of mine I've been using
this I think since like freshman year of
high school the NARS orgasm blush it is
the best universal blush and it makes
you look so healthy and I'll be applying
that on the apples of my cheek as for
lips I am first going to be applying a
buxom z' lip plumper and this is also
works as a chapstick so I'm going to be
applying that because whenever I get
sick or whenever I'm tired or anything
the weather's changing my lips get super
chapped so I'm gonna start with this
chapstick and because like I said my
lips get chapped I'm gonna avoid a
liquid lipstick because that's just
gonna dry your lips out and make you
look worse so I'm just applying this lip
gloss from benefit
as for the hair my favorite thing to do
when it looks bad is just to flip it to
an opposite side so my hair is normally
in the middle so I'm just flipping it to
the side and then I will begin to curl
or straighten it and this will give it
volume because you're changing the part
and then if you curl or straighten it it
just looks so much better and here we
are
so after eivin's on curling my hair and
parting it and I just do a messy waves
so it looks effortless but it was not
effortless this is the final look it is
my below up routine so if I need to get
to like look good even though I'm not
looking good that day this is what I do
every time so I hope that you guys enjoy
it let me see tweet me guys your glow up
routines and if you guys have any funny
ones I would love to see them so please

Instagram if you guys do that super
random but just so you know thank you so
