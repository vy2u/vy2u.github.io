and today I am filming it this video for
you guys very very last minute my video
for yesterday just all the footage got
deleted so for those of you who are new
here I host videos every Tuesdays and
Fridays normally so be sure to subscribe
it to watch those and if you guys like
this video I'm sure that you'll like all
my other videos so hit subscribe and
thumbs this video up and if I'm talking
funny it's cuz I have it the worst like
cut in my mouth and this side of my face
is a little swollen and I have kind of
like a lisp from it so anything that's
how Annie at home remedies to fix it
because it's literally killing me then
let me know in the comments below
I've tried salt water already so
anything other than that I just wanted
to film a video about high school
because I feel like I talk so much about
college on this channel I am a senior in
college so it is appropriate and fitting
that I talk about college but I feel
like I haven't done any videos about
high school may also have a lot of
people that are like juniors and seniors
in high school watching me so comment
down below if you guys aren't in high
school I would love it to know so I'm
gonna kind of do it year by year and
just tell you guys my high school
experience I was watching a video of a
high school experience the other day
which prompted me and like gave me the
idea to do one of these and I just was
like reminiscing on my high school days
and I was like I wanna film a video like
this I feel like I have never filmed one
like this overall I would say I ranked
high school like a 7 out of 10 like I
was one of those people who really
really liked it like I didn't I wasn't
like in love with high school I don't
wish I was back in high school I do
think college is better in my opinion
but I did really enjoy it I wasn't one
of those people that hated high school
so I want to hear your guys's ratings
her high school so if it was a 7 out of
10 10 out of 10
2
I want to know because it's one of those
things I feel like we're people like
really really love it or they really
really hate it and they're like I cannot
wait to get the heck out of here like
this is the worst four years of my life
so each year was so significantly
different for me none of them were the
same honestly I don't remember much
about freshman year of high school
I really really really don't as much as
I could like try to wrack my brain I
just like don't remember no I do
remember that I had gone into it kind of
with like my best friend her middle
school so we me and this girl were like
inseparable we were just like best
friends from middle school and freshman
year was the year that we drifted apart
and that we kind of I don't really think
we had any drama of her say I just think
we drifted apart and that really happens
a lot so people that your friends look
like a freshman year or in middle school
that you're going into high school with
nine out of ten times from what I've
seen you're not friends with them once
you're like graduating high school I
feel like that's kind of hell it was so
no hard feelings they're what gave me
the most anxiety in high school was
lunch and that sounds so stupid now
looking back at it but I was so I had so
much anxiety about where I was gonna sit
and I remember a freshman year I'm
pretty sure I had lunch with like all
the freshmen except like some of my
friends weren't in it so it was kind of
like one of those of us like split and I
just like freaked out I was like I don't
know where to sit like what are we gonna
do look I don't want I'm so confused and
or not so complete which is so stressed
I was like what if like I have to get
there first but then I don't want to get
there first because if I sit down and
then they don't follow me to sit down
then that's really awkward because I'm
just sitting by myself so I have to kind
of get there in the middle so like it's
not completely full and I remember I got
there when it was full and I was just
like uh uh that was it can I stay here
and they're like oh like it's full sorry
and I was like okay just so I'm that
stuck with me for all four years I was
always had the most anxiety about lunch
and like towards the under freshman year
I started hanging out with the
girlfriends that I'm like super close to
now so we kind of had like a little
group starting at the end of freshman
year kind of like summer going into
summer here so yeah besides that I
really don't remember anything
freshman year of high school like maybe
for good reason I don't know I want to
insert photos of myself in every single
year so here it's a beautiful photo of
me from freshman year I feel like I look
like I literally think I weighed like 90
pounds like I was so skinny then and I
was just like a stick but I feel like
overall I kind of like look to the same
throughout high school
so for sophomore year is when I start
remembering things and when I start
having like significant I don't know
people in my life I guess I was like the
first year I actually had guy friends
which is so sad to say but I really like
did not hang out with guys in middle
school whatsoever I just like was I was
really scared to talk to boys I was
super insecure back then I feel like
I've grown so much in a good way but I
was just like so insecure back then and
so like I don't know very timid look I
didn't want to talk to boys because I
was like oh they're gonna think of ugly
so I don't even want to talk to them you
know it was just like one of those
things so here's a lovely picture of me
from sophomore years so you guys can get
have the image in your head while I'm
telling these stories I started talking
about if you're automatically that is
when I started having guy friends and
like having pretty good guy friends what
I started naturally liking one of them
and I think it's just because looking
back I'm like I think it's because I
never had really like talked to boys
before and like never had guy friends
that like when I did I was just
automatically like oh my gosh like I
like them like I think that they're cute
I like it but they're funny I get along
with that look I like them so I had
liked one of the guys and never in my
life would I ever say it like would I
ever speak that out loud I remember we
would always hang out and stuff and I
think he had liked one of my best
friends and I had known that with one of
the other girls in our group and he
liked her so I was like really sad
because I was like oh my gosh like
like me you know like internalizing you
know it was like now look I'm not gonna
do anything about it like a could barely
even like talk to guys six months ago
look I'm not gonna ruin it you know just
sadly like watch him like her and I was
like I think it was like that person I
he you talked to a lot because I think
we had like up some classes together so
he would talk to me about her and be
like oh do you think she likes me like
can you like give her my number can I
have her number whatever and sophomore
year was good I had my friends we have
like a solid solid fatty group and I was
really really really fun so we hung out
a lot so towards the end of the
year we started hanging out a lot more
and all the girls started hanging out
more we just have our friend group so
you know when you have a girlfriend
you're gonna everyone knows like oh
that's them like they hang out together
all the time like that's kind of how we
were and also throughout all of this I
would never say that I was popular by
any means especially sophomore year I do
not think I was like popular whatsoever
sophomore year in January or March I
think it was the March issue of
Seventeen magazine you know sophomore
year is when I was in it so for those of
you guys who don't know I was in part of
the 17 Style Council which meant that I
was in like a few of 17s issues which
was so amazing so I would send my
pictures and they would put them in
their magazine in March I had like a
full-page spread on Seventeen magazine
they flew me to New York a few times
that year to do photo shoots with them
so that was kind of like when I
announced that like this was on
Instagram was starting and I had posted
that like on Instagram and Facebook like
I wouldn't say I became more popular but
more people knew me I was like oh that's
the girl in Seventeen magazine you know
like that's so cool so then that's
sophomore year had fun had my friend
group kind of solidified that and then
junior year so between my sophomore and
junior year I had my first kiss so I
think I had that kind of late for
everyone like most of my friends had had
their first kiss by then but again you
guys could expect that I didn't and I
remember someone one time like asked me
when my first kiss was and I think I
lied and I was like it was like
I'd like the beach one summer like in
like sounds great who cares about that
like literally who cares but that
happened with that one person that I
liked and then junior year me and that
one guy like Hana started talking
because he had like him and that one
girl like she didn't like him whatever
like and she was my friend and whatever
drama drama drama junior year I started
talking to him and I think when I was in
high school I don't know if people say
this anymore
but like I was in high school everyone
was talking and it was like it wasn't
dating it wasn't like being single I was
like oh yeah they're talking like oh are
you and that guy talking like that was
just like what everyone said so I don't
know if do people still use that I don't
know though me and him were talking and
we weren't officially dating or anything
but we like basically we're like we
would like go on dates and like he would
hang out at my house and I would go to
his house and blah blah junior year
though was like really really bad year
for me I made a whole video on me like
reading my journal from junior year if
you guys want to see that it was like 2
years ago but it was just like very
depressing I was just like a very very
bad place junior year me and him when we
stopped talking it was like a really
really nasty kind of like a nasty
breakup so he started becoming really
really mean to me and he was just
calling me like really mean names like
he would literally be like Natalie
you're such a bitch like I like never
liked you like you're the worst person
whatever just like really really mean
names and for someone who already was so
insecure hearing that I'm someone that
you liked and then you thought that they
liked you like really hurt you know I
was really affected by that obviously I
feel like anyone kind of would
especially in that state and when I look
back I think like that whole entire
situation that had happened like if that
happened to me now what I'm about to
tell you guys and stuff like if all this
like drama and stupid stuff happen now I
wouldn't really be a
by it because I'm just like so much more
mature and so what am i confident in
myself but like back then I couldn't
really handle it
and like he would tell me how he started
like talking and dating actually that
one like one of my friends and so that
was drama because I was like really mad
at both of them and whatever and now
looking back look I don't care about
that at all like oh who are you guys
like whatever you know it's look I don't
care about that in that moment I was
just like so hurt and like so like how
could you say all these things to me
like how could you treat me like such
garbage um
and I remember II was like since we were
such a friend group like we were all
friends like I definitely split the
friend group into so a lot of my
girlfriends kind of like chose sides
like Oh her side or Natalie's side
because we were all friends and so its
split our fingers down the middle
basically and like people started
picking sides and people would start
like lying to each other like one of my
friends had like a party at her house
and literally in the text message was
like oh but don't tell Natalie and like
random people were invited like all my
friends were invited like girls guys
everyone and like no one invited me
because of just this whole mess that was
happening look so excited like it was
like crying and like really really upset
and like this was when like I had good
guy friends too but they were that guy's
guy friends so they like chose his side
but some of them were like listen
Natalie like don't let it get to you
like he's just a jerk whatever you know
no way trying to comfort me itself which
it did help but like it was just it was
such a mess I would like he would just
tell me like the most awful things and
so I was just so so hurt by it and like
kind of trying to flaunt the
relationship to my face like oh look
like I just used you to get to her like
haha like literally words that came out
of his mouth like that was it
I had like confided in him and a lot of
secrets of mine and like things I just
didn't want people knowing and he have
like told everyone and people it came
back to me and they were like oh my gosh
you did that you weren't said that or
whatever it was just awful I literally
remember crying myself to sleep I'm not
kidding every day for a semester of
freshman year like every single day that
was like a really really low point in my
life
very very very depressed like I was I
think I actually if I went to a doctor
which I should have I think I would have
been diagnosed with depression like I
was just like not in a good state of
mind at all it was just an awful year
and like for being an insecure person my
self-esteem had dropped even more and so
it's just awful here it is here's a
picture of me junior year sad little
Natalie
so then senior year came around and I
remember that summer I had traveled all
summer I was in Miami for like three
weeks I went to uni like California I
went to letter I just like traveled all
summer long like I was gone the entire
summer like I did not hang out with my
friends at all which I think was so good
for me because I was away from that from
all of that and like people forgot about
me and I like forgot about them you know
so it was just like a good break and the
girlfriends that I had had we kind of
all like mended things and like some of
my girlfriends still like were really
close to me and but we were close to out
at all but you know we kind of like I
had like my core girlfriends now and
they started hanging out with a new
group of guys so they kind of like
ditched those old guys because I think
they realized they were like such jerks
and so they started hanging out with
like a new group of guys and this new
group of guys is who actually was in my
like core high school friend group so
senior year of high school I started
hanging out with them because when I got
back they were just like oh do you know
like so and so and so and so and
actually the boyfriend today I call and
he was in that friend group so he was
like a part of that friend group my
senior year and so I didn't really know
them before of senior year like I knew
who they were because they were in my
high school but I didn't like no would
that know them and so these were hanging
out with them and so I was like oh yeah
like I don't like although I'll do
whatever you know like I really didn't
have like much friends we hung out
together that was super fun we always
did like parties together and one of my
friends he had like he always had like
poker nights at his house I would always
hang out there and it was just so much
fun and senior years kind of like what
all the drama fizzled out like no one
cared about what had happened last
and everyone kind of just like reunited
so that these nights when my friend
would have people over we would start
inviting like slowly more and more
people and eventually it was just like a
whole senior year thing like a whole
senior class like literally was like a
hundred people in someone's hat or at
someone's house just like hanging out
having fun so that was really nice being
would have kind of push everything to
the side and like it wasn't awkward
anymore when I saw that guy and like
everything like that so that was really
really nice junior and senior years also
the year a lot of people started
drinking so drinking alcohol was
definitely like people were like oh yeah
like where's like whose parents are out
of town like where's the party you know
so like that was very very prevalent
from junior year but especially senior
year and like parties at people's houses
were kind of where everyone like hung
out like it was kind of like a big
reunion like it you know when people are
drunk they don't care who's there this
is like yeah whoo you know like
everyone's here so that was really like
a nice experience just because everyone
kind of got along them and one like
bonded at ease like parties and like
get-togethers and whatnot so I was
always such a goody-goody though so I
was always like the designated driver
I always was the DD like if my friends
drank I didn't care but like I was
definitely the DD at all times so I did
that a lot and it was just fun like
being there with everyone else like I
was one of those people that was like
awkward around people when they were
drinking like I was kind of it I feel
like at every high school this is like a
turning point when people start having
parties my time group kind of just
completely shifted so I was not friends
with any of those guys from a junior
year and I started becoming friends with
these guys who again like I said that
time at Collin that's how I met like all
my guy friends today is from that group
like those are like my best friends to
this day like I love them love all of
them we still have a high school group
message like it's really really nice
like that was when people were like oh
that's that group like that's the group
of friends you know parked together like
senior year we all park next to each
other it was just like really really fun
senior year was honestly such as a
changing point for me like from junior
year like senior year was the best year
of my high school for sure and I tell
people that I'm always like just if
you're high school sucks wait until
senior year and it probably will get
better because everyone's kind of
realize
oh my gosh since the last year we're all
gonna be together we all have to come
away greedy night and like who cares
about the drama it's so much fun and we
would go to country music contents we
would hang out of people's houses we'd
have pool bar dates like it was just
like such a fun experience and that
honestly completely made me like forget
about the past like it did not care
about any drama I just like became so
much more of a more confident person
maybe it's because after like the summer
of travel or something like that did
something to me but I just became
somewhat confident and I was like you
know what who cares if someone doesn't
like me who cares if someone's means to
me like that shows more on them than it
does on me so that just was such a
changing point I just like really really
really loved my senior year of high
school so when I think of high school I
really only think about senior year like
like you guys could tell I don't
remember everything from the years
leading up to it but senior year was
literally like such an amazing year and
it was just so much fun and I had like a
boyfriend senior year and like that was
fun and I don't know I had like spring
break with all my friends and we went to
Myrtle Beach dirty Murdo if anyone's
been there oh I feel like I had a high
school kind of like the movies like it
was just like everyone got together
everyone had fun everyone I don't know
it was just like yeah there was stupid
drama going on but overall it was just
such a fun experience especially that
year and if I could go back to that year
I would try to relive it one more time
and just kind of make those memories
because it really is the only time you
guys are all going to be together like
those back from Europe I'm still friends
with now I would still have a group
message like everything like that but
like it's never gonna be the same like
there's only a handful of us I could see
each other like the rest of them are
different places in the country
especially now we're all moving here so
like it's hard to keep in touch with
people so I really do if you have a good
solid friend group cherish them have fun
it goes by really fast and college goes
by even quicker the fact that I'm
graduating in May is like making me
honestly tira filming a high school
video it's just so weird to me because I
remember senior year so vividly and like
now I'm a senior in college and it's
just bizarre cherish hearing of school
experience and if it sucks college is
way better I am Telling You that don't
peak in high school there's definitely a
few of those especially some of those
people
I really mean to me I'm like you guys
peaked in high school so happy that I
didn't like high school is not
everything so there's a life outside of
it so if you're feeling low if you're
feeling down and even if it is your
senior year and it still sucks like
seriously college is so much better if
you're not going to college at post high
school it's so much better you just have
so much freedom and people really don't
care about you in a good way
it's like you can be for you to do
whatever you want and not have to worry
about people think about you because it
doesn't matter
Tina at high school makes me sad because
love me like so much older than that now
but I don't know if our experiences are
similar at all
I really enjoyed filming this video it
really brought back good and bad
memories but overall good memories like
the bad memories don't sting anymore
like when I say then I'm just like oh
yeah that happened like oh look haha
like whatever like I don't really care
like I don't feel anything towards those
bad memories anymore it's only good men
like when I think I'm high school I only
think of the good times like I just it's
a smile to my face
so even though there were very very bad
times in it so that's hopefully you got
something out of it and this video is
super long but I want to know if you
guys have similarities into my story and
I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
