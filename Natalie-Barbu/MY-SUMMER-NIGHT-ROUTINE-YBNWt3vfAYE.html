super real night routine and I know that
sounds super weird like real night
routine it's just like I'm actually it's
five o'clock I'm filming this and I
decided you know I'm actually gonna show
them when I do at night instead of like
filming it at 12:00 in the afternoon and
then like thinking of what I do at night
which like I totally do that with other
routine videos but I try to stay like
accurate as possible but obviously all
these videos might be a little bit
exaggerated and some of these things I
don't do every single night but for the
most part I'm actually gonna show you
guys what I'm doing tonight which is why
I don't have makeup on because half the
time in the summer I actually don't wear
makeup so yeah I know how to make fun so
there's no need to remove a pickup at
night as so wash my face well but I'm
giving away too many spoilers so but
anyways this video it's a collaboration
with life with Katie and I'm so excited
because it's one of my close
collaborations that I've ever done and I
really love her videos and she's like so
nice and so cool and like she has
amazing editing so you guys really got
to check her out
um link her down below and click right
here to watch it after the misfits video
of course so watch this video and then
watch her video and then you know I
think it'd be cool to show kind of like
two different night routines to
different places of where we live you
know I just think they'd be like super
cool and yeah I really like the idea of
collaborations just because having
YouTube friends is super nice and it's
just a good way to meet people on
YouTube but definitely check out our
