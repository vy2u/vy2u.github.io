to you with another college / school
related video these tend to get a really
positive response and honestly I really
love doing them this is the best time of
year to be them I have the whole other
part of the year to do fun and cool
videos but this is basically my one time
to kind of sit down and talk to you guys
about my experiences and yeah I'm just
really excited to do these just because
I love kind of giving advice and tips
and just talking to you about my life
stories so I'm going to give you seven
tips on just what I learned in college
how to survive college all that good
stuff for you guys going into college I
also did a high school one of these so
you guys can check that out for those of
you going into high school and let me
know other videos that you want me to do
whether they're fun talking whatever so
let's just get into the city up before I
forget to mention this video is a collab
with my best friend on YouTube it's
death round so please check her out
she's awesome I love her yeah I'll talk
more about her at the end but seriously
like she's the bomb calm so I will have
her linked it down below and check out
her video she has a life hacks video for
you guys so now let's get started into
this video and then go watch her is
please go Watchers super number one is
to meet the people that live in your
dorm or on your hallway just meet your
neighbors they will become your best
friends I promise you I know going into
college
everyone kind of shy and kind of nervous
and you don't really know anyone um even
if you went with a bunch of people from
your high school
you still don't really know anyone
because college is huge it's very very
big it's tens of thousands of people if
you go to a big school like I do but
yeah meet the people on your whole name
will become your best friend they'll be
the people you go out with they'll be a
people you meet lunch with dinner with
if you're bored and want to watch TV
they will be those people so please loot
them there are probably all really
really cool too so you know just knock
on their door that's basically what we
did we could keep our door open or
sometimes we just knocked on their door
we're like hey
your neighbors totally do that no one is
gonna be like you know what's ahead but
everyone wants to meet people so you
should never be the one to take
initiative tip number two is to plan
everything out I am not kidding you guys
if you don't have a planner already go
stop this video and go buy one because
they are so important I did not use them
in high school I didn't need one in high
school I could basically manage
everything on my own but in college you
can't it's a very big wake up call on
all the work that you need to do along
with other things like I'm in a sorority
and I know some school and then I have
you too and I used to babysit but I
don't babysit anymore because it was
just way too much and yeah you
definitely need that time to plan
everything
or else you will forget everything on my
planner right now I have film video at a
video upload video those three things
are on I also have for tomorrow's get my
nails done alter my dress like I
literally have everything in my planner
your planner is so important so please
buy a planner I promise you guys you
will definitely need one I had friends
tell me like oh my gosh I totally forgot
to share this and I'm like yo planner
don't know well I mean feel bad for you
because if you had well that would not
have happened
tip number three is to always go out
with a group of people and never go
anywhere by yourself I'm not talking
about walking to class or anything this
is more for like the nightlife at
college please don't ever go anywhere by
yourself there's so many scary tragic
stories of people getting kidnapped
raped murdered
because they went out by themselves at a
college and the last post they were seen
was a bar with a random guy please don't
let that happen to you and don't let you
look don't let yourself be another face
on the news
like please just go out with a group of
people and make sure that they never
leave you never leave them you guys have
each other's backs like it's very sad
that we have to look out for these
things but we do and especially as girls
we have to look out for it more so
please just always go through the
peephole never go by yourself it's very
scary especially because guys know that
they're gonna be drunk girls walking
home from the bar girls walking home at
1:00 a.m. and they're going to look for
that if they're looking for something so
please just make sure you go out with a
group of people it's so important and
yeah I just really advise that because
going out by yourself can be really
scary at night because it's very sketchy
people walk around at night especially
around college towns tip number four is
something that not a lot of people told
me I just kind of had to learn for
myself so that's why I'm gonna tell you
guys but make weekly trips to the
grocery store you wanna have food in
your dorm or your apartment and you will
eat it very very quickly and after about
a week a lot of subtext you get old I'm
not I'm not like fish and or fish I'm
really hoping on of you insufficient
here for my tour that was well I meant
to say chips and I get the thinking fish
and chips I
chips don't get bad but other things get
bad and thanks for smelling especially
with your fridge so definitely make sure
you get weekly trips to the grocery
store so that you're not starving
yourself especially when you have an
apartment that is only a necessity at
the dorm room you can get by like two
three weeks but apartment you need
weekly trips like there's not even a
doubt about that I'm just told me that
because the dining hall gets very old
very fast so tip number five is to clean
up after yourself
you will hate living in the mess at
least I do I know if you have a messing
them at home in might be easier but I
serum at home typically your mom is
yelling at you to clean up your room
over here your mom's not yelling at you
to clean up your room so you're not to
take responsibility for that
so definitely sing it up a declutter
verb like when my room is messy I kind
of get stressed out and I know a lot of
people are not like that but I
definitely am and I just think when you
have a neat room everything kind of
flows better you think better you're
less stressed you're more relaxed
so definitely clean up your room it
literally does not take long your room
it's like a box anyways it should not
take long to put stuff away so my advice
is when you take off your clothes hang
them right back up in your closet when
you take something out put it right back
right away so it doesn't pile up that's
my tip but also if you have a roommate
even if your roommate is kinda messy you
don't want to be the person that's
Messier or else they might get really
annoyed and that just makes drama fights
whatever depending on how that person is
but just clean up after yourself or
respect for the other person also
because I know that that would be really
annoying if my roommate had like a giant
mess and like we understood that like
sometimes that would happen and that was
okay but if you're living a little in a
mess like backing an annoying or whoever
it is especially because it's not that
perfect mess totally different one it's
another person's message so just clean
up after yourself just to save you
stress and drama tip number six is to
call your family they miss you they
really do your family misses you so much
they're constantly thinking about you I
need to comment on two days in a row and
she texted me hey why don't you call
today but yeah call them they miss you I
miss them too obviously but it's a lot
easier to get wrapped up in college than
to be constantly worrying about your
child at home so yeah definitely call
them it's easy to get wrapped up and
it's easy to think like oh my gosh
college no parents but they are great
you're gonna realize it was
because they'll miss a bunch of little
things that they did that you didn't
realize and just call them just be like
hey I just wanted this class tonight
suck sure I went to this class today and
it was awesome this is what I did tell
them little things about your day
because I promise you they will
appreciate that no parent it's gonna be
like it why are you calling me get out
of here even if they joke about it I
know that they deep down do not believe
it
number seven is probably the most
important one and it's the best part
about college is that you can be
yourself I just start something new that
you want to start be yourself is this
college this is the time for that I
remember when I entered college not a
lot of people know about my youtube and
that's so hard for me to believe but I
was just like oh my gosh what are people
at high school been insane and by that
time I was doing YouTube for a couple
years now
so it was a really big secret to keep in
and it really like pained me to keep it
in like not even some of my friends knew
I don't know why I was embarrassed I
really don't know because right now I
like advertised it to everyone I don't
tell everyone but I was an ex entering
college I was like I'm in college I can
do this I can be myself so I announced I
announced it and it got such a positive
response whereas I was so worried in
high school about what people would
think about me but in college people
don't care about what the little things
is that you're doing like you have so
much more to think about you have so
much more self call are just kind of a
selfish time you can work on yourself
this is the only time in your life that
you can be totally selfish and focus on
you and that's honestly such a great
thing I'm not saying selfish in a bad
way but it's selfish in a great way to
focus on your goals and yourself so ya
start something you know me and my best
friend just started the website it's
called becoming radio calm if you guys
watched my launch video thank you so
much I love you guys it is a website for
girls that feel into care
lonely worthless and they can come
together on this site and kind of
hopefully be encouraged by our blog
posts or be encouraged by us just
sharing our life experiences and you can
have like prayer requests to leave for
us to pray for you guys about so you
guys can check that out if you want I'll
throw him here but anyways I started I'm
not in college I would have never
thought to start that in high
because college you could start anything
you want you can be anything you want do
whatever you want in college like
obviously I mean it is a time to
experiment but seriously like that's the
great thing about a start up a business
start up anything this is your one time
can be selfish so do it
and sack my piece of advice for you that
is all the since I have for this video
