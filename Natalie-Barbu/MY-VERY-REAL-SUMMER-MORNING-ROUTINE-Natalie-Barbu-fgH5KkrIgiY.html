morning routine I wanted to film a very
raw and real morning routine and Ron
reel are the key words to my videos
lately and I really hopefully you guys
are liking him I want to show you guys
exactly what I do in the mornings in
real time no more YouTube where you film
your morning routine at 3:00 p.m. not
even in the morning and like you make it
all up and you act out for the camera no
I'm showing you guys what I really
really do and I'm so excited so I just
woke up wash my face brush my teeth if
you guys want to see my skincare routine
on the link down below that was my
previous video so be sure to check that
out I always just try to get up as early
as possible around 8:30 it's like the
common time that will get up I just like
starting my day early comment down below
if you guys are more night people or
morning people I would so much rather
wake up early than wake up late and like
waste half my day because I like being
in bed at a reasonable time cuz I'm a
grandma I look so beyond pale you guys
the first thing that I do though is I
get dressed and go to the gym or I get
dressed for the gym I get dressed for
the gym and that is what motivates me to
go right away but I always go basically
first thing in the morning before I go
to the gym I have to clean my room
this is comment below if you want a room
tour when this is actually clean
okay this is much better I always get
ready at the gym so I bring a change of
clothes so this is what I'll be wearing
afterwards just a denim jackets and a
cute little romper if you have been
following my vlog channel you know that
my apartment smells and I'm pretty sure
that its mold that it smells like I I
don't know for sure but I think so and
basically what I have been doing is
spraying this natural like odor removing
spray all over my apartment basically
every single day it helps with the smell
eventually comes back but I'm just gonna
spray this everywhere right now let's
spray this on my way to the gym this is
the gym outfits of the day I'm wearing
this sports bra from forever 21 everyone
is the greatest sports bras I'm telling
you especially because I don't really
need much support so it's great and then
I'm wearing these Lululemon high waisted
leggings I love high waisted leggings
they just like make me feel so much more
secure
I guess cuz I hate it when I'm wearing a
sports bra and like low-rise things then
I'm just wearing these Nikes the grey
Nikes that I wear every day it's time to
get my workout in
just got back from the gym and now I'm
off to Starbucks I don't come to
Starbucks every single morning but I do
like going to a coffee shop a lot
honestly every day since I've been here
which I'm sending so much money on food
it's kind of ridiculous but you look I'm
only gonna be eating out this first
month and then the second month I'll
start cooking it's just so much good
food here that I'm like I want to try it
all and I don't know I'll save money
when I live at home I guess
it's a stupid mentality I know I'm at
these Starbucks reserve and I'm just
gonna get breakfast here a little
something to keep me full right before
lunch
I just finished eating at Starbucks and
once it's done with that I basically go
on with my day I will go back and film a
video or always happen so I'll go back
and film a video or I'll just like chill
and watch some Netflix or go to a coffee
shop and edit another coffee shop or
I'll stay there and edit that's
basically all I do in the morning
I feel like this video was super just
simple like basic but I know you guys
wanted to see morning routines and you
guys like these style videos like very
real vlog type videos comment down below
if you like these videos better than the
whole like filming it at 3 p.m. and just
like making it a little more artsy I
feel like that's like old YouTube but I
really do listen to your comments so if
you guys want to see any other videos
please tell me because the reason I
filmed this was because I saw a lot of
people filming or wanting me to film a
morning routine so I really hope you
guys enjoy I'm gonna move on with my day
but I hope you guys like this video be
sure to subscribe if you're new here I
post videos like this you can check out
my other ones I also have a vlog channel
