and Florida it is so nice out today and
it's so nice because it's kind of cold
in North Carolina already but right now
I'm going to Beach
aha
so I'm waiting right add in so I'm
waiting for my dad in the parking garage
we are going to breakfast and then we
are going to the beach super excited
because ever been to the beach in so
long I actually haven't been to Miami
since March which is the longest I have
ever gone without coming here for those
of you guys who don't know I am
originally from here so that is why I
come here all the time
where I was born where I was raised I
basically just came here because my dad
was coming down and he was like hey do
you want to come with me so obviously I
said yes and it's great not having
Friday classes and I actually only have
one Thursday class and then I ended up
being cancelled so it worked out
perfectly I was gonna skip it anyways
but it worked out so I my weekend
started on Wednesday which is pretty
awesome perks of being in college and
getting to choose your own schedule and
making a really great schedule for one
semester but yeah excuse my face I've
been breaking out shocker you guys know
that in my other videos I've talked
about it don't like it but whatever like
I'm not gonna hide from you guys I just
feel like that's stupid because everyone
breaks out
everyone has pimples and if you don't
well whatever but everyone has their own
issues so yeah that's what I'm doing
here and I'm gonna vlog this weekend so
it's only me and my dad I'm probably
gonna be kind of bored sometimes not
like anything bad against my dad but
just like I don't have like a friend
here you don't have like my sisters or
my brother or anything like that so the
camera will keep me company I'm super
excited for this trip and where this
weekend I was counting down the days
and I actually the test when I get back
but
we are at the beach right now with my
master in the way and I'm just laying
out in tannic not naked
but yeah we're laying out in th water
but it's so nice I could not have asked
for like better weather in dovabear
because normally when I come to Florida
no it's not like
really really pretty good morning guys
so it is currently Friday than I could
say that I'm here it's the second day
that I'm officially here I guess I got
here on Wednesday but I didn't do
anything um so it's the second day that
I'm here and yesterday I forgot to close
out the blog but basically I actually
got my hair done um you'll see it more
like I don't know if you guys can tell
it's just like a little lighter and a
lot more Ashley so it's not really like
as gold anymore which that's like what I
wanted and then I went to Miami Heat
basketball game which was super fun
last time I was there I'm pretty sure
Shaq was on the team so it was a while
ago
I don't even think he plays basketball
anymore yeah he definitely doesn't but
um yeah that's the last time I was there
so it's been a good bit it's been a good
bit I have a not I'm really sad because
I never got to see LeBron but like I
guess we don't talk about him Miami
because he left us but whatever
um I wish I still got the N and yeah it
was really really fun I really like
basketball games especially if I
actually care about the team if I don't
care about the team I don't like any
sporting event but basketball games are
pretty fun um so that's what we did and
then I think that's literally like all I
did at SIA hair which took like three
hours to do I hate when I sleep with it
in a ponytail and it's all like messed
up and then basketball game so and also
and now now I'm going to the beach again
and then I'm going to the Messiah villa
and I'm actually gonna get some drone
footage cuz I think I want to do like a
travel diary here even though I haven't
started so but I don't know what I'll do
maybe I'll put it in this long yeah I'm
excited
so hope you guys like it I don't know
oh thank you around with me on my date
and beach-ready you guys so I don't
think I should get my bathing suit
yesterday so this is from Victoria's
Secret and it's really cute just cross
this over and you can literally have any
size boobs I think this ranges from an a
to a C so yeah obviously for me since I
don't have as much it doesn't show
cleavage but if you're like a C and you
want to wear this you totally can - and
then the bottoms are also from
Victoria's Secret and they are really
cute they're a little bit more cheeky
though but yeah this is the look
also I wanted to just let people know to
follow me on snapchat I'm like really
into my story this was the game have a
good fire well but like I just like
doing like weird stuff on it I don't
know all of you guys shout out here I'll
put the thing maybe it works like that
scan of this does that work let me know
if it works
I used to believe we were burning on the
edge of the beautiful something
beautiful selling a dream
smoking me a risky persuade so that's
what happened but I'll just sit down and
run it through with you guys what we did
today but I don't think any better but
anyways okay so what we did was we went
to the the sky of illa I think it's
called design or Villa biscaia it's
Museum and guarded highly recommend if
you weren't in Miami it's beautiful it's
one of those historic old rich people
houses so so nice and now they turned it
into a place where you can buy tickets
and take a tour and you can't take
pictures inside we can outside and
outside is where the real beauty is so
that's all good but yeah so we went
outside we toured the house we saw the
gardens in the villa and it's all just
so so beautiful I have so many pictures
from and I got some scenes but I really
wanted to actually work on my
photography skills there so I got more
photography pictures and then we went to
Shake Shack and that was so good as
always and then I am now I'm just here
so if you're leaving dude like too much
today besides the sky villa filled with
sky whatever so so nice though totally
recommend a my cousin is awesome and
she's gorgeous I got some pics of her
and like oh my god she makes my jaw
gonna be so easy cuz she's so pretty so
like I think any setting would have been
good I just like hate how like school is
kind of in the way like I know school
should be my number one priority but
right now it's really not it may be that
um because I'm an engineering major and
school should definitely be my number
one priority cuz it's so hard but I just
feel like I'm pushing everything off and
I'm like I don't really care about
anything because all I want to do this
focus on YouTube or now I want to do
photography and just like it's really
hard having two things that are two
polar opposites and absolutely loving
one and not loving the other and
focusing on the other one don't get me
wrong I'm happy I do engineering but
it's definitely not my passion and it's
not what I love if I'm being honest so I
don't know YouTube is definitely what I
love being worth being with a camera
what I love so I don't know it's really
really hard and finals are coming up so
that's not really good but this semester
is a lot easier an accessor is actually
a lot harder so it's gonna be kind of
tough but yeah there's a little mini
update on my life hopefully this vlog
isn't too boring cuz I'm like talking to
you guys a lot even if I'm not taking
you necessarily with me just today but I
did yesterday but yeah now I'm about to
go eat some pizza even though I already
had Shake Shack for dinner so healthy
eating last night I also had McDonald's
guys so start of the last day here in
Miami you're really really sad I just
studied at Starbucks for a little bit
while my dad was off playing tennis and
then yeah that's basically all I did I
didn't actually study that much and then
I um yeah it's a really nice day and I'm
super sad that I have to leave today but
I think I'm going to try to fly my drone
today hopefully hopefully it's not too
windy either but I really enjoyed my
time here and I cannot wait to be back
next month yeah I'll be back in a month
