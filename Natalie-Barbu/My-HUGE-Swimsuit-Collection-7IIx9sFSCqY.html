addicted to bathing suits okay hi
everyone so now that I have admitted my
problem that is the first step in
recovery so now I'm just going to be
showing you guys a swimsuit collection
of mine and I thought is the perfect
person to do this swimsuit collection
video because I probably have the most
bathing suits out of every single person
that I know I have so many bathing suits
you guys like I really do have a problem
I didn't even realize how many bathing
since I had until I started pulling them
out of my drawer in order to film this
video and I realized yeah I definitely
have a problem I am going to kind of do
this video first I'm gonna show you
bathing suits that I have as a pair so
normally most of my bathing suits are
not matchy-matchy like I just kind of
mix and match tops and bottoms so first
I'm just going to show you the bathing
suits that I do have a top and a bottom
four and then I'm just going to show you
bathing suits that are kind of all mix
and match so I'm just going to jump
right in because I do have a lot of
faith in soup
so the first thing I'm going to start
out with is going to be my one-piece and
I only have one one-piece and the reason
I bought this one-piece is because I
needed it for a church camp that I was
going to it was in Panama City Beach and
was with my church and since it was like
a church camp we weren't allowed to wear
two pieces so I have to buy a one-piece
for the trip it looks like this it's
like bubblegum pink and the sleeves are
super thick and then I have like this
like cute thing in the middle and it's
just a one-piece so next bathing suit is
a two-piece and this
American Eagle this was during my stage
where I was working at American Eagle
and I bought everything in sight so I
got this bathing suit it's purple and
then it has three straps in the back
which is really cool and then the
bottoms are just purple and they have
that like pinkish orange color at the
top so it matches next bathing suit is
actually my oldest bathing suit that I
own I got this I think in like seventh
grade and if you guys don't know I am
pretty flat-chested I am NOT very curvy
at all just gonna put it that way so
this is a little bit small on me now but
honestly it's not even that small on me
um I in seventh grade it was like whoa
it has padding in it like I was like but
anyway so most of you guys probably had
this bathing suit because literally
everyone I knew had it
it's from Abercrombie Anna it's just the
navy blue striped bathing suit and I
have the bottom student with it
I think the bottoms are all like as I
don't know if you can see but they're
all I've been through the washing
machine it's had its good run I don't
really wear this bathing suit anymore
but I have it because it does fit me
still so why would I give it away but
yeah so mostly guys obably have this
comment down below if you guys have this
bathing suit or remember this bathing
suit
next bathing suit I have is from Gilly
Hicks and it is Gilly Hicks is actually
like the same brand as our copy in
Hollister but it's not as known and it's
just a coral bathing suit it's triangle
it has crocheted detailing on these
sides so it's just a plain Triangle
bikini and then the bottoms are just
plain bottoms with the Gilley Hicks logo
on the side next one is another popular
one that you probably remember from
middle school maybe freshman year of
high school depending how old you are
obviously it's also from Abercrombie I
think yeah and it is this like kind of
tie-dyed pink one and it's triangle I
thought it was really cute this one
definitely
that's me because it's a little bit
bigger than the other one um and then
again just the tie-dye pink bottoms next
matings - I got this summer and it is
another triangle one but this one is
really cute I really like it because I
like the color because you don't see
most bathing suits in this color since
most bathing suits are like bright
colors it's just a maroon bathing suit
from Target and it's like really like
cinched up I don't know why but I'm not
that small but and then it just has
square cutouts on the side and a
turquoise bead in the middle and then I
got the bottoms with it which are just
plain maroon bottoms next bathing suit
is also from Target and I know that they
sold it in stores is here but I got it
last year it is my American flag one so
the bottoms look like this and these
bottoms are actually huge on me they're
size medium which I know it's like huge
so it's reversible it's red stripes on
this side and then American flag stars
on this side so you can wear this one of
the stripes if it's not 4th of July and
then stars if it is 4th of July my next
lady sue is my all-time favorite bathing
suit and it is the each brand triangle
which many of you have probably heard of
because triangle is actually pretty big
a lot of celebrities have it and I've
just seen out a lot of Instagram and
YouTube peoples post the bottoms look
like this and they're like um I don't
know what the material is called but
it's kind of like scuba material like
when you go scuba scuba diving so it's
just plain like turquoise or mint green
or whatever I think this was called
Miami mint I think that's the color and
then black around the edges so something
so simple can be so cute and then the
top it has no padding in it so I thought
okay that's really weird but it's
actually like really cute and it kind of
like makes you look more curvy if you
know what I mean but yeah this is my
favorite bathing suit not only for the
fact that it kind of adds some curve
on you but just because it is really
cute and it is so flattering next dating
suit is also from American Eagle
actually it's from Erie but same thing
it is just pink crochet just hot pink
crochet triangle and then hot pink
crochet but this next one I put it
together as a pair but it's actually
from two different stores but I wear
these a lot together I were actually
yesterday the top is from Target and
it's just um like aqua turquoise and it
has the gold chains in the middle with
kind of like a braided panic a braided
bracelet which is like in the middle of
it and it's super cute it's just a band
oh and then the bottoms I got from
Victoria's Secret and they're hot pink
and have kind of like the same braided
materials right here I'm actually really
upset though because the very first day
I wear it this broke off so like it's
really annoying when I wear it but I
still love it and this is probably my
favorite bottoms that I own because I
love the size of it and I think they
look really cute together this is
probably like my all-time favorite
bathing suit I just got it this month I
bought it online at the Victoria Secret
like bathing suit sale it's this top so
it's kind of crushed like lacy material
with a lot of pastel flowers and pastel
colors on it it has padding but it does
not have any push ups so I really liked
it actually like if I had push up I
wouldn't mind but I still really like it
and the bottoms are so cute they're the
same material and they're just roughly
around the edges and they is a string
bathing suit so yeah that's just what it
looks like this looks so good on it
makes you look so tan I love this
bathing suit this next lady - I bought
this year in Mexico when I went and it
is from the stores in Gaara it's a
Mexican brand store but I know they have
it some places in the u.s. so the top is
just neon green neon yellow whatever you
call this color and
in the middle of it it has like a little
slit in the middle and then it has all
these cool jewels and blue and pink
beading on it the bottoms are kind of
like a really cheeky they're like the
Brazilian bottoms so they don't cover
much but yeah that's what the back looks
like and that is what the front looks
like but those sides are so cute it has
the same beading that the slit had this
is expanding suits I also got an
American Eagle like many of my big suits
and it is just a lot of like different
greens blues purple colors at the bottom
with some neon yellow string and then
the fringe sorry guys the fringe top
that I have and then this one used to be
my mom's bathing suit and she just
passed it down to me so the bottoms are
a little big on me but it still fits and
then the top is super cute it's white it
doesn't padding so like you can't really
get wet in it because it's kind of
see-through but it's white without
padding and it has a giant stone blue
heart and then this pattern on the back
and on the tie of it and then the
bottoms are the same color as the
pattern or is the same pattern as the
pattern and it's just these blue and
brown and white hearts and spades or
whatever it is I don't even know okay
guys so you thought that was it right no
no no I have like double that too now in
just the ones that I mix and match so
I'm just going to kind of put them out
randomly and then I
literally mix and match any of these
even if they don't really match so let's
start with this one so this is ages hot
pink bando that I have actually I did
not purchase this my best friend Alden
gave it to me because she outgrew these
and so of course they fit me for example
you can wear with these bottoms that you
can also wear with a bunch of other tops
it's just this I don't really know where
this is from it's stripes and it just
has a ton of colors and it has a belt
which i think is really cool
next bottoms are these from Target that
I love and these are red and yellow and
have a tribal print and you can wear
them with so many different colors and
they are very flattering
this next one still has the tag on it
and I'm pretty sure I got it last year I
honestly have no idea how to wear this
um keep in mind that my little sister
got this and just put it in my drawer
so I technically didn't buy it I don't
know if it's a one-shoulder or if it's
something like this I honestly have no
clue how to wear this this next baby to
kobato
I'll be honest with you I really don't
know why I bought it actually I do know
why it was four dollars so I was like
hey why not and I regret it because I
really don't wear it it's from Target
it's I actually just fit me but it's
just purple and white and I barely ever
wear it next top is also one that my
best friend Alden gave me so this one is
a black just crochet top and then it has
the little like different layer right
there so I did not pay for this my
friend Alden gave it to me next bottoms
ice as you guys can tell I have a lot of
striped bottoms but it's another striped
one it's from Target it has purple blue
orange a bunch of colors that you can
wear with a bunch of colored tops
it's next top that I got is also from
Target and it is a push-up but it's not
really a push-up it has a giant bow on
it I love this bathing suit so much I
think it's so cute so it's just a giant
bow it's the next bathing suit is from
American Eagle and it is X actually
push-up bathing suit and it kind of
looks like a bra I don't know and then
it has the halter on it it's bottoms are
these Roxy bottoms and again my little
sister about these I didn't much put
them in my drawer they are black and
just have Roxy all over them this next
top is from Victoria's Secret and I have
barely ever born this top I just thought
it was kind of cool I don't really know
why I bought it again these are like
years old but it is a bunch of different
layers and then it has a little confetti
so I feel like I look kind of like a
clown in it this next top is from
American Eagle and it kind of basically
is a strapless bra like it looks like
strapless bras next one is from
Victoria's Secret I got this a couple
years ago and it was my very first
push-up bathing suit so it is this blue
with black flowers on it and this was
seriously like revolutionary when I got
it and it has just the striped black
strip next bathing suit is this one
that's one of my favorites actually it's
from Target and it has again that little
fabric layer I rather like in right now
this like piece and it's just kind of
like a peach salmon color and it's just
a bandeau this next bottom is just solid
color blue from Victoria's Secret next
one my friend Alden gave it to me again
she gave me quite a few of them it's
kind of a push-up Victoria's Secret one
it's not really that big of a push-up
but it's a little bit and it's purple
and it has a halter my next one is from
Gilly Hicks again or my second one from
Gilly Hicks it is just a white banjo
with little eyelet Lettieri eyelet
flower things so I'm is really with door
a secret and it is just this I don't
even know what this print is called its
main color is black and just has a bunch
of different flowers and leaves on it in
all different colors this next one is
also from Victoria's Secret and it's
just plain blue next one is like the
very first one that I showed you and it
is just plain purple with the little tie
and my friend Alden gave this one to me
as well this next one I got this summer
it is from Topshop at the mall it is
just like it's basically like that other
bando and then I showed you with the
fabric thing and it's kind like a salmon
peach color and it has a tie and I
really like it because of the little
triangle in the middle I think it's very
very cute this one is also like the
purple one that I just showed you and
the very first one that I showed you
except it is stripes
so it's multi-coloured and again my best
friend Alton gave this one to me next
one is one of my favorites it's from
Abercrombie I think let me see
yeah Abercrombie and Fitch and it again
is like one of those with the extra
fabric and little layer of it so it kind
of looks like a really really crop top
this next one is from Victoria's Secret
and it is a bando and you just tie it in
the middle and it's green and it reminds
me of a watermelon Swan is just a plain
white bikini bottom I love this one just
because I feel like every single girl
needs a black and white bikini bottom
just to wear with anything and of course
since I mentioned every girl needs a
white and black line here is my flat one
and it's a different shape I just got
this one this year and at the
semi-annual sale it is also like
Brazilian it's like really cheeky it's
black and this is the front and this is
the back so it is does not cover that
much skin but it's definitely not like a
thong my next one I actually do have
bottoms too but I have absolutely no
idea where they are so I probably should
find them is this one from Victoria's
Secret it is lace neon green and
underneath the lace is purple or I don't
know if it's lace was more like lacrosse
penny material next one is this van
dough from Victoria's Secret and it has
a star in the middle so I think it's so
cute and it's plain white and I bought
this with some navy blue bottoms and I
don't know
are either and last but not least I have
a tankini also for the same reason that
I have a one-piece so I got this tankini
so is from Old Navy it's purple it has
kind of like a banjo thing at the top
then just backward at the bottom and it
has a gold little I don't know it's
called
the burette thing I don't know in it
just to give it kind of an accent and it
is a halter top
