super exciting video and I like cannot
believe that the day has come where I
can film this video hi everyone okay so

inspired from Aria Montgomery from
Pretty Little Liars just wiggle the wand
but the first question is what is my
name
well if you didn't know my my screen
name Natalie is my name mice use your
next thing is be by net EXO so I guess
mad Natalie but you guys have to pick
that up but I am in Seventeen magazine
page 42 I have a full page for my stuff
it's just like eating that I'm gonna
press my blog and it says my age and
tiny hometowner it's kind of my last
summer as a high school because it will
be I'll be a senior this summer see new
years next year
and next summer it's already like I'm
gonna be going off to college it's just
weird
like what do you want to do when you
leave for school I want to go to college
and I want to study Industrial
Engineering
I would let me go to a crime Center and
seascape
yeah those of you tonight talk to
schools today I am going to be coming
and ring boy for you guys and this is a
dorm room tour which you guys have never
seen before so this is what my room
looks like once you enter their room

York I'm waiting for staff to come and
we'd actually like never met in person
before so I am so excited
hey guys so I'm here with hey guys so
today I am showing you guys what a
typical day in the life of a college
student is actually like like what the
heck do college students do besides go
to class and she also just got engaged
so with your congratulations okay I'll
try to choke clothes I know this is like
an awful camera my camera died I'm sorry
you guys but I do definitely need to
like wear makeup because I feel so
unconfident and insecure in my own skin
whenever I have acne
I understand what it's like to feel
insecure in your own skin
I am filming my skincare routine my skin
for the most part is totally clear and
I'm finally comfortable going on camera
without makeup on like I am right now
this is seriously my most requested
video ever um ever since anyone finds
out I am an engineering major in college
everyone wants me to do a video about
engineering's
I just got my hair done with Tresemme
and I got these cool space funds and the
braids and pull em in his hair and yeah
this is the look I really really love it
I love how different it is because I
didn't want to just get anything like
that I do all the time I always do
either waves or straight so that's why I
wanted to do this the line

huge giveaway for you guys and that day
has come because we just hit 100k on
Monday or Tuesday I forgot what day it
was but this week we hit a hundred
thousand subscribers and that is just
the most insane thing ever because I
never thought like I'm gonna be a little
sappy here but starting out this whole
YouTube journey years ago as like a
hobby posting like literally three times
a year like literally no videos ever and
then finally kind of starting to take it
seriously in college and Riaan in kind
of readjusting to youtube and getting
