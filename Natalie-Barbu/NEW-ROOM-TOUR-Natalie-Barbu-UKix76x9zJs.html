am going my room tour in my house at
home so I already have a room tour up
but it is for my college apartment so
much different than this and I really
want to film this because I know people
love room tours and ever since I kind of
got this new background you've all been
asking me about it and just I wanted to
fill my ring tour because I've lived in
this house for years and now after I'm
gone it's finally like the perfect way
that I want it like I'm happy with my
room right now it used to be very like
young and bright and colorful and when I
left for college my mom just wanted to
kind of neutralize it before I heard
this video if you guys are new here
please be sure to subscribe and if you
guys want to see my other videos or my
other room tour video I will have that
link down below give this video a thumbs
up because that helps actually a lot
more than you guys think it's not just
like a like it's really helpful to kind
of find people on YouTube and stuff like
that so I would love it if you guys
would do that and also I wanted to do a
giant disclaimer that I am NOT doing
history tour to brag I know my room is a
lot bigger than most average person's
room by a lot I don't think this is like
a casual normal like I know I am very
fortunate so I just want to put that out
there I'm not trying to brag at all like
literally whatsoever not at all
without further ado though I hope they
guys enjoy this video and let's get
started hey guys welcome to my room
I'm going to be giving you guys a report
and injustice for me so this could be
entrance of my room and as you can see
there is just a little hallway leading
up to it there is an overview of my room
so it's very cozy I love the way I
decorated it and made sure it's very
neutral colors and not like bright
orange bright yellow like anything like
that and look very neutrals I'm like a
white black beige type of person if you
guys can't tell here we are going to
start at my desk and it is the part that
is the new
I just decorated it for the video so the
background of the videos is amazing but
this is actually my favorite painting in
my room it's not even a painting but
it's like my favorite little piece of
art thing that I got is from home good
the little lamb I hate it so cute and
it's white to imagine but then I
wouldn't frame it's just so freakin cute
and I love waking up in the morning to
the face of an animal so we're here I
have this kind of like green grass
shrubbery thing I really like having
popped up green and like plants in my
room it's fake but it is from home
though so yeah I thought it was really
very huge then over here we have this
decoration from Target it kind of
reminds me of some like ads checky
vase I just matched it with my whole
room I loved the color it's kind of like
a blue grey and I keep my potential in a
gold jar then over here on my wall I
have these mirrors and a really cute
they kind of make the shape of an arrow
and at first they were horrible but I
decided to make them vertical to make
them a little different than what I
first saw there from Target there's gold
mirrors and then over here I have
another frame and this is from Target
too and it's really pretty a quick black
took a paint strokes I think on it with
another wooden frame I really liked that
the woods are not the same things I
could fit a little more of a style like
the lamb versus the black and white and
then I have a gold clock so this
actually works I never put batteries in
it but it is really really cute and I
have a marble background I think it is
so so cute and then my favorite
decoration on my wall is actually this
succulents I think it's it's not real
but it is from Target and I thought it
was just adorable because it's in a
tribe or not triangle it's an assignment
and I just thought that was a really
really different and I love that kind of
sticks out from my wall and it's so cute
and then that's my desk I actually do
homework here some in summer classes um
so I got this lamp from Target and it
has a marble base and it has gold also
so I thought that was really cute and
different than the normal lamps that I
see I also have a sign that says hustle
this is from home guys and it's I
hustled in gold and I love that I have
this white candle and it is from Home
Guard or Target I'm not sure which one I
think is from home go smells so amazing
oh my gosh any matches my room got
another candle from Anthropologie so
it's really really good and then I have
this candle that I actually got my high
school graduation and I've had a lot of
my presents from high school graduation
hidden in a box and I just found it so
yeah since in like four years ago
oh my gosh I also am a freak about
organizing so I have my first I just a
coffee is then I do the things book just
so cute Mike and Katie got this for me
and I just plan out my youtube videos in
here so it's just a nice small notebook
then I have my Erin Condren agenda so
this I actually used during the school
year so I planned everything out wrote
on my homework whatever I had to do love
it Erin Condren is my favorite and then
because I'm like I said I'm a freak
about organizing I have another agenda
so this is from Target I just thought it
was really cute in a matching room and
it starts in July so I haven't really
used it yet but I am planning stuff out
underneath the desk I just have this
marble board and I have I wrote rise &amp;amp;
grind onyx oh I really like that quote
and drew a little badly drawn coffee mug
in it but I was going to put it on my
wall and it didn't match so I just have
it there for now until I can figure out
what to do with it and then my chair
which I love it is a clear role each
chair and I have favorite fur blanket on
it I think it just adds a nice
decorative touch to it
so this blanket is from Target this
chairs for a Pottery Barn and the desk
is also from Pottery Barn in case anyone
is going to ask on this wall next to my
desk I have this kinda piece of our rug
I guess could come up and it is from
Target really cute matches my wall love

nice neutral yellow color and then over

my second favorite part
so this bed is one of my favorites just
because I had been wanting an iron a

moved into this house I convinced my mom
to let me get one because she hates them
and it's black I love it I think it just
like makes my room look so like put
together and then I have on my bed I
have this quilt and it actually doubles
with my secret comforter I think 10
people can use this as their main thing

color and I actually have this in my
college apartment so I just brought it
home from there so this will be leaving
