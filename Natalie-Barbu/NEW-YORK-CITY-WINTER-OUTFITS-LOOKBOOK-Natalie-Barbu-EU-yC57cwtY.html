show you guys a quick outfit video of
what I wore in New York City and one of
the outfits actually got deleted but if
you want to see I even go to my
Instagram but I went to New York City
last week and I want to just fill in my
outfits for you so if you're new please
subscribe and I hope that you guys stick
around but let's just get started with
the outfits so the first one is a very
cozy and cute one it's probably my
favorite and I did this when we went
ice-skating it's super super cute I
absolutely love it the jacket is from
Free People so it's just one of those
teddy coats and I got so many comments
asking where the jacket is from and it's
probably the softest thing I own so the
jacket is from Free People and I wanted
to wear it B needs to cover my ears
because it was super super cold I got
this at a local boutique but the brand
is CC those are the brand names so if
you guys want to look it up at any local
boutique I'm sure that they have it
there and my jeans are brandy melville
but I really don't like them they ended
up being super loose and baggy
throughout the day so I don't recommend
them but I just wanted an all-black
outfit and my turtleneck is also a very
very cozy sweater and it is from Urban
Outfitters
this next outfit was probably a very New
York outfit if you guys understand what
I mean by that comment down below
because I feel like when I say it's very
New York it's like a certain outfit
comes to mind and this is it for me
so my jeans are super cool they're half
that I'm half black half black half
regular denim and they're from slim for
all mankind
I wore these Nike sneakers and my faux
fur jackets from forever 21 and it's
like a faux fur bomber jacket I think
it's so so cool and cute and I just wore
a white turtleneck also from forever 21
and a beanie that I found in my closet I
don't know the brand but really love
this outfit it was really warm and the
jacket is so cool and the next outfit
was definitely our warmer outfit we
decided not to take many photos this day
and just be very very casual and warm so
I am wearing my denim jeans those are
from seven from and kind and I have a
leather jacket this puffer jacket is so
so warm it definitely keeps you warm
100%
I think F Letta has amazing jackets and
it's still kind of slim so it's very
feminine my boots are from pacaya
clothing which is an online store and my
scarf is from Free People and I wore the
same beanie that I wore in yesterday's
outfit so the one that you guys just saw
and/or the shirt I think I just wore
like a black sweater nothing special but
super warm and I really like the scarf
gave it a touch of color so that is
basically it for this vlog or not for
this vlog for this video I hope that you
guys enjoyed please be sure to subscribe
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
