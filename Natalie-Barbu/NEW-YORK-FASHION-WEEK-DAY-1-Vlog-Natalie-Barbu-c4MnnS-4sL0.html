Building

whole life so yeah this is just like
done unbelievable I'm so so grateful to
be here I cannot wait for Fashion Week
tomorrow and to show you guys my outfit

little nightlight I'll talk to you guys
tomorrow morning morning it is day 2 and
I'm at Greece here we are driving in an
uber right now and we are running late
to our Tresemme hair appointment so
that's fun
but we got all dressed up and we took
some pictures this morning and after
this we are taking the vlog pictures and

with my hair because right now it's just
like looks very plain and boring but are
here at the shows so we are back getting
our hair damnit resume but our points

late anymore but I just want to take
show you guys around right now we are at
the e-news little studio place that they

exclusive look and I also just got a
copy at papyrus which they have a cafe
here so yeah that is it I feel really
really important here not gonna lie I'm
like a low key like freaking out on the
inside you guys I just got my hair done
with Tresemme and I got these cool space
funds and the braids and voluminous hair
and yeah this is the look I really
really love it I love how different it
is because I didn't want to just get
anything like that I do all the time I
always do either waves or straight so
that's why I wanted to do this but yeah
I got a Dutch braid so yeah I love it
it's actually not that cold today which
is great and yeah we're headed over to
the Chelsea pier now so for our next

really good out here but you guys I'm
freaking out

that I'm not like a fan or whatever but
yeah we just met her and I thought that

yeah I talked to her for like three
minutes but I know we got her pictures

super long and I don't even care so we
went outside and like so many people

stayed intact so far then still need
like a little more volume right here but
that's the plan we're gonna head off
remember after this so I have not kept
up with you guys lately but that's just
because we've been in the hotel room so

birthday we're going out to dinner um
but yeah so that's what's going on right
now and before dinner I actually ate
like a whole like portion of truffle
fries that I'm pretty sure it's like an
appetizer to split between like three or
four people so that's that um but yeah
