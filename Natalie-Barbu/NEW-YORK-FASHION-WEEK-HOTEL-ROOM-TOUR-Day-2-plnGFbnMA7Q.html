know why it somewhere we are getting any
free photo shoots we are meeting the
photographers here in Starbucks and we
are going to go up to a photo shoot
today and today's look I have really
really big curls I never do this looks
it's certainly different like a side
part with big curls but I kind of like
it and I'm having four again of course
it's not going if you don't have fur and
you know this about I'll show you more
in pictures throughout the day I'm
really excited right now the
photographer in Greece and we are
getting some photos taken they look so
good so far but it's also really cool
and this one eye is just like watering
for me like only this one so I'm hoping
my makeup is fine but whatever it's not
raining and it's supposed to rain so
knock on wood so yeah I'm excited and I
will link to all the photos down below
and I will like shelise a website down
below so because in the New York area
hit her up so she takes a really great
pictures oh my hair well we are at the
show
yeah my hair is not looking good after
this right okay yeah excited and the
setup it's really pretty it's very like
they sell off bigger than yesterday
they gave us this cute little number
really cute
lunch for today I am eating at how do
you say grace I have no idea what you
just said I got the Baker's lunch it's
huge
I got minestrone soup with half of an
avocado toast and quinoa to believe
grace got the granola yogurt and a latte
I got but it's not here yet the service
I hear actually kind of sucked today
he'd like the waiter didn't come into
like 20 minutes later but oh well we're
having fun
with our face
yeah
the hotel was absolutely beautiful and
everywhere he looked it was just
gorgeous and had perfect decorations and
beautiful colors there was a restaurant
downstairs which I just showed you and
there was also a bar downstairs which
was really pretty the secondly he walked
into a room you had this little greeting
card and to Fiji waters that were just
complimentary to you and this is
actually the king-sized bed so if you
guys were traveling with just another
person this would be the room you would
stay in every room comes with an
espresso with machine which let me tell
you we used very much we definitely used
it up and then the view was by far the
absolutely best part of the whole stay I
absolutely loved looking at the window
every single morning and see it from
your bed very very picture worthy view
of the Empire State Building it was just
gorgeous it was very foggy the day I
filmed this but you can see we're super
super close to the Empire State Building
the bathrooms were also show gorgeous I
loved the black and white I came with a
robe which grace and I used very much
and there's me I kind of matched the
bathroom and this was actually the room
that we stayed in so this was the
double-double and it had all sorts of
snacks of course those who had to pay
for but the artwork was also really
really nice I loved the little
expression on them and then the best
part was the sky bar rooftop so this was
the bar that is very new and it opened
at night and we got a private tour of it
just for you guys so I love the
aesthetic of it and of course the best
part again is the view of the Empire
State Building so so many pictures to
take here it was raining on this day but
we actually got to go outside one day
and just view see the Empire State
Building and it was just gorgeous and I
cannot say enough good thing so thank
you so so much to Archer hotels for
letting us stay there and we enjoy our
time and we'll definitely be staying
again
so this is actually a couple days after
the vlog ended and I know what you guys
are thinking the Natalie this vlog was
so short
I'm currently filming on my iPhone so
throwback to the iPhone of vlogging days
but I don't I didn't realize how short
the vlog number two was but I really
wanted to get it up so I figured now
would be a good time to kind of just sit
down and talk to you guys um I wanted to
say thank you so much first of all this
would not be possible without you guys
and I am actually living my dream right
now like I know I'm a college student
and I know I'm not a full-time youtuber
or anything like that but just the fact
that I'm able to experience these
opportunities and just I'm just like I
don't know just really do what I love
like just being able to go to Fashion
Week which is something I've always
dreamed about doing since I was in like
ninth grade just that is just an
incredible experience and I would not
have been able to go if I didn't do
YouTube videos like I don't know if you
guys want me to do a whole video may be
closer to next Fashion Week on how I
went to Fashion Week and how you can go
to Fashion Week because you like you
can't buy tickets so it's not like that
sort of thing but yeah I'll do something
like that when the time gets closer
because right now like it's not Fashion
Week season anymore but yeah I just want
to say thank you so much to you guys
because I don't think you guys know how
much you mean to me and whenever I'm
having bad days I log on to YouTube
whenever I'm having bad days I'll log on
social media and talk to you guys and
like that just makes me so happy that I
actually have people from around the
world that are my friends like you guys
are not my subscribers you guys are my
friends and I know every youtuber says
that and it gets kind of over used and
it's a cliche and maybe some people
don't mean it like truly truly truly
this year has been not the best year
it's been a little bit rough like just
junior year in general not like 2017
because it just started 2017 it's been
great but just like junior year in
general has been rough and you guys have
been there for me through it all so I
just want to say thank you guys so much
for that and yeah I want to make sure
that you guys know that because watching
this vlog you might think like oh my god
that's so awesome whatever but like I
mean I literally would not do this
without you guys so thank you thank you
thank you thank you guys so much I love
you and I hope they guys enjoyed the
vlog
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
