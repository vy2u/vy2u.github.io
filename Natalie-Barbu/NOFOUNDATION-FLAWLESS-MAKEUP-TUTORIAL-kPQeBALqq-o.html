going to keep this intro very very short
because I'm extremely sore throat and I
really don't feel good at all so I don't
want to talk that much just because my
throat was very sore I am filming a very
natural makeup look I this was inspired
by Disney Perkins she just films one of
these and I kind of put my own twist to
it I will link her original video down
below but I absolutely fell in love with
it when I did it to myself and I have
been wearing this every single day since
I think it's gorgeous it's so super
light for summer and it is absolutely no
foundation which is awesome
just because during the summer you don't
want to really be a wearing a full-face
foundation to be sweat a lot at least I
do so this is the perfect summer light
weight makeup tutorial if you guys are
new here please subscribe I normally
don't sound this quiet my throat just
really really hurts I hope you guys
enjoyed this video please give a thumbs
up if you guys do I love you so much
sorry again for my throat um but please
comment down below if you guys want to
make a tutorial and any other videos you
want to see be sure to subscribe to my
blog channel Sunday blogging I'll have
that link down below and I'll see ya -
so I am first starting out with my Mario
Badescu rose water spray this is my
favorite way to prime my face and I am
spraying it all over and then waiting
for it to dry I'm then using my Mac
strobe cream this is my all-time
favorite makeup product I have yet to
purchase and I am just applying it on
the high points of my cheek and then
blending it out mainly focusing it there
but if you get it anywhere else that's
fine too because it's just going to go
underneath the concealer and then give
you a really really healthy glow which
is I think will attract so many people
to this product so I just put it on the
bridge of my nose my temples and the
high points of my cheeks and then I'm
going in with this milk makeup
highlighter and this one is like a
purple magnetic color it's really really
really really pretty love it I'm just
putting it on the high points of my
cheek and then blending it out with a
buffing brush just because I don't want
any harsh lines at all now making sure
that my strobe cream
the milk makeup is blended and also
going in with a concealer that is about
my skin tone I don't want to go too
light because we aren't using foundation
so I want to this to look natural and
not like I have white under my eyes so
I'm just applying to concealer
underneath my eyes on my forehead the
bridge of my nose and on my chin after
you look like you have a bunch of mud on
your face you are going to take a
buffing brush for a Beauty Blender and
buff it out I like to tap it and then
once I'm done capping it and it's pretty
well into my skin I like blending it out
there are no harsh line since we aren't
using foundation and we don't have
anything on under the concealer besides
the highlighter totally fine to kind of
blend it out in circular motion but if
you covered any pimples
I would definitely pass those because if
you blend it and it's just not going to
conceal your pimples so I had one kind
of on my mouth and I just tapped that
into it then I'm going with a Beauty
Blender and making sure I have zero
harsh lines I don't want my concealer to
be visible that's the whole point of
this tutorial to make sure that you have
flawless looking skin and not like you
have foundation or concealer on at all
now onto the best part of this makeup
tutorial is the highlighters taking Mac
soft and gentle and I am just putting
that on the high points of my cheek and
also on the bridge of my nose
this will definitely make sure that the
highlight underneath pops a lot but do
not worry we are not done this makeup
tutorial has the most highlighter you
have ever seen but trust me I think it
looks really really good and you are
literally glowing
moving on to the second highlighter I'm
using the purple one in the annasophia
glow kit and I am just smiling and
putting it on the apples of my cheeks
but bringing it up to the temple so just
a little bit underneath the snack soft
and gentle highlighter but you're still
blending it all together it's a kind of
look like it's all one color I think it
looks really really pretty
the purple one kind of acts like a blush
but then we're moving on to actual blush
and I am smiling again and simply
putting that underneath and kind of like
a C or like a half u motion I guess and
I think it looks so gorgeous and then
whatever else you have on the brush I
put on my nose on my forehead on my chin
just kind of make you look sunkissed
like you just went to the beach and you
got a little bit sunburned but not too
much obviously I think it makes it look
a lot more natural when you do that
moving on to eyebrows I like using a gel
for this
I feel like pencils and powders make it
look a little too dark for me so I'm
using a soft brown gel and with this I'm
mainly focusing it on the inside of my
eyebrows where the hairs are a lot more
sparse and my eyebrow can I do a good
ombre effects like there are a lot
darker towards the end so I'm focusing
on the inside and then also the outside
just to make it a little longer so I'm
trying to elongate my brows and make
them look more natural using hair like
strokes but we aren't really outlining
them that much just you don't have that
much makeup on so you don't want to have
your eyebrows be too dramatic and then I
am just brushing them out to make sure
that they're all blended and look as
natural as possible then I'm going in
with mascara and you can 100% skip this
step if you want but I like rolling my
lashes and with it definitely relevant a
lot because that is the main point of
this and I'm literally putting like
three coats like maybe a little more but
just a couple coats on my lashes and
that's it just enough so that the curl
stays but not enough to make it look
like you have mascara on
that is it for this look I really hope
you guys enjoy super glowy I love it and
I'll see you guys next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
