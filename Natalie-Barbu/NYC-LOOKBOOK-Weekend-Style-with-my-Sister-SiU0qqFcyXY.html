it's been waiting for you
yuck welcome to New York
welcome to know you
yo yo
hey everyone it is Natalie here and I
have a super exciting video for you guys
I went to New York City this weekend and
I just wanted to film kind of a new york
city look book because I feel like New
York is so unlike the rest of the
country and the world is general and it
just has a style of its own so I kind of
made my style and I wore it in New York
City pretty self-explanatory but the one
thing I love about New York is how every
single person is so stylish and that
sounds super super superficial because
it's like why do you like New York
justice people look good no and it's not
even like everything is my style their
butts like everyone has their own unique
style like everyone in New York City
dresses their way no matter what like if
there's so many different styles there
and I really really love it like just
walking down the city I saw so many
people and show me different types of
things and I got so much inspiration
from it so I was really excited about
that and tennis the first time filming
is my older sister I went with my sister
today or today this weekend and I sent
to film her outfits too I'm about to do
a blog post on the look that I wore this
past weekend just a bunch of books that
i wore if you want me to a new york hall
possibly with my sister cuz she got more
things with me then thumbs this video up
and let me know if you guys want us to
do more videos together maybe like a
sister style swap or something now our
styles are pretty similar I don't know
just throwing out ideas for you guys let
me know what you guys want to see next
and let's just get you to this video hey
guys so this half it was worn on the
first day of my trip and I work to
Central Park and that was when I was and
where I film this and I just thought it
was stupid pretty and really easy and I
weren't in the airport too so it was
just a really casual outfit and I
11 is a pop of color with Sid to him so
I really love all white shoes and my
shoes are some gaps my jean shorts are
actually from gap as a while and my
shirt is from a well i'm not too sure
where my necklace is from but my
cardigan shawl thing is from urban
outfitters and my backpack is from
target and as you can tell i seriously
love this backpack i will be wearing it
with all my outfits this trip and also i
was going to scared someone's going to
steal something from it but luckily no
one day
Oh
if you guys don't know New York hot dogs
are my life and I love so my sister's
outfit was also warned obviously the
first date so she went to the airport
and stuff too and hers it's actually
super cute it's lost overalls from yes
and her shoes orders homers you know in
her shirt I really like him compared
like a 70s flowy shirt with her overalls
cuz I feel like it's really not common
to do and yeah her shirt is from made
well I believe I'm actually not a
hundred percent sure but I will lead
everything in the downbar below if you
guys want to check it out and I'll leave
her social network stuff as well I
believe she's private on things but you
know you could always requester
this is actually my sister is very first
time filming so I'm pretty proud of her
I think she did a really good job us on
the camera guys don't you think so and
some video up if you think she should
have her own fashion blog so the next
outfit is actually one of my favorite
ones I got asked to take a picture at
brandy melville for their tea marketing
group so i guess i'll see like flip the
team gemzar and fun facts halfway
through the day his hat off and put it
away for good because it was so when me
I don't know why doth so windy all of a
sudden and my hat just kept flying off
and was really annoying and I just gave
up on wearing the hat even though it's
so so cute as you can tell I'm wearing
the same backpack as my purse cuz i wear
with all my outfits so my hat is from
nordstrom my dress is from revolve
clothing and I don't know where my
necklaces from and then my booties I
thought were super cute cuz they're a
light color and to kind of make it more
summery with the all elastic just let me
know what your favorite part of New York
is I think soho is my fav you watch me
so for my sisters chocolate this one was
super cute she actually bought it today
before when we went shopping in New York
so she actually didn't bring this with
her but it's basically all free people
so if you guys can't tell it's free
people I love it I think so cute and I'm
gonna be borrowing it sometime soon her
shoes are I believe from Nordstrom and
I'm not a hundred percent sure her
shorts and her shirt our country people
and it was forty percent off sale items
so we spent three hundred and fifty
dollars which I know is a lot all
together but we it would have been over
eleven hundred dollars if we bought it
all full price so you know what I
consider that she'll I'm not saying that
to brag I'm saying that to say that we
got a good deal so please do not leave
any mean comments down below
thank you in the moon enough to God
right okay and I want to play a little
game I guess not really a game but
comment down below how old you think my
sister looks I'm not going to tell you
if she's young or old just comment down
below to say how old she looks because I
think it would be really funny because
she normally does not look her age but
yeah comment down below and tell me how
old you think she is oh and hey this guy
12 seen the videos oh hey that night we
went to the restaurant called the lion
which is known for celebrities always
going there unfortunately we didn't see
any but we decided to dress up so my
dress is from Topshop and it is so so so
cute i'm in love with this dress I
really just love the patterns and these
place to it and just how I've never seen
anyone wear it before my shoes are some
shoe mint and they're this really pretty
blue color and I'm literally obsessed
with the solvent that piece of curl but
sticking out of my head is really
annoying me but it's okay because that
alpha is on point my sister's outfit is
from three people I believe it's all
free people so her dress and her
cardigan or free people and the bralette
she's wearing it's free people so yeah
that's kind of fun we're kind of like a
free people loving Sam and her shoes are
Sam at alone don't forget to come down
