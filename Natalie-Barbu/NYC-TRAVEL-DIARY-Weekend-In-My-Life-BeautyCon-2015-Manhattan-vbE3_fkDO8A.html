hey everyone it is Natalie here and
today I have a video for you guys of my
trip in New York and I already have a
vlog on my channel so go check that out
if you haven't already but I kind of
filmed a day in my life but it actually
was two days in my life so it's just the
day of beauty con and then also when i
left new york city and i'm so excited i
was so excited to fill this video for
you guys so i really hope that you guys
like it let me know we think in the
comments below and also let me know
other videos you want me to film because
i really want to film what you guys have
want me to film and if you guys want i

below that were included in this video I
had so much fun filming and make sure to
follow me on instagram because that's
where i have like a ton of new york city
pictures so i will have my lip instagram
down below and right here if you guys
want to follow me on that yeah let's
just get started into this video so
welcome to the start of my day in New
York and I always start off with
breakfast and what especially when I'm
out of town I try to get a really good
breakfast and then after that I just
headed out the door I really like to
just get a start on my day and not waste
any time so after I got ready in 8
breakfast we just hopped in the uber and
actually this was not an uber it was
steph's driver that sounds kind of weird
but then we ended up in beautycon and it
was so crowded but it was so much fun
and I didn't really get to meet that
many of you guys but I loved loved loved
beautycon then we ended up at a thai
restaurant and it was steps first time
having thai food thai food is basically
my favorite food ever so if you guys
have any recommendations on what to get
and let me know but i gotta get the top
thai tea and i always get chicken pad
thai that's definitely my thing and
steph loved it so i'm so happy then we
just headed off and we decided to kind
of explore new york and walk back to the
hotel and just film and take pictures
and
yeah so that's basically what we did we
decide to show you guys our outfits so
step is just wearing a white long sleeve
shirt and a flannel wrapped around her
waist and we got these puff balls in
topshop you can definitely see that when
we bought those in the vlog and then her
wild flower case which is so cute and
then my alpha is a cape and dress in my
cape is actually from Windsor and I love
it because I love kind of t-shirt
dresses with high socks and I thought
the Cape added a lot of elegance to it
so I really really loved it my bag is
also from Windsor and it basically holds
everything and I also had a wild flower
case but yeah this Cape is basically my
favorite thing ever and it really did
keep me warm then we headed up to our
hotel and we stayed at the omni hotel
and we headed up to the rooftop which
was absolutely beautiful and we had
another little photo shoot so this time
i am wearing a cropped sweater and a
plaid skirt but my shoes are from
windsor and i love heals with socks so i
will link everything it down below but
yeah my shoes are from windsor and then
we are girls so we decided to take like
a million selfies and then after that we
headed to starbucks and we just did this
to edit videos and just to upload
because starbucks Wi-Fi was faster but
if you want to see what dilemma happened
check out steph slog it's actually
really funny so yeah I'm not going to
tell you but just to check out her blog
yeah I just get a lot of work done there
and then we went to a diner and I know
you're probably like coffee then diner
but yes we did we waited a couple hours
so wasn't all right away but we just
relax at the hotel and the Steiner was
so good you guys I keep 2 i'm gonna keep
telling you but watch the vlog to see it
because it was amazing and then after
that we headed starbucks again because
it was freezing outside and we needed to
edit videos so i needed to pick me up
and I decided that I want to keep
filming so the next day we just went to
soho and we got brunch with a couple
youtubers and i will link them all down
below it's steph obviously hannah ashton
and taylor across so I will link them
all down below but this place was so
cute and we just took so many pictures
and yeah here's kind of like
behind the scenes of youtubers that was
really cool to include this so I hope
you guys liked it but yeah I just kind
of show you want to show you guys what
my life was like this weekend and I
thought steps off it was just the cutest
thing so you know just filming everyone
but then thanks to step for filming me
because she is great at filming and
youtubers kind of understand each other
that's always good but I am just wearing
a scarf from Windsor it kept me warm and
a leather jacket from free people this
was my last day I was actually getting
ready to leave in a few minutes so it
was really sad but I was so happy that I
got to meet everyone and I was so
excited just that like I got to meet
other youtubers because it's really nice
putting a face to the screen I guess and
then I decided to head it to the airport
and it was so sad because I Love New
York and just like that in back in North
Carolina I had the best trip ever and it
was so much fun like didn't want to come
back but I knew I had to but I loved
meeting everyone and just meeting other
youtubers and I had such a fun time
