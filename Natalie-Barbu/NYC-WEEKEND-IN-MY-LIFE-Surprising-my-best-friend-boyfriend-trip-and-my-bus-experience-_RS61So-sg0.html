exciting vlog I'm just I'm happy very
happy person right now so this morning I
give you a rundown of my day because I'm
starting this vlog very late it's 4:30 I
woke up super early went to a fly bar
class
it's that flywheel they also have bar
classes so I did one of those super hard
I've never done a lower class before but
it kicked my butt and then apply I'm
like looking really gross right now but
anyway it's then I went to class then I
went home showered and then I walked
like a mile and a half to get to my
waxing appointment and I wanted to walk
because it's literally 77 degrees
outside today and sunny and perfect and
that's why I'm so happy they walked the
mile and a half there because it was I
mean the weather come on and then I did
that and then I walked all the way to a
coffee shop and I got so much work done
so I edited my video and I basically
have a whole spreadsheet for living in
LA for the summer so I don't know I
think I've talked about this in a video
before but I'm 99% sure I'll be living
in LA this summer before my real job
starts so I'm so excited about that and
I love to meet any of you guys that live
in LA I'm trying to find like an
apartment and I'm trying to find like if
it's better to just uber during the
summer which would be hella expensive or
if I should rent a car but I'm under 25
so you know like it's hard to rent a car
then there's this app called Turo which
is like a cheaper car rentals it's kind
of like Airbnb for cars so that's there
and then I'm gonna have all my code it's
like my affiliate links or whatever down
below so I get as much of a discount as
I can if you guys use them I think I
might just air B&amp;amp;B it if I don't find
someone to sublease from because for air
bv it comes with pots pans comforter
sheets towels all that stuff so I don't
have to buy them there so thinking
Airbnb might be the best way and Airbnb
does have long term rentals so I think
that's what I'm gonna do but use my
Airbnb code down below please so if you
guys have never used Airbnb code like I
mean I will love you forever if you just
use my code that is down below I know so
many of you guys have already so mwah
thank you love you so I'm trying to like
come up with all of my expenses I have
my sub partment sublease here in Raleigh
so that's like off my back so I don't
have to worry about that
um I was trying to calculate like food
gas everything like so much that goes
into moving to a new city especially
when it's short term because like you're
trying to think of the best way when
it's only like two three months like for
example a gym membership where am I
gonna do that because I need to have a
gym there so just random things like
that and I just got so much stuff done
them just I mean if you guys can tell I
am very happy but the exciting part
about slog is that tonight I'm going to
New York and yes you guys are probably
like Natalie do you live there like are
you paying grace rent no I'm not going
there because I am surprising her for
her 23rd birthday
this whole month I was like oh my gosh
I'm so sad like I really wish I could go
I'm so sad like I wish I could go to
your birthday really want to go and she
was like oh I know so Colin and I were
just my boyfriend art surprising her and
we are taking an overnight bus so grace
I love you because I'm going on a nine
hour long bus for you an overnight bus -
that leaves from Raleigh that goes
straight to New York
and it was $70 round-trip so we're
coming back Sunday night coming like
arriving Monday morning so cuz I did
because I've never really surprised
anyone before and no one's ever
surprised me so if you guys are my
friends at watching this
my birthday's coming up in April okay
guys that is so much later and I have
not long today but I am all packed for
New York it literally took me like 10
minutes to pack though so I fact like
right after I turn the camera off last
time helen is here and we are going to
New York together and I'm just so happy
and I'm like wide awake right now which
is an issue I need to be asleep I think
I'm just gonna take a bunch of nyquil
though not a bunch the recommended
serving size that's what I'm gonna take
I am very curious to see how this will
turn out because it's not a bus station
like I said it's literally Heat the guy
on the phone I called to verify where it
was and he said it's right next to a
sick Co gas station on a street next to
it so like
we are waiting at the gas station
but currently
11:04 supposed to come in ten minutes
so really hope it's not late all right I
took nyquil and melatonin and it's like
really messing with my head and making
me feel like really lightheaded
so I'm hoping that I'm helping my
kitchen stuff
we have
two hours
and 15 minutes left now I look
it's two hours 30 minutes
every name is
anyone shops yeah
my thought so far
incredibly uncomfortable
got any so cheap so
you get what you pay for but honestly
from Raleigh like a plane ticket isn't
that much more expensive
like it's like
little over double what up 180 beside
seven days but
like a birthday present
like right now
never
[Laughter]
me like ringing in you guys so it is a
lot later and I just wanted a Nike
clearance outlet here in New York and
it's like in Queens so it was kind of
far away but Collin really wanted to go
like literally he couldn't stop talking
about the Nike clearance out that outlet
I can't speak because I'm too tired and
it's got back to Grace's I showered and
I feel so much cleaner because that buzz
like it was really dirty and I just felt
very disgusting afterwards like I didn't
chat like I just needed to shower so
it's really late right now it is
currently four o'clock and we still
haven't really done anything besides
that so Collin it's like resting he's
like dead like completely out so I am
going to wake him to tell him to get his
lazy butt up so that we can go and eat
some cookie dough because they just
really want to go to Manhattan and I
want to eat some dough she's all I want
so that is I think what we're gonna do
we're just gonna head to the city get
some dessert get some dinner and then
head back so it's not gonna be a very
fun day but grace was so surprised and
like she really had no idea and I had
her friend Kayla is here also so she I
was like I don't want to intrude on your
guys's plans because obviously like you
would know you were not expecting me so
you go out you do your thing so they're
already in the city and we're gonna meet
up there afterwards but we were just
both so tired and I have like a headache
so tonight sleep it's gonna be really
really really nice it is the next
morning and then I am still at Grace's
house because I'm just gonna
get ready for the day I really like
coming to New York just because I feel
like I've seen literally everything I
need to see so like I can just be here
and be way more chill like I don't have
to constantly fill my schedule with
things to jail because it's not like I
haven't been here before you know and
it's not like I'm not coming back let's
be real I just got any greatest news
literally ever so you guys I am
officially moving to LA for the summer
so I'm so I should do like a whole video
like I'm just like announcing this
honestly but anyways I'm going to a
light for the summer and I feel like
it's not that big of a deal to some of
you because you're like okay it's just
for the summer but like for me that is
such a big deal and I'm so excited and
literally I just have to thank God
number one and because like all of this
is possible because of him like a
hundred percent the fact that I'm given
this opportunity to have chance to do
what I love doing and do my work and
move it to Los Angeles California have
the means to do that have just like
being in this industry that I'm in right
now like every having the summer like
having a job that allows me to take that
summer before I start off to do this
like I'm just like over the moon thank
you thank you thank you Lord for
allowing me for giving us this
opportunity like it's 100% for him
whatever sent for him is what I'm doing
this week I'm just I'm so happy I booked
my place already so like it's mine the
guy was like yeah there's like other
people looking at those dates so like
honestly like I would book soon if I
were you and oh my gosh I'm just so
happy it's a such an amazing location I
needed to come on here and see that I'm
about to do my makeup and get ready then
I have to take a photo for a company and
then I have to go out and explore and
then tonight is Grace's birthday party
so I'm so excited so we're gonna get
ready we're gonna go to the city a
little earlier so we can take some
pictures and today is just one of the
greatest days I'm in my favorite place
my favorite people and I just got the
best news ever literally turns on
Netflix right now and I'm about to watch
and I know she went to hell because to
get me in the LA mood so late oh my god
a little later and that Paul and I are
off to the city so we are waiting for
the bus actions like New York Grace's
place and we're gonna go get lunch I am
so hungry I really want to go to like
bye Khloe or something like that because
it's a vegan restaurant but Collin
probably does not like it so I was like
I'll pay for your meal you try it
he's like very anti vegan but it's
actually like not cold at all today I'm
just wearing light denim jacket and like
a long-sleeve shirt and it's not cold so
I'm just excited for the day and even
though I didn't really get that much
sleep like I feel very energetic so
hopefully I don't crash so I'm
definitely gonna need like a coffee or
two but yeah Grayson's birthday that
means so much fun I have the pressed
freezer II
oat milk latte
all as well this is so good we were just
very happy I made : go to buy Chloe
would say which is the vegan place like
I said
I wasted my time Oh : cries
and too much sauce
he liked that he didn't love it but
culturally he liked it yeah there's no
catch up in his being so like
I love my Kamali
I come
yawning
we are starting off as the next vlog at
Shake Shack and I will discuss the whole
really being vegan thing obviously
there's nothing being in here besides
the fries and I'm getting a hamburger so
it's gonna be like the implant mates at
home when I'm cooking tried to make the
intimates when I'm out but I'm not gonna
restrict myself because I love myself
and I want to eat what I want to eat it
so
do everything in moderation but try to
eat sideways that possible so it was
like one of my meals today is not like
the whole rest of the trip I have been
100% vegan so like I've been fine you
know but like today I just really really
really want to change that and Colin
never had Shake Shack before and we're
exploring Brooklyn so I just really
wanted to take him here and show him the
burger place this dance it's literally
my favorite it's like a million times
better than in and out like anyone can
quote me on that it's so much better
yeah so that I guess means landing
myself really have to but anyway today
we are just exploring Rockland so we're
going on a self-guided and walking the
floor up for fun night before our bus
leaves and I allocate and we're again
gonna get like no good sleep that's
totally fine so that's what we're gonna
do last night's Grace's birthday party
thing and it was a lot of fun I am NOT a
going-out person though so I had one
drink all night at dinner and I really
regret it
$17 believably ridiculous I think so
that kind of soft but sex I was gonna
lotta fun recent one which was the most
important part and I'm just so happy was
here to like celebrate with her like all
of her friends and
there's like a really cool experience
going out in the city but we are at the
Brooklyn Bridge Park and it's so cute
I've never been to this part of
different port I know but it's so nice I
want to get a photo Here I am wearing my
sweatshirt that I wore on the bus so it
probably smokes back but it has a hood
on it my Athleta jacket he be warm I
just got these joggers from Nike they
were twenty dollars twenty percent off
or thirty percent off at the clearance
store and a very good deal and then my
rain booty is because it's raining today
so here's the look
so I was trying to take a cute picture
and I wanted my sunglasses in it cuz I
know how makeup on I take my sunglasses
out of my bag and I'm like undoing them
they freakin break these are my second
ones of the key sunglasses that break
and I don't understand like there's such
crappy quality look at how they broke
and they were like in a case this is so
annoying
maybe I can still
I can like superglue no no these are $60
sunglasses yeah yeah my face I'll do it
like this these shoes were made for the
New York streets I love Brooklyn I want
to live here I just love it so much
right by a bunch of drips like in
Chinatown I think that's where we are
but waiting for the bus this is
definitely not a luxurious whatsoever
like I don't think I would ever do this
again it was a cheap way to get here so
and I had fallen so that's why I felt
very safe but like I would never do this
by myself
it takes very long it's uncomfortable it
smells Colin said that the bathroom was
maybe the nastiest thing has ever seen
in his entire life so I'm thanking God
that I never had to go inside of it but
a really really cheap way to get to the
city so if you aren't interested they do
it like all up and down the East Coast
so definitely try 70 bucks for
everything you cannot beat that but yeah
we're just waiting into the bus and who
knows if it's gonna be late or early or
anything like that but I had so much fun
in the city and I didn't vlog like too
much but I really hope that you guys
enjoyed this weekend of my life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
