today I'm filming a makeup tutorial and
I have not failed to make it tutorial in
floor ever just because I'm a lot I like
fashion a lot more than I like makeup
but of course i still like makeup and i
just really wanted to film one intend to
film a couple one to a couple every
single season and now it's summer so I
thought it would be perfect to a natural
summer look so I'm totally into the
no-makeup look and this technically is
not like no makeup cuz you can obviously
tell I'm wearing makeup but it's just
really natural and pretty and I think
that light makeup is so much nicer for
summer because it kind of looks like
you're not wearing that much but you
still are wearing some makeup that like
basically just enhances your beauty and
is not dramatic or anything like that so
that is what i did today and i'm going
to show you guys how you can get white
teeth and a lot of people have been
asking recently how i get white teeth
and i actually have not been really
editing my photos that much lately and
um I just wanted to show you guys what I
use to get white teeth see this is not
edited so it's a video so but um I have
been using dazzle pro smile pack 7-day
whitening system and yours will see this
in the video but basically it's just for
seven days but that's basically all I
need because I can keep up with it
otherwise just by brushing my teeth I
mean that's like the easiest way to get
white teeth but I always kind of try
using a little bit of teeth whitening
methods every now and then just to kind
of keep them extra white and so I've
been using this dazzle pro 7 day
whitening system and this is basically
what it looks like I showed how I
applied it in the video but it comes
with an upper and lower packet so this
is for the upper teeth this is lower
teeth pretty self-explanatory and it
already has the whitening gel in it and
only used to I think like three times
it's already like pretty white but I
really have been liking them and i will
link them down below if you guys want to
check it out Oh basically what you do is
just put them on and then leave them on
for 20 minutes and then your teeth
basically get white after it my teeth
are definitely my favorite thing to have
but during summer just because obviously
I like having my teeth year-round summer
everything is more bright and glistening
and you just kind of want to look your
best especially the tan skin and white
teeth that is so so pretty I think
and let me know what you guys think of
this makeup tutorial and just let's get
into the video
