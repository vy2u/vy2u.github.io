of I didn't really count how many ways
but a bunch of different ways to wear a
denim shirt my denim sure is my favorite
piece of clothing or at this moment it's
really been in for about a year right
now I wear the little that I wear it a
lot oh and by the way I don't think I
mentioned this in the video my dad I'm
sure it's from j.crew they don't have it
now
like as in right right now the exact one
but they definitely have a denim shirt
or maybe well does with just like the
same company because they have one every
season it's just like a different one
has like one extra pocket or like the
pockets on the left instead of the right
like something it's very very small so
it's pretty much the same exact thing
and yeah that's my favorite piece of
clothing so I'm showing you a bunch of
different ways to wear it and like a
bunch of looks yeah Ellie I didn't end
jewelry because joy I feel like is a
very personal thing so whatever you feel
works in with it works like I'm pretty
sure that you guys would know socially
cuz it's such a personal thing like
jewelry is very like it kind of
expresses who not who you are but like
it expresses a lot about a person what
do worry they wear so that's where I
left jewelry entirely up to you guys
tell me which look is your favorite tell
me which look is your least favorite
tell me which log you actually would
wear in public
so tell me a bunch of things and post
like a picture of your seller like email
me a picture like Twitpic me a picture
of yourself wearing one of the outfits
or wearing an outfit thing you made with
a denim shirt or anything denim for that
matter so I really hope you enjoyed this
video I enjoyed making it so yeah thank
you so now let's get started
okay so this first look is
denim-on-denim so I have my denim shirt
and I have it with American Eagle capris
your just slim capris and then I tucked
it my shirt in and I put it with this
super cute belt um I have some gold
studs on the side of it and this is from
j.crew I have this mention in my back to
school video anyways and then I have
some really cute oxford skills on just
to make the look a bit more polished and
a bit more put together but fun and edgy
like so cute the whole book together and
these are a BCBG new generation I'm sure
you can find shoes just like this at any
other store like Steve mad and I know
self-solving like a bunch of other
stores awesome but these are definitely
a good pair to buy because you can put
these with so many different outfits
I've worn these a bunch of times and
that is my whole outfit
okay so this is more like dressy this is
to kind of dress up your denim shirt
okay these shorts are from Urban
Outfitters I just got these we can
Banana Republic random hall or whatever
I'm outside in my backyard anyways I
thought is there these were only twenty
dollars on sales was really excited
because I kept I really wanted these for
a long time and they just they look like
a skirt if you're like legs are together
because they're so flowy and everything
and they have a bunch of different
colors and they're just like silk
material and it's just I these are one
of my favorite booty shorts and then I
tucked in my denim shirt this cute belt
it's kind of like okay and I don't
really know what the color is so like I
don't know but it's a really cute like
brownish nude so let's like mulch that
sounds gross but it's really cute and
it's just skinny I got to set Drake
through and then my shoes are my
favorite part of this outfit they're
extremely vintage if you guys can see
they're having a yellow creamish she
with and then like the cute blue on the
wedge and these I have she's Fendi I got
this in the Bahamas on my cruise but
they were like 90% off nine zero and
like they were who's such a good deal
which is because in those back rooms
like see the shoes and these are the
only size and they kicked me and me my
sister and my mom I'll share shoes and
they were like super cheap for a Fendi
because findings like a high-end
designer but they were so cute like
they're my favorite shoes because
they're so vintage and like in the
Bahamas there's no tax or whatever like
that and now I'm moving on to the next
one
is a way to kind of dress down your like
fancy skirt this is a lace skirt from BP
Nordstrom on the junior section it's
just a really cute it's not super tight
but it's not loose either and it has
lace on it and I really like it I mean I
was having an eye on this and got this
like a year ago so most likely you will
find it but any fancy skirt kind of lacy
who will do for this look and so
obviously I just tucked in my denim
shirt again and then I added these
grunge edgy boots these are from
although these are throwing my favorite
shoes in my entire closet I wear these
almost every day not really but I wear
these a lot especially during the fall
with my jeans or a dress or something
there's so edgy and just to look like
with the denim shirt and the edgy boots
it really dresses down the lacy skirt
but makes it so pretty look at me
it makes it just so like looks good you
know it's not like what the heck is that
girl wearing it's like oh my gosh that
girls wearing outfit so cute and
actually when I bought these boots
finding some wearing this skirt I wasn't
wearing this shirt but I was wearing the
skirt and I my mom was like oh that
looks good together and I'm like it
looks really good with this denim shirt
too so this is actually one of my
favorite outfits I'm probably gonna be
saying this forever yo try on but the
seriously it is one of them so now
moving on to the next one
okay so this is my denim shirt
unbuttoned obviously sleeves are still
rolled and everything but it's just an
unbuttoned denim shirt with a floral
romper you can wear with a floral dress
anything floral underneath I saw it on
who what where calm if you guys don't
know what that website is you guys
should definitely check it out I'll link
it in the bottom bar below it's awesome
but anyways um they said that floral and
like army stuff was really in and I
figured this isn't army but I mean it's
pretty close so it's just really like
chill or whatever but it's very floral
too floral romper I got this at a little
boutique where I live so you won't find
this anywhere and I got it like two
years ago so definitely won't find it
anywhere but anything Florida will go
and then I'd wear it with my like creme
tongs mine are kind of dirty actually
they're really dirty but um they're just
cream tongs and this look is so chilled
like it's like I bore this hole to
school when I was going on going for a
review session for my exams so I
definitely is a very chill block but it
looks so cute like I really really like
it I'll definitely be wearing it again
but yeah I just really like it and I
hope you guys like it too now on to the
next one
okay so this smoke is very wintry I know
my other ones are pretty summery /
floral but this is definitely a winter
look so I'm wearing the my denim shirt
with long like sleeves I unrolled them
but I just rolled it one just because I
don't like if it's just like out like
all the way but it's so long as you can
tell and I'm gonna tuck it in or
anything it just like hangs loose and I
put this the blue and gray vest from
Banana Republic I got this last
maternity look at this material it just
before in New York probably don't have
anymore but any vest you can get like
any navy blue or black or gray vest is
super super thick even not super thick
that's with me fine so scratch that but
any dress would be fine and then just
navy blue jeans obviously these are
seven for all mankind I have one of
these in my other videos and these argh
yes you are seeing color find these are
black boots and I am wearing navy blue
navy blue black can be mixed and pastor
I don't really care what anybody says I
think they look really good these are
riding boots I got these at Dillard's I
think there are cuz these a few years
ago so he doesn't think won't find these
anymore but any black riding boots would
be perfectly fine like you really don't
have to mimic my outfit completely any
black ones are fine so these are super
cute and they're like faux leather or
whatever and then like a little buckle
right here and they don't really have a
seal to the little little baby heel but
they make a lot of noise when you walk
but um but yeah that's my final look and
I hope you enjoyed it
so guys
