so I just woke up and then went to the
nail salon right away after I like
already and stuff and I got these babies
I have never had these nails before I
really really love the way they look
kind of hard getting used to not gonna
lie I was like trying to get my credit
card out to pay for them and I was like
like it could not get them out it was so
embarrassing he was like be careful with
those
he was like with you and with other
people it was like I know they're like
my own little weapons like I can poke
someone's eye balls out with these so
don't mess with me guys I was like
taking some pictures so it's like maybe
oh this one cuz I really want to get a
picture with my nails the only dilemma
is I always like draw on my snapchat
stories if you guys don't follow me on
snapchat here's my shoutout but yeah I
always like draw on them like right and
curses on them like make them look all
pretty and now I can't I like tried and
it literally looked at crap I was like
oh my gosh I can't do it anymore so I'm
just gonna have to type for the next two
weeks that I have these because I'm
assuming these lasts for like two weeks
but yeah I really love them love the
color
umm I don't know what color it is it's a
gel so I got gel so that they don't chip
I like scratching myself and like I'm
obsessed with that noise like I like
some you really hate that noise and I'm
love it like every hard surface I will
encounter you better believe that I will
be like oh focused camera like tap you
know like I'm definitely going to be
using these to my full advantage so this
is the makeup of the day I'm thinking of
doing a makeup look on this cuz I've
been doing this for a couple days in a
row so I kind of want to do like
everyday winter foundation makeup 14 you
know really really love the way like the
highlight catches the light and
everything like that my hair just some
second day groats hair I guess I didn't
vlog yesterday I'm really sorry about
that I really didn't do much but I just
kind of forgot my camera everywhere I
went and then I was like you know what
today's gonna be a break day and then I
didn't even upload so tomorrow yesterday
was just like a bad bad day for vlogs
and bring YouTube outfit of the day so

Uptown Charlotte so if any guys from

it actually looks a lot cooler than like
if you see the big picture doesn't look
that cool but like just sitting and
focusing on these staircases it looks
pretty cool we took some pictures up
here I don't know you know what this is
I guess it's like a place to eat lunch
