most of you guys know both of us by now
human in a ton of my videos we have an
exciting announcement for you guys so
you probably remember pika be looted and
we migrated is the website that I've
talked about multiple times and we have
the big launch last year or a little
over a year ago and it would be a
community that we had set up an online
community for girls so because it was
doing so well we actually ended up
taking a little break to just pray about
the future direction of the site we
didn't want to get too over our heads
that wasn't meaningful or that it was a
wasn't from lemoore and so we really
pretty much direction and we're really
really excited about what we're
launching this year 2017 we have a bunch
of new features we have something
similar and really really stoked about
it and so because it was doing so well
we actually ended up taking a little
break to just pray about this new
direction of the site we didn't want to
get so over our heads that wasn't
meaningful or that it was it wasn't from
the Lord and so really pretty left
direction and was really really excited
about what we're launching this year
2017 we have a bunch of new features you
have something for work and really
really stoked about it this does not
have to do with my youtube channel
specifically this is just something that
I'm going to be doing every other
Saturday of the month on here and every
other Saturday of the month on her blog
creatively ke kaam will have everything
went down below I also wanted to
introduce a lot of my subscribers to
becoming rude is because I just feel
like it's a community for all of us to
come together all of us to get
encouragement it's not just I don't
exclude any good people or anything like
that so it's thought it'd be great to
already use my platform and introduce
you guys to what becoming rooted is so
we can rid is encouraging immunity for
girls we just felt like the world's full
of so much negativity and we wanted to
create a safe space where we could ask
your prayer requests if you have any
prayer chain that we're launching this
year that we're really excited about so
you guys know that you are being prayed
over if you are being thought of and we
hear you and we try to respond all of
our request might pick up a little bit
because the time to do a little
overloaded with them but we are so
excited to continue that amazing feature
but we also have to launch of a
brand-new your discussion forum which is
a way to create community amongst one
another on the site and we have a lot of
international followers on Natalie's
blog and on that was channel and we all
have a lot of international followers on
our become inverted site so we've got to
be a great way to create community and
what's everyone of all different walks
of life and some of the discussion forum
is brand-new and we started some topics
but create your own topics you get to
become a member now becoming rigid it's
all frayed so we're not going to ask for
any money we're not going to give you
like a ton of email spam no you're not
about back to me we hate when we attend
emails and we don't like knowing your
subscription so we understand you guys
if you can sign up with facebook Julie
it's so easy connect to Facebook through
google like you have a gmail or is no
sign of any other email and it's going
to be in the top right corner website
you'll see it down below we'll also have
just fun interactions of like you can
ask you a you can asking that anything
you can ask the public prayer request if
you're comfortable with that so our
community can be praying and blowing
each other up every single day whereas
me Natalie will only be posting new
content every Saturday it's just a way
that we can interact as a day without
having to create new content all the
time because we also have our own
individual like I am individual website
now there's room channel and so it
becomes a little bit overloaded for us
but we wanted to create interaction so
really excited about it on the internet
on YouTube or any types of vlogs you
can't really interact with the people on
the process because I'm pretty syllabus
and then I'm putting it out to you guys
but with this website it's more of a
live like you post something and will
respond to it versus just you watching a
video and relieving a comment that may
or may not get answered yes so I feel
like I love how more interactive attend
at how I will be able to interact with
you guys in a more personal level I
don't think about the converted it is
biblically based if the Christian was
right but you don't have to be Kristen
to get something out of it it's a
community is mostly to just encourage
one another and for each other up so
please don't let that discourage you
from checking it out like we respect
your opinion and we love to people from
all walks of life like we don't have
just burst in print that's not you know
that's not who you are we we believe in
loving everybody and I wonder where
they're at so it is the Christian site
our foundation is on the serum Bible and
I'm Felix use it but we will also love
to have you on the website if you and if
you are following a different page if
you build energy sources if you're
curious about we is like please one is
no email at like we'd love to talk to
you about you know our faith in what we
and we have our own email address to
become ingredient that we both check and
so you won't be lining up individually
so there's more lesson a chance of
giving with a higher response and if you
wanted to ask questions about what it
needs to be Christian what it needs to
be efficient as a millennial is what it
needs to be in our culture like walking
efficient like like please comment for
genomics at becoming rooted at you so
that is xsplit all we have to say about
the place rooted we're so soon as long
as guys so please be sure to check it
out I will have it in the downbar below
leave any comments in a discussion forum
on there or if you just won't have any
random questions can leave them as
comments below but be sure to check out
her blog although because we're going to
have a launch on there too and yeah so
it's going to be more into like written
out if you guys like blah better than
videos and that's what also is great
about this is that we are both in our
own element and I'm our video person
that always willing she is always going
to be more of an effort always will be
I'm not very comfortable in front of it
so it's just like works out it's just a
blend and a best of both worlds thing so
I was really hope you guys like this I'm
office burning of the coming in to
playlist on this channel so all of that
stuff will just be on there and I hope
it it's like it the other thing lasting
is like our socials we're actually we
kind of fell to the bar blue blood we
kind of vegetable through the crack of
our Instagram so we're going to be
really really hitting Instagram hard and
our Facebook is doing pretty well so
just continue to like those things for
updates while becoming rooted and
provost not she should not to fall to
the crack again like a good love concert
is it was my bad so we're really sorry
about that astley thank you for sticking
with us and you know understanding that
with your really hard season and their
jewelry and you're really really sorry
about not dating our content as much
they coming we did but we still will you
guys and we still pray for you guys and
we're really excited about the scene
