the start of my vlogs I decided that I
kind of want to vlog once a week I was
going to do four weekly vlogs when I put
everything I do in one week in one blog
let me know if you would rather me do
that I just tried it one week and it was
just really hard to know what to vlog
because I feel like some days I want to
vlog everything and some days I have
nothing to vlog and it's just I feel
like it's kind of choppy like you guys
don't really even know what I'm doing
it's like a ten-minute thing not even in
um something that happens in seven days
so I feel like that's kind of just
honestly kind of pointless for me I
don't know so I decided I think I want
to do one vlog a week maybe more if you
guys like these um
but yeah today I don't have that very
much planned I just wanted to show you
guys what I'm doing on a normal day in
the life of Natalie Barbu here so yeah
that's just kind of one I wanted to let
show you guys but I'm about to get ready
for the day and I think I'm going to
workout first so yeah it's a very gloomy
day here in Charlotte to the North
Carolina
I have literally become so lazy I used
to work out like five times a week and I
haven't worked out regularly and like
the past two weeks yesterday I worked
out or last week I worked out twice and
then the week before that and nothing I
blame my laziness due to not having a
schedule now that I'm on summer I just
don't have a schedule and it honestly
kind of sucks like I don't know what to
do with my day without a schedule so I
think I need to start making one but my
internship is about to start so I think
then I'll start getting back into
everything and I have like the worst
blisters on my feet because I went to
Charleston yesterday and yeah I should
have logged that but I filmed a video
there but uh yeah I went to Charleston
yesterday
oh my gosh my feet like oh thank gosh
they hurt so badly
like literally there's so much pain and
one of my nails like dug into my other
like toe and it's just so bad they hurt
so much so I don't even know if I want
to work out today all right so it looks
like I'm working out as my dogs keep
barking yeah first time to clean my room
or else my mom will kill me so yeah I'm
just gonna say you guys don't wanna play
my
so if you guys guessed that I was going
to the gym well you guessed right
unfortunately I like really don't want
to go to the gym if you guys can't see
it's like raining and gross and the moon
the weather like totally determines my
mood and like my motivation level so
whoa
the weather totally determines my
motivation so when the weather is not
trying to be pretty outside I don't want
to try to do anything at all that whole
day do any of you guys any of you guys
miss me cause like yeah I just saved the
gym the gym was just in my neighborhood
so we're just driving about 0.2 miles
it's just raining outside so not really
down to walk in the rain
yeah so let's see how much I get done I
haven't went down as I said in a while
like hardcore so I don't even know if
I'm gonna stay for like the whole time
that I normally stay I might honestly
even joke like we're just gonna situate
myself okay oh oh my god okay
well this will be interested in
academics
oh my god it is raining so hard I was
like thinking I'm going to the pool
today
I got ready I like showered and did my
makeup today for the day and yeah I got
back from the gym obviously and I made
this very bowl I'm like obsessed with
tasty videos on YouTube or not YouTube I
guess they are on YouTube but on
Facebook everyone shares them and yes
I'm obsessed them so I found this very
bowl or recipe on Facebook and I
actually did not have bananas which I'm
like obsessed with bananas I love
bananas but I didn't have any so I
couldn't put bananas on it but I looked
up like banana substitutes and chia
seeds are one of them so I put chia
seeds instead but yeah everything else
like it looks really really yummy and
I'm excited to try it YUM so it has
strawberry raspberry blackberries um
peanut butter coconut oil almond milk
and Greek yogurt and she is easy so
there's a lot of good things in it it is
a vegan I'm pretty sure I put some extra
fruit on top and I put coconut flakes on
top and then I put agave as my natural
sweetener I'm obsessed with agave so
let's try it Oh flee it's good there's
really good I love the peanut butter in
it oh my gosh
alright I'm gonna shut my camera down so
I can fully enjoy this delicious thing
get even til I don't have bananas in it
guys I am the or slogger
um yeah this is gonna be a two day vlog
first sure um so yeah I think I might
just end the vlog here because so far
what I did today I hung out with my
friend Rachel and I completely forgot to
vlog yeah okay so I am so sorry I am
still getting these used to this and
getting the hang of things aren't you
and the vlog here I have my super cute
adidas shirt on and I did boxer braids I
don't know I really like these I think
like really into these braids for like a
few years now and now all of a sudden
they're popular so I'm like pretty
excited that they're popular again yeah
alright so I will see you guys dorium
good night guys hey guys so this is the
start of stay to the log and it is the
afternoon already but basically I all
I've been doing is playing around with
my camera
it's my DSLR camera so I have been
wanting to just take pictures and be
better at photography I always keep it
on autofocus and I'm trying to get into
manual and like to know what I'm doing
basically in it but so yeah I've been
outside my backyard taking pictures of
my dogs which there's Luigi right there
so this is Luigi introduce yourself and
da Vinci did indeed the Vinci is uh
right there
here he is hi baby he's coming
Oh where's Luigi going oh he's going to
mess around with his brother what he's
doing but yeah so right now my mom's
actually messing around with my camera
the edge needs nothing around with it
right now but homework are you doing
estimating square roots this is my
brother everyone in case no one knew
you've been in a few videos before but
you don't really like being in videos to
you
I am back in my bedroom and I'm just
laying in bed I'm about to start editing
my video that I want to get up tonight
but it's already 5:20 it's probably
gonna take me a while to edit and then
like upload I don't like uploading
things in the middle of the night
because yeah no one's gonna watch it so
yeah can you guys let me know when the
best time and best day is for you guys
to see a video from me so like when's
the best time for me to upload like when
are you guys the most active on YouTube
I've been trying to do like Wednesdays
and set will I've been trying to do
Wednesdays and Saturdays I haven't
really told anyone just because if I
can't commit to Wednesday and Saturday I
don't want you guys to be like hey you
didn't post a video today like today I
might not be able to post a video so I
might have to push it back to tomorrow
but um yeah so I was wondering if you
guys have like ideal days that you guys
like for me to do this summer it might
be better with like having a schedule or
something like that so right now I am
just watching Alicia Marie the logs and
I am obsessed with her vlogs I think
they are my favorite blogs by far hers
and Monica churches Monica churches are
more like mini documentaries like
reality shows that I totally like I
really like and I really like like their
editing and stuff I feel like Alicia
Marie's like you get to know her more I
don't know so it's not like as cool of
editing but it is like more entertaining
I guess I would say I don't know if you
guys feel the same way because right now
I'm just watching her from yesterday and
she's definitely my vlog inspiration but
I'm getting there I'm like really trying
I mean I'm not getting there but like
I'm trying to get there eventually at
one point we'll see how this summer goes
but yeah so let me know in the comments
below what the best days for me to
upload and the best times and like what
time zone you live in cuz if you're just
like 3 o'clock like you might live in
California and 3 o'clock for you is 6
o'clock for me so yeah just let me know
hey guys so I end up editing this video
super quickly it's not like the coolest
editing in the world but it's kind of
more like a music video video like
there's no intro it's just music it's
only 2 minutes long so you should
totally watch that after this because
it's not long at all
it's just an alpha it's one dress for
outfits and I filmed five outfits but on
as I was editing one of the outfits was
so ugly on camera I was like oh I could
not put this in like it was like cute in
person like it didn't look that bad in
person but on camera since you didn't
see like my whole body at one time it
just was not cute and I was like oh my
gosh if I post this I'm gonna lose
subscribers because it's just wasn't
cute but yeah so that's what I did
um it's uploading right now and I show
up to make the thumbnail and then get it
up but it's only 7:15 so I'm definitely
still gonna upload tonight which I'm
really happy because I upload it on a
Wednesday because I think Friday or
Saturday I'm pretty sure Saturday I'm
uploading another video cuz I'm trying
to do like Wednesday Saturdays and then
um I think I'm uploading another video
next Wednesday so I have already like
three videos including the one I'm
uploading a plan um oh and this one what
am I gonna upload this one if I just
upload this one tomorrow
tomorrow or Friday probably tomorrow
night to give some space yeah all right
look this one tomorrow night so yeah I'm
excited I have a lot of videos planned
this summer so you should totally
subscribe and I just look talking to the
camera so I hope you guys don't mind but
yeah so tell me if you guys watched my
video and if you did after this video
