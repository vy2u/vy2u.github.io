gym so that's why my face is like
extremely red and I'm really sweaty but
I just had to film another what I eat in
a day I think I might see one of these
every single month so like one video out
of my 8 that I do a month just because
it got a really good response last time
and I feel like every month have the new
things that like you know like Meg's
like prepping for summer I don't know so
that's why I'm going to start this as
like a little series and right now I am
with Julie again I feel like she should
be in every single one of them since
she's the one that started my first one
we're at her apartment we just went to
the gym at 8 a.m. and now we are making
omelets again so it is similar to last
time with any problems I'll have a
different foods on last night I just
literally eggs every single morning so
yeah that's what we're doing right now
omelet and cooking it looks so good
eggs is obviously tomatoes spinach
peppers onions salt pepper salt pepper
yes and it's in coconut oil
so we are eating omelet and I put an
omelet and I put salsa on it and I also
put some hot sauce and a cup of coffee
some fresh fruit orange juice
and for my coffee I used the almond milk
creamer so it's a little healthier than
regular creamer and Julie is lactose
intolerant also Julie is going to start
a health and travel blog she travels
everywhere how many countries are you
going through the summer um six she went
in six different countries the summer
all over Europe she's going to different
cities in the US she lives in Costa Rica
so definitely I'm going to link that
down below once she starts it and then
I'll probably make an announcement on my
Instagram and on the most recent video
when she starts it so that you guys know
be on the lookout for that and also
she's a help or a food engineering major
and she like knows all about nutrition
so yeah I'm excited for her to start it
okay this is a toast YUM
so one of my favorite ways to stay
hydrated besides drinking normal water
is to drink coconut water so I normally
finish one of these it's a liter of
coconut water in about two days so I
drink a lot of it I think it's just so
so good
it has only good things for you yes it
has sugar but it only it hydrates you so
much there's no sugar added it's natural
it comes straight from a coconut I mean
this is the best and this is my favorite
brand
so for lunch I normally do something
just like a variety of small snack so I
had the avocado mozzarella sandwich that
was earlier in the day so now it's
already three and I'm a little more
hungry so I'm eating another snack but I
try sometimes I'll have like a full
lunch but I just eat little things
throughout the day I also think that's
fine and then I'll have like a bigger
dinner now I am making roasted
cauliflower cauliflower poppers so I
just cut up a head of cauliflower and I
and putting that on a baking pan and I
preheat the oven to 400 degrees and I am
just going to season this with a lot of
salt pepper chilli powder olive oil and
just stick it in the oven and it should
be good it should be a good little snack
and cauliflower has a lot of fiber in it
which is really good I don't think has
any protein but yeah right before it
goes in the oven I have chili powder
salt pepper olive oil and onion powder
and garlic powder I put a bunch of a
random stuff any seasoning I found I
have no idea how this will taste but we
will see it is done it looks really good
it looks super hot it looks so good all
right I'm going to have a bite hopefully
it's not you
mmm-hmm really the literature about it
more chili powder it's not spicy at all
and I was scared I was going to be spicy
but that's good I might get some hot
sauce on so for dinner I am starting off
with an appetizer for how I wait for my
food to cook so I like eating a snack
while I wait for my food
does anyone else do that I feel like
it's not a very good habit but just
being honest with you guys so I love
this fresh salsa from Harris Teeter it's
amazing and I get the sweet onion flavor
and my fridge is very cold and this was
in the back of it so I honestly think
this was like frozen right now but yeah
so I always get this a tortilla chips
and I will show you guys so what I'm
having for dinner once I make is my
dinner is here I know it doesn't look
appetizing I started eating it and then
I forgot to film so I have potatoes and
my seasons of them and I put them in the
oven for about 140 30 minutes 30 minutes
and carrots at 400 degrees and then
after 20 minutes I put the sausage in
and I kept that there for about 15 10 to
15 minutes because this is chicken
sausage so it has a lot less fat and
also has bell peppers in it so I really
really love it I think it's so so good
eating it with ketchup and I'm going to
have a water to drink
but yeah I'm enjoying my meal with new
girl on the screen and that is my dinner
that is also the last thing I will be
eating today so ignore the horrible
lighting but I think I am done for the
day so I really hope that you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
watching I'll have jewelry's blog link
