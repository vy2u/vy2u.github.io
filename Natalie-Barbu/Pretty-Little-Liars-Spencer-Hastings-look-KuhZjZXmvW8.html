doing or I'm going to be doing another
Prix de l'Arc inspired tutorial today
I'm doing Spencer Hastings she's more of
the book smart serious a person the most
type of person in that series if that
made any sense at all um and I just feel
like her look is more of a put together
yet not blinging out flashy and I like
colorful or anything like that seem like
a smoky eye or anything just very clean
classy elegant very pretty and also her
lip just I think everything about her is
gorgeous I don't love people say that
like Aria or hand our Emily are their
favorite but personally Spencer is one
of my favorites I'd have to say arias my
favorite actually I'm gonna kind of go
with the crowd but Spencer is definitely
one of my favorites she's probably
sucking in the list and I just think
that she's such a remarkable like
there's something so different about her
look um I'm gonna I think I'm gonna
completely butchered her name is it
troian bellisario I have no idea but I
just feel like her look is very
different like she has a look it's like
wait you're really pretty but what is it
about you you know like it's that type
of look and I really like it and I just
felt like doing a tutorial for it and
also I'm gonna be recording quite a few
videos today more like um summer
favorites the summer besties tackle I'll
be doing but I'm gonna do the summer
besties check right now so you'll
probably you'll see me in the exact same
outfit so don't think I wear the same
thing two days in a row cuz i really did
it I'll just be uploading them different
days because i'm actually going on a
vacation this in two days yeah two days
and I don't really feel like filming
that many videos there and make them a
video there um but again I won't even
have all my makeup I think I'm going to
do a summer favorites video the summer
besties tag and I'm going to do a show
what's in my travel bag thing my choco I
think I'm gonna do that also but yeah
just want to let you know even though
this is Spencer Shay suits are you I'm
telling you everything I'm gonna do pre
soon but yeah that's it let me know what
other things you want me
tag me in any other tags because i will
do it now and um let me know how you
think about the lighting let me know
when you think about the makeup what you
think of my room sorry my first is on
the bed that relate to feats like the
whole purpose of a nice room but um just
let me know what you think and yeah
enjoy the video this is a really simple
video it's so easy to do like and it's
all drugstore products all the drugs are
products except for my lie liner because
I didn't really feel like buying a new
gel liner all of these I bought
yesterday at CVS with my friends oh I
forgot to mention I've again I'm biggest
idiot ever I know it hurts mention this
in yesterday's video by forgot to put
primer on my lid like to show it in the
actual video I don't know why I keep
forgetting that I think as most the time
I'm used to just like putting primer on
both eyes and then doing it so when I
was doing this I or when I was doing
this night know when I was doing this I
it was like I just feel oh it's like
okay okay okay okay and I was like crap
i forgot to do it in front of the video
so that's why but make sure you put
primer on i'm using i normally used
laura mercier and flax and that's our
dog star product either but I don't even
know drug stores have I primers did i
I've always sounded really stupid right
now for asking neck so they probably do
because drug stores up freaking
everything okay well anyways just let me
know what you think of everything and I
hope you enjoyed this tutorial time ok
today we are going to be using the wet
and wild vanity I think it's in the
color vanity 249 it looks like this it's
really pretty and it's super truth i
only got it for about five dollars which
is extremely cheap for anything you can
get at CBS that's where i got mine you
can get at target you can get it rite
aid walgreens whatever you have ok so
let's get started so first we are going
to take this nice shimmery kind of
whitish color right there it's really
pretty we're just going to pack that on
on their mac 239 brush
oh honey excess and just Pat it on now
we're going to take this light brown
color it kind of looks like the soft
brown from a cliff this is a great Duke
because first of all these six colors
are cheaper than one mac eyeshadow and I
still think that Mac is better because
Mac is amazing but I mean this is
perfect i mean it's fine for the look
we're going for so just take your mac
222 brush it looks like this I'm just
swirl it in that soft brown color and
put it in the crease as you can see it's
very very soft it's really pretty though
this could be used also as an everyday
look especially for summer if you don't
want to take your time doing your makeup
or take a lot of time doing makeup
because this probably this I took or
beside took me like five minutes of the
most and with eyeliner with mascara
everything so it's really good then you
are going to take this really pretty
it's just a white it kind of looks like
um relay from Mac but it's just a white
we're going to use that in highlight
we're going to take the 239 again and
just take the opposite side and put the
white all over it tap up any excess and
just put it directly in your highlight
and the only thing i don't like about
these eyeshadows is that they have a lot
of fallout like it's not very clean i
guess you can say but you can fix that
up really quickly so i think it's fine
hey this is the only product that's not
a drugstore product I'm very sorry about
that but I'm just really in love with it
bobbi brown eyeliner gel eyeliner and
caviar ink with a bobby brown ultra fine
liner pen that looks like this and i
know l'oreal and Maybelline sell gel gel
eyeliners and like wet and wild and the
really good ones supposedly but
I just want to get rid of this one first
before I try any other one because I
mean I don't don't want to be spending
too much money you're just going to take
a bit of eyeliner and we're actually
going to start right in the middle
around right there you see how this I it
kind of just started like right here
we're going to build a thicker line from
the middle and just bring it out
and we're just going to bring it out
just a little bit not wings but kind of
just extend it just a little bit like
that this one kind of went away next
we're going to do mascara and we're
going to actually use my favorite
mascara not the Dior one that I we have
been using but voluminous million lashes
by l'oreal favorite yay just going to
take some next moving on to lips and
cheeks we're going to be taking this
l'oreal true match super blendable broad
blush in the color press precious peach
and one dash two because it matches it
to your foundation I don't use laurio
foundation but I saw which foundation
would most likely match me and this was
the blush that it recommended me with it
looks like this it's really really
pretty like just peachy color and I
wanted this for someone I'm going to
take my son yoga shook you can get this
at target it's a blush brush they don't
really have numbers and if they do I
have no idea what it is cuz i got this
like a year ago and as you can see it
has no numbers on the actual brush but
it did probably did if it does have
numbers on the box and I threw that away
like a year ago so I'm sorry but I just
know it's a blush brush you'll be able
to find it and put a smile for the lip
just got this it's Maybelline it's
number 35 and I'm gonna sound ridiculous
saying this because I have no idea how
to say it and this is probably really
sad is it pink peony yo and why is that
peony I sound really stupid but if
anyways it looks like this it's really
pretty and
and so what we're going to do is we're
just going to take this and just lightly
just spread it on your lid see it's just
a very pretty pink color if you can see
and it's gorgeous I
