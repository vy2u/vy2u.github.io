question and answer video for you guys
I'm so excited to film this like I never

your guys's questions and make sure you

you're new to this channel well welcome
i'm so happy clicked on this video um i
hope that you guys like my content and
if you do thumbs video up and make sure
to subscribe because I filming so many
new videos I'm so so so excited so yeah
let's just get started into this Q&amp;amp;A
video the first question is by elings
elings on Jenna and she asked what is
your dream career so for those of you
that don't know I am a college student
and i'm actually studying engineering
which is not probably what is expected
of a beauty guru but i really really
enjoy calculus and math and stuff like
that and i feel like i can do so much
with engineering so that's why i decided
to major in that but honestly my dream
career would probably be like stylist or
a buyer for a department store and i
know i'm totally not in the right field
for that but i figured also let's say
one day I don't want to do that and then
I still want to be able to work behind
the scenes of the fashion industry I
think it'd be so cool to work it like
the technology department of nordstrom
or just any big department store or
store I think that would be so cool
guadalupe in g underscore 15 asked what
were your goals throughout high school
and the one thing that you wanted to
accomplish so my goals throughout high
school were definitely to maintain a
high GPA
my school was extremely competitive um
everyone like everyone had super high
GPAs I had I believe a 4.9 two or
something like that 4.9 something and I
was not talk to ever send my class so it
was very very competitive I love my high
school I have no regrets of high school
like I really enjoyed high school I miss
it still sometimes but yeah that was my
main goal for high school just
maintaining my high GPA and then um what
did I want to accomplish in high school
I think mainly I think this is more
beginning of college my accomplishment
but in high school I still really wanted
to expand my YouTube not necessarily
gain as many subscribers since I can
because it really isn't about that for
me but just kind of expand my potential
like be better at editing and no like
cool like video light or come up with
cool video ideas like provide content
that you guys want to watch and that i
think it was so fun and there's a whole
year in my life where I did not film
youtube videos because I really didn't
want to and I was not up for it I was
not about to film videos if I didn't
want to do it because I know that you
guys will be able to tell and then just
wouldn't be fair to you guys me just
filming because I just feel like or just
like putting crap videos out there for
you guys so I took a year off and that
kind of hurt my YouTube by losing
subscribers not gaining any for a whole
year but really I'm happy that I did
that because if I wasn't up for it I'd
rather provide content I want to fill
them and that you guys will enjoy rather
than just kind of filming it just to do
it and then anything I'm not liking it
so yeah I guess my accomplishment would
be expanding my youtube
brees the dog tray and asked if you had
a book about your entire life from
beginning to end beginning being birth
and editing me dead how much would you
read that's actually a really good
question and I have seen that question
before not directed towards me but I've
seen it before and honestly I think I'm
greed maybe up until I'm like 10 to 15
years old something around there just
kind of relive the memories and like oh
yeah that happened like totally forgot
about that you know and then um cuz I i
did have like a pretty good childhood
like so it'd be nice to kind of go back
on those memories and I totally
understand if some people what I want to
go back on them and then I think I'd
were in the book because when you have
us when I have a spoiler in front of me
I will read it like I literally read a
spoil everything I know everything
that's going to happen in every TV show
before I watch it because I spoil
everything for myself and I really hate
that I do that but it's true and it's
inevitable so I probably burn the book
because I really would not want to know
the ending and with my whole life
knowing that that's the ending and just
not living it like to the fullest I
guess um if you guys know I'm saying so
yeah it probably read the beginning and
then burn it so I'm not tempted to read
it again cucak Miranda asked if you
could wake up tomorrow in the body for
someone else who would you pick in what
would you do um this push it's hard for
me to answer because I honestly have no
idea I think honestly I would probably
pick I have to answer to this question 1
I would want to be my dogs I would love
knowing what they're thinking and just
I'd be like the best pet ever just sleep
and play and eat and just soon would be
nice and then also I probably want to be
like a celebrity for a day maybe not
someone super super famous like Justin
Bieber or something but maybe like a
Lego Nicole Richie or um something like
that like someone who's in the fashion
industry it's still famous but I don't
know I kind of want to know what it's
like to be super high up in the fashion
world but also a celebrity at the same
time I think that
be pretty cool or maybe like a famous
youtuber maybe like like Aspen or like
meganheartsmakeup or even bethany mota
like I would think that'd be super cool
knowing what it's like to kind of start
where I am and then end up there so yeah
those are my three answers yellow clues
asked who was your favorite character in
one tree hill this question is so easy
definitely Brooke Davis if you're
watching season one and you're wondering
why I'm choosing her I understand but
just keep watching she turns into such
like oh my gosh I wish I could have her
sass her attitude her just outlook on
life I guess I guess sometimes it's kind
of sad or outlook on life and her
outlook on love and stuff like that but
she really is like such a like I don't
know I'd really really like her
character I definitely definitely hands
down she's my favorite character won't
really freeze doctrine asked again fake
makeup brand TV shows songs and toughest
thing about college so if I even make a
brand early decay favorite thing or what
is it favorite TV shows parks and rec
and one tree hill and Grey's Anatomy
those are my top three um songs I don't
really have any favorite songs at the
moment I basically just listen to
anything and toughest thing about
college would definitely be the studying
like maintaining your social life and
you're studying Shana Len now do I'm
sorry if I pronounced that wrong which
she did email me and I love you shona so
thanks she asked me who do you consider
as your biggest inspiration so my
biggest inspiration this is going to
sound super cliche and boring and
whatever but definitely my mom she like
I realized you know as you grow older
there's that saying that's like you turn
into your mother it's very true I've
noticed so many things that I do that
I'm like
gosh my mom would so do that her oh my
gosh my mom would say that so I'm
definitely turning into my mom and like
I'll also as a parent role model she's a
very good mom and I know she's watching
this right now so I love you but
definitely like I'm going sometimes I
complain about our being super strict
and not letting me do stuff that I
really want to do like that all my
friends parents are doing but honestly
I'm probably gonna be just like her as a
parent and she's not super strict she
stood lets me do a lot of things but
like sometimes I just pull that card
like oh you're so sure I'd everyone else
is doing it but definitely I'm
definitely gonna be like her when I'm
older too so yeah she inspires me also
to be like her as mom went over what
cynthia salinas asked what type of hair
products do you use and i have been
using peer award i will link them down
below they are seriously awesome like my
hair has never been this soft this shiny
this like and I shed everywhere like
every time step in a room like there's
hair on the floor and it helps me not

does help and it's seriously expired so
Chinese says soft and I love it so much
Jacqueline period underscore asked if
you could spend all day at the celebrity
who would it be what would you do that
celebrity by the way I love me so much I
love you so much and slippery i would
spend time with would probably Lauren
Conrad sheep excuse me she just seems
like such a classy nice lady not even
like ladies I'm so old like just woman
young woman mom I don't know it's just
like 30 or something already um but she
just seems like so nice and so classy
and she started from reality TV and
ended up like super super classy and
like that never happens and I don't know

ideal job she has her own clothing line

Conrad and Darcy cajon
asked what are your favorite stores to
shop at what's your typical Carla outfit
and what classes are you taking the
semester favor source to shop at
nordstrom definitely I love winter they
sent me their products to kind of try
out but seriously I literally only wear
their stuff now because they're so so
cute urban or urban decay urban
outfitters for you people it was
probably got my top four source to shop
at and then why is your typical college
outfit when it's cold outside i really
don't dress cute for college it sucks
because i love dressing cute and
whenever I'd rescue I feel cute or feel
good but it's so cold and we have to
walk to my classes so it's so easy just
to throw my pair leggings in a big
sweatshirt in like a big like thick
jacket while it's like ice on the floor
and like boots and it's so ugly but like
that's all I've been wearing in the
winter time it makes me so upset but
it's so cold like I don't even have a
choice but in the summer girl i will
just so cute i will be wearing shorts
and tank tops and cute things and
accessories and everything like that and
i will feel so good about myself the
class i'm taking the semester re1 15
which is like a computer programming
class calculus to physics physics lab
cycling i have cpe course and philosophy
ellen's Jenna ellingson or elings on
Jenna Ellenson poly islands and islands
on Jenna alex is jenna asked how would
you describe a person style my personal
style is probably very bohemian but also
with trendy i don't even know what that
makes sense but minimal very minimal
like I think minimal is very in right
now like not accessorizing a lot which
you guys know I love because I I just
too lazy to put on jewelry
this Camille asked what tips do you have
um fashion blogging I followed your
fashionable and tumblr and it inspired
me to create my own so I will be very
straight up with you i am not very good
at blogging personally I love Instagram
blogging and I just started that so guys
follow me for have a fashion blog on
Instagram but as of like tumblr and
blogs by wordpress while most of the
things like I'm so bad at that I just I
can't keep up with so many things at
once I'm not very good at that but on
Instagram I got you but anyways be
consistent definitely post content that
people are gonna want to see you that
you will want to see and make sure you
have good quality pictures I know this
is kind of pretentious e because it's
like what if I can't afford a good
camera like it's very hard because I
personally would not want to follow a
blog that has pictures off of an iphone
works great I thought takes awesome
pictures so if you ever had when you're
good but like I've like a crappy camera
it's all blurry and like the editing is
like not good and stuff like that so
definitely post good quality post and
hashtags are good i never use hashtags
but i feel like they would help I just
don't like seeing so many had like I
hate will promote like hashtag girl
hashtags on hashtag front hashtag beach
hashtag mountain hashtag world hashtag
passionate hashtag like so many hashtags
I'm just like girl kill Abby underscore
