filming my back-to-school super super
quick makeup routine I know that no one
really has time to beat their face for
like 32 minutes to an hour before
classes start so I am your just show you
guys a super quick way to do your face
and also a quick way that I do my hair
which involves no heat which really
isn't anything special but I wanted to
share with you guys one of my tips and I
want to know when you guys go back to
school so please comment below the day
that you guys start and any back to
school videos that you want to see
because right now this is going to be a
really quick chitchat video and I love
something to check it ready with me so
I'm excited for this one and I will be
telling you that a couple stories or not
a couple but a story a very interesting
story that has to do with kind of this
video right so I am doing my makeup so
yeah I hope that you guys are ready for
that one way to start is actually
moisturize your face and everything like
that
I like this NYX honey do me up it's a
primer but it's also super super glowy
and dewy and it is a little sticky like
honey but it feels really nice and I
like the way it looks on your skin so I
just apply it like that and it is a
little stringy because it sticky it is I
will just rub that in and this kind of
gives you a glow so if you don't want to
put too much makeup on but still want to
look lit up and just dewy this one is
perfect and it's a primer so it's not
going to be like super oily and have
your makeup light up your face it's
going to make you just look a little
better I really like the way it feels
and I like the way it makes my skin look
all I'm doing is using foundation I'm
not going to use concealer or powder or
anything like that because I really
don't want to and I don't need to so I
am just applying my favorite which is
makeup forever and this one's running
out so I'm about to use a new one so let
me know what your favorite makeup or
favorite foundation is so I can try it
out and just applying it with a Beauty
Blender excited the quickest way to
apply your foundation all over your face
the story I was going to share is that
if you guys don't know I currently live
in Charlotte North Carolina
and they have the PGA golf tournament
here every year and it is at Quail
Hollow which is a neighborhood around me
with a really really nice Golf Course
and this year my dad got tickets to the
preseason um
I guess like right now preseason going
on and he got tickets to that for today
so he invited me to go with him but I
didn't want to because I know the
biggest golf fan and I'm going to be
doing a little pause in each story to
tell you guys what I'm doing with my
makeup but I just applied my foundation
and rubbed it all over this was just to
give it an even skin tone but I don't
really need concealer but if you do I
definitely recommend doing concealer if
it makes you feel more confident but
personally I don't really want to put
any on I'm actually going in with the
bare minerals bare Pro contour kit I
have been loving this kit lately and it
has a shade blend and a pop of color so
this is the darker one this is the one
that you blend with and this is the
highlight right now we are going to be
using these two colors and first going
to be doing this one and then I will be
blending with this one back to my story
so I really didn't want to go too Quail
Hollow because I don't like call but
then my friends were texting me or
actually my sister was texting me and
she was saying that Justin Bieber was
there and I'm in love with Justin Bieber
if you guys don't know as in a lot of
other girls are too but I love Justin
Bieber and I was going to go to his
concert in New York before he cancelled
the tour so that was really a setting
for me and then I'm just blending it
with the blend color and then I found
out that he was at this place called top
golf and so I really regretted not going
with my dad to de cuello holo tournament
literally just because Justin Bieber was
there but then he was at a place called
top golf which is kind of a bowling but
for golf so you just go and you're like
hit golf balls and you get like you're
with a team or you're with like people
and whoever scores the most points or I
don't know I don't know how God works
he's at that place and my sister was
sending me screenshots of her friends
that are literally golfing right next to
him and so I was so sad so I literally
stopped filming this video I was in the
middle of filming this video got ready
and I'm not kidding 0.3 seconds which is
honey
know that this makeup tutorial is super
fast because I used this exact makeup
that I'm showing you right now and I did
this in about three minutes not ready
and then literally in my car calling
every friend I know being like boy
you're helping me to meet him at TopGolf
and no one could and no one think as a
fan as I am like out of my friends so no
one really wanted to like drop what they
were doing to go and meet him with me
but yeah so that's really sad he's about
30 minutes away from my house right now
and yes I am here not meeting him so I
really hope that I get to meet him
sometime maybe like I'll read into him
tonight I'm going out tonight with some
friends so don't say guys like that
little story I hope this makeup tutorial
isn't all over the place but I kind of
like videos like this because you really
get to see you who I really am you know
but I think I can see the bronze looks
so good already I think it just looks
amazing I'm obsessed with this palette I
think it's the perfect bronze color and
the brush that it comes with I have like
an angle of contour brush and it came
with this this one is amazing amazing
amazing it is called the bloomin brush
and I apply to both the colors with it
and I think it just like is the
prettiest bronze I've tried so many
bronzers and this one is my favorite and
now for the highlight which is my
personal favorite part I am going in
with Mac soft and gentle and I am
applying it with this Ecotools fan brush
and I am just lightly rubbing it in here
and then putting it on the high points
of my cheek this makeup look it's so
quick and simple that as you can tell
I'm talking and I'm still doing this
look like so easy to do and I always
like to pop a little bit right above my
eyebrow and then again on the other side
so just do the high points of your cheek
this brush really makes sure to apply
the perfect amount not too much not too
little and I think that this highlight
with the bronzer is gorgeous and then I
apply whatever is left over on my nose
because I love nose highlights and then
on my upper lip and my chin
I don't know you guys can tell but I am
loving this look I think it makes me
look so glowy and if I wasn't talking
and telling you guys the story about
Justin Bieber I would have been done
with this and it would literally one
minute and I just think it looks so good
now that we are done with the face I
like doing my eyebrows first for the
eyebrows I have been using the benefit
brow Wiz or I think it's not Broadway's
that's honest Agia this is the benefit
precisely my brow pencil what I love
about this is that it is more precise
than the brow is I believe and I really
just love the brush and the applicator
the packaging everything but I do think
I like this a little better than honored
staff here and I am running out so that
is not good I am just applying this
really really really gently on my
eyebrows because this one is a little
darker and it is more pigmented than
zebras so I'm just applying this there
and I also don't already have really
really thick like full brows so I never
want to apply too much for school but I
still think that doing your eyebrows is
essential even if you have thick brows
like me
I do it very very gentle and very simple
just kind of like my natural I see this
one hand make up and this one doesn't
and it's not the biggest difference but
I can definitely tell the difference and
I feel more comfortable when it's like
this so now we are doing the same to the
other eyebrow and I also wanted to ask
you guys
when are you got or what videos you want
to see from me like back to school live
because I want to film a lookbook but I
don't know if I should wait until my
classes start and film what I wore the
first week of classes or if you just
want a completely new like just look
book like before I start classes to film
a good back-to-school look look or just
what I actually wear like in real time I
don't know so let me know I also am
going to blog the first week of classes
so be sure to subscribe to my vlog
Channel and then after I do my brows I
always brush it up it just gives it a
nice full look and a more put-together
look if your eyebrows are ever looking
really bad just brush them out and I
promise they will look 20 times better
as for the eyes I'm going to prime it
with the urban decay eyeshadow potion
this is an OG eyeshadow primer I don't
know if you guys have been using this
for a while but that is one that I have
been using since I think I ever first
started with makeup and but definitely
prime your eyes I think that's one stuff
that's kind of you shouldn't skip
because even if you don't have oily
eyelids normally your eyeshadow creases
just by the end of the day so just to
make sure that it doesn't I would
recommend using that I don't like
putting eyeshadow on so I actually am
going to take this blend color which is
the lighter brown and I am going to be
applying that into my crease with a
blending brush I love doing uniforms
look so if I use this on my face I like
using it with my eyes I think it just
makes me look a little like different
but still super put together and it just
gives dimension to your eyes without
actually really doing anything
it and if you want you can add the
darker color and just lightly blend that
in there too if you guys want a darker I
think I'm just going to do a little tiny
bit and I'm going to focus it more on
the outside and now for eyeliner I love
liquid eyeliner this is the one I've
been using and I love the Kat Von D
tattoo liner and I am just going to
apply it on my upper lash line and wing
it out a little bit after I am done with
the eyeliner which as you guys can tell
it literally makes my whole look like I
love love love wearing eyeliner then I'm
going in with my favorite mascara which
is better than sex by benefit and
applying that on my eyelashes and lately
I haven't been curling them because I
lost my eyelash curler and I'm too lazy
to buy a new one but I actually think
that this mascara is so good at curling
your lashes so I feel like I don't even
really need to curl them after I am done
with that that is basically it for my
eye look
oppan got some is here - say for my eye
look but if you guys want anything extra
I like applying lip gloss or lipstick
and I actually forgot to include this so
this is an OG NARS product for me I've
had it for about five years it is the
NARS orgasm blush and this one is the I
don't know what this is called it's like
a I guess it's like the stick version of
the blush this can go on your eyes and
it can go on your lips and your cheeks
so I applied it with the flat top ur
brush and I just kind of like rubbed it
in the brush or in the product file
and just like taps it on my cheek and
put it out like that we blended it out
and I really like just applying it on
the apples of my cheek because it makes
me look like really smiley and bright
and because it is shimmery I don't want
to apply it where I contoured and you
can apply any leftover on your chin nose
anything like that my favorite go-to lip
product for school is the NYX lingerie
this is a one that's supposed to last
you for a long time it's like a liquid
lipstick but it's not too heavy and it's
very neutral so yes we really careful
with it and only apply a little bit rub
your lips together and personally I like
patting it and there you have it now
this is the finished makeup look I am
obsessed with it I think it's so so
pretty and cute and I literally do this
in about five minutes you guys
as for my hair this is my natural hair
but the only trick that I do
once I hop out of the shower I use this
rough me up by matrix which is a sea
salt spray I've been really liking this
one because it doesn't make your hair
hard or crunchy it just makes it wavy so
I've been rubbing that in my hair after
I get out of the shower and just going
like this to it and roughing it up and
it ends up looking like this which is
perfect for me to go to class I don't
need to go to class with super straight
hair or super curly done up hair but if
you still want something and like have a
little bit more volume and all of a more
style I definitely recommend a sea salt
spray you can literally put that on and
walk out the door and your hair will air
dry into a nice sea salted
like hot mess I guess but I love the way
this looks I think it makes my hair look
really really good and that is it for
this makeup look I hope you enjoyed my
most random makeup video and like very
not put together and unorganized but if
you guys like it and like more of these
super casual videos or you guys are like
no Natalie you need to put more like
professionalism into these videos let me
know I love you guys so much so thank
you so much for sticking with me and
listening to this ranch of a video and I
hope
like this makeup if you guys don't then
don't tell me that but over there you
guys like it let me know any other
