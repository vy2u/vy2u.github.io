i am filming my black friday haul and i
know i have a little late to the game
this is actually kind of kind of a
collab kind of not with my best friend
staff on youtube and we do so many like
collapse together that I don't always
think they're necessarily collapse
anymore they're just like hey we're both
kind of filming the same video so go
check each other out if we're like one
support each others are such good
friends and we just like doing a lot of
the same things so yeah go check out her
channel she's awesome she's also coming
to visit me North Carolina so subscribe
to both of us for like blogs and videos
together and stuff like that but without
further ado I just want to get into this
I know I'm really late and I did not buy
a lot of stuff at Black Friday but I did
get a pretty good deal so this is going
to be a pretty short haul but I just
wanted to show you guys because I love
watching black friday hauls and I'll let
you know what deals i scored so the
first or that I went to was Nordstrom
and I got this long cardigan I think
it's kind of like a dust of floor duster
is that what it's called I really know
it goes down to the floor it's super
colorful this is totally not typical
Natalie style normally I like neutral
colors and like blacks and whites and
beige that's like a lot of things I wear
what I'm wearing right now it's kind of
a cool shirt but um yeah so i don't
really like very neutral colored shirts
but I supposed to get this because I
thought it was super cute and honestly
ever like this where is this winter and
just I can wear it in the spring tubes
like a dress or something I just thought
that was really dizzy like 30 bucks I
nordstrom and its really soft too I like
it let me know what you guys think of
this the next I went two days american
eagle and american eagle holds a very
special place in my heart since I used
to work there in high school but the
first thing I got is this tank top and
you might be looking Natalie it's the
winter of are you getting tank top well
it was like twelve dollars and it's a
you and I can wear it if I go out or
layer it or a patient or next summer
guys like don't knock that out either um
but yeah it's this little tank top and I
think it's backwards yes this is the
press so sorry it's already i'm making
her i like Hank my stuff up already but
then I was like oh and you filled this
video so this is what it looks like but
it has kind of like a scoop just neck I
don't know if you can tell it has like
the two things that open my try to get
closer as a camera I'm so bad striving
you see how that looks like a little
scoop neck thing and then the back is
like totally open and it has crochet
detailing and it's not totally open but
it's pretty low back so the Cameron
doesn't really do it justice but I hope
you guys kind of what I mean I really
just liked the crochet detailing on it
though and is the last thing i got at
american oil it is or are these
sweatpants i've been wearing these every
single night lately I don't want to
sleep the next I feel like when I go to
sleep with those I'll just like mess up
in the middle of the night I don't know
how I'm weird like that but I'm wearing
them just lounging around my apartment
and so you I love these or they're not
cute what am I saying they're so
comfortable I'm sorry I my brain is just
kind of fuzzy right now they're just
very very comfortable sweats and they're
jogger and there may be the
softest things ever like the inside of
them are so soft and I just really
wanted a pair of sweatpants to lounge
around it so it was definitely
achievable what I wanted the next time I
to is urban outfitters and I got this
flannel I love flannels but this I've
been eyeing for so long because it's one
of those that have lace detail at the
bottom I think it's so cute is so much
more dressy than a normal
and it's a very different I got size
medium just cuz I like them to keep
oversized but yeah this was like tights
or leggings or whatever and with the
lace detailing and they send boosts
would be so cute so I'm really excited
to style this and it was only like 20
something dollars and it was originally
$80 what you would pay eighty dollars
for that I don't know but I was excited
to get it for a really good to go and
then the last thing I got a urban like I
said I didn't get a lot but it is this
nude for all wet as you see i love
neutral colors but I just really liked
it because I have a black one of these
and eighth floor of one of these and I
wanted more of a softer one so i got
this new one i can wear these every
single day I basically live in these I
love for all s that's the perk of having
small boobs is that you were these all
time yeah i love these urban had a
really crappy sale it was like forty
percent of all sale items which honestly
they have like multiple times jeff a
year so it wasn't really anything
special the next door i got went to is
victoria secret and i actually got two
bras from there so this is nothing
special but i just got this point avenue
to bra because he's always losing bras
guys and then I got a black bra that
same style and I'm currently wearing it
right now so that's fun love that and
then the next door in the last store I
went to is Hollister first thing in got
culture is this maroon burgundy color
flannel I just like large witness
because like I said I like some
oversized I really like this color I
like the way I looked in this color I
know I think with my brown hair and
brown eyes I just like burgundy in
maroon like brings them out I don't
really know but I just really like this
flannel it's super soft and yeah it was
50 who set off so there
you're not going $20 yes we are the next
thing that I got is this jacket and I'm
obsessed with this this is my favorite
thing I not all black friday so it is
this green army green really heavy
jacket because it gets cold in North
Carolina so I really wanted to eat
really good but Jack is the nekkid eyes
that was all so cute and I like it
because it has like the flannel powder
on the inside if you guys can't tell I'm
really digging flannel as I am every
season but yeah I like it just because
it's on the hood and on the inside so
it's not like a flannel jacket because
when I wearing it and I look like this
but it's just such cute detail and it
really adds a lot to the look of the
jacket so I was really excited about
this and I got over 50 bucks which is
very cheap for a really good like a
heavy jacket and I don't know i love
army green army green is like my color
but yeah as I told you this was a super
short black friday haul but I hope you
