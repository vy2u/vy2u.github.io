kind of Ages sitting down talking video
I have not done one of these in forever
just sitting on my bedroom floor yeah
anyways this video I've been watching a
lot of YouTube videos lately shocker I
know and I came across a lot of kind of
what I Hate About You Tube why betta you
suck why beauty theories are all fake
and mean and rose it whatever you name
it and you think you kind of mean about
me gurus there's video on it so if you
guys don't look this up you know you
will definitely find them um but I come
on make video in response to those and I
know ninety-nine percent of people that
make those videos are in fact people
that do like makeup and fashion videos
themselves so it's not really other
people bashing the beauty community it's
the beauty community bashing the beauty
committee which i think is so weird
night I can't say community fast I'm
saying like community I don't even know
but ignore my not being able to speak
properly I just want to make this video
kind of in response to those and
something that I guess you can call this
a rant but it I don't really mean it to
be hateful um but it is just kind of why
like why does this show much hate on
YouTube button specifically the beauty
community because I don't really watch
anything other than that so I can't
really speak for the gaming community
and the sports 1 and the music one
because I don't really watch that so I'm
specifically talking about what I am
currently in right now and what probably
a lot of you guys aren't into that are
watching this video
so I just replaced by some preface this
by saying I'm not consider myself a
legitimate like beauty guru in terms of
if anyone came up to me and asked me hey
like tell me about yourself i'm a beauty
guru like no I don't concern myself that
but someone was like hey are you a
beauty guru on youtube I'd be like uh
yeah because I make fashion and hair and
makeup videos and stuff like that and
other random videos too so yeah consider
myself to have so on Ashley and but not
in the actual definition of a guru
because i do not know a lot about makeup
besides what I learned at home and
through YouTube so yeah so I would not
consider myself a professional or
anything like that I'm not a
professional makeup artist and not a
professional hairstylist regular
clothing stylist filmography edgert
whatever i'm just a 19 year old girl
sitting in my bedroom floor he'll win
the city over you guys cuz you know I
want to and I love it so also I kind of
want to say that i love youtube and i
started this for years for years ago and
Finn I took kind of like an off year and
a half it I started this a long time ago
so I've been in it for a while I'm not
saying on that experience and I'm just
saying that like I know YouTube used to
be like four years ago versus what it is
now and I shall say that I love both of
them I love what eats me and I
absolutely love YouTube now I still love
you tube I love the beauty community and
I love so much about it like of course
there are downsides there are down sense
of everything they were down sides back
then and there's still time sigh so so
many people have been
singing how much they hate it and how
all beauty girls are big and mean and
whatever and I don't know specifics
people that i watch the videos i watched
a bunch of them just because i was
honestly genuinely interested in what
they thought because i will be honest i
do agree with some of them but i would
never make a video on things that i hate
about beauty gurus this is not a video
that about hating beauty gurus at all
those gurus I made it I'm subscribe to
some of them and I really do enjoy their
videos and I really do enjoy them so it
is not anything you get fat at all it's
kind of about the idea of those videos
that they are very painful and negative
and I think they portray YouTube is it
such a negative light and I don't think
it should be because what's like all
that people that make youtube videos
should love making it I absolutely love
making YouTube videos I don't do it for
the subscribers but I do do it for
myself because I actually am happy
filming like when I film I actually like
actually I'm happy of course I do it for
subscribers because i love you guys but
I don't do it to gain subscribers in
terms of the only reason I'm doing it to
become famous like no that's not it I
genuinely love editing and making videos
in whatever and i just downloaded Photo
Club pros am I editing for me a little
bit better guys but the videos were just
saying how specific you youtubers are
always like oh my god so this product is
the best product hope I rub over say how
like that's so annoying and it's so big
and whatever like I just don't get why
we have to be
calling out everything that we like like
this one / I honestly do not remember
names but just saying how like how much
we hate little things that people do how
people have been commenting on physical
appearances and just things like that
that really bothers me because I think
as a beauty community we should be
supporting each other and I know this is
kinda gonna be hypocritical of me
because I'm kind of talking about the
things I don't like about those videos
that talk about think something out like
so I don't want this in the come off as
hypocritical because I generally I was
interested in watching those videos and
I watched them and I did not leave any
mean comments or whatever like I
generally like was interested in
watching that and I was cut like I still
watch them you know so i hope this
doesn't come off as I pimp out of the
black hit the critical video but I just
kind of wanted to talk about all the
hate on YouTube and there are so many
hateful things now and I think that most
of us most of the beauty can we meet our
girls I would assume I think so could
have looked at the demographics and
these same those people that watch my
video are girls let all the guy but were
yours too but most of them are girls and
most of you would comment our girls and
most basically all the people at comment
on my videos that have mean comments are
girls too I don't edit like why do
people feel need to comment and be like
oh my god you're so ugly I couldn't even
finish watching this video like
okay thanks like you don't need to watch
my video you can please click out of it
I'm subscribed block me whatever but
like why are you so compelled put that
in it like why are you so compelled for
me to know that I'm ugly like really are
like a lot of my videos people have
talked about girl like your eyebrows are
so ugly like you really need to fix them
they're so ugly I couldn't even watch
the video because I was distracted by
how ugly they were blah blah blah and
like okay thanks i know i should i just
got them down guys cuz the almost
comments / i mean all set should have
gotten I'm done but like you did it
still not like why are you saying that
like what like II especially girls
because we know how we feel when people
tell us like girls are very two boys
aren't secure do I'm not gonna say boys
don't have issues do but this is
specifically because I don't know
personally the issues that was happy
because I'm not a boy and girls like we
know how it feels when people are mean
to us and when people calls me names and
most of time girls do not have the
greatest self-confidence to say I'm so
beautiful i don't care if someone calls
me ugly that is so rare and I envy the
people that are like that because that
is awesome if you're typing out like you
are so ugly and then keep writing this
stuff and then you hit the send button
like you have a couple seconds to
process what you're writing to hit send
to exit that video and not have a second
about Rumania should have said that like
I know it might be like oh hey I'm just
in front of a screen you don't know me
you've never met me you probably won't
meet me if we don't live in the same
area like that sort of thing but I'm
still person in the flesh Here I am
sitting on my bedroom floor just gotta
drive through starbucks someone saw me
you know like I'm a person so yeah and
what else is a person do wow this is
like the most thing ever or people like
but yes we are so I think before you
leave a mean comment we should think
twice and then hey what if I was getting
this comment on my facebook or my
Instagram whatever you have if you don't
have YouTube because it's not very nice
and I just I don't see why do so many
people think it's cool to hate and I
love you guys so much what please don't
tell you guys I don't appreciate you
guys because I do I've literally made me
talking about three people that leave me
in comments whatever I just seen it on
so many people's it's not even just mine
because I'm unfortunate and I don't
really get that much hate but I still do
Bobby's to get a couple and it comes
with the territory I totally know and I
have developed thicker skin from it but
at the same time you can get a hundred
nice ones and then the mean ones will
get to you and it's just like why I
schoo through people's like what some of
my favorite buger I go through their
comments and there's so many nice up and
then I'll see one that's like super mean
and uncalled for and I'm just like what
like why is that person say now why did
they click send like it's not just like
me talking and something accidentally
blurts out and I'm just like oh man I'm
so sorry that came out so rude I
definitely need to purchase smell like
that I'm sorry whatever it is when
you're talking you know things can kind
of word well MIT and you just say
something you really don't mean or even
if you do mean it I'm not saying you
need to think everyone is beautiful and
I'm not saying you need to like everyone
because you don't dare aplenty have
people on YouTube up just like wow I do
not ever want to watch your videos again
and that's totally fine because it's not
like I'm leaving comments on their
videos wow I don't ever want to watch
your videos again you just suck like no
se
yeah like you can think it obviously
tried not to be so judgmental and mean
and stuff in your head but let's say you
are like a man I really wish she plucked
her eyebrows like you don't need to type
it out I don't understand like it's not
even just like saying it and like oh
thought too fast said it didn't think
before I spoke it's like you're typing
it and you are allowed to process it and
then you still hit Send things on the
internet it's like we really need to be
careful with what we say with what we
type with everything because we actually
have time to think about it and it's not
really an excuse if you're mean on it
because you have time to edit it and
revise it and before you hit Send you
can read it a million bajillion times
and think about if you would want this
to be sent to you and I just that those
beauty videos that were like what I hate
about the beauty community about how
girls are so fake blah blah blah really
start starting on this because even
people in the beauty community are being
mean to us like being mean to themselves
basically like I see girls making makeup
videos in tutorials and then they're
going and making fun and not go making
fun literally saying how much they hate
people who hold stuff up and have a
candle burning in the background and
whatever like it's just like it's just
like that might be just something that
they do like sometimes I will actually I
don't never had a channel Bernie the
background today I should just thought
the candles no be he'll be seeing this
crazy but oh my god my dogs to like even
beauty gurus and the people in the
beauty community are being mean to
others and the beauty community and I
just things to stop because once there's
one mean video there's 10 million once
there's one room touring obscene of all
sorry I just had
like the same thing that people love
recreating videos and that's great and I
probably sound probably made this video
to before not probably reading it
whatever so like I think hate is kind of
like a chain reaction where what one
mean thing happens people think it's
okay because they're like oh I'm not the
first one to say it like on my prom
video okay yes my maybe I should have
pluck my eyebrows a little bit more and
they were too close together whatever
literally every single time I get a new
comment on that video it's telling me
something about that and we're just like
enough already I get it like why you
guys need to keep commenting on that
it's like it's just like does it really
make you feel better saying you look
disgusting and your eyebrows are so ugly
and there is a difference between
constructive criticism and main
criticism and constructive is like hey
you would look so much better if maybe
you had a higher arch and you had them a
little further apart but like whatever
that's okay because you're not saying
something like you suck I hope you die
you know you see the difference or like
if you're saying I was distracted by
this video because you're I residents I
don't even watch it it's like okay we're
so distracted then click the X button it
like it's right there you don't eat a
comment like oh my god that's good what
I wanted to say how I've noticed a
pattern in beauty community waiting on
the beauty community and then people
just thinking that it's repeated comment
so many mean things and I hope that this
video kind of random the word vomit and
I'm going to make a blog version on my
blog so that will maybe be a little bit
more organized because guys like I can
type in it i can edit it i can revise it
i can make sure i said what i want to
say i can bake the right message like
cuz I'm you're typing you have a chance
to correct yourself so that's why
there's not really that big of an excuse
the internet when you're saying mean
things because you can edit it out just
like even with me talking in front of a
camera I edit these videos I can chalk
what I want to take as I'm like us I may
have had an attitude there delete clip
you know so like that's why it's just
like you guys really should know you
guys we all we all should really be
careful what we say on the internet
because we'd all have feelings and even
subscribe or even people with like a
million bajillion subscribers have
feelings too so yes that's just kind of
a thought of me of why people should
stop hating on YouTube oh I hope that
this video is just makes sense i will
definitely linked in my blog down below
and be sure to look out for that blog
post but yeah that's just kind of so
anyways I hopefully you guys enjoyed
this video and I don't want this to seem
like a hate video where I hate my
subscribers because I love my
subscribers so much like when I get
20,000 subscribers I'm going to be doing
a really big giveaway so I'm excited
about that so make sure you're
subscribed and like I can't imagine
having over 100 followers like that just
blows my mind like it's just like that's
so insane I cannot imagine having 19,000
people in my backyard and seeing all
your faces and I would probably cry and
like pass out because that'd be insane
so the you lied so much because I really
do love you guys and the fact that i'm
just a normal girl from it a small town
in North Carolina like not like country
road town because it's not but like it
probably pretty like not to populated
city in North Carolina um that's just
saying to me
I thank you guys so much and I love you
guys and people that post mean comments
and tell like I don't like you guys it's
just I think hey maybe we should watch
what we say think of this I've not seen
one of these videos so maybe she will
just don't know that it's like really
bothers people but yeah so I love you
guys and so by and I will talk to you
guys later again even if just I probably
will get some hateful comments below
this video maybe maybe not but I mean
even if I do I still love you guys and I
still love you tube so much like people
that hate youtube and still like videos
like then just stop making videos if you
hate it so much I love making videos you
guys I enjoy the editing process I enjoy
the filming process I enjoy the coming
