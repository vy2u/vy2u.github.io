after a long day of work so I basically
was just doing group work and project
work so now I'm just back in my room and
this is my favorite time of the day you
guys don't understand how happy I am
when I finally gets to go home and just
lounge and do whatever I want to relax I
think that's my favorite part of the day
so before dinner before it's only about
6 o'clock I think it's a let's see 5
o'clock so it's not dinnertime yet
sometimes I eat dinner this early but
tonight I have dinner plans so I'm
eating later I'm just gonna sit down and
lay in my bed and watch some YouTube
videos catch up on everything but just
like relax get under my covers I'm so
excited
normally I actually don't get under my
covers until I'm like actually going to
bed so I will just use one of my
blankets I'm just cover myself up it's
like so nice thank you yeah I am
lounge it's like they reported today let
me know what your favorite part did you
tell you I'm laying in bed like I said
and I am watching youtube videos and
this is basically the most highlight of
my day I am actually watching Keaton I'm
watching coincidentally her morning
routine I think this is from like two
months ago but I never saw it so I'm
watching it really cute look going on
their iPods the video so you guys could
see but I like watching other people's
morning routine videos or anything like
that before I'm about to film one so
yeah let's see how it is so I am eating
a healthy attempting to be healthy snack
because tonight we are going out to a
Mexican restaurant and I know I'm not
gonna be healthy so you know gotta get
my healthy food somewhere so I just cut
up some food I it's eight it's we're
going to eat at eight and that's
currently seven o'clock right now my
stomach is growling I'm just beyond
Charvet so I feel like I have to eat
before I can't just wait another 45
minutes I cut up some red bell peppers
the Chipotle is not mine by the way this
is my roommates um I got off some triple
red peppers and I have some hummus and I
will be eating that so good and healthy
you guys cuz Mexican food will not be
healthy
hi touchy right now my dinner with my
friends and I don't eat out every single
night but my dinner right now and we're
getting Mexican food and I got a
quesadilla and an enchilada and three
crises oh but my friends like don't like
being in the camera this is like an
industrial engineering squad the viewers
that are engineering back from dinner as
you can see my phone up throughout the
day just gets worse and worse and it's
just a big giant mess so I am about to
go and take off my makeup I change into
my super comfortable PJs I always just
sleep in like a giant t-shirt and
sweatpants that's just my go-to I'm not
wearing any cute pajama sets tonight but
super super comfy and then I am going to
head over to the bathroom to wash my
face this is the worst and best part of
my day and you guys will understand why
I always start out with an oil to take
off my makeup so instead of using makeup
wipes I just rub this all over my face
and it takes it off it's great you guys
will see in my skincare routine which I
will be uploading soon and then I just
washed my face and I apply my cleanser
to one of these little fun brushes it's
from vanity planet it's the spin for
perfect skin and I just do that just to
get really dig down in there and get all
my makeup off that the oil left on my
face since I just rinse it off and then
I rinse off my cleanser I spray some tea
tree oil I apply some moisturizer and
then I brush my teeth now I am all done
with my skincare my face feels so fresh
you guys I love applying moisturizer on
right after I've used that brush because
it seriously
makes me feel amazing I have always been
a fan of like Claire Sonic's and just
any sonic brushes or any like vibrating
brushes and with bristles just because
they really do exfoliate your skin so
that is why I really
think I have not been breaking out is
just like extra skin skin extra skin
carrot steps because in the summer I'm a
lot lazier but I'm also I don't have
stress so like that's why I don't break
out but in the summer I swear at half
the time I like to wash my face at night
like I have a very lazy skincare routine
in the summer so during school I really
have to step it up so what this is my
Fit best
and where's part of the day because I
hate actually having to get up out of
bed or just even when I'm so so tired be
so lazy to actually get up take my
makeup off wash my face all of that
stuff but honestly I feel so good
afterwards so that's why it's like the
best part because I feel great it's the
worst because I'm just so lazy
you girls understand if you guys wear
makeup you totally feel me I know that
you do comment down below if you do
before I go to bed I actually just walk
on over over here and I have these
sleeping gummies which are amazing so
I've been taking these restful sleep
it's just melatonin and it makes you
sleep like a baby yesterday I went to
bed at 9:30 and it was absolutely
glorious so highly recommend these
they're the only ones they're really
good they have a bunch of other vitamins
and you can get them at Target and now
the best part is taking off all my
pillows I was already laying in bed for
a little bit if you guys can't tell and
just crawling into bed it's my favorite
part I'm about to go to sleep and I'm
actually just gonna chill on my computer
chill on my phone that's typically what
I do I like to watch some Netflix you
did like an episode or two or three or
four or five who knows um but I am just
laying down and part of the day and it's
Thursday guys so my weekend is started
so it's even better of a night I'm just
so happy I'm in bed I'm definitely not
one of those thing that I throw out on
Thursday nights that is a very rare
occasion for me this is what I do on
Thursday nights so I'm just excited to
be in bed and laying down and about to
go to sleep and I really hope that you
guys enjoyed this video if you like vlog
style is like more personal and you guys
get to know me more and it's just less
fake I feel like other videos with
tripods and stuff are just a little more
fake for me not necessarily like
youtubers but for me they just feel more
fake because I'm not even filming at
night half the time and like I'm like
making up stuff to put into it I feel
like or I'm like trying to make it artsy
and I don't know I just think that this
is so much more real and you guys
actually see what I do at night
just some like fake video really hope
that you guys enjoy this video and if
you guys want other vlogs not routine
vlogs go to my vlog channel because I
will be doing vlogmas this year and I
will be vlogging a little bit before
then too so be sure to do that but I
really hope that you guys enjoyed this
video I'm about to turn off the lights
and go to sleep and I swear the
melatonin eats me like a wall of bricks
I am out with those gummies but I'll see
you guys in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
