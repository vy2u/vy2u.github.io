I am coming to you guys with a
back-to-school life hacks video this is
mainly geared towards high school and
college students but obviously if you're
in middle school you can definitely
learn from these and stuff but yeah this
is mainly geared for high school college
because I am in college so I don't know
I just like I relate to it more I don't
know about you guys but I am NOT the
biggest fan of the life hacks that are
just honestly stupid I hate saying that
but like some of them it's just like
come on me and you both know literally
no one is going to do this life hack
like no one so i hope that i come to you
guys with a more like realistic one and
maybe one that you guys can actually use
back to school I just remember watching
some and be like who so this is not to
like bash other youtubers that do life
hacks cuz like I said like obviously
these are successful videos and people
like doing them and stuff like that
people love watching them and here i am
doing one but i hope that this serves as
a more one that you guys can use I don't
know and before I get started make sure
that you check out my friends Jess this
is a collab with her she is actually
doing a back to school haul which I know
that my viewers absolutely love halls
because those are like one of my most
popular videos so make sure that you go
and check out step and before we get
started she just wants to like let you
guys miss something so that you guys can
meet her hey guys my name is stephanie
and i just did a whole a whole lot of
clothes a book some room decor stuff
some perfume and lotion and phone cases
and all that good stuff head over to my
channel if you guys want to see that i
love to have you over there okay love
you not if you're new to my channel be
sure to subscribe i'm not trying to make
this intro really long but yeah these
are to subscribe i post videos every
tuesday and friday so high happy friday
hope you get some good weekend now let's
just get started into the back-to-school
hacks so the first life hack is going to
start off in the morning
you guys get up for your day of school
so if you guys actually make a playlist
and maybe have like five songs in there
or like seven songs depending on how
long you want to take to get ready that
matches up around the time that you want
to be ready and if you just hit that
playlist on shuffle or repeat and by the
time the playlist is over that means
that you need to be ready so I know that
was a good idea because I actually do
this in the car rides so i'll be like
okay let's see how long it takes me to
get to like target and i'll play music
and I'll account how many songs that
takes me and then I know okay that's how
many songs too I don't know I measure
out things and songs because I'm always
listening to music so I think that's a
good idea if you guys check out like
Spotify you guys can make your own
playlists and just add like five six
songs that should be about 25 minutes I
don't know if you guys need longer than
that but I normally get ready in like 20
minutes so you guys just need a couple
minutes or however many add songs to
your playlist play that and you'll know
like oh crap I'm on the second to last
song I need to hurry up I just thought
that was really fun and like creative
and I've never heard anyone say that
before the second one I thought was
actually so funny so I decided to
include it I don't know about you guys
but whenever I have gum in class there
will probably be like two or three
people that are like Halley's can I have
a piece of gum and of course you're not
gonna say no like you're gonna give it
to them unless you want to be known as a
mean person so you give it to them and I
am so guilty of asking people for gum
because honestly I barely ever bring
them to school and like whenever someone
else has gone I always ask if I can have
peace I'm like so guilty of that someone
should use this life hack on me you
actually carry around an empty gum pass
with you guys so like if you're like
pulling it out of your backpack who like
trying to be secretive instead of being
like like no I don't have any more and
then they look over and then you have
more and you just look like not nice you
can actually just carry on an empty gun
pack with you which literally takes no
space in your backpack and just pull it
up like sorry does my last piece it's so
funny I thought that was hilarious when
I read that I saw it on pinterest and
I'm like honestly would not be surprised
and people started doing that's me third
life hack I thought was the most genius
thing and I'm not gonna lie i have done
this myself I'll tell you guys at the
end we're parking passes especially if
you guys go are in college you guys know
parking tickets are so prevalent and
like
it's just so annoying there's so many
restrictions on parking at school like
you cannot park anywhere at a college
campus you literally cannot park
anywhere I know basically Edward in
college can relate to me as socially if
you have a car or you've been to a
college campus so something that I
thought was really funny is to put an
old parking ticket because we all know
that we've gotten one of those take an
old parking ticket and just put it in
your windshield wiper when you park so
that it looks to like when people come
by to check to make sure if you got a
ticket or not like if they're about to
give you ticket I'll be like oh she
already has one she just hasn't come to
check it yet that is genius like don't
blame me if your car still gets towed or
if you still got a ticket but funny
story so about freshman year I would
visit UNC Chapel Hill a lot um I still
visit that a lot but like yeah I would
visit it a lot freshman here and the
parking where I would always park where
like my friends storm was it was so
strict on parking so one day he had
gotten me a parking pass and it was like
10 bucks wasn't a lot and I put that
parking pass on for that day and I left
it on every time I went there like every
time I just put that mark in math even
though it said like oh from october and
i was using it in the next April like i
would just use at all time in my car and
never got towed so secret what one of
those on your car because they won't
they're not gonna like inspect it so
they're not going to tell you I mean if
they do don't blame me the fourth hack
has to do with exercise and exercise is
such a big part of college students
lives because the freshman 15 is very
real and you don't want to gain the
freshman 15 just because you're eating
pizza and chips and like soda and all
that stuff so that is why exercise is so
important so these are two of the
exercise habits that I have so the first
one is to get my water app I have it on
my phone and it just tells you you can
put them out your water bottle isn't
like the size of your water bottle and
it gives you reminders throughout the
day like how much you should be drinking
so you know how much water to drink I
think that is so genius because instead
of trying to figure it out yourself you
actually have an app that tells you and
also this is a bad school hack but
everyone checks their phone during class
so like it's a cute little things like
Oh check my phone to hack water like in
school any notification on your phone is
like an exciting one because you're so
bored in class don't worry i feel you
guys so that is why my water app is
great
tells you and like it doesn't need to be
loud or anything you can just like see
magnification see how much water you
should be drinking and drink it and it's
like depends on your water bottle size
so it's awesome this is not sponsored by
them at all like i just found this app
and i like it so that's one like being
healthy hack the next one is not really
a hack but it's something that I've been
doing so makes put exercise a part of
your schedule if you are like me to do
lists and like schedules are your life
so for me exercises such a big part of
my schedule like I have to do it's
basically like going to class like I
make going to the gym like going to
class so every single day or every other
day I have a gap into my classes and I
go to the gym been the other days I get
off in the morning so I go right after
that so I wear my workout clothes to
class and then I go to the gym right
after class put it a part of your
schedule and you will do it and then it
just becomes so much of a routine you
don't even think like oh I don't want to
go it's just like I don't want to go to
class but like oh well I have to so
please put it in your schedule I promise
you'll thank me later the food pack is a
kind of studying better organizational
hack so in your notebook leave about a
page in the front so don't use the first
page at your notebook and make that a
table of contents I used to do this a
lot in high school I don't really do it
anymore in college but I used to do it
in high school and I had to put like the
table contents so like every single new
note I would or every single new page or
like new topic of notes I would write
like the page number and the topic in my
table of contents and it really helped
me during finals because when you're
going through finals or when you like to
reviewing over things and you don't know
where this was in your notes you can
just look at that and find it right away
number six is actually a couple of them
kind of it's just like overall studying
it so for studying I have three tips for
you guys or hacks for you guys is this
just one I do all the time I swear it
helps if you pretend to teach yourself
or pretend that you're teaching a class
in order to study so if you think that
you're going to actually have to teach
someone or better yet actually try to
teach someone but if you think that
you're gonna have to teach someone you
will learn the material so much better
because you're gonna put it in ways
that's easy to understand this helps so
much I'm not kidding you guys whenever I
am studying I would go over it in my
head like I'm teaching another student
or I will actually ask like my friend
that's in my class or some of that I'm
sitting with being like okay like can I
just pause for it let's pause for a
second can I go over this with you and I
will teach it
it helps so much it just makes you your
brain think like okay I got to get this
down because I'm about to teach it to
someone and then it also puts it in
simple terms so that you and the other
person can understand so it helps so so
so much the next one is to rewrite your
notes this one I know you probably hear
a lot of times but actually if you
rewrite your notes that's the same as
going over it seven times which is crazy
and I'm gonna give you guys some little
notes inspo so here are some pictures of
pretty notes so that you guys can get
inspired and make sure don't look like
that so when you're writing that I what
I do in class is I write them really
really sloppy I just rewrite it like I
write it like who cares it doesn't
matter and then after that i will
rewrite it and i'll make it really
pretty like practice my handwriting i
will like organize it better because
when you're taking those you don't
really know how you want to organize it
because you don't know what's coming
next so that when you're rewriting them
you can organize it better which might
help you if you have photographic memory
and it also will just like make you
study like make you remember it so that
is what I do behind this is coming from
an engineering student so I have had
plenty to study for and I'm telling you
guys these are actually things that I do
and then the next one I thought was
really cool this one's more for like
people that need to memorize facts or
definitions or something like that don't
really mad face but if you write in a
weird font so just type it out on your
computer in a really weird font studies
show that you will actually remember it
more it's kind of like when you think of
something like whenever I was doing
vocabulary or learning definitions or
memorizing terms I would always
correlate it and relate it with the
dumbest thing because that is what I
would remember I'd be like wait oh that
uh photosynthesis reminds me of the word
photo which whenever I go outside I take
photos of flowers you know things like
that things that absolutely don't make
sense because then they will make sense
to you in the end it is mainly for
memorization but if you do it in a weird
font same purpose goes for that you will
remember it Morris and then the last one
I thought was super cool I actually have
this plug-in on my computer so if you go
to Chrome extension so if you guys you
google chrome if you don't highly
recommend it just type in TL semicolon
dr chrome extension and it'll come up
it's basically something that will scan
articles and just summarize it for you
and you can email it to yourself or you
can just read it right there
actually tried this with a few news
articles and it really works so it's
basically called too long didn't read so
if an articles too long for you and
don't feel like reading it which come on
who hasn't done that um you just get
that chrome extension and able summarize
the article for you with all the things
that you need to know about it and
that's it I was it for this life hacks
