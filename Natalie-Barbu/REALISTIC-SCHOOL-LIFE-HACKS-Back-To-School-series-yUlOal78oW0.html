I am coming to you guys with a
back-to-school life hacks video this is
mainly geared towards high school and
college students but obviously if you're
in middle school you can definitely
learn from these and stuff but yeah this
is mainly geared for high school in
college because I am in college so I
don't know I just like I relate to it
more I don't know about you guys but I
am NOT the biggest fan of the life hacks
that are just honestly stupid I hate
saying that but like some of them it's
just like come on me and you both know
literally no one is going to do this
life hack like no one so I hope that I
come to you guys with a more like
realistic one and maybe one that you
guys can actually use back to school I
just remember watching some and being
like whoo so this is not to like bash
other youtubers that do life hacks cuz
like I said like obviously these are
successful videos and people like doing
them and stuff like that people love
watching them and Here I am doing one
but I hope that this serves as a more
one that you guys can use I don't know
and before I get started make sure that
you check out my friend Steph this is a
collab with her she is actually doing a
back to school haul which I know that my
viewers absolutely love hauls because
those are like one of my most popular
videos so make sure that you go and
check out step and before we get started
she just wants to like let you guys miss
something so that you guys can meet her
hey guys my name is Stephanie and I just
did a haul a whole load of clothes a
book some room decor stuff some perfume
and lotion and foam cases and all that
good stuff
head over to my channel if you guys want
to see that I would love to have you
over there okay
loving that if you're new to my channel
be sure to subscribe I'm not trying to
make this intro really long but yeah
these are to subscribe I post videos
every Tuesday and Friday so hi happy
Friday hope you guys have a good weekend
now let's just get started into the
back-to-school hacks so the first life
hack is going to start off in the
morning when you guys get up for your
day of school so if you guys actually
make a playlist and maybe
have like five songs in there or like
seven songs depending on how long you
want to take to get ready that matches
up around the time that you want to be
ready and if you just hit that playlist
on shuffle or repeat and by the time the
playlist is over that means that you
need to be ready so I know that was a
good idea because I actually do this in
the car eyes so I'll be like okay let's
see how long it takes me to get to like
target and I'll playing music and I'll
count how many songs that takes me and
then I know okay that's how many songs I
don't know I measure out things and
songs because I'm always listening to
music so I think that's a good idea if
you guys check out like Spotify you guys
can make it your own playlist and just
add like five six songs that should be
about 25 minutes I don't know if you
guys need longer than that but I
normally get ready in like 20 minutes so
you guys just need a couple minutes or
however many add songs to your playlist
play that and then you'll know like oh
crap I'm on the second-to-last song I
need to hurry up I just thought that was
really fun and like creative and I've
never heard anyone say that before the
second one I thought was actually so
funny so I decided to include it I don't
know about you guys but whenever I have
gum in class there will probably be like
two or three people that are like hey
Lee can I have a piece of gum and of
course you're not gonna say no like
you're gonna give it to them unless you
want to be known as a mean person so you
give it to them and I am so guilty of
asking people for gum cuz honestly I
barely ever bring gum to school and like
whenever someone else has gone I always
ask if I can have a piece I'm like so
guilty of that so I should use this life
hack on me you actually carry around an
empty gum pass with you guys so like if
you're like pulling it out of your
backpack who like trying to be secretive
and set up being like like no I don't
have any more and then they look over
and then you have more and you just look
like not nice you can actually just
carry on an empty gun pack with you
which literally takes no space in your
backpack and just pull it up and like
sorry jeez it's so funny I thought that
was hilarious when I read that I saw it
on Pinterest and I'm like honestly would
not be surprised and people started
doing that to me third life hack I
thought was the most genius thing and
I'm not gonna lie I have done this
myself I'll tell you guys at the end
we're parking passes especially if you
guys go are in college you guys no
parking tickets are so prevalent and
like it's just so annoying there's so
many restrictions on parking at school
like you cannot park anywhere at a
college campus
you literally cannot park anywhere I
know basically everyone in college can
relate to me especially if you have a
car or you've been to a college campus
so something that I thought was really
funny is to put an old parking ticket
because we all know that we've gotten
one of those take an old parking ticket
and just put it in your windshield wiper
when you park so that it looks so like
when people come by to check to make
sure if you got a ticket or not like if
they're about to give you a ticket I'll
be like oh she already has one she just
hasn't come to check it yet
that is genius like don't blame me if
your car still gets towed or if you
still got a ticket but funny story
so about freshman year I would visit UNC
Chapel Hill a lot um I still visit that
a lot but like yeah I would visit it a
lot freshman year and the parking where
I would always Park where like my friend
storm was it was so strict on parking so
one day he had gotten me a parking pass
and it was like 10 bucks wasn't a lot
and I put that parking pass on for that
day and I left it on every time I went
there like every time I just put that
mark in math even though it said like Oh
from October and I was using it in the
next April like I would just use that
all the time in my car and never got
towed so secret put one of those on your
car because they won't they're not gonna
like inspect it so they're not gonna
tell you I mean if they do don't blame
me the fourth hack has to do with
exercise and exercise is such a big part
of college students lives because the
freshman 15 is very real and you don't
want to gain the freshman 15 just
because if you're eating pizza and chips
and like soda and all that stuff so that
is why exercise is so important so these
are two of the exercise habits that I
have so the first one is to get my water
app I have it on my phone and it just
tells you you can put the amount your
water bottle isn't like the size of your
water bottle and it gives you reminders
throughout the day like how much you
should be drinking so you know how much
water to drink I think that is so genius
because instead of trying to figure it
out yourself you actually have an app
that tells you and also this is a bad
school hack but everyone checks their
phone during class so like it's a cute
bill of length like Oh check my phone to
have water like in school any
notification on your phone is like an
exciting one because you're so bored in
class don't worry I feel you guys so
that is why my water app is great
because it tells you and like
doesn't need to be loud or anything you
can just like see that notification see
how much water you should be drinking
and drink it and it's like depends on
your water bottle size so it's awesome
this is not sponsored by them at all
like I just found this app and I like it
so that's one like being healthy hack
the next one is not really a hack but
it's something that I've been doing so
makes put exercise a part of your
schedule if you are like me to do lists
and like schedules are your life so for
me
exercise is such a big part of my
schedule like I have to do it it's
basically like going to class like I
make going to the gym like going to
class so every single day or every other
day I have a gap in some videos to my
classes and they go to the gym then the
other day I get off in the morning so I
go right after that so I wear my workout
clothes to class and then I go to the
gym right after class put it part of
your schedule and you will do it and
then it just becomes so much over
routine you don't even think like oh I
don't want to go it's just like I don't
want to go to class but like oh well I
have to so please put it in your
schedule I promise you'll thank me later
the food pack is a kind of studying
better organizational hack so in your
notebook leave about a page in the front
so don't use the first page at your
notebook and make that a table of
contents I used to do this a lot in high
school I don't really do it anymore in
college but I used to do it in high
school and I had to put like the table
contents so like every single new note I
would or every single new page or like
new topic of notes I would write like
the page number and the topic in my
table of contents and it really helped
me during finals because when you're
going through finals or when you're like
reviewing over things and you don't know
where this was in your notes you can
just look at that and find it right away
number six is actually a couple of them
kind of it's just like overall studying
it so for studying I have three tips for
you guys or hacks for you guys is this
just one I do all the time I swear it
helps is to pretend to teach yourself or
pretend that you're teaching a class in
order to study so if you think that
you're going to actually have to teach
someone or better yet actually try to
teach someone but if you think that
you're gonna have to teach someone you
will learn the materials so much better
because you're gonna put it in ways
that's easy to understand this helps so
much I'm not kidding you guys whenever I
am studying I would go over it in my
head like I'm teaching another student
or I will actually ask like my friend
that's in my class or someone that I'm
sitting with being like okay like can I
just pause for it let's pause for a
second can I go over this with you and I
will teach it to them
it helps so much it just makes you your
brain think like okay I gotta get this
down because I'm about to teach it to
someone and then it also puts it in
simple terms so that you and the other
person can understand so it helps so so
so much the next one is to rewrite your
notes this one I know you probably hear
a lot of times but actually if you
rewrite your notes that's the same as
going over it seven times which is crazy
and I'm gonna give you guys some little
notes inspo so here are some pictures of
pretty notes so that you guys can get
inspired and make sure don't look like
that so when you're writing that I what
I do in class is I write them really
really sloppy I just rewrite it like I
write it like who cares it doesn't
matter and then after that I will
rewrite it and I'll make it really
pretty like practice my handwriting I
will like organize it better because
when you're taking notes you don't
really know how you want to organize it
because you don't know what's coming
next
so that when you're rewriting them you
can organize it better which might help
you if you have photographic memory and
it also will just like make you study
like make you remember it so that is
what I do because this is coming from an
engineering student so I have had plenty
to study for and I'm telling you guys
these are actually things that I do and
then the next one I thought was really
cool this one's more for like people
that need to memorize facts or
definitions or something like that don't
really matter but if you write in a
weird font so just type it out on your
computer in a really weird font studies
show that you will actually remember it
more it's kind of like when you think of
something like whenever I was doing
vocabulary or learning definitions or
memorizing terms I would always
correlate it and relate it with the
dumbest thing because that is what I
would remember I'd be like wait oh that
uh photosynthesis reminds me of the word
photo which whenever I go outside I take
photos of flowers you know things like
that things that absolutely don't make
sense because then they will make sense
to you in the end
it is mainly for memorization but if you
do it in a weird font same purpose goes
for that you will remember it more and
then the last one I thought was super
cool I actually have this plug-in on my
computer so if you go to Chrome
extension so if you guys use Google
Chrome if you don't highly recommend it
just type in TL semicolon dr Chrome
extension and it'll come up it's
basically something that will scan
articles and just summarize it for you
and you can email it to yourself or you
can just read it right there so I
actually tried this with a few news
articles
and it really works so it's basically
called too long didn't read so if an
article is too long for you and you
don't feel like reading it which come on
who hasn't done that um you just get
that Chrome extension and able summarize
the article for you with all the things
that you need to know about it and
that's it I was it for this life hacks
