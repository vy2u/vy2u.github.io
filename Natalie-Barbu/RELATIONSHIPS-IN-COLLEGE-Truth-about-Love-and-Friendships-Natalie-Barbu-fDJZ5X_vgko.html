lighting is already getting weird hey
guys so it's not only here and I just
got done filming my back to school kind
of what I eat in a day video but for
some reason I just felt really weird
like when I was filming it I just felt
fake or not fake but like I didn't know
what to say I didn't know how I was
going to edit I don't know I felt like
forced to film it and I don't ever want
to feel forced to film any videos
because then it kind of ruins it for me
you guys would have so been able to tell
at that video I don't know I just kept
missing out because we sang the same do
line and like I don't know so it was
just a weird video so instead I change
other like my cute top that I was
wearing the put on this t-shirt that I
got from Goodwill the pelicans love it I
think it's like a baseball you might
literally have no idea and I went to
explains the lighting it's going to be
going in and out because it's just a
natural light because I haven't gotten
my life set up yet but I just want to
film a video on relationships at high
school and or in high school no I mean
this clear apply to high school but I'm
telling a video on relationships in
college and it is not only going to be
romantic relationships it's just gonna
be relationships with like friends
family boyfriend girlfriend whatever
like so it's kind all of the
relationships that you have and how
important they are and how crucial they
are and so I know I just felt this is
more of the video I wanted to film today
and you did there no hair hi I'm Natalie
this videos are normally not this like
casual sit-down chill normally they're
like better than this you can watch my
other ones and then subscribe so I want
to talk to you guys about healthy
relationships because I was seeing a lot
a lot a lot a lot these past few years
in college and just in general a lot of
unhealthy relationships and I wanted to
talk to you guys about healthy ones and
why they are important so this is going
to be grab a drink grab some popcorn got
some snacks because we're just going to
be chatting like forever cut it off
about boyfriend/girlfriend like romantic
relationships because I feel like most
of you guys I clicked on this video
probably want to see that when you read
the title but for me I'm going to show
you guys my experiences with it and then
I'm going to tell you guys think that
I've learned along the way through them
I have it into relationships ever in my
life
and the first one was in high school and
it kind of carried on into college for
freshman year and then the second one
was from sophomore year to now I'm
currently dating the first on network a
high school relationship it was not that
serious it didn't end like super poorly
but it wasn't the greatest end and it
was just like the best word I can think
of it was just like a high school
relationship like it wasn't anything I
don't know like not anything that
serious I get it like when you're in
high school you just kind of date
whoever is at your school or you just
date to date and not that I just stated
to date but like obviously in high
school I don't really think a lot of
people are thinking of marriage and like
having babies and stuff like that so it
was a more casual relationship and then
my second one now is a lot more serious
and it is super healthy and just like I
want to tell you guys things that I've
learned throughout life is my best
experience I dawn that was experienced
but you know the number one thing that I
have to say about them is that they
shouldn't be that hard when we're this
young when we're in just the dating
stages I don't think you should it
relevant relationship should it be that
difficult I think once you get married
and stuff like that like then marriage
is a lot harder than dating but if
you're already having struggles and like
real big issues and spice when you're
just dating I feel like that's kind of a
red flag and also I have a whole video
on cheating but one thing to me is that
like if you're cheating on your
boyfriend a girlfriend like I really
don't think it's meant to be I think
that you guys should just end it there
before you just end up hurting each
other even more I think cheating is one
of like the worst things you can ever do
to someone also when you're in a
relationship and I have a video on that
so she doesn't see it I'll have that
linked down below tips in college need
to be supportive and the person needs to
support you like with my youtube channel
for example that is something that's
like my job like YouTube is my job
YouTube I was into myself a youtuber
YouTube is a huge huge huge part of
like so if I was dating some of this and
support that I really don't think that I
could be in that relationship because if
someone doesn't support what you do or
what you love I just want I don't know
why they wouldn't but also I think that
just also shows that you're so
incompatible so if you right now are in
a relationship and I am NOT here to be
like break up with your boyfriend break
up with your girlfriend I'm just here to
like give you my advice if you right now
are in relationship and they are not
supporting your dreams I guess or
supporting your interests or they like
they kind of make fun of what you love
doing like my boyfriend right now was
making fun of my youtube channel I would
be so so hurt and I had I read this
quote one time and it was don't ever
make fun of someone's passion or and
don't ever put someone's passion down
because that might just be what they're
living for I don't know something like
that but it really really I was kind of
like wow like yeah why would people
because I've been made fun of quite a
bit because of YouTube and so like I
just don't get why people make fun of
people for this because that one thing
that they loved you me might just be was
keeping them alive or might just be was
keeping them going or having them see
the light at the end of the tunnel or
having them want to graduate college so
that's one thing that I learned alive
that you need someone that supports that
because it's so hard to be with someone
and have them tear you down tear a huge
chunk of you so another thing is honesty
it going to go so cheating and hate hate
cheating I think the worst thing ever
but just being honest with each other
and open communication and I just
healthy relationships should be easy
that's like the number one thing that I
think not that saying that boys and
girls don't fight because me and my
current boyfriend right now we
definitely fight we definitely have gone
through arguments there's big times when
I'm like really mad or he's really mad
you know and that's me normal but I
think that if it's to the point where
you're constantly fighting and tearing
each other down and kind of jabbing at
each other or just playing mind games
with each other or I don't know like
being I don't know should be with them
should I not be with them should I be
with them try not being with them and
like always doing that like going
through that routinely I feel like
that's just something that you guys
should think about that isn't that
healthy I guess
because in the dating stages this is
when it's easy and me and my friend
we're actually talking about this quote
and it was don't chase someone that
doesn't want to chase you or or if
you're chasing someone it's too late or
something like that like you should
never have to chase someone and another
quote was you can't fight for someone to
fall in love with you
so you sorry the lighting is so bright
so basically like if you're trying like
you shouldn't try to make someone fall
in love with you they should just watch
it shouldn't be something too that it's
one-sided like if you're chasing them
then it's already too late like you
shouldn't be chasing them this is yours
literally so kinda I don't know I just
wanted to talk about that because I've
seen it so often in girls and guys and
like how many unhealthy relationships
there are in college like it's
ridiculous it's I mean I personally
think that I was in an unhealthy
relationship in the beginning like my
first relationship I don't think was a
very good one once it kind of got into
college I think that that like once we
started being trying to be more serious
and I should have realized like okay
it's not working but I feel like a lot
of girls and guys just have that one
lesson that they need to learn and so I
don't regret anything at all and I don't
look so happy with how everything turned
out but like I do think that a
relationships like you might make a
mistake but like you'll learn from it
and the fact I want to do a
relationships Q&amp;amp;A video so if you guys
want me to do one where I'm actually
answering specific questions please let
me know and then I'll post an Instagram
and have you guys ask me them also when
you're dating someone I feel like the
main thing should that be that you're
comfortable with them they should be
able to make you happy you guys should
agree on a lot of things like how to be
compatible have similar ideas about life
and talk about the deeper subjects talk
about religion talk about children in
the future talk about I don't know like
hobbies that you guys like where you
guys want to raise a family where you
guys on the RHIB and obviously this is
not if you're in high school I really
don't think you guys should be tell us
about this but I mean if you're like
starting to get serious with someone I
do you think that those are important
topics to bring up and then it might
suck if they're not on the same page but
I do think it's important to know before
you guys go further and further
keep into this because one thing I've
also learned is that you cannot change
anyone and no girls especially love
changing guys I think I'll change him
like he might be like a bad kid or a bad
guy or a player but like I'll change him
because I'll make him fall in love with
me and then I'll be the one that changes
him a lot of girls have that mentality
and it's really really unhealthy because
you think that someone needs to be fixed
like people are not your toys you don't
need to fix them so if you can't accept
someone just something they can't accept
you for who you are you should not try
to change anyone even if you think that
they can for you even if they say that
they will for you if a person is
changing for you eventually that will
fade and that will wear off so I really
think that once you get into a
relationship you should make sure that
you let accept them for who they are and
love them for who they are and not their
not a project for you because that can
also be really hurtful for thatis they
realize like oh my god sure just trying
to change me like first like French and
stuff like that so in college I have had
a lot of like I've made a lot of new
friends and I've met new people and I
both a lot of friend drama and the
number one thing I have to say look
right now like the girls and living with
right now are so so sweet and they're so
amazing so I'm like in a really great
place and I loved the girls I was living
like also this other paths through here
in college I feel like a lot of people
are just mean and I've said this before
in many videos but I feel like it's like
you know each other for a month and then
you guys are best friend so it's like
kind of like oh who like uphill really
fast it can also crash really fast
because you don't really know the person
that well so if they do something that
bothers you and might like you might
just drop off and let me like oh my gosh
I hate you how could you do that or like
why are you like that or little things
will smite start anointing you and I
just felt with College it's really
important to be careful of your friends
with and also finally be careful but
make sure that you're not just friends
with them just because that you actually
enjoy hanging out with them or spending
time with them like you should make it
effort to hang out with your friends you
shouldn't lie to your friend you should
talk bad about your friend's girl and
the killer like hanging out with them in
their best friend's whatever and then
like all in a group with just one of
them and all they're doing is talking
bad about the other girl and like their
best friend I feel like that happens a
lot in college just because it is such a
fast like meet and greet and you're
trying to be friends with so many people
in such a small period of time so it's
hard to time
genuine authentic friends I don't know I
just feel like this friendship it's also
a two-way street you have to be asking
them out they have to ask you hang out
you should not be talking behind each
other's backs with my biggest little a
really big is that because when I see
people talking behind each other side I
tried to steer away from gossip as much
as possible and I'm not gonna lie I'd be
like oh my god I never got it because I
do sometimes but I try to catch myself
whenever I'm gossiping and being like
wait why am I doing this and I'm being
honest with you guys many of you have a
chronic helmet and you're like you're
such a mean person why do you got it I
don't intentionally cross it but I'm not
gonna live be like I've never done it
I'm an angel
you know but it's just don't gossip
about your friends don't cuff about
anyone but especially your friends I
would feel so bad if I was a talking bag
behind my friends back then hanging out
with her the next day like I don't know
how people I want to talk to you guys
about this money because it probably not
ELISA so random just because I've been
feeling kind of weird lately I don't
know I'm just been feeling mixed feeling
like I'm really really lucky to have the
people in my life and my family and all
these people in like I didn't used to be
this way I used to feel really low and
like really down about myself so I kind
of wanted to bring this up because I
want to let you guys know the things
I've learned and how now I'm like
feeling so much better and just really
happy with my life right now like my
roommate situation is great me and my
boyfriend are in a very healthy
relationship um I don't really have any
grudges against anyone like I don't I
don't like hate anyone I don't have to
have any enemies or anything like that
so I just wanted to share with you guys
some life lessons and a lot of my
friends have also likely going through
like things with boys and stuff like
that and so what like advice has been
given and I've hear it heard a lot of
stories so I just wanted to sit down and
have this super chill like sleepover
with shoot life I don't think I'd like
this video I also got a nose ring and
it's a hoop if you had liked it let me
know if you guys like the stud better
let me know and wearing falsies because
I was planning on getting my eyelash
eyelash extensions but I was so freaked
out they would ruin my lashes so I
didn't do it um and I just moved into my
new apartment so I think the point I
have to say I like this video
what I eat in a day let me know here I'm
going to do a more specific you a thank
you guys for being like hearing me out
and this video probably distance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
