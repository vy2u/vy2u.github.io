welcome back to my channel and a Happy
New Year you guys I feel like I haven't
talked to you guys and forever I've
definitely been off my game in the new
year and I've had like a lot of anxiety
on that like why haven't I talked to my
subscribers in a while and thank God for
accessible media because I had
definitely been able to keep updated
with you guys and talk to you guys on
there but like I miss you too but if
there's a new to my channel and have no
idea who I am and you're like I just
miss you at all I don't even know who
you are

been off my games alike the game is back
on the ball is rolling so yeah be sure
to subscribe if you haven't already and
Happy New Year you guys we're gonna
clean up my life get more organized stay
focused
focus on things that I love like YouTube
that's basically the general theme that
I am taking into the new year so this
video is actually one that I've never
even seen before and I've never done
before it is a reverse haul so I am
selling a bunch of clothes so I just
wanted to address that because the first
thing I want to do this new year is just
sell things that I do not need in my
life anymore and it's really really hard
for me to give up a lot of these items
because I love them so much and I just
have the memories of them and like I
don't know it's just hard getting rid of
things something I know I might want to
wear this one time like it's really cute
but I'm just thinking I do not mean it I
want to add my life and I'm kind of
using that in everything in my life yeah
this is the perfect time since on this
video I'm gonna get started with these
things
I am sewing and before I get started I
want to say that I am selling all of
this on Poshmark I have talked about
pockmark before and I've used it before
so a lot of you guys I already follow me
on there I've had it for a couple years
now and I've sold a bunch of things on
there but yeah I'm restarting it because
I'm just art of a ton of things so make
sure to follow me on Poshmark you guys
and I actually have a referral code for
five dollars off of your purchase so if
you guys use my code that would mean the
world to me
mr. Bursch Hall it's only super fun and
I'm actually kind of excited to show you
guys all of my old clothes and see your
page
on them I really love them I'm only
selling cute things the stuff that I
didn't like that I knew no one would buy
I just gave away but yeah the stuff is
actually cute that I think that you guys
would like because I feel like I know
you guys so you gonna start off with the
witch who thinks I'm selling or at least
like the sweaters that I'm selling I'm
really good to show you guys these
because they hopefully hoods like them I
want to give these to you and also side
note for all of you guys that buy these
you guys will get a handwritten note by
me I know that's not super cool and not
like a cool person or whatever but I
just want to give like a nice thank you
for buying me clothes first thing I
moving away is the sweater it's in great
condition I've only worn it a couple
times it's like mint green and it's
pretty long but it's not long enough to
be a dress but yeah I think this
definitely keeps you warm and this is
from a Nordstrom the next thing that I'm
giving away is this purple sweater it is
from Toby and it is a purple black and
white and again it is longer but it's
not too long that it's a dress I've only
won this once actually so it's still in
like perfect condition and it definitely
keeps you warm for the winter I don't
know about you guys but I live in North
Carolina and today we were supposed to
start class but it snowed about a
quarter of an inch so they canceled it
the next thing I'm gonna move away it's
really cute sweater I've actually
included this in one of my look books
before throwback to like me in high
school I put this in one of my look
books it's really really cute like
Christmasy sweater it's from American
Eagle and I think I've only worn this
like twice so it's still all the clothes
I'm giving away are in great condition
you guys the next thing that I'm giving
away is this other sweater it has
stripes and it's beige and has a cute
little pocket this one is more of like a
shirt sweater so it's not long and it's
not cropped but it's quarter sleeve next
thing that I'm giving away its this
sweater and a lot of sizes you guys it
is from winter and it's really really
cute it doesn't keep you as warm because
it's a little thinner but the sleeves
are along and it's kind of longer more
like
to Nick again but it's just a clean
color and I actually really really like
this I just it's been really hard to
kind of give stuff away I just feel like
I have too many clothes and I feel like
I should actually make some use out of
them and if I don't wear them all the
time then I'm just trying to like give
them to you guys next letter is from
forever 21 and it is this beige one this
one used to be my favorite I've worn
this quite a bit but it's still in great
condition there's no holes there's no
like poles or on any of like threads or
anything and it's like beige and tan
next one is from American Eagle and it's
really fun and it's purple and like
Christmas II and I know it's not
Christmas anymore but I still feel like
this is great for the winter time it's
show cozy and it actually has fur in the
hood it's just like a great great
sweaters so those are all of the like
sweaters that you will be able to wear
now I hope you guys like this video by
the way this is such a like a random
like I didn't know if you guys would
like it but I really hope that you guys
do because I think it's a cool idea
doing like a reverse haul instead of
just telling you guys I'm selling my
clothes and actually like showing you
guys what I'm selling I don't know if
that makes sense
some other long-sleeve shirts that I'm
selling are this is from three people
you guys know my obsession with Free
People it's like a gray and see-through
ish and it's long so it's what a tunic I
guess you can say it's tighter at the
top and kind of flows out towards the
bottom and then it's also like half
sleeve I wouldn't call this quarter
sleeve it like goes up to your elbow and
it has this plum color
I think it's shoukyou and three people
is my obsession the next thing that I'm
selling is this red dress and it's
actually a dress not a shirt but it is a
turtleneck ish it's like a half
turtleneck because it doesn't go all the
way up and then I don't know what it is
called
and then it's a long sleeve and tight
and this is like beautiful you guys I
love this I've only won this one once as
well and I didn't know but I won does
something like that you can have white
at once I think I've shown you guys this
in a lookbook but yeah so I got this for
a lookbook so it's in perfect condition
if you guys want to see it on Poshmark I
don't have all of these down below
obviously these are all going and then
this I feel like it's gonna be like a
hot seller like it will probably sell
quickly because it is from brandy
melville and I got it this year and I've
only worn it once and I don't really
know why I just like was not in love
with it even though I love with other
people wear it I just wasn't in love
with this that's why I decided to sell
it because I only wore it once and I got
it this summer so I could have worn it
multiple times but it is this
long-sleeve shirt and like chiffon
material and it has a tie right here so
we're like open up but it has to tie
right there and it's not cropped just
like a normal length it keeps you really
cool it's not like a winter shirt
I love the opening and I think that was
like my favorite favorite part of it I
got that from brandy melville this year
and I only weren't once like I said so
it is literally in perfect condition all
right I'm gonna run through some of
these really quickly it's so power mode
because like so much to show you guys I
don't want this video to be 20 minutes
long I'm giving away this romper it's
just striped and short sleeve it from
Urban Outfitters again I've won this one
once you guys I know I have a problem
but that's why I'm trying to make good
of it and keep it away this dress my
obsession it is from Free People I've
worn this ploy of it and it's a couple
of years old so you're not gonna find
any one with this anymore
it has a ruffle sleeves and it's like
the most pretty detailing and also this
was in Seventeen magazine you guys
because when I was in Seventeen magazine
I was in like on their Style Council and
I was in a couple of there
I wore this on there so if you want to
be like fashion-forward totally get this
it's very like 70s inspired next I am
giving away this dress it's from BCBG I
have to love it it's like a great
t-shirt material on top and then this
black and white and gray ruffles on the
bottom and it's exception is at the
waist I also got this here and I've only
worn it once it is this red dress from
forever 21 it has the crisscross
material right here I've actually showed
this in one of my calls this year so
this is brand spankin new and it's
excellent condition and like I could
return this to everyone
the next thing I'm giving away is this
rapper from Urban Outfitters it's show
so so cute it is aquamarine you know
blue type aqua mermaid instead of color
if it has like little flowers all over
it and it is a halter ish neck with and
you basically open back and it's just a
really really delicate and dainty and
cute and it's like that chiffon the next
thing I'm getting the way I got also
this weird it is a suede dress from
forever 21 it's super super cute and it
has pockets it's very 70s Coachella
inspired but it's all suede and I'm
obsessed it was another thing I showed
this year in a hall and it is this
bright pink dress it's so so cute it's a
v-neck and a hat I like you know things
that cover your boobs basically on the
side and it's all suede the next dress
that I'm giving away is this silk nude
dress it's just a really really pretty
and delicate and it has that like like
tool material at the bottom and then
crochet at the top the next is from Free
People this is a tunic and it has criss
cross at the top of like right here in
front and it's a little sentiment but
not too much and then it has this like
crochet at the bottom super super cute
next thing I'm giving away is this
killer gold leather jacket so this one
is super super cool I just never really
had anything to wear it with or I kind
of just forgot I had it in my closet but
I love this and I
please show this in a hall last year so
you guys those are just a couple of the
things I didn't want to show you
everything because I want you guys to
actually check out my closet all
Poshmark haha till you guys always
secrets but yeah those are just a couple
of the things that you guys can see on
my closet so I really really hope that
you guys take the time to buy this stuff
because I'm gonna be selling it for
really really cheap it's so easy to sell
on Poshmark so please use my referral
code to open up your account and make
purchase or sell things I would love to
share your guys's listings so so easy to
post anything on Poshmark
i'll show you guys how to do it but
basically you just snap picture of your
item you upload it you write a
description you write the size the
quantity the color whatever your price
you set the price what I do is I think
of how much I bought it for how old it
is how many uses I did and also I know
if it's always like five dollars off
from when I bought it for it and no
one's gonna want to buy it because you
can find definitely find something like
that way cheaper I typically like doing
about 40% off of what I originally got
it for I think that's a pretty good deal
and then you keep 10% of whatever sells
so if something sells for $100 you're
gonna keep $90 really great deal I like
this app I've tried a lot of other like
consignment store apps and this is just
my favorite it's just the easiest and I
already have a following on it so it's
just easier for me to sell things um but
yeah I just sold something like last
week on it in the same day that I posted
it so it's just great uh yeah I highly
recommend that you guys try it out
yourself and be sure to use my code and
yeah I hope that this video was a little
bit more entertaining for you guys to
see like what I bought it said it's just
me announcing that I like my clothes um
next week I'm actually gonna be started
doing like video requests things and
real like YouTube videos that you guys
want to see and I'm so excited for it I
feel like I do better when I'm at school
and like I have like a schedule and
stuff so I'm so excited you guys if you
guys cannot tell and I have actually a
really exciting announcement that's
coming Saturday so be sure that you are
a subscriber
