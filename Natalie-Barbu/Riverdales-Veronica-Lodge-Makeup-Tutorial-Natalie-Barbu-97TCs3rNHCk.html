am filming this Veronica Lodge inspired
makeup tutorial I hope that you guys
like it
I just wanted to give a big THANK YOU to
you guys because I have gotten so so so
so many comments on me that I look like
Veronica Lodge from Riverdale and I had
no idea that that was and then I looked
it up and I was like I do not look like
her at all I don't know you guys are
talking about she is such darker
features than me and then I started
watching the show and I became obsessed
with it so if it wasn't for you guys I
wouldn't have started the show and I
wouldn't become as obsessed as I did
please give this video a big thumbs up
if you guys like Riverdale and any other
videos that you guys want to see also it
would mean the world to me if you guys
would tweet her this makeup tutorial if
you guys like it please do that I would
be so ecstatic if she saw this she's
such a beautiful person so thank you
guys so much for saying that they look
like her because like I think she's
gorgeous so yeah let me know or like
tweet her please that'd be so cool if
you guys do it just to hear like
screenshots of the video and then send
them to her and if you do that I will
retweet you I will follow you on twitter
like please I hope that you guys enjoyed
this makeup tutorial subscribe if you're
new and less concerned we're going to
start off with a very clean and
exfoliated face so before I started the
makeup tutorial I actually let this glam
glow brightening mask sit on my face for
about 30 minutes and it's just
exfoliates so you rub it in you make
sure that it really like gets all that
dead skin off of your face and then you
leave it on for about 20-30 minutes
however long you want and so I did that
because I am NOT using highlighter in
this video and if you guys know me at
all you know I love using highlighter
and it is my favorite part of my makeup
tutorial but since we are doing a
Veronica Lodge inspired tutorial I don't
think she really wears how much
highlighter I've never seen her have
like glitter or anything on so I really
didn't want to do that so I want to make
sure my base was extremely healthy
hydrated and glowing so that we don't
look dull so to start off with the
makeup I am taking first my Mario
Badescu facial spray this is just going
to set my face
find that just to make sure that my
makeup stays on all day it's not really
it doesn't really do much but it just
feels really good I'm going to start
with the foundation and you guys can use
any foundation that you guys want I am
using Makeup Forever HD foundation this
has been my go-to lately applying that
all over my face
once you have blended that all in i am
seeking i maybelline concealer and i am
just applying that underneath my eyes
and what I can see Veronica is very
clear skin so everything is just like
she looks flawless so that is what we
are looking for but I have noticed she
is a little darker as in like more like
edgy so she doesn't have like
highlighter and brightness and pop sub
like color on her face you know so that
is why we are just going to try to make
the base as perfect as possible because
I feel like that's the number one thing
about her she's not as like glowy or
anything like that like her main thing
is her eyebrows definitely but her face
is always so clear we just want to make
sure that our face is clear but not
taking anything next I am taking my
Laura Mercier foundation or translucent
powder and I am going to be applying
that with my Beauty Blender underneath
my eyes so it's kind of going to be
baking but it's just so that it doesn't
crease or anything because that would
not be good and I feel like her face is
more mass than anything else I don't
know I could be totally wrong if the
make barda swatches this let me know but
as we are waiting for that to set I am
actually going to take my Revlon
Colorstay powder this is a pressed
powder and I'm going to putting that all
over my face just to make sure my makeup
is set and that it doesn't crease and
doesn't get oily throughout the day so
I'm just going to kind of go around the
press or the loose powder and put that
on
and now as we wait for our under eyes to
kind of bake we are going to go on to
the eyebrow which i think is is the most
important part so for the eyebrows I'm
kind of nervous to do it because that's
like such a big feature of hers and I
don't want to mess them up but I have
pretty dark and arched eyebrows already
I feel like that is the main reason why
people say that we look alike is because
our eyebrows are very similar so I am
going to do kind of my own eyebrows but
I'm going to make them come darker
towards the middle because hers are kind
of dark throughout and they are kind of
close together not like super close
together but they definitely come in
more than they are away from each other
and I am just going to make sure that
they are super dark but not true dark
where it looks like you're drawn on so I
am using the brow Wow from benefit I
think this one will do the best job
because it is more precise it's not like
a gel that kind of it's just like spread
throughout the whole thing so I'm going
to do hair like strokes with it and
brush my eyebrows out first because that
is the number one thing you guys got to
do that but you need to brush out your
eyebrows such a crucial step so yes see
I have no makeup on and they're already
pretty dark and pointy but I hope I
don't do / going to be bringing it with
like hair like strokes towards the
middle I'm going to start gentle because
I don't want it to be like a block look
I hate when people have like boxes of
their eyebrows so just each individual
stroke
all right and now I'm going to brush
them up and I know they look super dark
but with the rest of the makeup on they
will assign if not I'll take some of it
off but I think that it will look like
her eyebrows are so dark you guys
of the way I'm brushing them to make
sure that they're blended so as you do
it just make sure you brush up
throughout just to make sure that
they're blended as for the art I just
followed my natural shape if you guys
don't have any eyebrows I would
definitely recommend a stencil but I
just followed my natural shade because I
think that they are pretty similar and
then I just dragged out the end a little
bit and then the Len did it and I kind
of blend it with my finger - I like
moving along there to make it look more
natural I'm going to brush this product
off of my eyes I think that's enough
Veronica is not very dark as in like
super tan she is Hispanic but she her
skin tone is not that tan so I am just
going to contour just to make my face
more sharp so her face is very sharp
from what I've noticed her chin is very
sharp her nose is very sharp like
everything to her this is very like
sharp I guess that's the best word to
describe it so I'm just going to contour
for that I'm not really going to contour
to be like glowing and bronze and
whenever I'm just going to contour to
make my face shape a little more like
I'm actually going to start with a
smaller brush we are first going to come
with our cheekbones and circle the
bronzer in there
add for the nose I am going to contour
down the sides of it to make my nose a
little skinnier and pointy err with a
very light hand I'm bringing the bronzer
up kind of to my eyebrow on the side
just to make it look more natural not
just like there's two Brown lines on the
sides of my nose I am using this deck of
scarlet palette I really love Decker
Scarlett so it is a makeup company that
is actually a subscription service and I
believe it's four times a year that I
will clarify with you guys and funny
enough a youtuber collaborates with them
each month so Bub's beauty actually did
this one so that's really really cool so
they only collaborate with big youtubers
to create makeup powers so I thought
that was pretty interesting because
hello I'm a youtuber that'd be awesome
if I could create my own palette but
today this is the best Veronica palette
because there's a lot of purple and
purple is her color so I for my blush
I'm going to be using this body color so
this big like deep purple color I'll be
using as blush but we are going to have
the lightest and because we do not want
to look like a clown I'm barely tapping
like literally barely tapped at once and
I'm going to put that on the apples of
my cheeks and blend it up
and that's going to be the blush that we
will be using and that is it for the
stick I will first be priming my eyes
because you makeups got to stay on all
day long
so you just want to make sure that you
prime it I'm also going to be using this
white color as a base it is vanilla by
Mac this is just going to be a good eye
shadow base just to make sure that we
have a very light color all over my lid
and I'm bringing that up to the brow
bone I'm going to be taking the bronzer
that we used for our face and I'm going
to be lightly using that as a transition
color for our eye shadow I'm just going
to lightly going to be blending that
into the crease just to kind of make our
crease look more Hollow and a little
deeper she does have deeper set eyes so
this is just going to add some dimension
to it so just apply that there we're
going to go in with a deck of scarlet
palette and we are going to be using
this middle purple color and we are just
going to be putting that directly into
the crease with a very small crease
brush I am just going to be putting this
directly into my crease because she does
wear dark brows and Purple's a lot I can
notice so we just want to build this up
to give it a darker look
and then with a relending
brush after we're done with that we're
just going to lightly blend everything
out because the last thing you want is
on blended eyeshadow so without any
color or anything just run your brush
across your lid and make sure that it's
all blended and there's no harsh lines
after eyeliner I'm using a Kat Von D
liquid eyeliner and I'm just going to be
doing that on the top lashline and just
doing a little tiny wing really going to
try hard not to shake and to stay in the
frame but I can't promise and I would
curl my lashes and wear mascaras now as
for the lips
so this deck of scarlet palette actually
had a section right here which is super
cute it opens up on both sides for the
lips and we are actually going to be
mixing these two colors together so
first I will be applying this brown
color and then I will be applying the
purple because she does have deeper lips
normally it's a deeper color it's not
like a pink or anything
I will first be lining my lips with this
Mac liquid liquid this Mac lip liner in
the color world and I will be lining
them she doesn't necessarily have big
lips but she does have more of like a V
on her Cupid's bow so we're going to try
to make that a little and more defined
and I'm taking a lip brush and I will be
applying that onto my lips very
carefully
now a little bit of the purple color on
top
fam obsessed with this lip color I'm
going to start using this like every day
so this is the finished makeup products
I hope that you guys think I look like
Veronica a little more with this or I
helped you guys kind of look like her a
little bit I personally used to not see
it at all but after I started watching
every day and I finished it I could kind
of see that I looked like her a little
bit but I love this makeup tutorial I
think she would totally wear this if you
guys would do me a huge favor and
actually tweet her this makeup tutorial
camilla mendes that would be so much to
me that would be so cool she could see
it because i think she is such a
beautiful person and i would love for
her to see this please tweet her and if
you do tweet me if you recreate this do
that make sure to follow me on all my
social media and bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
