morning Amsterdam is I'm starting my day
off at Starbucks in France and I don't
know why it's not focusing so I moved to
places so now I am asus cafe it's like
this internet cafe and it's actually
really cute it's called fancy cafe and
it's five euros for every hour and you
get unlimited drinks and snacks so I
think that's awesome and the light is
going so fast I was at Starbucks for 30
minutes it only it only uploaded 6% I've
been here for two minutes and it's
already at 76 77 78 79 it's going up in
a second so this place is awesome if
you're ever in Paris please come here
and support this local business and I
wish things would pop up like this more
in the US where like it's only like 10
dollars let's say ten dollars for an
hour and you get unlimited coffee snacks
and Wi-Fi I feel like that's just like a
really cute concept and like the place
itself is super super nice it's a really
gloomy day in Paris
but this is my oh my god I went to three
minutes already at 94 95 it's about to
be done this is insane I've never
actually seen this a so this is great
we're at the Louvre
they're pretending like they're running
at the loo
walking to the Mona Lisa
what do you think this should be the
famous painting on that little tiny
thing
you guys Darby and I are at this cafe
and we got quiche and brie cheese with
bread and she got a martini and I got
some rosy and quiche green beans like
salad this looks amazing
chocolate it all looks so good a little
boutique in Paris called Michael loose
so closee I don't know and we are here
for the macaroons though look at how
good they look and I have yet to get
macaroons in Paris so this will be my
first time really missed my flight this
morning but I'm here now I got a train
and I'm here and it's very pretty and
now we're about to explore and yeah
that's what we're doing
Amsterdam is this is just like The Fault
in Our Stars have you seen that movie
so pretty we are in like a central part
of Amsterdam what is this called like a
square or quarter I'm at Starbucks and
this I thought was really cool so they
like show you everything in the smoothie
before and then they blend it
whoa I thought that was really cool
interesting this one's very similar to
France but in Amsterdam it's like a food
truck place but like non food trucks but
I had a bunch of little shops like like
a little market as much little shops
from like every other country or just a
lot of different food lots of bars super
super trendy it really feels like I'm
actually back at home we're obsessed a
it is so so cute and it's so crowded
it's only I think two today and it's
like so so crowded but
it's really nice I definitely didn't
have my expectations
or being a pretty small city but it's
really really nice and I'm excited that
I am that actually got to witness to
myself I would love to know what you
guys think have you ever been here
yeah I think I had higher expectations
because I think I'm coming from Paris
which i think is a million times better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
