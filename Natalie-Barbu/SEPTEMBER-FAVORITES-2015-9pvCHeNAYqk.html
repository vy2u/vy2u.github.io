i'm filming a September favorites for
you guys and this is probably the first
time I've filmed a favorites video that
isn't like a week and a half two weeks
after the favorites it's actually still
September so that's really exciting and
I say this every single favorites video
is pretty repetitive but this month went
by really fast this is my first full
month in as a sophomore in college and
it honestly has not been that great if
I'm being honest um I think we all have
our bad months and we'll have a good one
and in terms of strictly school this
month has not been that great but in
terms of just enjoyment overall it's
been pretty good so yeah in terms of
school so I'm in the grey enjoyment to
refine let me know if you guys feel that
like if you guys understand what I'm
saying so I'm going to be showing you
guys what does my grandma's favorite
throughout the month absent ever happen
but let's just get certain we are
actually going to start with makeup but
rest assured it's only one makeup
product so my favorite makeup product of
the month is the naked Urban Decay's
smoky palette pretty basic I know I feel
like a lot of girls have this but it
really is my favorite I've been
consistently using it through the month
of September and it just has a ton of
really really pretty colors and I don't
know I just feel like I can get an
everyday look out of this and I can also
get smokey eye shadow goes out of this
so it's the best of both and I think
this is the naked palettes best
aesthetically pleasing palette like the
way it looks on the outside and then
naked too with my least favorite in
terms of looks um but yeah I really like
the way that this one looks like
cool like I like doing this stupid my
next favorite is going to be a hair
product and right now i just have super
natural hair it's been really raining
outside so it might be a little bit for
these but it's actually not really for
me compared to how it normally is it
because it was promised so reckon I got
out of shower I always took this product
in it is john frieda frizz-ease daily
nourishment leave-in conditioner it's
awesome it rocks I really really like it
I think it's just a really great leave
in conditioner I just spray it all over
our hair and then I come out and it
totally detangles it and yeah my hair
has never been more soft unless I use
this so i highly recommend us especially
because now it's starting to get all
gross and rainy outside so you
definitely something to not get your
hands busy and then my neck surgeries
clothing including is always find so i'm
going to try this on because I literally
cannot show you on here it's just it's
one of those smoothies v-neck things I
absolutely love the sweepy like zv with
a backless um slick DP that's backless I
think those are so cute you can barely
tell I always have to safety pin it but
it's really really cute and I really
love it I think it's perfect for
September it was great for going out it
was also great just for like you can
just up you can just down high and
really love this top I link it down
below and it's from she inside so make
sure that you click on it if you guys
want to see how much is there like how
to get it cuz it's super cheap and she
inside is so choice but yeah this is the
best way to see how it looks is super
cute I have been loving it
and yeah I have always wanted one of
these but for cheap and I finally found
one on shoe size my next favorite is a
school supply and since it is beginning
of the school year I thought this is
spinning so it is the air and contrary
and a planner and I had a planner in my
last ones but it was not this one but I
talked about this one and I got this one
it says my name on it personalized super
cute it I got black and white just
because black and white are basically my
two favorite colors that I like to
wearing so I felt like you went with
everything so I just got black and white
personalized one and it's pretty sick
planner I don't do anything crazy with
it I don't like scrapbook or anything
but I just have like my calendar with my
month by month and then i'll have like
all my things to do i do separate into
school life and youtube so if see it's a
little bit busy yeah i just separate it
with my homework assignment school life
youtube just random things that i have
it going on i will just write it down in
my planner aid this is the enemy's
planner i have had that has actually
made me organized it's the only thing
I've actually used I don't know if it's
because it still look big and pretty or
something but I am obsessed today I'm
definitely by next year it is very
pricey for later like extremely pricey
and some people like if I tell them the
price level why the heck would everybody
plant over that much money but I don't
know it works for me and I used my own
one of money for it so whatever guy my
next favorite thing is actually going to
be a book and I think my favorite book
is the wild in the hollows by amber C
hands it's a new book it came out last
month and it is actually a kind of like
a memoir about this lady really I
related to it in a very like I've never
related to anything more and not that
our stories of saying that just I could
understand
emotions and it's very raw and just I
love how honest she was and it wasn't
something like like oh like I'm perfect
or okay this looks like the complete
opposite i feel it's really relatable
for a lot of girls on any age at all but
yeah i love this book I am hired minded
to anyone who's just kind of feeling
like they are broken or they just feel
like they have done wrong and don't feel
loved and more or anything like that
because it's so not true and I think
it's going away table for a lot of girls
so I will link everything down below so
you can check cashed my next favorite is
going to be some apps / websites so I
would pull out my phone and I would have
to get a new case because it's not
summer anymore so I don't want the
pineapple case but I do really love the
pineapple base but my favorite apps on
my phone all I want to see okay so
obviously an Instagram is my favorite
that's just the best you know so follow
me on instagram guys it's great and my
second favorite app is going to be
facebook / my new website so in case you
had to know I mean I best friend Katie
and recently opened or started a website
called becoming brooded calm and it's
just a community for girls that feel
alone or feel unless kind of like the
book I was talking about and just to let
you know you guys are not alone in your
feelings we want to be kind of an order
sister or a mentor to you guys and let
you know that there is hope and there's
hope in God and that they are sloping
just in life and you guys are not alone
in your journey I know we both have been
through struggles and we both understand
how much hard high school is and you
know that your parents don't get that
and we're the generation that has
changed the most like I don't think
anyone can relate to us as much as we
can
because you have technology and
unfortunately it's the social media has
a huge huge huge effect on our lives I
mean I basically live on social media so
we just kind of wanted to make a website
for girls that feel alone or feel like
they enjoy to relay to or they don't
have an older sister they don't have a
friend or they just want someone to talk
to anonymously so yeah we have that
website for you guys so definitely check
it out I will link that down below too
but coming through did it is I just want
to show you guys like part facebook page
