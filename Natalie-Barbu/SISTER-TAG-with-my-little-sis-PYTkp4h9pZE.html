ever grow to stay this little
oh darling don't you ever grow
don't you ever grow up it could stay
this simple hey everyone so today I am
doing a sister tag with my little sister
Chloe nice Chloe
and so I just decided to do a sister tag
I actually have an older sister as well
she is at work right now she's a nurse
but I'm thinking of doing another video
with her just not this tag exactly so
anyways we're just gonna jump right into
the questions and I have my laptop right
here with all the questions on first
question how old are you both I am 18
years old and yes I'm actually older
than her so that's a shock I'm 13 yeah I
always get that she's older than me and
I'm five years older than her so it's
kind of embarrassing describe each other
in one word probably like independent
because I don't know you like to be on
your own
do your own thing that you don't like
other people her I would say much her I
would say just because it's not only she
looks with her not only does she look
mature but she is in middle school I
don't think I I was like nah gonna level
in middle school I don't think we live
it friends if we were in middle school
together so yeah I would just say she is
more mature for her age do people ever
get you mixed up
No I got confused as Natalie bye-bye
like just random people not like her
YouTube fans because no no but just
family friends I guess for like oh they
get confused between uses me yeah I like
sometimes though because I'll see us
walking or something oh I thought you
were Natalie or oh is that your Chloe
but like not enough to talk to us and
think we're like the other person yeah
what is something that annoys you about
one another um maybe she's very like has
to do stuff her way sometimes which I
could say the same for me so I guess
we're similar on that but yeah like if
she tells me like oh can you take me
here and I take like five minutes for
like started freaking out so that's not
true yeah I used to do that too and I
didn't have my license and I really
still do that today when my mom takes me
places so I don't really have much to
say in that um she's very messy very
messy and we do share a bathroom and I
always get blamed for his stuff she
leaves like my mom walks in and she
starts screaming at me and that's now
like that's not hmm all the time what is
it like being what's it like being
sisters with a YouTube guru um I mean I
don't think it's really any different I
mean it's cool of it she can make videos
but and thumbs us up if you want her to
start making videos cuz she does her
makeup better than I do and she does all
these like weird things with her makeup
like when she's like just playing not
like out like she's like does really
cool things so thumbs up if you want her
to start once I'm trying to convince it
Thanks next question is do you guys ever
argue yeah we do I would say yes but not
that it's not like anything that we
don't talk to each other for days it's
like some stuff um what's the best thing
about one another it's just a member
being bored because you always have
someone yes it's better now that we're
both older so we can actually like talk
instead of like yeah if I was like 15
and she was like ten yeah I mean I like
that I can talk to her about stuff but I
can't talk to this next question says
ditch the dirt I don't really know that
means it means like spill the beans
okay I don't know am i bad to say about
you favorite inside joke
you can think we have any inside jokes
but I really don't think we do um
favorite memory together I would
probably say like when we were younger
we used to do these things like NCL
times
yeah and that was our little brother to
Lucas and so it was badly Chloe Lucas
times and I would film on my Apple
computer cuz I mean this wasn't like
sixth grade as you can tell she's more
mature than me because in six year I
don't even stuff I had like an Apple
laptop I like make videos and we do like
in these shows and like skits and half
it of the we like the weather report and
like we wouldn't make that I would like
edit them like put them together and
everything and then we would present
them to our parents like for pro to our
like parents and Families and like we
really make them all come upstairs and
watch them and they were
so lame but oh so much we still got them
yeah yeah like our theme song was like
welcome to the NCL times like every
night I've been running my eyes okay
both sisters have sisters or stepsisters
we under full sisters guess each other's
favorite singer I know you range from
like Taylor Swift and the adventure club
yeah I don't really have a favorite
singer um try think yeah honestly no I
like everyone or any like good music I
like I don't follow an artist so just
gonna go with whatever musically
I mean I guess mine same thing I listen
to a lot of her music because my phone
doesn't let me download music I know
it's a whole different story anyways so
it takes longer to get ready
I wouldn't say closes yeah I like to
take my time
she doesn't even wear makeup most days
and she takes longer than me yeah heels
or flats I normally wear flats yeah I
normally wear flats because I'm five
five and a half so it made me even
taller but if I wear heels but I like
heels a lot
yeah she's five five and a half and I am
five two two five three pants or dresses
I like dresses I wear dressing this all
the time I love this I'd say pants I
like dresses favorite animal my favorite
animal just like animal in general is an
elephant but I like dogs and cats too as
like just playing with them yeah I don't
know I like I like cats and dogs okay if
your house is burning down and your
entire family was sure to be okay what
would you take and why um I would take
my own
and my laptop actually I bought in my
phone more than my laptop just because I
have up I've already taken my phone my
life is on my phone and I would honestly
I'm assuming our pets are part of the
family so I would try to get like
picture frames member albums maybe also
clothing that I like and that sounds
really dumb but yeah
comedy or or chick flick I like comedy
movies comedy is my fave feather chick
flick Blackberry or iPhone I don't know
what shot was made but yeah I thought
I'm favorite movie I really liked just
like the comedy like bridesmaids Mean

those movies but I like oh I love home

like Nicholas Sparks just anything like
in that realm so what is something weird
that you meet um my favorite food would
probably be like a cankles
so if pickles counts as a weird food
then I guess that's something weird that
I eat but I like pickles I mean I'll eat

not like living and you put it in front
of me so do you guys have anything
