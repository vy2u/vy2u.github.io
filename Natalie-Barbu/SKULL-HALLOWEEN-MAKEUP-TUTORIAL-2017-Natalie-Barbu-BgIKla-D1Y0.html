Halloween tutorial of the year and it is
this skull I think it's super super cool
and I've always wanted to do this and
comment down below you guys think I
should be this for Halloween or what
other tutorials you want me to do in the
next week but without further ado let's
just get started into the tutorial so I
am starting off with just a clean face
and I already did my eyes it's just a
classic smokey eye and I am taking a
white eye shadow pencil and I am lining
the outline of my skull with it I'm
using this pencil because it's super
easy to smudge away if you mess up so
it's not anything permanent and I'm just
doing this little outline with a v-shape
on my nose and then I am taking a paint
brush and applying face paint all over
the bottom half of my face and I
actually recommend getting a better face
paint that I did I'll link the one that
I got down below it's from Amazon and
you gotta get it wet for it to activate
and like it's a hard paint I don't know
it's really weird but I really didn't
like it I feel like you could see my
skin through a lot of it it was super
cheap but again I think if you actually
want to wear this out for Halloween not
just five minutes for tutorial I
definitely would recommend getting a
better paint and then I am taking this
black paint and I am lining the
underneath of my eyes and this is just
going to create kind of like the hollows
or the shadows underneath my eyes and
I'm lightly lightly doing it because I
don't know if I'm gonna like it or not
so if I don't like it I can quickly go
over it but I did so then I'm going to
apply a little more pressure underneath
where I did it so this is kind of
supposed to be like your eye sockets or
something like that mimicking that and
then having a kind of a shadow cast
underneath it and I used the same paint
that I used for my face for my white
face paint and in the black I got the
same brand and I really didn't like it's
not really as black as I would like and
it's very see-through and kind of once
your face gets oily it kind of breaks
apart so I would definitely recommend
getting a better one than this and then
I am just applying it to my nose and it
is very very light but I like that
because I like to have an outline
because in case I don't like it again
and then I am wetting the brush a little
more and applying it
by patting it I feel like this is the
best way to apply this specific paint so
I am patting it on my nose and again I'm
trying to outline the v-shape on the top
of it just to make it look more like a
skull
I used inspiration from other youtubers
and from photos I saw on Pinterest so if
this looks similar to any one that
you've seen or anything let me know down
below and I will give them credit
because they don't really know who I
watched her whose pictures I saw but I
just took a bunch of inspiration from a
bunch of different photos and then I am
drawing my mouth so just from the mouth
you're gonna go on the edges and draw a
very very skinny line and I am applying
pressure to that because I want it to be
dark and now I am going in with the
contour so I'm basically just outlining
my cheekbones I'm trying to make it
curved a little bit more to give it more
of a skull like look I guess I'm just
outlining my cheekbones with the black
paint and seeing how that looks and then
eventually if I like it I am going to
start filling it in with the black paint
this black paint basically looks grey
I've noticed you have to apply a lot of
it and get it really really wet for it
to look black but I am just going to be
filling it in and I'm going to be
applying more pressure at the top and
some edges and less pressure on once I
start filling it in because that's gonna
give it more definition and more of a
dimension it's gonna make it look a
little more 3d like you actually really
do have hollows because if it was all
the same color it would look more like
paint and less like oh those are
actually holes on your skin if that
makes any sense so afterwards I am going
in with the black face paint again and I
am going to outline the very edges and
now I am going in and drawing the teeth
and half the time or at least in the
beginning I was out of focus and out of
the frame so if you guys can tell this
is my first Halloween tutorial this year
this is a very very intense one but I am
drawing this Heath and I'm gonna trying
super super skinny lines and actually
they're not that skinny and I should
have used a skinnier one but guys this
is hard to perfect but the good thing
about it is that it does not need to be
perfect because it really like you
really really cannot tell and I'm so
sorry though the camera is going in and
out of focus a lot this makeup tutorial
had a lot of technical difficulties if
you guys can't tell and now I'm just
making the teeth look more like teeth so
I am drawing the roots of them and I'm
doing that super super lightly so I will
never get my
paint or my brush in the paint again
because I don't want it to be black or
harsh I just want it to be very very
light so it's a light finger I am just
making the lines and you really don't
have to be perfect on this I was super
super messy because you can't really
tell as long as you have roots and I'm
taking a black eyeshadow and I am kind
of contouring I guess where I drew my
cheekbones and I am mainly doing it on
the outside again to have more of a
definition and let's make it look like
they're more hollowed out so I'm
focusing it on the top and on the edges
and I think that it makes it look so
much better and the powder from the
eyeshadow actually can help set it so it
makes it look a little better in general
and then I'm applying it the same
eyeshadow underneath where I drew the
eye sockets it just makes it look more
realistic
I guess this realistic as a skull can
look on your face and it's just also
going to set it's a little more but I
thought the powder added a nice
different texture to it instead of just
using paint it's kind of hard to get
more real look I was about to say
natural but nothing about this is
natural um and then I'm going in and I'm
going to be applying kind of like um the
gums I guess I'm trying to draw so with
my black face paint and just a tiny tiny
bit I'm just drawing black above the
teeth to make it look like the gums and
just to make it look more defined
because I felt like you couldn't really
tell that these were teeth before I did
this and again you do not have to be me
I am a complete amateur you guys so
please no mean comments in the comments
below but accidentally it smudged some
black off-camera um on top of my teeth
so I wanted to apply a little more paint
so that's why I tapped it there and then
I am drawing cracks on my skull again to
just give it some more
I guess I'm character to it and so I'm
drawing skinny black lines on my chin
and I got this inspiration from a
Pinterest photo and it makes it look
like the skull is being cracked this is
probably my favorite part of it I think
it looks really really cool and it kind
of just tops off the whole look so you
do this at the end and then again I am
going in and I'm defining all my lines
because I really want to have sharp
lines on my face so I am applying it
through the eye sockets and pressing
really hard with my brush again I would
recommend a better paint because this
paint was basically great it was not
black at all I wish that they would have
told me that but whatever it's fine now
I know so definitely get a paint that's
like black black black but it still
worked out and then that is actually I
was about to say that is it that is not
it we're going back in with the powder
um and so now we're going back in with
me contouring for the eyes and I am
actually applying it underneath my chin
and underneath my jawline to make it
seem more like a contour because when I
apply bronzer I apply it underneath my
jawline that's one of the places and if
you just smudge a little black under
there I think it makes it look really
cool and it makes you look like you're
cracking more or anything like that so I
really really really like it and then if
you have any white on you you can cover
that up with the black powder but that
is it's now for my video and I hope you
guys liked it give it a thumbs up if you
did subscribe down below if you're not
