I am filling a different video than what
I normally do I've never done one of
these funny videos but I'm really
excited for it because I think it's
pretty funny
a lot of you guys will relate to it so
the video is social media then versus
now and if you guys have been living
under a rock you know how much social
media has changed I think it has just
evolved into something super casual to
something that we take very very
seriously so that means that I am just
going to hop right into the video
so far the first social media one I
wanted to do Instagram because that is I
feel like the most popular one right now
at least for me I love Instagram and
back then it used to be like I didn't
even know what followers were on an
Instagram I would edit like a million
pictures and upload all of them at once
and it just like was not good quality
that the ending was like the one with
that filter called the yellow one you
guys know which one's the yellow with
the Instagram borders around it yeah
that was that was my oh we are I love
are those your paint yeah I just got
that my new and your hollister tank up
thank you so cute get in the frame
oh my god these are so you I I like them
all I think all unto okay I'm just gonna
happen all into Instagram there's this
new up you literally just like uploaded
pictures so it's kind of like Facebook
but just for patience I wanna get one
yeah it's called Instagram Instagram
today though is quite different a lot of
editing a lot of taking seriously um I
feel like your makeup always us to be
carpet it's a hair has to be perfect and
everything has to be so setup you take a
million pictures and you only choose one
of them but you still edit like all of
them this is such good lighting okay so
my makeup is on point to build my
eyebrows in alright get that fit in the
picture so everyone knows I exercise
wait I like all of these pictures but I
can only choose one okay so I'm gonna
text stitch my five closest friends and
ask them which one they like the best
after I edit it in perfect
before and after so much better now it
matches my theme YouTube back then so I
started and go - oh I started these you
give me good old days of YouTube and I
mean good old days just because it was
the beginning but I started and I
stopped for some time but like I started
back then and I just remember filming
with my MacBook and I remember not
knowing how to edit at all editing
everything on iMovie and which I maybe I
am used up until like this year but
editing everything on there like macbook
quality and didn't know any what I was
doing I remember watching other
youtubers and I try can
but yeah I was so today I am filming a
makeup tutorial um it was like just I
just felt like doing it I'm doing a
celebrity one so this is like glamorous
I think I want to do Selena Gomez so
today I'm doing a Selena Gomez Sanket
tutorial yeah so I'm using this brush
yeah it's just like a big brush from
techniques I think you can just get out
of Target or something so basically what
you're just gonna do is dip any powder
you want any one that matches your face
and you're just gonna put it on your
skin like so should I get closer to the
camera okay so do you see like what I'm
doing just basically do exactly what I'm
doing
sorry I'm not looking at you I'm just
looking at myself as you kids how like
this totally looks like Selena Gomez cuz
Selena Gomez wears powder on her face
and I just put powder on my face so much
for watching guys um make sure that you
can leave a video response if you try
out this look because I totally watch
all the video responses that you guys do
and yet leave a comment but mainly video
response so yeah can't wait to watch
those bye guys
now basically everyone has Final Cut Pro
everyone has a DSLR camera super nice
quality spend thousands of dollars on
lenses rig light tripods a studio lights
literally so much like so many high
quality things but yeah you obviously
don't need all that but that is what a
lot of people today use but in the
editing it's like always on point with
music in the background like saturated
film super quality slow motion doing the
hair flip thing you guys you know you
guys know
I'm missing the sound of your heartbeat
Facebook back in the day was the not og
social media but it was one of the og
social medias I would say myspace was og
social media but anyways Facebook was
just I remember like writing on people's
walls like hey what's up and like it's
someone left their computer open you
would hack their computer it's stuff
like that definitely help Facebook was
Saturday I was used for like instead of
texting I would facebook chat my friends
logging onto Facebook Stasi at gmail.com
that's me
hey girlie what up you want to come over
poke this poke war is on didn't have you
just poked me oh all right how does she
poked me that fast
she left her face was on on my laptop
she's so mad it kind of died in high
school and they came back when I went to
college but it is basically used for
uploading pictures like the ones that
you don't upload to Instagram you upload
to Facebook that's what I did at least
just like updating people about your
life through pictures I guess and
occasionally making the status update of
something that happened in your life
like I just posted a status update
saying about my internship but look I
would never post a status update like
hey going to the mall my back in the day
I did so today and snapchat in so that
like snapchat first started I believe I
was a sophomore in high school and
and I remember my friend Cindy it was
just full of ugly faces and they go away
in ten seconds so it's funny so that's
all I use snapchat for it was just like
we kind of had a conversation through it
but it was just like me making a bunch
of dodges and like ugly faces and like
if you were stop trying a cute boy you
kind of tried making like a goofy face
but like still look cute so I found this
app it's where you just take pictures of
yourself and you make up the ugliest
faces and then it goes away in like ten
seconds so it doesn't even matter how
ugly your face is all right okay
today it's heightened to another level
we have the dog filter we have all the
other builders we have some that make
you look really bad and some that like
girls are like Oh Mike looks so bad but
so ya know it like all those filters you
swipe them you see which one makes the
best like all the geotags like it's it's
just great I love snapchat now so yeah
that's like what's not guys to come now
I am definitely a perfect
me of all the guys on my contact so I
decided to leave out Twitter because
honestly I'm not the best at Twitter
maybe like it hasn't changed that much
like you just make tweets I don't know
so do sex leave that one out but that is
the rest of my video I hope that you
guys like its give it a thumbs up if you
did or if you can relate to any of these
and if I missed anything put it down
below because I'm always down for a good
reminiscing time of our middle school
early high school days
yes feel me I love like thinking about
what's up and so you guys want any more
of these like then force now videos

don't really get better at them if you
guys want me to do them but yeah so hope
