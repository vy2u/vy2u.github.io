break hall which is really exciting
because I bought a ton of things over
spring break like I bought lie didn't
seem like that much during spring break
but now looking at the bag I bought a
lot so I'm went to Florida and then i
went to new york for spring break so i
was really really busy so i'm just going
to get started into what i bought and
i'll just tell you the stores that I got
them from because it obviously wasn't
just one store the first place i'll do
is H&amp;amp;M and it is a maxi dress and I Bo
it actually I think I bought like three
maxi dresses this spring break this is
just a plain white one nothing special
about it I just thought it was really
cute um let's just plain black and did I
say white and beginning maybe it's plain
black and I love it because I'm obsessed
with maxi dresses so yeah the next thing
I got is also a maxi dress and it's from
H&amp;amp;M as well um and it's kind of like
kind of cheetah print I guess um I'm
trying to I'm tell of it this is what it
looks like it has this little
stretchiness on the front but then it
goes into a cheetah print and it's a
maxi dress and I'm obsessed with maxi
dresses um next thing that I got was
this Mickey Mouse tank top I thought it
was really cute um this is what it looks
like it has fringe on the bottom and I
thought late to be so key to wear this
to like a summer concert with some
high-waisted shorts because it's kind of
like a shorter shirt you guys can tell
but I thought it was adorable and it was
pretty cheap so had to have it hmm is a
really great place to find fancy dresses
because they are fairly cheap they're
about thirty to forty dollars or thirty
to fifty dollars i'd say this was 40 and
they are so cute and they look like
they're designer and they're so
expensive but they're really not um so i
love this black dress but it's like
see-through but I has a little it has
like um it's not see-through like
completely it's cedar and then I have
something under it um and then it's just
like that throughout and it's a shorter
dress and it just has like all of these
like just like some black lines on it I
don't know I really really like it
and it was forty dollars and you never
know when you need it fancy just to go
to a party or something and my birthday
just passed and I don't even know what
I'm doing we're obviously not a big
party but I might go to dinner or
something I don't really know next where
I went to as free people and oh my
goodness guys I am obsessed with the bag
that they put it in and I went to free
people at the actual store not like in
Bloomingdale's or Nordstrom or anything
like that but this is the shopping bag
like how cute is this I think I'm gonna
wear this is like an actual person
summer because of you I thought one
thing from their because they are
inexpensive it's short and this is kind
of like my birthday present because i
was in new york during my day before my
birthday um and it's also kind of like a
maxi dress but it's a maxi jumper is the
cutest thing if you go on my instagram i
post a picture of myself wearing it so
it's a tan le Barbu if you want to check
that out um but this is what it looks
like the front it has this really cool
like yellow couldn't crochet pattern and
it's like spaghetti strap and then like
you're not gonna be able to see the real
beauty of it on camera but and then it
like goes out into this like lacy
crochet and at the legs of it cuz it's a
jumper at the legs it has this detail on
it and then it's just see through at the
very bottom you guys can see like you
guys can't you can't see the full beauty
of it go on my Instagram if you want to
see me myself actually wearing it it
looks really cute on there and I'm
obsessed with this this is my favorite
thing I got the next time I too was in
Florida and it is Gilly Hicks I'm not
sure if you guys know it this is the bag
its kind of all wrinkled up right now
but Gilly Hicks and it's the same line
as abercrombie and hollister but they
don't have it all over the country they
have it and like I think they only have
like 13 or 15 locations and they had I
in Florida so I just got a bathing suit
from there and it was on sale and I look
how cute it is it's triangular um
triangular and it has some like crochet
at the bottom I thought it was really
cute then the bottoms are just plain
coral bottoms and it's coral right here
it's coral I
sure the pic camera is picking up
picking it up as pink but it's like an
orange grove the next door i went to is
called apricot petite and the bags all
wrinkled but this is what the back looks
like and um I think they have this in
multiple places i have it in florida but
i'm not sure i actually help us at West
Palm Beach you guys live there visit
there in a place called city place or
city plaza i think it was called the
most beautiful flowers ever but we
stopped on the way back home from from
florida to meth carolina we just stopped
at that low plaza cuz my dad had to go
somewhere but anyways i stopped with
this store and I got one dress there and
I thought I was so cute um it was on
sale like I think it was forty percent
off or sixty percent off I don't know
something like that um you guys it's not
button so you can't really tell but it's
kind of like a shirt dress it's a little
bit like older and more mature I think
but I think it'd be so cute to wear
during the summertime some like aviators
on I always is it just me or whenever
I'm buying something for the summer I
always picture myself wearing it like
with all my accessories and just like
being really tan everything I don't know
I don't know that's just me but I always
figure myself wearing like the clothes
the next door I went to was forever 21
of course and I stopped by there I think
to time for something um so this is kind
of like two days worth of shopping so
the first thing that I got and this was
also one of my outfit my easter outfit
of the day if you guys follow me on
instagram or twitter you would have seen
this one and some of you guys asking
we're asking me where I got it so
forever 21 and it is just a really
pretty um very like really cute and like
girly dress and it has ruffles at the
bottom and it has this really cute um
floral design on it and that's just a
really sweet dress and this is what
looks like him far away and I just
really love this dress especially for
like Easter I thought was cute the next
thing I got um was this tank top and it
was just a plain tank top with blue and
green stripes and it has Razorback is
that way you call it I don't know next
thing I got was this polka dotted shirt
and I love polka dots
and this it was just a plain polka dot
shirt but on the sleeves it kind of do
you see like your arm goes through and
then I don't know if you guys can tell
it's kind of like up off the shoulder
but not really hard to explain the next
thing I got with another maxi dress I
told you guys I was obsessed with maxi
dresses it's a plain purple one and
again the sleeves are like the same as
that polka dotted shirt how its kind of
off the shoulder um that's just a v-neck
purple and long and it was like fifteen
dollars goes really cheap thing i got
was another dress from forever 21 and it
was a very cute and girly dress a
reminds me of taylor swift um this is
what it looks like I just thought it was
really cute and it doesn't have any
shape to it but it has this little belt
it's just the same color as the dress
can't find it it's a little bout so he
could tie it around to kind of give
yourself some shape and the pattern i
just thought was a really pretty pattern
and it was just really cute and girly
and I thought it was really perfect for
the summer in the springtime the next
shirt I got was a crop top kind of um
it's just a tan color and at the bottom
it has this like hold crochet and then
the next thing I got forever 21 was this
shirt um I thought was so cute it's a
crop top again um and it says permanent
vacation I don't know I just thought was
a really cute shirt I didn't really care
what it says on it but I'm excited to
wear this with high-waisted shorts I
gotta get myself some high-waisted
shorts because i'm planning on wearing
all of these outfits with high-waisted
shorts and i have some but they're not
really high waisted so I gotta go to
urban outfitters to get me some
high-waisted shorts but they're so
expensive at Urban Outfitters does
anyone know of any good places that
sells high waisted shorts that are not
expensive and don't say American Eagle
cuz they don't sell them there this year
and then of course I got some jewelry at
forever 21 and I got let's see I got
these really pretty earrings I thought
these were really cute and they met your
nail polish and then these i got these
earrings too and these are we really
like edgier
unlike anything I have and they just
have like all right now to explain it
but you guys can see it and see for
yourself and then i got these earrings
and i thought these are so cute cuz
there's stars but then they have that
little pearl in the middle of it I
thought that was really cute next I went
to was urban outfitters and I am
obsessed with urban outfitters I just
hate how expensive they are but um the
first thing I got oh my gosh this and
the Free People jumper arm definitely my
favorite things I got this whole spring
break and they look very similar to each
other like the same style um this dress
is from urban outfitters and it just has
this beautiful neckline with that
beautiful detail and it's just lay soul
over and the arms kind of like go out so
they're kind of like 70s like hippie-ish
and then the back you guys look at this
beauty it's unopened back just a
backless dress pretty much and I thought
it was so cute and at the top it has
this little button and it's just so
pretty and I am obsessed with this dress
and it's on sale now guys so in case you
guys want to go buy it it's from 72 I
think like 50 or something next thing I
got was this banjo and I am obsessed
with banjos because I feel like I need
to wear them everything if the shirts
two loci or see-through and I thought
this is a perfect one cuz it's neutral
but it also has lace so it's still
really pretty and yeah and then I got
some shoes from urban outfitters and
these shoes are so cute and they kind of
match my nail polish too um they're just
these like see mint green with some
studs on them and their flip flops and I
just really like them the next shoes I
got were these um sandals and I thought
these were really different and unlike
anything I have and like just looking at
them like this they don't really look
that cute butt on your feet they
actually look really cute so don't judge
just from this because on the feet they
look cute and I like it cuz they're tan
like neutral color in their beige so I
don't have any shoes like that like all
my flip-flops are colorful and it's nice
to have
so good like neutral pair of sandals
last thing i got at Urban Outfitters was
this shirt and I love it it's this like
crochet kind of media i get everything
crochet lace I'm obsessed with crochet
and lace but it's just like crochet kind
of detailed shirt and I it's kind of a
crop yeah it's a crop top again I'm
obsessed with crop tops and the arm is
just like a quarter sleeve but I'm not
gonna be hot with it because it's like
open it has a lot of holes in it so and
it's really thin and nice and the color
is you guys can tell but it's kind of a
green grey I don't know if you guys can
tell but it's a green grey and it's
really cute last but not least I'm sorry

charlie and I don't they're located all
over but not that many places all over

thing i got was this really cute um I
don't even know what it's called really
I wore it over a tank top but it's just
this like thing I don't know you guys
can judge for yourself what it is I've
war over a tank top with some jeans next
thing I got was kind of like a maxi

excited to try it out and it looks like
this end guys this is my favorite part
at the waist it has this little clear
thing and in the front it's high and in
the back it's long so I just thought
this was really cute and I love purple

really good on everybody thing i got was
this purse that I thought would be a
really cute summer purse as you guys
could tell I'm really excited for summer
and kind of going crazy with the
shopping um it's this kind of like knit
like it reminds me of something I hadn't

nick knapsack bag not knapsack

strap and it's purple again but it's
purple and a bunch of different other
colors and in the middle at the
waistband it has this really cute like
tie I thought it was really cute can't
wait to wear this like cowboy boots and
not high-waisted shorts out with
few pieces of jewelry there the first
thing that I got was this um necklace
and I thought was really cute because
it's just like weird you know I don't
know it's abstract kind of but it's just
like this type of thing and I'm really
bad at explaining clothes and then it
has orange and then it came with some
matching earrings then I got this
bracelet and it's kind of like a
friendship bracelet but a bit more chic
because it has some metal in it and I
thought that was really cute and I
