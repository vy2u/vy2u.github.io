today I am filming a haul for you guys
this is a spring break haul so this is
all the stuff that I wore in Miami when
I went for Easter break I don't my swing
rake was a really long time ago and my
birthday was actually this again so I
just turned 21 so for this haul I am
going to show you just a couple things I
got it's not a huge huge haul but all
the pieces that I got I absolutely loved
and I'm so excited to show it to you
guys if you guys are new here please be
sure to subscribe to my channel and give
this video a thumbs up I would
absolutely love that and without further
ado let's get started in the home so my
first favorite thing that I got is this
two piece set I will have everything
linked down below everything I got is
from Windsor though but I you guys know
I love to have half my closets Windsor
so I got this two piece set it really
reminds me of Coachella sadly I was not
at Coachella this year but I just
absolutely love it the shorts are super
flowy and cute and the shirt is a crop
top I love it so much it's so so
comfortable to the shorts feel like
you're wearing pajamas and same with the
shirt like this is definitely my
favorite two-piece that I own and it
really does remind me of Coachella so if
I was going that wouldn't Stephanie a
possibility of something I could've worn
I really tried to make everything that I
got Coachella inspired because I was so
sad that I wasn't there that I still
kind of wanted to act like I was by
wearing very like hippy pieces the next
thing that guys got is also a very like
Coachella ish dress and it is this long
maxi dress and if you guys want to see
any of the outfits how I styled them I
posted it almost all of these to my
Instagram so this one is so pretty it
has like the off the shoulder sleeve and
then it's really stretchy at the top and
then it flows into a maxi dress but I
have the slits on it so it's just
gorgeous I love the colors of it I feel
like this really really reminds me of
something somewhere tropical or
California or Florida anyway or like
with warm weather this reminds me of and
it's just so beautiful
the next thing that I got is this other
two-piece and I realized I didn't
realize like up to many four
- p-sets but now I'm like that way yes I
did so it is this to be set and it is
gorgeous I love this one if I can undo
it I'm like trying to mess with it let's
see you guys ever like not know how to
put on clothes yeah I have no idea what
I'm doing
seeks how is they dip got it
it is this halter top so it has like a
low V and it's a beige color with gold
lines through it I don't know if you can
tell that they're really really skinny
gold lines and then the back is a low
back so it's pretty much backless and
then the shorts are the exact same but
they're flowy
they're super super comfortable again
the same materials same design and they
have cute little ruffles on the bottom I
love this I can get it so cute and you
can definitely dress it up or dress it
down that can dress down with the done
jacket every good dress up I went with
heels or wedges I love that to be said
those colors are like everything I've
wear so it's perfect because I don't
know where like neutrals the next thing
that I got are these denim shorts
and if you guys don't know I have a
problem with denim shorts I wear them
every single day in the summer I'm not
kidding I have them on right now I read
everyday when it's passed like 75
degrees I just only wear denim shorts or
maybe of their occasional dress but like
I live in denim shorts so I got these
denim shorts and they're just plain
shorts but I really like them because
they kind of go high on the side and
then they go low-end in the back so your
butt doesn't hang out because I really
hate what I'm wearing shorts and I just
have to keep pulling them down cuz I got
it singing out not to you you know and
they're really really stretchy there
looks super stretchy and then the next
thing I thought I was so exciting
probably so if you wanted to get one of
these from Urban Outfitters but they are
so expensive like I just can't justify
spending that much on a brawl at Urban
Outfitters because I think they're like
$40 or something like that but I got
this really cute bralette and I like it
because they're the red like rose the
roses like cover the nipples you know so
they're really really really cute I am
test with this I've always wanted the
one from urban but I just never spent
the money on it and this is just
beautiful I think I love how it's a red
so that if you see it over underneath
like it gives it a pop of color
I just think oh so cute I don't know if
I could ever wear this with it just
showing but I like wearing it because as
you guys know I like matching my bras
and underwear so I like having cute bras
on even though if no one's gonna see it
I like having to leave your cute
underwear on you know I'm just like like
that because I feel better so that's
kind of like the same for this even if
no one sees it it's still really cute
and if someone says see it it's cute so
the next thing that I got is this dress
I'm actually going to be wearing to my
21st birthday party I'm having a new
kind of like a mini party party at my
apartment and then that's going downtown
and I am wearing this dress is gorgeous
I am obsessed it's a bodycon dress but
it's so when a de material so it feels
like pajamas again like I know I
describe that a lot but like it feels
like tight pajamas like they are it just
so freakin soft and stretchy I love the
crisscross at the very top and then it
just hugs your body and it has a long as
zipper on the back which I think gives
it a nice touch to it so I am obsessed I
love that it looks like a wrap dress
like it like has all the lines on it
that make it look like a cleaned after
ground I love it and on the side to wear
it and I also love that teal color I
think it's so pretty and then the next
thing that I got from Windsor is this
halter romper and I actually wore this
on my birthday to my Easter brunch and
because my birthday was on Easter by the
way so I was like turning up fruit Jesus
I wear this halter there and it is kind
of a dark salmon color I guess I would
call it I don't know if that makes any
sense any of you like a pinkish purple
like right before it turns purple oh and
they have large iron ruffle so it's like
this one giant thing that kind of looks
like a tank top but it's not and then it
goes down into a romper which I think
it's so you and it just ties at the top
and then it
has an open back so I really really
loved it I thought it was the perfect
Easter outfits and yeah I loved it and
last but not least this is my mighty
favorite thing that I got I bought this
for my parents so thank you thank you
thank you for I showed what I got I want
to make it known that I know that not a
lot of people can afford this I know
that a lot of people will get this in
their lifetime I know that I'm not
trying to brag either I am just showing
you guys oh my god cuz you guys will
love seeing holes and that's what I got
for Christmas whatever birthday you guys

Chloe bag

wanted to designer bag for a while but I
just like can't really afford one myself
and so I just really wanted one more my
own so I'm gonna save up for I'm gonna

this bag I am so obsessed with it me and
my mom picked it out and I cannot be
happier it's suede leather and it's blue
and it's not this like a little dark
fish blue material has this they're like
box kind of like that has pockets I just
love it so much I think it's beautiful

has like a short blue strap so you can

purse both of the straps are detachable
