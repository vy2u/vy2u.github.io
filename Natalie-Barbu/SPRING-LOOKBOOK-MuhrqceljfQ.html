spring lookbook video and I am so
excited to film this because this video
actually like went around town and I
like did like films like in different
places not just my backyard one of them
was actually in my backyard but like the
rest of them are in different places
guys that this is exciting for me and I
also filmed some like behind the scenes
thing because I wanted you guys see like
footage of like behind the scenes so I
don't know if I'm gonna put it in this
video or in another video like make a
separate video for specifically like
behind the scenes stuff not quite sure
yet but um yeah I probably you guys
obviously you know when you watch the
video if it's in this video or bye or
after I'll see you and I like edited see
how long it is and stuff cuz I don't
want to be too long but yeah so this is
like my favorite look this is like my
favorite video to film and I have a ton
of really cute outfits and I really
enjoyed filming it and I had so much fun
and I just want to make this video under
like my best edited videos like I don't
have homework tonight actually I do but
I'm not gonna do it until later and so
like I really want to like spend time
editing this video and guys the weather
outside is the best weather when the
weather outside is the best weather ever
and I was like outside all day I
probably like smelling bad so I was
outside all day but um it's like so nice
and it's like 70 degrees and sunny and
it was like pouring rain this morning
which is like there's always a sunny day
after the rain or even if it's then the
same day it doesn't need to be another
day but um yeah so I am so excited for
you guys to see this video cuz I was
very happy making it I even picked up my
little sister from school early just so
that she could beat my little filmer
yeah that's how important this video is
for me my sister was missing quality
education for this video you guys so
yeah if you guys don't know I am doing a
giveaway and it is a spring giveaway
that's like a ton of stuff that I'm
doing like I'm giving away a ton of
stuff so you don't forget to enter a nut
and I will talk to you guys later and if
you guys like tell me which outfit is
your favorite and if
like mimicking outfit Instagram me or
tweet me a pic of your outfit so that I
can see like or just like um if you tag
me on Instagram which is at Natalie
underscore Barbu if you tag me on a
scram a picture of your favorite spring
look I'm going to like it and I just
love like seeing all the inspirations
stuff and I just like getting
inspiration from regular people because
they feel like some wonderful more
realistic than getting inspiration from
like celebrities which is awesome too
but they also choose so many like high
prices of products and stuff so I'd
rather get situation from my viewers and
yeah so just um tag me on Twitter Atari
on Instagram and I will favor it or like
your pic and yeah you talk to you later
bye
this first outfit is a very edgy outfit
and by the way all the titles to my
thing are nice to read like this is
spring hedge I really couldn't think
about anything creative but it is just
some really crazy pants with a black
button-down top that has some studs on
the collar which is really cute the top
is from Urban Outfitters the pants are
drum I believe New York and company but
I'm not completely sure so they just
have some a bunch of gold like I don't
even know how to describe it like
splotches of gold on it and my collar
shirt is from Urban Outfitters and
stuffs all over it and my earrings are
some love traffic-light
earrings I think are so cute my second
alpha is a lacy spring at outfit and it
is a lace dress with a really cute denim
jacket and some hot pink shoes and by
the way I forgot to take off my jewelry
so the jewelry is the same from last
outfit but the dress is just a spaghetti
strap dress which is really really cute
and it kind of looks like a nightgown
but it's from Nordstrom BP my denim
jacket is from American Eagle and I has
that really cute like tribal print on
the back which I thought was really cute
and my shoes are from the gap and they
are just the cutest little things they
kind of mimic like Oh Oxford's but they
also kind of look like cute bowling
shoes I don't know but I really like
them they add a pop of color to anything
and I just thought this was so nice and
bright for the spring and it's really
refreshing I will definitely keep you
cool and yeah that's why I love this
outfit
this next outfit is army spring I don't
know I was just wearing like a army
jacket type thing so that's why I called
it that it is the army like no I I'm
drawing a blanket but these jackets are
called utility jacket
it's from the Kendall + Kylie collection
at PacSun and then I'm wearing the super
cute dress it looks like a skirt and a
top but it's actually a dress and it's
from American Eagle and I'm pairing it
with some cute little fringe booties
this is probably my favorite outfit out
of all of the outfits just because it's
so cute and I just love the pot like the
utility jacket with a really sweet dress
because it just gives it a little bit of
an edge but it's still super cute and
it's perfect for a spring and you can of
course cut the sleeves with the jacket
for the springtime to keep cool
obviously and yeah so I really love that
outfit and this next outfit I called the
hipster spring outfit not because it's
really like hipster just cuz I was
wearing some like nerd glasses and
that's like apparently really hipster am
i right I think so so yeah the glasses
are from American Eagle and I love those
those are non prescription glasses so I
could wear them I have excellent vision
you guys and I just thought those
glasses were so cute and this top is
from American Eagle and the shorts are
from American Eagle yep everything's
from American Eagle I work there in case
you didn't know that but the top is a
really mint colored green and that's
probably my favorite colored shirt own
oh hey there's me taking some selfies
don't I look like so cute or what yeah
totally just kidding let's take a look
at them oh yeah so hot you guys oh my
gosh it really looks like I'm gonna jog
