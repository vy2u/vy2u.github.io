to leave pretty soon you know see
youtube probs so I hope you guys enjoyed
today's video because I am coming to you
with a summer essentials video and this
video I just didn't want it to make it
kind of like my favorite type of outfit
not obviously my favorite alpha so just
like the things I like to wear just
favorite things that I like in summer
things I remind me of summer just summer
things you know so yeah that's basically
this video is also i hit almost by the
time you're watching this i might have
hit twenty-one thousand subscribers
which is crazy i said this in every
single video but she cuz i love you guys
so much so make sure that you are
subscribed two weeks of Giveaways coming
up so yeah just hit that subscribe
button if you're new to my channel
welcome thanks for joining us feel like
I'm like a family like meetings like my
daughter's boyfriend or something and
I'm like 19 years old right now I don't
really know what I'm saying anyways so I
just hope that you enjoyed this video
and give this video a huge thumbs up if
you were excited for summer and let's
try to get this video to be the most
sums of studio of all time of my videos
and I don't know how much that is but
just like what stuff to do up and then
all you guys know who did it so yeah
that's a pretty good plan you know but
anyways let's just just get into this
video so my favorite face washes summer
is actually just any scrub i'm really
loving the st. Ives one just because I
love being smooth in the summer and then
my favorite moisturizer is just any with
SPF because of summer you know so my
favorite clothing items one of them is
colorful ralpherz i really love this one
because it's backless in pattern and
just super colorful it is from
sheinside.com i will post it down below
or just click on the link if you want to
shop this look you know but yeah i just
really really really love colorful
rompers I just think that they're so
summery and what's better than having an
outlet all with one piece of clothing
that's what I just really love not
having to really look for a bunch of
things
this next alpha is also from sheinside
and I absolutely love this outfit I've
been obsessed with matching crop tops
and bottoms whether that's skirt or
shorts I love this one just cuz it's so
effortless it's white with navy blue and
I feel like this like Navy royal blue
kind of reminds me of Greece it's like
the White House's and the blue roofs but
yeah I just really love the matching top
and bottom and crop tops are just so in
for summer but yeah i'm basically
obsessed with this outfit just because
i've always wanted one and when i saw it
i just had to get it on their website so
yeah i'll leave all the links down below
even though i do tan outside in the
summer i do try to put on SPF and then I
tan myself with this st. Tropez face and
a body one it's the most natural tan
ever and i highly recommend it and for
my hair I don't like putting heat in my
hair in the summer so all I do is spray
the sea salt spray in my hair and this
new one by mumble mumble actually has
oil in it so it doesn't leave that
crunchy or hard which I love
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
let me know what you think give this
video a big thumbs up if you guys
