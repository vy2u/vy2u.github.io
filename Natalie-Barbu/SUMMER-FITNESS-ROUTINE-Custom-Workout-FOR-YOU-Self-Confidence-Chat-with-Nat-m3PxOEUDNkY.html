a fitness video today I actually filmed
this video yesterday and I dyed my hair
today so it's kind of blonde and I'm
like in love with this it's not blonde
like a blonde person but it's like
blonde light brown blonde anyway that's
besides the point I have gotten this
video requests so so so many times and
I'm so excited to film it for you guys
and it'll switch this camera angle a
little bit anyways so yeah I'm only a
fitness routine for you guys and I am
NOT certified I'm not trained
I am literally just a normal probably
below average sitting person men most
people and I am not scared to minute or
anything like I really don't like
working out and I kind of get mad when
people are like I love working out it
looks I just I can't like I can't skip
it it's just I need to work out at all
time yes I understand you'd feel better
after you work out but the mental
preparedness that you need to be in to
work out is so high for me you guys I
don't know if it's like that for you but
it's tough for me to actually work out
but anyways I found this app recently
and I have been trying so many new
things to kind of help me workouts I've
been in a funk lately I used to do
Blogilates and then I did that just so
long that I kind of just wanted
something new still love Barbie lotty's
but I just wanted something new and so
I've been looking kind of on the
internet for things I'd wanted the gyms
excuse me I'm gonna jam I've been
getting just different things like
trying to help me get into shape and
nothing realize I've been into a book
bottom line and then I found this app
it's called pump up act one of my
friends have it and I also just saw it
on through the app store you know it
takes a safe my new favorite fitness app
so all the other ones that I tried all
cost money like there's there's like a
free workout for each app and then it's
like
to get more workouts it's $7.99 a month
it's like oh I don't want to pay that
much so this one is totally free and
it's seriously like the best thing since
like forever like it's so awesome I
don't even know how it's free and like
don't raise the price because it's
awesome I like for you anyways the app
is called pump up app and I don't know
if you guys have it if you do follow me
on it cuz it's kind of like a social
media for fitness stuff the great thing
about this app is that you totally get
to choose what you want to do so I'll
show you guys in the video this app can
give you an hour and a half of workouts
that scares me how some people can
actually work out for 90 minutes and not
die at just saying that rose give me
okay so you create your own workout and
you can actually track your weight log
your activity take a photo which I
actually did so follow me if you guys
wanna see that and start workout I'm not
gonna start one right now but that's the
one I just did yesterday and it took me
twenty six minutes but I said I only
want to do 20 minutes cuz I was so unfit
that I get like kept taking breaks
that's what's so great about it face
it's so customizable to you so I thought
that that was awesome about it and you
choose the muscles you want to target so
I'll just show you guys so I did get
toned but you can do build muscle be
healthy or lose weight and if you hit
let's say lose weight I said
intermediate but I think I'm about
intermediate to beginner but you know I
said intermediate and you can do from oh
let's not get crazy
15 minutes how way to make me feel good
it's like it's nothing on the bar and
ninety minutes so let's say I wanted to
do ninety minutes you can select your
location so let's say that you're away
you can totally decide what you want to
bring so let's say you have a band with
you let's say I have a curl bar with me
alright I have those what muscles do I
want to target okay let's say I just
want to do a full body workout because
you know feeling
strong and then if you want to be a core
circuit which is like absent gourd core
circuit or conditioning just to feel
amazing so let's say you want to do both
you select both of them okay and then it
builds your custom work out for you I
think that is like the coolest thing in
the whole wide world and if you go I
don't even know why not but yeah I know
those so cool and then your workout
starts and I will show you guys in the
video so obviously the first thing I do
when I workout is actually get my
workout clothes so I just go through my
drawer and get any random clothes that I
see so today I decided for some Nike
leggings and a Nike sports bra so then I
just lay out a mat on my floor I
actually could not find my mat so I laid
out a towel yeah I know that's gonna
ratchet but you know what oh wow
then my doughnuts are kind of just
shouldn't matter your dogs never do that
anyways then I get my pump up app
started so I just go to my pump up app
and click start workout once I start my
workout it's gonna ask me a bunch of
questions so I decided that I wanted to
get tone about intermediate level and
you know you wouldn't do an hour and a
half of exercise hey ya know yeah 20
minutes and said okay now since I'm at
my house I'm gonna do the home one and I
don't have any equipment so I'm just
gonna do no equipment and I kind of
wanted to work on my abs and my glutes
and my arm so those are the muscles that
I decided to target in this video and
those are mainly that muscles I try to
target every time because those are my
main focal points and then I'm just
deciding that I want to do circuit and
core training just a little bit of both
to mix it up I'm gonna ask you for your
height and weight and then it's going to
build your workout when this building
your workout what I recommend is
actually taking some water and just
and kind of getting you ready for your
workout so just making sure you stay
hydrated because that is so so important
you guys now we're getting started into
the workout so what I did in the
beginning with these butt kicks that it
told me to do and then it just went
right into the conditioning now going to
show you all of them but I did push up
planks and then I did these leg things
jumping jacks and squats jumping squats
then you take a break and what I like to
do with my breaks is basically die and
drink water basically you know then it's
going to tell you to repeat this three
times I'm not gonna show you but you get
the idea and then after you repeat the
circuit training three times it's gonna
go into your explore circuit so this is
definitely gonna target your abs and I
like to do some crisscross sit-ups and a
plank of course mountain climbers and
this weird thing that I didn't know it's
called the Frog set up after you repeat
that three times I love it stretching
this is by far my favorite part and I
just do the stretches that it recommends
me on pop ups I was dying after that
workout but pump up actually loves my
workout and people could like it and
comment so it's definitely a really cool
way to encourage each other so I hope
you guys enjoyed that video today and
let me know what you guys think and what
your fitness routine is and I actually
kind of want to talk to you guys about
sub confidence because I feel like a lot
of us are kind of put down and we put
ourselves down and that's so not okay
I am definitely one to put myself down
sometimes and I'm not saying that I'm
not because I think all girls are and
just all boys are to everyone I'm just
system sums down all the time and I
think once we realize that we are
beautiful and we are strong and we are
awesome and amazing especially as girls
I think a lot of us compare ourselves to
other girls and I totally guilty of that
whether that's comparing yourself to
your best friend comparing yourself to
your sister or comparing yourself to a
supermodel it still seems
oh I'll taste it I'm 5/3 not six-foot
and I don't have curbs yet my waist is
this tiny like that's that day are
beautiful and I'm not putting them down
at all but we need to realize that we
are all so different and no one bodies
are the same and we just kind of work as
hard as we can to achieve that but we
might not ever get it just because
that's not how we are made and that is
okay like we can if you want to lose
weight I don't think there's anything
wrong with that lose weight go for it
obviously in a healthy way and if you
want to get toned go for it if you want
to gain weight go for it so be healthy I
have a lot to say about self-confidence
so if you want me to make a separate
video on that let me know but also with
this app I think it's great that it logs
everything and it tracks everything
because not only are you doing this on
your own you're doing it with other
people so they have a community on it
and I think it's so cool and it's just a
bunch of people empowering you right
after I did my workout two people liked
it that I don't even know and I was like
thank you like that makes me feel great
that's limp like hey you go you're
awesome
keep working out and working on to
achieve your goal and I think that's so
awesome how there's a community like
that and I feel so self-conscious like
I'm a self-conscious Twista bikini
picture on Instagram because my friends
and people from school are gonna see it
it'd be like have their own comments but
like in this community it's not people I
know it's not people that are gonna
judge you it's people that are in it
together with you so that that's what I
think is so awesome about this app too
is that just a community of people that
aren't there for you and yeah that's
just my five cents of self confidence
and the importance of a community so if
anything just have a communion
first sometimes when you eat after you
and not judging you because I think we
judge ourselves in that as it is and we
are our biggest critics no matter what
anyone says in that is so unhealthy and
it's been so hard for me to get to the
level of confidence that I'm okay with
how I am
Oh Keith how I look I'm okay with
whatever because yeah I do want to get
toned but it's that's for me it's not
for anyone else it's for me it's not
because I think I'm ugly it's not
because I think that if I don't get
toned then I'm less of a person it's
just personal like I'm gonna get toned
because I want to be the healthiest I
can be up up app it's definitely my new
favorite app and follow me so we can
encourage each other because that'd be
so cool I will link everything down
below if you want but yeah you guys are
all beautiful and do you not ever hope
you enjoyed this video and you know make
sure to follow me on a trip
I'll wheelchair going on you know pop-up
