huge haul for you guys and this is just
because i am in florida right now and
you guys know that when either flowed
out i go kind of crazy with the shopping
just cuz the mall here is really big and
so I just kind of want to show you is
when I bought and I'm just going to get
right started in tonight so this doesn't
become a super long video and yesterday
is kind of a no makeup day and nothing
really with my hair day so do judgment
guys no judgment first I'm going to show
you guys is urban outfitters and I just
got a couple things from urban because
it's like my favorite store as you guys
may know I got these shoes they are the
brand ecote Cody I don't really know has
an accent mark over the last e these are
what they look like I just think these
are some really cute sandals and they
were on sale they were ten dollars off
so I think they were 24 instead of 34 um
but yeah then you're super cute i really
like them because they were a neutral
color and i kind of had gold studs all
along side here the only complaint I
have is that they're not very
comfortable to wear the straps are kind
of tight up here and it's kind of
confusing putting them on so that's my
only complaint but otherwise they are
really cute and they are a pretty good
price for issue next thing I want were
some other shoes from that same brand
because they were having ten dollars off
all of this brand of shoes so I got
these for I think only like ten dollars
so these are just some classic black
flip flops black sandals and I really
really liked them and okay wow this s
its size 7 but as I'm showing you guys
the back of the shoe says it's a size 8
hopefully they still put me but yeah so
these are Cody and they are just black
sandals next thing I got this headband
and I like really really like these like
vin 2g style headbands and it's kind of
like an American flag one except it's
just has the stars on it so not really
just has these stars on it and has kind
of like an acid-wash background I know I
kind of like
I'm just kind of like hippie style like
not like this it's way too thick but I
don't know just kind of like at the top
of your head like that you style your
hair correctly I don't know it's good if
you have like a bad hair day anything
like that just kind of want to throw
this on or you just where it's like a
regular headband like normal people do
but whatever so yes and you can always
put this in the front if you want to do
like the bow let's try this out yeah
like anything goes it's a headband have
fun with it there's no one rule to wear
like how to wear headbands and I then I
got this necklace and I got I'm really
into these like really a dainty
necklaces like the super thin ones that
it's just kind of like okay like you
don't really know what's on it I'm just
looks like a gold chain but you look
closely at this detail and if this one
says I heart you has an eye and that has
a heart and then it has you like that so
I hard you so I don't know I just really
really like this I thought it was really
cute and just I don't have many
necklaces so kind of want to get this
and then the next door is forever 21 of
course I cannot go to Florida and not
buy something from forever 21 so I'm
going to start the clothing items that i
bought I bought this shirt it's like a
diamond shirt it just has that like big
huge diamond and it's kind of like a
muscle tank or it is a muscle tank next
I bought a crop top and this reminded me
of taylor swift because it is the red
and blue stripes and it should remind me
of like you know America but now reminds
me taylor swift so red and blue stripes
just cuz i feel like she always wears
clothes like this but it's a crop top so
this would be cute to wear with some
high-waisted things the next thing I got
are these really cute shorts there's
some high-waisted shorts that are not
buttoned but the buttons come like all
the way up to here there's three more
buttons at the top but when i was trying
them on i'm behind it and it's this
really really pretty pale pink color and
it's just kind of like a denim material
and i just think
really classy short and I like him a lot
and now I got some jewelry from forever
21 I got these this cross earrings and I
really really liked these just because I
do like crosses but because normal
earrings like this that are like long or
dangle earring so it's kind of like
there's a little chain than dangles by
like this one is it's just kind of stuck
to your ear but it's long like I don't
know how to describe it but they're not
like dangling earrings if you guys see
what I'm saying next I got this ring and
I thought these were so cute they were a
pair too but they have like the little
nerd hipster glasses on them ones and
golden ones and silver and I just
thought that these are just really
really cute ready so you can wear with
kind of any outfit to kind of make it a
little bit more fun and I got this next
necklace and it's kind of it right
advanced you like a guy necklace like
necklaces that guys where it has this
like woven Brown chain not really chain
with necklace and then it has this
circle thing like metal and it has a
cross on one side and then it has faith
on the other side I thought that was
really cute and it's been like your
Christian faith I guess it's real
important to me so that was really cool
to how I had it and it was a chica show
this next um ring is like my all-time
favorite ring it is this kitty cat ring
and I just thought it was so cute like
I'm just gonna wear this with everything
so it is so adorable you guys like 40
times and such cheap jewelry so it's
like really good if you're on a budget
and you just don't want to get some cute
like working things and then i got these
rings that i thought were really cool
because there's square so they're these
square rings and i'm now they're just
these square rings that i'm going to
wear with a bunch of different outfits
because they come in all metal tone
is for us they go bad for a first things
first this is the best body butter ever
it is joe or josie maran it is her body
butter and i can't describe how much i
love this body butter it smells amazing
it literally keeps moisture eyes forever
it is kind of pricey i think it was like
thirty dollars or something like that
maybe but it is pretty big too it's
gonna last me a long time but it's like
a whipped body butter that just smells
so good and keeps you moisturize and i
literally if i could i would eat this
because it smells that delicious and i
just want to put this on all day every
day and I do put it on all day every day
actually I bought yesterday but I think
on this morning so we're off to a good
start but yeah is the bomb com okay so
next thing from sephora i got a
cleansing conditioner it is wen by Chaz
Dean in the scent fig I believe this is
what it looks like this is actually my
mom's but I use it quite often I really
like this because it makes your hair
super super soft and it pretty much like
healed your hair like if your hair's dry
damaged and grows kind of like mine then
it will like mend it back to life and
like bring it back to like softness and
shininess and it is a cleansing
conditioner so it's not a shampoo but
it's not like only conditioner so you
just work it whew i keep dropping
everything going to be tried i'm going
to try to use this a lot more often just
because of all the benefits it does for
your hair and it really does work and
like my mom swears by this product like
she loves it she's even you stand on my
dog just kind of weird she's just about
my dog once and she's like his hair was
up like mom is it all
whatever next thing I got it's very very
exciting and I don't know where the
other one is but I have the Rita Hazan
pop color temporary color hair spray in
blue and pink and I also got a purple
but I'm not quite sure where it is it's
missing so yeah I got all these colors
and you guys eat test totally works like
I have brown hair but i have like
lighter root or lighter colors at the
bottom but i just kind of sprayed this
like ombre style all in the bottom right
hair and it made me look like a mermaid
i post a picture on Instagram so we
follow me on instagram at Natalie
underscore Barbu please check out that
picture and like it's oozes the Bombers
looks like I got it done at em at hair
salon and I honestly just used up the
samples at sephora like this was before
I even bought it like I him don't eat
these yet I was that sworn i saw the
sample was like kind of spraining my
hair and I was like you know I'm just
give myself a makeover so I like sprayed
across like all the ends of my hair and
it looks like well and so I'm excited to
use this just kind of if you want
colorful hair for a day you use this and
I totally recommend these to every
single person in the world next door is
joram and supports MVP wishes by love my
favorite store actually urban and we're
shum probably on I got this skirt it is
just a gray flowy skirts kinda like gray
acid wash it looks and then I got a just
classic tank top very very flowy tank
top that will not keep you hot at all
it's like the thinnest material ever and
it's just this white flowy tank top with
this razor back detail on the back and I
got a plane striped shirt and I liked it
because it was it's not a crop top I
mean it's like just perfect normal
length shirt and it's just black and
white stripes and it fits you perfectly
it's like really
tight on you and I don't really have any
tight shirts like that so that's it it's
like super soft so that's why I decided
to grab this and feel like I can wear
this with pretty much anything that
matches black and white colors the next
door I got wise Lulu melon this is the
very first time and I'm buying anything
from that sort and I really like it it's
just extremely pricey and kind of
ridiculously priced all I got was one
thing from them and it was kind of a
splurge for me but they were just the
cutest running shorts ever and like I
don't really work out but because of
these running shorts i'm going to start
trying to work out and I'm going on a
cruise tomorrow and they had a gym
overlooking the ocean and so I feel like
that's gonna kind of also motivate me so
since I'm gonna be eating like like
eating like crazy because you know
cruises are like included the food is
included in the price so you can go to a
gourmet dinner and get like five steaks
and they won't be perfectly okay with it
so yeah that's probably gonna be me I'm
gonna be the one ordering like one item
off of like one on like every single
entree just kind of test it out and
they'll end up eating all of them and
then I'll gained like 20 pounds and yeah
so that's going to be me so I'm going to
be trying to motivate it to work out um
but these are the shorts i got and they
are the cutest running shorts in the
world they are the best like Khloe's
material like I feel like I meant it's
going to like I'm gonna think I'm
wearing underwear when I'm going to work
out because of how thin this material is
and how like Airy it is but the pattern
was just too cute to resist it's like a
mint green band at the top and it has a
pocket in the back for like your ipod
and whatnot and then it has like really
really light blue and mint green flowers
and like that's type of design on it and
so I in love with these shorts and the
lube annulling bag that you shop in it's
just like super cute and so i just
bought something just like to get the
bag just kidding but it's definitely a
great perk next to where I went into
million you will not know what it is
because i didn't even know what
before going into it but it is Mason no
it's scotch and soda Amsterdam couture
and it's a very pricey store but I
bought these things on a very good price
on sale and the thing I really love
about the store is first of all
everything in it is really cute the
place like the sword looks like a tent
like it's when you go like the outside
of it looks like a tent and it's like
really cool everything comes with a
necklace like if you buy something you
not everything but most things like come
with a necklace or I'll come with a tank
top or something so it's not like you're
ever just buying one thing like you're
also buying something else like included
in the price so that is my favorite part
of the store and I've never seen shore
like do anything like it think I got
that is this taped or it's not this tank
top is this um sweatshirt thing it says
Mason I think I don't even know really
what that means or whatever but it's
cute and then it also came with
underneath this chain top which is
actually cute like it's not bad in a
king sent this like neon like lacy
material tank top it's a quarrel Neal
and pink I guess so i thought that was
cool how it just came with this next
thing i got was also on sale and this
came with a necklace too but it is just
this really cute summary flowy shirt and
it's like pink and then kind of umbria
shitfaced white and i really love it I
think it's so cute and I tried it on and
it makes you look really really tan like
up against your skin tone and stuff and
then it came with this really cute
necklace you think I'm talking about
yeah next door is 82 them and HTM I'm
sorry has gone downhill I don't really
like hmm that much anymore I only got
one thing from there
link to this season they do not have two
things to say in but I got this dress
and I'm not even sure with it so i might
be returning it it doesn't fit me but it
was only ten dollars you guys so i was
like what the heck it is this gray maxi
dress and it has this like Paisley like
darker grades 9 on the way into the
floor and it's just really pretty and it
kind of has like scrunch stuff detailing
at the top and then a ruffle and then it
