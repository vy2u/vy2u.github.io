I am filming my morning routine so this
is my summer morning routine and I'm so
excited so mist also if you guys are new
to my channel hi I'm so glad you're
watching this please subscribe if you
guys want to I post videos every Tuesday
and Friday so yeah be sure to join in on
the fun the Natalie nation maybe we can
call ourselves that I kind of like the
Barbie dolls because it's like Barbie
dolls - I don't know I'm just talking
cause not a lot what time you guys
normally wake up and what your morning
routine typically looks like besides
compared to mine I would love to know I
just love having a lot of comments in
the comments so please comment as much
as you want just like have conversation
with me I will respond to them you
definitely do not want to miss out on my
upcoming videos because I'm going to be
traveling a lot more so I'm so excited
about that I also have a vlog channel
that I literally haven't posted in in
forever but I'm going to post when I
travel because I'll actually be doing
fun things and I'm traveling for about a
month starting on Sunday so yeah be sure
to follow me on there but where this
intro is 20 minutes long less this was
started in the video so in the morning I
actually do still set an alarm even
though it is summer time I just like
getting started with my day early I feel
very unproductive if I wake up past nine
o'clock so I always try to wake up
around 8:00 and I actually recently gone
up a lot and I have been absolutely
loving it this is the first serie so
it's not the newest one but it's great I
really really like it so I always stood
on in the morning and then in the
morning as much as I hate to say I do
check social media I do want to start
not checking that the first thing but
realistically I do I love checking
Instagram I check your guys DMS I'll
reply to some of them go on Twitter I if
anyone has mentioned me and then I go on
snapchat and I love snapchat you guys so
if you haven't added me please be sure
to do that
I definitely post a lot on snapchat and
Instagram stories I don't know which one
I like that so comment which one you
guys like better and which one I should
post more on snapchat or Instagram
stories and then I get out of bed I
don't like coming
which charm of social media now get out
of bed and the first thing I like to do
not every morning but some morning is
make my bed I just feel very productive
once I do that and if I make it first
thing in the morning then they will
crawl back into it afterwards
so it's just a good way to start your
day I think it makes you start off on
the right foot and also will make your
room look so much neater even if there's
stuff everywhere if your bed is made
your room just looks ten times better it
let me know if you guys agree or if you
don't and then I head over to wash my
face and brush my teeth I have been
using the acne orc products I've talked
about that in my skincare routine you
guys want to watch that you guys can
click on the little card is that all ad
or in the description below only kit but
yeah I've been absolutely loving it I've
already bought my second purchase from
there so I really think it's a great
great company and it completely cleared
up my skin I swear by it so make sure my
face dries from all the serums and
things that I put on it before it my
moisturizer but then the best part of my
day is getting breakfast so today I just
decided to go out to meet with my best
friend Katie I normally don't go out to
eat breakfast but I thought especially
since I was filming this and be a good
way to show you guys one of my favorite
breakfast spots in Charlotte this is
rush espresso bar highly recommend going
there they have amazing food they have
such cute coffee and just I love it so
much it's definitely my favorite place
kit breakfast
I started off with eggs and avocado and
then I work out so I'll give it about an
hour to digest but I'm going to give you
guys a little tips on fun ways to work
out the summer so the number one thing I
do is go to the gym I've been absolutely
loving to you the Calif program which
I'll show you in a little bit but I just
put on my music and then turn on the
sweat app I've been loving this I use
her BB Jay stronger and yeah so it
incorporates equipment at the gym and
since I do have a gym near me I just
walk there and use the equipment and
it's a love it I've definitely been
seeing results and I just want to make
sure that you guys know that to be
healthy it's not necessarily to be super
skinny so super skinny should not people
it could be to be strong and I think I
want you guys all to know that that just
because you don't weigh a certain amount
on the scale does not mean that you're
not healthy
that in mind I've actually gained like
10 pounds since I've been doing this and
then I also like doing yoga I don't do
it every single day but I try doing it
and often as I can because it's a really
good workout and it stretches your
muscles and then it surely like it and
then I only block back on the gym
because I feel like that helps and some
packs
I love rollerblading this is something I
just recently picked up with my
boyfriend
I got rollerblades on Amazon for super
cheap so they're not the best but we
like going on little rollerblading dates
and it's a lot of fun and it's actually
a really really really really good
workout since then I shower once I get
back and I actually like not putting
heat on my hair over the summers I've
been using the sea salt spray by matrix
and I've been loving it and while my
hair is drying and while I'm getting
ready for my day I just like to plan it
out so I've actually started bullet
journaling thumbs this video up if you
guys want a bullet journal video but
I've been starting the bullet journal
and so I like planning out my day and
making to-do lists I live by to-do list
because it just helps me be productive
and know what I have to do so that is
what I have been doing really really
helped me staying on top of things and
after I'm done planning my day I just go
on and start living my day so that's
about it for my morning routine I don't
think I've enjoyed the video let me know
what you think down below and please
subscribe give this video thumbs up I'll
be on Instagram all of that good stuff
that would mean the world to me I'll
have everything links down below but
yeah just have a conversation in the
comments I would really really like that
that's like I love having conversations
with you guys so just comment anything
at all down below love having
interaction and I'll see you guys on
Tuesday bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
