lookbook yeah definitely and make sure

yeah we are just shootin people are
probably thinking that we're like crazy
and weird but oh well gotta do what you
gotta do yep offer a video for you guys
so this first alpha is a super pretty
white dress it's a very flowy and casual
white dress I obsessed with it I really
like the open back and kind of the
opening line to it I don't know I don't
have anything like it and I just think
it is absolutely gorgeous it's also from
Windsor com I will link everything down
below and coincidentally my whole alpha
is from Windsor I just got a bunch of
their things in the mail because i went
online shopping so I decided to do a
look book on it so the bag and the shoes
are also Windsor and my earrings are
actually from a small routine bit under
us so I don't know where you can find
those and then at my necklace is from
altered state and I really like it it's
just uh North Carolina and necklace and
it has carolina blue color so i'm not
that big of a fan but you know it's
still a pretty cute necklace so I love
Grace's alpha I think it's so cute with
all right and the pops of color her
scarf is actually from target so you can
definitely get that anywhere just any
hot pink scarf and I really like how her
lipstick from Mac actually kind of
matches the scarf it's from Mac
obviously and it's candy yum yum and
then her pants are from impressions
boutique and I love white ripped pants
her button-down is from Korea actually
so i'm not sure if you could actually
find it anywhere but it is just a white
button-down her shoes out of the
gorgeous pop of blue and they are from a
mi clubwear and then her sunglasses are
calico and I just absolutely love itself
in her accessories i'm always on Polly
yeah I really loved it all white and I'm
definitely trying to kind of go for a
little more all white this summer just
because it's white I've really grown
it's really grown on me a kind of
transition from black to white of course
I will always wear my black pieces but I
just really love how grateful is all
right so this outfit is super fun and I
absolutely love it I feel like I mean a
tropical place like Hawaii or something
like that when I wear it that the dress
is some blazer and it's absolutely
gorgeous I really love the outline of it
and of course the open back my wedges
are from target and then my hat is
actually graces so I don't really know
where thats from but she want me borrow
it and then my necklace is from j.crew
but yeah this alpha is just so stunning
and I cannot wait to wear this this
summer whenever I go on vacation because
you then no I'm going to wear it all the
time everybody to go on but yeah all the
links will be in the downbar below and
yeah I absolutely love stress
so Grace's second alpha is super
polished and put together yet you can
definitely wear it to class or just any
time during the summer cuz it's not
going to weigh you down her vest is from
forever 21 and that's basically what
makes all the look look really polished
the vest so that's what I really love
about that her t-shirt is just from
Luciana em and it's just any graphic to
you could wear with some ripped denim
shorts I really love the boyfriend
shorts I think they're so cute and kind
of a summer version of the boyfriend
Jean her shorts are from forever 21
actually and her booties are also from
ami clubwear just like her other ones
and then her bag is actually from
windsor store calm it's the same bag I
was wearing in my very first alpha and
her 88 errs are laid bands so yeah I'd
really about how she just kind of looks
put together yet she's still wearing
like the boyfriend Jean in the graph of
tea so basically all you need to add to
look a little more put together is just
a super cute vest
so make sure you check out gracefully me
calm and her Instagram I will like
everything down below but she always is
posting her outfits and yeah I just
really love her style so definitely
