and real literally just woke up I really
want to make these videos very real for
you guys so that is why I've been trying
to just kind of not spend so much time
on like the editing in the filming
necessarily but more on like hey this is
what I really look like in the mornings
this is what I really sound like I'm
gonna move you guys though because the
lighting is kind of weird right now I am
just in my bathroom this morning
literally just woke up and I want to
take you guys through my skincare
routine my skincare routine is
essentially the same morning and night I
put my hair up cuz we cannot have the
hair going in there and you don't need
to make it cute it's just it's just put
it over your face let me close my toilet
because you guys are like contouring
above my toilet and if you fall you're
falling in there for my face wash I have
been using glam glow well I've been
using glam glow as a face wash this is
the super cleanse it's clearing creams
it's the morning okay cleaning cream to
foam cleanser this one I have been
absolutely loving this video also is not
sponsored just so you guys know but yeah
I've been really really liking this it's
almost out actually I just have been
obsessively loved face masks and their
face wash actually I feel like my skin
literally has not had one tiny pimple
since I have been starting using this so
I highly recommend
after I wash my face I have become
obsessed but this is not new I like
loved this so much this tea tree water
it from lush and I love tea tree oil
firm believer that it really really
helped clear out of my skin hey I like
this one because it's more than gentle
and it's not just tea tree oil lady at
lush was telling me that it's like a
calmer toner and it's really really
refreshing so I just spray this all over
my face and as I'm waiting for that to
dry I don't rub it in or I don't put it
on a cotton pad as I wait for it to dry
I brush my teeth because then it will
just dry and after I put my next thing
on it's fine I never put like wet on wet
I guess like I have to have my skin care
products dry I don't know if that's just
me I don't know if it's better for it I
don't know it's I I just I have to do
that and my teeth I go in with this
product you guys have seen this before
in my last skincare routine it is the
acne gorg treatment I highly recommend
acne gorg for anyone who's struggling
with acne I'm gonna have my previous
skincare video linked down below because
I used to have really bad acne and it
was just like I felt so insecure so
those of you with skin that is not clear
and you have breakouts and they're super
visible and you just feel so insecure
I completely understand like it is
literally having bad skin I think it's
the worst feeling like that is just
something that like when you're not
comfortable in your own skin is horrible
so I totally get it and it has taken me
a lot of years to kind of like have
clear skin again this is definitely
still something I have in my routine I
still like the face wash and I was using
it up until I came to LA it was just too
big to bring here on a plane so I just
decided on the glam glow one but
literally have not broken out once since
but I just put this treatment it's just
like a tiny tiny amount all over my face
and I just feel like it's a good barrier
especially from like the bad air here
and pollution and just like any bad
thing that could
contact with your skin I feel like this
is kind of like a shield for it and also
what kills any bacteria since it has
benzoyl peroxide and pretty sure that's
what benzoyl peroxide says correct me if
I'm wrong though I really don't I'm not
100% sure after that I use this glow
recipe watermelon pink juice moisturizer
this one is like such an underdog for me
I got this for free as in a PR package
and I just tried it thinking like I just
want to try it out you know whatever I
became obsessed with it first of all the
smell is unreal it's such a strong smell
but like not annoying it you know it's a
watermelon smell and it's so summery and
I just put two squirts or two pumps and
just put it all over it and it's using
moisturizes my face so much it's such
like a nice feeling on my skin and like
a cool refreshing feeling I don't know
for you orally skin girls out there you
need a moisturizer like don't think
because your skin is oily that you don't
need them which aren't sorry because if
you never put oil on your skin your
pores and your skin is kind of over
produce oil and then you're gonna become
more oily and break out even more so
don't be afraid of things that are not
oil-free I think that was one of the
things the big reasons why I was
breaking out and I always use oil free
things and then I realized and my
dermatologist was like no no no you need
oil like you need to moisturize it's so
important for your skin especially when
you're putting harsher products on there
like this product for example has a
benzoyl peroxide which is a really harsh
product so I need something to
moisturize and hydrate my skin that is
all I do in the morning but I'm gonna
show you guys some other products that I
use just like throughout the week take
my makeup off with Garnier micellar
makeup removing towelettes I'm obsessed
with Garnier I have been using Garnier
makeup removing towels for maybe like 7
years like forever these are my favorite
ones they're gentle but they do the job
and they don't burn your eyes a lot of
makeup remover wipes even if they say
that they're gentle they always burn my
eyes for some reason you don't think
your makeup off before bed what are you
just sayin and then my favorite mask is
this glow of youth mud tingle
exfoliating treatment exfoliating is so
important you guys I've said that before
but it's seriously so important so I
highly recommend getting either an
insulating face wash or an exfoliating
mask that you use often this one I try
using once a week but honestly I
probably should be using it more it also
burns your face but it's like a good
burn it feels like it's really working
and my skin literally like looks soft
like not only feels soft but like it
looks like you just peeled a whole layer
off my skin which sounds gross but it's
amazing so yeah I've been really really
loving this because exfoliating is so
important that it's for my skincare
routine I really really hope that guys
enjoyed this I hope it was informative
and they got anything from it but yeah
if you have bad skin
I completely understand it's literally
the worst feeling in the world and don't
like it will get better I promise
it really will especially once you find
the right products and I also want to
mention it's an aniline birth control
and I originally got on that for my acne
so if any of you guys are going your
interment ologist and your parents are
okay with it if you're under 18
obviously with you going on birth
control that is something that helped
clear my skin because I have very more
monel acne too so just so that you guys
know is that and wanting to like put
that out there because I definitely
think that that is a huge contributor to
how I clear my skin but anyways
everybody guys enjoyed this video give
it a thumbs up let me know if you want
other videos similar to this or if you
like to the style video very like calm
show and like in real time be sure to
subscribe if you're new here follow me

love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
