today I am filming a summer haul for you
guys of course I'm video I just want to
let you guys know that naked I think you
pronounce it in a /kv
fashion and they sent me a bunch of
things so I'm doing kind of like an
unboxing haul for you guys and it's kind
of one of Paul because I already unboxed
it and let me tell you the stuff it's so
freakin cute they just have many things
to kind of try on see if I like it and I
chose some things off their website so I
just want to give it a disclaimer before
us on this video but I'm not sure you
that you guys love everything that I got
because it is so my style like so if you
guys have been following me and you like
my style that this is like honey percent
my style so let me get the console of
what your favorite thing is and yeah
before we get started into this haul I
want to let you guys know that I have a
discount code for you guys so I am so
excited for that because I love you some
discount codes and I know I can you see
this haul you guys will use this to
scalp co2 but it is 20 not only Geneseo
a thumbs up if you like it and go check
out their Instagram down below because
their feed it's like so so cute so
hopefully I make it on there someday
guys are subscribe to my channel make
sure that you guys are subscribed
because the summer and posting a lot of
videos and I'm really empowering for
video requests and don't really know
what to film it I'm really delicious
that started with this video so for the
first piece I am actually wearing it
right now so it is this gorgeous top so
it is this justice black off the
shoulder top and then it has um like a
choker attached to it attached in the
back so yeah it's crap I'm rainy with
some higher or wasted brandy melville
jeans but this shirt is so pretty I'm
obsessed with it this is the back this
is a try on also you guys will get to
see everything but I decided to wear
this outfit today so that's why I'm
showing you guys it is literally like so
cute camera focus focus camera okay I
don't know why my camera is like
focusing and
it's it on auto loan easy the next time
trying guys is going to be in bathing
suits
so this first bathing suit that I got is
also extremely cute and I'm gonna say
that how everything's I'm gonna try to
limit how many times I say cute in this
video this is the top of it and it's a
high-neck top I've been really loving hi
next things and in the back is just like
super open and loose I guess they are
just some blue tide I bought up so well
I think it they are very summery and I
don't go to the pool or Beach now in
this summer because I am working 40
hours a week I know isn't isn't an adult
life great but when I do the beach
instead we get away I know I mean I'm
what tired of my old age does anyone
else have that feeling where you look
tired of all your clothes and like you
just want to anyone because there's so
much trendier like two years ago five
neck and one pieces were nothing and now
they are so if you're looking to like
stock up on them I got two more mating
suits and the first one or the second
one I should say is this white one piece
which this is my most revealing bathing
suit I think so I don't know like it's
really cute but it is really revealing
it's like a super deep V and it's just a
plain ol white one piece the third main
suit that I got is this one this I think
is the one that you guys will love the
most or kind of know what you guys like
already and I think this is the one that
you like the most or the first one but
it is this one piece and it has like
crisscross at the front and it's a
halter and then it has an open back so
this one is super cute it's like a dark
blue color which I never see in bathing
suits babies are normally white and
bright and colorful and this was very
like classy act like I don't know I
really really love it and again
convinced is a leotard too if you have
some shorts on instead of just a bathing
suit next thing that I got is this tank
top and it is super tiny underneath
through the black tank top you guys I
can't even see yet it is this black tank
top and it
actually have like ties around your
stomach area so it's really cute and so
it's cropped but it's highs around your
stomachs we get extra trendy so you can
wear but I've said or love which two
things doesn't really matter I have been
absolutely loving this piece I think
it's so different and it's like a
hundred million times better material to
brandy melville let me tell you guys it
kind of looks like a brandy thing but
like it's so much better material it's a
lot thicker and doesn't feel like I'm
about to rip it when I stretch it I
don't know I went to brandy Melville the
other day when I was in New York and I
did not see one thing that I liked I was
so disappointed I just feel like their
fabric and their quality and everything
has just gone downhill like their
clothes you should be super super soft
and now I feel like they're like like
t-shirt material it just like sorority
I'm sure the University t-shirt material
and I don't know I don't really like
that much I'm gonna spend money on
something like Cuban Trinity I kinda
wanted to be a better material but yeah
I'm not bashing on brandy melville but I
was just disappointed in it when I went
to New York next thing that I got is
this dress it is a sequined dress and I
feel like kendall Jenner I think it was
last year's Met Gala I think she wore
the green dress is like major side boob
which was so cute so this is the dress
it is again a black dress so I know this
is a summer haul and like most of things
that are black but I mean it's like
short sleeve and stuff so that counts
so yeah it's a black sequins and it has
like the criss cross down the sides I
don't I would like to come on more side
boob action I guess if you have boobs
yeah yeah it's another kind next thing
which I love I cannot wear this to like
a function or something when I'm back at
school and the sequins are not cheap
material at all so I really like it
the next thing that I got is this shirt
and this shirt congratulations natalie
is not black finally for once yeah but
it is this cropped little tiny shirt and
again it's off the shoulder
it has bows on the side which i think is
really really cute and it's kind of like
a light blue grey color it's definitely
more light blue but like on camera it
kinda looks great before I show you guys
this I know you guys are gonna thank you
mr. Newlin get Natalie where do you live
because it's 90 degrees outside where I
live and like why the heck did you buy
each jacket
um yeah good question really when you
see up and you'll understand this guys
so it's like a barn jacket kind of super
cute and played the Cinch
at the wrist and at the collar and it's
just like a super cool jacket I would
totally wear this in the summer and
sweat my face off just because it's so
cute I'm in a room saying I stay for my
video it was kind of a quicker haul than
I normally do but thank you so much to
make a passion for sending me this if
you guys have not checked them out check
them out down below I will have their
link in there don't forget on discount
code if you guys use it let me know tell
me what you guys bought and they have a
lot of different like brands on there
like they have free people and stuff
like that too so if you guys want to go
shopping for those things they

just a little bit more trendy pieces so
