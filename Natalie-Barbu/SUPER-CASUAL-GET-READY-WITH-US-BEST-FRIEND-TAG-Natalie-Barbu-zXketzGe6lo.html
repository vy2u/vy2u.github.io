we should like a best friend tag oh well
we're doing our makeup okay I'm gonna
get my coat okay how and when did you
guys meet actually I was explaining
yesterday to the girl um or the other
day she's like hi Jessie and I was like
honestly we slid into each other's Diaz
yeah it works guys I think she liked her
roommate followed me on Instagram and I
just like saw that she went to Chapel
Hill which was a school really close to
me and I was like creeping on her
roommate and then I like saw that she
had pictures grace so I clicked on grace
and I was like oh this girl's a blogger
and she goes to Chapel Hill so then I
followed her and then I think she
followed me back and like DM to me yeah
I think I like like the ton of her
photos was like she's a cute little Zeta
girl yeah oh my god yeah I was like at
first though I'm not gonna lie I was a
little bit like she's probably one of
those girls cuz like knowing influencers
you know you are just like kind of to
themselves they don't really branch out
kind of thing and I don't know how well
we'd mesh but look at us now
exactly I forgot to put strobe cream and
I already for my foundation on so we're
just gonna mix it in so that's how we
manage that she BM me and then we met
for coffee and
here we are I don't have really many
friends that are like social media
people so it was just nice having
someone to that understood yeah what is
your favorite memory together
I don't we have a lot like yeah this is
my friend that has like the most like
good memories like adventurous like
actually memorable things with like we
do the coolest things I think yeah uh
Fashion Week probably was one of my
favorites I think the first one yeah
yeah the first Fashion Week yeah yeah we
went to Fashion Week last February and
it was just so much fun and like such an
amazing experience and yeah it was
really really nice you went to the
mountains together yeah that was Ben we
like to the hot tub like oh yeah I was a
chairman of that hot dog because it was
like in the middle of the woods and it
was dark and I was like someone's gonna
come and murder us this is the perfect
actually scary movie setting yeah like
we'd like go a little bit into the woods
and we were just like two young girls
staying in this like random abandoned
hot not abandoned but like in the middle
of nowhere like isolated it didn't have
neighbors home and so I was really
really scared of that hot tub and we
were just out there like in bathing
suits and I was like this is a recipe
for like a horror movie for someone to
come out here and murder us so we're
taking her only in there for a little
bit because I probably was like inside
it's cold and in that trip we like
didn't have a tripod and we forgot one
and it was some random house you guys
there's like old people that owned it
and like we were just like oh my god
like we need a tripod like we can't not
have a tripod we were gonna go down to
Best Buy I like down the mountain and
like go to Best Buy which is like 45
minutes away and get a tripod and then
we're just like looking in random
closets throughout the house and there's
a tripod like what are the odds like a
tripod is not something that like oh
yeah it was like it was like board games
like sweaters no tripod yeah and
describe each other in one word grace is
very driven that's how I would describe
her driven and hardworking and kind with
one word that really goes to my way with
you it's like how loyal you are like you
are always there for people you know
like that matter to you and I think
that's something that's like it really
seems that about you and the fact that
you're driven to and thank you yeah all
the above what is something that annoys
you about the other person I don't think
anything like is annoying like I don't
think I've never been like oh whatever
like I don't think we've ever gotten
fired you know like when you're living
with someone or when you're hanging out
with them 24/7 chances are there's any
little things that annoy you about the
person but like I feel like I've never
like been like oh my gosh grace is doing
this and I'm so you know why though is
because we've never one like living with
each other and if we don't like we did
see each other all the time but we
didn't in the most you know like yeah we
aren't together 24/7 so I think that's
also why like I'm sure they've if we
were roommates they would we would
realize some things I know each other
yeah if any of you guys live in New York
comment down below I'd love to know next
time I'm here to do a meet-up grace was
like you should show me - bye you're
here but like I don't know I just I feel
like if I did I meet up no one would
come and I guess it's just like my own
like insecurities doing that but I don't
know if you guys like guys come so now
you know if
where else like in North Carolina or
something if you want me to do a meet-up
I've never done one but I think those
would be really really cool to do who
takes longer to get ready in the morning
actually it depends on what I'm doing of
my hair I think you take longer even
though you have only no steps in your
makeup routine I think I am just a
super-fast getting ready person though
like I'm always the first one of my
family to get ready like way quicker
than my dad what quicker than my brother
sometimes my brother that's pretty quick
but like I'm normally the first one to
get ready out of all my friends always
what is your favorite season
Oh fall pants down fall mine's for sure
summer
I love Oh summer I just like I like the
heat I actually genuinely like the heat
like it's not just like I like it more
than the cold like I like being outside
when it's sunny and like hot more than I
do
look I don't like being hot like indoors
but I like being hot when I'm outside
and I like the fact that there's no
school I like the fact that you can
travel and if anyone says that the cold
is better than the heat which I'm pretty
sure you're someone that says that right
yeah I would rather be cold in heart
you're wrong though because let me
explain to you first are you yeah this
is our first fight let me explain to you
why you're wrong
because when you go outside in the
freezing cold you are in a pain the
second you get outside like 0.5 seconds
outside and you're literally in physical
pain like you feel like times are going
through your body or like your fingers
are frozen you're just like look get me
back inside like you can't even walk
from like the front of the store to your
car because you're so cold and miserable
in the heat if you're outside for like
an hour you end up being miserable but
like if you're outside for like going
from the store to your car you're not
miserable you're not in pain I'm in pain
it's too hot
no you're not that's such a lie that's
why that's my biggest or even they're
like the coldest so much better I'm like
you literally can't go outside without
like being in physical pain like in the
summer you can go outside if you're
outside for like half a day an hour two
hours yeah you're gonna become a like a
little like uncomfortable but you're not
you don't feel like knives are going
through your body so that's my argument
for by the cold is a million times worse
than the heat what is your favorite song
yeah I don't have a resolve neither I
don't have a favorite song I have
favourite sounds like at the moment yeah
but right now I'm like loving Demi
Lovato song tell me you love me it's so
yeah but like I know in like a week
that's not probably not gonna be my
favorite song so it's all right now it's
really getaway car by Taylor's oh my god
I don't know why when I can't it's all
those things alright yeah okay Taylor
Swift's new album thoughts I hated it at
first and now it's really really growing
on me so what do you guys think I feel
like that's just like the Taylor Swift
effect though to like hate it embers and
then love it I really think she has like
a magic spell that she does all those
yeah because they're always bad when I
first listen to them I'm always like you
know just like can't resist it was
amazing I know and then you keep playing
it even though you don't like it yeah
and then you love it and then you love
it yeah it's a similar Swift effect
google it yeah um what is it like being
friends with someone who is obsessed
with YouTube all those things obsessed
with you I was like Natalie oh my god
you know I like it like I don't know
about other people because I like it
because that's your thing you have a
thing oh wait okay yeah and I guess in a
way you understand kind of the whole
social media the influencing and so to
me I like it and I see how much you're
passionate about it and I think that
really drives me to be passionate what I
like to do and so to me I love it okay

is Blackberry or iPhone Blackberry
