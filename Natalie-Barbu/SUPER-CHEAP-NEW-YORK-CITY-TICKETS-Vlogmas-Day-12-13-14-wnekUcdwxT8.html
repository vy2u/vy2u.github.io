so is December 12 and I worked out this
morning and that was fun but sadly I
actually got really really lightheaded
and I love starting my day was working
out because it just sets me on a good
mood the rest of the day I just feel
good my body feels good but I was so
light how did I think it's because I
didn't really have a big dinner the
night before and then I didn't eat
before I worked out so I had to stop
halfway I do the kala thing so I only
did two and like a quarter rounds
because it was just way too hard ah I
really felt like I was gonna die like I
felt like I was about to pass out like
oh and my my nose started feeling weird
and like my head started feeling weird
so like if you guys are working out and
just feel sick or feel light-headed
definitely stop your like health is
better than finishing that workout so
and I know that I always finish the
workouts I don't do that like every time
so I wasn't too worried about it so I
just looked back upstairs and like lay
down drink some water and then I went to
go get the most unhealthy breakfast I
could probably think of so around
Raleigh area we have this point horrible
rise and if any of you guys know event
is the greatest place ever it's biscuits
and Donuts like huevos rancheros donut
or donut no that'd be gross
oh we have also done Cheerios biscuit so
it looks really good this is actually my
first time getting it it has like fried
egg black bean spread onions avocado I
don't know it looks really good and
messy so nice and I got somewhat caught
up on me I also got a potato hash this
has like cheese and onions and it's like
a hash brown but just like a loaded hash
brown
so of course two very healthy thing and
then I got a glazed donut donuts are
like my favorite so I got a glazed donut
as well so yeah I don't know if I'll eat
all of this at once but when you go to
rise you can't not get a donut and a
biscuit and then I just wanted to
hashbrowns so yeah glad I worked out
kind of
this morning this is the setup for my
holiday look
so I'm actually changing it and I'm
actually gonna film on this wall now
instead of my bed but yeah so this is
the look I got all I make up right there
the hairdryer and stuff that I have to
show right there my music playing it's a
makeup look so yeah and then Here I am
with my no makeup gross face but
whatever um so yeah this is the before
and I'll show you guys that I'm done
filming this is the final look you guys
so I will have the video to get this
look down below it's my hair with the
InStyler smoother like it is so smooth
you guys I'm trying to like pick up the
smoothness but I don't know if I can but
yeah my hair is so soft and voluminous I
love it so yeah this is the look as I
said already and now I really gotta go
steady because I added this video which
will probably take like 3 hours and then
I have to study and it's already like
almost 3 o'clock like I have an exam
tomorrow oh well I'm about to head over
to the library so I don't know if I will
vlog at all there because I am not
kidding when I say I have not studied
for my exam on Wednesday and it's
actually gonna be really hard so I am
really gonna try to focus as much as I
can so I apologize if I do not vlog I
just know myself I probably won't
honestly but yeah I just want to let you
guys know that that's what I'm doing
right now so dreading it but that is
what I'm doing so yeah be sure to check
out my holiday video if you guys are
bored of this one have it linked down
below I just got back from the library
and I made myself some tea and I'm
drinking it in this one step at a time
elephant mug that my boyfriend got me
it's so cute as my favourite mug and I'm
lighting some candles and my salted
caramel candle my pumpkin pecan pecan
around I say it any other way but um
that candle I'm kind of like delusional
exhausted like I can't function because
I haven't even been studying that long I
just have a headache and I just hate
studying and whatever so yeah kinda
finals I'm just done but I'm not done I
still have two more exams
just like most of my exams are in the
next two days I'm already done so that's
not good oh yeah I think I'm just
calling down review the exam for
tomorrow set 20,000,000 alarms so that I
don't force late because it's an 8 a.m.
exam and then I'm just gonna combine
today's and tomorrow's vlog because I

watching and stay tuned for the next day
I am officially done with a semester so
I just took my last final exam of the
semester and I actually didn't think it
was too bad so that was good even though
a lot of people thought it was hard so
that makes me kind of worried but of a
long time who cares it's December 14th I
believe and I'm so excited I am packing
up to go home so now the vlogs will be
more than just me studying because I
won't be sitting at oh I'm so excited
but who knows maybe I'll just be lying
in bed all day and then it'll be even
less entertaining

break and I'm going to Florida so I'm
really excited and yeah sorry for not
vlogging yesterday I just had a final
and then I had to study for another one
