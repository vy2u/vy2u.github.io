seeds and it was so funny I left this
they left the spoon like in the chia
seed bag open this girl would go to use
it you guys at yeah like they give you a
really nice spoon to scoop with I pull
it out and it's like a spoon from our
kitchen I left it in there I like put it
away in the pantry already that's funny
so I am officially the worst vlogger
ever I went to some coffee shop with my
friend and I like didn't vlog at all but
you know it's okay I'm kind of getting
the hang of it I'm just laying in my bed
right now my makeup looks like really
weird cuz I didn't bring any makeup home
I'm just using Chloe's and so like she
look barely has any makeup now in a lot
of it I like still have some old makeup
home like that I didn't take to school
but it's like summer foundation so it's
it's just like looking really some
watching right now and she doesn't have
concealer like low come on come on but
um I am just laying in bed i'm actually
watching Aspen and Parker and I am I
have to actually edit a video today and
upload it today because um some skin
care company come the camp talk some
skin care company contacted me and they
wanted me to do a video with them so I'm
doing a morning routine and I'm kind of
like showing the skin care products and
they actually are great and you guys
must be like a Natalie you have pimples
on your face like but no they actually
are good i had a lot more pimples than
this guy's believe it or not this is
actually pretty good and you know when
you use a skincare thing like a like
takes out all the dirt so like all the
dirt rises to the surface and then you
like break out a little bit for like a
week and then you like get better so
that's what's happening to me now but it
actually cleared up a lot believe it or
not so and these are this one's going
away this one should be gone
soon this one's going away basically
it's like almost gone it's just kind of
like a scar and then this one needs to
go away this one's still kind of there
