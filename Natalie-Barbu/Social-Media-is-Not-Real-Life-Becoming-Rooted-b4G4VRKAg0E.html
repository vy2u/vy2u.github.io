i'm covering if you guys with a becoming
rooted video so this is I haven't Tom
Douglas having your new video in a while
because katie and i'm around spring
break so we tied to take a break on
spring break and then i had done two
weekends in red shoes every weekend 0 so
it's been pretty consistent besides the
spring break weekend but but now it's my
turn to soma video for you guys and i'm
so excited because this is definitely
something that is in place on my heart
to talk about for those of you guys that
don't know what the coming greeted is i
will have it in the description down
below and also you can check it out it's
not really affiliated with my channel
like it is but it's not my channel it's
a website that my friend and i have and
we just broadcast it to our individual
audiences like her on her blog me on my
youtube but they're separate from it if
that makes sense so ya better this is
here I just want to talk about kind of
like issues i know that's a very broad
word know like what um but I went out to
dinner actually the other night and I
was with three of my best friends and we
were all talking about like just random
things we were talking about so many
things dinner conversations where you go
from talking we literally started
talking about like nutrition and then we
started talking about the Illuminati and
I we started talking about like
depression and anxiety and all this
stuff like I don't even know how the
conversation p move out but yeah let's
cut off when we are talking about kind
of Edwin's own personal issues
everyone's own personal like struggles
that they deal with I was kind of just
sitting at the table taking it all in
being like well like people don't like
it so easy to say and look at someones
instagram with its on Twitter look at
someone's youtube channel and be like oh
my gosh they have a perfect life like I
wish my life was perfect you're like
they're so perfect they're so pretty
they have money they must not have like
a care in the world like look at me over
here struggling with depression anxiety
and like I can't pay my rent and I'm
going to struggling so much you know and
like you just use someone else and you
wish you want to be them and you wish
that you had with their like they don't
have any issues at all like their life
is perfect
people think that to us based off of
like Instagram sadly and I'm Instagram
in the highlight reel by the way I just
want to point that out I definitely did
not come up with that quote but I want
to share it because it's so true and I
was just thinking like all the dudes
these roles on sitting with I was like
scroll through their page found out was
that and like heard about their family I
heard about their like like whatever and
then like oh my gosh your life is
perfect like you what are you going to
travel so much gets her but you guys
have a lot of money or you guys are like
always happy here you guys aren't
stressed out in school and you get good
grades and I'm jealous of that and i'm
jealous like you're in a major that you
love whatever like everything like i
have once compared my life to theirs and
put theirs on the higher pedestal in
mind like it's just inevitable all of us
do it it's really sad but it's human
when we were talking about that one of
my friends was talking about how she's
been like how she has anxiety and like
all of them kind of like Olivia me tune
was a lot of people are on medication
for anxiety which I would think is a
good thing I don't think it's bad you
need help please go seek it but it
sounds like at a bad thing to talk about
and it has such a stigma to it that it's
like oh like you're on anxiety meds like
crazy no it's not like that but a lot of
people don't see that like I one of my
friends if you would never think that
she is anything wrong with her she is
such a great family she's a loving
family she has she's like death good
grades she's smart she's pretty gorgeous
like everything you know like if she
travels all the time I mean you think
you are perfect and then you hear about
her side of the story and you realized I
like wow they have things going on too
and like I never once thought of that
we're just kind of want to make that
unknown I'm not going to go delve into
the secrets and things that people have
just because I don't think it's my place
to share what other sport going through
but you would be so surprised with what
other people are going to through is it
don't seem like it like for instance I
had people come up to me being like oh
my gosh I'm so jealous you literally
travel everywhere because like I post a
lot of pictures whenever I travel
I just came back from Europe for like
what is legal in college normal college
students don't casually go to Europe you
know and like I'm i always am in New
York and going to New York next week I
have like a place in Miami like I'm in
Miami a lot like I've been to California
you know things like that like saying
this I'm saying rattles off the list and
like wow yeah that's awesome with me
like I'm not awesome of me but like if I
owe someone else I'd be like oh my gosh
that's such a cool life whatever and I'm
not saying I don't have a cool way like
I love my life and I'm so thankful and
I'm so blessed and like so so fortunate
so I just want to throw that out there
like I'm not bashing on my life at all
and I wouldn't trade it for a thing what
I'm sayin like that's not my whole life
like Spence abstraction of it that's
literally just fractionally everyone has
their own issues no was like one hundred
percent perfect and I feel like social
media really really really excuse that
also people can also post a million
selfies in a million cool pictures and
cool me edit in like super fun like
their Instagram I look amazing whatever
and they might be the most insecure
person you'll ever meet and I have seen
that so many times and it's really sad
because you're like why you look so
happy like I found that you went here
like you look so happy with you will
take your having so much fun you've so
many friends like your clothes are 0 and
so cute and put together like your life
looks perfect it's like guys that is you
are literally seeing this much of
someone's life but a little square and
like a sliver of it and then was like
logging for example your toe they're
taking me throughout their bodies like
they're bringing a camera around like
I'm actually seeing like look at this
long as you watch and see how long they
are there was like 10 minutes long and
10 min to come you're holding infinite
out of 24 hours I can put on a file for
10 minutes and i'm not saying that it's
fake at all of them not saying people
are saying nothing that's what they do I
am just saying that like don't turn want
to like trade your life for someone
else's because it looks perfect because
you have no idea what people are going
through people are going to a lot
actually and if you actually sat down
and talked to some people I think you'd
be so surprised like I know friends that
have like depression and anxiety and
have been on meds for years and for
people who have eating disorders or
recovering eating disorders or some
people who
you're into drugs you know and I'm not
saying names of us saying if these are
my close friends is not but I'm saying
there are people like that that looks so
happy on that on the profile or on a
phone screen and we're even like when
you meet them for a second they look
happy but once you talk to them for more
than five minutes and you might get them
to open up and there is so much that
people don't realize and that people
don't broadcast and just think about
yourself like when you post a picture of
you crying yourself to sleep with no but
he wants a picture of you like taking
your anxiety medicine and having an
anxiety attack no but people have that
and like you might have that most of you
guys probably have things like this like
you're thinking of like yep that's me
and I just want you have to know that
you're not alone and that for me at
least and for a little becoming rigid
stance for prayer is everything God can
lead you out of whatever you have and if
you guys on the Christian that's okay
with you don't need to like I'm not
shutting this down your throat I'm just
telling you my beliefs and what I think
and I mean you guys if you just fell in
love with Jesus and he can bring you
through whatever he's going to right now
not saying that you're gonna have a
perfect life because you won't no one
does but it gets so much better than
there is a light at the end of it and I
don't know I just really want to share
that because after that toss my friends
I felt like oh my gosh like so many
people are going through so much that we
don't know about and I know that there's
worse issues going on in the world like
more than just being depressed but this
is something that I feel like is so
crucial our society with people my age
and some things that people don't talk
about and I want to talk about it so
yeah I felt really like I want to be
like me and you are having dinner right
now that I'm opening up to you and you
guys can open up to me in the comments
you guys owe me an email you guys can be
on me on instagram whatever but or
comment on becoming radiant we actually
have forums that you guys can talk to
others about we want this coming to be
an ongoing community for like in any we
are not directly responding like people
are responding to you and like you can
have friends on the website
stuff like that so everything is totally
free i really hope that you guys can use
it and write down any prayer requests
anything that is going through and
people will be there and that's really
nice having a sense of community so if
you guys feel with you guys r load and
don't have that i want to be that for
you katie wants to be there for you so
yeah i know this is kind of like a sappy
video and not one of my normal one
because it's not it's the coming radius
but i really hope today you guys enjoyed
this and make something out of it be
