I am coming to you with a halt and I
have not done a halt in a really long
time so I'm excited to do one of these
because I really liked filming halls
they're easy to film and I like kind of
showing with you guys what I got it
places and just kind of saying what you
guys have to say about it so anyways I'm
just going to jump right into it and I
don't have individual bags for the
source but I just have one big bag that
I put all my stuff in so the first place
is sephora that i'm going to show you
and I have got this Makeup Forever aqua
cream it's waterproof which I'm excited
about because they're I can wear it
seemed like colorful makeup in the
summer at the pool I know I don't wanna
make up to the pool but you know just
DJ's I want to it's purple and it is so
pretty I think I'm gonna do a tutorial
with this eventually I don't know
exactly when but if you guys can see
it's a really really like lavender color
purple I don't know I really like it i
think it's so pretty and i just really
like the color purple and it glides on
so easily it's so pigmented Makeup
Forever these aqua creams I definitely
recommend them to anyone that wants kind
of like a like a creamy eyeshadow
because these are the best ones they
last forever and they are really live
pigmented so I really like it next thing
I got at sephora and the last thing i
got is this Kat Von D tattoo liner it
was actually recommended by the guy that
works there this is what it looks like I
think kind of looks really cool because
she's a tattoo artist so she kind of
like did a cool design but it's
definitely my favorite eyeliner if you
can see the the tip of its felt tip it's
super easy to apply it's pretty much
liquid liner for dummies like you know
those dummy books this is a liquid liner
for dummies you can it's super super
easy to make a winged eyeliner it's
super easy to make a thick line and then
super easy to make like the thinnest
line ever so I recommend this to anyone
I believe that was $19 but yeah I think
that this is the best eyeliner that I
have found ok now I'm just going to go
into the clothing with jump right into
some random stores so the first thing i
got was that Nordstrom and it's this
tank top it's just a very pretty summer
tank top it's a very light pink
kind of cropped and then my favorite
part of it is the sleeves have flowers
all over them so it's really um summary
kind of bohemian I guess and then the
back is like that next thing I got is
from victoria secret and I got it I
guess it's called like a brawl way I
don't really know what it's called I
think this was called like the date
night bro but I don't know it's this
like bra thing it's not line and it
doesn't have padding on I but it's good
if you're not very busty because you
don't really need padding um but yeah I
wear this instead of as like bandos
sometime I think it looks really pretty
and it's it doesn't it's not like too
revealing unless you have like really
really like big like really big boobs
then I guess they would like pop out but
i don't so this works perfect for me I
just wear as a bandeau and I think it's
a very pretty color and i also have a
blue one of these that i got as well but
I got it another time next thing I
thought was another bra which I feel
kind of weird showing you guys my bras
but they're more like bandos this is
like a bandeau bra do you see how it has
lace so I lost my one from mark neagle
which I would wear like every day in the
summer so I got one from true seeker and
I'm happy that they had it and I just
like it because I wear these as bandos
so if I had like a see-through shirt I
don't have to wear bad no I could just
wear this because it doesn't look like a
bra when it's on or under a shirt next
thing that guys from nordstrom I believe
yeah it is and it is this denim like
romper if you guys can see I really like
it i think i'm not a big fan of the
overall trend i think i like it but I'm
not like I feel like it's look I don't
know if I'm like daring enough to
actually try it off myself so this is
pretty close to the overall trend but
still keeping it safe it's just a denim
romper it has like the shorts at the
bottom and then a drawstring right there
and I just like how its buttons up all
the way at the top I think this will be
super cute with my wedges in the summer
if you want to dress it up or you could
just wear with some like toms and or
flip-flops or whatever next like a guys
from nordstrom again
and it is this really really pretty
dress it's orange it's kind of an Elan
ish orange and it has these really
pretty like flower design details on it
and I loved it so much I think it's
gonna be so pretty just for a nice
summer like something like fancy that
I'm going to in the summer I don't know
what that will be but I don't really
know how the sleeves go I don't really
know he has like this thing at the top
but this is what it looks like it's
pretty fancy I wouldn't wear it just on
every other day but if I haven't brunch
I'm going to you or like some fancy like
event I'll just wear this again from
nordstrom I got this shirt it's really
cute reminds me kind of a mexico and i'm
going to mexico this summer so maybe
i'll wear it there it's has this like
stretchy material at the top of the
sleeve so i think you can wear it like
off the shoulder and then it's just
cropped and it has these really pretty
design on it and I love love love the
color i think this blue is so pretty and
i don't have very many blue like
articles of clothing and i just really
like the color blue so I was excited to
get this my next purchase airs a pair of
shoes and they are converse but these
are some really cool converse I have
high top white converse already and I
really like them but I thought these
were a lot cuter they have a little like
dirt at the top but that's on purpose
like it's like purposely like rough and
bunch of tears but it doesn't have a you
don't tie laces and it's just like
stretchy so they're really really
comfortable and I like the fact that
they're like look worn an already and
just the blue color I think it's really
pretty and different for some shoes and
then the next thing that I got are some
shoes from Topshop and you guys are guys
are going to love or hate these I'm not
quite sure they kind of remind me of
kindergarten choose their these shoes I
don't know are these like Mary Jane's or
something i'm not really sure if that's
what they're called um yeah they have
their kind of like a I don't even know
what time material they are but I
thought they were cute you guys might
hate them but I really like them and
they were only let's see the price isn't
on there but I think they were only like
fifteen dollars so i was excited when i
got these because i actually originally
went up to them by actually like
then and then I found out they were
fifteen dollars so it's like mmm I
should check these out and they fit me
and i think i can find like some cute
outfits to wear with them it all depends
on the outfit that you wear with it so
make or break it you know and then i got
one other thing that I think that you
guys will love so much and just gonna
run to my closet and get it real fast
okay so as you guys my know I had my
prom like last weekend if you follow me
on instagram you would have seen prom
pictures and I was I already had a dress
I bought it from a friend so it was
really really cheap so I was glad i
didn't spend a lot of money on it and i
sold my dress from last year so i also
had that money so it's like i didn't
spend that much money on both my dresses
last year and this year since I mean I
smell a lot of wedding last year on my
dress that i sold it so it cancelled out
but yeah so i was very happy with my
cheap finds and then when i went to
Florida the week before me and my mom
saw this dress and we really really
liked it and we didn't know my mom it
was on sale so my mom just figured you
might as well just get it and you might
wear it to prom if you want to you can
decide later I decided to stick with my
original dress just because I thought it
was more promise the support summary but
yeah I'm regardless I'm so obsessed with
this dress so it's like neon orange but
it has gold features the mall has like
gold specks and then you guys can see it
and it's just more like really pretty
makes me look really tan and then my
favorite part is the back of the dress
which has an open back and I thought
that was super pretty in that skirt made
it more pro me but anyways I love this
dress so I bought it just because in
case I have anything else to go to
that's kind of fancy like this I already
have it
and also I always shorten a design
wanted to and then where is like a short
dress for the summer or I'm i was
thinking in college I don't think I'm
gonna join a sorority but in case
someone invites me to like their college
formal is like a date or something I
could I always have a dress to wear so
yes so that's why I bought it and I ho
it was super super cute and i swore i
bought some more things but i guess not
so this is kind of a short call let me
know what you guys think of what I got
and then leave in the comments below um
if you like what your favorite item was
