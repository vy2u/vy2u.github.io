makeup tutorial
not only have I not film the video and
so long but I haven't done the makeup
tutorial in even longer so I hope that
you guys enjoy this I'm just gonna kind
of jump right into it it is a summer
kind of more like you can wear in the
daytime you can wear in the nighttime
it's just great for a summer night out
because not every single night you need
to have a smoky eye so this is just more
for a summer night out it's perfect all
the colors remind me perfectly of summer
and if I never go to like a formal event
or something I would probably wear this
look if it's like I mean depends on what
I'm wearing but like just I'm just
wearing short shorts and a tank top
right now and I just went and had like
ran errands with my mom and I think it's
perfect and so leave comments below in
other video requests that you want let
me know how you like this makeup
tutorial the lighting is kind of weird
their colors don't show up as great as
they can but still I hope that you guys
can get the idea of it and yeah like
just let me know how your summers been
what your plans are for the Fall as for
me I am going to college in the fall so
it's a big deal
um I mean yeah just let me know your
plans let me know what how are you like
this video let me know any video
requests I'm going to just me roll in a
few days and I'm going to meet something
outfit of the days there and yeah so I'm
just gonna jump right into this I hope
you guys have an awesome summer and I
will see you guys later
you
okay so to get started I didn't want to
put a concealer on just because in the
summer I don't really need concealer but
I did want to brighten my eyes just in
case those long summer nights we don't
get any sleep so I just did an eye
brightener instead of using concealer
just because I would rather not have my
makeup eat you cookie and then I put on
a BB cream because again I don't want
anything cakey I just want something
very light as you can tell I don't have
very many blemishes in the summer so all
I'd want is just a little coverage and
it also has SPF which is good so we use
the loo L'Oreal you code BB cream and
then I like to add bronzer just to kind
of make my face match my skin just
because even in this hour my face still
gets or still doesn't get as tan as my
body so I just like to match it with
that and then after that I'm gonna
proceed to use a blush and I am actually
using a hot pink blush but if you just
dab your brush into the blush then it
won't be too strong as you can tell I
don't like very strong blush but I just
wanted to get the hot pink color on my
cheeks and then I'm going to be using a
primer for my eyes just to make sure I
last all day because my eyelids get very
oily in the summer and I'm using this
new sexy Tropez
tropics whatever Too Faced eyeshadow
palette gosh I don't know why that was
so hard to say I'm just using a
champagne color on my lid and on my
highlight just to start it off as a base
and then I'm just going to jump right
into the actual like half later color
it's going to be using the jargon these
are all like cities and they're up and I
don't know how to pronounce them so I
feel really uneducated but anyways I'm
putting this orange e coral color on my
lid and then I'm putting that or
champagne orange
on my crease but I am blending it out
and you can actually stop here with the
eyeshadow if you wanted to but I wanted
to do a little bit more smokey then I'm
using Soleil and I'm if that's the dark
brown color and I'm putting that
actually inside my crease just to darken
it up and again you can't stop anywhere
you want for that I shadowed it all
depends on how dramatic you wanna make
it then I'm going to be using Monaco and
I'm going to be using a highlights brush
which this is a bamboo brush and just
putting it on the outer lid and a little
bit on my crease just to make it flow
nicely and again you can stop right here
if you want to I'm just blending it out
and then just to make sure I don't have
any harsh lines going back in with my
first or my second lid color and I'm
just making sure I haven't blended and
just kind of making it reappear because
I don't want it to have gone away now
I'm using my Urban Decay 24/7 eye pencil
in old mine I'm lining my lower lash
line completely with that just to give
it a spark of gold then I'm taking an
eye pencil and from Urban Decay and it's
the color sin and I are nothing I drew
out what color this was but it's a light
brown and I'm putting that on my lower
lash line beneath the gold and then I'm
using my Kat Von D liquid eyeliner and
I'm lining my lash line and I'm trying
my hardest to stay in the frame for you
guys I think I did an okay job who's a
pretty good eyeliner job I do say so
myself I'm just lining my upper lash
line you can add a wing if you want I
didn't feel like you like adding one and
yeah I'm just doing that's gonna give it
some dimension then I'm drilling my
eyelashes and proceeding with my
favorite mascara which is their real by
benefit and just applying as many coats
as that as you'd like when your lashes
and then you are all done with the eye
look
so for lips I am doing a Bobby Brown
orange coral color lipstick it's kind of
like a lipstick and a lip gloss it's
very glossy excuse my gum in my mouth
hey guys can see that but then I'm all
done with the look and I hope you guys
enjoyed it let me know if you guys have
