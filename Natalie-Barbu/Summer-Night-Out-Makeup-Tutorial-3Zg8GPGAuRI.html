makeup tutorial not only have I not from
the video and so long but I haven't done
them to make up tutorial in even longer
so I hope that you guys enjoy this i'm
just going to kind of jump right into it
it is a summer kind of more like you can
wear in the daytime you can wear in the
nighttime it's just great for a summer
night out because not every single night
you need to have a smoky eye so this is
just more for a summer night out it's
perfect all the colors remind me
perfectly of summer and if I ever go to
like a formal event or something I would
probably wear this look if it's like I
mean depends on what I'm wearing but
like just I'm just wearing short shorts
and a tank top right now and I just went
and had like ran errands with my mom and
I think it's perfect and so leave
comments below in other video requests

this makeup tutorial the Lighting's kind
of weird their colors don't show up as
great as they can but still I hope that
you guys can get the idea of it and yeah
just let me know how your summers been
what your plans are for the fall as for
me i am going to college in the fall so
it's a big deal um me yeah just let me
know your plans let me know what how are

video requests I'm going to Disney World
in a few days and I'm going to meet
filming outfit of the days there and
yeah so I'm just going to jump right
into this I hope you guys have an
awesome summer and I will see you guys
later bye
you
ok so to get started I didn't want to
put on concealer on just because in the
summer I don't really need concealer but
I did want to brighten my eyes just in
case those long summer nights we don't
get any sleep so I just did an eye
brightener instead of using concealer
just because I would rather not have my
makeup be too picky and then I put on a
BB cream because again I don't want
anything cakey I just want something
very light as you can tell I don't have
very many blemishes in the summer so all
I want is just a little coverage and it
also has SPF which is good so use the
loot loreal you code um BB cream and
then I like to add bronzer just to kind
of make my face match my skin just
because even in the summer my face still
gets or still doesn't get as tan as my
body so I just like to match it with
that and then after that I'm going to
proceed to use a blush and I am actually
using a hot pink blush but if you just
dab your brush into the blush then it
won't be too strong as you can tell i
don't like very strong blush but i just
wanted to get the hot pink color on my
cheeks and then i'm going to be using a
primer for my eyes just to make sure I
last all day because my eyelids get very
oily in the summer and i'm using this
new sexy Tropez um just tropics whatever
um two-faced I shadow palette gosh I
don't know why that was so hard to say
I'm just using a champagne color on my
lid and on my highlight just to start it
off as a base and then I'm just going to
jump right into the actual like half way
to color it's going to be using the
jargon these are all like cities in
Europe and I don't know then how to
pronounce them so i feel really
uneducated but anyways i'm putting this
orangi coral color on my lid and then
I'm putting that or champagne Orange
my crease but I am blending it out and
you can actually stop here with the
eyeshadow if you wanted to but I wanted
to do a little bit more smokey then i'm
using soleil and I that's the dark brown
color and i'm putting that actually
inside my crease just to darken it up
and again you can stop anywhere you want
for the eyeshadow did it all depends on
how dramatic you want to make it then
i'm going to be using monaco and i'm
going to be using a highlights brush
which this is a bamboo brush and just
putting it on the outer lid and a little
bit on my crease just to make it flow
nicely and again you can stop right here
if you want to I'm just blending it out
and then just to make sure I don't have
any harsh lines going back in with my
first more my second lid color and I'm
just making sure I have it blended and
just kind of making it reappear because
I don't want it to have gone away now
I'm using my Urban Decay 24 7i pencil in
gold mine I am lining my lower lash line
completely with that just to give it a
spark of gold then I'm taking an eye
pencil and from urban decay and it's the
color sin and I are not sin I'm I drew
out what color this was but it's a light
brown and i'm putting that on my lower
lash line beneath the gold and then i'm
using my Kat Von D liquid eyeliner and
I'm lining my lash line and I'm trying
my hardest to stay in the frame for you
guys I think it did an okay job who's a
pretty good eye liner job I do say so
myself I'm just lining my upper lash
line you can add a wing if you want I
didn't really feel like adding one and
yeah I'm just doing that to gonna give
it some dimension then I'm curling my
eyelashes and proceeding with my
favorite mascara which is they're real
by benefit and just applying as many
codes as that as you would like on your
lashes and then you are all done with
the eye look
so for lips I am doing a bob brown
orange coral color lipstick it's kind of
like a lipstick and lip gloss it's very
glossy excuse my gum in my mouth legged
can see that but then I'm all done with
the look and I hope you guys enjoyed it
