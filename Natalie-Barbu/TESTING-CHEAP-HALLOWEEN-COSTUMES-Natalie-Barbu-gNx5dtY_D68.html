this hat feels like arts and crafts like
paper material huh what is this please
don't be this for Halloween I think like
a 8 year old would wear to us Halloween
slumber party hey everyone
it is Natalie here and today I am
filming a Halloween related video I'm
trying to sneak these in like right
before Halloween time because I have
been so beyond busy this October it has
been probably the worst month ever this
semester even though it's my senior year
is so hard but without the excuses I'm
having the two wonderful amazing
youtubers on this video on Halloween
looks so we are all doing totally
different Halloween look videos I will
have them all linked down below and
please like click on their videos up
here because they are so amazing it is
Maddie Ryles she's doing a really really
fun costume idea and then Kyla Laird
which I have filmed or I collabs and
films with her many times before
recently I had a collab with her as well
so go and check out their videos they're
all Halloween related if you guys need
any last-minute ideas or just obsessed

you're coming from their Channel please
be sure to let me know in the comments
down below because I would love to meet
you guys and please be sure to subscribe
without further ado though I am just
gonna go start on this video because I
think it's gonna be really funny and I
honestly cannot wait to try these
outfits and costumes on because they
were so cheap and I've always I've never
ordered a clothes off of Amazon before
that I've never actually ordered clothes
or Halloween costumes so these will be
really funny to try on costumes I'm
gonna be showing you guys is very like
generic in all original costumes I'm
gonna be doing a sexy nurse this is a
you know Halloween time it's time to
make everything a little more sexy so
yeah I'm doing this sexy nurse gonna see
if it looks like the photo there's
probably gonna be like way too big or
way too small or just like
we're gonna see the next one I thought
was hilarious because the outfits
costume is called plumber girl this is
Mario this isn't a plumber plumber girl
Maria whatever so if you want Mario
costume just look up plumber zero like
oh oh I didn't notice the socks
oh girl just the guy I saw up okay the
next one is a sexy waitress there's a
lot of sexy cheap costumes on Amazon I
do not do the whole sexy Halloween
costume I'm excited to try these out
this is like the German feeling
Oktoberfest if you wanna do that this is
kind of what it is the next one is this
beauty in the beasts costume so it is
this beautiful dress with a lot of like
tulle and material and we are gonna see
how this looks because on her it looks
on her honestly it doesn't even look
that great like I can't tell them
aterial or it doesn't look great so like
I wonder how it's actually gonna be in
person it's very yellow from what I can
see yeah and then I have another one
that actually came in a bag so I just
opened it and it was the costume it's
this Batgirl one so it looks like it's
meant for a little kid but we're gonna
see well we'll see how it is then alas
one or least I will be trying a blonde
like platinum silver awake on for you
guys because it was eight dollars and I
feel like wigs are just so much fun and
you guys can see how they look so now I
am going to be trying on it these
Halloween costumes okay so this is the
costume
honestly like not that bad I will say if
you want this nurse costume it's kind of
cute comes with a little that's a scope
so you can hear someone's heartbeat you
know good pick-up line it's ridiculously
short though yeah it's cute it's it's
not a bad material I'm okay with it
got it to me plug my girl plumber girl
outfits definitely giving Mari Mario
vibes
this hat reminds me of Toad like am i
toad with this hat it's like a snapback
but with a very fat top how like who
wears this hat who wears this hat yeah
it's not tight at all like this shirt
it's just like awful um see like I can't
like I can tuck it in but it's still not
gonna be tight and then the tights guys
all right I wish I had a bigger room so
I could show you this all at once but
well it just sucks about this these
tights like oh my god they remind me of
me before you accept rent version it's
like the background of my room behind
the scenes like a giant mess I think
means this hat like who who wears like I
tried putting it on different ways like
this way put it off in a normal way so
this costume um it's not very flattering
it's extremely big and loose on me like
this like I feel like if I like like
it's gonna fall down and I got a size
small the material is really bad um
feels like arts and crafts like paper
material um really just not feeling this
it's like so poofy I wish you guys could
see how poufy it is like this is the
only thing I came with so like didn't
even come with cool accessories or
anything like that I wish Kim looks like
up here to hold and the length of it
it's like I'm not sure at all
what is this first of all would like no
this is so bad this is a towel
this is towel material I'm not kidding
the yellow sleeves feel like my towel
and like a beach like a cheap $2 beach
towel oh I mean it doesn't look like
awful but it's so itchy and it smells
and like this is more like fluorescent
like green like it has a green tint to
it in real life the bottom and it is
like the most ugly tool the silk
underneath kills me but like where's the
doesn't she have like a drawer right
here normally where is that the gloves
first of all don't really fit and I
don't know how you gonna get gloves that
don't say like they're all like umm they
feel like I'm about to like scrub my
shower you know those gloves that you
seem just opt for those because they're
just the same oh let's get a slip the
fingers are too long and I have like
very long fingers but the thumb is too
short so it's very odd not like they
literally choking soda towel on I am NOT
getting this is so funny I mean let's
just talk about the tool at the bottom
now this is itchy you guys don't wear
this it's so itchy if you're trying to
feel like a princess don't buy this
cause I love this I actually do like
this on I feel like I'm a little kid
though I feel like this is something
like a eight year old with where to us
Halloween slumber party but it's
probably the best material it's like a
cotton playing like t-shirt material
it's nice and fitted on me and the
sleeves are just like pretty cool I
think so this one actually is a yes I
really do like this one
I actually really like it go Amazon for
having a one good decent costumer really
cheap and then last but not least I am
trying on the blonde wig so you guys
follow me on snapchat or Instagram you
would have seen me try this on already
but it is funny because your girl does
not have blonde hair and your girl has
really
eyebrows so it'll be fun this is what
cap is awesome I don't want to put your
hair up okay see it didn't even have to
put my hair up in the way cap just got
it all wait I don't like it I gotta let
in just this okay so besides the bangs
I honestly dig this way I know I will
never die my hair this color in my life
but it's not that bad I don't think oh
my god okay maybe it is maybe it's just
um it's just the bangs like girl if I
got a haircut like this I would be me I
would not be getting hair like this
first of all this week was $8 on Amazon
you guys so if you want and I have like
every color on the face of the earth so
if you just want this wig have it links
down below
it's really bad but you know it's fun
for like a photo or something like that
