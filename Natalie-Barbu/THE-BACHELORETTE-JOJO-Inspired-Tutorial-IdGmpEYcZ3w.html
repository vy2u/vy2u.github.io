I am coming to you guys before I filmed
a makeup tutorial because it is a
chitchat makeup tutorial that we're
going to do today so I just want to sit
down talk to you guys film a makeup
video which I just recently posted one
but I haven't actually sat down to talk
to the camera and so long so I'm really
excited guys it's just it's been a while
I miss you I just this is just a nice
thing today I am filming actually a
bachelorette Jojo inspired a makeup
tutorial so if you guys don't watch The
Bachelorette she is the one for this
current season and I have gotten a lot
of comments actually that I look like
her which I don't think I do but I mean
people have told me that so that's why I
wanted to do a makeup tutorial for her I
guess I think it's like the hair is kind
of similar like we both have ombre I
think that's like what is similar about
us anyway I have a very fresh face and
it looks very oily because it's so hot
outside it's like so hot and for all of
my makeup products and just come some
favorites and stuff like that because
like a lot of these products I don't use
on an everyday basis but if you want to
know my favorite products that I use you
can go to my showroom a closet so if you
guys download the app showroom and just
go look me up Natalie Barbie follow me
you guys will be able to see my little
vidi mini video clips on there talking
to you guys it's just about all my
favorite products clothing or beauty
related or just random things it's just
a lot easier for me to put my videos on
there rather than YouTube because I feel
like on YouTube you guys don't want to
see a 20 minute video of my favorite
things those never are my most popular
videos but I still want to like tell you
guys what they are but not take up 20
minutes of your day so that's why I use
a showroom and I just put like my
favorites on they are going to look
before and after picture of how it is
when it looks on like on me and it's
like a makeup product and yeah it's a
awesome app you guys can actually get
paid on it too because like if you make
a video and you put the link of the
product that you're using and someone
clicks on
link and buys the product you actually
get paid so it's an awesome way to make
money and also an awesome way just to
kind of be on ZigBee of influence
alright I will have the link down below
but we are skite started with this Jojo
inspired makeup tutorial the first thing
I'm going to be using is a foundation
and this is actually my little sisters
foundation but I thought that it works
best so it's actually powder and you
applied it with this brush and it's
color science so it's color science in
the color warm tan and it's pressed a
mineral powder so I'm just going to
apply it with this brush and put it all
over my face I don't use primers guys
and just like I don't like them and this
gives an amazing coverage I don't know
how the coverage is so good for being a
powder and using this brush
also make sure that you go down your
neck if you are not using the color that
is exactly your skin tone so that's what
I'm doing is making sure it's like a
little more down my neck so I don't look
scary it's very much a natural beauty I
think so that's why I'm skipping
concealer because I don't really like
concealer that much so I am skipping
concealer underneath my eyes because
we're going to focus more on like the
contouring so that is what I'm doing and
since it's already a powder makeup I
don't apply powder over it because it's
just already powder obviously with face
makeup you can do whatever you want like
it's totally up to you guys I'm just
going to tell you guys what I do and I'm
not make fartist or anything but this is
just how I thought the look looked best
so I'm taking my bronzing got it I
actually have no idea like the thing
that completely came off it's from CVS
it needs Physicians Formula and I'm
taking it with this brush and just going
along my cheekbones
up to your temples just to make it look
more natural and I just looked at a
bunch of her Instagram pictures for
inspiration but I was so like hesitant
to I would quickly looked at them
because I didn't want to read any
comments because I feel like the end of
someone would have commented like oh my
gosh I'm so and so when's the
Bachelorette or whatever like hope that
you and blah blah were happy because
like I knew that he wins and I don't
want to know so if any of you guys know
who wins do not tell me like I will
leave so I will block you if you put in
the column two wins and I know that
sounds very aggressive but it's just
like I watch this for a couple seasons I
haven't seen every season because I
think it started when I was like five
but I've seen a lot of seasons and every
year I look up spoilers because I'm that
girl that needs to know what happens so
I look up spoilers for everything so I
find out every spoiler for every show i
watch and look on purpose um but this is
my first season where I'm not going to
know beforehand and I'm like really
nervous about it so I feel like she
contours a lot that's just why I tried
doing like a lot of bronzer on my
cheekbones like in the hollows of my
cheek you can literally go crazy with
this like I go crazy with bronzer not
even live so just like taking my finger
and putting it along the sides of my
nose
so this Hasse can I went to Sephora and
I actually bought Anasazi as a glow kit
which I'm so excited about it is this
beautiful contouring light it's just a
bunch of like highlighter basically so I
know Jojo has like insane highlighter
going on she always looks so good an
oyster just has a lot of highlight so
I'm gonna add some highlights actually
never used this palette before but I'm
going to take this summer color which is
the lighter one it's like typical
highlight color and I'm going to
without on which he funds
I know I have this much highlighter on
the like I'm obsessed and then I put it
on my nose so I'm going to put it a
little bit my nose I've noticed she
contours her nose a lot such a weird
thing to notice but like I do and since
I feel like I did go a little overboard
with a highlighter not gonna lie I feel
like I did not for me but maybe for her
I'm just going to take my bronzer brush
and just like blend it
okay and then after highlighter I don't
personally I do it my blush that often
but she does so I am taking it my orgasm
blush from NARS which is the hands-down
best blush in the world and smiling and
just putting it on my cheeks
and now for the eyes I'm just going to
take my eyeshadow primer this is from
Smashbox it's 20 for our lid primer it's
a little sample
I like it I call a shadow primer the
same zone so tell me if you guys watch
this season who is your favorite guy my
favorite for me personally is Robbie I
love him I don't even know why I like
him too much I just think he's so hot
he's so cute like he's so nice and
everything like that and I really like
it like he's very much more my type but
I think that she's gonna end up with
Jordan my opinion I just think that she
is now I'm going to be using my naked 2
palette which I love and I am taking the
color and it's called a suspect I'm
taking suspect and I'm going to put that
all over my lid it's a shimmery like
light brown color my initials do it
again right that works that's really up
close and personal but dusting is a
brown color on my lid then i'm taking a
snakebite which is darker Brown and
putting that in the crease
I'm gonna blend it out so that it
doesn't look as dark
I take T's though and blend it out with
T's because that's a matte color and I
feel like we definitely need some matte
in this because it's all sparkly also
tell me guys how your summer husband I
have a job this summer so I just have an
internship actually it is with Ralph
Lauren but it is with their engineering
department so that's pretty cool
I've been enjoying that and enjoying my
summer to really teaching me a lot of
just like how being adult an adult is
gonna be and I'm really scared and
halfway done what college you guys and
I'm just I'm terrified I don't want to
be an adult and we're going to blend it
again with teas
and now we're going to take an eyeshadow
brush again and take booty-call which is
a really funny name for it and it's like
a light shimmery color and just put that
underneath our brow bone actually I'm
going to take the matte one which is
foxy and put that over it just because I
feel like it's a little too shimmery so
put the matte one over the shimmery one
it balances it out more so I am going to
take my black eyeliner just literally
anyone and I'm going to line my upper
lash line with it because I was looking
at her pictures of like her eyes and it
looks like she I like lines up with a
pencil I could be wrong but that's just
what it looks like to me it looks more
smudge than like oh wait
then I'm also going to lower our lower
lash line with this but just to like the
middle not the whole way science abuse
now on to the mascara so I'm taking
better than sex mascara by Too Faced
curling at my eye lashes and he's
putting mascara on
I'm to the last part of my eyes which is
my eyebrows the most important part good
eyebrows definitely so we are just going
to brush them uh I just got my eyebrows
done and I love them they look so good
anything that's how those days are just
like feeling your eyebrows like they are
just on point so this is one of those
days I'm taking a medium brown uh dip
brow from Anastacio I think I should be
dark brown but he's my eyebrows are
super dark but I have medium brown and I
feel like Jojo is has lighter hair than
me so I don't want to make my eyebrows
my focal point because I don't look at
Jojo I'm not like oh my gosh like her
eyebrows are amazing so we're just going
to fill them in with your natural shade
um that's what I would do I feel like
our eyebrows are very similar so I'm
just feeling Mumbai named as a natural
shape but you just want a slight arch
you don't want like too high of an arch
because she just is very like natural
looking eyebrows if that makes any sense
look at the difference guys how do
people not like doing their eyebrows Lee
thank God my mom when I was seven years
old I had a straight up unibrow but my
mom would pluck the middle of my hair
and I always wanted to have my eyebrows
to be thinner like when I was in middle
school and stuff I always wanted to have
my address center actually I had unibrow
coming out of the womb I'm not kidding I
literally had a unibrow coming out of
the womb but anyways so my mom would
never let me make them thin she never
ever let me she's always like thick
brows are so much nicer don't like
listen with people or challenges people
would make fun of me and now I'm just
like thank God mom you knew you knew and
you always have that brow that's like
stuff like this brow is so much better
than this one always it's just always
betters I know they're their sisters not
twins this one's like the ugly
stepsister compared to this one and now
for the lips so I am just going to take
a notice actually I and so opposite of
her she loves wearing pink lips in her
pictures and I never wear a pink lip so
it's like a struggle for me to find this
because I didn't think I had any I
always just wear nude lips so I finally
found some pink lips and I'm just going
to line it with this Mac eye line or a
lip pencil hey and happy it's like the
only pink one I have and then it just
kind of took purple a purple pinkish um
Pro matte gloss so this is if I don't
look and when you're done I just spray
it with my L'Oreal infallible Pro
setting spray just to make it set but
here is the final look and I actually
curled my hair because she always has
her hair curls like this so I just took
a wand and curl the front pieces and
just like a little bit around but
hopefully you guys liked this look let
me know in comments below if you guys
think that I look like her
I don't think like I can see the
semblance but I just you know you just
never think that you look like anyone
like anytime somebody's like that person
looks like you I've never met anyone
that's like oh wow she does like
everyone just kind of always an Isaac
let me know comment below if you guys
think I do
also let me know who you think it's
going to win in this season but please
do not tell me spoilers I'm so scared to
upload this video cuz I'm so scared to
tell a sailor's please don't tell me
spoilers you guys I will be so so so so
so so so upset so oh yeah I cannot
stress that enough but hope you guys
will like this make sure that you guys
