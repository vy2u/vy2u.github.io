I am filming a critique requested video
I am selling my favorite ways to workout
/ workout apps so I'm kind of giving a
review on a bunch of different apps that
I use to workout / programs and just
because after I've dated my fitness
video which got a lot of views it's one
of my most viewed videos a lot of people
were asking me specific questions about
each individual app because I talked
about so many in that video I just kind
of ran by them I didn't actually talk
about them in detail so a lot of people
in the comments were asking me questions
about each individual app and I actually
have a few more that I have tried out to
review for you guys so I thought it was
a perfect time to do a video because I'm
use all of these for at least like six
weeks at a time so I know if they get
results how I felt afterwards how I
looked afterwards so that in right I
want to share with you my honest opinion
if you are new here please be sure to
subscribe like this video and follow me
on all my social medias but without
further ado let's get started so the way
I'm going to break this video down is
I'm going to talk about different apps
and I'm going to rate it based on cost
results ability time and equipment so
that is kind of how I'm category doing
all of these apps and I'm just going to
break down for you guys
the very first app I'm going to be
talking about is became a program so if
you guys are unfamiliar with this this
is the Kayla it's Tina's beach bikini
beach body guide bikini body guide yes
bikini body I it's the BBG and she kind
of blew up because she became pretty
famous on social media she always puts
her before-and-after pictures of clients
that have used her beauty g.length
bikini body and who have seen result and
I think that especially I got picked up
that is how I found her personally just
in social media and also word of mouth
and she is very very popular in the
fitness industry so I want to talk about
that program because I did that for
eight weeks the program is 12 weeks long
but I only did it for 8 weeks but I did
it twice for 8 weeks
so technically I did it for 16 weeks but
I didn't go week one through 12 and went
week one through eight and I did that
twice just because whenever I stopped
and took a break
I've never I'm one of those people that
like I need to stick to it and if I
don't I feel like I have to restart so I
agree started once more my mom is
actually I think on week 25 so she has
seen so many results and she loves it my
mom was very skeptical also of the BBG
because she thought it was so expensive
in a very simple move but it really
ended up working and that's actually the
only thing that has really transformed
my mom's body the first thing I want to
talk about is be cost I do believe it is
$70 to the e-book so that is just to get
PDF of it and you can put on your phone
even on your laptop but it's just like a
PDF it's just an e-book so that I think
it's $70 it is very very excessive I
don't want you guys to take that $70 a
little bit of money for me that is very
very expensive especially for a workout
program and there are free ones out
there the other thing that we have is
the app and I think that's $20 a month I
personally don't have the app I did the
ebooks but my mom had the app and she
said making this $20 a month and I don't
think that it was got the e-book you
still have to get the app you can't just
get that because go up ebook because
that is the negative side back the app
also had heat add workouts to it she has
challenges more of a community so that's
why you're also paying additional 2000 a
month essential for $70 flat fee and it
also goes week 1 through 12 is the first
BBG in the two second one which is week
12 to 24 so it's 12 weeks at a time it's
absolutely incredible
the next my almond store records results
for that that is the one that Ison the
most results in I started with that
because my fitness stories want to be
kind of my fitness journey watch my
other videos down below I kind of talked
about it but that is the one where I saw
the most results because I started off
from having no muscle to having a very
lean and toned body and I was very happy
with my results of kind of up with a
night-and-day transformation even though
I didn't lose weight because I wasn't
trying to lose weight I want to get
toned and be fit that one's definitely
the job for me my before and afters are
really actually like I think they were a
lot for me just because I never had a
lean toned body that I always wanted and
through that program I did your ability
to do it so unless the ability because I
know a lot of you are kind of like I am
NOT
today at all I don't know if I can
actually even handle it or I mean start
it or I need to start something easier
it is hard but it is doable so you just
have to do it seven minutes at a time so
it's for around seven minutes and so you
just do the most you can in your seven
minutes even if you are in here ten
minutes and do three push-ups over time
you will get better so I think that
anyone can really do it because it is
adjusted to you it's not like she says
you have to do 30 squats and 30 in it
it's like you do 15th 1215 this and
whatever but like it's all in seven
minutes so like it's basically do
whatever you can in seven minutes if
that makes sense
I think that it's actually anyone can do
it it is definitely difficult don't feel
- you're out of breath after the first
two minutes because I definitely was but
yes it is hard but it is definitely
doable for anyone and you will get
better as we go on the next one
it's time this one again like I said
it's for interval of seven minutes and
you get a women to break in between each
one switch about 30 minutes 30 to 32
minutes including the break but 30
minutes a day three times a week she
just legs arms and then as technically
and it's like Monday Wednesday Friday
that's her schedule and then Tuesday
Thursday goes are supposed to work out
for about 30 to 45 minutes just like run
or fast walk or do anything else so
that's why I do say it is five times a
week because you maximize your results
you do need to do it five times a week
even though her specific workouts are
only designed for three times she's
assuming you're doing two times a week
of something else equipment so for
equipment for this is just you do these
weights and you're going to do the bench
and you're going to medicine ball and I
believe that that sometimes she goes
jump rope well you don't really need to
jump rope you just kind of pretend so I
think the basis that you need is a bench
a lot and wait I do it at my gym because
they have all of that which is a type to
look at apartment or a house typically
doesn't have all that equipment but in
do it as a gym you don't need to take up
that much room and I think that it's
very manageable now when I tap that I
want to talk about is the ninety
training club so this is the one I'm
currently using right now and I love
it's the cost of that returning club
it's absolutely free there's no in-app
purchases is a hundred percent free
which i think is amazing it's also very
very clean thing to look at it's not
like a complicated app it's very
straightforward it's very clean which is
what I like and asks very like nice
aesthetically pleasing to look at and it
has over 300 workouts built into the app
you can also choose plan so I am doing
lean fit program for these second times
and I absolutely love it
the result I paid from this is and
definitely more toned I've definitely
kept in shape I didn't know if it would
have given me the biggest transformation
before and after like the kala one said
maybe it was maybe because I started
when I was already kind of more fit I
haven't I seen myself getting more toned
but not like as dramatic of a
transformation but I think that's
obvious just because renowned kind of
like it's not going to be as dramatic
anymore but just because I am at a good
point already if that makes any sense
but I do think that this is a free app
it's worth a shot trying out so I think
that you should do it because you will
see results for sure like I've
definitely gotten more apps doing and I
my arms are way more toned with my legs
has muscle on them so it definitely is a
good app to use and a you will see
results so for the ability this is great
because it has a balance like it has
ranges for all types so if you want easy
intermediate or difficult you can choose
so if you want to take kind of like an
easier day there's after that or there's
a workout for that so if you want a hard
or hard workout like there's more house
for that so I think that's great about
that app it really is for every single
person like you have no excuse to use it
I think it for every single person and
again everything is in like 30 seconds
you know 30 seconds from from mountain
climbers 30 seconds will push up so like
you don't need to do a certain amount
you can only do 10 mountain climbers in
30 seconds like that's fine because
that'd be your ability so it's based on
time not really like not many reps I
guess is everything that I think is the
time again this is a flexible thing so
it has also two workouts you can workout
for only 10 minutes you can work out for
an hour so it has workouts of all for
the time if you follow a plan and
actually ask you in the beginning how
many times a week do you want to workout
and how many
or we see work out so you only want to
work out once a week like you can
definitely do that on there there is an
option you want to work up seven times a
week which personally I don't recommend
and get on with me the rest day but if
you want to work out seven days a week
there is an option for that you know if
you longer work out so it's very very
easy and flexible it makes a schedule
for you but you can move it around to
edit schedule you can move around your
schedule
you can delete workouts because add them
could add your own workout and you can
incorporate writing it asks you if you
want to incorporate running into it so
that I think is awesome for equipment it
also asks you what equipment you have so
we don't have any equipment unit no
equipment it'll never get you overhead
with equipment if you have a lot of
equipment you just select all of it they
literally give you like a big picture
with a bunch of equipment and you select
what you have access to and then from
there it will do your workouts for you I
love it I have you doesn't do repeat
workouts but it's not back-to-back so it
might be like once a week you want to
work out maybe the next time you is the
next week or like so two weeks after
that so there's so many workout that
they can definitely make it flexible and
you don't ever repeat it in menges
boring it's very hard I honestly I put
so much been doing it and I think it's a
great great workout so it's on a set
free is nothing to lose by downloading
apps then I want to talk about its work
it the cost of shorter is absolutely
free again so again you have nothing to
lose when doing this
I heard results I didn't stick with it
and not to see results I kind of
actually know if this ticket was it for
a few like a month and just do it forget
and running so I did forget and then
look living on a treadmill but police
work it was a little easier than what I
wanted but I could answer that I always
said 15-minute ABS you know and like it
kind of got repetitive that's the only
thing with that so I person seal it
before and after pictures I didn't take
foreign actors but if you want a quick
workout harden in a certain body point
it's definitely good like you will see
result if you keep a tight if you do it
for a longer period of time but for me I
just don't think I did it
long enough to see it lots of results
the ability again this is super easy you
can do it if you have no muscle at all
it says very basic moves and again you
can make it however you want because it
is
timed in Irbil so you don't really have
anything to lose everything is based on
your own ability after time this one's
nice because you can do it anywhere in
five minutes to an hour so if you only
want a quick five-minute ab workout
there is option for that and it will do
it for that so I think that's the best
part let's work it is that you can live
as you increments 5 and however one you
have you can do you can also targets
intimate body points so that slips work
it mainly for if you want arms legs but
add anything or you can do a full body
workout so it does have a lot a lot of
like flexibility with it which i think
is really really great to launch other
programs are kind of oculus Kailas
program is 30 minutes long like you
can't do it for 5 minutes you have to do
it for 30 minutes after equipments work
it uses absolutely no equipment except
your body so that is something that's
really nice about it market is great I
think for vacation or if you're just
like on your like in your room before
you go to bed you want to do a quick out
workout and in fact let's work it's
great for it so firstly I would forget
as addition to my workouts not as my
only workout the next thing I wanna talk
about is Blogilates so Blahniks one
after she is a person on youtube a
content creator on YouTube who is known
for her work out she does calendars
they're totally free the new calendar
she told you exactly what videos to
follow that day that is what I did
freshman year and it definitely kicked
my butt I met her at the finish the
workouts and half the time I couldn't do
all the video shoes asking me to do
because it was so long but that was kind
of a good thing because it was so many
videos you can kind of choose if there's
four videos no long do three that's fine
too but again since it is on YouTube is
absolutely free after the results I
definitely do think that you will see
more gold if you stick with it there's
no way you can't because she makes me
sweat a lot and the workouts are so hard
and she's also like it's kind of fun
walking distance is a happy person and
she's so cute and like you just like
want to be her friend and she's talked
to you looking at you to where like I
mean if you're watching this video you
probably like youtubers so you would
doesn't let her videos effort ability
you can and you don't really need much
ability except summer workouts as it
could not do with some her at work
like I physically could not do it I had
to sell that is something about that
like obviously the more you do them the
more you'll get better at it but in the
beginning if you can't do a certain move
because you're just not strong enough
yet that's okay you're going to get
there to the best you can so for ability
for that some of her moves that she
actually does like I physically couldn't
do in the beginning after time again
it's just a little video so some of her
videos are 20 minutes some of them are
only five but her calendar that she does
on her website it tells you how many
videos to do like that's pretty other
say with specific ones they just have to
look up so is that you can make some
mattress you can only want to do with
small videos you don't need to follow
the calendar if you don't want to
equipment sound her videos you use
equipment but not really much you don't
really need RAM if anything you want
going to need a bands in a couple weeks
but it's not like you need a bench and
you don't have any equipment most of our
videos are absolutely no equipment
whatsoever but the occasional ones that
have weight you could just grab a
textbook and do it so perfect videos are
great because you can do them in the
dorm room in my door like I literally
did that on my dorm in a tiny tiny
climbing dorm room like on the floor and
I saw results so definitely you don't
get equipment and I won't talk about
with the Jillian Michaels app so that is
the one I did before the ninety training
one and I really really did love it some
of her workouts were a little weird but
I've never seen any of them before but
they were actually effective and they
made me sweat her girls are 28 minutes
long about only 28 minutes long and it's
three dollars a month for that so is
that one you'd call plenty but not much
as like the Kayla program or anything
like that you can unsubscribe anytime
it's not a contract or anything like
that our result I definitely did get
more toned my abs we're definitely more
decide I definitely probably have an
answer definitely I did see results I
don't have a specific before-and-afters
but I do know that I father's old and I
maintained a way more toned figure we're
ability and you definitely don't need to
be fit super fit again everything is
time to so be doing what you can
time throughout the weeks you will get
better if you keep at it
four times like I said they're only 20
minutes long and but the bad thing about
that is six times a week
I personally in being a college student
and your YouTube videos I don't have
times works it works out six times a
week so I never take six times a week
I've always been about four times a week
so four or five times a week if I could
so that is the only problem with that
that it does like to make em next much a
result respond Student Success a week it
is only 28 minutes let's month my mom
but still being realistic I could do six
times a week after equipment you will
need weights and I believe that's all I
use maybe a medicine ball but wait to
speak basically the only thing that I
ever used for that which I love I love
working with wake you so I purposely do
workouts and incorporate weights because
I don't like to do by the way I like
having actually weights to lift up and
stuff like that and those are the apps
that I was going to cover today because
go to the outside person try if you have
any more that you guys power any other
programs as you need to be an app on
