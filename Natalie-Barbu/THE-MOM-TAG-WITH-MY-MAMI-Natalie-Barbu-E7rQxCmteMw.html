say I am filming my mom tag with my mom
and I on my vlog Channel so for those of
you that don't know I am basically daily
blogging so please go check out my vlog
channel and subscribe to that but on
there I was saying how I had no idea
what videos to film and I didn't know
what to do because we have so much free
time this summer to film but I had no
ideas of what to film and so I suggested
the bomb tag or a family tag so what
we're going to do I asked a lot of you
guys on snapchat and Twitter to ask me
questions for my mom and I got actually
a lot of responses some of them are
pretty repetitive though so I'm going to
do kind of the questions that I like on
the real mob tag that other youtubers
have done and then I'm going to ask
questions that you guys ask at the end
so stay tuned for that if you're not
following me on social media do that the
you guys can keep up with all of this
stuff and participate in the next one
okay I'm going to start first with the
montage so basically just consider the
question okay know what was I like as a
child
Natalie was very quiet and very good
child and she's just like to put a lot
and to play by herself and depend a lot
I always play Barbies that was like my
like they would always reward me with
Barbies I had so many parties I remember
one time you guys didn't want me going
to Honduras and you told me that if I
didn't go you buying a party and I said
yeah you see bribe what do you think of
me making YouTube videos what did I
think or what do I think but I mean if
it works I think you have to follow what
you like if it's not if it's not bad and
I'm fine and I think natalie has done
well and she's happy doing it so
unhappy good have you learned anything
about makeup and beauty from me
I try to try what something I did that
was funny when I was younger you can
edit
yeah when she's not the funny type ago
and I have bad memory so makes a bad
combination if you had to rename me what
was your name
probably Nicole yeah I was at the end of
thinking yeah I think she could have
been any cold I like that name cool when
we go out to eat boys I guess you get
Natalie get something from everyone but
she gets her whatever she wants to order
and then she takes from everyone else
yeah no I think you shorted this you
should is the whole place where would
you like to see me in 10 years
Toby 31 I would like to see Natalie
close to us I want to move to either New
York or LA which is not Western North
Carolina and they are so far yeah but I
always tell Natalie do you want free
free babysitting and you have to stay
close I'd like to see her energy
wherever got most her that's where I
want to see her but obviously the
selfish part of me is like be close to
us live till 5:00 Hey Wow 30 wine maybe
but when I was 24 probably not okay
what is one thing you wish that I was do
I know you're nothing
yes
yes the power not only her room the
house is a complete mess no there's none
of these things are everywhere and I'm
going just create the laundry is full of
things the laundry room is full and I
keep washing things her room is a mess a
dining room has coke comes out of the
table it's just a complete mess now
we're going to go maybe I'll go back to
the mom ones but I only picked a couple
out doesn't look like the best
now we are going I'm just screenshotting
all of your guys and snapchat and the
questions you guys asked me and now
we're going to read them your mom is so
pretty like you do you have any House
Rules is your mom strict and how old is
your mom I mean we do not have we're
nuts I don't think we're strict parents
yeah but you know you're like middle
strict they're not not shirts but
they're not super strict yeah it's not
like I let we let them do whatever they
want but they were right note with us
telling them what's expected from them
yes like so we just feel like hang out I
realize they're some of my friends that
like could never go out and never hang
out whatever but for us like we still
can
but sometimes they're stretched on like
weird things like sleepovers
yeah we don't love sleepovers so what
you want to happen I know but I would
have like begi but right now is over
mm-hmm yes and we're not straight like
in for food for example oh yeah we all
we're always kind of laughs a family
that won't let their cake it's such and
such like no sugar no cookies no yes so
yeah like they could have Natalie could
have you know cookies any time or soda
whenever we had which we don't have
usually but if it's there they any buddy
can drink it yeah so no no no not a lot
of rules
yeah Emma fixation yes yeah we were
never like
killed back really by anything that much
what is the funniest moment you both
have had together we're both so funny
we're not avoiding people what's your
favorite memory together about funny
memory which is memory
I guess family vacations and like my mom
look on vacation together I like to come
here one year ago with mimics Tia yeah
sister indications which is why we
should go to California again so she had
a skin care routine tips because a flash
chip because she is beautiful oh thank
you but the only thing is I don't go to
bed with makeup on sometimes I say I'm
so tired I'm just not going to take it
off today I don't care and then I can't
so just yeah I end up you know spending
five minutes taking it off and putting
some night cream but I don't have any
specific miracle regimen yeah it's just
you know I might put the products I use
are drugstore products so nothing
nothing complicated and she's Hispanic
by the way I would Senate race oh
there's one thing country yes
country scrub and sunscreen since I was
probably like 18 I started slumming
often like exfoliating my face like I
think I can exfoliate my face every day
I know it's not recommended but my my
skin can take it and some sunscreen
before the make up another Maliki
Spanish I love you Natalie
love you too and yet she's from Honduras
yes
so to speak Spanish do you want to say
something in Spanish see mom say
something I have Spanish viewers you say
something no you say something or
Lancome with science is various
messaging
Emma oh yeah I heard this is funny
that's the funny thing yes and Natalie
does not have a middle name she's the
only one that doesn't matter why did I
get
my older sister and my younger sibling -
I was the only like I'm in the middle
and I thought - man at me I hope that
they Natalie so much as I said I should
nominate a middle and then when she was
like I don't know maybe like four she
said what's my middle name and and I
said well you can choose your middle
name
what am I don't name do you want to have
I said I want to be Emma and so she's
not only am I you know and there's a lot
of things that you know you're you have
basic go
you have Emma yeah no I like if you like
what my middle name is I'm like Natalie
Emma but like I have to put it on a
legal document and legally she doesn't
have yeah but if you know but in a day
to day life
yeah Maryam over but like on my backpack
in elementary school it might nip
initials on it like I just like put that
on my backpack down if you don't could
go to any concert together whose concert
would it be well we don't listen to the
stream you probably would go just swing
big - Taylor sleep oh yes Taylor gonna
be my mom likes to pamper your mom
speaks Spanish with you
so she kind of like speak to me in
Spanish and then I respond in English
and that's kind of always how it's been
I wish that I expand faster so I can be
better at it but quite half of the time
I do yeah yeah I speak to that mental
chorus in Spanish but yeah they all
answer back in English how was it like
to have foreign parents did she teach
you any fanon love me from Argentina
very cool in here from there love you
too and I've been to Argentina many
times oh yeah my mom used to travel a
lot for her job that she had
yeah and I love when a side is beautiful
places beautiful people
yes she knows a safe travel all over Lee
with both my parents have but you have
mainly in South America right yes my dad
did Europe more and then he did South
America more boring parents um people
when I was growing up in Florida it
wasn't that different to have parents
come from a different country because a
long ago South Florida where South
American so like all my best friends I
had Antonella
McQueen Tina and both of them were from
different country you know like so
wasn't that weird and it's still not
weird but now
when I'm like in North Carolina
especially people are like oh my gosh
it's so cool like they think it's really
cool it's nice stuff like I get lessons
from them that like you wouldn't get
from people that have lived here their
whole lives like my dad lived in Romania
for 18 17 years
yeah and it was communist so he had to
go away like escape communism so that I
mean that crazy does that was my dad and
not a great grandpa you know so things
like that that's really cool and it just
sees things Vidya we have like another
perspective and yeah on life yeah I mean
like we have lives in other countries
you know we're rice in other countries
yes so how my parents have never been
outside of the US you know so they'd
look never eat this they don't even know
what it's like being in another country
and like the countries are from or not
glamorous places either
so I feel like that's a good perspective
of how is I and high schools or school
in general elementary school do you know
Natalie was just a normal child nothing
you know playing with her Barbies
reading a lot of books reading reading
reading she would read every day yeah I
read so many books with my cousins and
you all wanted me yeah I wanted to be an
author writer yeah which is so weird
that now I'm in engineering because
normally when people like reading and
writing they take back but as I went to
high school I didn't like writing
anymore um I feel like reading and I
still love breathing but I like reading
books I choose not ones that the school
assigns for me even though most of us
have been good on a clean I haven't read
them I go to school but anyways yeah
everyone know me is someone with a book
in my hand emily was always reading and
playing my Barbies always and she had a
the NCL tree oh yeah great at the MCA
all times which was Natalie Chloe and
Lucas with her my younger sibling and
then he would all film and report they
would did the weather we did the forget
sweet it was on camera so
and that's right now while you were like
nine right and when you started yeah
nine ten I was in fifth grade and I
remember dragging my little kid likes to
film and see all times and we have
Agassiz song since the MCL we were
sitting on Ian's yeah and I would sew
with my family and we would just do it
on like photobooth basically on that Mac
computers like the last of the I think
we had a laptop because I definitely did
it in the bathroom and that's what yeah
we would do that would do the weather we
would dress up our always perform skits
like I always want to be in front the
camera and I even tried acting for a
while
yes we went to LA for acting too and I
really like that oughta sing sing if I
put myself back into it I would like it
again but I'm like so far I haven't like
touched acting and so along that there
was one lady I'd wanna go yeah if you
like me what it's a convention yes yes
she said that if she could if we could
move therefore I Lila Indiana Michelle
she would put her in something that she
had in mind but we're we're not ready to
move the family and you know just yes
what's renata me but what they don't
think it was the right time
