today I am filming another college type
video this one is a little different
than the other ones because the other
ones are more technical videos and
they're more focused on like majors and
how to choose your college and stuff
like that I've been doing a whole series
on that so if you guys want to see that
I will have all of those videos linked
down below but today we are actually
going to be talking just about kind of
like college in general what to expect
basically everything you need to know
about once you are there and what to do
which way - I have a lot of viewers that
are heading there next year or maybe you
just want to reminisce all those little
days or you're like 8th grade and you
just want to watch college videos
because why not
speaking of comment down below how old
you are and where you're from like its
what country you're from or like what
city you're from I would really love to
know like where i viewers are coming
from I think that'd be so cool and how
old you guys are so yeah comment down
below if you guys are new here at hello
please subscribe if you'd like in those
videos every Tuesdays and Fridays so
happy Tuesday you guys so the worst
thing I'm going to talk about is a
living situation because a lot of people
when they go to college they move away
from their hometown they go into a brand
new city up brand new place and they
basically the first thing that people do
like freshman year it's very difficult
to live in a dorm I lived in Indore my
freshman year dorms no matter what
though they're nice if they're not nice
I feel like people still have these same
issues and like a lot of people have
roommate issues a lot of people don't
know how to pick a roommate so
personally for me I found my roommate on
Facebook um we just there's a page for
NC State like class of whatever and then
you just type in that everyone there is
like hey I'm looking for a roommate I'm
a really campaigning around fighting my
frogs that scare us going out and we
find that literally every single person
post like I'm not kidding that's how I
found my roommate I just messaged her
she messaged me and then we connected
and yeah that's how that happened but a
lot of people do do random roommates or
a lot of people look at room with their
friends from high school or like I did
through Facebook but no matter what you
do most people I now have had roommate
issues luckily and me and my roommate
was together for three years and
so we didn't really have big issues we
just have little ones but it wasn't like
big huge issues but a lot of people I
know and actually most people I know
ended up like hating member mates
the reason why most people end up
fighting with a roommate or hating
number mate or just having issues with
them is because of lack of communication
lack of confrontation and also just
selfishness I feel like it kind of boils
down to that so what I've noticed is
that when you to be a good roommate to
basically need to clean up your mess
that is the number one things I remember
I would get so annoyed if I came home
and like living in an apartment in the
kitchen was a mess or something and I
just do it you know or like living in
the dorm it's like you comment in back
to your room and like literally your
roommates stuff is everywhere that will
get you pissed off so 300 roommate make
sure that you clean up your mess even if
you're not a clean person try to be
because you're living with someone else
another thing that people would get mad
at for roommates is when they didn't ask
to do something and I'm talking about
like if you're bringing a bunch of
friends over and you had to share in a
room and you literally don't tell your
roommate at all that like hey I'm not
have three friends spend the night but
that's just kind of common sense just to
ask like because you are not the only
one living there so you're not the only
one being affected by it it is a little
different when you have your own room
and you just share an apartment I never
really asked if I had anyone coming over
because it was just like they're going
to be in my room you're not even going
to see them at all but what you do have
a dorm you need to talk about those
things and that kind of boils down to
selfishness also like the cleaning and
asking like don't borrow your roommates
stuff you didn't ask that's also a huge
thing I know so many people would like
steal clothes from their roommate
because one time they let me borrow a
shirt so I guess it's a free-for-all now
their closet like no don't do bad and
the next thing I want to talk about is
Greek life and a lot of you if you are
not from the US are not familiar with
Greek life so I'm pretty sure the u.s.
is the only place that does this maybe
I'm wrong but it's where sororities in
fraternities like that's what Greek life
is Panhellenic and inner what is it I
don't know I don't know what the other
one is I was in a sorority for one year
or no whoa other than throwing for two
years I was being feted taught alpha at
NC State and I have a video on that also
but I was not for two years and then I
dropped my junior year
for my junior year at all wait while I
love my dog stop arguing
but basically Greek life is where girls
and guys will rush or go through
recruitment the recruitment process and
then they go and they find their home
away from home that's like what people
say it's like your home well I'm saying
this all in air quotes I don't have
anything against Greek life I just think
some of the things that they do are kind
of funny I was in it for two years so
like I know the goods and the pros and
the cons of it and I'm not saying that
it's all bad or it's all good or
anything like that but I'm here to talk
to you guys about it my number one
advice though for someone is that if you
are interested at all in rushing and you
are interested at all and joining a
sorority or joining a fraternity and you
really really want to or like even if
you don't really want to but you're like
maybe I do go through the recruitment
process because it doesn't hurt if you
think this area's a small fee to go
through recruitment or small price but
like it is worth it to see if you want
to because nothing is worse than
regretting it and then being like I wish
I did so I went 100% go to the
recruitment process if you have a desire
to if you literally know that you will
never want to be in a strong or
paternity don't go through that process
because you know already but if you have
any small inkling in your heart to do
that then I would highly recommend doing
it because who knows you might just love
it I rush and I kind of knew that I
wanted to be in one certain sorority
since the beginning because I knew
people in it and a lot of people say go
in there with an open mind like don't
listen to what other people are saying
and I have like yes and no to that
because yes don't go into what other
people are saying because everyone is
different you might like one with them
you your friends like one you know but
if you already have a ton of friends in
one sorority chances are you're going to
mesh well with that once already because
you already like half the girls in it
versus if you go into it through
recruitment with an open mind Rick Rubin
and girls are a lot more fakes during
recruitment and it's not necessarily a
bad fake like oh they're saying that I'm
pretty when really they're talking about
with my hand my back and talk about how
ugly I am it's not that type of fake
remain like oh I love your shirt and
then they're like I was the ugliest
shirt I've ever seen no but I think as
then we're forced to smile you're forced
to sing songs you're forced to act like
oh my gosh hi
to meet you you know like everything is
very kind of like like oh I might have
to be on my best and like right before
the doors open everyone's like oh my
gosh and then the doors are open and
you're like oh my gosh hi welcome you
know so it's just like that kind of fake
where you have to kind of know that
that's not really how they're like I'm
saying this like I don't want anyone to
hate me like if they're watching this
and they're in Greek life where they're
in my sorority or something like that
like it's just it's true I mean I don't
know how anyone can argue about it like
no one is that happy in her life like
your friends and one like you're
obviously going to want to go to that
one it's kind of like going in with an
open mind but also if you know things
about other sororities and don't like
completely forget about that and our
girls means you hate whatever those
types of questions I personally would
never one-page I'm not just saying this
on camera I literally was never even one
paid for like a second so for me
personally I wasn't I know girls that
were though not in my sorority but I
know girls in general like at other
schools and at other places that were
K's and then for fraternities obviously
I'm not a boy so I'm not an attorney but
my boyfriend is in line and I have all
my friends all my guy friends there and
fraternities I do think their bond it's
a lot closer than the girls because it's
girls you have like 50 girls in a pledge
class and there's no way you're going to
know all them there's no way you're
going to be friends with all of them so
it's just kind of hard to judge it
because guys return days are usually a
lot smaller and they honestly bond so
much more than the sororities do that is
kind of about three slides that I want
to share with you guys that's like I'm
going to talk about frat parties also
but that's like the main thing about
Greek life it's just like an
organization where girls can like bond
together and your sisters and all this
stuff and the recent Ross was just
because I wasn't getting what I'm paying
for
stories are expensive I was paying it
for it myself and I literally didn't
hang out with any of the girls in it and
I never went to the house I'm like
barely eight they're like it just like
wasn't worth for me I never lived in the
house and go supply my paying this money
if I literally don't do anything with it
the next thing I want to talk about is
parties that is like the number one
thing people want to know about college
when they're talking with the social
life of it because literally when
anytime college is portrayed in a movie
it's just like in a frat house just Red
Solo cups everywhere like people like
yeah like so drunk whatever is that real
life is it
whatever and also with parties I want to
talk about the hook-up culture because
that kind of works and goes hand in hand
for college so for parties um freshman
year I think frat parties is where
everyone goes so freshman year is like
the number one primetime for frat
parties frat party or fraternities do
like a lot of events during the
beginning of the year and they try to
like recruit guys to their fraternity
and then also a lot of girls go to
return these and typically the house is
filled with freshmen girls my number one
advice for opportunity parties is don't
be like don't think that you're weird if
you don't like them I personally hate to
pretend to be parties like I will never
step foot in another one unless I know a
bunch of people there because I have fun
because I like know all the guys in it
but like if I'm just going to a random
frat party just like with my girlfriends
no I mean I think this is just all a
place where a lot of people are like
trying to act like they're having fun
but they're really not and much less
their phone out and it's like
snapchatting the whole thing and it's
like really are you even like enjoying
yourself be safe also I don't know guys
that roofie girls personally I know it
happens and I know sexual assault is
such a huge thing on campus so it's a
real thing it's not just like a made up
statistic like girls will get sexually
assaulted in college be careful don't
ever leave your drink unattended don't
leave like if your Kamath friend leave
with that friend make sure that you know
where they are all times on just be safe
don't ever go anywhere by yourself don't
trust a guy the first thing you met him
at a party um you know things like that
which is just saying I don't know any
guys that are that malicious enough to
do something like that but I know that
they are out there so just please be
careful is the number one thing I have
to say and with hookup culture that goes
hand in hand with that parties is the
number one place where like hookup
culture I guess happens before you meet
guys that you hook up with I don't know
I know you normally don't meet up hook
up with a guy from class and hook up
with guy that you've met at a party you
know that's like what happens and for me
I honestly don't like the hook-up
culture I don't participate in it at all
but if you do um also know if you're the
type of person that gets attached hookup
culture I don't think is for you because
a lot of guys in college especially
freshman year I don't recommend anyone
dating freshman year that's like one
think because freshman boys are so
mature and I think that's a good time to
kind of like find yourself and stuff and
I had a boyfriend freshman year and I
honestly like I see why people shouldn't
date freshmen here that means that guys
literally don't care about you if all
they're using you is to hook up with
like it's all yours down for us to hook
up with then that's fine like you're
okay with that but if you're the type of
person I guess attached you don't expect
to change the guy because it's just not
going to happen especially freshman year
but it's not going to happen
so I just think seriously be careful
young girls like getting their hearts
broken because I know so many girls kind
of want to like thanks guys and change
them and make them better but like
that's just not going to happen in
college and wherever you should never
want to change someone you should like
accept them for who they are and if you
don't they're not a project just move on
they're not for you I think that's like
the number one thing I have to say is
that if you get attached easily don't
participate in it because your heart
will break and you will be so sad
because there you're going to be
wondering why don't they like me they
told me that they did and then we hooked
up like that's probably why they're
telling you being honest and I say I
want to talk about is friends it's
College and I'm just going to leave this
brief I feel like this video I'm just
kind of like glazing over everything but
yeah it's still 20 minutes long how I
don't know friends I think that
something that's kind of shocking for
people is that it's totally fine to be
lonely I had more friends in high school
than I did in college and I think that's
because in college
friendships are more shallow just
because you just met the person and so
think about high school friends
typically for high schoolers like you've
known that person since middle school or
you've known that person since
kindergarten even if you didn't weren't
friends you've still known them for a
while like you've known who they are for
a while versus college everyone can be
thrown into this one place and everyone
wants to make friends with everyone
because everyone's new it's like every
single person is the new kid freshman
year at least and so everyone's are
trying to make friends everyone with the
second you have one thing in common with
someone you stick to them or you stick
to your roommate or whatever and you
just have a label we're best friends
we're friends were going to go out there
they're going to eat too
we're going to do everything together
and you see a ton of groups of people
that are like that and like after the
first week like there's a groups of
people in the dining hall eating
together every day and you're like how
did they make friends so quickly like I
feel so lonely it's so normal some
people are just more extroverted some
people make friends easier than others
and some people honestly it's fine if
you don't have good if you don't have a
lot of friends but it's better to have a
few good ones than a lot of bad ones or
just a lot up and friends and I feel
like that's why call it trenches are
more shallow because you don't know the
person and I thought I like and I'm not
like a person that gets close to people
that easily so that's why I don't have
that many friends in college not like oh
I don't have any friends but I had a
bigger friend group in high school than
I did in college because in high school
I had like years to develop that
friendship for just college I just met
you we're not best friends like I
literally met you last week that is
basically all I have to say about that I
know this video was like very like just
touched on everything so if you guys
want a more expanded thing of any of
these topics let me know I hope you guys
enjoy this video and please subscribe if
you liked it and I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
