everyone I am starting this video off a
log style and I'm with Ali and we are
going to some dirt shorts I can talk to
some thrift stores and the first stop is
goodwill so the good was right behind us
but we are doing a thrift with me video
so this is a collab with Ali right here

all North Carolina girls too so I am
about to go into Goodwill and start
shopping for or try to find some thrift
Danish things because I am a big like I
really really like finding good like
cheap thrift store items but I'm so bad
at it so we're gonna see how if I'm good
at it this time or something I don't
know we're about to go walk into
Goodwill though she's wondering gucci
belt like it really hope you guys
enjoyed this video make sure to leave a
comment below if you came from either of
their channels and go and show them some
love on their channels comment on their
video and give this video a thumbs up
and let's just get started
they deliver why
yeah Ali just found a pair of sevens and
I'm really jealous I just found myself a
pair of sevens I literally found like
seven sevens in here there's so many who
is giving these all away all of these
black t-shirts this is this is my closet
his name is Lilith Karen Scott which if
anyone watches One Tree Hill that really
reminds me of it okay this it looks very
weird but I'm thinking of it like tied
up like a crop top it could work I don't
know I'm just gonna pick it up to see
this could be cute it just imagine if
this was that like Urban Outfitters this
would be like $80 I'm not kidding I'm
just gonna try it on colorful cute this
is so cute and it still has the tags on
and everything it was $66 oh my gosh and
it's a duster this is so cute you guys
oh my gosh we're in the dressing room
now this is my outfit that I came here
with by the way if anyone was not very
we're gonna try on all of our stuff this
is the Italia jacket it's a little big I
think this would be so cute and sporty
if it was like of the upsize or
something but it's just like so large I
did I like it but I know like the second
I step out of here
I'm not gonna like it as much just
because it's a little too oversize so
this is I give it a 5 out of 10 because
it's not my size but if it was my size
yeah this shirt this is how I imagined
it like if it was like a crop shirt this
is it for like a luau or something like
that like a themed Hawaiian party but
it's not themed I just feel like an
idiot so I don't just don't recommend
maybe if I like cut it but if I cut it
ya know my company become IQ and I'm so
pale yeah if I cut this and did you tie
it I think it would be a cute shirt so
I'm gonna think this is the dress first
hmmm
it's really actually cute I didn't know
how it would fit obviously at hammer-on
so the shops in the back but it's like a
nice warm fitting dress it's like up
where's the length I was thinking of
tying yet
yeah I'm ruined yeah yeah so this is
thank you I really really like this this
will hmm still have to tag along and
everything nice
tiny dress this member like you said she
was like a jacket army so let me try it
with the Duster
yeah what's duster I hate love I love it
oh my gosh that I have on or they are
names whatsoever they barely fit over my
butt and look at how motorized these are
you guys like the pockets or so I'm so
good 90 these are men the low-rise jeans
friggin fashion and I saw a tweet that's
like um I saw someone's low-rise jeans
today and it scares me and like yes
please let's pray that these never come
back and style because look these are
just not flattering on everyone on
anyone seriously so I love Senate but
like it's not gonna work out it ended up
getting these two with black dress and
the Duster or whatever you call it Ali
found some really cute things so be sure
to watch her video because they were
super cute
she's ending the blog we just left
goodwill and it picks up some item so I
just got the Duster and then I got the
black address and how much was my total
no no I think the dress was four and
then the Duster was three all of that
for literally $1 and the Duster had a
tag on Animas $66 originally so I'm so
happy with my purchases and it's a lot
that we came to this good we'll
definitely be coming here more often
I've come here before but I'll be coming
here more often and again if you guys
