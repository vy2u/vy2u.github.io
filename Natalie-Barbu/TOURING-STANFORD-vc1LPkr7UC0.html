gonna try to vlog every single day now
we just landed in San Francisco and we
just want to eat a Thai place and super
good I think we're like San Bruno right
now so that's what the city is called if
any of you guys are from here so yeah I
woke up to it but we actually like stuff
just a random place here and right
outside the San Francisco Airport but I
am so excited and it's very cold for
Jolie so not excited about that but like
that's my dad taking a selfie and so
funny
wait look is so funny
hi guys well this doesn't like being in
my vlogs but we are at Stanford
University right now we're just oh we
are we are just touring it I'm
I'm planning on transferring here guys
for engineering pursue my engineering
degree just kidding oh but yeah I've
never been here so we just wanted to
love seeing colleges for fun and so yeah
it's really pretty um outside it's not
that pretty but like once we're inside
the campus it's nice
oh I was zoomed in hopefully you can see
me so please guys this campus is so nice
it's really really pretty I don't know
if the camera does it justice but I just
really love like the Spanish
architecture super cute I love touring
other colleges because now that I'm in
college I like kind of know I don't know
I just like try to picture myself in
these places Wow so for gang nice let me
know how many of you guys live in like
the Bay Area
cuz a row I just think that'd be cool
and I'm actually going to LA in a few
days and I'm also going to LA for Labor
Day to visit stuff so that'll be fun so
if you guys live here let me know so
like I don't know maybe we can meet up
or something maybe just a suggestion
Chloe do you think he'll come here we're
touring this for Chloe you think you'll
get in you think you can get into this
school
Lucas do you think you could get in you
do that's the spirit when I was your age
I thought I can get into Princeton
those are the days don't lose hope
though we are now in here building yeah
pretty pretty interesting and looks a
little different than NC State
oh there's a class going on huh what are
we just walked in we totally good I
don't know one could get us out how
beautiful we're at this garden is so
pretty so nice I'm like this campus it's
just so nice guys I wanna play the
engineering building though cause I
think that's be close visited um and
obviously Stanford engineering like kind
of goes hand-in-hand but we're gonna go
to the bookstore so maybe I'll get a
shirt that'd be cool and kind of there's
one of the buildings guides it's an
engineering lab so not really like an
engineering building but it's an
engineering lab so kind of here it is
it's very nice I like em obsessed with
the architecture here it is so nice how
many times I have to say that I don't
know count keep track of how many times
they say that about this campus in the
bookstore this is it band-aid so
so I want to get this shirt just because
I visit college I want to like buy a
shirt and it's actually like Nike and
like I don't know I can wear it it's not
just like an ugly t-shirt so I think
Chloe wants another one Kobe did you see
are a smoker is really nice and like
Stanford has someone one of my favorite
colors shirts or color like mascots but
it's like subtle so I like
we should get this for my mom even
though she's not a Stanford mom and just
be kind of funny
the building is so nice I think it's a
newer building yeah we're a little lost
I bought a shirt excited about that I'll
wear it around campus
um don't ikon b.i next year I am serious
she's not actually harming here oh he
says he's my mom's waiting in the car
though so she's probably gonna be super
gone like 30 minutes sorry mom no
worries
Lucas are you enjoying the Painted
Ladies ok can I take one I fall for hair
mousse yes look at cinema can you make
another party you're there the teenage
problem that's exciting
this is like where the pool house is but
like oh he's getting already done so you
can look through really ugly and it's
not like the green pristine glass of
grass a full house so that's kind of
disappointing but it is a bit um we just
went where we just got back from Lombard
Street I think that's what it's called
it's like the whiny twisty road he'll
you're out there maybe for like two
minutes or something like that because
it is so cold it is July and 20 degrees
outside
yeah I really think it's like 20 degrees
outside cuz it's sunny when the windy
windy road I'm sure shivering yeah it's
really cold so that's why and there's
like a ton of people so I got like I'm
gonna footage there for my outfits video
but like probably not a good amount it's
really pretty though it's just a little
too cold it's going wrong yeah it does
not feel like summer
it's definitely winter winter in July um
yeah that's why I didn't vlog that but I
felt like I should update you guys
anatomical my cousin is here which I'd
really exciting I had no idea she was
here but I saw her and super on her
snapchat is like oh like I'm gonna save
it just go to so we're gonna get dinner
tonight and yeah do you guys later I am
closing out the blog we just went to
dinner and I did not vlog that but it
wasn't anything like crazy or special um
