today I come to you from my kitchen and
I am so excited I am eating food in this
video so that is always a good thing
when you eat food in my opinion but
anyways today I am filming a unboxing /
trying on earth trying on pilot trying
holiday trees from around the world I
think this is so cool because I filmed
like a-tryin Mexican candy lon and
that's got a really great response and
love it so you guys like when I try
through and giving my opinion on it i
guess like I like food critics now so
skidding i'm totally not if I can try to
wear all this is what the bottom like so
a little bit but I reckon it's like I
mess it up um but they actually have
food all down the world obscure a
subscription service so you pay a
certain amount month and then you get
one of these boxes for free and you get
swole not for free but you a one of
these boxes in and it's different every
single month so it's super cool and a
lot of it is cooking ingredients and
that has recipes on how you can use
these ingredients to make these
authentic liquid
happy one it kind of just like not candy
but like a holiday truce one I thought I
was super cool because around the
holiday season is very appropriate so my
cooking videos kind of start now the up
so I'm just going to unbox this review
guys and show you guys I am kind of turn
my opinion on them and when I talk to
school is that it comes with this little
thing right here and this is a try the
world culture guys so it tells you look
what it comes to it and where it came
from and also there's a promo code on
the back of this if you guys want to sit

think this is a great website for trying
different foods because I hate when I'm
I like love exploring new foods and
especially if you live in a place where
there's not that many foreign
restaurants you can try that many
different foods like when I lived in
South Florida we went to every single
country's restaurant ever and now in
working on Linna there's like mexican
american italian and that's it so you

branch of food here so i love this sock
