with Nicole this is a very exciting
video because we have never too loud
before and we're finally collaborating
and we both are in LA so we figure it
and we are doing a style swapping video
so I am just so excited because we
actually went shopping her video which
is like so freaking fun if you guys came
from her Channel please be sure to
comment down below and subscribe if
you're new here and if you guys are
watching this video definitely go and
check out her video after this one show
some love give her comments subscribe to
her channel she makes amazing videos we
basically just stylus walk so I picked
up another for her and then she picked
out for me I have full faith in her hey
everyone we are outside of Topshop right
now I home we are doing a the style song
challenge of video your outside of
Topshop at the Grove right now and so la
of us yeah jump right into it
but what is that is it like we're under
your boobs
the limits that we're spending in 50
bucks ish around that because like we
don't want to send like a thousand
dollars and $400 on each other because
you know like we're rolling on a budget
we're both college so I mean I cannot
wait because shopping for a video is
like my dream a limit on 15 so I'm gonna
go straight to the clearance section
right now because you girls can't afford
a lot of us this like I know I'm
supposed to be shopping for her but like
I really really need this it's so
freaking cute oh my gosh it's also four
hundred and seventy five dollars so a
little out of our budget
you know oh my god grunting like a disco
everything I love is what I need yes
okay well this will work great for her I
give in chickens on it they're doing LA
today so so I got in trouble for filming
in here it's also really overages now at
Camp bellman here so I'm like I just got
out of Topshop and I got her her items
like pretty close to budget but I'm not
sure if she stayed close to budget so
I'm good it was really really hard
just because topics like prettying some
time and I was like it was for myself
because I feel like if I
I kind of like
I was just trying to
all right so if I'm gonna try it on and
then I pictured stuff and if you guys
want to see her channel so few very very
my style I picked out this is great top
is really really nice houses like Chris
props material strength is so cute
really really really cute super soft and
cozy and especially because it's so cold
where I live skirt so it was white
sometimes skirt really cute and I wasted
and if it's me really nicely so it's
like it broke so the only thing that we
had left was it one of the chains
supposed to be like a layered one so
we're
that is the final look so to see her
outfit and go to her video which will be
linked down below but I hope you guys
enjoyed bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
