grace we are going to Starbucks and we
are going to use some homework actually
Chapel Hill is not finished with classes
yet I'm like NC State so I'm basically
done I just had like exams left and my
first exam isn't for a while so I'm
going to edit all the pictures from the
fashion show last night so cool like I
cannot wait to post those if you guys
have a yesterday's vlog which is
technically like the one I'm going to be
uploading today it's of the fashion show
I was a photographer for it and I show
you guys all the behind the scenes stuff
so definitely go and watch that and I'll
have like links to everything down below
but yeah so I'm excited to do vlogmas
and we're just going to go do some work
right now so update guys it's about 20
minutes later and we're still looking
for a Starbucks we went to one Starbucks
and it was full so we were like all
right there's one five minutes away I
will just go to that one so we go to
this one and it's full again and like we
actually need to get work done so now
we're going to the Barnes &amp;amp; Noble which
is across the street and if that one is
full then I don't know we're gonna do
but it better not be we'll sit on the
floor or something like Orson we're
going to work there another update guys
um grace and I have been to two
Starbucks a Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and with this
Barnes Noble had a couple tables so that
was good and they had no outlets the
only outlet was in a restroom and my
computer's dead and graces would die in
the time that we were planning on
spending there like what place that
you're meant to like calm and do work
has no outlets I mean I'm just like my
boy Matt Barnes and although if you're
watching this like get that together and
get some outlets like I know you don't
want people using your electricity but
if you want to be competition with the
other cafes like you need outlets so now
we're just I've been driving around for
like who knows how long
trying to find a freaking place to study
whoa the pain is just ridiculous yeah
they met you some grace in that trying
to find a coffee shop really hi I was
just wondering do you guys have any open
tables right now at all open tables like
any people that aren't sitting at tables
right now you're completely busy okay
thank you
finals week
still with grace we just got done
studying at Barnes &amp;amp; Noble when we got
here it was daytime was like 3:00 and
now it's 9:00 they're kicking us out I
still have stuff to do so I think I'm
gonna do that but I'll just do that like
when I get back home I just have to like
edit pictures up the fashion show my
book blog from yesterday I just went up
so you guys are watching this haven't
seen that go watch it it's the fashion
show one super cool I also posted a
picture of one of the ones that I took
so yeah it might combine tomorrow's vlog
because I literally did look so
literally did nothing today besides
study and I didn't vlog inside a barn
Sonoma Walt oh yeah I might combine the
two but let me know what you guys want
me to do or actually no because you'll
be watching this that was a stupid
comment I'm about to go and just do more
work so this might be the end of day 4
first meal of the day with some avocado
toast again
I just finished my last avocado so I'm
gonna have to go and buy some more so
good you guys definitely recommend this
meal what's up guys so um I barely have
vlogs like the past two days be just
because again I sound like broken record
but it really is finals week so I don't
do much and I just got back from the gym
though so here's my workout clothes I
got the shirt from Goodwill hey it's
Nike but it was about three dollars um
yes I'm gonna try to put this up today
to have an actual main Channel video
come out tomorrow I segment main channel
even though these vlogs are on my main
channel but I say main channel because
it's like an actual like hey like
YouTube sit down talking video not like
a vlog so yeah hopefully you guys like
these even if I'm just chill and relaxed
you guys say that to like it but also I
found out that YouTube has this
algorithm where it will show the videos
the most comments and the most likes
first it doesn't really show the ones
that don't get a lot please please
comment whatever you guys want down
below like I won't have a conversation
with you guys so please comment down
below and thumbs this video up that
would help me a lot I kind of sound
annoying saying that but like honestly
this YouTube algorithm sucks I don't
know why all these social media sites
are trying to make algorithms when
everyone
one person who's like yeah you know what
I actually like the algorithm no like I
don't understand what why they don't
just put everything in chronological
order
I don't get it but yeah that's that's
going on in my life right now so I'm
about to hop in the shower and I'll talk
to you guys later
