there's no editing or anything in this
so i am doing the stripped-down
challenge me and my friend steph decided
to do this so i will link her down below
so you guys can check her out and yeah
i'll have her look down below since
there's no editing i can't be like oh
here it is but oh so you guys can see
that but I today I today I am doing this
trip down challenge and the video is or
the challenge is that you basically
right or oh my god I can't talk ok you
film a video and you don't edit it you
know I'm music it's literally from start
to finish I'm just gonna upload this to
my computer and import it to YouTube
that's it and that's what this video is
and I saw it today I was like freaking
out cuz I was really stressed out today
I've just had so much school work going
on and it's just what it has just been
really really hard and dudes not been
really the best day but I'm about to go
home for Thanksgiving break so that'll
be nice but I don't have any makeup on I
just have like a little bit of face
makeup on and I was like oh gosh look I
still have to get ready for the video
and I remembered oh no I'm doing this
challenge so I kind of want it to be
like you guys are my friends I'm just
sitting down with you guys talking and
yeah so I'm going to start my timer let
me go get my phone okay so I'm about to
start the timer on my phone for ten
minutes and let's see how do I do this
how do i go time ok so it just started
ok so what this video is kind of just
going to talk to you guys about I was
thinking of what to talk about and I
didn't really know but now I'm thinking
I just don't talk to you guys about
YouTube and YouTube like and social
media because that is mainly why this
video was created it was kind of a
response video to a cena O'Neill
Senate O'Neill and I really know how to
say her name her video of how she is
quitting social media and how social
media is fake and it's bad and it sucks
and everyone is fake on it and I watch
only a little bit of her video I
basically got the gist of it out after I
watched a ton of other videos in
response to hers but I just kind of want
to say that I don't really agree with
her I agree with her to an extent but
her thing was that social media is fake
and everyone on is fake and I think it's
because she was kind of so traumatized
by what it did to her like she became so
wrapped up in it and to an extent that
is true um but it also has to do with
how you take it so I am on social media
obviously I would I don't have as many
forwards as her i'm not-- nowhere near
as magus her about still like have a
presence on social media and she just I
think got so wrapped up in it but I am
NOT wrapped up in it I don't really care
about how many followers I have people
ask me like they're like oh how many for
so you have like I know it's around like
five to six thousand it's on Instagram
and I know my YouTube subscribers it's
anywhere from like it's a 29,000
something but I don't know the exact
number i'm not wrapped up in it i'm not
having i don't have on my lick biography
like when will we hit this goal when
will we hit 500,000 when will we get six
seven thousand like a lot of people have
goals for how many numbers that they
want to reach and i just don't feel the
need to do that because my goal is not
to have a million subscribers honestly
like that's really not my goal my goal
is to keep making youtube videos until I
don't want to anymore and hopefully that
is not very soon hopefully that's never
but that's my goal just to keep making
YouTube videos because I love it and yes
the opportunities that come out of it
are great and yes to say they have Devon
followers is cool I guess but that's not
why I'm in it and sadly that can happen
to anyone though and it can happen in
any environment that were in not only
social media so I think her environment
was just social media but I'm sure if
she was on if she had a real like if she
had a job like being a i don't know like
even just someone a normal job that is
not they
videos it's just like a nine-to-five
office job if she had that job she might
be obsessed with climbing up the ladder
and tearing people down along the way or
being fake to her boss along the way or
anything just to get a raise or anything
just to climb up the corporate ladder
and then she would make a video saying
how fake corporate America is or
whatever something like that even though
she's not from America but you guys know
what I'm talking about something like
that it really just depends on how you
make it and how do you / train yourself
and how what you think of it what is
your goal and to me honestly my goal in
life is not to be famous it's not to
have a million subscribers that would be
cool I'm not going to say I don't want
that but that is not my goal I think my
goal in life is to honestly just stay
true to myself and stay have morals and
but the thing is like she lost her
morals along the way like that's not
good i'm not gonna let myself get like
that and to my goal is to like please
God and to make God happy and be the
best person I can be in that and to be a
light to others and to be a good
testimony to others and to kind of show
God's love through my life and through
yeah like through how I limit and
hopefully people can see that when they
meet me or hopefully you guys can see
that through my videos that that's all
I'm trying to do and that's kind of why
I do know why i do youtube with that i
know that i have a platform and i know
it could be a good influence to you guys
even though I didn't sign up to be a
role model I still can be good influence
and if I am someone's role model then I
appreciate it and I'm not going to say
like you I hate being a role model or
anything like that like I hope I am I
hope people know that I'm also human and
I make mistakes and stuff like that but
yeah I mean that's my goal in life and
that is why i do youtube videos also
because it makes me happy it because i
know i can reach so many of you guys and
that's awesome to me to be able to reach
younger people and people my age and
even older girls like i have me and my
best friend katie started a website for
coming rooted and it's basically all
about that i will link that down below
and i will link the video where we talk
about it down below because if i just
talked about eight you can just watch
that video to find out what
is but my goal in life is to help other
girls that's basically what I want to do
and that's why I want to help you guys
through youtube videos helping either
when you're bored and you want to watch
a YouTube video here i am we're just
helping with your makeup or fashion tips
or anything like that like that's what i
want to do and also another thing that i
meant that she mentioned in her videos
how like social media everyone is fake
and how like friends are fake on it and
everything like that and I have quite
the opposite reaction to that of course
there are fake people but it really is
all who you surround yourself with their
feet people everywhere they can be fake
people in your job at your school
literally anywhere it's not just social
media so I don't know why she targeted
social media I guess because that was
her life then I think she realized I
think she thought that just cuz she's on
social media she's encountering these
fake people need mean people when really
that's the real world thats everywhere
like you're going to encounter those
people and I am quite the opposite
reaction to that um social media has
brought me some of my closest friends to
believe it or not my best sore mmm
excuse me my best i'm here on youtube
Steph friend she's awesome and we met
through social media we went on a trip
to New York together she's coming to
visit me at home during Christmas I'm
going in the summer to visit her in LA
like we became such good friends and we
support each other it is not tearing
people down I tried to lift her up and I
try to always encourage her about our
videos and let her know how awesome they
are because they are amazing you guys
really go check her out but just like I
we support each other she lets me know
like hey I loved that video like she
gives me tips on how to film she gives
me tips on like hey like when I feel
like this is what we're going to do it
like where when I came over and film
like this is what I'm gonna do I'm so
excited to like have someone who
understands me better and like socially
it brings you people that understand you
better like I I don't know I bet this
video is so random and that's why I like
it's kind of scary to me that I can't
edit it because you guys are probably I
probably stopped watching already
honestly there's probably
and watching right now but um that like
social media has so many great things
that it's brought me my friend grace she
goes Chapel Hill she's a blogger um me
and her are such good friends and like I
could cause I'm like kind of standing so
that's why I keep falling because I'm
just standing me my bed and I'm like
wobbling around um but I just wanted the
studio to be kind of talking to you like
I would talk to my friends and how I
would talk to my parents and stuff like
that so that's why I filming this just
very casually I don't have makeup on I'm
just standing on the bed I didn't really
bother doing anything else to myself I
guess but social media is not fake it I
don't think it is at all but also people
who say like oh my gosh my girls perfect
goals like she is goals oh my gosh
that's not good either so you guys need
to realize this even though social media
may not be fake it's not real life
either like it's not nice not real life
I think that's like the whole thing like
social media is not real life is like
her like punch line remember but it's
not like what I post is one hundred
percent my life and that's all like all
my summer trips like that's all I did
all summer just trips like I didn't have
any responsibilities or anything to do
that's all I did no I just kind of show
you my highlight reel I just show you oh
wow I took a million selfies and I just
decided to post one of them like that's
kind of what it is I just post the best
of my life and that's just because
that's kind of what i want to show like
I don't want to show my downfalls I will
talk about them i will talk to you this
out then i will explain them i will if
anyone asked about them i will not be
there to share them but i don't want
that to be my instagram to be that
there's a place for everything my
youtube I can share my downsides i'm on
my tumblr i can share my feelings on my
snapchat i'll share random parts i like
but on my Instagram I feel like that's
just I just want to show the best of
like just show people like some artsy
pictures like hey look i took this artsy
picture isn't it cool whatever but it's
not don't compare yourself to people
just because they're instagram because
look
you're also like look at your Instagram
be like a moon would i ever post the
negatives of my life on instagram and if
you would great but not everyone is like
that and i think that's kind of like
what we need to understand and it's just
so many people i think especially
younger people since they grew up with
social media I didn't really grow up
with social media like I wasn't even
fifth grade and I didn't have an
Instagram in fifth grade you know that
wasn't even a thing but nowadays like
third graders have Instagram and that
like worries me but you know and they
look up to these girls because they
think that that's their life they think
that that is what all they do like
everyone has their own problems and
everyone like right before I film this
video I was about of the verge of tears
because I didn't finish a project in
time my last calc test that I took I
failed um I don't know how I'm gonna do
the semester at all I need to worry
about internships and jobs and
everything like that and thinking about
it like makes me wanna cry and I'm just
really stressed and I it sucks honestly
school sucks right now but i'm not
posting out on instagram i'm posting
like oh look at me getting ready for
semi no that's not like yeah i did that
for one hour of my day but that's not my
life you know so i think people need to
realize that social media is not real
it's not a hundred percent that's not
like my only life yeah I may have done
that for a sliver of the day but it
doesn't mean like while I was pushing it
or right before okay I 10 minutes is up
that doesn't mean like right before I
was hosting it I was freaking out and
like hyperventilating and like crying
about my life just like all of you guys
probably think that you guys are the
only ones doing that but you're not
everyone has their own struggles and I
just feel like that's what gets kind of
wrapped up in social media like I want
to do a whole other video talking about
specifically just like social media and
I don't know not editing this is so hard
and I hope that this is more of a
relatable video and you guys feel like
you're just sitting on my bed with me
talking to me because this is how I
would normally talk to guys I personally
don't really edit my
use that much like my shocking videos I
feel like I don't edit that much but
also like I edit sometimes like how when
I came in I mumbled and I like said
something wrong sometimes I'll be like
oh I did the end no I'll stop me like
okay let me redo it okay so then I did
this and then I did that I stopped I
know I can cut it out and I continue and
I redo it because i know i can cut it
out so not everyone like if you watch
when you're like wow like how's your
makeup so put together how's her how
does she like talk so smoothly I don't
know what you guys say but like stuff
like that I don't I edit it look that's
like the power of editing that's why I
got Final Cut Pro which like three
hundred and fifty dollars because I can
edit it better like that's literally
being honest with you that's why people
buy these expensive things why do you
think I have an amazing camera and spent
half my savings on my camera because I
know it looks better if I can just use a
crappy iphone with it you know I phones
aren't even that crappy anymore but
let's say I could just use an iphone
with it the video quality wanna be as
good and my videos wouldn't look as good
all that looks like DC like it's it's
not all real life it's not all a hundred
percent real it's real but it's also
just what i want to show you like I'm
not saying that I'm fake like when i
post get it ready for semi or whatever
i'm not saying that that's fake no but
there's a million other things that you
guys aren't seeing and that yeah that
moment might have probably join invited
Rodney happiness next time you might
have been fun but right before i took
that I was freaking out about something
else and my life was harder whenever you
guys what I'm saying hopefully but
that's why it's not just the it's not
moral of the story see I can't edit that
I'll moral of the story though is that
yes that one moment might be real that
one picture it was real it did happen i
didn't see it I've never edited my
picture so point minute fake I have like
whiten my teeth before and done stuff
like that just make it look better but
I've never liked made my waist smaller
or I've never um like made my eyes look
bigger or I've never done
I'd like change my hair color in this
picture like no I've never done anything
like that I've done things to enhance
site which I think are totally fine
because everyone does and don't think
that that is what i look like every
single day as you guys can see me right
now I don't look like that every single
day but that like yeah that moment might
be real but there's also a million
moments that you guys are not seeing and
social media is not all fake and it is
supportive I've made so many supportive
friends through it and people who
understand what I do and other people
don't understand i think that is Cena's
whole thing was that on social media
everyone was evil and now she's quitting
because she wants to get away from all
these mean people and all this fakeness
and all this superficial pneus but I
don't think she really says that's the
real world that's gonna be everywhere if
she has a problem with it she needs to
take herself out of these environments
not and by surrounding herself with
better people don't like she can still
have an Instagram without falling into
that trap I don't think she gets that
and if she's watching this which she's
probably not that she's like not social
media anymore good i hope you realize so
that's gonna be everywhere in school
girls are mean people are mean i have
found some of the most supportive
friends like steph and grace on social
media and not at my school and people
are superficial some people want to be
your friend just so that they can be on
youtube or instagram and that's pathetic
to me and that's in the real world like
that is just in the real world and i
think that that is what people need to
understand and people need to not take
social media as seriously as they do and
just remember that that one moment is
just one little moment remember one pure
moment of a good and happiness in your
life and that's the moment you post on a
tram and then the rest behind the scenes
so if you guys want more videos like
this look where I'm just talking to you
guys let me know but this view is
literally a mess I don't even know what
I talked about it i literally don't i
think i'm still like so stressed out
from school but i want any more videos
like this this video may have been awful
but at least I kind of talked to you
guys about what I think about all of
this
you know if this was worth watching for
you guys i hope it was oh and everyone's
insecure I see I'm I'm very insecure I
will be the first to admit have such an
insecure person and if you guys want me
to dive into my insecurities and kind of
talk about the people being insecure and
Suffolk that's so much to say my brain
right now it's like a mix of things like
oh don't forget to say that and say that
and say that and say that and I just
want to tell you guys everything so i
think what i'm going to do is if you
guys want i will make a more organized
video where i write out my thoughts and
then i go a video on it so it's not this
trouble nests or if you want me to do
another strip down challenge on another
series let me know because i totally low
because these are so easy to film um
yeah look these are so easy to film cuz
i don't have to edit cuz normally i can
spend eight hours editing a video eight
hours so just keep that in mind um yeah
i hope you guys know that I yeah okay
well that was a piss video make sure
that you check out stephs video because
i'm sure hers is better than Mike she's
like more put together and stuff and but
yeah let's check out her video and I
can't have anything here because it's
not edited but um let me know we think
of this video I hope you guys like day
and I hope it wasn't too long you know
about to go home for Thanksgiving break
so I'm so excited but it's gonna be such
a stressful breaks so much to do and
violence ions are soon okay but I have
like a million videos coming up I'm
literally going so much so let me know
