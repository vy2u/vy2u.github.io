since there's no editing or anything in
this so I am doing these stripped-down
challenge me and my friend Steph decided
to do this so I will link her down below
so you guys can check her out and yeah
I'll have her link down below since
there's no editing I can't be like oh
here it is but as you guys can see that
but I today I today I am doing the
stripped-down challenge and the video is
or the challenge is that you basically
write or oh my god I can't talk okay you
film a video and you don't ever date you
know my music it's literally from start
to finish I'm just gonna upload this to
my computer and import it to YouTube
that's it and that's what this video is
and I saw it today I was like freaking
out cuz I was really stressed out today
I've just had so much schoolwork going
on and it's just it has just been really
really hard and Judes not been really
the best day but i'm about to go home
for Thanksgiving break so that'd be nice
but I don't have any makeup on I just
have like a little bit of face makeup on
and I was like oh gosh like I still have
to get ready for the video and I
remembered oh no I'm doing this
challenge so I kind of want it to be
like you guys are my friends
I'm just sitting down with you guys
talking and yeah so I'm going to start
my timer let me go get my phone okay so
I'm about to start the timer on my phone
up for 10 minutes and let's see how do I
do this
Oh China okay so he just started okay so
this video is kind of just going to talk
to you guys about I was thinking of what
to talk about and I didn't really know
but now I'm thinking I just don't talk
to you guys about YouTube and YouTube
like and social media because that is
mainly why this video was created it was
kind of a response video to essena
o'neill Zoar senate ownio and i know how
to say her name her video of how she is
quitting social media and how social
media is fake and it's bad and it sucks
and everyone is fake on it and i watched
only a little bit of her video i
basically got the gist of it out after i
watched a ton of other videos in
response to hers but i just kind of have
to say that i don't really agree with
her I agree with her to an extent but
her thing was that social media is fake
and everyone on it is fake and I think
it's because she was kind of surprised
by what it did to her like she became so
wrapped up in it and to an extent that
is true but it also has to do with how
you take it so I am on social media
obviously I would I don't have as many
followers as her I'm no no where near as
may kiss her but I'm still like how the
presence on social media and she just I
think got so wrapped up in it but I am
not wrapped up in it I don't really care
about how many followers I have people
asking me you like there I go how many
followers do you have
you know like I know it's around like
five to six thousand it's on Instagram
and I know my YouTube subscribers it's
anywhere from like it's a 29,000
something but I don't know the exact
number I'm now wrapped up in and I'm not
having I don't have on my like biography
like when will we hit this goal but will
we hit 500,000 when will we get 600,000
like a lot of people have goals for how
many numbers that they want to reach and
I just don't feel the need to do that
because my goal is not to have a million
subscribers honestly like that's really
not my goal my goal is to keep making
YouTube videos until I don't want to
anymore and hopefully that is not very
soon hopefully that's never but that's
my goal just to keep making youtube
videos because I love it and yes the
offers your needs that come out of it
rate and yes it sustaining of them and
followers is cool I guess but that's not
why I'm in it and sadly that could
happen to anyone though and it can
happen in any environment that we're in
not only social media so I think her
environment was just social media but
I'm sure if she was on if she had a real
like if she had a job like being a I
don't know like even just someone a
normal job that is not making videos
it's just like a nine-to-five office job
if she had that job she might be
obsessed with climbing up the ladder and
tearing people down along the way or
being fake to her boss along the way or
anything just to get a raise or anything
just to climb up the corporate ladder
and then she would make a video saying
how fake corporate America is or
whatever something like that even though
she's not from America but you guys know
what I'm done no something like that it
really just depends on how you make it
and how do you portray yourself and how
what you think of it what is your goal
and to me honestly my goal in life is
not to be famous it's not to have a
million subscribers that would be cool
I'm not gonna say I don't want that but
that is not my goal I think my goal in
life is to honestly just stay true to
myself and stay have morals and the
thing is like she lost her morals along
the way like that's not good I'm not
gonna let myself get like that and to my
goal is to like please God and to make
God happy and be the best person I can
be in that and to be a light to others
and to be a good testimony to others and
to kind of show God's love through my
life and through ya like through how I
limit and hopefully people can see that
when they meet me or hopefully you guys
can see that through my videos that
that's all I'm trying to do and that's
kind of why I do know why I do YouTube
but that I know that I have a platform
and I know I could be a good influence
to you guys even though I didn't sign up
to be a role model I still can be a good
influence and if I am someone's role
model then i apprec--
and I'm not gonna say like you I hate
being a role model or anything like that
like I hope I am I hope people know that
I'm also human and they make mistakes
and stuff like that but yeah I mean
that's my goal in life and that is the
why I do youtube videos also because it
makes me happy and because I know I can
reach so many of you guys and that's
awesome to me to be able to reach
younger people and people my age and
even older girls like I have me and my
best friend Katie started a website
becoming rooted and it's basically all
about that I will link that down below
and I will link the video where we talk
about it down below cuz if I just talked
about eight you can just watch that
video to find out what it is but my goal
in life is to help other girls that's
basically what I want to do and that's
why I want to help you guys through
YouTube videos helping either when
you're bored and you want to use your
video Here I am or just helping with
your makeup or fashion tips or anything
like that like that's what I want to do
and also another thing that I meant that
she mentioned in her videos her like
social media everyone is fake and how
like the friends are fake on it and
everything like that and I have quite
the opposite reaction to that of course
there are fake people but it really is
all who you surround yourself with their
feed people everywhere that can be fake
people in your job at your school
literally anywhere it's not just social
media so I don't know why she targeted
social media I guess cuz that was her
life then I think she realized I think
she thought that just cuz she's on
social media she's encountering these
fake people and mean people when really
that's the real world that's everywhere
like you're going to encounter those
people and I am quite the opposite
reaction to that social media has
brought me some of my closest friends -
believe it or not my guests or excuse me
my that's right here I'm YouTube Steph
friend she's awesome and we met through
social media we went on a trip to New
York together she's coming to visit me
at home during Christmas I'm going you
in the summer to visit her in LA like we
became such good friends and we support
each other it is not tearing people down
I tried to lift her up and I try to
always encourage her about our videos
and let her know how awesome they are
because they are amazing you guys really
go
check her out but just like I we support
each other she lets me know like hey I
loved that video like she gives me tips
on how to film she gives me tips on like
hey like when I feel like this is what
we're gonna do it like we're when I do
whoever I will film like this is what
I'm gonna do I'm so excited to like have
someone who understands me better and
like social media brings you people that
understand you better like I I don't
know I then this video is so random and
that's why like it's kind of scary to me
that I can't edit a because you guys are
probably have probably stopped watching
already honestly there's probably no one
watching right now but that like social
media has so many great things that it's
brought me when I friend grace she goes
Chapel Hill she's a blogger
me and her are such good friends and
like I can cuz I like kind of standing
so that's why I keep falling because I'm
just standing in my bed and I'm like
wobbling around um but I just wanted to
city up to be kind of talking to you
like I would talk to my friends and how
I would talk to my parents and stuff
like that so that's why I'm filming this
just very casually I don't have makeup
on I'm just standing on the bed I didn't
really bother doing anything else to
myself I guess but social media does not
think it I don't think it is at all but
also people who say like oh my gosh that
girl's perfect goals like she is goals
oh my gosh that's not good either so you
guys need to realize that you know
social media may not be fake it's not
real life either like it's not nice not
real life I think that's like the whole
thing like social media is not real life
it's like her like punchline around but
it's not like what I post is 100% of my
life and that's all like all my summer
trips like that's all I did all summer
just trips like I didn't have any
responsibilities or anything to do
that's all I did
no I just kind of showing you my
highlight reel I just show you oh wow I
took a million selfies and I just decide
to post one of them like that's kind of
what it is I just post the best of my
life and that's just because that's kind
of what I want to show like I don't want
to show my downfalls I will talk about
them I will talk to you guys out then I
will explain that I will if anyone asked
I will not be embarrassed to share them
but I don't want that to be my Instagram
to be that there's a place for
everything my YouTube I can share my
downsides I get online on my tumblr I
can share my feelings on my snapchat
I'll share random parts my life but on
my Instagram I feel like that's just I
just want to show the best of like just
show people like some artsy pictures
like hey look I took this artsy picture
isn't it cool whatever but it's not
don't compare yourself to people just
because they're Instagram because look
at your also look look at your Instagram
be like huh moon what I ever post the
negatives of my life on Instagram and if
you would great but not everyone is like
that and I think that's kind of like
what we need to understand and it's just
so many people I think especially
younger people since they grew up with
social media I didn't really grow up
with social media like I wasn't even 5th
grade and I didn't have an Instagram in
fifth grade you know it wasn't even a
thing but nowadays like third graders
have Instagram and not like worries me
but you know and they look up to these
girls because they think that that's
their life they think that that is what
all they do like everyone has their own
problems and everyone like right before
I film this video I was about of the
verge of tears because I didn't finish a
project in time my last cow test that I
took I failed I don't know how I'm gonna
do this semester at all I need to worry
about internships and jobs and
everything like that I ain't thinking
about it like makes me wanna cry and I'm
just really stressed and I it sucks
honestly school sucks right now and but
I'm not posting now on Instagram I'm
posting like oh look at me
getting ready for semi no that's not
like yeah I did that for one hour of my
day but that's not my life you know so I
think people need to realize that social
media is not real it's not a hundred
percent that's not like my only life
yeah I may have done that for a sliver
of the day that doesn't mean like while
I was posting at her right before okay
nine ten minutes is up that doesn't mean
like right before I was posting it I was
freaking out and like hyperventilating
and like crying about my life just like
all of you guys probably think that you
guys are the only ones doing that but
you're not everyone has their own
struggle
and I just feel like that's what gets
kind of wrapped up and social media like
I want to do a whole other video talking
about specifically just like social
media and I don't know not editing this
it's so hard and I hope that this is
more of a relatable video and you guys
feel like you're just sitting on my bed
with me talking to me because this is
how I would normally talk guys
I personally don't really edit my videos
that much like my shocking videos I feel
like I don't edit that much but also
like I in it sometimes like how when I
came in I mumbled and I like said
something wrong sometimes I'll be like
oh I did the admit no I'll stop me like
okay let me redo it okay so then I did
this and then I did that I stopped I
know I can cut it out and I continue and
I redo it because I know I can cut it
out
so not everyone like if you watch when
you're like wow like how's your makeup
so put together how is her how this she
like talked so smoothly I don't know
what you guys say but like stuff like
that I don't I edit it like that's like
the power of editing that's why I got
Final Cut Pro which is like $350 is my
competitive manner like that's literally
of being honest with you that's why
people buy these expensive things why do
you think I have an amazing camera and
spent half my savings on my camera
because I know it looks better if I can
just use a crappy iPhone with it you
know icons aren't even that crappy
anymore but let's say I could just use
an iPhone with it the video quality
wouldn't be as good and my videos
wouldn't look as good all of that looks
like DC like it's it's not real life
it's not all a hundred percent real it's
real but it's also just what I want to
show you like I'm not saying that I'm
fake like when I post getting ready for
semi or whatever I'm not saying that
that's fake
no but there's a million other things
that you guys aren't seeing it now yeah
that moment might have brought me joy
and I brought me happiness next time you
might have been fun but right before I
took that I was freaking out about
something else and my life was harder
whenever you guys man
hopefully but that's why it's not just
the it's not moral of the story
see I can't edit that out more off the
story though is that yes that one moment
might be real that one picture it was
real it did happen I didn't see to it
I've never entered my picture so Point
minute fake I have like whiten my teeth
before and done stuff like that just
make it look better but I've never like
made my waist smaller or I've never like
made my eyes look bigger or I've never
dyed like changed my hair color in this
picture like no I've never done anything
like that I've done things to enhance
sight which I think are totally fine
because everyone does and don't think
that that is what I look like every
single day as you guys can see me right
now I don't look like that every single
day but that like yeah that moment might
be real but there's also a million
moments that you guys are not seeing and
socially he is not all fake and it is
supportive I've made so many supportive
friends through it and people who
understand what I do and other people
don't understand I think that as Cena's
whole thing was that on social media
everyone was evil and now she's quitting
because she wants to get away from all
these mean people and all this fakeness
and all this superficial - but I don't
think she really says that's the real
world that's gonna be everywhere if she
has a problem with it she needs to take
herself out of these environments not
and by surrounding herself with better
people don't like she can still have an
Instagram without falling into that trap
I don't think she gets that and if she's
watching this which she's probably not
because she's like yeah anymore
goodnight hope you realize so that's
gonna be everywhere in school girls are
mean people are mean I have found some
of the most supportive friends like Stef
and Grace on social media and not at my
school and people are superficial some
people want to be your friend just so
that they can be on YouTube or Instagram
and that's pathetic to me and that's in
the real world like that is just in the
real world and I think that that is what
people need to understand and people
need to not take social media seriously
as they do and just remember that that
one moment is just one little moment
remember one pure moment of a good
in your life and that's the moment you
post on Instagram and then the rest
behind the scenes so if you guys want
more videos like this like where I'm
just talking to you guys let me know but
in this video is literally a mess I
don't even know what I talked about with
I literally don't I think I'm still like
so stressed out from school but I want
do more videos like this this video may
have been awful but at least I kind of
talked to you guys about what I think
about all of this I don't even know if
this was worth watching for you guys I
hope it was oh and everyone then Sakura
see I am I'm very insecure I will be the
first to admit I'm such an insecure
person and if you guys want me to dive
into my insecurities and kind of talk
about being people being insecure in
something that's so much to say my brain
right now is like a mix of things like
oh don't forget to say that and say that
and say that and say that and I just
want to tell you guys everything so I
think what I'm gonna do is if you guys
want I will make a more organized video
where I write out my thoughts and then I
: video I so it's not this trouble or if
you want me to do another stripped down
challenge on another series let me know
because I totally low because these are
so easy to them um yeah look these are
so easy to film because I don't have to
edit cuz normally I can spend 8 hours
editing a video 8 hours so just keep
that in mind um yeah I hope you guys
know that I yeah ok well that was it for
this video make sure that you check out
Steph's video because I'm sure hers is
better than mine cuz she's like more put
together and stuff and but yeah let
check out her video and I can't have
anything here because but let me know
what you think of this video I hope you
guys liked it and I hope it wasn't too
long you know I'm about to go home for
Thanksgiving break so I'm so excited but
it's gonna be such a stressful break so
much to do and final exams are soon ok
but I'd look at million videos coming up
I'm literally going so much so let me
know you guys want to see and I will
talk to you later I love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
