had but 99% of it is new and I am just
so excited I'm going to college in two
days and it's very bittersweet it's a
lot of emotions like I get really really
sad at times and then I get like excited
at other times so if you guys have gone
to college or are going this year thank
you guys know what I'm talking about
most likely but anyways I'm just gonna
jump right into it because it is huge
and I just have so much stuff to show
you guys so first things first with
bedding I got a pillow from Target
it is this filled crest luxury medium
firm down the surround pillow it's just
a plain pillow so yeah nothing too
interesting next for the bedding I also
got a erb erb on Urban Outfitters
Anthropologie quilt as my duvet cover so
this is what it looks like office picked
rub it right here
so you guys can see I am obsessed with
that I love anthropology living I have
entomology betting on my bed right now
and it's so soft and it's just amazing
so if you guys check out my room tour
you guys could see my own bedding and
that you guys can just look at the
softness because it is so soft and then
I got the pair of standard shams so
these are just so yeah shams next I got
my Jersey sheets from Target the Jersey
sheets are super soft and comfortable so
I got a light blue because I thought it
would be nice and then just plain white
which is pretty boy and the cover is a
little bit of blue on it so I just
thought like blue jersey covers next
thing I brought and I recommend bringing
even though I have a cons college yet so
I sugar mine bringing this because I
know I'm gonna work out in my own room I
am brought a I'm bringing a yoga mat
just so I can workout in my own room and
bliss do workout videos and don't have
to be bothered by anyone else so I just
brought this so I don't have to do it on
the floor and I've already had this but
I gotta add Marshalls if any of you guys
were wondering next thing is I have been
reading and watching videos and everyone
has been saying that you get sick belong
in college so I made sure to put my a
box to put my medicine in and this is
from The Container Store so it's just a
medicine box and this will be filled
with advil nyquil dayquil my tall
excedrin all the drugs that you need
will go in this box I wanted a place to
put my purses in college and I'm not
going to bring all of them but I am
probably gonna bring two or three so I
got these from the Container Store as
well it's called an accessory loop so
you just hang it and then you put your
purse on it so I just got a couple of
those next thing I got
is towel I got these made green super
soft towels I think I got two or three
of them just because I'm gonna be
washing I'm going to be doing my laundry
every single week I'm gonna set a day
and I'm just gonna do it every single
one of those days I think I'll just do
it the day that I'd have like the least
amount of classes or something like that
so yeah I'm gonna be doing my laundry
every week so I only brought three two
or three towels I also bought some face
towels but to wash my face with also
from Target I got a huge body pillow so
I got this great body pillow I'm gonna
take out of the bag because I don't
really feel like putting like in but I
am buying a futon for my room so that
when people come over they can have a
place to stay or a place to sleep if
they're spending the night so I'm gonna
put this on my futon and it's just a
gray body pillow and I got a blue body
pillow cover it from Target so I'm
excited for that because I love a body
pillow
the next thing I got from the Container
Store so think that you probably
wouldn't buy for a dorm room I became a
little creative with it not that
creative because it's been multiple
types of work but I just got a
silverware tray and I'm going to stick
this in my drawer and I'm going to
organize all my really organize my desk
with it so I can put it like pens
pencils like post-it notes index cards
anything I want just to keep my desk
organized so it's not all a big troubled
mess next thing from Target that I got
is plates like paper plates paper bowls
and silver plastic ware so I did not I'm
gonna do the dishes in my sink that I
use to wash my face and brush my teeth I
just think that's kind of gross so I'm
not doing that so I just bought paper
plates and I don't think I'm gonna be
eating in my dorm room that often I
might be wrong but I have an unlimited
dining hall plan and my dining hall is
on the seventh floor of my own building
so it's like really easy to get to the
song I have to walk across campus it's
in my own building so I feel like I'll
be using that often so next thing I got
is this hair towel so in order to for me
not to get an additional body towel to
like wrap my hair and I just got a hair
towel and it's it comes with two of them
one's light purple and one is a darker
purple so I'll just wrap my head in this
so that I don't have to
an extra towel this is one of my
favorite things that I got it is a
ladies Harry sarong I don't even know if
I'm saying that right it's just
basically a body towel that wraps so I
can just walk around my dorm with it and
I actually have a suite style dorm so my
room is actually pretty big bigger for a
normal dorm and then I share bathroom
with three other girls so it's my room
in my roommates room and then another
two other people's rooms okay so I'm not
gonna carry this because it's pretty
heavy but the next thing I got is this
mattress pad and it is a pillow memory
foam mattress topper actually so this is
what it is it's in this box I gotta add
Bath and Body Works and it is just a
mattress topper because the mattress
inside my dorm comes boys are not very
comfortable so you're definitely gonna
want to have a lot of extra cushion on
it so I just got this it's a twin extra
long because that is how much dorm rooms
are as well as mine
so yeah I just brought this it's a
therapeutic one so I feel like it's like
the tempur-pedic mattresses so I'm very
excited to use this and the next thing I
got of course in a backpack because I'm
gonna actually have to go to school and
I'm just gonna leave in my dorm all year
long so I got this backpack using the
North Face and it is just kind of like a
cream color with orange peach colored
accents on it I really like it
it is the surge to transit that is for
like design of it so anyways I have some
stuff in my backpack already just sew
them to keep like storage wise so in my
backpack
I have this
Carmindy bubble surge protector plus two
USB so it has two extra USB ports in it
or two extra plugs and then two USB
ports which I thought was super cool so
I can plug in my iPhone and not have to
use the wall plug so I can use these
other things the next thing I got is a
pencil case from Target and this is
actually just a polka dot pencil case I
use really really cute and I already
have pens and pencils so I have pens
pencils colorful pens in case I want to
color code anything highlighters erasers
extra lead for my pencils and yeah
that's it that's all I have in my pencil
case next I have a dry erase board
calendar so this is what it looks like
and I'm just gonna use this I'm gonna
use my agenda that I have I'm going to
use this for the stuff that's happening
this week so it's kind of there so I can
see it right away like whenever I'm
looking around in my room and then I got
dry erase markers to go with it it has
to dry erase markers for magnets and a
magnetic eraser so this will be it's
super nice and then from Target also I
just got a plain agenda I wanted a
super-thin a simple one because I didn't
want to carry anything bulky so it just
has a calendar and then it has days like
this where you can just write each
individual day like what homework you
have or anything like that so I'm just
going to use this so you don't fall
behind in my classes because I am an
engineering major so I know it's gonna
be pretty pitiful and then also what I
have a lot of stuff in this backpack I
have these binder clips which I thought
was so cute I'm gonna organize my papers
with these they are patterned and
they're just really cute I got them at
Target and then I have pushpins for my
molten board so these are just studded
pushpins and
these are super cute they just click the
studs that lets you see only people's
high-waisted shorts and then the next
thing I got I have a couple more in my
backpack by showing me the gist of it
I got command strips because command
ships aren't your friends in dorm rooms
you need command strips you can't nail
or put anything like that's gonna peel
off the paint so command strips are your
friends guys learn how to decorate those
I already have my shower caddy filled I
think it's the smartest when you do it
I'll just carry inside individually so I
had shampoo and conditioner guys I have
been loving this I use it at my house
but I just bought two new ones for
college it is the L'Oreal total repair
extreme reconstruction aid or
reconstructing shampoo and conditioner
it is so awesome you guys it's move
every by far my favorite shampoo and
conditioner that I have ever used so I
would check it out if I were you and I
just have a listen in here I have my
leave and Garnier sleek and shine
intensely smooth leave-in conditioner so
I just brought this with me and then I
have my detangler comb brush this is the
best brush I have ever had and you use
when it's wet and does not hurt your
hair at all it just detangles it and
it's awesome and then I just have a Maui
hibiscus beach shower gel from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works
so yeah oh and I have a comb which after
that I guess I don't really need to come
but I just brought a comb because you
never know this I guess this could be
used in the shower like with conditioner
and stuff and then my shower caddy is
from the in tanks or so I have one bin
over here and I just got this great from
Target it's just neutral colors which I
like and this is gonna meet my
electronics bin I don't have anything in
here yet except for batteries I just
brought double-a and triple-a batteries
because just in case I need batteries
for any like reason I don't want to have
to ask people or like buy them so I
brought them just in case I need them
okay so I also have another one of these
bins which is the exact same bin except
this one is filled so I'm not gonna take
everything out because it was kind of
hard putting everything in here but I
love telling you everything that's in
here so I have this this fabric Flickr
fabric with freshener
fabric spray or fabric perfume I don't
know you should spray that for breeze on
your fabric and it is a Hawaiian cents
just so that I can keep my room smelling
clean and so I can keep my clothes
smelling clean because I do not want to
have any smell in my room because that
would just be gross
and then I also have it here um what are
they called the fabric I take this one
out it is the bounce fabric the
freshness whatever fabric softener
freshener you just put these in the
dryer when you draw on your
then I have Tide Pods because those are
gonna help me so much in college they're
just gonna save a lot of space and time
so I just have to pause for when I do my
laundry then I also have a air freshener
just for the bathroom or the room again
just so that it's smelling fresh it's
glad and it's also a Hawaiian one and
then I have a rice all disinfected white
it's just because I don't want to get
sick in college as much as other people
do so I'm just going to make sure I wipe
down everything every time someone comes
in my room and then I have hand soap
from a bath and Bodyworks over here guys
we are almost done so I'm sorry this
video is just a mess but my room is a
mess because of all the storm stuff so I
just have it this I don't even know
what's called like a traveling makeup
traveling bag so you just hook it on
something over there and here is I've
already filled it up so my top I'll show
you guys this my top one has the bobby
pins hair ties the little elastic hair
ties that are clear like for braids or
anything like that and then I have two
hair clips in the top one right over

bands or anything like that
one in this middle one I just have any
leave-in hair things besides our
leave-in conditioner so I have a oil I
have a heat protecting spray I have my
bed head after I figure out what it's
called after party so I can put that
just to make my hair smooth and then I

Container Store

have the container sort this is what it
looks like so it is just a quick so I'm
gonna point my closet to keep my laundry
dirty clothes and then I have a six
compartment canvas hanging sweater bag
so this is just gonna hang in my closet
and I'm just gonna put my sweaters and
any other random clothes that I need
folded and I'm just going to put them in
here
it's gonna save a ton of space because
you guys know I have a lot of clothes
and dorm closets on that bag so I'm
gonna have a problem with that so that
is why I did that just for extra storage
and then I also have a ten compartment
canvas hanging shoe bag so I would put
ten shoes in here and I made two stores
and maybe like one or two more at the
bottom
I might just bring ten I'm not exactly
sure I haven't packed my clothes yet and
they leave in two days but I think I'm
fine okay so I had a makeup or not
making up a accessory organizer so I
just am keeping my next room and
everything I don't wear a lot of jewelry
so I'm honestly trying to fill this up
like I don't even know what to put in
here so I just filled it up not even
halfway this is like one side and then I
have a whole other backside so yeah I
think that's all I'm bringing to college
I don't really wear jewelry guys so I'm
also bringing these under the bed
storage drawers so in the bottom drawer
I have my shorts and my skirts in the
middle drawer I have my pajamas and
athletic clothes and in the top drawer

drawer I have my triangle swing swim bag
right here and I just put some bathing
suits in there because I don't need that
many bathing suits so I just brought a
