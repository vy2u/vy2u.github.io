my channel I don't blog together all
this hi welcome back to my channel I am
here with Jess sitting down in the
corner if you hear any random noises
that's her peace sign but right now if
you guys don't recognize the location
that I'm in it's because I am in Los
Angeles California and I moved here for
the summer so if you guys didn't know
that then make sure follow me on my vlog
channel because I have been daily
vlogging basically every single day so
be sure to subscribe to that and if
you're new to my channel hi I'm Natalie
I post a lot of like random lifestyle
ish videos and today I filmed the ugly
photoshoot location or ugly location
photo shoot challenge I filmed that with
my friend grace she came to visit me and
if you guys want to see her photos and
the rest of her photos then go to her
blog and check them out I'll have
everything linked down below but I did
this video kind of vlog style for you
guys so I've logged the whole like time
that we were taking the pictures and
stuff but I just want to come on here
and like actually talk about the photos
the first location that we went to kind
of turned out to be a fail because we
first tried going to Best Buy and then
we tried taking it in front of a post
office like truck we first tried going
to Best Buy and that didn't work
we asked them and they were like yeah
you're like it'd have to email corporate
if you want to take pictures in here so
we were not about to do that so we found
a post USPS post office truck right
outside of best vine we were like why
not just try to take pictures here
hopefully they don't get mad at us for
doing that I don't know the laws about
around like what we take pictures of or
not but this is the ugly Postal Service
whore I feel like it's not typically a
place on a random street where you would
take photos so cross your fingers
there's some police officers over there
so I'm hoping they don't get mad at us I
don't know if this is illegal I don't
think it is I don't see why it would be
but it worse comes to worse they'll just
tell us to stop and yeah so a lady get a
leg oh no good and so we're gonna try
then we went to a dumpster this is our
new location we found a dumpster here at
this like rent-a-car lot so we're doing
it right here we actually asked the
owner he was probably so confused why we
asked to take a photo for him it's um
sir but it's fine and guess what it
doesn't have a driver so it's not gonna
drive away on us so this is the first
location
prai's there's literally a whole entire
busy street of cars while just watching
us take photos in front of them sir so
this is so la of us how many snapshots
are we gonna be on and the photos that
we got in front of the dumpster so it
was such an ugly location this was
definitely the most challenging I think
because it was so ugly like there's
literally nothing cute about a dumpster
so we had to try to like make it
creative so my pictures I really wanted
them to be zoomed in so you could only
see like the graffiti behind the
dumpster and I didn't want it to be I
wanted you to not be able to tell kind
of where we were I've tried to take some
like standing a little further back so
you could kind of see my body in it and
like squatting and I don't know making
some pose and this is definitely the
most challenging one um I don't even
really like love this photo it was just
more of a challenge because like there
was nothing what's like my aesthetic
there like everything was ugly so we
just had to get really close zooms in
and I tried editing it the best I could
but let me know if you guys like this
one in the next location that we chose
was a bus stop and this one they had a
ton of people around it so that was the
most challenging part and bus stops in
LA are not cute they're just like little
benches with a bunch of advertisements
on them and a bunch of people in the bus
stops at all times and so that was
really hard because a lot of people were
kind of making comments to us and our
next
location it's gonna be right in front of
the dumpster and it's going to be a bus
stop we're gonna be waiting until
everyone leaves so just because that's
kind of annoying if we're there taking
pictures well hope you are sitting on a
bus so we're just waiting until they
leave but so forth the dumpster I think
what's successful for ugly green was a
question do you want in front of the
phone yeah yeah it wasn't it was it was
really funny it was to say the least I
really liked it because the movie
advertisement that was on my bus shop
that I took pictures at it was like a
pink and blue like a summer vibe movie
poster so I figured if we got close or
like had that be the main focus the bus
stop would be kind of cute I ended up
liking that one kind of I don't know I
felt like these pictures are so hard I
think I like to the last location the
best but for me it was just like really
really hard kind of getting in to the
taking pictures mode especially when
like it's like a busy intersection a
bunch of people are around you and
you're taking pictures at a bus stop
like people are probably like what the
heck are you doing the next location
that we did was the parking garage so we
ended up going into the parking around
to where we parked and we were gonna go
to McDonald's but I feel like everyone
does fast-food restaurants and they're
honestly kind of trendy now like I feel
like everyone like I just posted a
picture on my Instagram at Mia in and
out and like it wasn't for this
challenge you know so like fast food
restaurants are starting to be really
trendy for photos we were on our way to
McDonald's but stopped right here where
we parked in the parking garage and we
were like this is like why not try it
here I think we actually finish up
because we're just gonna do three
locations so my hope you guys hope it
turned out well
once the Edit it I think it'll be like
way cooler but
really happy that's like the way they
turned out and some people hopefully we
have gotten a lot of weird looks today
even in LA you would think that we
wouldn't because everyone like has a
camera here and like take pictures of
who knows what still gone weird looks
you guys are excited the photos are
great you guys I know I'm excited
the lighting is horrible everything
about this is not cute like we can try
to make this look good and these were my
favorite ones so we got some really cool
like blue lights in them which just came
up when we took the picture like we
didn't edit it that into it which I
thought was really cool and it just
looks like we were like I don't know
like in a futuristic movie type scene I
loved the way that turned out with like
the lights right behind us and we had
the shutter speed on like a super super
slow shutter speed so we have to stand
really really still but like the cars
and the people in the background we're
moving and it was just so cool so I
really really loved this location this
is my favorite one but yeah I thought it
was really cool and I'm the way I added
today I made it like that before picture
was so ugly so the way I had a date I
thought was really nice that was all the
locations that we went to so if you guys
liked any of them let me know and let me
know which one was your favorite and be
sure to go check out Grace's blog
because she edited all the pictures
herself so ours are a lot different like
we both edited them our own style so go
check her out and let me know which one
you guys like them the best that is it
for this video I had so much fun filming
it I've never done one of these
challenges before but I just thought
it'd be so much fun and so cool and
grace was like the perfect person to do
it with she's always taking picture
don't comment down below which one was
your favorites subscribe if you haven't
already thumbs up you guys know all that
stuff follow me on Instagram I feel like
this whole spiel that I have to tell you
guys but yeah hope you enjoyed and I'll
see you guys next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
