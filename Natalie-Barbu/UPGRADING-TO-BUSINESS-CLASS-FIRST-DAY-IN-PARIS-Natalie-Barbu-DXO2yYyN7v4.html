upgraded the start of my spring break
slash
Paris vlogs and it could not be getting
started on a worse note so this morning
I was like okay I have a lot of stuff to
do like I'm gonna shower before my 8:30
class oh I like after that I can like do
stuff I was gonna get my eyebrows done
like they really need to get done I was
gonna get my nails done cuz they're
really bad just like things that I was
like okay I can do that last minute
nobody else so then I'm going outside to
go run to target because I also needed
to buy a laptop case just because I
don't want to have my laptop kind of
just out there I don't know so I have a
laptop case and I was going to Target
and I noticed that my car was gone
so my car got towed from my reserved
parking spot because I am in my sister's
car and I guess the sheet of paper that
says was like reserved fell off
apparently and so they towed my car even
though I pay extra to park in a reserved
spot at my apartment complex so yeah
these are very puffy eyes from crying
this morning also yes I had to finish
editing the video so I had to finish
editing that and upload that like today
it's just been a really really bad day
and now I've been driving with Colin who
has been an absolute lifesaver with
driving me everywhere and like me
calling in with last-minute meekly
communicate here now I don't have a car
and so yeah it's just been great so
drive me to the airport and yeah
hopefully things don't go wrong then
it's not letting me check into my flight
though which is really freaking me out
like it's letting me check into my first
flight but like from Baltimore to London
it's not letting me check in and I don't
know why and like I swear if I miss a
flight today I'm gonna lose it because I
don't have a connecting flight I just
bought two separate tickets so like this
is on me like I don't have like
insurance for this so yeah hopefully
things go well I'll let you know I just
arrived at the Baltimore Airport and it
was like the bumpiest flight ever
the pilot even was like yeah that was so
rough like I'm so sorry you guys and
I've been on a lot of planes and that
was like super bumpy but yeah I'm like
four hours early my flight to London
doesn't leave until 7:30 and it's only
4:15 so I'm like three hours early but
yeah better to be early than message so
yeah and now I'm just waiting for my
friends to get here because they're
meeting me they drove to Baltimore
because she goes to school in Virginia
and I'm really really excited so I got
some books some magazines
I had to rego through security which I
didn't know I had to do but it was fine
and yeah also this is my carry-on and
it's like absolutely huge and barely
didn't fit on the plane but like I
really don't want to check it so they
keep letting me by but it's like a
really big carry so I doubt it'll fit on
this plane
got upgraded for free
me and actually all
we all had like we work together like I
got a greater person than she did later
linkages coincidence
really excited and prompt
guys this is the menu
I got moved next to Alden and Darby
yes
so we just got our starter it's dinner
time and it's like absent
okay so to start we all got a salad
my cheesecake is that even cheese grated
cheese and my
a glass of wine
free this is insane and I'm watching
lala land
what Who am I this is my dinner I got a
short rib I don't know what that is but
it looks like potatoes vegetables
still watching while I land
this is the light
so we arrived in Paris and I went to
John right now this is my friend John um
we are just like a really cute bakery by
his like apartment building or dorm and
he's like a little bit outside of Paris
so we're trying to catch a bus to go
into the city but yeah we just need to
stop by some coffee because I've been
awake for like 24 hours and then we're
gonna go to Paris Fashion Week so I'm
really
he was so
from the top
guys I'm with Anna and Renee here so
cold and we're not dressed for the
weather but it's really pretty it was
great so cold and honestly I thought the
first or the second floor whatever the
normal view was better game actually
passwords of parents seemed like as
windy and cold it certainly would mean
it's really cool down everyone know
French boys that we've seen just crowded
told Whitney if the weather was fine it
honestly would be like way better but
I'm just like a high school me John so I
would say make it 2-1 I'm Paris Fashion
Week so just to kind of experience it
oh I'm going to end the vlog here I
don't really remember all the footage I
got but today was a really fun and
eventful day I can't believe it's only
the first day I'm here because it feels
like I've been here for so long and I
have not slept since like the day before
I landed like I've been slept in like
almost 48 hours I don't know how long
it's been it's currently like 4 a.m.
right now but yeah we were just hanging
out and I am actually with my roommates
Anna and Renee over there and I am
staying at an Airbnb with them just
because it's the person I'm staying with
us I'm staying with John he lives like
far out of the city so I just thought
it'd be easier if I stayed with them
tonight while they were here and
yesterday was such an eventful day and I
had so much fun and I hope that you guys
enjoyed the vlog if you did please give
it a thumbs up and subscribe and I'll
see you guys tomorrow bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
