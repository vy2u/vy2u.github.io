or I'm filling this video to tell you
guys that I dyed my hair and I just
wanted to share with you guys like what
I did to it where I got a dime just like
kinda to show you guys like hey look I
dyed my hair um if you follow me on
instagram you would have seen that
already my instagrams at Natalie
underscore varville if you want to
follow me that would be very nice of you
guys and same as my Twitter um but yeah
I just got it lighter as you can tell i
feel like i'm kind of like a blonde now
I don't know like I feel like really
light and like my hair is really light
now it's definitely a difference you can
definitely tell it's different like it's
not some subtle thing like when I for
when she was blowing it out I'm just
like oh my gosh I didn't know what to
thank you know but I got done in the
salon in South Beach so south miami
beach florida it's called Sean Donaldson
the lady that did my hair was called her
name's Erica she did such a fantastic
job I recommend anyone who lives in the
south florida area to go to that salon
it is kind of pricey it's more pricey
than like a normal salon but then again
anything in miami beach is so I mean
it's not like ridiculous is like three
hunters or anything I got a hair colors
look all over highlights and a blowout
like I had another lady blow out my hair
for 195 dollars so that is expensive yes
but I get this done like every like nine
months or something the last time I got
a dad was in June or something or July
or something like that so I don't really
need to get it done that often so it's
cheaper than if you're getting done like
every six weeks or something to retouch
on your roots we obviously get closer to
the camera so you guys can see I don't
know if getting closer to the camera is
more helpful or getting far away don't
really know
um yeah okay but it's just lighter hair
color overall I really really like it
it's still kind of ombre because at the
top it's darker and I did that so I
didn't need to keep coming back to the
salon to redo it but yeah that's how it
is and i really like i got it done today
on wednesday um as you can tell i'm
extremely sunburned it looks worse on
camera that it is it doesn't really hurt
except this one shoulder hurts really
bad and there's mr. in the background
yeah and my bed sickness I really didn't
feel like cleaning it for you guys I'm
sorry I should have I didn't um but yeah
I'm just really really love my hair let
me know if you guys like it and if you
guys think it's like the ugliest thing
the world please don't tell me that
because I mean yeah I may think its
effect great or anything like that but
like it really hurts people's feelings
and you leave negative comments on there
so please like if you do I mean I guess
that's your freedom of speech you can do
whatever you want but just so you know
it does hurt people to be like so you're
not being a very nice person and there
is bullying on the internet like that is
considered like cyberbullying I guess
and just because you don't know me
personally doesn't mean that I don't
really have feelings I feel like a lot
of people think like oh she's just
someone on a computer screen I can tell
her whenever I want like you're so ugly
like oh I hate your videos you know it's
like yeah you can tell me that but at
the same time I'm still a person I'm
still reading these comments and just
think about if you were um making videos
for people and like you wanted to put
all your all into the videos and they
kind of just tore you down and like told
you how much they liked it i mean you
and kind of get discouraged so then it's
just a little like piece of advice and
that's not just for me that's for anyone
on youtube do not like leak comments on
anyone's videos or anything like that
like we're all one big community you
know and i think that we shall likes to
Kiev and stepping on it like leave
really mean comments because it does
hurt people and it's not very nice but
yeah I just wanted to show you guys my
hair and I wish I did a vlog I was going
to bring my camera to south beach and
like filming off of the day there but I
totally forgot because I had to leave
her
in the morning because it's like 45
minutes away from my place in here in
Florida and um and like I just my point
is at eleven so we had to leave pretty
early and so I just totally forgotten it
slipped my mind but yeah I hope that you
guys like my hair let me know if you
liked it and I wanted to get it done
before prom because I wanted to a her to
be very nice for prom I promise in may
so it's actually kind of quite quite
some time some of the last proms like I
think my problem has or my school has
like prom last out of like everyone but
yeah I hope that you guys like it and
I'm kind of blonds now and um yeah and I
think for the winter i'm going to go
back dark so i'm going to go back to how
i had it like it just dark all over but
for the spring and summer i really like
the light and I think that's i'm going
to do alternate i'll get my hair done
twice a year once for like the spring
once for the fall so spring and summer
it's gonna be light and then fall and
winter it's gonna be dark so yeah so if
you guys like my dark hair better well
they need the fall on the winter i will
have dark hair again by especially when
i get like really tan in the summer and
stuff I think the light hair will make
it look really better and then the sun's
gonna lay like lightening up and stuff
like that but oh my god I almost had a
hard time for a second because I didn't
think it was filming I was gonna be so
mad okay but yeah I really hope you guys
like it let me know what you think
please only like positive comments or no
comments at all that's like what I'm
trying to go for so yeah everyone has a
great day I have a great spring break
and see you guys later bye oh and if you

spring lookbook video and my spring
makeup tutorial video my spring makeup

be wearing it so much and I really hope
you guys like it and I'm not wearing
like any makeup right now I'm wearing
