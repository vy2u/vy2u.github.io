looking at you I can't ever be paid cuz
you hey everyone so I am actually in my
sister's room right now and I am in a
robe I'm over my clothes because it's
really cozy but I'm just doing a little
intro on my macbook because I didn't
feel like bringing out the camera but um
the intro is that I did go to the One
Direction concert this in Durham North
Carolina about a week ago and I just
found my camera cuz I like a lost it for
a little bit so I just found my camera
recently and I'm putting together the
vlog for you guys and FYI just so you
know it's not that good a vlog because
we didn't get to meet them which we were
like really really hoping for we were
waiting outside in the freezing cold for
about three hours and then my mom
started getting really pissed off and
she started getting like really angry
and because it was like three hours away
from our house and it was already like
eleven o'clock at night and so she was
getting like really mad like they're
never gonna come out love of launches a
yelling at me and trust me guys if it
was me if I was driving I would have
stayed there till five in the morning if
it took to meet them but like they
weren't coming out like any time soon so
my mom so getting like really angry so
we had to leave um but yeah I did not
meet them but I do have some vlogs of
like me my friend the car meet my friend
at the place me my friend at the concert
like yeah and then I have like a few
videos of them and like singing and the
videos of them singing are kind of short
because like in most of them you can
hear me like belting at the top of my
lungs their songs and not gonna lie I am
literally like the worst singer in the
world like I'm not kidding like I am so
bad and I didn't want to like embarrass
myself to the whole worldwide internet
so I just decided to not add those
singing me parts in it because I may
sound so bad and it's like ridiculous
and you can barely hear them so you can
only hear my screens but yeah um so I
didn't include those but I didn't click
like
what I could it's not that long of a
vlog it's yeah not that long at all so
I'm very sorry and I really try to if
like if we met them this vlog would be
perfect but we did not meet them
obviously so it's not the greatest long
but I promise you guys I would do and so
I just did on for you guys anyway but
yeah I'm just gonna get started in this
video because you probably don't want to
hear me talking in my robe so yeah I
will talk to you guys later and also
don't forget to ask me questions from my
little ask Natalie sentiment um because
i am doing like this ask natalie thing
if he doesn't know about that um so yeah
i will talk to you guys later and now
