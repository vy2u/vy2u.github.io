blog today and I'm getting my hair dyed
today so I'm going a lot lighter so it's
gonna be a lot different than what you
see now as you can tell like when I'm
wearing my head in the head or in a hair
tie like all of this is just really
really dark and I don't want that and
then like my ends are super light so
like I kind of want to steer lies in the
arm right but still kind of keep it just
so I don't sleep after that long but I
mainly just want likeness like all over
so I'm so excited to show you guys but
anyways right now i just thought i would
show you guys my outfit that I'm wearing
to the hair salon I'm in Miami right now
which is where I get my hair done which
a lot of you are going to be like wow
you're so spoiled to the Miami to get
your hair done it's like I don't go here
to get my hair done but I get my hair
done here that makes sense like we have
an apartment here I'm from here
originally so we're always here and i
only get my hair done like three times a
year and we came to Miami at least three
times a year so it just ends up picking
out so anyways i'm just going to show
you guys my outfit so here's my outfit
of the day so i am wearing this tank top
from free people that i actually got for
twelve dollars it's a really nice basic
tank top and i really like the high
neckline then i am wearing just my
victoria secret kind of like lace
bralette underneath just because you
can't really wear a normal bra with this
then i am wearing this uh here I'll show
you guys this necklace which is really
pretty it's from j.crew it's actually my
mom's but i really like it and it just
adds like some color to it then these
pants are from american eagle it's
really dark in this room by their dark
purple and they I feel like a latta and
then they're just like big like like I
don't know how to explain i like just
big like jumpy pants and then they send
an ankle and then i'm wearing these lace
up sandals so
yep and I've got my outfit of the day
and of course i have my burberry purse
um this is my favorite person ever it
was a splurge but I'm sure you guys have
seen it in a lot of other videos let me
know if you guys want a what's in my
purse video thumbs it up if you do I'll
about made one in it like three years
like if i have a link down on below or
just put right here a picture of my what
is in my first video it is so
embarrassing I was like so like this is
wrong but I was just like so up with
anything rose just thank but anyways
let's just get started with the what's
in my back part of this sheet of this
video first I'm going to start with my
wallet this is ali wala park hey
everyone so i am driving to
and I just wanted to show you guys
basically what i'm showing that it was a
lot of how I want to do my hair so here
i have my surface travel it down here
and we're just driving on the highway
and so here it is and i just go to
photos and kind of dark so i don't know
if you guys can see kind of a glare but
this is basically what I'm trying to
achieve eventually I know my hair is
like really dark so it will be hard in
the beginning but well yeah so if you
guys can see that it's just like pretty
blonde and i'm just sitting in the car
and if you guys want to play me on
trivia crack i really like this game my
username is at Natalie Natalie so it's
just my name repeated twice but yeah so
let's see let's play against my brother
I'm winning by a lot
I went school to Tim Brown win the
heisman trophy in 1987 um i'm just gonna
guess USC okay nope no idea who Tim
Brown was
alright this looks like a commercial
purpose
so we're on lincoln road and we're just
getting at this yummy italian restaurant
before i get my hair done so i was
saying the food looks like it's like
from a commercial or something
so i just got finished dyeing my hair
you guys can tell i'm hopefully you can
know it's a lot lighter and whatever you
wash it just fades out more so it's
gonna look even better after I wash it a
couple times but I really love it is I
haven't really gonna chance to fully
look at it yet so but um yeah so I just
let me know what you think in the
comments below and I will see you guys
