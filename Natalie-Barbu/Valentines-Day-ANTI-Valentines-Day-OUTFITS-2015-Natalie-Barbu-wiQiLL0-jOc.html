valentine's day outfit video and i'm
showing you three very different outfits
so please stay tuned so you can kind of
see which outfits i picked out for you
and i'm pretty sure they go with any
type of style that you have so the first
one is a tulle skirt romance as i like
to call it it is a really really goofy
but cute tulle skirt i actually got it
from windsor and tulle skirts i've been
noticing are really in style I follow a
lot of fashion blogs and they all have
them of course when we don't wear them
on a daily basis but I just thought this
would be so cute valentine's day if
you're going out with your boyfriend and
you kind of want to dress up or even if
you're just going out with girlfriends
and you guys kind of want to have a tea
party inspired today I just thought that
this outfit would be super cute I have
kind of a fuzzy letter a cropped sweater
on from winter I think crop sweaters are
the way to go with this just because it
is a high-waisted skirt so both of them
are from winter and then my shoes I just
hear some great feels not really sure
where they're from i'm pretty sure it's
from schumann hope i don't want to give
you false information but any just kind
of feels open toe feels I think with
work for this I definitely think you
need feels if you're short like me and
then I just kind of have a heart
necklace on and yeah that is that outfit
so that's kind of a more costly one if
you guys like that this next one is
actually was really fun to film it was
an anti valentine's day one so i know a
lot of girls and that don't have
boyfriends and they really liked wearing
kind of all black and just kind of
having a girls night and I'm just kind
of against Valentine's Day which is
totally fine defensive thing so I just
had a memory matron up and build this we
just kind of just up and I'm doing a lot
of black and
talking about my day and really what
we're talking about like voice that
sounds sick I'm beginning to me really
not what I'm talking about if you want
to stay tuned to the end I gotta have a
hip behind secondly I can see what we
said um but yeah so I just kind of done
this at a starbucks and some story we
actually got out of filming property but
hey I pick up so yeah I'm wearing this
really big flannel from winter and then
I have a black buggin scarf from urban
outfitters and my shoes are from target
and that's such a simple outfit and I
where the fat on a normal basis but if
you kind of want to became a balance and
say all blasting Ivan this is perfect
because it's totally not when you're
gonna clean out the restaurant with
coffee shops and then my purse is from
Topshop I have a picture of it on my
Instagram if you guys want to see that
this last alpha is a date night outfit
so this is what a lot of girls will
probably be wearing something similar to
this for not your about all day I don't
know what I'm wearing yet to comment
below which is your favorite this is
kind of you have a boyfriend or even if
you don't but you kind of want to go to
a nice restaurant help this is something
i would recommend you're wearing it's
really really cute very flirty and it
kind of has the chain of elements that
hangs with
annoying and overwhelming cuz i really
don't like wearing that much right pink
on especially for even in the Phnom
Penh's day so I'm just wearing a duty of
9 Palmer a sweater with a skirt and some
uncle Mitchell but yeah I just have to
pin a target and it's called a funny
story again we got kicked out of and
this is lava for film insurance again
it's kind of property which I did not
know I have this much trouble for use
video for you guys but um yeah I'm just
wearing these high socks hanging freely
and really bothers me that they're not
so then but I noticed it afterwards and
then this skirt that's from a Windsor
which is a very flirty and actually slow
letter which that's why I got it and
then this fall break butter from j.crew
that I got like four years ago you're
probably not going to have it so jumpy
you guys at the picture and then in
chain at Perth which I have no idea
where it's pearl oh I'm so sorry guys I
don't know where crap but anyways if you
guys have been to target you guys have
skinny and old chocolate roses you guys
I'm really really long one so if you
guys want to buy any one you know use
your brain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
