vlogmas
and I'm walking out of my apartment
right now I'm going to work on a group
project and I already finished my
classes actually it's December 1st but
I'm going to work on a group project
right now I look very gross I'm also
very very late most opposed to be there
30 minutes ago and I'm just now walking
there so um yeah very stressful be
getting a vlogmas oh how you only be
working on that today but let's see
whatever else I can flog so this is the
real life of a college student very
stressed out and always late let me know
if you guys relate actually I'm gonna
take the elevator no I'm not taking the
stairs I've got my coffees to go running
late to my group project and I have so
many great products trains actually
insane um yeah I'm so shut out so week
before final so everyone's kind of like
this yeah so we were working on a linear
programming project this is where we
work so that's my friend Amy that's my
friend Tochi then we went to Chipotle we
actually filmed some shots for my video
project there he is acting and just
walking along the street
feel like I have not logged all day
because I've just been doing my project
so that's why I feel like vlogmas is
kind of hard for college students
because around this time it's just like
exams finals ton of projects which is
why I actually have not uploaded a video
last week that's why because I had so
many projects so I feel like I haven't
blogged that much lately so I'm really
talking about that um but I just can't
vlog it with my projects cuz we're
trying to get work done in everyone's
stressed and if I'm just like hey guys
like let me pull up my camera everyone's
gonna be like what are you doing like
you're so annoying we're trying to work
kind of difficult um but I just worked
on my projects all day like I said a
million times and it we finally finished
we actually have a video left to do so
I'm gonna film a video for my project
and then yeah I might combine two of the
vlogs together because obviously I'm not
doing that much today happy vlogmas let
me know what videos you guys want to see
for christmas time because i'm gonna do
some gift guides and stuff like that but
let me know what other videos that you
guys want to see and I will film those
for you
and
it's gonna be a super fun vlog because
I'm actually being a photographer for a
fashion show at my school I'm so beyond
excited to film that and to be just like
a photographer that for that so I'm
excited hello people we are at nothing
for not double noodles noodles and
company right now I'm with Collin who
came to visit me in Raleigh you guys
never really know that I have a
boyfriend because I don't show him in a
lot of videos but it's my boyfriend by
the way I will show him in a second
like right here with me we're deciding
on our food really extremely extremely
hungry and I'm trying to get more used
to like blogging in public and like
looking at the lens instead of myself up
there so this is great practice and even
if people see me like whatever
roll out I can tell Collins what kind of
uncomfortable but it's okay it's not
focusing look it's all blurry
Collin how is your food I just need my
key get
all right and we also have cheesy garlic
bread Caesar salad
I got mac and cheese and tomato bisque
soup yeah good morning you guys so it is
December 2nd so technically day 2 of
lockness just woke up and I actually
have a presentation today at 12:50 so
I'd like an hour and a half and I'm just
getting ready but I just made myself
some avocado toast it's so good I'm
absolutely obsessed about Mikado Cho's
let me show you guys so good so I have
just sourdough bread
avocados black peppers olive oil and
salt and it is just amazing and then I
have my youtube water bottle drinking
some water also staying hydrated with
some orange juice over there just a good
breakfast really good breakfast
presentation about this I am about to
head out and do my presentation um it
starts in a little bit I have to go uh
yeah it's a great presentation so I'm
not too worried about it I am really
really tired though and I just like hate
dressing up so I'm wearing this like
it's not I'm not even dressing up I just
like don't know how to look professional
I feel like and I don't know what if
it's like too professional he didn't
really tell us like what's where so I'm
wearing this just like black jacket it's
like a little more casual and then I
have this suede top and a free people
necklace and this top is like pockets on
the side it's really cute and I'm
wearing this along a plaid skirt so it
looks like pretty professional to me I
guess I have my coffee for the day I
feel like a businesswoman um just
kidding I don't know sometimes when I
feel like I'm like on the go and I'm a
mission to do and like I had like my
coffee in my hand I just feel like
really professional I don't know I know
it's super super weird but yes I wish me
luck guys let you know how it goes and
yeah oh my god laying in my bed right
