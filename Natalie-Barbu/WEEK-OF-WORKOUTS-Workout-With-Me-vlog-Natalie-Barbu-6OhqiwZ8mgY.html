start of my workout with me for a whole
week video I've seen these floating
around lately and a lot of you guys have
been asking me to do workout videos so I
figured I would start doing a workout
with me for a week
just so that you guys can see everything
that I do Monday through Friday I try to
work out five times a week six is
pushing it normally it's four it's just
anywhere from like four to six times a
week but this week I am determined to do
Monday through Friday just because
living in LA I've kind of been slacking
just because it's a new place people
have been visiting me I haven't been
doing the best today's Monday morning
and I'm with Ali and we she's right
there we are about to go hiking so we're
going to Runyon Canyon Park I've done
this hike before so fun such a good
workout especially because it's like a
slower pace like it's not high-intensity
so I really like it but it's long enough
thing you still get a workout in today I
am wearing this Nike sports bra very
classic Nike and then these Lululemon
leggings and I haven't put my shoes on
yet they're just gonna be some grey
Nikes but yeah this is gonna be the
workout outfits I was also gonna go to
the gym today but I was like you know I
know the hike is enough
all right guys excuse me morning and I'm
headed to the gym it's almost 10:00 a.m.
right now so I'm gonna go do that but I
just want to show you guys my workout
outfit going to the gym in a denim
jacket cuz I shower there just cuz it's
like a really nice shower and they have
shampoo and conditioner and like body
wash for you so I'm just going in like
this so that I can wear this afterwards
and then I have this sports bra from
forever 21 and just my Lululemon
leggings if this is the outfit just
all-black and then my grey and pink Nike
shoes
it's Wednesday morning you guys and I'm
off to do some hot yoga this morning so
I am going to the gym and I'm gonna do a
hot vinyasa class and I haven't done
this one before at this gym so I'm
really excited I haven't done yoga in so
long and yoga is probably honestly like
one of my favorite workouts if not my
favorite workout to do I just love it I
my body feels so good afterwards I feel
so refreshed like it is such a good
workout I am wearing this like long tank
sports bra I love sports bras like this
because I don't have to wear a shirt I
really never wear a shirt anyways but
this makes me feel less self-conscious
these are from two exist I got them at
an event so I'm not a hundred percent
sure like where to get them but they are
the brand to exist this sports bra is
super dry I absolutely love it it's like
one of my favorite sports rods
especially if you're small chested like
me and I'm just wearing Burks cuz I'm
doing yoga so I don't need it where
sneakers or anything like that I am so
happy I'm going to this yoga class
seriously so pumped I haven't gone in so
long I probably won't be able to get any
footage of me actually inside the class
and because again it's yoga I don't want
to disrupt the flow I guess and there's
other people in the class that I don't
want them being annoyed that I brought
my camera but I would try bringing it
inside the studio to see if there's any
moment that I can but it was already
awkward enough at the gym yesterday
belonging is so crossing my fingers that
I can but if not I'll try to get as many
like cool shots at the gym
I just finished my yoga class and I
showered at the gym because the gym
shower here is so much nicer than mine
in my apartment I got a smoothie this is
the slim down it's only like 280
calories or something but still has
protein in it so it wasn't as hard as my
usual hot yoga classes are I've never
been to the one at this gym I'm gonna
try other instructors too I really
really liked it but I really wish that
it was a little more challenging I
overheard her talking and she was saying
how like last week's class people
complained that it was too hard so she
tried making this one easier and like no
girl we're here to work like make it
hard for us I'll see you swim it is now
Thursday morning and I am going to my
personal training session this is a free
personal training session since I just
joined the gym this month so that is one
of the things that they offer this is
the outfits of the gym day outfit at the
gym I don't know does that make sense
this sports bra is from Victoria's
Secret pink these are my favorite sports
rods they are so cute and flattering I
think and then my pants are from
fabletics they're just cute little
leggings I really wish they were
high-waisted because I don't have any
workout tank tops here so I've literally
just been working out in sports bras and
leggings and then here I have my Nike
tennis shoes which I live
I'm done with a personal training
session and I had showered and got ready
at the gym
I literally loved the shower at my dream
alike I would go they're not even
working out just a shower it was so good
if any of you guys want to contact
Lindsey which was the personal trainer
today I'm gonna have her Instagram down
below because she does fitness videos on
there and I'm also gonna have her email
down below just so that you guys could
check her out if you guys are in the LA
area she's so sweet and like she knows
what she's talking about it's just a
really good like full body workout and
it's a lot of moves that I've never done
before because I feel like I kind of get
stuck in like a same pattern like I get
stuck in a routine and I don't really
branch out from that so that was
something that I like really really
really really loved and so I'll have her
stop at the ladies down below
happy Friday you guys it is the last day
of this weekly workouts I'm uploading
this video today so this is what I
looked like this morning if you guys are
watching it first right now I'm about to
go to the gym and today I'm just gonna
do some cardio so I think I'm going to
do just the stair stepper and maybe
something else I'm not know how to
present sure I kind of feel like I want
to get a good workout in though but I'll
see once I get there
this is my outfit of the day or a
workout outfit of the day so I'm just
wearing the sports bra again it's from
pink these are like my favorite style
sports bras I just think they're so
flattering these leggings are from
fabletics again I really like fabletics
leggings they're cheap and they're also
good I just wish they were higher
waisted I know some Styles obviously you
could get higher waisted but I wish like
these specific ones were higher waisted
and I'm wearing it my Nike ray shoes
hopefully you guys enjoyed this workout
week in my life or weekly workouts I
don't really know what to call this
really hope you guys liked this video I
want to feel more of these for you so
comment down below if you guys want to
feel more of these or if you guys just
want me to do like a dedicated workout
like if any of those were your favorite
and you want me to do like a whole video
just on that one workout let me know I
wanted to make this disclaimer I am NOT
a personal trainer I'm not a fitness
coach I don't really know much about it
other than just what I've researched on
my own you don't have any like actual
education on it so these are just what I
do and what keeps me fit and what keeps
me motivated in my fitness journey the
reason why I do these workouts one it is
yes to look better I guess like
obviously I feel like a lot of people
they start working out because they want
to lose weight or they want to get toned
and they just want to look good but I'm
telling you guys once you start your
fitness journey and once you start
working out actually actively and it
becomes part of your daily routine
you just start to feel such a change
like you feel happier you feel more
energetic you start working out because
of the way you feel not necessarily
because though you look the way you look
is an added bonus I'm not saying I don't
care about the way I look at all because
that's not true either but for me it
seriously is such a mental thing and
it's so worth it and the endorphins are
real you guys so I just want you guys to
know that and I want to encourage you
guys to definitely start yours if you're
looking for a sign this is it and let me
know if you guys like this video and
I'll see you guys next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
