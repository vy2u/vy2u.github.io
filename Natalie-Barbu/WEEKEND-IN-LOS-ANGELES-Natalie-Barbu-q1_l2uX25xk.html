Alfred's and honestly very disappointed
super below average coffee like nothing
special honestly my Starbucks right now

iced vanilla latte which I am also
getting now and at alfred's that was
like over $5 because I got a shot of
vanilla in it and like come on like it
was not that good I'm sorry but yeah so
can I just say that I'm really really
excited that Natalie's here and I'm good

Miami Florida beaches and this is so
different and so nice like I'm on a
beach but I'm looking at the mountain
like she was crying we got here and I
was like it's so nice like I guess Miami

little bit enjoying the beautiful
weather and I'm like perfectly so
perfect and like where I'm from the
hurricane is hitting cuz I'm from North
Carolina it's like the hurricane is

say thank you not for coming and I told
her to turn the camera well thanks Steph
