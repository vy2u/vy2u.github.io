of the day two of my blog and currently
I just had breakfast and I am uploading
a video and I had it uploading while
we're at breakfast and then came back
upstairs to see if it was uploaded and
the sharing failed because I don't know
if it's my Wi-Fi or if it's my laptop
but every time I don't use my computer
like the Wi-Fi just shuts off um I don't
know but that's a way to like conserve
battery or conserve anything but it
needs to stop because this always
happens and yeah so now i have to
reupload it but i don't want to leave my
computer because then it's not going to
upload and this is a sponsored video so
i need it today to be uploaded and it's
just really really frustrating but yeah
I'm just really frustrated so if you
guys know of any solutions to do that or
you guys know any way to look just like
have your upload go super quickly
because it always takes me like at least
an hour to upload a video which is
really annoying let me know
Naomi would you like to be in it my
cousin you guys I just an anthropology
right now it's like a really really
pretty one they're all pretty but
we're just going to locate cuz we can't
really afford thank you sir but I mean
it'd be nice candle smell goods candle
smell very good very good it's so
awkward walking in public demands like
might have a camera pointed to your face
my beard is so common though we are at
Fisherman's Wharf right now and I
haven't been blogging that much today
honestly today is not in the best day
not gonna lie it's just been like I
don't know I've been in kind of a bad
mood you know those days and you're just
in an awful mood yeah that's kind of
mean but it's still really nice and
that's why I haven't been walking that
much but just wanted to be honest with
you guys but I still want to show you
everything so like if you've never been
here you can still see it obviously it's
not the same yeah just want to show you
guys lunch with a view
that probably won't open it yeah really
really good young gonna go hang out in a
friend Ariana who moved up here to Santa
Cruz yeah would you like the food so we
are at ghirardelli square right now and
it is actually freezing like i'm so sick
i'm pretty sure i have developed like
strep throat or something which would
not be uncommon for me just because I
always get strep throat but yeah the
coal definitely weakens my already weak
immune system and it is so windy and I
can feel my like what are these called
lymph nodes getting more swollen and the
wind blows
yeah we might hopefully leave samples go
a day early I really like the city but
like it's too cold for me so hopefully
we can leave early get a day extra in LA
that would be fun it's a lot warmer
there and I am NOT a cold-weather person
like at all not so hopefully we can do
that and my phone is also dying and like
up meeting of the night friend and it's
just just trying to get things I guess I
found a last resort I am plugging my
phone into whatever is lighting up the
tree my phone into a tree so thank yew
tree action there it is beautiful

the second or third day and we are

cute town its kind of looks like a movie

gallery here in caramel caramel it's
really pretty it's like this little
garden and i will show you guys my
outfit ok so i am wearing
my shop is from urban outfitters like a
flowy top this under top thing it's like
little cropped and it is from free
people and I liked it it's like the
straps were different I don't know I
lived it for some reason
jeans they're just wrecked plane jeans
so like I said it's like nothing special
but yeah that's all I'm wearing today I
just feel really sick so I really don't
feel like filming an alpha even though
this would have been the perfect spot to
film one I just don't feel like it so oh
we are at the beach right now and I
actually didn't want to go um so I'm
just like sitting in the car I know
unlime but I actually wanted to address
the events that happened this weekend I
didn't address it earlier I don't know
why but the dallas shooting of the
police officers happened and then the
two shootings of the black males by
white police officers happened this
weekends and um it's just I want to make
a video kind of on I don't know what I
want to do a video on and you know what
to say i do send my condolences and
prayers out to all the people affected
in this to all the people hurting to all
the people that feel unsafe it's just a
really sad situation that's going on and
it's just really really sad violence is
never the answer in any case people
should not be overstepping their power
or their authority in any way especially
life-threatening ones um I think we just
kind of need some change and clearly
like what we're doing now is I'm working
but yeah I just wanted to address that
and just kind of say that I am praying
for the families affected and for the
people affected even if you're not
family or if you even if you didn't know
the victims like I feel like this is
affected so many people and people
should just never feel unsafe and
I don't know it's just really a sad
situation and I have a lot of opinions
and I had a lot of things like in my
head and I'm reading so many facebook
posts and watching so many videos and
it's just exhausting at how many people
are so like you don't have to be on two
opposite sides you don't have to be anti
one thing and pro one thing you can be
pro two things like you don't need to be
all pro one thing but yeah I just want
to let you guys know and I'm praying for
the ones affected hey guys so I am here
like maybe two weeks after my trip to
California and I'm editing the vlogs
because I upload them so late and I
didn't end this one again but I do have
a good reason for that so I'm just gonna
like tell you a little mini story time
in the middle of this vlog and on my
really crappy laptop camera so hope you
guys are cool with that um so basically
what happened is we got to Santa Barbara
that day and my favorite city ever so
jealous if you live there and I started
getting like we went to in and out at
night and I was feeling really sick if
you can't tell by how many times I say I
feel so sick and it's cold in this blog
because I say that a lot so I was
feeling really sick and I we had in and
out and I couldn't even finish my burger
which you know is sign that I'm sick
because like one burgers are my favorite
food too it's in and out like Natalie
come on you can finish your burger so
that's how you knew I was sick so I was
feeling really sick and um we got to the
hotel and I kid you not like on the way
to the hotel I thought I was about to
throw up I was just feeling so nauseous
so I thought was gonna throw up so then
I went to the hotel the second we got
there I went to the bathroom and I just
like sat on the toilet sorry TMI I don't
know and I just was like needing to
throw up or something needed to happen
where I could empty my stomach and so
then we got up to the hotel room and I
didn't do anything in there and I got up
to the hotel room and I lied down and I
was just like I'm gonna I'm gonna throw
up so I went to the bathroom and I threw
up and I threw up from there that night
I threw up I think about 15 times in a
period of like two hours
15 times then I had the most intense
stomach pains I couldn't move I couldn't
breathe I just felt like I was dying I
felt unbelievably bad like i was i was
crying I I just didn't know what to do I
tried having water I tried having some
gatorade because i felt dehydrated after
throwing up so many times I had it was
just so bad I every time I like had
water I would throw up so that's why I
was like okay I literally can't put
anything in my stomach so then we went I
just was feeling so bad like i was
saying and so I my parents were like
okay you need to go to the hospital so
he went to the only Hospital in Santa
Barbara which I'm so shocked there's
only one like Charlotte North Carolina
which is what I live has like five
hospitals and santa barbara california
has one that's so weird so I went to the
only Hospital in Santa Barbara and I was
there and they treated me we thought it
was like appendicitis but it wasn't I
think it was just something with I
forgot what they said they gave it a
term but they gave me um they gave me
some I found what they gave me I don't
know what they gave me but they gave me
all this sort of thing and so yeah the
next day in Santa Barbara I did not blog
at all because I stayed in the car the
whole time meet my family went to
California Pizza Kitchen I slept I slept
I slept on my mom's lap in california
pizza kitchen i'm a 20 year old woman
and i slept on my mom's lap like what
okay so yeah that happened and I just
stated the car after that me whole
entire time sleeping and throwing up and
it was very good so that's just a story
of why I didn't end the vlog and so yeah
