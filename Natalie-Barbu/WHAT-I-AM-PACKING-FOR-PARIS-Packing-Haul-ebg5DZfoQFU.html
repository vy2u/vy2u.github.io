different start to a video because it is
kind of vlog style but across the video
is a vlog style my mic actually quit
working so when I went to edit last
night it just wasn't working for like
two minutes of the video and this video
is also a collab so the part where I
film the intro with Ally
it wasn't working so but the good news
is the rest of the video and the video
where I actually show the hall and what
I got somehow the audio was there so
thank God for that
it helped me freak out a little last
isms and I get like midnight last night
this is just an intro it's like the vlog
style of it I guess but also I want to
say thank you for an adore me for
sponsoring this video
and for sending me some French little
goodies from them so when I was picking
out my stuff I made sure everything was
very like paris-themed
because that is obviously what I'm
packing for and if you guys sign up for
adore me please use my code I will have
that down below you guys also get your
first set for only $25 so it's super
super cheap because a bra and underwear
at Victoria's Secret is like $50 for
just a bra and at adore me it's only 25
for a matching one and if you guys know
me I mentioned it a lot of times I'm
very weird about matching my underwear
in my bra I don't always do it but I
really like it and I feel like they're
pretty and very I don't know I just feel
myself when I'm matching my bra in my
underwear so I really like that it comes
in a set and you get it for $25 and you
don't need to have a membership or
anything like that but if you want check
out the link down below I know you guys
like adore me I've worked on a lot of
other times and now I'm just going to
kind of start in the video where I start
pulling out my very first thing somehow
the audio works the first item that I
showed so I'm so happy about that so
yeah going back to a few days ago and so
the first thing that I got for me is a
row
and if this doesn't scream Paris and I
don't know what does I I'm obsessed I
love it so much it's really really soft
if you guys know me I'm a huge Road
person so I love that adore me South
ropes just because I know that they're
reliable and they're affordable and I
every time I wear robes in my videos
like just like my blogs or anything you
have to ask me so I have like the purple
one and stuff that's also from adore me
so they have a lot of rooms I really
like it
the next thing is very very Paris like
everything I got is Paris because I kept
that in mind so it is this really cute
pajama set that I will be wearing one of
the nights and it's pink and purple and
pastel colors and the back is actually
open and it's just really really cute I
think I love this and then the bottoms
are just like flowy shorts so I just
like wearing really cute PJs I always do
if I don't want a t-shirt I will wear
cute PJs but since I have a lot of cute
ones I can't write notes as much as I
can and when I'm on vacation I always
taxi one the next set of PJs is like
french maid I feel like so it is this
pink and black tank top with ruffles at
the bottom and then the back is actually
black and then B shorts are like these
little French matey
type shorts so yeah I love it as a pump
the next thing I got is this bra and I
will not be trying this on unlike
everything else but I got this really
really cute bra and it's just really
pretty it's white and it has like grey
Pan lace at the bottom and also there's
a bow and I just think it's so so cute
and then I got me matching underwear to
go with it so next I got another set of
matching underwear and bra and this is
the underwear actually so it looks super
weird because it's one of those that it
hugs your hip in like two ways hum your
hips in like two ways and I think it's
just really really cool so this is what
this underwear looks like bra that I
don't kind of know how to put it on I
just kind of like on took it out of the
box it's a black lace bra this is one of
the triangles I can tell but yeah so
trying to work
but look here with you on the model so
I'm going to go with it and then the
next thing I got some rare with actually
one of my dresses that I'm wearing in
Paris is these types so I love types I
think they just make any outfit look a
little more classy and so I just got
some sheer tights I just like you adore
me yesterday's lingerie yes it is bras
and underwear and that's their main
focus but that's not the only thing that
they have because I don't I would not
want a membership just for bras and
underwear
I like the membership because I can get
other things like PJs robes tights like
all these things and just kind of not
feel bad because it's not that expensive
and you can just like carry over the
month-to-month thing so if one month you
don't want something oh well but the
next month you can get like three things
because it carry it over so yeah and you
don't need a membership also you can
also just buy these things individually
they're just more expensive but you
don't need a membership and then I got
these PJ's so I actually have these in
black because I love them so much but I
have this hot pink tank top super super
cute I never wear color so I thought it
was necessary and then I've got this
bonds with it like it's really
comfortable and I've actually worn these
out like I'm wear the black ones out
like with the normal outfit I Lee dress
them out by point he'll go on with these
pj pants um like a leather jacket I
don't know it was it was you know so it
was a look senator what I got for from
adore me so if you guys want to check
them out I highly suggest it I love all
their stuff and everything I've got this
is not my first video with them I just
absolutely love them so yeah be sure to
check out the links down below and now
for the actual clothing that I'm wearing
to parent or saying I want to show is
this dress and I'm pretty sure I'm going
to wear this to Fashion Week but I have
not decided yet
I just have to get it altered in from
Windsor and you guys know I love Windsor
it's a high neck and it is a low back
with sleet like little spaghetti straps
but I know that it's cold so I'm
planning on layering like a thick
sweater underneath it and it looks
really good I just kind of have to alter
it and it's just super long in this
little yellow mustard color I this is
totally out of my comfort zone I never
wear yellow especially like this was
bright bright bold yellow but I feel
like I need to start branching out and
this colors are in I've been seeing it
everywhere lately so yeah I'm definitely
going to be wearing stuff and if you
guys want all
these links I just thought all this
stuff this came in like this week so I
will have everything rinses down below
for you and then again with Jack I'm
wearing this leather jacket so this is
from forever 21 and I'm obsessed I wore
this in New York as well it's just a
really good thick jacket and I was so
impressed with the quality forever till
we wanted stepping up their game and it
is so amazing it's so good
humid snakes it's going to keep me warm
it has faux fur on the hood and around
the collar and it's just like it's like
metal detailing and I just think it's
like the cutest thing and I'm so
impressed with representing one's
quality like Robins he bent over 20
lines this stuff is awesome the next
thing that I got from Windsor is this
shirt and you guys this is like a mix of
like Taylor Swift and France all in one
so it is this off-the-shoulder
long-sleeve shirt that kind of like
crosses on the front and it's black and
white stripes which is my absolute
favorite so I'm so excited with this I
feel like I need like a beret like one
of those like hash to wear this and like
be eating a new crepes which underneath
the Eiffel Tower like when I wear this
shirt so this is certainly going to be
like my Eiffel Tower trip shirt I think
I'm so laying I'm like planning my
outfits based on where I'm going then
the next thing that I am wearing to
Paris or you're up I'm not sure if all
these will be in Paris because I don't
have that many days there but just in
Europe in general is this sweatshirt
obsessed with it I think I'm going to
wear this on the first day because I'm
going to be so tired because we're
taking a red-eye flight we get there in
the morning but it's really going to be
like two o'clock in the morning for me
when really it's going to be like 9:00
for Paris time so yeah I'm just going to
be exhausted I fly out from Baltimore
and then I'm like flying to Baltimore
and then from Baltimore to London and
London to Paris so it's going to be a
day it's going to be a fun day
but this sweatshirt I will probably wear
them and it is really cute as I'm going
to hold them it kind of reminds me like
a easy fashion um just like reminds me
of that because I have so many holes and
it's a little over science I actually
got a prom dress from Windsor you guys I
know I'm not going to problem I'm a
junior in college but I love filming my
prom makeup tutorials so the day I get
back from France I am filming that video
for you because that
just so excited so in like a week and a
half or two weeks get ready for that
video I'm so excited
the next thing that I've got from
Windsor is this shirt it's kind of like
a rock and roll piece but no this is not
one of those so soft about this is like
brandy melville before they split their
material level soft like this is such a
soft shirt I'm obsessed
oh my gosh I just wanna wear this to bed
or all day but yeah it's a great t-shirt
with kind of like a cool graphic design
on it and it has just short sleeve but
they're like super loose and then I have
holes at the bottom and it's like ripped
up so I'm going to be wearing these like
leggings or skinny jeans or ripped jeans
or something just to kind of a cool
casual you know maybe over that in
London with this leather jacket and then
another thing we are planning on going
out it's like a turtleneck dress and
it's gray and tights but not too short
or anything like that and I'll be
wearing this with tights and my leather
jacket less clothing a piece that I got
is this shirt and it is so cute you guys
so it's quarter sleeve and it kind of
like those up a quarter of the way hence
the name quarter sleeve hats is like
embroidered rose flower detail so
beautiful you guys and I think I'm going
to wear this in nice because that's like
the Mediterranean side of France my
water and yeah so I think I'm going to
wear that than that but I'm really
excited I think it's so like it's
perfect look I love it and then I can
hang out from Windsor you guys are you
ready for this are these boots I love
them like soul my gosh they have this
embroidered detail on they feel pardon
my nails they're really bad I'm getting
them done tomorrow but yeah it's
embroidered detail on the heels and
they're just the classic black booties
that I love and I wear every single day
but they got this so it's like a million
times cuter and I don't care if they
have this and everyone knows that I will
be rearing these every single day but
like I love these I just really really
love high heels black booties I wear
that all the time my boyfriend actually
always makes fun of me because I have
with 20 pairs of black shoes and wear
the same heels flash suit easy way that
seems like oh those again they're
literally broken like the heel is broken
and I still wear them because I love
them so much and if the next thing is
accessory
BAM how cool I look you guys I've always
wanted these mirrored sunglasses and
they're kind of like cooler because
they're more like the cat eye and yeah

sunglasses or not make sunglasses fake
glasses and I'm they're like really
really big but I think they're kind of
cool and they're like cute in pictures

Europe like on the streets but I really
like them I think they're just like add
a different touch to your outfit so yeah
and without the lights it kind of looks
cool like yeah you can see the ring
light but and last but not least I got
just earrings from Windsor I'm planning
on wearing these with the yellow maxi
