from there everyone asked what I eat in

the Kaela meal plan because I did say I
used to do they can't let bikini Bonnie
guide I never followed the meal plan and
I still vote so this will be something
different but yeah I'm about to go to
the gym just thought I would let you
guys know that so I just woke up and I
am about to go straight to the gym I
normally if I go to the gym right after
I wake up I eat afterwards because I
don't like eating before I go to the gym
unless I have time because I try to wait
at least 30 minutes just because it's
not I feel sick I just want to have my
food digest properly so yeah I'm going
right away I'm going going for about 30
to 45 minutes and then I'm getting
breakfast my fine jewelry and we're
going to make some breakfast at her
apartment so yeah that is the first step
of my day so I take about two of these a
day it's just from Target they're
women's multivitamins I thought I should
let you guys know I used to never take
vitamins but I just bought this recently
and I'm not like noticing anything but
they're obviously good for you so yep I
just go back to the gym so that is why
my face is really red and bloody um but
I won't let you guys know make sure you
drink plenty of water staying hydrated
is so important and I am NOT the best
water drinker but every time I work out
and make sure I finish this whole thing
like by the time I come upstairs because
it's so important to stay hydrated
especially after you sweat just in
general but especially if you're working
out so yeah and I love YouTube water
bottle that I got from YouTube misspoke
and
sure to finish it now I'm going to
shower and then I'm going to head to
Christmas
I am right now with Julie in her
apartment I just asked we are cooking
breakfast but she just made me some
Costa Rican coffee because kids don't
know by now she is from Costa Rica I
feel like I've said it every single
video that she's in so yeah she's from
Costa Rica so she made me some of this
Christian coffee I'm really excited
because I love coffee and I put some
French Vanilla creamer this is sugar
free I was making comelet's
for breakfast I am having a omelette and
I put onions spinach and ham with a ham
ham in it and then I put salsa all over
it because I really like sauce with my
eggs and then I'm having some bread
which I can't believe it's not butter
it's zero calories and it tastes really
really good
yeah there it is right there and then I
have my coffee and then we're also
making tater tops so
I thought I would update you guys I am
eating a cheese stick as a snack I feel
like I want to include everything that I
eat today to make this video as accurate
as possible so I'm allowed to have a
cheese stick and then I'm waiting for
grace so that we can make dinner
together so yeah that's what I'm having
guys this is a really good snack to make
you slow for like an hour or so which is
just the amount of time that I need so I
was wrong in that she's sick did not
fill me up because I'm actually really
hungry
and so I just cut up half a cucumber
because I already had the other half
last night and I don't know how long can
come birthday good for so min for New
York tomorrow so I want to eat like all
my vegetables before I leave so I kind
of half of a cucumber it's a good snack
zero calories and they're so so good and
watching new girl while I am waiting for
grace so yeah if you guys watch the show
let me know and if you don't tell me
what your favorite shows on Netflix are

I'm not like in love with new girls so
yeah 1 season 1 episode 9 so it just
started it I'm cooking dinner right now
and I just chopped off a bunch of onions
whole wheat pastas in here tomatoes
basil garlic and I put a little bit of
olive oil and it's one of those one pot
pasta so it's going to absorb and like
the tomatoes is going to make the sauce
so yeah I'm excited to eat it and grace
is here ok her dinner oh go get it
today's just been a day full of cooking
I never cook this much guys like dinner

added pesto and olive oil to just like
add some extra flavor to it
but you had that screener this is mine
I'm so excited like this just looks
really really good and I've made
something like this before but yeah so
that's the olive oil no pesto in case
you need any more flavor but I don't we
just about 15 minutes so before my what
I ate in a giant video so yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed that I really had fun
filming it was super easy to film so I
always like that but yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed if you don't like take give
it a thumbs up if you guys want more of
these may be much better edited or even
just like this let me know let's go to
bed so yeah oh and before I went to that
I also
coconut water shelter like a little
bottle of coconut water I always have
that but yeah that is about all I ate I
am NOT a super super healthy person but
I try to make healthy choices at times
but I still don't try to restrict myself
I'm very much one of those people that
is just everything in moderation so like
yes I did have a bit over lunch which is
not super healthy but like my breakfast
and my dinner kind of balanced it and
you know what if you have an unhealthy
day it's not the end of the world it's
not going to kill you and it's not going
to make you unhealthy as long as you
don't always have an unhealthy day so I
think that she's important for people to
remember having one unhealthy day
doesn't mean anything having to one
healthy day doesn't mean anything just
don't make it a lifestyle so yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this video any other ly
fitness health videos let me know in the

and I'll see you guys next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
