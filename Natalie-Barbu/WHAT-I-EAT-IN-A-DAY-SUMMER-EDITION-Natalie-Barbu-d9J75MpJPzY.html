video kind of vlog style even though the
video isn't just because not only my
what I eat in a day videos are being
like very foggy vid you guys are mayor
hello welcome to my channel thank you
guys so much for watching please be sure
to subscribe down below and follow me on
all my social media if you guys want but
before I get started on this video I
just want to say that this is my ye in a
day and it's not like a Oh super healthy
whatever it's very realistic of what I
do so like all snack in between whatever
but like if I go out to eat during the
summers I'm home a lot but I actually go
out to eat a lot more so in the summer I
eat out a lot so this is kind of a more
like realistic like when I'm at a
restaurant this is what I ordered even
though I'm not the healthiest person per
se I do try to make the healthy
decisions at restaurants and don't have
any diet restrictions also and I know
I'm not like a nutritionist I'm not a
nutrition major so this is just what I
think I should like what I feel fine
with eating
I don't like limiting myself I think
everything is good in moderation so yeah
I cannot throw that out there before I
get comments like I don't know like
telling me that what I'm doing isn't
healthy or whatever because personally I
am NOT a nutritionist or anything so
this is just kind of showing you guys
it's not really like a diet plan that
you guys should follow by any means but
anyways unless just got started in the
p.m.
to start my morning off I really love
avocado toast and I always use this
organic bread good seed that's what it's
called I just get it at a local grocery
store I just put it in the toaster to
make sure it's nice and crispy as so
many good things for you has a lot of
protein a lot of fiber just a really
good bread but it does run out quickly
then I cut open an avocado and I
actually only use half of an avocado
because avocado does have a lot of fat
in it and healthy fat so it's good to
eat but I like doing just half of one
because typically I end up eating either
the second half later today or I'll eat
something else is high in fat good fat
too so just eating half for one meal is
fine for me then I get olive oil salt
pepper and red pepper flakes and that is
what I actually chopped my avocado toast
with it's amazing I love it if you guys
follow me on social media you guys know
I post pictures of my avocado toast a
lot because I absolutely love it and
then I just spread it on the bread and
put all my toppings on it you guys
complain as much or as little as you
guys want you guys can add an egg to it
I normally do that too but I actually
had an egg way earlier before I go in
this video because I have an 8 a.m.
morning class so I just had scrambled
two scrambled eggs so that's something I
didn't film but just letting you guys
know and then I had my avocado test when
I came back because I absolutely love
avocados
in
sorry I picked me up later the day I go
to a coffee shop and I always have a
coffee throughout today this is from
am√©lie's if you guys are from Charlotte
you know where this is I was just doing
some homework and drinking a coffee and
I think it is a girl right
picked me up and then for lunch I
actually went to a barbecue place with
my boyfriend for his lunch break because
he works
uptown because he's a little businessman
and I had deviled eggs some garlic aioli
french fries and pulled chicken
so that's rotisserie chicken and as I
was saying earlier this is not like oh
my gosh what a healthy meal but
everything for me is about portions this
is a really good express lunch
everything within decent portions and I
do not like to limit myself I will grow
who loves fries so then for dinner I
actually went to Panera to get some
drive-thru Panera and again like I said
I end up having an avocado later in the
day so it worked out at the Chipotle
chicken avocado panini and also the
summer corn chowder soup that is by far
my favorite soup from Panera that one
and the autumn squash so I love when
it's in season and then I had some
potato chips and an iced green tea and
that was my dinner it was delicious ice
cream tea there is so good and I'm just
in love with the soup and the chipotle
chicken panini is also amazing highly
recommend let me know your opinion or
order down below and always listen to
try new things and this all I had for my
breakfast lunch and dinner I did have
maybe a couple snacks throughout the day
but that's mainly it and I hope that you
guys enjoyed this video please be sure
to subscribe and I'll see you guys next
time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
