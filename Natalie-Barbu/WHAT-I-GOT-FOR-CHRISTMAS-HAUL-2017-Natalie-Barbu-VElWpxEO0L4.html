today I am filming a very very late what
I got for Christmas video I asked you
guys on Instagram if you guys wanted to
see this video still because I know
Christmas was on I think Monday and it's
currently Friday but if you guys don't
know and if you guys don't keep up with
me on Instagram I have been in Miami for
Christmas so we spend every single
Christmas in Miami just because that's
where I'm from and I have a lot of
family there so we always go back down
there for Christmas but we don't bring
our presents down there so we either
open presents before or after so this
time we open presents after Christmas
and we just opened them last night so I
wanted to get this video up to you at
least the same week of Christmas before
you guys get tired of them unless you're
are any tired of them because I don't
know how some people post their
Christmas videos like at 9:00 a.m. I
wake up and it's what I got for
Christmas videos in my subscription and
I'm like do you open them up like
Christmas Eva or something I hope you
guys aren't tired of them yet and I'd
love to know what you guys got for
Christmas and I know you've heard this
probably thirty million times but this
is not a video trying to brag and I also
know Christmas is not for presents it is
not the main reason about Christmas so
please don't take this the wrong way I
just did this because you guys wanted to
see it and I know I am so so so so so
fortunate to get be able to have these
things for Christmas I know it's not
normal and I know that plenty of people
don't get anything for Christmas so I'm
not trying to make it about presents but
you guys want to see this video so think
of it as like a haul and if you think of
it as anything but without further ado
let's get started so this is stuff that
I got from my family that I'm going to
show and I'm so excited the first thing
that I got is this cute little beanie so
it is from Cece a lot of you guys for
asking on my Instagram post of me in New
York I was wearing like a brown beanie
with a little pom on it and it was this
exact same brand so if you guys are
interested in that beanie or this one I
will try to link them down below because
I don't know where they sell them I know
they sell my boutiques but I'm gonna try
to look up the company's CC because I
don't know Sam's for anything but that's
just what it is and it's so so cute I
absolutely love beanies and these keep
you so warm and socially
your ears you coming over your ears but
I'm walking to class they're gonna be a
cute way to keep me warm because I am
NOT looking forward to the freezing
temperatures the next article of
clothing that I got are these leggings
and they're super super cute they are
from Athleta and they're more like you
wear them out you don't work out with
them so I love them because I have so
many pairs of workout leggings but I
don't really have enough of like actual
leggings to wear so that's why I wear
jeans basically every single day
so my mom got me these which I love they
have leather on the side and they're
gray so it goes with literally
everything and it's actually funny I was
looking at everything I got for
Christmas and I'm like wow all the
clothes are black that's so me like
that's very much my own style I was
actually unpacking and putting away my
clothes and literally everything was
white gray and black and I was like I'm
not complaining the next thing that I
got is this super super cool jacket so
my grandparents actually got this for me
with the help of my sister so thank you
it's this blank NYC jacket and it's not
leather but it is kind of like you like
it I don't know the material it looks
kind of plastic which sounds so bad but
it's like a super cool material so this
is the blank NYC lamanno jacket I think
it's so so cute and I can definitely
dress this up and wear it with so many
different things and it looks so much
different than just like a plain black
leather jacket so I love this I think
it's seriously so cool and I'm so happy
that I got it and the next thing that I
got are these Spanx leggings so my
parents know me very well I love wearing
leggings and these Spanx ones supposedly
are like the best so I got these they
kind of look like fake leather ish but
they're supposed to be keep you warm and
also they just like are very
form-fitting and of course Spanx is the
whole purpose of it is to make you look
a little more sucked in skinnier so
these are gonna be great for the winter
I can definitely see myself wearing
these every single day like not
just because they're black and you can
wear them with anything think I'll be
wearing that is everything and the next
clothing item that I got is this cute
top so it's actually funny
it says Italia on it and I have the
Italian flag and it's so so cute I love
this graphic tee it's from Topshop but I
was a top shop in the mall this week and
I saw and I was like oh my gosh I really
like that I want to get it but I was
just decided not to because trying to
save on like not spending too much money
I'm going to the mall during the
Christmas season it's so hard for me to
not buy for myself I fail almost every
single time like oh my gosh I love that
I want that for me not for anyone else
so I ended up buying things for myself
instead of for other people until like
Christmas Eve then I go shopping for
other people but you guys relate let me
know I was shopping in Topshop and I saw
her and I really really liked it and I
was with my mom and my sister and my
sister secretly bought it while we were
there and gave it to me for Christmas
Thank You Chloe because it really wanted
this shirt and I think it's so cute to
ever it's like jeans and a belt and just
like cool like booties or just sneakers
and sunglasses and like a leather jacket
I think it's a really really cool look
so thank you thank you thank you the
next thing that I got is this wireless
charging so it is for the Apple watch
and the iPhone so I have the iPhone X
and I also have my Apple watch so my
sister gave this to me so I can put them
both in charge them at once so it says
for Apple watch those so I'm gonna need
to make sure that it's not only so that
Apple watch because if it is then I'm
gonna return it cuz I don't need to
charge my Apple watch on this thing when
I have the Apple watch charger but I
think it's for both so if that is then
that'd be super cool cuz then I just
need one outlet for both of them which
would be nice and it can condense it to
when I'm traveling and packing chargers
so yeah I really really like this and I
think it's just so cool we can
wirelessly charge our phones now and the
next thing that I got is this Tom Ford
perfume I love this perfume so much this
is one of my favorite perfumes ever
every time I go into Sephora and
Nordstrom Bloomingdale's where
that sells tomforde I spray like I
drowned myself in it because I think it
smells so so good and it's so expensive
though which is why I never have been
able to afford it for myself but my mom
surprised me for Christmas and I'm so
thankful so it's definitely like the
best like most flirty item I guess that
I got do yourself a favor go to Sephora
go to Nordstrom go to any department
store that sells tomforde and spray it
it is the new Rowley Portofino aqua this
is the Eau de toilettes I definitely
said every single one of those words
wrong but it smells so good it's the
blue bottle and it's a unisex one so if
you want to share it with like your
boyfriend or your brother or your dad
get them this because you will love it
on them and they will love it on you
because it's just the best only thing
it's so clean so fresh I love it
the next thing that I got is this Apple
watch band so the one I currently have
on right now is the only band that I
have it's cute but it's very like it's
black and it's kind of like fancy
looking so it's nice that I got another
one so I got this like brown leather
bands which i think is super super cute
and it's definitely gonna be nice to
wear with like different outfits so I'm
finally gonna be able to switch to the
man I don't have to stick with just
black now which is really nice
the last thing that I got from my family
are these Nikes so I wore them today
actually to work out they're so sick
like I love them so they kind of look I
don't really know how to describe them
but they're really cool they're just
like grey all grey and they have like
the different texture here versus here
and I just think they look so sleek and
cool and I am such a sneaker person I
wear sneakers every single night
sneakers and black booties is basically
all I wear and I wear them every single
day then the next thing that I got is
actually from my boyfriend's parents so
it was so nice of them to get this for
me I was not expecting it at all but my
boyfriend's parents got me is this Nike
shirt so it's this really thin like dry
fit Nike top and I work today
so if it doesn't look new that's why but
it's super super cute and light fit
which is nice
if I'm wearing it over the summer or
when I'm hot or just working out in the
gym like it's really nice because it's
not like a thick cotton shirt I hate
wearing t-shirts to the gym and then
they also got me a pair of Nike leggings
so I wear these every time ago the J I
might like love to wear Nike leggings I
think they're one of my favorites and
they got me these so I was so excited
because like I can never have too many
leggings because I work out like five
times a week and so then they're always
in the wash and so it's great so thank
you to them because this was so nice and
I already wore it already
and then the next thing is from my
boyfriend though it's really funny
everything that he got me well not
everything was some of the things he got
me is really really funny
and so I need to give a back story on
one of them so I was looking online to
do a holiday gift guide for you guys but
I ended up not doing it just because it
ended up being like too late and just I
didn't find anything I really liked but
I wasn't into a holiday gift guide for
you so I was looking for girls like
Holiday Gift Guide for girlfriends to
see what people were saying and one of
the things was a scented squishy
croissant and I was so confused and I
put it on my snapchat story and I wish I
still had any but it was just so funny I
was like who like why is this why did
anyone he would make this like why is
this being produced why is it being
manufactured and why is it on a holiday
gift guide I was just so confused and I
put that on my snapchat story then he
literally got me and it's kind of weird
it smells so much like a croissant like
it's so squishy too it's like a weird
material like it's like a mold like it
molds to your hand
what are those material it's not like a
stuffed animal and yeah it's like full
you guys can see it's already everything
but yeah it smells like a croissant
looks like a croissant get you a man
that knows that listens to you that he
saw it on my snapchat and got me one so
and he also got me some other things he
ended up getting me this Yankee Candle
which is vanilla cupcake which vanilla
if you guys don't know is my favorite
scent and it smells so
good oh my gosh it smells so good sweet
sends like cookies and vanilla and cake
and all of those types of scents are my
absolute favorite so I am so pumped that
you got me this giant candle because if
you guys so now I literally like candles
in my room every single day at school
and I run through them very quickly
thank God he said he got me it's like a
practical gift cuz he was like your
screens are always dirty like my laptop
screen my phone's great so he got me
these touch screen wipes so it's very
practical so thank you and then the next
thing that got me is this Viktor and
Rolf a flower bomb perfume which is
actually like my favorite perfume that I
was planning on getting so the Tom Ford
one is like my favorite perfume but I
never planned on getting it because it's
so expensive and this one is also pricey
I never realized that this is gonna be
my next perfu purchase that I got and he
knew that just because I told him once
so I was so shocked that he knew that
this was like gonna be on my wish list
so I'm so happy and this is literally my
favorite like it's like you guys and the
last thing that he got me I do not
actually have with me right now because
it's still in the mail he said but it's
a choker with my name on it which I told
him that I wanted one so I'm so happy
