happy new year you guys I'm a little
late to the New Year's videos I guess
because it's already January sports it's
generate boards and today I decided to
film a video I have never told before
and it's just a down talking video
because I love those and if you don't
know I'm in the mountains right now so
that is this beauty scene like comfy
couch we can't see us a window sites
really pretty and I have a travel diary
coming up so you guys will be able to
see what I'm in right now but I decide
to build a new year's resolutions video
and things I learned in 2015 I say this
every year but wow I can't believe it's
2016 that is crazy to me um time really
flew by colleges porn guy needs to slow
down but yeah that's life i guess so i'm
just going to share with you guys don't
like life lessons and some of my
resolutions because i think resolutions
are sometimes dumb but if you're
actually going to stick to them then
they're not and these are just some
things i just want to stick with in my
life but not just for the new year so
I've been kind of trying to work on
these just all year round but in this
new year of might as well make a new
year's resolutions video so I'm going to
start with what I learned in 2015 the
first thing that I learned in 2015 is
that being in a relationship is not
worth it if it is not a good
relationship and also a good
relationship does not compromise your
beliefs it does not compromise yourself
it does not compromise your morals
anything like that so please girls don't
just invoice don't just be in a
relationship because you want to be in a
relationship because everyone's in a
relationship is because you just want a
boyfriend or because you're comfortable
with that person because you've been
with them for five years and you think
well I've been with them that long even
though I know it's not the best but I
mean I've been
and then long I can't imagine my life
without them no no I recently kind of
not recently um like six months ago I
broke up with my boyfriend and I have no
hard feelings towards him at all um
solution the best and yeah so that's it
but if it's not so right one and don't
be in it so that's just my I know my
take on a what I learned 2015 is
definitely a learning thing it wasn't a
bad breakup or anything like that it was
just drifting apart and I'm happy for
that I would not miss it okay with a bad
break up with bad breakups are worse but
even if it is it's not a good one then
don't be in it so if you guys don't more
like relationships Q&amp;amp;A stuff leave in
the comments below and I will answer
them because I kind of like giving
advice on this stuff but yeah um I never
talk about my relationship to see you
guys so it's kind of we're talking about
on camera number two is that school is
very important but your GPA does not
define you and I learned this because
last year I finished my first year of
college in the summer or in the spring
whatever in like May of 2015 and Reggie
came was not that high wasn't glow but
it wasn't that high and I'm used to
getting all A's in high school and then
I came to college and I did not get all
A's um so it's just tough and I remember
being so doubted about myself and crying
and so upset about my GPA and my parents
were like hey like it doesn't matter
obviously try to do well try to do your
best but it does not matter it's not the
end of the world we adverse two days of
you and like it's us no matter so yeah
basically your GPA does not
I learned expensive receive the third
thing that I learned is that your mom is
always right and this is funny because
you guys I mean obviously this is not
apply to everyone but to me that is what
makes island and I know it's just kind
of freaky how bombs always know
everything like my mom knows my mom and
asked me a question like how did you
know that Thanks I've no it's just no
it's like really bizarre or she'll tell
me things look I think this is going to
happen if you don't do this let's just
have like advice especially in like with
my relationships she's to me a lot and
like everything that she said has come
true and it's just very weird so mom I
don't watch my videos it's just weird I
hope that I have that like instinct when
I'm a mom but yeah I don't know calm
down below if your mom does that too
because my mom is always right the
fourth thing that I learned is who cares
what people think about you you need to
do your own thing because I associated
someone YouTube thing a lot of people
didn't really understand that and some
people a lot still don't understand it
but I just learned that who cares like
what other people think of me I love
doing YouTube videos and I'm going to do
that I'm going to post about that
because it's something that I love and
also smells love so people get annoyed
with me before like why do you do that
that's show we're like well they'll make
fun of me about it but I don't really
care so yeah that was definitely a
learning experience because in 2014 I
definitely cared and I just not open
about my youtube and yeah when Tina it's
just gonna look more freeing and I've
been able to talk about it and yeah I
don't know I realize my friend actually
do support me so I'm though I'm so
embarrassed
in the past but yeah I just learned this
you got to do what you want to do people
really matter most important in it and
it honestly makes us I hear so much
better if you could talk about it and
then number five I not has to do with
what I learned is number four but it was
just it's okay if you like doing
something that no one else likes doing
again entertains to my YouTube also but
just do what you want to do also the
fourth the fourth one was kind of like
don't care what other people think but
this one is just who cares if what you
if you think that you're not being
normal like normal is so overrated do
what you want to do even if other people
don't want you to do it or not even a
lot of people don't want you to do it
but if you're like wow I'm the only
person in this big huge crowd filming a
video in public like maybe I should sit
down like everyone else no just who
cares do what you want to do even if no
one else is doing it no one is going to
judge you it's specially strangers if
they might look at you funny like oh
what's that person doing and then
they'll go on about their day like don't
worry you're not nothing's gonna happen
so that's just kind of what I've learned
so that I pass things I've learned in
2015 and then I have five new year's
resolutions the first New Year's
resolution is focused on my youtube
channel and that is like such a big risk
of sheer mind because in 2015 i focused
on it a lot and now i was also a
resolution of mine and i think i did
pretty well I gained I think I had like
a subscriber count like in the beginning
of the year to like periodically
whatever I thought like check again it
up throughout the year and I think I
started to doubt she's more team with
like 11 or 12 thousand subscribers and
now
almost thirty one thousand so thank you
to all you guys mean so much to me and
I'm excited that we can get 250 thousand
knives my goal 50,000 it's not about the
numbers but that would be cool also part
of that goal is to focus on videos that
I love I feel like I kind of hit us punk
of not knowing what I want to do with my
DQ channel and the direction of the
ticketing and I love doing makeup and
hair videos and stuff like that but I'm
not into this cookie cutter you tube
image where it's like super cool music
in the front and or in the beginning and
then like a artsy like saturation on
super high video in the middle and then
I don't know I just not me and so I
don't want to do those videos I do like
music in the beginning and stuff like
that but I don't know I think you guys
not i'm saying i love watching those
videos but those are not the videos i
love to own your editing so i don't
think i'm gonna gear towards only those
videos and I wrecked in sitting down
talking videos because I have a lot to
say I'm gonna sing in front of cameras
like care if you did for me so if you
guys run we're talking videos and just
more videos of doing what I want to do
then you are in the right place but yeah
I'm excited to see what you know 768 it
takes us number two resolution my second
resolution is to focus on my website
with Katie me my friend Cady have a
website called the converted I've shared
it so many times on this channel but I'm
so so like I just love it so much and I
want all of you guys to check it out and
i also want to focus on my relationship
with god which that comes hand in hand
with that kind of because become a nerd
it is a christian ministry website for
girls that feel like alone and its cure
and stuff like that and we kind of have
a community together and we're walking
through but to you because me Katy
orange college too and we have a lot of
problems and a lot of struggles too so
also i would have focus on mine better
I'm better in my relationship with god
because that's always a resolution
no matter what time of year it is and
yeah I did each year I've grown grow in
some years I stumble and some years I
crow but I'm hoping this is a grown here
because I hope I learned my lesson Lim
2015 but I know that can be more lessons
to learn but I just hope it number three
is going to be a super cliche anyone but
it is to find a workout pattern that I
want so I always gonna start be here
working out and then it kind of dyes and
it kind of gets back up and then dies
again it's like up and down up and down
but i'm actually going to try to focus
on one I can stick to I'm not going to
make any on reasonable ones like work
out every day of the year no I know I'm
not gonna do that but I hope that I can
do something like work out regularly at
least get my abs back hopefully that
would be nice number four on my
resolutions was to get 50k this year but
I already talked to you guys about that
so yeah that's just our money to get 50k
subscribers I think I'll be super fun
and super cool I think you guys can do
it and number five is to meet multiple
on YouTube and that this isn't from the
labs are some of the more friendships
through you too because I met with my
best friend step on YouTube hey Steph if
you're watching um but yeah me and her
have such a great friendship and she
came to visit me and with North together
and are below to visit her and it's just
like I've never should we both chose to
for love each other and we're just like
best friends and it's just so nice
talking about everything with her she
knows my whole life I know her whole
life no big deal but yeah so I just want
to be more people on YouTube obviously I
don't meet I don't think anyone i'm
gonna me is everything my best friend i
just got pretty lucky with meeting
Stefan us like bonding really well but I
think just mean more people on YouTube
would be good like I've met Hannah
Ashton and sealer cross and I just like
having that community
because I guess what we do and yeah it's
just so much fun whenever we hang out so
that's my other resolution make friends
basically and then my friend grace when
i'm here with in the mountains she's
actually sitting like right there um
she's a blogger and we kind of met
through the internet too so yeah it's
just great friendships me through the
internet now so kind of weird because
like five years ago people really oh
yeah I met my friend on the internet
like that's so creepy like old men just
as 12 year old girls no this time it's
really safe obviously not here little if
you were little don't meet people on the
internet site looks like if you have a
presence on the instrument it's hard not
many people on the internet so yeah that
is it for my video today and I guys like
