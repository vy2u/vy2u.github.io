this intro is a lot of announcements but
I do have a vlog channel and I am
attempting to daily blog this week was
not a good one because I actually had a
very very sore throat I kind of had the
flu I'm still getting over it I don't
know if it was the flu or if it was just
with really bad cold so I'm still
getting over it so my voice sounds
really nasally and stuff it's because I
am extremely congested right now so yeah
bear with me I'm not waste me I'm just
going to be showing you guys what I'm
going to be wearing I'm not going to
show you guys exactly the outfits I'll
be wearing because I want you guys to
follow me on Instagram who see
everything I will be wearing and how I'm
styling it so I'm going to show you each
individual piece but not really the
whole look together you guys want to see
that foam in eisah gram I'm literally
going to be posting so many times a day
so I don't know if you want to follow me
because I'm going to be posting a lot
but if you do want to see that then
definitely do that so on the reset to
show you guys these clothes I am really
excited that they're so cute and I just
love shopping so whenever I go shopping
I just can't wait to share it with you
guys on that residue let's consider it
in the video the first thing that I am
going to be showing the guys is just a
plain t-shirt so we're starting off a
little boring it is a plain t-shirt that
I got at the free mountain three people
there was different people sample sale
but it was also a bunch of other
companies and this one is super drive
the company and they were having a
sample sale at the last time I went to
New York so it is just a big men's
t-shirt love it I will
definitely be wearing that on the plane
back I've already decided what I'm
wearing there but I'm going back it's
just a really comfy large white t-shirt
with the Superdry logo in the corner
also not showing you Aziz in any
specific order so I'm not going to be
wearing that shirt with these jeans but
I'm just pulling things out from
underneath me and you guys can follow me
to see how I style them so these jeans
obsessed with I bought these at
Anthropologie and I showed you guys them
on snapchat and a ton of you guys
screenshot in it I'm a ton of you guys
asked me where they were at friends so
they are from Anthropologie and I was so
excited to get that if these were the
only ones less and they were on sale
they are these hugely bell-bottom jeans
that are frayed at the bottom and they
are citizens of humanity but I got them
on sale and anthropology and
anthropology is having like an
additional sale off of their sale this
one's the only one left and it was in my
size it was meant to be a faster pcs I
don't really see many people wearing
them but I love them I love the lot of
jeans they're also a little like MIDI
jeans like they don't go down to the
floor and I kind of go look right above
the ankle and they have this really cool
look fray a design and texture at the
bottom I'm obsessed
like oh my gosh I've never been happier
to buy pair of jeans in my life I love
them
a classic staple item for any summer
travel thing so if I do any more of
these videos like these shorts will
always be in it I have to have a pair of
black denim high-waisted shorts I'd have
to use it from American Eagle I love
American Eagle shorts I only wear
American Eagle shorts because but
they're so so cute so there's a classic
pair of black high waisted their
festival jeans or festival shorties I
think they're called and yeah that's
just a staple like no matter where I'm
going I'm going to take those in my
suitcase the next is this rapper and I
am so excited up to wear this on the
plane because it's literally like a PJ
it feels exactly like a PJ it reminds me
of like brandy melville material things
and it is just a romper plain grey and
white stripes the straps are adjustable
and it's so so cozy so I can't wait to
wear that honestly might even use as a
PJ all since I know I've been seeing
on Twitter about people like making
jokes about raw fair thing for guys and
I like feel like I'm really old because
they don't understand the joke at all so
if you guys understand like what that's
making fun of is it like a meme and then
I don't know I feel like I'm like your
mom being like hey kids what's the
inside scoop lately but like I really
don't know
same with bended spinning fidgets what's
it called those little things that spin
what is that I don't understand why
they're all over everywhere like I just
don't get it I'm like I just saw them
one time and everyone was like making
fun of them and I just don't understand
fidget so nervous about what they're
called like what contente like fill me
in because I'm obviously old and so out
of the loop that like I have no idea
what they are so yeah comment down below
what they are because I have no idea the
next thing is honestly my favorite thing
that I'm wearing am so so excited
besides the short or decisive jeans this
will might be my next favorite it is
this two-piece set from American Eagle
so is the shorts they're so cute oh my
gosh they're red and they are have a
look little floral print on them but
they're not like too heavy or obnoxious
and they're so comfortable and then the
shirt is what like really drew me to it
it's a crop top but it like ties and
it's a v-neck so it's like crops and
like very dainty inter idea of like a
70s style shirt so it's not just like a
crop top it's like a deep V and it ties
as like the waist and at the bottom of
it and it's just so so cute I literally
like when I thought I had to buy it I
tried it on I was so happy to pick me
because it was caught my eyes so quick
and like I love American girl I think
they have such cute things and I used to
work there so I definitely have some
sort of love for them because I
literally like only wore American Eagle
in high school just because I worked in
there but yeah I'm I love it it made me
wish I was working there hence I can get
the employee discount the next thing
that is from Target and let me tell you
I am so impressed the target quality
target style everything like Target is
the place to shop now for bathing suits
pants dresses whatever like Target and
such keep things I got these pants from
Target and they are from Joe a.g know I
can't speak JOA Jolla Andros it's
pronounced drill out or Jo exams let's
dot in between each letter but they are
these
work pants they look like but they're a
lot more like loops that kind of loose
throughout but they are like trouser
material and again kind of like the
jeans they go above your ankle they kind
of just hit the middle of your cat so
kind of like a MIDI / pair and they're
really loose and flowy and they are
literally like the cutest things I've
ever seen it also came with a top but
they did not have my size at the target
I was shopping at so I just decided it
to just this pants and not the top
because top of show cute I really wish I
had gotten it but I just like yesterday
and I didn't have time to wait for it to
come in just going to New York tomorrow
so but time you guys are watching this I
will be on a plane or in New York let me
know if any of you guys live in the city
because that is where I will be going I
literally go there all the time though
so I'll see you again sometime soon fun
facts a lot of people actually think I'm
from New York I've had a lot of
companies reach out to me me like hey
we're having this event it's been City
like or hey like we're looking for New
York city-based influencers like would
you be interested
like I don't live there like I literally
just go there for vacation like I go
there so often because tickets are
ridiculously cheap from where I live and
it's so like I don't know I think I go
to New York on a very low budget like
it's a great like if I need to get away
like that is my place and it's just my
favorite city in the world like I love
New York
I want to live there someday like I love
that city so much the next thing is this
talk from Free People
it's so cute it's kind of like a crop
top with a flowy like two layers I guess
if you have Intel and the back is really
pretty because it's kind of like an open
back but not really it just kind of
connects with those little strings in
the middle but so so cute and it's
literally perfect
summer outfit I am one of those people
that always wear some neutral colors I
love wearing white box and like beige
colors but in the summer I really do
like trying to branch out and when I see
something like that that's so unique I
really really like to wear it and kind
of have that pop of color and have that
little like BAM wow the next thing is an
accessory and you know I will be
traveling on the plane with this hat I
think it is so cute it is CLP for
Charlotte
my hair is like in my face but I love
traveling with baseball caps to airports
and everything like that so I don't know
I want to bring that in like represent
where I'm from you know because this
isn't such a big haul I like it because
I can like chat with you guys in between
I don't feel rushed not making like a
30-minute long video you know so
whatever the airport people literally
think I'm like 12 years old so I'm 21
years old but every single time I go to
the airport they're like oh like you're
going to take your shoes off honey
that's fraud 13 and over I'm like I'm
literally 20 like this happened like
last year and stuff other times I had
sat in the exit row and the lady was
like oh we need like Anthony 15 I'm like
yeah I know
like I'm like I think that happened when
I was like 19 or something like that
another time someone asked me they act
like oh do you need an ID or something
like how old are you because I think you
need an ID once you're 18 and the guy
behind the guy I was like oh no like I'm
funny and the guy in front of me was
like what he said I thought you were
like 13 like I literally the airport is
where I look my youngest I don't know
why I don't know how but imagine where I
left my youngest regardless if I'm
wearing makeup or not like I will always
look like wait for them how I am Kanaka
below what age you guys think I look
like I mean I know that you guys know
that I'm 21 but like doing look 21

turn 21 I went to the liquor store and I
had like no makeup on and I was learning
