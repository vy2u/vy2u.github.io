I am filming a very kind of random video
to film I didn't know I was going to
film this until about five minutes ago I
was getting ready for church and I was
like hey I have like 45 minutes left I
might as well film a video so today I'm
filming a what's in my first video and
I'm just start this off by saying that
I've seen pretty much every beauty guru
that I watch has hit me - what's in my
purse video and I have watched them all
I really love watching these videos I
think they're pretty just entertaining
to couldn't see what people carry around
but I don't know if it's just me but I
find them extremely unrealistic like
some people carry like literally
probably like 20 pounds worth of stuff
like you do not need all that stuff in
your purse and honestly I highly doubt a
lot of them carry that on a daily basis
I feel like a lot of people kind of just
pull random things from their house and
they're like okay I'll just include this
in my what's in my purse video because
it's once been in my purse
I'm not dissing any beauty gurus at all
I'm just saying as a general observation
I feel like they are just way too much
of stuff and I don't know how they carry
all of that so hopefully this is a more
one thing you guys can relate to because
I could never really relate to those
videos I guess let me know this is also
too much because my mom always says say
that my purse is extremely heavy but
yeah I'll let you guys decide that for
yourself so without further ado let's
just get started into this video so the
person I have is this Burberry bag I'm
not really sure what model it is I know
it came out I believe kind of like a
before school and it's last year so kind
of in the spring I think it came out
because I got it when it first came out
um I loved it it's definitely my
favorite purse I've ever had it was
stuff
I splurged to get I think it was about
three to four hundred dollars so pretty
cheap for a Burberry purse but just
expensive and just overall pretty
expensive okay Wow so I took two suck at
making this video because the first
thing I wanted to show you guys was my
wallet and it actually wasn't even in my
purse it was in my car so anyways the
first thing I normally have in my purse
is my wallet and I have a Marc Jacobs
bully I'm not sure really what name it's
called I know this is a very common Marc
Jacobs wallet though I got a at
Nordstrom I really really like the color
I just really like the kind of metallic
blue that I had and I like these wallets
better than the ones that fold I have a
lot of stuff in here this is mainly what
makes my purse extremely heavy so yeah I
just have like my cards like gift cards
credit cards debit cards and all my
coins are falling out yep clearly I just
apologize for this fail about what's in
my first video and then I have a I have
money in here and I just have my room
key and my place that I live ID in
college and so
yeah I have like all that stuff in there
I'm just going to get this one out of
the way just because it's kind of taking
up a lot of space in my bag I only have
this on Sunday mornings FYI and it is a
Sunday morning so I might as well show
it to you guys I had my final in my bag
because when I go to church I just put
it in my bag so I put that in my bag
this morning
but no I do not have this on my bag on
like Saturday or Friday just on Sunday
morning I also have my sunglass case so
this is these are my ray-bans I really
love these sunglasses I've had them for
years I don't even know how long I've
had them honestly I want to say like
freshman year like yeah I really really
like these sunglasses and I wear them
all the time when I'm driving if it's
sunny of course but yeah I really like
them next thing I have in my bag is some
Advil I actually got this when I was at
the airport and I still have one left
but I am going to try to restock on
Advil when I write about this just
because I get headaches a lot and I do
not have real just seems equally so just
in case of an emergency I really like to
have some ibuprofen in my bag the next
thing I have in my bag are my two gos
products I have my EOS chapstick in it
which I love I love love love these
chopsticks I think they're so cute and
they really moisturize your lips as you
can tell this is kind of a new one but I
have ran out of my other one before this
one's my favorite one I think it smells
really good and it tastes really good
too and then my second EOS product is
their hand lotion my hands get super
super dry so I really like having hand
lotion this is definitely not the
strongest hand lotion it could be better
but just if your hands are kind of a
little dry you can use this but other
times I think I even thought I wanted my
bag looks like a lot better next thing I
have my bag is kind of just a random
Revlon lip color which is actually
supposed to go in my makeup bag but it's
just kind of hanging loose in there so
yeah it's like a really really bright
bag I never wear this color anyway so I
all right I don't even know why it's in
my bag honestly I really don't check the
contents of my bag like this is the
first time I'm seeing a lot of these
things the next thing I have in my bag
are my keys I just have one of these
little keys and then I have these key
chains on it I like to keep it kind of
simple and my car is actually a push to
start so it senses when your keys are
like near the car so you don't even have
to take your keys out to unlock the door
of the car which is awesome for me
because I literally keep those of their
all time look I those would never come
out I just take my bag with me and then
little sense that it's in my bag and
then it assigns to start the car like
it's really cool the next thing that I
have is gum I have like one piece left
but I need gum like I hate having that
taste in my mouth whenever I read I die
without my get really really sad and
anxious so I and the pack just broke Wow
I am extremely dysfunctional today guys
I'm really sorry but yeah in other words
I just really need gum with me exercise
the next thing I have in my bag is
another Neutrogena chubby stick lipstick
thing this is my favorite I love it it
should be my makeup bag but also just
kind of flying free in my bag it isn't
me color brush the box hi and I actually
used that in my Victoria Secret make it
tutorial next thing I have is my
Starbucks gift card that's supposed to
be on my keychain
but this top thing ripped so it like
falls off so that's why it's just
getting my bag I also have multiple
Starbucks gift cards this is not the
only one I used but I thought it was
really cute during the Christmas season
I'll probably get another keychain one
the next thing I'm my bag is a real hand
lotion that sorry do s but just isn't
we this one's a lot better it really up
some your hands are like cracking dry
like really uncomfortable with painful
dry this one is definitely a much better
one and I got it for Christmas the next
day I have my bag is my makeup bag and I
honestly could use could go without this
but it is nice just in that one in a
million chance that you really need to
put makeup on when you're on the go yeah
I'm like Fred actually made this for me
it's so cute for graduation she put
pictures of us all on the bag and made a
little makeup bag I thought that was so
cute just kind of memories of high
school to take with me forever um
anyways it this bag I have my pink
perfume this smells really good I don't
use it that much but you know I do think
that you shot perfume in your bag the
next thing I have in my makeup bag is
these cheetor one perfume again I
probably only need one but I have to
just pretty small compact then I also
have a Smashbox camera ready BB cream
this is just in case I ever are gonna
run out of the house that makeup on in
really get touched up really fast so I
just have a BB cream because I think
foundation it would be a little too
messy to work with then I have my lip
plumper again I don't ever use this then
I have my Tarte Amazonian clay
illuminating serum I haven't used this
either but it's small so I kind of just
put it in there then I have my baby lips
which I do actually use I really I went
through a stage where I was obsessed
with baby lips and yeah so I still have
this one in there it's tinted and it
actually does give it a really nice
color then I have my Revlon color what
are these called again I totally forgot
what they're called but uh this one I
actually had all my lips right now so I
do actually wear this one so yeah
basically just kind of open I have my
stuff
I have my NARS lip and so this one is
awesome I seriously love it I use it so
much
I just need to sharpen it like gone and
then I had my NYX blush stick
so again if I'm on the go and kind of
need a little color I don't use a lot of
these things I will be honest with you
but you know what in case of emergency I
think
one day they'll come in handy maybe it
maybe just one get it they'll comedy
everywhere and then the next thing my
purse comes with this thing is my behind
like it's so it just got the attach so
you can connect this inside my purse
it's kind of like a divider so it comes
with this on the side pockets here I
have a tampon you know cuz they're girls
in case of any emergencies you really
need that and then I have some a gas
card and I have wisps and I have wet
wipes for your hands when you get
stickier I'm not kidding I use these all
the time um but yeah so that's basically
all I have in my bag I hope you guys
really Oh last thing sometimes I keep my
phone in my bag if it's not in my hand
it will be in my bag I have the iPhone 6
oh wow that's a 5 iPhone 6 it's in the
color white and this is the cutest case
I've never seen in the world it's like a
see-through case but I had like gold
shells kind of on it but it's
transparent and you can probably see my
tripod our mini or milk chocolate
pretzels yeah it's like when I come home
from college and I don't have my tripod
cos I forget to bring it every time
that's kind of what I have to do I kind
of have to be a little innovative but
yeah that is all I have in my bag let me

not relatable what's in my bag video and
