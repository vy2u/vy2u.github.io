I am filming in my college dorm room
which I finally have my tripod yay so I
can finally make more videos for you
guys here anyways I am filming a what's
on my iPhone video and at first I always
thought these videos were kind of weird
and I was like I don't know why people
want to see what's on someone's iPhone
that's kind of personal it's just weird
but then I started watching them and I
got actually a ton of cool apps from
them and I took I don't know I kind of
am a nosy person so creeping into that
little side of you guys cool um I don't
know maybe that's weird maybe that's
just me I but yeah so I'm filming that
for you guys today I figured it was a
very easy video to film and it's a snow
day outside today so I may look like
undressed cute from the top but yeah
actually we're um
but yeah so we are snowed and basically
North Carolina does not get a lot of
snow so we don't really know what to do
when we get it but anyways before I
start this video I also wanted to let
you guys know I want to do Q&amp;amp;A soon and
I've said this in multiple videos but I
really really want to do one so please
comment on my last Instagram post and
comment all your questions because I
think they would be so much fun to
answer I've already gotten a couple but
I really just want more videos and I
think I'm gonna film it about next week
before spring break so yeah just so you
know that's what I'm doing it so without
further adieu let's just jump into this
oh and obviously you have to know my
Instagram to fall or to ask questions so
it's at Natalie underscore Barbie but
yeah let's just get started and do this
what's on my iPhone and you guys can
kind of get your nose in my business
somewhere so here is my iPhone and yep
just plain old iPhone I have this really
cool case um it's from Nordstrom by
really I'm digging these cool clear
cases so yeah I have the iPhone 6 and I
have a silver one so it's just gonna
unlock it and yeah here's what it looks
like so I really like the iPhone 6
because it has a huge screen and I don't
have the Plus because that's just way
too big for me so I only have one page
so I really really like that cuz
everything's just right there I don't
need to slide anywhere I'm so I have my
music at the top photos camera settings
plane things newsstand iTunes Appstore

know if you guys do so I don't really
know what those notifications are um
iBooks let's see what books I have I

know that I used to really love reading
my books on my iPhone and I don't know
why I just like stopped reading them on
there yeah I don't really have any I
guess I used to you before I have this
iPhone then I have my utilities folder
and my utilities folder it has basically
everything this is where if I don't know
where something goes I put it in here so
has my alarm clock calendar I really
like using Waze and I recommend everyone
using it so we can all know when their
cops around because you report when you
see a cop lurking and that'd be nice if
everyone had it so we can always report
those I don't really know why it warns
you about vehicles on the side of the
road because I don't really care about
that then I have Google Maps just cuz I
really do like using Google Maps too but
I'm trying to use Waze a lot more
especially long distances then I have
three weather apps so I have the normal
aqua weather app I have my Yahoo app

really pretty graphics and then I have

building is which really helped me when
I was trying to find my classes then I
have trip o matic which is super cool I
had a trip to Washington DC and I
totally planned it on here and what we
were gonna do is really really cool
oh and then I also have my Bible app
which it's just the Holy Bible a regular
by the web men I have games and I like
playing games sometimes I really like
like icon pop quiz I haven't played that
in a while but it's really fun heads up
is seriously awesome in a group like I
seriously recommend everyone to buy that
game

icon pop song which is the same thing
but with songs so that was really fun
20:48 I stopped playing but I still have
it this is the weirdest / coolest thing
ever it's called
a kanay der literally any character
you're thinking of no matter how small
they are they guess it like oh my gosh
any I tried YouTube people I tried like
Dave the Barbarian I tried sheep the
Sheep on that Disney Channel short film

but I guessed it and II got it right so
it's really really creepy then I have a
trivia crack which I never play anymore

a lot of fun my entertainment / internet
app I have Fandango to buy movie tickets
BuzzFeed which is always good when
you're bored I have TSM which is total
sorority move which is not news at all
but it's just um it's entertaining when
I'm bored I have fox news and then on
this page I have T FM and I put it on
the back because I didn't want people
seeing I had that because it's like
total frat moves so it's for boys but
well I have it then on my social app I
have my tumblr which you guys can follow
me on tumblr
I doubt your doubts so there I am that's
cute picture and then I have my
Pinterest you guys can follow me on that
too Facebook vine I love behind like I'm
obsessed with mine I think that's so
funny and I always try to kind of mimic
them um I have my followers app I don't
know why I have this it tells you who
one follows you but I literally never
check it um then I have yak yak which is
if you don't know it's kind of like an
anonymous Twitter for colleges or
destroy your area then I have group me
which is good for my Zeta pledge class I
have we all communicate through that Jin
is also for sorority stuff so it says
ADA facebook Messenger which they made
me download I have LinkedIn for business
stuff which I want to start using more
often and then I have time hop which I
just recently got so let's see what I
have I have connect KK okay so let's see
if there's anything funny on here I'm
like a long time ago a long day excited
for tomorrow and Sunday oh hi remember I
just found a bulldog on my porch yeah
okay
so sometimes it's funny then on my music
I have hit Pandora Spotify which I
always use Spotify that no I don't even
remember the last time I used my iTunes
and SoundCloud my health and fitness one
I have a ton of nutrition menus which I
gotta delete those because I never use
them anymore I just got them from the
internet so PF Changs California Pizza
Kitchen with Donald's chick-fil-a and
smoothie King which are basically places
I'd go a lot so I stored them on here
then I have Matt my run I have my
fitness pal which is really cool it
tells you how many calories you eat a
day you obviously have to input it but
it really helps you keep track on
calories and yeah I like that then I
have my pill which kind of lets me know
when to take it I have my health app
which is just from the iPhone let's see
my distance today
be nice yesterday today 0.14 and it's
already four o'clock
wow that's really sad and then I am my
Blogilates app which I am obsessed with
Blogilates this is all I work out too so
she's awesome and there it's really
inspiring and then I have order up which
is it's a delivery for its I guess it
like depends on where you live but it
delivers restaurant food to you so
that's pretty cool photography app here
I have pic frame which is just collages
so I barely ever use this anymore
then I have Instagram obviously so you
can follow me on Instagram if you want
and this is the picture I'm talking
about to comment on so I already have
some but make sure you guys comment on
it that'd be awesome
and then I have face juggler which is so
funny like juggles around your faces
I have snapchat so yeah if you don't
really want to give it out it's a
personal snapchat but here you guys want
to look at yourself hey so my phone ring
or my camera ran out of memory but
anyways I have afterlight which I used
to edit my pictures on here but I don't
do that anymore but it has a lot of cool
filters and stuff like that you guys
want a total separate video on how I
edit my Instagram pictures will let me
know but I don't want to do that in this
video um then I had my app vsco cam
which this is like my favorite app ever
I edit all my pictures on here I just
recently started using it though so it's
kind of new but that's a really like
great app I'm Avery which I don't really
know what I do with it but whatever um
snap up that lets you like upload
pictures to snapchat instead of like
taking them on snapchat so if you have
something on your phone that you kind of
want to share you can do that but I
think I ran out of the free amount of
times I could use it
facetune is really cool I had to buy it
but it's actually a pretty cool app you
can like try a demo photo sure anyways
you can basically like smooth stuff out
like Kay smooth everything
then you can okay oh you can reshape
this this is so funny I saw this one
girl on Instagram that literally
reshapes her butt to make it look bigger
and it's I do that I would recommend not
doing it because it's a very very
obvious but literally it's like this is
her and then like okay this is like her
butt going out like that but you could
totally tell because the wall behind her
is also curved I'm just like girl you
can everyone can tell that is so fake
like why do you even want to make your
butt look like that like just love
yourself the way you are you don't need
that um yeah and then for my shopping
apps I have this app called steals and
this gets you like a lot of coupons for
nearby stuff I've gotten a lot of stuff
from them so yeah like you can get like
a free value shake from RVs just like
random stuff like that then I have my
Urban Outfitters app which I just have
this because I got 10% off when I
downloaded it and yeah you scan this
when you purchase something I have my
each street app I have a lot of food
apps I guess I haven't logged on it just
tells you the restaurants nearby
I have venmo which is good because you
get to pay people on here so it like
links to your debit card up to it and
then you pay people on venmo so you if
you don't have cash you can still pay
people back then I have this app called
keep and it's really pretty um basically
it just shows you all these really cool
things that you want to buy and it makes
me my online shopping addiction grow
even more so I definitely recommend it
for everyone and you can buy it like off
of there it's kind of like the middleman
then I have the hunt which if you guys
don't know a lot of youtubers I think
let's talk about it but yeah it's just
if you guys need something like oh where
do you get where do I find this then
people will comment down below like
where you buy it it's pretty cool
there all these have like zero fines on
them but you're all like do this one
like that and then people like help you
out and comment down below where you get
and I think a lot of youtubers are
sponsored about with that app but I
promise you I'm not I just have it
then I have creep on which is good for
deals it's really good for like if you
want to spend $30 at a restaurant but
it's said you can spend like you pay 30
and you get to spend 40 so it saves you
a lot of money if you find a good deal
off of it then I have Poshmark
which I'm gonna start doing when I get
home I'm gonna start selling my clothes
so if you guys want to follow me on here
you guys can buy something like clothes
I don't have anything right now but
basically you just buy people's clothes
so it's a way to make money then I have
my travel app I have lyft uber and Urban
Spoon Urban Spoon I really like because
I'm always eating it or I'm always going
out to eat and I like this thing or it's
not shake ya shake and then it tells you
a restaurant nearby and it's random and
so you if you and your friends can't
decide where to eat we normally use that
then I have my documents so that's all
the Apple things that it came with all
nine six so I have tips podcast Pages
Numbers keynote iTunes University iMovie
GarageBand Google Docs which I
downloaded myself
um OneNote which is awesome for school I
use all my philosophy notes on here um
yeah so here's like my computer
programming class notes I have on here
here was like my study guide so I used
that and it programmed it like links up
with everything else and my philosophy
notes on here so like it links up with
your computer my tablet everything so
it's really cool and then I have Google
Chrome I'd never use Google Chrome on my
iPhone because I just used to fari down
here I have my phone which my mom just
called me so I don't like having that
notification my iMessage is my Safari
and Twitter which I should probably swap
out Twitter for Instagram because I
never use Twitter anymore but yeah if
you guys want to follow me on that you
can i guess but i really don't tweet so
yep that is just all that is on my
iphone and yeah this video is pretty
long to film and I'm like still talking
