i am filming in my college dorm room
which i finally have my tripod yay so i
can finally make more videos from guys
here um anyways I am filming a what's on
my iPhone video and at first I always
thought these videos were kind of weird
and I was like I don't know why people
want to see what's on someone's iPhone
that's kind of personal it's just weird
um but then I started watching them and
I got actually a ton of cool apps from
them and I think I don't know I kind of
am a nosy person so creeping into that
personal side of you guys cool um I
don't know maybe that's weird maybe
that's just me I but yeah so I'm filming
that for you guys today I figured it was
a very easy video to film and it's a
snow day outside today so i may look
like undressed cute from the top but uh
yeah actually we're yoga pants um but
yeah so we are snowed in basically North
Carolina does not get a lot of snow so
we don't really know what to do what we
get it but anyways before I start this
video I also wanted to let you guys know
I want to do a Q&amp;amp;A soon and I've said
this in multiple videos but I really
really want to do one so please comment
on my last Instagram post and comment
all your questions because I think they
would be so much fun to answer I've
already gotten a couple but I really
just want more videos and I think I'm
gonna film it about next week before
spring break so yeah just so you know
that's what I'm doing it so without
further ado let's just jump into this oh
and obviously you have to know my
Instagram to fault verte ask questions
so it's at Natalie underscore Barbu but
yeah let's just get started and do this
what's on my iPhone and you guys can
kind of get your nose in my business
somewhere so here is my iphone and yep

cool case um it's from nordstrom by
really i'm digging these cool clear
cases so yeah I have the iphone 6 and i
have a silver one so just gonna unlock
it and yeah here's what it looks like so
i really like the iphone 6 because it
has a huge screen and I don't have the
plus because that's just way too big for

basically everything this is where if I
don't know where something goes I put it
in here so has my alarm clock calendar I

everyone using it so we can all know
when they're cops around because you
report when you see a cough lurking and

can always report those um I don't
really know why it warns you about
vehicles on the side of the road because

at all but it's just um it's
entertaining when I'm bored I have fox
news and then on this page I have TFM

didn't want people seeing I had that
because it's like total frat move so
it's for boys but well I have it
then on my social app I have my tumblr

uh I doubt your doubts so there I am
that's cute picture and then i have my
pinterest you guys can follow me on that
too Facebook vine I love behind like I'm
obsessed with mine I think it's so funny
and I always try to kind of mimic them
um i have my followers app I don't know
why I have this tells you who one
follows you but I literally never check
it um then I have Yik yak which is if
you don't know it's kind of like an
anonymous Twitter for colleges or
destroy your area then I have group me

just recently got so let's see what i
have i have connect kk okay let's see if
there's anything funny on here from like
a long time ago long day excited for
tomorrow and sunday oh hi remember i
just found a bulldog on my porch yeah
okay so sometimes it's funny then on my
music i have hit Pandora Spotify which i
always use Spotify doubt no I don't even
remember the last time I used to my
itunes and soundcloud my health and
fitness one i have a ton of nutrition
menus which I gotta delete those because
I never use them anymore I just got them
from the internet so PF changs
California Pizza Kitchen mcdonalds check
the line smoothie king which are
basically places i'd go a lot so I
stored them on here then I have Matt my
run i have my fitness pal which is
really cool it tells you how many
calories you eat a day you obviously
have to input it but it really helps you
keep track on calories and yeah I like
that then i have my pill which kind of
lets me know when to take it i have my
health app which is just from the iphone
see my distance today that tells me oh
nice yesterday today point 14 and it's
already four o'clock wow that's really
sad and then I am I Blogilates app which
I am obsessed with Blogilates this is
all I work out too so she's awesome and
there it's really inspiring and then I
have order up which is it a delivery for
its I guess it like depends on where you
live but it delivers restaurant food to
you so it's pretty cool photography app
here I have pic frame which is just um
collages so I barely ever use this
anymore then I have Instagram obviously
so you can follow me on instagram if you
want and this is the picture I'm talking
about comment on so I already have some
but make sure you guys comment on it
that'd be awesome and then I have
facebook juggler which is so funny like
juggles around your faces I have
snapchat so yeah if you don't really
want to give it out so it's a personal
snapchat but here you guys want to look
at yourself hey it's funny so my phone
ring or my camera ran out of memory but
anyways I have after light which I used
to edit my pictures on here but I don't
do that anymore but it has a lot of cool
filters and stuff like that you guys
want a total separate video on how i
edit my Instagram pictures let me know
but I don't want to do that in this
video um then I had my appt vscocam
which this is like my favorite app ever
I edit all my pictures on here I just
recently started using it though so it's
kind of new but that's a really like
great app I've Avery which I don't
really know what I do with it but
whatever um snap up that lets you like
upload pictures to snapchat instead of
like taking them on snapchat so if you
have something on your phone that you
kind of want to share you can do that
but I think I ran out of the free amount
of times I could use it facetune is
really cool i had to buy it but it's
actually a pretty cool app we can like
try a demo photo sure anyways you can
basically like smooth stuff out like k
smooth everything
um then you can okay oh you can reshape
this this is so funny I saw this one
girl on Instagram that literally
reshapes her but to make it look bigger
and it's I if you guys do that i would
recommend not doing it because it's a
very very obvious but literally it's
like this is her and then like okay this
is like her but going out like that but
you could totally tell because the wall
behind her is also curved I'm just like
girl you can everyone can tell that is
so fake like why do you even want to
make your butt look like that like just
love yourself the way you are you don't
need that um yeah and then for my
shopping apps I have this app called
steals and this gets you like a lot of
components for nearby stuff i've gotten
a lot of stuff from them so yeah like
you can get like a free value shake from
rvs just like random stuff like that
then I might urban outfitters app which
um i just have this because i got ten
percent off when i downloaded it and
yeah you scan this when you purchase
something I have my each Street app I
have a lot of food apps I've guess I
haven't logged on it just tells you the
restaurants nearby I have venmo which is
good because you get to pay people on
here so it like links to your debit card
up to it and then you pay people on
venmo so you if you don't have cash you
can still pay people back then I have
this app called Keith and it's really
pretty um basically it just shows you
all these really cool things that you
want to buy and it makes me my online
shopping addiction grow even more so i
definitely recommend it for everyone and
you can buy it like off of there it's
kind of like the middleman then i have
the hunt which if you guys don't know a
lot of youtubers i think to talk about
it but yeah it's just if you guys need
something like oh where'd you get where
do i find this then people will comment
down below like where you buy it it's
pretty cool they're all these have like
0 finds on them but you're all like do
this one like that and then people like
help you out and comment down below
where you getting and i think a lot of
youtubers are sponsored about with that
app but i promise you i'm not i just
have it
then I have creeped on which is good for
deals it's really good for like if you
want to spend thirty dollars at a
restaurant but instead you can spend
like you pay 30 and you get to spend 40
so saves you a lot of money if you find
a good deal off of it then I have
poshmark which I'm gonna start doing
when I get home I'm going to start
selling my clothes so if you guys want
to follow me on here you guys can buy
something like clothes I don't have
anything right now but basically you
just buy people's clothes so it's a way
to make money then I have my travel app
I have lyft uber and Urban Spoon
urbanspoon I really like because I'm
always eating it or I'm always going out
to eat and I like this thing or it's not
shake ya shake and then it tells you a
restaurant nearby and it's random and so
you if you and your friends can't decide
what to eat we normally use that then i
have my document so that's all the Apple
things that it came with on the iphone 6
so i have tips podcast Pages Numbers
keynote iTunes University iMovie
GarageBand Google Docs which I
downloaded myself um one note which is
awesome for school I use all my
philosophy notes on here um yeah so
here's like my computer programming
class notes I have on here here was like
my study guide so I used that and it
programmed it like links up with
everything else I my philosophy notes on
here so like it links up with your
computer my tablet everything so it's
really cool and then i have google
chrome I'd never use google chrome on my
iPhone because I just use Safari down
here I have my phone which my mom just
called me so I don't like having that
notification my imessages my Safari and
Twitter which I should probably swap out
Twitter for Instagram because I never
use twitter anymore but yeah if you guys
want to follow me on that you can I
guess but I really don't tweet so yep
that is just all that is on my iPhone
