my goodness I have missed you guys so
much
I am very sick so if you hear that I
have a stuffy nose or like a weird voice
at any point in this video you guys know
why but I feel like I just have not sat
down and talked to you guys in such a
long time I feel like I haven't been on
YouTube in like a year and I know I just
posted a video last week and I know I
filmed a video last week but like I just
have been in such a different mindset
that I just feel like I haven't been
talking to you guys and connecting with
you guys in so long let me know if you
guys feel the same way if you guys feel
like I've been distant or weird or
anything like that because that is
definitely how I feel I am just so
overwhelmed and I hope you just wanted
to filmed film this life update video
because I mean hi like I haven't talked
to you guys in forever so I'm going to
talk about my school life next I'm going
to talk about jobs career post college
life and then after that I'm going to
talk about my youtube life so most you
guys know I am an industrial engineering
majors in the College of Engineering
here at NC State and I am a senior this
is my last year I'm graduating in May
and I'm so excited you guys I am ready
to graduate like I love college and I
know and like all the like college is
fun and I'm living with my friends and
it's great but like I am so ready to be
done with classes I really really am
ready oh my gosh it isn't so
overwhelming so I am now in my core
industrial engineering classes which are
not as bad as like it's an ecstatic
circuits thermo you know like all of
those like hard classes it's not like
the difficulty level isn't there but I
just have so much work like every single
class has group work and every single
classes projects with groups and like
you constantly have to be meeting with
groups and meeting with people and like
I feel like I'm constantly going from
class to a group meeting to a group
project to home to study for an exam to
a group meeting to a group project to
class to study Burton and say I'm like I
am constantly doing that stuff and I
feel like if you guys are in college and
especially if you're an engineering you
totally understand my
it's just a lot of good work and a lot
of projects and I'm ready to be done
next semester though I am only in nine
credit hours I'm under loading my second
semester senior year so I really am
chillin uh-huh I have a senior design
project and then two classes so I'm in
senior design one class and one online
class so I literally only go to class
twice so it's gonna be really nice and
I'm gonna have so much free time and
yeah it's just gonna be amazing so next
semester I will be like back way more
like active on videos it's just I know
that you guys understand but I just feel
like I have to like say I'm sorry and
have this excuse for you guys I know
them talking so much so I need good
contributions so comment down below all
of your random thoughts as you have this
video so we have a conversation or
respond to you if you guys have anything
you want to vent about vent down below
please also if you go to college tell me
what college you go to in the comments
down below because I love knowing where
all my viewers are problem I have had a
couple people come up to me here and see
state saying that they watched my videos
and if you're watching this and you go
to NCC and you ever see me please come
and say hello because that literally
makes my day I really miss just sitting
down and talking okay oh so I got the
iPhone X it's pretty cool really liked
it I just have a clear case you guys
want me to do what's on my iPhone X
iPhone 10 whatever let me know now
talking about career stuff so like big
girl stuff no as for a job I am excited
to announce that I have a job lined up
for next year which is crazy because
they did not think I was going to get
one this early on into the year so it is
currently November and I graduate in May
they have a job lined up for next year
and literally just got off with the job
this week so I haven't like said
anything yet to it but I have an offer
which is amazing I don't want to tell
you guys details yet
especially because nothing is like
official so I'm not gonna say any
details it is with an engineering like
it is on the engineering track it's like
an engineering business track I would
love to know your guesses on what you
think it is so a lot of engineering
people do this type of thing and a lot
of business majors do the same thing
actually a lot of a lot of majors do
this
things so yeah let me know I know what
it is so I am excited about that and if
you guys have been sticking around on
this channel you guys know that my heart
has always been New York or LA or just a
big city in general I've always been set
on New York really that's like kind of
where my heart has been but this year I
was like kind of thinking LA also but
this job offer is not in any of those
cities is actually still in North
Carolina and that was the only thing I
was struggling with was the fact that it
was in North Carolina like I had my
heart set on New York for the longest
time but here's the good thing about
this is that I have learned this year
that it is not in my control anymore
like I have just got to give it all the
gods like God take the wheel
jesus take the wheel second Carrie
Underwood right now but seriously like
just take control of my life because I
don't even know what where I'm gonna be
in five years I don't know where you
want me to be in five years I don't know
what I'm doing with my life so I'm just
handing it onto you and I'm gonna listen
to what you put in my face that's what
I've been doing and the second I started
doing that is when I got this job offer
and I did feel a piece about it I do
snow sometimes feel like I like New York
but I do feel peace about it and I'm so
happy and thankful to God I was just so
stressed and caught up and trying to
find the perfect city and being in a
nice big city and being in New York and
being like I don't know like I've just
been so caught up in that mindset that I
feel like my mic set up constantly being
like New York New York New York New York
was just like God was trying to tell me
like hey like nice thought but no you
know and so now I have a piece about it
and I really am happy with the way
things are gonna work out hopefully and
um the way things are right now so I
just gotta give it all to him because
the second I said that I mean the sewer
opened up for me so guys are feeling
that way totally understand like the
whole senior year feeling of being like
holy crap I don't know where I'm gonna
be next year because every year until
now you knew what you were gonna do
freshman year of college
oh I'm just gonna be back and see seats
offer year of college learning back ends
see junior year I'm gonna be back at NC
State in a year and then senior year I'm
just like I literally could be anywhere
on the map like anywhere on the freakin
map I could be I have no clue
so that was just kind of hard for me too
it's kind of hard to me now to even
process being like oh my gosh next year
I'm not gonna be here anymore like I'm
going to be graduated and like I'm not
gonna be living with my friends anymore
and I'm not gonna like who knows what's
gonna happen with like friendships and
relationships and all this stuff and
it's really really hard so I had all of
that mixed in with like job searching
and group work and project tests and
exams and all of that has just been so
overwhelming for me
um oh my gosh it just feels good talking
to you guys okay um I literally feel
like I'm about to cry right now I don't
know why I'm not that emotional I don't
know what that is basically my career
journey which is going to now bring me
it to YouTube I know the number one
question I'm going to get which is the
number one question I get mail from
friends and family is am I gonna do
YouTube after college and the answer
that is 100% absolutely yes so don't
ever think for a second I'm gonna quit
doing YouTube because I'm not like I
this is what keeps me sane talking to
you guys
keeps me sane this this connection that
we have I'm not gonna just be like okay
bye nice knowing ya know I absolutely
love making videos and the part about
video making that I like is not really
about the editing it's not about the
whole like film and production it really
is talking to you guys and making a
connection with you guys and getting to
work with company is getting to talk
like respond to your comments and listen
I don't know I just feel like you're you
guys are like my best friends so that is
why I do youtube I don't do it because
of money I don't do it because of the
editing process I really just I mean of
course all of that its parts like I do
enjoy editing videos making them cool
but and I do enjoy obviously getting
paid for this and having this be my job
but it's not like that's why I do it
anyway because I like talking to you
guys
and just having that connection so
anyways time to be cheesy with YouTube I
am stuck I have been in a really weird
place with YouTube I have picked up my
blogging camera I think like 20 times to
vlog and I start vlogs every single day
and I never finished them and I never
edit them because I just don't like them
I don't like the way I feel when I'm
doing it I don't know I'm just in a
weird place with YouTube and I need you
guys to help me so what I need you guys
to do is tell me videos that you want to
see do you want to see vlogs I have a
blog channel that I haven't updated in a
really long time but subscribe to that
if you do want to see when I do come
back to that what do you want like you
wanna see vlogs you want to see more
talking videos and just like hanging out
videos you want to see I don't know
anything just let me know what you guys
want to see on this channel because this
is for you like I said the reason I do
it is literally because of you guys not
trying to be like cheesy but like it's
true I'm gonna see more makeup videos
you want to see more college related
videos like what do you guys want to see
because I have just been stuck and I
feel like YouTube with subscribers and
everything like of course I am NOT doing
it for that but that makes me feel good
when I have more of you guys to talk to
when I have more of you guys watching my
videos obviously I feel like that's just
like anyone who says that they don't
they don't care if they have zero
subscribers or million is lying because
if you have zero subscribers you don't
have anyone to talk to
just so you know like I mean personally
that's my own opinion so of course I
want like more subscribers anyways I
feel like YouTube has kind of been
plateauing for me and said I'm not
grabbing as much as I used to or
sometimes I'll like shoot up and then
other times I'll dip down you know it's
just in a weird place and I've talked to
other creators and they all kind of feel
the same way and I don't know if YouTube
is just going through a funk but I don't
know I'm going through a funk - so maybe
it's because of that but yeah so I just
I want my goal at the end of 2002 the
team was to hit 100,000 subscribers
regardless if I do that I don't know I
really don't care but I want to do a
huge huge huge huge huge giveaway for
you guys once I hit a hundred thousand
because I would just be incredible I
actually did a video or I did a giveaway
when I hit 100 subscribers on this
channel I was so excited that I did it
a giveaway so I really want to think
it'd be really cute to kind of do a net
100 and then at 100,000
but yeah help me get to that by
subscribing telling your friends to
subscribe buttom basically the moral of
the story is I'm so stressed in school
thank you guys are understanding and I
know that you guys feel my pain and I'm
not like the only person the world was
schoolwork like I get that have a job
lined up for after college most likely
I'm not gonna say anything drinks again
whatever but that I'm excited to
announce you guys I'll probably just
announce that you guys like next year
like next semester when it's closer to
weeks I literally don't know any details
right now and then I'm gonna be doing
YouTube forever basically well I'm gonna
be doing easy as long as you guys want
me to be doing YouTube because even if I
have a job I make have to like limit the
times I post make them go from from
singing once a week or twice a week to
once a week but I am going to post like
I'm gonna have a weekend I'm gonna have
free time I'm gonna have a time to sit
down and film videos especially because
then your job you know best part about
post-college I feel like that is it for
this video thank you guys for listening
to my ramblings and if you're still here
you guys are the real MVP so let me know
in the comment down below say Natalie we
made it it was the next wish mark if you
guys are still made it to this part of
the video and I am so big out of Tampa

tests today and they went horribly but

matters
