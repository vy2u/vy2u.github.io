older sister hey and then my younger
sister who actually started a YouTube
channel so if you guys want to see how

different questions like we just made up
our own questions and watched a bunch of
videos for like inspiration but anyway

random questions first question what did
I want to be when I was younger
this isn't fair I wasn't even born

win this when she gets to the more
recent question okay okay you can't see
anything
so she said actress she's a doctor wrong
hydronic Chris I knew yeah you did no no
I'm good
I think at one point I wanted to be
dermatologists in my life and then
another point I wanted to be a surgeon
when I started watching Grey's Anatomy
but that like went out the window like
real quick even I'm an event for fact
what was it called when you think when
yeah I like really want to be an actress
I went to LA for audition was like I
don't remember
aye-aye-aye something oh yeah nice other
things there oh good okay um and what
