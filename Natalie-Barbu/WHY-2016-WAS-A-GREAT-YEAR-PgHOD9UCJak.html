I am coming to you guys with a
Thanksgiving related video I was gonna
be able to make up video for
thanksgiving and then i completely
forgot and I didn't want to upload
another blog because I feel like I've
been only uploading vlogs and I'm gonna
upload one next week about like my
thanksgiving break but I didn't want it
to be like two or three blogs in a row I
just felt like that might be too much so
I decided to do a video that is very
positive and maybe hopefully put two
week I PES I feel like everyone always
says that 2016 was the worst year ever
and how it was so bad and I not gonna
lie I agree it was pretty bad year for
the world's like a lot of bad things
have happened in 2016 and I feel like
people have been saying this is like
march up 2016 so everyone leaves like
kind of like a running joke like all
right what is it over and I totally get
that it has been kind of a weird year
and definitely some that people cannot
wait to get over I just wanted to share
with you guys some positive things and
some good things that happen in the year
2016 and things that we should all be
thankful for so I'm doing 10 great
things that happened in 2016 in the
world and also 10 great things that
happen in 2016 in terms of my own life
and i kinda want to make this like a tag
I guess like you guys don't have to make
a video on it you don't want to but I
totally encourage you to do this video
as a tag but if you guys don't have a
channel or you don't feel like making a
video please comment down below 10 great
things that happen in your life or 10
great things that you just think
happened in 2016 overall if i missed it
also a total disclaimer but i got the
all of these from the internet so yeah
you know that tumblr post that went
around that like great things that
happened in 2016 i got a lot of these
from there so because haven't seen it
then you guys don't know what i'm
talking about which is great but if you
have a don't comment like oh my gosh
this is so copied like I mean yeah I'm
not original when it comes to like great
things that I like I didn't pull any of
these out I don't know I feel like
obviously I used the Internet as my
resource to find out what great things
happen in 2016 but also I want to share
this list with you guys in case you guys
didn't see that tumblr post or whatever
so that's why I'm making this
video so I really don't need any
negative comments especially on a video
that is trying to kind of be like Paul
today I've been happy if you guys leave
negative comments they're just gonna get
slated so let's get swung everything
that happened is that we found the gene
linked to ALS which is one step closer
to curing the disease so thank you ice
bucket challenge if you guys don't
remember that that was basically you
either poor dice on yourself or you
donated money if you were tagged so
logical donated money and it also raised
a lot of awareness for ALS which then of
course more people donating money and
stuff like that so we are what's up
closer that is awesome that is something
incredible another great thing that
happened is that new chemotherapy
breakthroughs have increased the
five-year survival rate from sixteen
percent to twenty-seven percent for
pancreatic cancer that is incredible I
know a lot of people that have struggled
with cancer and it is absolutely
devastating so to find out that we are
in 2016 and we made almost we made
eleven percent increase and find it
increasing the rate of the five-year
survival is just praise God thing and
Ebola did suck this year but because of
Ebola now it says that systems are now
in place that speed up development and
delivery of vaccines for the next
outbreak so hopefully we don't have
another output but if we do we have two
vaccines for the next one so it's not a
huge freak out like this year it was
another great thing in 2016 is that
child mortality rate is down all over
the world so this is not just the US
this is not just in certain countries it
is down everywhere which is something
that definitely is good about 2016 and a
good thing is that the Pokemon go
epidemic came out and actually a lot of
people set up lers in hospitals where
sick kids could play pokemon go just in
their hospital beds and it brought a lot
of joy to people i've seen so many
videos somebody posts everything like
that so all these adults that are saying
how crazy people are in this generation
for being on their phones and that's the
only way this again and get active you
know why it brought a lot of smiling
faces two kids in hospitals so I think
that is a really really great the great
thing that happened is that Starbucks
figured out a safe way to donate
perishable food restaurants draw out so
much of their good food and I always
think like why can't that be delivered
to
great people or like starving kids or
anything like that but it is because
food is perishable so you can't really
deliver it in that safe of a way but
Starbucks actually found a way to do it
so that is awesome also in massive
strides in Alzheimer's prevention which
is great because that is a very very sad
heartbreaking it disease that a lot of
people actually suffer through and seen
your loved ones go through it so it's
awesome that they're having massive
breakthroughs in preventing that another
great thing that happened is that two
brothers actually stopped color for the
first time due to these specially
designed glasses so the fact that we
have the technology that people can
actually see color that could not see
color before is just show them anything
so I know there's a lot of bad things
that happen with technology and there's
a lot of bad things that happen in the
world but that is something that really
deserves celebrating yet another good
thing on the news was that 200 strangers
actually attended a homeless veterans
funeral so the fact that 200 strangers
went to some man you know what I didn't
even know just shows that we aren't all
loved and we are all careful even if you
don't really like that you are you are
don't ever forget it and another great
thing that happened is that toys r us is
actually offering quiet shopping our
four kids with autism so that's great
for the kids with autism can actually go
to toys r us without all the hustle and
bustle and aren't afraid and aren't
don't have any like panic attacks or
anything like that so I think that's
awesome for toys r us for actually
recognizing that and doing something
about it those are the things that
happened in 2016 in the world of course
those are only a small small handful I
will actually link the list of the
tumblr thing that I got a lot of this
off of down below there was also a
reddit thing that I think the girl from
tumblr got it off of so I'll link both
of those down below definitely read it
if you get a chance because I think we
all need to be reminded that there are
actually good things in the world even
when it seems like there's literally
nothing good there are I prom now 10
things that happened to me in 2016 this
is where I want you guys comment 10
things that happen to you in 2016 that
were great I know she doesn't succeed my
up sucked or a lot of you guys it
honestly was one of the worst years for
me too but there are a lot of good
things about it so I want to list out
all the good things that happen one of
them was that I had an internship this
summer that was awesome because as
College internships are a great way to
boost your resume their great way to get
future drawers and I actually got one so
that was pretty cool another great thing
that happened is that my youtube channel
grew to over 50,000 which is so funny
because if you watch my new year's goal
my new year's resolutions video in
January I actually said that one of my
goals was to hit 50 K and we even
surpassed that so thank you guys I love
you it's the next a good thing that
happened to me was that I actually got
into a workout routine so if you also
watch my new years ago that was my new
year's resolutions and I actually really
got into it I don't think I've gone more
than like two weeks this whole year
without working out which is incredible
and I actually have like a regimen this
now I'm kind of slacking off but like I
actually stuck with it throughout the
most of the year so I'm really proud of
myself for that another great thing that
happened was i turn 20 another year and
that's always a good thing another good
thing that happened was that I made a
lot of amazing friends this year and I
also found out even though I lost a lot
of friends and I was going through some
drama with that I found out who my real
friends are which is way more important
than losing some friends that actually
you're not in the long run you're like
I'm glad that you're not in my life
another good thing is that started the
year with my best friend and I'm ending
it with line at which you guys don't
know I'm in a relationship but yeah so I
started it with him and I'm gonna give
it another good thing is that I have
learned to be proud if things that I do
that I love like youtube I used to not
be proud of I used to be really
embarrassed and no one really understood
what would make fun of me but now if you
follow me on social media you better
believe that I'm posting basically 99%
of it about that and if you wanna follow
me you can but I'm not gonna hide about
the things that I absolutely love do the
thing is I've learned a lot of new
skills like photography has taken up an
interest of the past like two months and
if you want i actually made an instagram
for it just because i don't want to stay
on my real instagram with photography
things so i have like two followers and
it's like me and my sister but if you
want to follow it i will link that down
below to down me a lot to me and
supporting me in that another great
thing is I didn't fail any of my classes
um I always want to congratulate myself
for making out of school and other two
semesters so far and then another thing
is that i spent another year with my
family which is awesome everyone's
healthy everyone's good we're all alive
so that's nice and the last good thing
of that happened this year well let the
last good thing for the last good thing
that i mentioned i will mention is that
I am healthy i have been healthy the
school year and i am alive i think that
is something that all of us should have
in our list that we made it another year
so i hope that this video brought some
positivity in your life or I don't know
just like put a smile to your face or
something like that but I just want to
do this because I feel like there's a
lot of negativity and like bad things
that have been happening in the world
and i want to bring more of a positive
light and do it I guess and also when I
went on youtube this morning all I saw
was black friday hauls and I was just
like a new man barely went I like barely
went black friday shopping and got like
two candles like a pair of shoes so
that's my hall for you guys and I just
thought that I don't know I want to do
something more in the aspect of like
Thanksgiving and not shopping as much so
yeah and be sure to subscribe give this
video a thumbs up if you guys liked it

10 good things that happen in your life
this year I'll see you guys next week
