with my friend John right it goes the
UNC Chapel Hill and he appears to help
me with my why I chose business video
which was one of the most requested
videos in the comments from all my other
ones if you guys are new here please be
sure to subscribe down below and also I
do these college type videos every
single Tuesday so be sure to subscribe
to that and then on Fridays if you like
my main channel videos with my regular
ones not college related but the dress
was super busting so I have drawn here
to answer all my questions for me and
we're going to get another friend of
ours but he backed out so far it's only
one this time answering with so if you
guys are new to these videos I basically
just asked the person that I have on
here questions about their major what
they want to do with it
they regret it all that kind of stuff
and just to give you some more insight
on the specific major because I know a
lot of you guys are going to college
soon or just curious and want to know a
lot about just different majors in
college so today we're talking about
business slash econ right yep yeah so
the first question is what is it so what
is business and what is economics
what is business then this is pretty big
actually that's the thing you can go
into finance accounting marketing you
know banking which is involved finance
consulting and there's so many different
fields of business that's probably the
biggest strength of the major applied
shows at least because going into
college I didn't know exactly what I
wanted to do I'm assuming most people
don't either I know what to work with
numbers I knew wanted to be like somehow
in management I want it to be a leader
of some organization or certainly a
business maybe later on so business was
a place to start yeah super broad you
can go into a lot of things with it and
John Becky go into accounting okay
I work for an accounting firm now but I
do more consulting with them so it's
pretty cool accounting super tech
technical I think so I explain it now in
accounting is what's accounting so I
work very impressive RL Cooper's PwC
they're one of the big four accounting
firms and they do it variety of
different services you have like a tax
final service which is helping companies
out with how to pretty much find the
best way to allocate their taxes or
level sure with tax
I don't even associate with that sass
refer and then you have audit where you
deal with you know fortune 500 companies
that are public and each years need to
submit the financial statements so big
four accounting firms and other
accounting firms will pretty much check
the validity of all their numbers so it
when investors see it they know that
okay
PwC checked them off their audited you
hear audits all the time
individual people get audited companies
and then lastly the third part is
consulting like the advisory side of all
these firms and that's kind of where I'm
in right now or welcome assault firms
before they get on it will consult them
about or at least my team specifically
with any kind of transaction it's really
cool actually mergers acquisitions
companies having IPOs
it's really nice stuff so they see on
the news and like my groups part making
that happen now so why he looks like
this cuz he just came back from work so
each on this well actually different
things yeah my bit my majors are just
Business and Economics a double major in
econ is I originally thought it will be
similar to business my econ that's the
same thing all business but no econ is
essentially studying the past so you can
predict the future what's going to
happen in markets the politicians use a
lot of econ and it's a great way to
understand the world if you understand
econ we really can apply those
principles to you even like your day to
day actions the the cost of me driving
to work the benefit of that it's a
really comprehensive way to understand
business world in general the second
question is why did you choose business
/ econ we kind of touched on that like
why yeah I just didn't know exactly I
wanted to do but I don't want to be
successful so I as I want to just open
up with many pathways to success as I
can and business was the way to do it I
wanted to do engineering at one point so
yeah I knew I liked numbers well they
had the top number that I want to be a
lawyer probably not like in politics so
with both business give me numbers at
all figuring out then as I got older I
just found out what what my friends
parents were doing and saw the lives
they were living and I asked them some
questions yeah people questions that's a
good tip yes then again
one two people that you want to be like
questions about how they got there you
get the school you like I want to work
for Goldman Sachs make a hood $7 out of
college
we don't just you know make that happen
at the end of college when you're
applying to jobs you have to kind of set
these goals year by year to get there
yeah get internships I'd try to get them
at good company is starting at sama
company but you want to work for in the
future
a lot of times they hire you if you had
an internship like they'd hire the
interns or the next year so that's so
important and get one in the city that
you like company that you like cooking
and then the next question is do your
graduating business know just because I
don't know what else I would do to be
honest so I got our only have a passion
for medicine or politics or anything
else and so I really just love numbers I
love solving complex problems and I'm
not naive enough to think that I know
exactly what I want to do right now
because in ten years Roman lineal so not
all of us but others are going to bounce
around a lot and change our career so I
think I want to get past it and it's a
very broad one you don't know what you
want to do you can try that out
obviously if you like literally have no
interest in order then maybe not but
it's very like you can literally go into
anything if you major in business and
then the next question is the type of
jobs that you can get with your degree
business you can if you have a maximum
business degree of Business
Administration you can do anything you
can go into finance you can go into
accounting consult any base and kind of
things I mentioned earlier is it hard
though because there's so many people
that like because there's businesses
like the most popular major I think I
exactly started here and there's like
only so many jobs yeah you can there's a
lot of jobs but there's still so much
competition you could work for any
company and like just do business or
like beyond like a management track to
speed executive for that company but if
you want to actually do it a specific
field like work for a strong financial
firm like a bank or big four accounting
firm it's very competitive and you have
to kind of either get in there early
with an internship or not to be cliche
you know so yeah yeah I'm not accent
connection so don't burn any bridges
doesn't make connections
at your university normally the faculty
has worked before like normally
professors aren't just professors
they've actually done other things so
you can meet your preference you can ask
other like you can say with family
friends or anyone like that but
definitely make connections I'm like
LinkedIn how do you connect yeah so I
just linked it all the time I think
barely used liked it I need to like get
off the cart it's like barely ever
usually if someone who you know is
really smart you don't like them or
that's a terrible example boat not like
my closest friends there in that
acquaintances bubble you know and then
you don't want to cut ties beating that
person because that person works for
company that you are interested in later
on and what oh you know we're still
close to our friends were I can reach
out and say hey could you fast I'll
resume all into HR something yeah wise
wasn't our only business
yeah good at goodbyes in percentages on
what type of jobs can you get and just
like a plant econ major business a lot
of people will do ecommons double major
and political science love under school
friends and you can go straight to
politics because a lot of little
decisions people make about the economy
and it's good to actually understand
what's going on with your systems are
impacting what you can do to kind of
make things better if you understand
where the right now so politics
definitely financial analyst of stock
broker if you love the stock market be
cons even once a major for you because
you have to be predicted you're not
gonna have a black and white answer like
accounting you need to have foresight so
stock market job financial analyst
banking that's more like the Etan bubble
to me you have to go to grad school you
think for econ yeah yeah usually they
say you have to go to yeah I'd like to
call most major industries yeah that
it's good to go it looks a lot better if
you go and get your masters because
there's a lot of competition and that if
you don't have your masters you're kind
of gonna fall behind
you don't necessarily but it's a good
thing if you're thinking about choosing
and the more you can you take you
realize that it's such a big topic
there's so many civic niches of it like
labor economics or health economics the
way people's insurance premiums are
charts following economic foundation the
way taxes are decided it's all we talk
so we're adding another type another
question to these last video a bit of
this I
I have this question and I got a good
response so what did the classes do you
take in college we're seniors by the way
so we're about to be seniors in college
which is really weird but we haven't I
got three years of experience with
classes so was it was awesome to take
take the prereqs to classes you know
they so counting most business majors
have to take one econ class at least
just kind of understand basic supply and
demand of you know product there's a
business communication class most
schools offer an hour you they teach you
how to be a better public speaker
they'll record you kinda like this as
you can see all your your quirks and all
the things you're doing I do dis etad
and I talked really fast and probably
doing it now all the things I've learned
inside it situations we'll take a class
on resume building usually interview
skills that you turn into a cover letter
take a finance class and then there's a
lot of what did you can take stock
classes this class that class and crops
we learn how to make things up on the
spot business version there's a class
for that repetetive ended up also John
got to a liberal arts school so you do
have more flexibility with your schedule
in terms of electives like for me
personally I don't have any other
options to shake left like I know I have
to take all the classes like I don't
have anything that's my NPC progressed
the rest is already decided for me so
that's the difference between like a
liberal arts school and a more technical
like stamping all your classes we all
yes 200 cars I was just lost out why me
I don't have any flexibility in my
schedule besides for like freshman
sophomore year choosing my list
humanities and diversity and stuff so
that witless downside is because I don't
have that much fun familiar if I'm
actually interested in the subject I
can't take it because it's either like
if you're not in that major than you
can't take it but with econ you take
microeconomics where you look at like
the small details were firm like the
cost of labor and cost of capital and
how you can allocate all your money and
then you have macroeconomics which is
like the whole economy
Oh taxes go up what happens to the price
of good is it all just abroad so I took
like a European economics class which is
awesome when you like individually look
at every tension
like where and what they do that's
different every other country
tell ya what school do you I would be s
ik s ik University or a big business
school parent right outside of Paris
okay so any of you are from there
comment down below maybe you guys even
grow that school and that'd be so cool
if you guys are watching this so we went
down below if you're from France Paris
or go to his country
thanks ed or awesome I think I do for
these videos it's a the best
universities for undergrad for business
so I look to be the first one in the
University of Pennsylvania which that is
an Ivy League school and I feel like
that's a very popular one with Wharton
School of Business for you Penn and then
the second one is MIT which I didn't
realize MIT was that good at business
and I'ma third is UC Berkeley which in
some of the other ones that we talked
about other majors is Berkeley was on
there so I feel like Berkeley is just in
general a really really good school and
I want to look up this econ I think
these are all really bad list because
UNC voucher USC has about any of the
list
so like grateful surprised when I had
great experiences and wasn't for
journalism or econ these are global
universities the first one is Harvard
the second one is MIT again and then the
third P pen so UNC on here and no it's
not it's nothing
