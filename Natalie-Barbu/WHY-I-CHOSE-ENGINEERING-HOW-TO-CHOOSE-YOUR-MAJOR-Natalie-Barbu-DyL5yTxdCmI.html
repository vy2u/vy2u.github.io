throwing a very exciting video today so
this is going to be the first video in
one of the series that I am starting I
realize I have about one year left in
college so I want to make as many
college related videos as I can while
I'm still in it at home just because I
feel like they help a lot of you guys
out and a lot of my viewers most of them
are actually in college right now or
going into college so I just really want
to kind of inform you guys on my college
experience other college experiences
just the different options that you guys
can take because college is definitely
not a straight line there's so many
different ways you can go about it and I
know when I was going into college I did
not have anything like this to look at I
looked at so many websites but I looked
at a lot of websites that are kind of
older people write them or just more
like raiding some stuff like that I
would love to have known more as an
actual person in college informing me on
the questions that I had so that is the
start of the series throughout the
summer I want to kind of talk about
different majors and the paths that you
guys can go why you would choose that
major or why others treat that major I'm
also going to talk about kind of how I
chose and seascape or other colleges how
how you guys can choose the college you
guys want to go to how you guys can
choose your major just trying to help
you out in any way I can because I know
college is such a confusing process and
it's really really hard to kind of make
a decision it's going to impact you for
the rest of your life so I'm here to
help the first video that I am when we
doing in this series is how I chose my
major and I'm doing the engineering
addition because that is my major I'm
actually going to be asking a couple of
my friends to star in these videos and
ask them how they chose their major and
the same format and I'm doing this video
so if you guys want that please give
this a thumbs up I would love for you
guys to give that a thumbs up just so I
know that you guys want to see these
videos any other how to college videos
or making decision videos or anything
about college please leave in the
comments below because I really do want
to make this a series so kind of like a
how I blanks how I chose engineering how
I chose where to go to school how I
whatever
um so I would love you guys to do that
and also list the other majors that you
guys want firstly I'm just going to
start it is how I chose engineering so
if you guys are new here thanks so much
for watching and clicking on this video
and please subscribe if you guys want to
go Isis videos every Tuesday and Friday
and so you guys don't wanna miss out on
this series definitely do that you guys
can follow me on all my social medias if
you want to know me more but without
further ado let's get into the video so
I have my handy notes right here that I
wrote down and I kind of have bullet
points on the topic I want to talk about
to kind of keep it organized so all the
videos have the same theme question I'm
going to be asking is what is
engineering so I actually wrote down a
definition that I found on the internet
and then I'll kind of put it into my own
words so the definition that I found was
if the application of scientific
knowledge to solving problems in the
real world so that is essentially the
easiest way to describe engineering it
is just solving problems its
problem-solving it's making things more
efficient it's making companies worry
less because they have an engineer on
the job that's kind of how I view it
I view engineering basically as making
things simpler and making it better
engineering makes everything kind of
better I guess it's kind of like a very
broad statement but I think that's the
best way to describe it it's a lot of
scientific application though so it's
everything is through logic through
science it's not just like intuitive
it's very logical I think that is like
such a hard major because you have a lot
of pressure on kind of making things
better like civil engineer to build
bridges like they really need to know
their stuff that the bridges don't
collapse when a bunch of cars are on it
you know so it's just a lot of science
and logic and physics and just applying
your knowledge to real-world problems
why I chose engineering that is the
second question that I'm going to ask
and I chose personally engineering
because I wanted a very broad major so I
wanted a major that wasn't going to
limit me I know I have talked about this
before but I was between fashion and
engineering which a lot of you guys are
probably like what I know totally
different they are so so different
they're not even close to being related
together but
I really loved fashion so grant and I do
this YouTube channel which has become a
fashion videos and makeup and stuff so I
very love fashion so that's why I was
like I kind of want to work with that
but then I also was thinking that I want
a major that is more broad and I can
apply my knowledge and also challenge
myself because I want it to be
challenged in high school I always took
pretty like hard courses I think I took
about seven seven AP courses in high
school um so I did that and by no means
you need you didn't take seven AP
courses is not only you cannot be an
engineer like no that's not that means
but um I always kind of like challenging
myself I never wanted to be in the
easier classes I always want to push
myself and work hard and that is why I
also chose engineering clay knew it was
a great degree that would challenge me
and be hard but like I would be rewarded
afterwards you know with fashion and it
was very very broad or not broad so it
was kind of like I was stuck in fashion
like if I wanted to do another job later
on in the road ten 15 years down the
road I mean by that's when I probably
could at the experience I have but in
general I'm kind of stuck in like I'm
only studying fashion box and I did not
want that so those of you who are
studying is good for you I think it is a
great major but that was just my thought
process behind it and then I wanted
something that I knew would be secure so
engineering is obviously one of the most
secure jobs right now if you guys look
at like the top jobs for graduates from
last year they're all in engineering or
computer science I also really really
liked math um at kana like science but I
really liked math in high school and I
knew that I was good at it I was a very
very logical person I was very numbers
driven
I am extremely numbers driven I like
like thinking in numbers I don't like
writing papers I don't like reading
essays I always did way better on like
that math portion of the SAT than the
English writing section so that was just
the way my brain worked and I knew
engineering was greatest that also of
both my parents are engineers so they
definitely influenced my decision and
they didn't make it for me but they did
influence it I have an older sister and
she didn't go into engineering but I saw
what they did and I thought it was a
cool job I also wanted to work in a big
company and I knew every single company
needs engineers that is actually
literally every single reason I thought
of and I was like hmmm I guess this is a
good thing to do I didn't really have
any other options but fashion
hearing and because I wanted all of
those things that I listened engineering
fits the mold the next question that I'm
going to be splitting this video is you
and do I regret my decision so whenever
I have other people I'm going to be
asking them like do to regret majoring
in bit so for me personally no I do not
regret it but a lot of you guys have
asked like why are you doing engineering
because I have said before is that I
personally right after college I don't
really want to get an engineering
related job which I know a lot of you
guys are like what why are you doing
this video okay hear me all right so I
don't really want to get into an
engineering related job because I have
done I have become very serious on
YouTube this summer or nothing summer in
college I have like really devoted time
to YouTube I really really love it and I
do it all while doing college which is
possible guys all of them like rude
comments on my last video look like I'm
kidding all right guys hello Here I am
I'm above a 3.0 and I'm still doing it
so sorry those are like my two the
haters comment of the video anyways I
definitely haven't realized how much I
love YouTube and how much I love working
with different companies and I love
working on like creating content for you
guys and I love marketing like I don't
know I don't use you in marketing kind
of go hand in hand because YouTube is a
new form of advertising and like
Instagram social media and all that
stuff and I just like really have grown
in connection with the companies I've
worked with and the people that I've met
through YouTube and I have become in
love
so that is why YouTube has drawn me so
much more to kind of dislike creator
content creator entertainment marketing
all kind of an air quotes life and so I
have I feed after college I want to
focus more on YouTube not be a full-time
youtuber necessarily but because I can't
right now but I just wanted to be
something in a more creative industry
don't want to work in a warehouse they
don't want to be working a manufacturing
plant I don't want to be in a cubicle at
this moment or at least like not a
boring one I don't know I know that's
like typical of millennial like once
working to open houses
whatever but I really do want to be more
in a creative environment which is what
YouTube has allowed me to do and through
YouTube I've actually realized how much
I love it and all while realizing that I
was sending engineering so these like
paths are going side by side but they're
not really like aligning so I have to
choose yes so I have to choose one of
the paths and I think after college I
want to focus more on the YouTube path
that doesn't mean I'm not going to get
my degree that you guys heck no I have
worked my butt off for three years I'm
getting my engineering degree but that
just means that I am going to try to
pursue another path and then later on
the road they'll have my engineering
degree so like it's definitely not going
to come to waste and I feel like with
engineering it is so broad and I'm going
to industrial engineer for those who are
going to ask in the comments below I'm
an industrial engineering so and that
one is a more like business engineering
so it kind of does add up a little bit
like it's more I can become in
management I can do business with it so
I think that I definitely don't regret
my decision though because I have gained
a lot of skills which I've gained a lot
of problem-solving skills I'm definitely
more logical I feel like I am so much
more of like a smarter person in general
and when I came into college like I
think of things a little differently and
I think that is an advantage in life in
general so I don't regret it at all
it is hard and there's definitely days
where I do cry and I'm like why did I do
this I know the skills engineering
equips me with are definitely going to
help me out in the real world so I'm
happy about that
the next question in this video is what
type of job can I get so I'm going to be
talking I like the job that you guys can
get in engineering so for me
specifically I am an industrial engineer
so I'm mainly talking about that but
with engineering all companies need and
shares literally all of them need
engineers this video and very broad
because engineering is very broad like
they're simple there's mechanical this
industrial there's biomechanical there
aerospace there's literally so many
different types of Engineering's out
there that all like the jobs are so like
different you can work actually in any
company at all so if you're doing
computer science engineering that's
definitely more coding and working with
software development if you are doing
civil engineering that's more working on
roads and bridges I know that's like
there's so much ones they can do they
can do construction stuff like that if
you're working with industrial like me I
have them written out free day for me
specifically I said that all companies
need industrial engineers basically all
of them do many go into the business
world you can be a project manager you
can work in management you can do supply
chain you can do grading it off you work
in like the risk assessment or risk
analyst you work with fraud if you
remember credit card company that's what
my mom actually did my mom's also in
high E and she worked at American
Express she worked in the fraud
department you can work with statistics
because in social engineering is a bank
statistics heavy load sometimes we kind
of talk you can do the main things get
out of it is that any company needs one
and you're basically making things
better for the company and every company
needs that so guys why it's a pretty
stable and secure degree to go into and
then at the end of every video like this
I'm going to give you guys the top three
best universities for your major or for
this majors specifically so I just will
stop best engineering undergrad schools
and I got this from US News and I think
they're a pretty like legit ranking site
so the best one no surprise here is MIT
the second best is Stanford and the
third best is UC Berkeley so if you look
at any of the schools and are sending
engineering compress you're one of the
top three in the country you must be so
smart and please leave a comment below
if you guys have ever visited the school
or if you go there or if you know anyone
that goes there how your experience is
if you guys are in engineering or
thinking going into it haunt down below
at school you go to or which one you
want to go to I really hope that this
serious pick trap and that you guys
really like it because I feel it I want
to help you guys a lot because I know
how stressful college is
I know it's like definitely such a big
decision and I want to help you guys as
much as I can for those of you guys who
are new year and don't really know a lot
about me I am Natalie hi I have a dress
best I'm 21 years old I'm going to be a
senior in court I'm a senior in college
ooh so weird and I am studying
Industrial Engineering like I said and I
go to NC State University go Wolfpack
guys so I hope you guys enjoyed this
please make sure to comment the other
majors that you want because I guarantee
I have a friend in that major or I can
find one and have them be in this video
I really might help you guys out I'm so
excited for the series because I know I
have one year left and I really wanna
help you guys as much as I can so please
