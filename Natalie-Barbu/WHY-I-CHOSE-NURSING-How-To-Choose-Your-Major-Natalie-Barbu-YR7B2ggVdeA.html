I am with my older sister hey I'm Martha
if you guys have not hooked up with me
for the last few weeks I've been doing
this thing called college Tuesday's so
it's basically where I talk about every
major or not every major but I've talked
about a lot of majors and just why the
person I had I always have like the
little guest with me that is in that
major or has completed it and I just
asked them about it what it is what you
do with it and it's just meant to help
you guys kind of out like seniors in
high school or people in college or
anyone's curious about different majors
to kind of help you guys decide what you
guys should do and why you should do it
or if you're just curious it gives you a
lot more information about it this week
we are doing why I chose nursing and
here we have a nurse with us who she's
actually a nurse who's completed it
she's been grad school already so we are
gonna have her talk about just one
nursing is and why she chose it and I
was actually one of the most requested
ones so yeah give this video a thumbs up
you guys are interested in this if you
guys are new here please be sure to
subscribe I will also have all of this
down below but if you don't don't even
care about college related videos I do
my normal videos on Fridays so I post
twice a week so be sure to hit the
subscribe button and give this video a
thumbs up because nursing was the most
requested video so this is my sister
like I said so just tell us like a
little backstory of like nursing I don't
about you okay so I'm the oldest sister
the one that a lot of you probably don't
know exists I am 27 and I'm going to
nurse for four and a half years I went
to college at UNC Charlotte here in
North Carolina and I've been working on
a surgical unit at a local hospital and
I've been working on the same unit since
March of 2013 I work on a surgical unit
and it's been great I see a lot of
different things
basically all surgeries except the heart
and the brain so it's been a great
experience I am currently in grad school
like Natalie said for nurse practitioner
and I'll be done in August so almost
almost seeing the light at the end of
the tunnel still a ton of stuff to do
but
it's gone by really quickly that was a
two year program after undergrad okay so
now that you know a little bit about her
and yes I feel like so many of us don't
even know I have an older sister here
she is there you can watch my blog when
you might but I'm not sure so the first
question that you start off with all of
these videos is why or what is it - what
is nursing so nursing is a service
career basically we take care of
patients when they're sick and not only
their patients but the families as well
it's kind of a double a double career
because you got your the support system
for the family also and we basically
help them heal well I guess yeah
basically this is when you see a nurse
like I feel like a nurse and just like a
when you go to the doctor you see what
nurses are you do different things
that's a good point
um nurses that we see at the doctor and
at the hospital have a little bit
different tasks so the ones at the
doctor's office are usually what you see
like they're taking your vital signs or
they're you know giving you the shots
and we're coming to talk to you so it's
a hospital it's a little bit different
we take a ton of patients at a time your
12-hour shifts day shift or night shift
and we hand out medications all night or
all day depending on what unit you're on
and we're also taking care like I said
of the family as well and you know
really assessing the patient taking care
of the patient making sure that they're
staying stable so they can go home and
the next question is that why didn't you
choose nursing I chose nursing it will
let me backtrack so it wasn't ever
something where like my I want to be a
nurse when I grow up I never had a
career really that I said this is what I
want to be when I grow up maybe a
princess or something I guess
their kid but I would never really I
want to be a nurse I don't have anybody
that's a nurse in my family although my
grandma my mom's mom she is the doctor
so she was very proud of me whenever I
decided to do that but really I guess
what led me to that was Nursing is a
great career and it's really a great
kind of you can go anywhere with it you
don't only have to stay nurse you can go
into management you can go into the
provider role unlike an advanced care
provider which is what I'm doing there
are a lot of different avenues you can
take but basically as I'm the oldest and
I'm significantly older than you guys I
guess I always had that maternal role so
I felt like it was really appropriate
and I've been mission trips in high
school and I love I have you know love
serving people so I felt like that was
kind of a really good combination and
that's kind of where that came about
well he started with biology I did so I
originally wanted to go to dental school
that was you know when I was in high
school I decided I was going to be a
dentist and so but for dental school you
need any kind of undergrad so I
originally started as a biology major
because most people in dental school
that's one of the ones that they would
do and a third as a biology major and
basically failed the first bio class the
first biotech I didn't even last one
whole semester I think I maybe lasted
like two weeks and then I withdrew I was
like this is not for me if I end up with
a biology degree and I don't end up
going to dental school for whatever
reason this is not something I can fall
back on I was either going to work in a
labyrinth at is not me so I sat back
down and reassessed my situation and
nursing came upon you know I came upon
nursing and I thought that's a really
good fallback career if I end up staying
in it that's a great career to be in
because again there are different
avenues you can take but if I go to a
dental school obviously that works too
so that's how I came upon nursing major
the next question is do you regret
choosing this
no I don't but there are good days and
bad days there are some days that I want
to run away really fast and don't not go
back to work
but some days like when you have a
patient who you didn't think was as
appreciative come back months later to
see you or they talk to you to your
manager about you to talk to your
manager about you you know give you a
good report and you didn't even realize
that they were or even if it was a
patient that was so great to you and you
loved you know being their nurse and
everything even those patients that were
kind of expected to give you a good
report even when they do that makes it
all worth it and then seeing their
progress as well and then what type of
jobs can you get with it so you kind of
touched on that but also let's talk
about what you're doing now like grad
school and like I said you can do a lot
of different things with it there's a
management role you know where you can
manage a unit and also you can end up
doing like a case management type of
role with it you can do working in a
doctor's office or Hospital and then
from that using that if you have your
bachelor's degree in nursing you can go
to an advanced role will again
management with the bachelors degree
continue to get your master's with that
and then like I said an advanced
practice role so a nurse practitioner
and you can do any any kind family nurse
practitioner is just general like the
ones you'd see in a doctor's office that
these kids and adults and you can
specialize you can do the intensive care
you can do the emergency room anything
like that so there are a lot of
different things you can do with nursing
and you're always going to have a job so
that's um that's the best part and then
the next question is the best University
so I actually looked that up on my phone
so the first best University or the
event university in the country for
underground nursing this is from USA
Today in Molloy College I've never heard
of that College in my life but in a
private liberal arts school that is
rooted in Catholic values so it just has
the nursing program immerses students in
the medical fields give them a well
rounded edge
I never heard of it but if you go there
let me know the second line is NYU and
then the third one and very troubling
that's ripping I know New York so NYU I
would love to go there that was like my
dream school and then the third is New
York I'll give you a 45 just put them on
here
fourth is University of Pennsylvania
which that is an Ivy League school and
then the fifth is George Washington
University which is in DC well I guess I
don't go to a top school yeah well it's
her undergrad so oh that's right yeah
okay I had four undergrad so if you want
to be a nurse there and also I never
added this into the questions I'm going
to ask but I think I'm going to start
asking this question to these videos and
what the classes you take as a nurse in
college oh my gosh though it's so long
ago um so definitely like your typical
prerequisites you have to take
statistics that's one of the ones you
have to take and then for what depends
so if you do a there's a difference
between just being an RN or registered
nurse and then having a Bachelors of
Science in Nursing as a registered nurse
that's what I did that's a four-year
degree so some people can get a nursing
degree from a community college and it's
just the same you end up working you
know you have the label as a nurse in
the end and they're great nurses I work
with a lot that don't have a bachelor's
degree where I have in the past but the
difference is a bachelor's in nursing
obviously it's longer so it's four years
versus two years at a community college
but it also focuses a lot on like
nursing theory and and like research and
that type of a thing so in the bachelors
program there's a couple research
classes you take like nursing research
in addition to your like physical
assessments like learning how to assess
the patient and medication learning
medications and learn about diseases as
well so there are a ton of different
courses and most of them obviously focus
on nursing but
there are also in addition like the
research courses that you have to take I
just want to ask that because when I
first started this series I started with
engineering and I didn't talk about the
classes because I actually have a whole
video on like the classes so that's why
I never added it but I wanted to add it
now let me add this
so with nursing though there is a
difference so in in the sense of a
difference between like other majors we
do clinical rotations as well so that's
like our practicum so every nursing
program whether it's just a two-year
program or a four-year program and same
with nurse practitioner we do at the end
of the semester we have a practicum
where we get clinical hours so we work
with a preceptor at a hospital or
wherever it may be usually at the
hospital though and we that's our
practicum we have to take care of the
patient and we kind of learn firsthand
side by side with with that preceptor
essentially how to be a hands-on nurse
stuff like the hands-on portion in
addition to like your labs and stuff
like that I just wanted to ask that
because when I first started this series
I thought it was engineering and I
didn't talk about the classes because I
actually have a whole video on like the
classes so that's why I never added it
but I wanted to add it now let me add
this
so with nursing knows there is a
difference so in in the sense of a
difference between like other majors we
do clinical rotations as well so that's
like our practicum so every nursing
program whether it's just a two-year
program or a four-year program and same
with nurse practitioner we do at the end
of the semester we have a practicum
where we get clinical hours so we work
with a preceptor at a hospital or
wherever it may be usually at the
hospital though and we that's our
practicum we have to take care of the
patient and we kind of learn firsthand
side by side with with that preceptor
essentially how to be a hands-on your
stuff like the hands-on portion in
addition to like your labs and stuff
like that but that's that's the
difference - we have X amount of hours
that we have to complete
and one last question just because we
have her here today and she's doing
nurse practitioner I just want to ask
what does intend to do in consenting was
already done nursing and they're trying
to decide or if you're going to join
everything but you know you want to go
to grad school to do something else
here's what does it do or what do you do
then oh well nurse practitioner is a lot
like a PA like a physician assistant
it's the only difference is every nurse
practitioner has been a nurse before
because you have to be a nurse prior in
order to be a nurse practitioner she is
doing that right now but she is at Duke
University in grad school right now and
she's studying to be a nurse
practitioner and she's almost done like
she said oh yeah we have a Duke purser
and we have an ending safer now uncp
photos yes nurse practitioners are they
work under a doctor I mean I think in
some states they already have and don't
quote me on this and I should probably
know this but in some states they have
already a lot in place where they can
actually under respected shrink and
practice without a doctor but this date
is not one of them but usually they work
under a doctor whether it's in the same
building or you just report to a doctor
but basically you are the provider so
there are a lot of people who now when
they go to the doctor's office like a
front in their primary care physician
their primary care doctor is a nurse
practitioner so you can prescribe you
can diagnose basically everything that a
doctor does essentially all of those
like basic things and you can work
anywhere you can work in hospital you
can work in doctor's office I don't know
what all all states have minute clinics
but we have a lot of them here in North
Carolina and most of the providers at
work in minute clinics are either nurse
practitioners or physician assistants
that's kind of stuff kind what they do
they take the lead and they take charge
and take care of you have like oh that's
cool yeah luckily and you get paid more
it's a nurse protection
perhaps not more than a doctor but more
than yeah whatever yeah
okay so that is basically all my
questions that I had if you guys want to
see all the other videos and definitely
clicked down below I'll have all of
those there and also unique request for
