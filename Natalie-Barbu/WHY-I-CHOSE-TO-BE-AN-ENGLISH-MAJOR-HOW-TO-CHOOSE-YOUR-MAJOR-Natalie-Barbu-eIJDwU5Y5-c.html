am filming another of the why I chose my
major videos I promise you guys that
this will become a series and I was so
excited because you guys come to so many
different careers or majors that you
want to talk to me about so I brought my
friend Katie hey you guys know her if
you watch any of my other videos or any
of my blogs she's in about 99% of them
so you guys definitely know her by now
yeah I just saw a YouTube video and I
was like what is that noise
she is an English major and actually a
college graduate bro this is totally
different from my engineering video so
I'm really excited to bring on people
with different majors because I feel
like all I talk about and all I can talk
counts as engineering the like I want
other people involved in other people's
answer your question so this perfect so
I'm gonna ask her the same exact
questions I asked myself when I was the
why I chose engineering videos if you
don't know here hi be sure to subscribe
you can also follow Katie on her blog
she has a blog herself I'll have that
linked down below follow those on
Instagram and now we're just gonna get
started on why Katie chose English as
her major
yes okay first question is what is it
like what it can see so an English major
means that you study literature you
study writing you study different
computing such grammar it's very
different facets of English language
there's different little avenues within
an English major so I chose a really
broad English major which means I
studied everything I have an option to
study any class but I was interested in
to get a grasp on the skills that I
would need to go further in my career
some of my friends within English
department shows more specialized majors
and literature or English as a second
language which is a seraph little
different of track so within the English
department there's a lot of different
flexibility within English majors that
you can choose whatever you're
passionate about so I chose the most
broad one so I can speak to different
facets of the department
different ways that you can use English
in your career to best Java classes and
project every type of class we do takes
in English department within both
schools that I went to actually started
an app state and then I transferred to
UNC Charlotte and I was an English major
at both schools yes so if any goods go
there then comment that down below so
I'd love to know where everyone goes the
next question is why did you choose
English so you were kind of touched on
that just like why in general you felt
called to be an English major so what I
love about English is that the
flexibility of the job market when you
graduate I went to college and I knew I
was really good at reading and we're
going to get it writing but I had no
idea what I wanted to do and what I
learned about myself is that when I
study I study a lot harder and a lot
more disciplined when I'm studying
things that I'm passionate about and I
knew that any other career comment I
chose I would not put in the timer
energy that I would have said in a size
on English and so I started a vlogging
actually when I was in high school and I
loved writing and wealth and writing the
Internet
I loved just putting my opinions up
being like contributing to different
websites so I knew that I wanted to do
something with writing of the careers
and the best way to do so and honing
your skills is to do an English
department so I joined in on no idea
like I was just saying what type of
route I wanted to take my mom studied
literature and she decided American Lit
so she's like well-versed in literature
but she didn't take as many growing
classes and I didn't want to just take
writing classes because I love
literature as well so I kind of explored
my options were started off of a
technical writing major and I realized
that it was a little too technical for
me I was way more passionate about
creative writing and literature and the
study of what you're analyzing things so
I decided to go for a general English
major one because of my credits
transferred easy that way and also to be
honest but also because it was really
interesting because I had way more
flexibility with my classes and I
realized in college that I wanted to
take classes that I was interested in so
I chose English but I thought about as a
career a lot of different ways to use
that degree I learned that throughout
the department that there's a lot of
flexibility which I really liked because
I would have a person that I knew that I
would not be able to fix to one job the
rest of my life I love changed I love
the ability to change and I was like
working on certain skills and moving up
and then changing so that's why I chose
it
um it's been a great decision so far
okay and then I don't want to talk so
like I'm like Ellen DeGeneres or
something like us you guys do you regret
it
this is like a weird question that I
asked myself originally because I have
at times regretted choosing my major but
like overall I don't regret it but
that's why I have that in for everyone
because I feel like a lot people go into
it and they are not actually realize
that they don't like it so I'm
definitely like I think for a lot of
people when you are in your make sure
you question it's the right thing for me
but then you're so far that you're like
yes because I'm not saying and I'm not
switching um I thought thing happened to
me at some times I was kind of like what
am I going to do with it
like being an English major requires a
lot of work and the job department
because you're not just graduating with
a job like oh did I work in computer
science that's a lot easier to find a
job that way or like I'm in a graduate
education degree so I'm going to go
teach right right away so it requires a
lot more hassle which I really realized
my senior year of college that I've
never done that before so that was
intimidating at first but honestly like
I'm the passionate about it if you're
passionate about English language and
literature and writing like honestly
like hone in those passions and people
appreciate people who can write well the
art of writing is kind of being lost in
our society so with people with English
degrees are actually really well thought
of within a company if you just have to
work harder to get the job so I think
that's probably the main thing that I've
learned and also
in my hesitation but I definitely
wouldn't choose anything else like I
can't imagine myself doing anything
pudding I feel like at the end of it at
the end of the day is kind of what you
love doing like yes if you yeah computer
science your gut guarantees like
basically guaranteed a job that is going
to pay very very well yes much easier
than like a psych major or an English
major or someone like that oh that's
just statistically speaking like that's
how the job market is but I mean Katie
like you would never want to do computer
science
what you know you ever never can ask me
anything Oh at the same time not it's
not all about munch leg-up don't choose
a major just because money of money yes
that's a big point you have to think
about it because obviously you need to
live in society and like have a house
and or pay your rent or pay or marvel
you know but like that like Katie said
like if you work hard you can do it if
you want to be an English major is
literally put zero effort after you
graduate college that's probably not
smart but that kind of goes you know
that kinda goes with every type of major
and especially don't do English if you
don't like it you know so true I know I
called a few my pastas they would
complain if I like writing so much or
eating so much times what's this going
to be like well this is a major that you
signed up for I mean this reality is
like I would read an average of 35 to 50
books a semester and write a ton of
pages made seen as kind of papers my
senior year but it's also like what I
love and if that's what you love then
maybe that's them in HD consider because
like if you love something you're going
to put the time and the energy towards
it it's going to be a lot more enjoyable
in the process and that's something that
I really learned is that my skills are
way more sharp after putting that energy
in but I wouldn't honestly like I know
myself I was not with the energy and if
it was like math or science I would
never ever try and not something that I
really had to learn about myself in
college was that you do what your past
is about and if you're not doing it
you're passionate about find a way to
make your passion
poor friend of your life you make money
or your ideal life that is what you're
shooting for and that's a like you're
not mixing your money with passion then
you're really not gonna be happy in that
money eventually it's not going to be
enough to drive you to work a card were
like you have to actually have some
interest in what you are doing like I
look at least remote internet you know
I'm like you don't even love it like
with all your heart but like you have to
be interested in it like you have a V or
else call it will be miserable for you
the next one is a type of jobs that you
can get with this major so this is
what's really cool and I actually didn't
know this when choosing my major so I'm
really glad that and I'm asking this
question with an English major there are
so many jobs that you can do it's
literally mind-blowing you can go into
journalism obviously that take a subset
it's more of a communications English
hybrid you can go into publishing
editing ghost writing that is a real job
right for other people put their name on
it yes but you pays well I'll be writing
you can write full-time except what
you're passionate about you can do
social media for companies you can
actually do grant writing you can teach
that's always a need in our society
you can tutor on the side you can
literally like the possums and listing
the local med school students actually
English students are actually being
accepted to med school now a lot more
because they're able to write a lot of
lawyers a lot of people that kind of
work odd jobs like a lot of
Communications jobs they'll express
English majors as well because it's
focus on communicating your ideas and
writing so there's a lot of different
like ways you can go about it which I
didn't know guys did the English that I
would like I don't know do I
you know and I kind of still in that way
everybody real high but like I figured
get out it's fine um but what I tend to
do is I decided like my last semester at
school I was going to go to grad school
and do calm as my strategic calmest my
gosh at degree and I realized that like
as much as I loved communications been
really passionate about communicating
with people
my passion is more for helping other
people learn how to communicate and even
though being a teacher isn't glamorous
and it's not something that I honestly
like seriously considered and so my
senior year my second semester senior
year I realized that like my passion was
English and my passion is helping other
people learn how to write and
communicate because it is such a big
part of college like if you're not in
college yet you will be writing papers
even if your master degree yes you will
be writing a blog rest of your life and
jobs and communicating with others is so
important so I really felt like I
personally want to be a high school
teacher so that is what I'm pursuing
right now I'm going to be doing some
work before I teach different odd jobs
but I will be ending up being a teacher
but you don't have to teach with an
English degree that's something that I
really learned that there are so many
option and people just really respect
the fact that you can communicate well
and communicate effectively so it's not
it's people get a lot of like a lot of
crap for choosing English is pretty
great honestly my channel becomes very
real like high people also respected my
feet you can communicate well and
effectively and it's not just a joke
major we hear that a lot like in the
department like oh what you're going to
do with your degree well there's
actually a lot of things you can do and
I think that's part of the heart the
hard thing about graduating with an
English degree means that there's so
many things you can do choosing one or
two is the hardest part so I've talked
to a lot of people in the department who
have taught to like really figure out
what it is that they want to pursue next
but that doesn't mean that they can't
pursue something else later in the
future who would not want tinia is their
high school in the future
oh my gosh he was going to be like and
the Freedom Riders or whatever that is
perfect little teacher that's like
running to help other than definitely
cares I don't know about you guys but in
high school I had teachers that
literally could not give two craps about
a food item you know and like it was
nice when I did have a teacher that
actually was cool and cared but also was
actually a good teacher you know so I
feel like Katy would be an amazing
teacher and you guys are enlightened you
it'll school now maybe you'll get a
chance to have her walking and we're
going to be like weird I love it I know
I agreed a small group at a church and
the ninth grade boys hit on me and I was
like this is legal because this is so
wrong with what I was like I'm like so
much order in the needle like Donny now
instead of just like a question I like
to leave this series was kind of like
the best universities in your major so I
found the three of them top 3
universities for an English undergrad
and I found this from Mitch calm so I
know how reliable that in the freezer
like inside a top 3 car number Lauren is
Yale chamber school yeah yeah Laverne is
Rory Gilmore come on r2 is Haverford
which I have literally never heard of I
don't even know what's me I'd never do
that yeah I don't know obviously the
governors of Harvard know Haverford's
like I don't know what that is in
Pennsylvania I know that
so I remember summer - for England
Hoffman if you go there yeah or to tell
her about it yeah love you tell us a few
minutes and three is Stanford which I'm
like Stanford is literally leaf golden
child like what are they not good at
