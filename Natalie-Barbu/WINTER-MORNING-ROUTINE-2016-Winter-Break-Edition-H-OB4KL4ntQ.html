routine so I am so excited to film this
for you guys this is my winter morning
routine and my holiday morning routine
is actually I believe my most viewed
video so hopefully this one can surpass
that you guys seem to absolutely love
morning routines so I decide to film
this for you guys and I also want to
make these always a little bit different
because morning and teens don't tend to
change that much each season so I tried
to make them a little different each
time so last one was my college one but
now I am home for winter break so this
is my winter break winter morning
routine I guess also my friends stuff
here on YouTube actually also made a
morning routine video today so make sure
you guys go watch her I'll have her
school links down below and follow her
on Instagram and she's also doing a huge
giveaway you guys so please go make sure
that you follow her and that you are
subscribed to her because her stuff is
so good like honestly I want to enter in
it but like if I even want I feel like
the would say it's rigged but whatever
it seriously so cool and it's such a big
giveaway so make sure that you enter in
that and if this is also your first time
seeing me hey guys I would love it if
you guys can subscribe i'm doing vlogmas
and normally not when I'm doing vlogmas
but like every other month of the year
I'd post twice a week so on Tuesdays and
Fridays so make sure that you guys are
subscribed to see that I have a lot more
videos coming up since it is winter
break
and yeah I hope that you guys enjoyed
this video and let's get into it
so this is me waking up in the morning
it typically takes me a little bit to
wake up but once I'm up I just kind of
like to get out of bed and start the day
I'm not one of those people that laze
around forever but my bed is just might
think a little bit and I don't know it's
winter break so I can chill for a while
so then I just head over to my bathroom
and I just wash my face and brush my
teeth but I moisturize err I love doing
that first thing in the morning because
I don't know about you guys but when I
wake up I feel like my skin is like
super dry and dirty and I don't know why
because I wash my face the night before
too but it just feels gross and leave my
teeth feel Grossmont morning breath like
really not cute so I just have to do
that first thing in the morning because
then I just throws my whole day off so
then I walk over into any kitchen and I
just make whatever I'm feeling I am NOT
one of those people that needs to be a
healthy breakfast I would love to say on
camera that every morning I eat avocado
toast but I don't you don't even have
avocados oh don't do that I do like it
though
but I just had some pastries they're
like Cuban pastries and I'm still happy
that we have them in North Carolina
because we do not have Cuban food here
in North Carolina so that's like awesome
because Publix came here which is the
best grocery store ever so they have
guava cheese and a beef pastry so I just
like mmm so good if you guys haven't
tried it definitely try it so I head
back this morning and I love certain I'm
wearing off with tea instead of coffee
because I typically get like a
compliment in the afternoon I'm Way more
of like a mid-afternoon coffee person
and a morning coffee person but I still
need my caffeine in the morning so I
just choose a tea and I make it into a
lot tonight by adding some almond milk
in it so then I just sit down and I
my makeup so I like having more simple
makeup but I didn't want to show you
guys because I'm actually about to film
and everyday winter morning routine so I
want you guys to watch that's it not
just watching this and enough people
need to watch that
so yeah it's lasts a lifetime to see
what I do every single day it is
essentially the same look sometimes I
changed little small things but overall
it's the same so yeah my skin gets
actually pretty dry in the winter time I
really like it to make a book and it
just makes me feel glowy even though
it's so cold wintery outside I just
always want to have like this then I get
dressed and I typically like to wear a
lot of darker colors in the winter I
honestly wear darker colors all year
round the light we're getting a good
excuse for darker colors so right now I
am wearing this top or this dress
actually it's like a PJ I think from
Urban Outfitters we really love it I
paired it with a shirt that comes with a
choker from Windsor I like the kind of
layered look and then I just have some
black tights on yeah I really like this
look I feel like it's kind of like edgy
and cool and I like how it has the shirt
underneath I'm feeling like kendall
Jenner vibes if you guys know what I'm
saying but then I normally head over to
Starbucks since my Wi-Fi is so slow at
my house and I end up just editing my
videos or just working on my laptop or
uploading whatever I need to since it's
December this is actually appropriate
because I'm doing vlog my so I'm
uploading every single day so I will be
here every day because my Wi-Fi is the
worst so yeah that's basically all I do
and then
is over and then I'm here for a few
hours and that's it so thank you guys
