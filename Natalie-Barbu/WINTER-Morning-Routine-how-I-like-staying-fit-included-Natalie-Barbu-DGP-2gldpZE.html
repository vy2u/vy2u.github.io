routine winter edition so right now you
can't really see anything because it's
super dark but I'm just waking up and I
normally wake up fairly easily because I
do consider myself a morning person um
doesn't mean that I look that hot while
I wake up but I do wake up pretty early
on a normal basis first thing I do when
I wake up is brush my teeth just because
I hate morning breath morning breath to
me is like the worst thing ever and I
just don't want to have that in my mouth
throughout the day so yeah first thing I
do is brush my teeth
and yeah that's what I look like
brushing my teeth isn't that interesting
you guys yep there I am just keep
brushing okay now you're gonna see me
spit so if you have kind of like a
problem mr. moon spitting then I was
just looking the way I included this
part is my morning routine and this is
what I do in the morning
next I change and I change into workout
clothes because the first thing I want
to do when I wake up is to work out just
so that I don't procrastinate and kind
of leave it off because if I do that I'm
never going to do it I do Blogilates so
she's awesome she's also on YouTube I
just follow her workout calendar exactly
how it is no matter how tired I am I
push through it and I just do it all
just because then I feel really
accomplished and I feel like I actually
got a lot of stuff done so today I'm
just doing her video hearing and working
out this is just a little part of the
video towards the end I'm probably doing
like wrong floor or something like that
but I try to do as best as I can this is
just an ab workout after I'm done
working out I just grab a water bottle
and I chug it this sports row makes me
look like a 12 year old boy I promise
it's really you know what how my body
looks in real life but yeah that sports
bras just not flattering at all it's not
even really a sports bra it's Monica
bando but anyways then I am going to my
Blogilates app actually and I just kind
of use this for inspiration and then I
use the recipe because I really wanted
to make a smoothie today because I feel
like smoothies are really good to drink
after you work out kind of as your
breakfast and as your post-workout snack
so I just kind of browse through them
and then add them if I want to do them
and yeah that's basically all I do in
the mornings when it comes to you food
wise kind of searching for food and then
I lay out my ingredients so we have
strawberries nonfat Greek yogurt
almond milk we protein whey protein
sorry Pam hempseed and I actually
substituted the hemp seeds for bananas
but all we're doing is cutting up my
strawberries and I washed my hands
before this I just didn't really show
that in the video and then I'm just
putting them into my Nature Boy
next I grab two tablespoons of nonfat
Greek yogurt and I put it into my
nutribullet as you can see
and next I'm taking half of a scoop of
whey protein and this is vanilla protein
powder and putting it on to my
nutribullet I was about to say applying
it cuz I thought it was you can make a
tutorial next I take one and a half
tablespoons of my hemp seeds I put those
in if I were you I would definitely use
bananas we didn't have bananas though
now I'm taking half a cup of almond milk
and putting that in
I love almond milk because it's low in
calories and I think it tastes better
than milk next I'm putting in five ice
cubes and then after that I'm just
screwing the top back on and blending it
all up
now I'm pouring my delicious smoothie
into my cup and what I like to do I'm
drinking my smoothie is just kind of
drinking in peace and just relax and
kind of scroll through my Instagram if
you guys aren't following me you totally
should it's at Natalie underscore Barbie
all the links will be down below anyways
if you guys just want to check it out
yeah follow me on Instagram so next
thing I do is I go up to my room and
they open my blind because my room is so
so dark with my mouth
I miss my blinds closed opening it and
just kind of letting the beers shine
through brightening up my room my room
is a total mess after I'm trying to
working out but don't worry thanks there
I am so much showered but yet don't
worry it gets clean whoa it just got
super clean haha power of editing me
guys and that wasn't even that great of
editing honestly next I hop into my
shower I just turn it on kind of wait
for the water to heat up which I know
well you're not really supposed to do
because that wastes water but I do it
anyways so I'm sorry um yeah and then I
just grab my robe once I hop out of the
shower and I kind of walk around in it
for a little bit
until I go to my closet for fashion time
so yeah this is my at-home closet and
definitely not like my college
closets so I'm just going to lay out
what I'm gonna wear so today's pic it's
actually jeans t-shirt from Windsor
abercrombie and fitch flannel and yep
then I'm brushing my hair with a wet
comb that's what it's called or wet
brush it's actually good for when it's
wet and it totally detangles your hair
without breaking it so I definitely
recommend this for everyone because it
is seriously a hair lifesaver you guys I
love it
next I'm putting in my Garnier leave-in
conditioner I cannot live without this
product it's my sworn by product for my
hair I always put it on after the shower
when my hair is really wet
and I can just apply a generous amount
and just kind of let my hair soak in the
goodness of it
then I moisturizing my face because I
wash my face in shower and my face gets
her it to dry after I get out shower and
after I wash my face and next I just
tend to edit a video that I have for you
guys and since I am uploading a ton more
I basically have a video to edit a video
or two to edit every single day and I
actually have a notebook that's helping
kind of what I'm gonna upload everything
so I'm basically pre recording
everything and uploading them at certain
times so definitely make sure to check
it out next time just watching a video
just for inspiration and also because I
love watching your videos then I'm kind
of off to get my day started I apply or
I keep something I applied I put on my
shoes and yeah I basically just put on
my shoes and grab my purse and hang out
the door
and now I'm getting started today so I
walk outside to my car and I just kind
of just run errands do whatever I feel
like I also didn't show you guys why I
applied foundation so check out my
foundation routine if you guys want to
see how I do my foundation next I go to
CVS I don't do this every morning I just
did this this morning and I can see
anything that I need for a makeup
tutorials so today I've seen you Kylie
Jenner inspired book so I decide to grab
some fake eyelashes and if you guys saw
that video you guys could tell that I
didn't wear your fake eyelashes because
the ones I bought sucked so I opted not
to wear that so this is kind of trippy
kind of like an inception thing because
I'm filming my morning routine while I'm
about to film my other videos so right
now you're kind of in the middle of my
other video if that's kind of cool if
you guys can guess what it is
by this makeup look go ahead except by
the time you watch this this makeup look
will already be posted because I'm
posting my morning routine after I post
what I just filmed if that makes sense
but anyways I hope you guys enjoyed my
morning routine video and make sure to
subscribe because as you can tell I'm
filming a ton and I have a whole bunch
of videos planned for you guys so yeah
give this video a big thumbs up if you
guys like it and again this is my
morning routine when I'm at home when
I'm at college it's a lot different so

college morning routine video too and
