Jesus because she makes sure that we
love Jesus because she loves
unconditionally and she just make sure
that I was about posting everything you
know sometimes I didn't like having to
stay home and hang out with the family I
understand that he did it because it's
so important for us to be close and me
tight as a family and it worked so thank
you for that thank you for letting me
stay home and high school in the middle
school when all my herds are going out
just so we could have like a family

encouraging and she pushed me because we
all know sometimes I need to be pushed

takes really good care of my dogs she's
always feeding them and walking them
talking to them a little mom because she
always takes me two more practices and

realized where I got my not a night
person from and it's you because I love
being in bed by looking at
but rather take a night in and then a
night out and I honestly thought that
would change in college but it just got
worse so that is all because of you she
has made a focus to make us a very
tight-knit family and it's worked and
always encouraging us to share and not
letting us not share her which be
annoying sometimes but I'm so thankful
for it I love that she's a good sense
fashioned I wish that a shallow but with
my hair my nails my chloe gets in a car

want to go and get food even when she's
tired it's way past her bedtime hello my
