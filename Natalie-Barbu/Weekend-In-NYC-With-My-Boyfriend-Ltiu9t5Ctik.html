already it's already about 11:00 I'm
Agnes Holland this morning
my last
I believe but yeah it's like you got
really good views to Manhattan and also
Brooklyn I'm excited to just like be
here look around maybe take some
pictures
yeah let me know any buzz and I'll show
you guys what we're doing there sir we
just took a tour of Governors Island it
was just of like a little area of
Governors Island not the whole thing
this it's pretty big and it reminds me
of a college campus if you guys have
ever been to like UVA or UNC this looks
so much like it and likes our houses we
wanted to remind me of old fraternity
houses and I was like oh it looks like I
could have a frat party and go to like a
party in here yeah that's what we just
did it's really nice or about to go to
the food trucks but I got bit like 20
times by mosquitos which like was not
fun at all my legs are really really bad
so hopefully the Zika virus isn't in New
York because the
I'm probably poisoned by it
there is the Statue of Liberty little
puny little thing and then we go over
here and we have what is this no I don't
know what that is and then over yeah
this happy New Jersey and then over here
we have Manhattan so this is like the
One World Trade Center is that tall
building
and maybe that's Staten Island I have no
idea what that is but yeah and then
right there so it's really pretty and
then on this side there is nothing
really that I think over there there's
like a drone racing ESPN is here and
they're having drones you guys can't
tell I got my nails done and like I'm
obsessed with I like pointing at things
because I have a song and now I'm just
like I love this town does anyone do any
of you guys like hey I almost miss my
flight cuz I was getting my nails done
have you been enjoying it yeah
I have to get that like get them to get
to know you better I'll ask you
questions we'll be asking some questions
to get to know him better along the day
so keep watching if you want to learn
more about my boyfriend this place is so
caring this subway station right now
date and we missed the first one we're
like we got I don't know it was like a
weird subway and skipped the stop
hello okay it's time to ask your one
question so
he doesn't like blogging in front of
people
I'll do it
you know even though it's more awkward
for me though because I don't know a
camera that like flips up so like I
don't see myself but everyone behind the
camera can see me
so I think that's like a little more
awkward if you guys understand that or
if you feel that but yeah I'm going to
get the g7x though after my camp of this
question number one do you like riding
the subway better than ubering
okay guys calm down below you go to
brother goober or take this inside
someone everywhere I think okay
personally I like cities now that I'm
here they're like have subway stations
it's just quicker easier cheaper paper
30 bucks for an unlimited subway pass
for the week and I think
my one uber trip from the airports like
my friend's house or my friend's
apartment was over $30 markets just
looking around but they're about to
close so they like took down a bunch of
it was like $15 I'm sorry just a t-shirt
like I'm not saying like like it was
literally a Hanes t-shirt for $15 oh my
god
they have them who says and if you guys
are from Central America that's like
typical Honduran Ecuadorian Nicaraguan
I'm pretty sure maybe Guatemala food I
really want
yeah
now it's someone's
something it's a stray dog
I could just watch this dog for like an
hour
you guys just look at this it's so
pretty this is we are in the Prospect
Park
I believe that's what it's called like
look at that Sun glare kind of cut there
it is there you got the glare you got up
up there there it is there it is we are
in this park
and I looked actually at my like steps
and stuff on my iPhone and we've almost
walked 10 miles today which is like
painful to hear and then we see a tunnel
oh look who's waiting for me at the end
of the tunnel he doesn't like being in
my vlogs if you can't tell do you like
this park better or Central Park this
one why there's less people did you hear
him cuz he's so quiet
he's mean I'm like sweating so much all
we found benches hallelujah we were
looking for a bench to sit in sit on
because like I don't have socks on you
know I honestly can't help that's like a
lake or if that's grass
wait that's a lake yeah can I like step
on it no ok guys wait that's a lake
that's not grass that looks like a mini
golf course that'd be really funny if
like someone was like oh like cute golf
course and then they walked in and they
just stepped in disgusting water that'd
be pretty buddy let's follow him on
Instagram what's your Instagram I don't
have a social mania yes you do Neil Eyre
I can just see my tag pictures of him I
think it's like see David it's 9:39 am i

mine in a beauty buying that that's oh

done like if your boyfriend doesn't know

with them there's not gonna be the
handle on YouTube live breakup at one
point yeah click mate me breaking up

at la terrain with grace we just woke up
early to come here and we just got some
friendships pictures with our bracelets

do Instagram
that's what I'm doing now follow me on
all of them so you can see behind the
scenes of stuff Oh
look at the CVS you guys it's like so
nice why is the ceiling like this this
is a CVS like a government building
or you like a train station it's a CBS
it's nice is your favorite part of the
High Line
like I don't know why families just
never thought to go really deep and it's
not even really deep in Central Park but
we've just never explored it that much
it kind of just looks around the outside
so that's what we're kind of like inside
of it right now it's really nice for in
some shades like forest area I want to
show you the boathouse we're gonna go
there and possibly rent a boat but it's
like super super crowded and Colin
thinks it's like bumper cars so we might
not do it because it is like very
crowded like the boats are all bumping
into each other it doesn't look that
crowded right here because there's not
any like right here but like they're all
in that area and I have to ask you a
question do you think about Central Park
okay fine
um nice asking questions down below and
then like he will respond to them
because I'll make him look up Maps so
I'm actually tell me to calibrate
actually using a compass to figure out
how to get to this castle because I know
it's north so currently we're not really
walking in the direction of north but I
feel like I'm like a crystal castle in
Central Park
it's really really really pretty the
views are just great the tram to
Roosevelt Island and I've never been
here either so this is a bunch of firsts
for me I've been to New York of a bunch
of times like I've never been to a lot
of these places so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
