the start of my Washington DC and vlog
it's super super windy right now we are
at Georgetown University so if any of
you guys go there make sure to tell me
because I think it is so so beautiful
it's really really cold and it's like
not sunny at all so that's why it's like
even colder yeah we just walked around a
little bit and now we are at these like
cute colorful houses really really
pretty I wonder who lives here do you
guys know who lives here let me know is
it I'd certainly not students it's way
too expensive for students but we
decided to take a little day trip here
so yeah it's really nice if you live in
DC let me know right now we are at Dean
&amp;amp; Deluca on and mystery I think this is
what this is it's like The Shops at
Georgetown so I am just drinking my Dean
yeah we're just sitting down it's super
super super cold outside I like my
french bulldog hat on and like scarf
they could jacket turtleneck like I'm
very bundled up but yeah I think we're
just about to go shopping we just walked
into a TJ Maxx and like my makeup on
this eye is completely gone from crying
from the wind like don't handle cold
very well we're at the Nike store now
and it's like a hundred degrees in here
but anyways I went to lush and I got
some goodies well I just got one I got a
tea tree oil like water thing like a
spray for my face which I've tried
before and I really liked but the second
we walked into lush it was really funny
Colin there is the first thing he said
he's like oh like like can I eat this
like he thought a hold of the soaps in
like the bath bombs were food I thought
that was so funny I wish I was vlogging
when it actually happened but yeah it
was just really funny it was like um no
it's soap but yeah they do look like
food now that I'm like thinking about it
and not knowing what it is it does kind
of look like food but I just thought
that was funny take your boyfriend into
lush and see if he like wants to eat the
food or eat the soap but I'm about to
get these leggings from Nike I really
like them they're like the legendary fit
I have leggings from here and they're my
absolute favorite but I wanted like the
longer ones because I have our the
capris but yeah they're great great
quality and I really really like them
and the legendary ones are actually the
cheapest Nike ones I've seen compared to
like the other ones that are like cool
they're like 150 these are I think are
like 9b which are still like ridiculous
wear leggings I know but I have them
forever so I don't know I guess I'm
justifying it but yeah let me know what
your favorite pair of like athletic
leggings are because I wear those every
single day in the winter so I would
really like to know so I don't
spend a lot of money on it and just not
only have like the two pairs
de Dieu
well I guess like the first official day
of being here and the last yeah but we
are about to go to the White House I see
the Washington Monument from where I'm
standing there it is in the back you
guys can see it Washington DC is like
the world's longest crosswalks like this
one's only 30 seconds but some of them
are like 60 seconds 75 seconds like
someone was like 120 seconds oh we
stopped my compass coffee
it's um they have multiple locations in
DC it's really really good pretty
expensive though
um but yeah so here we are I will show
you guys around it's cold but not as
cold as yesterday I don't think but yeah
let's go but they have this big fence in
front and last time I was here we were
like way closer I don't know what that
is it might be temporary because the
inauguration was last week I don't know
if it's temporary or they're building it
or they're tearing it down but yeah this
fence was not here before so I don't
know what this is hello you guys
so I was trying to get a picture in
front of that pretty house like the
Dwight Eisenhower house but I was just
office building but I was like messing
around my camera oh I like my DSLR just
like shooting pictures of it like The
Secret Service guy was definitely giving
me like a side eye he probably thought I
was like I don't know taking pictures to
plot my way in I don't know because I
looked at my dangerous there's the
Washington Monument I used to think that
was the Pentagon I'm really stupid but
know that
there's like secret service everywhere
there it is there's the White House be
are in Chinatown or entering it sure
about to eat we're going to eat lunch
with a sister at the piano some Italian
place in Chinatown that's really weird
the sculpture museum it's like an
outdoor sculpture thing I love this one
it's like the loved one in New York but
instead or in Philly I don't know where
it is
instead it's in Spanish Colin and I got
a couple pictures by there just cuz it's
cute it's like a good like couple
pictures spot I guess what this is but
some things of art I'm just like however
I feel like anyone could have done this
but as long as you're famous and you
just call it art it counts but a lot of
people that are very into art or like oh
my gosh no how dare you say that this is
like symbolizes so much more than just
like Jenga but it looks like Jenga it is
untitled very deep I mean seriously I'm
sorry I don't care how big of an artist
I look you are this is not art it's
literally a wall it is a wall it's can
you please explain to me what this is
it's just a brown wall I could have done
this instead of his art like I can't
look up and look at it it makes me dizzy
it looks like it's like falling yeah
looks like it's flowing in the wind
oh my gosh your hair is funny this is
hair we are walking all the way over
there
she's a Lincoln Memorial Oh chillin
right now Colin wanted to watch the end
of the UNC game and they're getting
destroyed us to UNC if any of you guys
were wondering it they're playing Miami
right now in basketball and they're
losing so so yeah we're just doing that
my phone is actually dying which just
sucks but oh well I think after the
Lincoln Memorial we might go to I don't
know where I want to go I kind of want
to get a Starbucks or something we
really really really love DC so I
actually someone snapchatted me saying I
should have a meetup here so if you guys
live here let me know so that next time
I come maybe I'll have a meet-up that
would be really really cool I've never
had a meetup before but
and how many of you guys live in North
Carolina and like if I did a meet-up in
North Carolina would anyone come I don't
know I feel like I'm not big enough to
do a meet-up but I don't know
so let me know hope you guys liked this
vlog - I have no idea how it's gonna
turn out but I feel like I've been
vlogging quite a bit I miss walking
after vlogmas I'm just like I need it
back so I think in the summer I might
daily vlog or try to maybe not daily
vlogging me like five times a week vlog
or something I don't know hopefully in
the summer you're here at the Lincoln
Memorial and the Washington Monument

we're glasses cuz it's pretty sunny my
eyes are watering so my makeup is kind
of gross already because it's super cold
