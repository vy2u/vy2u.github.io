kind of ride yeah that's the first thing
I got to do it in the morning so what
this class ends super early so what I do
is I come back from class and I just
make my breakfast and I eat breakfast
every morning
I cannot skip breakfast I don't know

piece of toast to heat up or and then
I'm gonna eat toast with butter so Oh
hot alright so in case you guys can't
tell um my room it's a total mess and I
need to clean that and I do that like
every day and then it's still just that
happened to any of you guys like serious
question do you guys clean your room

am at Lake Johnson and I'm about to go
for a run I think I'm going to take this
off because it's like 70 degrees outside
so it's like not even cold so I don't
need this long sleeve thing but yeah I
think I'm gonna go for southeast then
turn right
GPS I'm here Here I am at Lee Johnson
and I'm about to go for a run like I
said a million times so I was debating
on if I stick my camera or not because I
want to get some cool shots like at the
lake because it is beer s taking me
beautiful I think it's so so nice
especially cuz it's in like not a place
where you think it would be like I don't
know Raleigh's just not like oh there's
a really nice lake there um yeah it's so
nice and I think I'm gonna bring my
camera it's really small so like I can
run with it but I think I'm gonna have
to sacrifice the water bottle so I'm not
going to take my water bottle I can take
my camera and then I'm going to put my
phone like in my sports bra while I run
so I'm not like carrying a bunch of
things I don't think I'm going to do
what too much maybe just like two miles
or something like that just quick jog
yeah so let's go let's go for a run guys
even from my car it's so nice like look
at this so nice hey guys so I just
finished my run and I ran about two and
a half miles and then walked ones like
like film and take some pictures and
stuff for the vlog and just like for
myself but like it is so beautiful I
just I really really like this lake just
I can't get over how pretty this lake is
like it's just like about five minutes
away from my school and it's so nice
like I'm really happy that we have
something like this around me because it
motivates me to run outside because like
I will never run on a treadmill I hate
the treadmill
so I just got back from jubal a coffee
