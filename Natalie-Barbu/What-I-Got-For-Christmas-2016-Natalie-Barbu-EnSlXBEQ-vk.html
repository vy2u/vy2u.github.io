and today I am calling to you guys with
a video for what I got for Christmas so
I am so excited because I don't think
I've ever filmed this video maybe like
once or twice I found this video but I'm
right here sitting in for Nitra very
festive Christmas video style yeah I
actually open presents this morning
which when you guys are seeing it it
will be Christmas but so when I'm
filling this it is the actually the 21st
of December because my family goes to
Florida every year and we always go
during Christmas so we always open
presents either before or after
Christmas so yeah that's why we open
presents before so it actually works out
so I can have this video up on this one
even yeah I am NOT just pre filming and
like cheating and like randomly getting
people to give me things before
Christmas or whatever no our family
actually did the whole shebang like
Christmas presents from Santa and stuff
like that like that was today and I
actually blogged some of it to I'm doing
vlogmas so make sure that you guys are
subscribed so you can see that and also
I post videos every Tuesdays on
Thursdays not in December so in December
it's kind of like a weird schedule just
because it is vlogmas so i don't really
know how to post regular videos and
other videos but normally i do post
Tuesdays and Thursdays so be sure to
subscribe if you guys haven't already
and let's just get into this video
actually before I get started hold on I
just need to make a disclaimer I am NOT
saying any of this to brag so if any of
those are the comments down below I
don't really want comment flink oh my
gosh you guys have so much money or like
I hated what you got whatever the
comments are gonna be I just don't
really want like those types of comments
on the video I'm not doing any of this
Brad I'm not doing any of this to show
off either I'm very very fortunate and I
am well aware of that so yeah let's just
get into the video so the first thing I
got is this Erin Condren agenda so I
used this last year so I actually told
my sister to get me this because she
asked me when I
and this is what I wanted because I
don't wanna spend my own money on it so
this is my favorite they are the Erin
Condren agendas they are seriously the
best I personalized it with my name and
I like I have the one I just have the
whole year so it's only from January to
December and I have the one that is
vertical I think these are so pretty I
absolutely love the cover of mine and
also I don't know I just feel so many
weren't organized I've already had one
for a year and a half and I've never
felt more organized before so I'm really
happy about that
so yeah I just I'm obsessed with this
thank you so much to my sister who got
this from me and love the cover love my
name just everything about this I'm
cannot wait for the new year so I can
start using this like I'm already
actually gonna start planning out like
the new year on this and like writing
all my days off and everything like that
yeah I'm so excited so this is honestly
one of my favorite gifts that I got the
next thing that I got is from my mom and
she actually got me a 10-day I believe
10 class pass from a hot yoga studio
where I go to school so I'm actually
really excited for that because I've
been getting into hot yoga and just like
stretching more I do it for the workout
not really like the practice of it but I
do it because I think it's a great
workout so yeah I'm excited because this
place is like just hot yoga and that is
mainly what I like to do and if you guys
want a fitness routine let me know
because I've been getting way more
intimate I don't really do that much
like crazy stuff but yeah if you guys
want to see that then let me know in the
comments below the next thing that I got
is this hat I think it is so cute I
believe it is from my sister it's like
velvet and blue and just so so cute I'm
obsessed I would put it on but my hair
is like this so I don't really want to
mess it up I wear baseball caps if you
guys can't tell in my vlog but I
basically wear a baseball cap every
single video I wear them all the time so
I'm really happy to add that one to the
collection it's a little more like high
fashion but still really cute and really
a little brother gothis for me it is a
josie maran it is the Argan whipped
argan oil these are my favorite lotions
ever anything knows that and so he got
me like this sampler of them I guess and
it is all of the sense of the josie
maran argan oil i you guys do not if
years I've never tried these highly
highly recommend them as they are the
best they smell so good and they are so
moisturizing so basically one of these
is probably the size of like one full
one or one and a half full ones but I
get to try out all the scents I'm
obsessed and I love it so much the next
thing I got from my parents is this
purse from a Nordstrom so it is like
this suede satchel purse but I actually
am going to exchange it because I have a
lot of purses that are like this like
very like frumpy and like no structure
and I really want to get a structured
purse so my mom was like if you don't
like it please exchange it like we don't
wanna get you something that you won't
really rare so I'm actually gonna go and
exchange it I really love this one I
just like really want a structured bag
so yeah the next thing I got is this
women's Carolina a tip gloves these are
also for my parents so these are awesome
because they're North Face and they keep
you super warm because I live in North
Carolina and I don't know just walking
into class and the cold it's miserable
so I'm glad that I got so I'm like
heavy-duty gloves and also they aren't
eat tip gloves which means that I can
use my iPhone with them so that is so
exciting because I'm one of those people
that will not put on gloves because I
want to use my phone so this is great
because they're super thick and gray of
course because I love black and gray and
they're gonna keep you warm and I can
use my phone next thing I got are these
shoes and they are from a Nike I'm just
show I was so confused when I opened
them but like I really really love them
so they are their new training shoes so
they don't have laces and they I don't
have any like neon colors like these so
yeah these are them
they are so so cool yeah they just have
like that one strap and the neck is fine
so these are super super cool and then
the next thing that I got are these
boots and these are also again for cold
weather you guys probably think I live
in like Antarctica from all these like
cold other things I'm getting I don't I
live in Raleigh well Charlotte and then
I go to school in Raleigh so it's not
like it's super super cold compared to
some of you guys I actually asked you
guys what the temperature was on one of
my blogs and you guys were like oh it's
like negative 25 degrees here I'm like
well it's like 40 here and I am
shivering and dying so yeah I can't
complain too much but these are from
Sperry I believe yeah these are Sperrys
and I love them because they're like
rain proof or waterproof down here I'm
like the soles and stuff and then
they're leather at the top which is so
cool and they have fur and just like
combat style I love these
one more thing it's my favorite of all
time so hold on it's upstairs because I
used it can you guess what it is so my
favorite gift that I got actually it is
for my little sister Chloe she got me
the Kylie holiday kit so this is not the
biggest one that Kylie has what I think
it is one of the biggest one it comes
with so much stuff like I'm so it comes
with six of her mini matte lipsticks
which is where I'm wearing right now I
honestly thought that my matte lipstick
that I have on was gonna be like a light
purple and end up turning like kind of
like vampire purple but I really like it
I'm not like afraid of dark lipstick or
anything like that and like I don't have
like bold eyes right now so that's cute
I'll be definitely doing making books
with these really excited it comes with
the kaya shadow so the holiday edition
one I love the packaging of all of
Kylie's products I think it is so so
cute I'm such a sucker for like all the
Kylie products this is what the front
looks like so cute and then it actually
has a mirror which is great because I
remember like the first ones didn't have
mirrors and then these are the
shadows I love these colors I don't
really have a lot of these colors I know
I got these shadows they are so so cute
and I don't have any of these colors so
I'm really excited and they're super
super pigmented so I will be doing a
makeup tutorial with these if you guys
want to see them I think I'm gonna get
any more into makeup also this holiday
season then I got a lipstick or no not a
lipstick it's a gloss it's a holiday
edition gloss in this like cute package
and it is this like the rights bright
red which I never wear reds so I'm like
really really except then it comes with
another gloss but this one is actually
red and sparkly it is so beautiful you
guys like oh my goodness I am a cest
with it so it definitely will be doing
some makeup looks with this like version
also comes with a liquid lipstick like a
full one and a lip liner like her famous
like what she came out with so this is
the holiday edition one it's another red
one and I don't have any red so that is
why that it's great I love it so so much
five are my favorite gifts of all time
then it also comes with a cream shadow
so this is the yellow gold cream shadow
honestly not that impressed with this
one I'm not gonna lie everything else
very impressed with but I'm not that
impressed with the cream shadow it is
just this yellow and I don't know I like
it but like again the other things are
way cooler so that is all that comes
with that so I think you guys so much
for watching again I did not do this to
brag but if you guys want to say what
you guys got for Christmas down below
