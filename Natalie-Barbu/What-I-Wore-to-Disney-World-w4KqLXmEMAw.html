just filming a quick intro for you guys
so i'm just chillin on my floor right
now make just making an intro i recently
went to disney world this week it's in
orlando florida if you guys have never
been if you guys haven't been i highly
recommend going um but yeah so I just
filmed outfits there and I didn't vlog
but I just kind of films what I was
wearing and then I did a makeup tutorial
for one of the days so I figured you
guys could use this makeup for an
amusement park or just day out or just
everyday occasion I don't really know um
but yeah so I'm just gonna show you guys
what I wore and I went to magic kingdom
the first day and then I went to
Hollywood studios and epcot the second
day and I went to universal and islands
of adventure the third day which is not
part of disney but i did not feel my
outfit to their just because it was
really hot and really crowded and I just
didn't feel like filming that day I was
exhausted so I filmed two of my Disney
outfits let me know what you guys think
of them let me know which one is your
favorite outfit one of the outfits you
guys have seen before but that's okay
and also I'd kind of wanted to make a
quick announcement for you guys I am I
started a fashion blog and I used to
have one and it's still linked down
below it's called um fashion by nat XO
on tumblr and i just wanted to do a more
like legit blog this time so i started a
new one and it's actually called young
wild &amp;amp; free people so that's what the
blog is called and i thought that was
kind of clever just because i am
obsessed with free people for those of
you guys who don't know that so and i do
have a lot of free people pieces but
mostly my clothes are kind of like my
outfits are just inspired by free people
because three people is very expensive
so i don't have that many free people
pieces but anyways it would mean so so
much to me if you guys checked it out so
yeah that'd be cool anyways i'm just
gonna get right into this video and let
me know which is your favorite and i
hope you guys all have a great summer
bye
to start off my makeup I just started
with a BB cream I used L'Oreal's youth
code BB cream I just like this one just
because it's very lightweight and it
does have a little bit of coverage so
yeah I pretty much use that every day
and then I just set it with a powder
just so my face doesn't get too oily
this video my face looks very oily but
the powder kind of sets in and
throughout the day my face was not that
oily guys so sorry about that in the
video next I used a hula benefit bronzer
and I just put that all over my face
just so that I look a little bit more
bronze throughout the day and just so it
kind of matches my body and then i used
the NARS multiple in the color orgasm
and this is just a really pretty pinkish
gold color so I just put that on my
cheeks and then I blended it in then i
primed my eyes because it is very hot in
Florida so I did not want my eyelids
chill sweaty and then my makeup to fall
off so then I just put um some champagne
color eyeshadow on my lid from the
two-faced palette that I own and I just
put that all over my lid as a base color
then I also put that in my highlight
just to kind of make my eyebrows pop a
little bit then I put this jarden color
into my crease it's a peachy color I
just kind of wanted it to be more
summery so I put that into my crease and
sorry about like my siblings and my
family walking in the background if you
guys can see them I was just kind of
filming in the living room then I put an
orange color on my lid and I don't
really I can't really read what it says
and then I just put my Kat Von D liquid
eyeliner on my upper lash line just to
line my eyes
electric blue Urban Decay 24-7 glide on
eye pencil underneath my eyes this just
gave it a pop of color because I feel at
an amusement park you kind of want to
have a little bit fun with your eye
shadow then I just curled my lashes and
apply in my favorite mascara
I also added lip balm just to make my
lips and not chapped at all and then i'm
done with the makeup and now entering
hollywood studios for the outfit
so this was formerly known as MGM but
anyways I'm wearing a crop top with
shorts and just some vans and you guys
have seen this outfit before if you guys
have watched my crews outfit of the week
I actually wore the shorts and the shirt
ad on my cruise and then I just gave you
a quick look at my makeup and so the
shirt is from American Eagle it's just a
striped crop top and then my shorts are
from american eagle as well and my shoes
are vans so the same day we went to
Epcot we got the park hopper and I'm
weighing the same thing and as you can
see it's raining and this outfit I my
hair went through either ponytail or
just straight so I also straighten my
hair to stay it was really cool because
the world cup is on so the Disney had
little world cup set up anyways I love
this outfit just because it keeps you
cool and it's cute and it doesn't really
show that much of your stomach but it
does show a little bit and I like crop
tops if crops up start your thing that's
cool too though then my magic kingdom
day outfit um as you can tell I was
pretty excited and I just love magicking
them I think it's so so pretty and it
just looks like you're in another world
i absolutely love disney world anyways
i'm wearing h muscle tank from urban
outfitters and it's just an american
flag one and then I'm wearing
high-waisted shorts but you can't tell
they're high-waisted from Hollister and
my white high top converse
so that was my outfit for magic kingdom
and for Hollywood studios and epcot I
hope you guys like Sam and my ear with
you multiple stages this trip I just
kind of did whatever and so yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this video please

you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
