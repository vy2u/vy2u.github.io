coming to you with a video about what
it's really like to be a youtuber so
this is a really fun video to film into
brainstorm for but basically I don't
even know what my life would be like if
I didn't do YouTube videos and I feel
like I never realized how it impacts
basically all aspects of my life the
first way that affects my is listening
to music I'm constantly looking for
music to put in the background of my
video get any song I hear it has a
potential to make it in a video what's
on in the background did you can use
this for a video the next way that I
always impacts my life is basically I'm
always looking for a tech equipment
which can get very very expensive so
that is definitely something I wish that
wasn't kind of like infiltrated into my
life okay so I know basically everything
I want costs about two thousand dollars
but I mean I really do need it to make a
youtube video and I guess I mean I'll
use them all the time stuff like I don't
think he'll mind he's my boyfriend right
like he's supposed to give me things
that I love and I mean that's only thing
that I love I guess I can just start
saving money in them buy it on my own
the next thing is kind of funny and but
is whenever I'm flying makeup so like
I'm getting ready to go out and get any
good day I kind of always in the back my
head like put it on like I'm making a
YouTube video on it when I'm really by
myself in my room like just in front of
meters so today I'm going to start off
with my favorite concealer wait
and then when it comes to clothes as
guys know I do a lot of look books and
fashion halls and everything like that
but basically when I try on clothes in
the morning it looks a little bits like
Barry all that she can take care to
leave a trace hola we got everything has
the potential to be a lookbook so yeah
if you're ever shopping with me and I am
in addressing your like you better
believe that in my head I'm thinking
about how this would be a very great
lookbook next one is definitely my
favorite part of a new youtuber but is
that I am never lonely so you guys are
with me on all my vacations whenever I'm
bored I can always just pull out my
camera and talk to you and I know people
are like Natalie it's a camera you are
lonely but really i'm not i don't know
whenever I talk to the camera I really
feel like i'm talking like to face to
face to someone update nothing's really
happened but we still the beach and i
just want to vlog so yeah miss you guys
i am back in my bedroom and i'm just
laying in bed I'm about to start editing
always accompanying me on all my trips
because it makes them way way more fun
my next one is another favorite of mine
that it has definitely impacted my life
but I am able to vent and I'm a person
dies very closed off but I love getting
things off my chest so it kind of
doesn't work out it's like how can you
be closed off but then not tell people
things but then want to get it off your
chest so that is why youtube videos are
perfect so it's kind of like my outlet
of venting things that I can't really
tell my friends I tell you guys and just
honestly like yours are my friends so
when I event to my friends I like
venting to you guys too it's just like
blows my mind that girls like my little
sister's a true freshman in high school
they are 14 years old they are like who
like worrying about their bodies the
worst feeling I have honestly ever felt
and I that if I'm making videos so that
I feel that you guys don't go through it
at a didn't do just know that like it's
gonna be okay basically my goal in life
is to help other girls that's basically
what I want to do and that's why I want
to help you guys through YouTube videos
and lastly the way that it is in fact of
my life is that YouTube has made me way
more confident and I don't know I've
just grown so much from my very first
video to now fun and being able to look
back at that and I really have to thank
you tube and you guys for all my
confidence and for the opportunities
that has granted me and just finding
something that I love I was never into
sports or it I didn't have very many
hobbies when I was younger Thank You
Tube for making providing a passion like
that I have because I never had one and
now I do and just seeing myself that and
now and wanting to tell my 16 year old
cells like keep doing what you're doing
this is amazing like you are going to
get through whatever you're going
through you are going to see the light
at the end of the tunnel and you are
going to find that you love and yeah
that's suddenly the best part about
being late to work so i hope that guys
enjoyed this video let me know if you
know I was
me or if you thought that it was cool or
if you related to it oh let me know in
the comments below everything that you
guys think give this video a thumbs up
