I'm about to go to the mall with my
little sister right now and we're about
to buy some Christmas presents cuz we go
to Florida every Christmas and we can't
bring all of the presents there so we
always open them either before Christmas
or after Christmas so it's not it's fun
but whatever I'd rather go to Florida
anyways so yeah we're opening Christmas
presents before this year so I have
about five days to get all the Christmas
presents and I haven't bought any so
today I'm trying to knock it out and
Chloe told me what she wants so I don't
care if she's there while I get it for
her because it'll just be easier
honestly I'm excited to get like a nice
cup of coffee like I just kind of walk
up with coffee right now you know when
you're in those moons yeah that's my
mood right now I'm with Chloe right now
we are going to the mall to shop for
Christmas presents like I said and Chloe
bought I think everyone's right I just
have Lucas's lap but I have to order
that online so we're not gonna save a
Chloe got because maybe her boyfriend
will watch my videos Patrick you're
watching or hanging anyone from Chloe's
school if you're watching feel like a
lot of people from the where I went to
high school watch my videos just cuz I

degrees it feels a lot colder honestly

actually just get a vegetable bowl
I don't know I don't really like meat
into my I'm not a vegetarian but I don't
like meat in my burrito bowls I think
it's like overpowers it so I get
vegetables and go walk and this just
looks so pretty it just looks like the
rainbow it's like actually crazy at the

kind of like how it turned out I kind of
like how all my vlogs turn out for the
most part because I don't really like

hate any of my videos besides the old
cringy ones which I kinda want to do
