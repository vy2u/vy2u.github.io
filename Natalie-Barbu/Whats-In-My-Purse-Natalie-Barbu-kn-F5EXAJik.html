I'm coming to you guys with a very
exciting video so I am filming a what's
in my purse video and the reason I think
this is exciting is because I don't know
if you guys have been around YouTube for
too long but these videos were the most
popular things like five years ago
so I actually saw a lot of people
started doing them like one of my best
friends Steph she made one so you guys
can check her out also a lot of other
people started making what's in my bag
video so I was like you know what I'm
going to hop on board if you are new to
my channel please be sure to subscribe I
would love it if you guys would
subscribe and join the family so I chose
videos every Tuesday and Friday and my
subscribers are the absolute best so
yeah if you guys want to join like
definitely do it because it's not do you
think you're missing out alright so this
is my bag I'm obsessed with it so this
is a Teddy blake bag this is a very new
designer and so it's kind of like an
up-and-coming designer but it is a legit
designer handbag so I'm really excited
because I have been looking for a
structured handbag for so so so long and
all the ones that I'm like obsessed with
they're like $2,000 so no like so
anyways these are also a not cheap
either but they're not as expensive as
like Gucci Louis Vuitton so now all of
those like nowhere near and this is the
most expensive one because I stayed get
the biggest one just because you'll see
everything I have in here I just need in
a big bag so yeah this is my bad I love
love love it it did not come with this
puff I put it on this is from I don't
even remember where this is from
I think Topshop I think I got it in New
York in Topshop yeah and I love the
color of the bag it's very you're able
to wear it in any season it matches
anything and I have a lot of black bag
so that's why I didn't want to get a
black one because like I have so many I
need to get my own yeah I wanted to
structured bags is all I have is like
flashy like boho II bags and I just
wanted one that was like a box and like
structured and also I really like this
because it has those things on the
bottom so it just fits so it doesn't
like
you don't have to worry about it getting
dirty or anything like that switches
fist also this leather is made in Italy
so it is all legit whether it's very
very very like smell with a new bag when
I got it and it was just just beautiful
I absolutely loved it yeah so I'm
obsessed with design but enough about
the outside of it it's so Q and it's
really really big look I got the 14 inch
bag this is the Katie 14 inch bag so I
will have everything linked down below
yeah I'm upset you guys wanna get this
bag check it out down below so this is
how you open the bag that is one thing
that is a little complicated about it it
does take a little bit to open but I
still think it's really cute you
actually have to undo this part so then
these will come off of that so then that
comes off and see and then you can undo
it like that and then this part is not
actually about it's like you take it off
and you put it on with that so it goes
from the top which isn't opening on the
top then that comes off and then again
like that so that's why it does take a
little bit to open the bag but it's very
secure which I like but now moving on to
it is in the bag also disclaimer that I
do not always have all of this in the
bag this is for when my dad is like
maxed out when I need to take everything
that I might possibly need in my life
and I will put it in the sack so that is
what this is this is not like I carry
this around every single day in my life
so the first thing I have in my bag is
probably my wallet this is a Marc Jacobs
wallet I've had this since like
sophomore year of high school or
something like that I've had it forever
I absolutely love this wallet the
leather is so so soft and I like the
Marc Jacobs like logo right here I had
it for so long though that it is getting
dirty I don't know if you guys can see
but it has like dirt right here and like
a little bit along the top but it's
still an awesome condition for accessory
for having it for so long
the next thing that I have in my purse
is my car keys I always use my purse and
I actually have a push to start car so
it's really nice I never ever have to
get my keys out of my purse so that's
like I would bother me that it takes
like a minute to undo this person and
then I
have a cute riddle of monograms keychain
this is from when I was in my sorority
my bag gave this to me really really
like it's like beige marble the next
thing that in has in my bag are two
pairs of sunglasses so the first kind
are these Ray Bans and I also had these
since like freshman year of high school
something crazy I really want to get
some new ones though just because I want
the ones that have like a mirror on them
the ones that are reflective but yeah
these are my ray-bans that I have had
just like for ever these are my classic
go-to sunglasses and then my next pair
sunglasses
I got at a local boutique and these are
just like sunglasses that sometimes I
like putting on I like them because they
have like the rose-colored you can see
like the light I know it looks really
weird I just like the color of them and
then I like how their features you can
like see my eyes they're just like very
very trendy and yeah good like photo
like the next thing that I have in my
bag is just like beauty products I guess
I don't carry a lot of make up with me
because I barely ever touch my makeup up
during the day but I have a perfume this
would be Daisy by Marc Jacobs perfume it
is my absolute favorite perfume since
forever yeah so I have this just in case
just in case I want to freshen up during
the day and like smell good I also have
my favorite lips like liquid lipstick in
here this is the Kat Von D liquid
lipstick and I have this in here because
if I don't have anything on my lips this
is just my go-to it is the absolute best
liquid lipstick ever and then I have two
chopsticks in here I don't know why I
have two but I have one that just like
squeezes out and then one that's just a
sick because your girl needs chapstick I
actually have two pairs of headphones in
here so the first pair I have are just
these classic headphones the only thing
is I have the iPhone 7 so I can't use
these anymore
so I can't use these because they have
like the headphone jack but I always
always always forget to bring headphones
whenever I'm editing my videos so that's
why I have these because this so goes
into my laptop so I just bring these
because it's just like I'd rather have
headphones for my laptop than for my
phone because I don't already listen to
music that much like on my phone if I'm
on the go I don't know how so that's why
these are more important
the next pair of headphones that I have
are these I absolutely love these
headphones so this is it I won't let me
put these in here if I'm like going to
edit videos like going to do something
on my computer that requires headphones
I guess if I want like better headphones
but the other ones in there because
sometimes these die and these die pretty
quickly actually yeah I love these these
are bluetooth and they are really cute
they're like totally soundproof like I
can barely hear myself they're just
amazing these are the parrots Zika
headphones I think Zika is that it I
felt like the Zika virus um I think this
is but I don't know the next thing that
I had in my purse is a Hershey bar
honestly don't know why I have this
I like having any random snap in my
purse because sometimes I get very angry
and I get really upset even though
having like food so I just I guess this
is the only snack I had found when I was
putting my hurts like contents and yeah
I have a Hershey bar this is definitely
all the healthiest don't recommend
having Hershey bars in your bag all the
time but I do recommend having a snack
because sometimes you get hungry and you
can't eat and finding food in your purse
is like finding 20 bucks in your cart
next thing that I have again this is
only for special occasions so I have my
iPad this is a giant iPad you got
assistance be twelve point nine inch
which is the sole reason why I got the
14 inch bag because this was the only
one that would fit my iPad so this is a
huge iPad you guys can see um it's
amazing I absolutely love it I've never
made a better purchase in my life I
think I'm going to do a video on how I
take notes because the reason why I got
this was for school so sometimes I'll
have this just if I need to do homework
on the go or if I just want to take it
because I watch like Netflix on here and
I watching YouTube videos like this is
like has replaced my laptop in almost
every way besides editing videos I
always use my iPad now so yeah this is
just a great like slim way to kind of
have a computer with me at all times so
yeah if you I'm actually going to film a
video on how I take notes at school and
it will be using this baby so I love it
and then
thing that I have is this gorilla tripod
thing is compromised like a knockoff
brand this was like ten dollars but yes
one of these tripods and I just got this
and this is because I'm going to DC this
weekend and I realized I needed
something better to blog and I'm also
going to New York Fashion Week so I just
wanted something to blog so I'm going to
be like holding this around kind of a -
selfie stick and vlogging with it I'm
going to show you guys the inside now so
that was all just like thrown in here in
the middle and then there's two zippers
on the side or one zipper and then one
like pocket that's really big so I'm
going to go through one of the pockets
now one pocket I just have the blogging
camera so I have me canon g7x mark - in
case anyone was wondering I absolutely
love it yes I keep this in a pocket
because I don't want it to get scratched
or anything or damaged so yes try to
keep my vlogging camera with me as much
as possible in the next pocket again I
don't keep this with me at all times but
a lot more in the winter I have this
baby which a lot of you guys are
probably like what the heck is that this
supercool thing is an electronic hand
warmer so it's really great because I
hate the cold and I got this for
Christmas and then the other stuff that
I have in that pocket which is the last
step I have a baggie of ibuprofen
because I get headaches or cramp and I
just always want to keep these with me
because I don't know in case I need them
and then I have like tampons and pads in
the other parts because getting your
period unexpectedly and not having
something is the worst so yeah all girls
make sure to keep like a pocket of pads
and tampons in your first it's just it's
going to save you from a lot of trouble
so that is my bag again I can only say

love it so please check out penny break
