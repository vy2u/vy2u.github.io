a what's in my bag video I know this is
requested to all beauty gurus and I just
decided it's time that I do one so let's
get started I have this Coach bag as my
bag it's super cute
it's one of these drawstring bags it has
a cute little zipper right here and it's
just plain on this side I got this at
Bloomingdale's in New York if any of you
guys were wondering it was on sale I'm
not sure exactly what the exact model is
called I'll link in the bottom bar look
below if I if they still sell it I don't
know but I got it in April so I sure
they do but again it was on sale so I'm
not really sure how long they're gonna
plan to keep it but anyways let's just
get started with the what's in my back
part of this shoot of this video first
I'm going to start with my wallets this
is our u wallet from Urban Outfitters I
bought this last year he's probably the
cutest wallet I've ever seen in my life
just looks like this has lace and it's
like metallic behind the lace it's
really really cute it opens up like this
it has a lot of different compartments
in this compartment the first one I just
have money and then over here in this
other one I just have like Delia's
rewards card
I have Sephora skincare challenge again
I think all these rewards cards they
don't do any more and then I just have
like a YMCA pass card and then over here
I have pretty much all my coupons I got
this from Starbucks ten free songs and
then I have just like coupons from
toothpaste I have coupons from
restaurants just a bunch of coupons and
then over here I have my ID I only have
my permit since I'm 15 but here I'll
cover up my address looks like this it's
cute I guess
not really I really like my picture but
it's okay nobody really has a good ID
picture and then over here I just have
all my cards I have a Starbucks card I
have a gift card I just
to have that type of stuff I want to
have my Sephora beauty insider card in
there another thing I have in my purse
is this Kate Spade case I am sunglass
case it's really cute I love these
sunglasses they look like this they're
cat eye tight you can see me I gotta
look like Jenna from very low wires and
them I think
but the glasses she wears so you can see
the computer screen I mean I like them a
lot I got them for my birthday oh and
their case buy it I don't know if I
mentioned it and then I have advil in my
purse because if I ever get like a
random headache or a month ago and
someone's stomach hurt today I don't
know it's just something hurts I'll just
give them water I'll take one then I
have this cute little lip balm
it's a OS um looks like this it's really
cute and I just put on your lips I'm not
gonna put it on now because I actually
just did a tutorial and I have lip gloss
on so I don't really feel like doing
that we're putting this on right now
another thing I have in my purse is this
iPod Touch it's just it's not a new one
it doesn't have a camera or anything but
it's just a plain iPod Touch looks like
this if I ever need a listen to music or
anything I don't have headphones I'm
here which I'm kind of akin to you put I
just recently took them out but normally
I would have headphones in here so
that's also gonna be part of my what's
in my bag but I also have I bought this
at a Nordstrom for free somebody gave it
to me this is philosophy um hope springs
eternal it's deep sea ultrafine
hydrating mist jewelry nice um if you
ever get dry or anything you just spritz
this on your face and it just really
refreshes you expecially in a hot day
and it doesn't take off your makeup
doesn't take off your eyeliner your
eyeshadow your mascara or anything it's
just really really pretty I mean it's
not really pretty I don't know why I
said that it's really refreshing is what
it is so scratch that and then I have
this bareMinerals you just squeeze it
open and then powder comes out so put
this on my face real fast it's nice it's
a mineral veil that I have in here in
case I ever get oily um
use this in a while so I may need to
refill it just nice and in case you get
oily or something you don't want to have
like the mineral veal and then the
actual thing and then just like put it
all on your face you know you just want
to have that then I have my camera case
and it has a running camera inside of it
I have a coolpix Nikon I'm not sure what
model so OPEX s210 this I don't even
know I haven't used this in like a few
months actually I think it's broken
because it doesn't turn on but I just
mean it just may be dead but I don't
really know I think I'm gonna need a
charge it because I haven't I don't know
where the charger is I just keep this in
my purse just in case that ever decides
to come back to life and they sell these
I know in Henry Bendel's they sell these
in from Tesco stores they sell these all
over annual Kiki stores it's a mini
emergency kit is the cutest thing ever
I thought this one at Henri Bendel but
it literally have like your all your
needs in it it has hairspray many
hairspray cubes it has clear nail polish
as liquid breath mint I really like this
actually it tastes really good I have it
has pins and needles and buttons and
threads and everything this is a mini
nail file a tampon
it has nail polish remover a deodorant
towel and I think oh wait there's more
it has a stain remember I think he has a
band-aid yep this is a band-aid in here
I think yeah you should get stuck in
and then Oh has double-sided tape that's
it and I also had advil but I already
took it I also have this Clinique lip
saw lipstick lipstick it's just like a
really pretty natural looking color it's
really really nice on it get to the lips
like a deeper color I got this for free
at Nordstrom as well it's in the color
bamboo pink Sephora mirror you just open
it up and it's a mirror I have a scale
Portofino you did toilet I completely
butchered that I bet it's in French
dee orb it's a perfume it's a little
sample I haven't even stopped this line
let's see oh my gosh it smells amazing
I have any black amethyst lotion in my
bath and Bodyworks I really like the way
this smells I don't know if they still
sell it I found in my closet and decided
to put it in my purse another one that I
have is antibacterial moisturizing hand
lotion by Bath and Body Works and
nectarine mint this is probably the
greatest lotion ever I'm just gonna put
it on have this Victoria's Secret it's a
lip plumper I got this also a while ago
I feel like I got everything a while ago
great and now my hands are really
slippery from the lotion it looks like
this you just pump it and then you see
it comes out just it's like the
brightest pink I didn't know they were
different like colors I just got the one
off the shelf because it was like by the
cashier you're like oh that's so cute
let me just by a while I'm paying for
bunch of other stuff and like and then I
also got this in New York when I went to
Bloomingdale's um it's a sample it's
Dior Addict it has these little lip
colors in it and then it comes with a
brush
these are Clark colors are so good and
we got like five samples because we kept
walking back before it's not on purpose
just because like it so happened to be
that way and I've already used like two
of them and I haven't opened this one
yet this Burt's Bees pink blossom tinted
lip balm the color it's the color it's
really pretty um it's
the tinted lip-balm goes a long way like
it's really color pigmented Burt's Bees
I love Burt's Bees and success with them
another one then I have a Mac lip
glosses and like probably my favorite
dazzle glass lip gloss of theirs it's
bare necessity it's a really pretty
shimmery type coral if you can see and
then I also normally keep my phone in my
purse I have an iPhone 4 um I don't know
where it is which might be a problem I
think it sounds stairs but I just have
my phone in there and that's all I have
in my purse which it's been a 12-minute
video and it seems like a lot but it's
really like not heavy this purse is so
cute I love it it's my favorite purse
and it's so like summer / spring I feel
like drawstrings are very in and it like
comes out and it's really pretty blue
inside it's so pretty and has like chain
and then it has a shorter one and it's
really good for traveling because it's
not a huge bag and be like oh my gosh is
so heavy so big it's such a hassle but
it's big enough to store everything you
pretty much made obviously if you want
to pack clothes in your travel bag this
won't pick clothes or shoes or anything
but it's good for like magazines I'm
bringing I'm actually traveling and
going to the airport today in about an
hour
um I'm just gonna put a bunch of
magazines a bunch of books all my crap
in here and then I'm good to go and you
