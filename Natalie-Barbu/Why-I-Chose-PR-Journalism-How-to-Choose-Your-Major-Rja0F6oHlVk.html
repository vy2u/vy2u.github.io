hi my name is Grace Lee I graduated from
UNC Chapel Hill and this is the one I
think this is all I um this is Natalie
it has a youtube again
she's from stay I'm from Chapel Hill
we're always hanging out together you
might have seen in so many blogs blog
I'm the one on the care on the on the
phone all the trays on the phone I just
graduated in May with a PR journalism
specialization at the j-school cmj
school actually at Carolina and well
finale asked me to talk about my major I
was like writing a really yes but it's
okay um so I'm going to share largest
role of them just like what it is
because these videos are supposed to
help you guys make your decision and
what you guys think you should major and
because I know college is so hard to
like where to go to school
what's major in what do I do do I go to
college whatever all that college is
just like a terrifying process so I'm
going to trying to make it a little less
scary for you guys and I'm gonna see any
of my other videos I'll have them all
linked down below I've done a couple
already in the series so you guys can
catch up but I am gonna have my
handy-dandy notebook and talk to her
about journalism and PRS so her to
specifically PR but she's in the journal
journalism school so we're kind of gonna
mix the two together and come to a show
some questions you guys know the drill
already handsome before so if you guys
are new here and you just need to
subscribe
you need you guys are new here and you
guys want to subscribe please hit the
button down below that would mean so
much to me if you guys just like any of
these colors videos or anything else
give this video a thumbs up and leave a
comment to make sure that you guys want
me to talk about next or just anything
college related that you guys want me to
talk about next because I would love to
do it and I need some more ideas so now
let's just go started in the video the
question I will be asking great is what
or what is journalism what if PR like
what that is it is so when people need
journalism they automatically think like
newspapers and like prints and magazines
and it's like not so much the digital
part but um a little do they know is
that journalism can apply to the online
portions like the blogs the what is it
like social media just basically
anything like articles and you know
people who go to Twitter to read like
the time articles in the mornings and
just like your morning news and that's
something I just want to emphasize it's
just not just like publications and just
like on print and you're not in class
writing newspapers every or articles
from newspapers every day
I chose public relations which is a
track within the j-school I need a
something Jake school it's the NJ school
we've changed we have a weight wide line
up MJ so it used to be school of media
and used to be Jo MC the journalism
school of mass communications but now
it's UNC media and journalism
so it's NJ school and the media there's
so many tracks within the school there's
like broadcasting advertising public
relations sports marketing there's a
heat and even business journalism which
is the another one and what is PR so PR
stands for public relations and it is
basically the relationship between the
organization and the public's like if
you want a definition version of that
and it's basically building a
relationship a you know form of
communication from one to the other
that's what it is all about building
relationships why did you choose
journalism's order to get into the MJ
school you have to basically go first
apply but you also have to choose the
specialization that you want go
consistently open closes that's why you
chances for people who don't get a girl
in it okay anyways I knew I want to do
journalism
we're coming to Carolina but the reason
why shows PR within jinx MJ school was
because I've always liked as a blogger
you know I've actually started my blog
seven years ago yeah she's a blogger
meant why did we met him that in the
beginning I think we didn't agree dude
did we I don't know she's a blogger by
the right so check out her blog I'll
have it linked down below
she's a fashion blog and she's like very
successful and has an awesome blog so
yeah
follow her down below ball around
instagrams alright cuz you know so I'm a
commercial product business okay watch
isn't is because back to the whole
definition of building relationships
I've just really enjoyed as a blogger
building relationships with my audience
and I've lost communicating whether it's
on social media or whether it's you know
in person I just really like helping
people my way of helping you know
compared to like a doctor helping people
saving lives it's like different but I
wanted to help people through you know
whether it's through fashion advice some
form of communication and that's why I
chose PR I really feel like I'm like at
an interview or a talk show because I'm
just like okay like next question do you
regret choosing PR or journalism I
thought as a yes and a no yes why I
regretted is because so I interned at
Rebecca Minkoff as a social media intern
and Lili Suzuki I was also her public
relations and marketing sales intern and
from those experiences I realized I
didn't like PR because PR is like me
writing press releases media kits and
always pinching and for me I really
think taking those classes made me
realize oh you know that's not what I
want to do but as a blogger I realized
that is what I'm supposed to do like
it's pure this major has taught me so
much for my blog and because of that I'm
so grateful
like I know how to write media kit
because of PR and I think
regret why it just comes from you know
doing what I love and it just wasn't
hitting it like it wasn't what I really
wanted to do but it's taught me a lot
so what I did oh you rather have died
now looking back looking back
Donna Carolina I know I joke around just
because UNC Chapel Hill doesn't have a
design or doesn't have a fashion major
just like it so yeah like my college is
NC State had a whole like fashion
textile school you know what I wouldn't
have it any other way I would have done
it the same and I learned a lot right
I've learned a lot and I've met so many
incredible people through PR yeah and
she's a graduate guy she's a college
grad she graduated this year house owner
she is like on her way like never coming
back to a human scene just says did you
like his helmet you can see we're going
a little off the interview here we're
going to assess I'm reminiscing on the
past it was an amazing four years what
are the type of jobs that you can get
with PR and with journalism a lot of
jobs honestly um it does not have to be
a like a news organization doesn't be
like Time Magazine's honestly PR every
company needs like a PR coordinator just
because if you're a company trying to
promote your brand you need someone to
pitch to other brands you need someone
to share it on social media that is all
a part of like the whole journalism PR
experience nowadays everything's on
social media you need a coordinator for
that you know whether it's like a shoe
company or even let's be like not even
in fashion what about like a curtain or
lamp yeah anything right on occurring my
dad my job builds houses that's what you
need an Instagram like you need one to
like show off yourself Instagram now I
feel like it's just a portfolio like it
really is I would never I don't know
about you guys and I accept this before
in a video but I would rather if I saw
like my favorite bloggers wearing a
dress or if I saw
a blogger wearing some sunglasses are
like going to a restaurant or something
and tagging it I would way trust her
word over if I saw like a magazine print
a magazine advertisement was like a
famous model that was photoshopped and
whatever you know like I have so much
other trusted loggers I'm like a
magazine advertisement and I feel it a
lot of lower the same way which is why
influencers are so like in demand I feel
like now because that's the new way that
people are going to be reached the ploy
is so important and it's not just you
know social media it's honestly there's
still journal is like our commencement
speaker was a CNN anchor Brooke you paid
attendance I heard it you thought she
was amazing she's estancia but she came
back to speak with us and she graduated
from Chatham Oh ten years ago but what
I'm saying is like I said you can go
into sports like anchors there are so
many things we can do with you are the
last part of it is feedback universities
so beck universities for undergrad I
look I'm a tree look at undergrad
because I'm mainly targeting undergrad
not graduate students but I will set be
best PR schools in this journalism
school so prevent PR number one was USC
which is the University of Southern
California I feel like that's kind of
like I knew that was coming because it
actually had a yeah yeah right here yeah
USC number two is University of Texas
Austin which I was comprised about and
then the third one I was really
surprised about I was Syracuse which I
didn't rate I do not know sir here yeah
I didn't think that would have been like
I'm like a good PR school but if they
was and then I looked at best journalism
schools number one is Emerson College
which I don't know what that is be
honest it's the best line according to
this list that I got and then there's a
second one if you work at Texas which
really yeah okay and then the third one
is Northwestern or unsuccessfully okay
yeah Norah
the third element Carol I have it it was
on their fancy msl tights but is it top
10 oh okay well you energy is top 10
according to some sites quick stomachs
hot whatever I don't leave ever it is
also because I have a lot of people that
watch my videos that are from North
Carolina like the eastern region I want
to upgrade how did you like even see
like a little snippet they can say and
to the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill and then also like you any
tips for applying like small little tip
because I know UNC is actually like a
school that want to arson and so I feel
like I have a perfect guest right now
you want see how do I describe it I've
actually written so many like claw posts
about it but to me to sum it up I would
say it is one big family like when I'm
traveling when I'm going anywhere if I
see someone you know on the plane
wearing a USB had I'm like oh you're
tauriel we just click and like instantly
we just talk about all the places like
the old well and like oh how basketball
and it's just like I don't even know the
person and we just instantly you know
have this huge conversation you're like
you guys know each other and we don't
and that's one thing I always you know
cherish about Carolina instances people
and how it's like a family and everyone
just you know is all lovey and together
servicing this is like applying I was a
little time ago a me it was essay I
think I nailed it on that day would you
write about your blog know who actually
did it really most people like that do
like YouTube or blog Li write about what
I think I wrote about like my hardship
of like like hard and hard I'm just a
really good essay I just put I think I
literally started writing my essay with
junior year and it just yeah it would
buy a lot like a you know six one thing
it was longer than that but I killed on
essay they look for people who are all
rounders like you know not just good at
one thing but everything leadership is a
huge thing club party
everything and I feel like this key
claw-like what's the other Club Spanish
club German but I don't know like go to
all the clubs be a part of it and have
like you know a lot of leadership roles

application proof you're on your ribbon
