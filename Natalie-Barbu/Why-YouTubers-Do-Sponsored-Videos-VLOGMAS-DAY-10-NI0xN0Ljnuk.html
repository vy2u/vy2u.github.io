vlogmas and i hope that you guys watched
yesterday's vlog because it is freaking
hilarious my friends which people aren't
that when we living with next year they
took over my vlog and i just think it's
so funny i think it's so funny even if
you don't know them like they're just
hilarious people and like it
darah better vloggers than i am so make
sure to go watch that it's so funny i
will have all of my blogs linked down
below I've been vlogging every single
day except I forgot two day I had one
clip from day 8 but I figured it wasn't
even worth putting in the day 9 vlog
because it just was like stupid so
technically I like kind of long but like
not really so I'm just gonna count that
as a loss sorry about that guys but
hopefully yesterday's and today's will
make up for it I just want to let you
guys know that this protein shake very
random I know not something that like
you might have expected me to say but
this protein shake is so freakin good
I'm drinking it right now before I go
work out I'm working out in 45 minutes
it is called core power and it's only
milk so it's just like the powder from
milk they like made it into powder form
I think maybe not maybe it's just the
protein from milk I don't know what it
is I just know it's all milk it's not
protein powder so it tastes like a legit
milk shake and it is only a hundred and
fifty calories it has 11 grams of sugar
and it has 20 grams of protein like it's
so good it's mmm I'm sitting down my
morning routine I'm watching youtube
videos so I just got back from the gym
and I got a notification that I had some
packages in the mail so I'm excited to
open them um so yeah I guess this could
be like a mini haul for you guys I'm
just gonna go over here to get some
scissors I just did the elliptical for
30 minutes I do an episode of friends
but normally like I used to do like an
episode of Gilmore Girls which is like
double the length of friends so I think
I'm gonna start maybe watching a 45
minute long show so I can do that
instead and then I do a butt workout and
I normally do Blogilates she's awesome
she's here on YouTube so it's just free
videos it's great and then I do I just
did yoga today
Yoga stretch and I feel so good I never
do yoga but like I think I'm gonna start
because my body just feels so much
better after just 10 minutes of yoga so
if you guys do yoga let me know in the
comments below all the benefits that you
guys feel cuz I know I can read a ton of
articles but I would love to know
personal benefits to you guys um and
yeah let's open these packages you're
they oh I'm excited to open them yeah
it's a jump rope so I jump rope because
if you guys don't know I also do the
Kayla workouts so that's three times a
week you do her workouts and one that
some of them require a jump rope and I
don't have one so I wanted to buy one I
got that for like five dollars on Amazon
Prime with Free Shipping I highly
recommend it just a jump rope just for
cardio and stuff so bringing me back to
my childhood days except I got black one
you know I'm an adult now let's do this
package I don't know what it is actually
really confused I think I know what this
big one is pay them no idea what this
one is don't even really know how to
open this box okay I'm stupid
can I just destroy the box I'm fine I
literally have no idea how to open this
box package this which is gonna rip it
I don't know oh my god I hate this so
much
what I I'm so envious Sigma here it is
volumizing mousse Sigma makeup brush all
that go litters and it's a message from
instyler which I'm actually making a
video for them so but I thought it all
right I'm gonna talk to the camera I
thought I know I'm making a video for
instyler so I'm really excited about
that so keep an eye out for that I'm
making a video for them and I thought
that they were just gonna send me a
blow-dryer but I guess they sent me all
this good job oh my goodness cuz I have
another box from them I mean it they
hooked me up thank you guys so much
now we open this box oh dang I'm so
excited this must be like the actual
hairdryer that I thought I was getting
cuz they're both from the same address
thank you guys so much for these
products um your packaging is very
difficult to open but that means no one
will steal it so these people are so
sweet please just like buy from them
because of how awesome this company is
hi Natalie we're so excited to work with
you I hope you enjoy blue please don't
hesitate to reach out anytime xx
McKenzie and then she sent me her email
oh my goodness so freakin nice a
handwritten letter who does that the
lightest and most powerful dryer I'm so
excited to use this it's a mini one oh
my gosh I didn't know that they were
sending me all of this like this video
is gonna be bomb so we thank you they
definitely be using that when I travel
because I'm actually traveling to Miami
twice winter break so I'm going once in
the beginning of these winter break and
then once at the end so I will be
packing for two trips and then I might
go to the bat ones also so that will be
three trips so you know I'm gonna bring
that cute little mini so freaky oh my
gosh I love you guys thank you
this is the lightest and most powerful
dryer it's actually so light like this
package is just like so freaking light I
thank you guys so much so you guys are
gonna see some behind the scenes of when
I film this I think I'm filming this
tomorrow so I'm really excited about
this I'm actually gonna put all the
links down below this video like this
blog is not sponsored but like I think
that they are so nice for sending me all
this and like I read reviews online I
like reading reviews online before I
take any sponsored videos because I
don't want to do something that is
crappy because then I'm just not gonna
make a video on it and trust me guys I
know that allow youtubers say this but
like I probably get 3 to 5 big youtubers
get way more but I probably get between
3 to 5 emails a day on sponsored videos
and obviously I don't do that many
sponsored videos so please know that I
say no to improbably
99 85 to 90% of videos first monster
videos because I only want to do
products that I really like and if you
really really like a product and they're
offering you their product for free and
for you to work with them why would you
say no like let's say if Target or
something called you whoever is watching
this or a company that you guys love
asking you hey like we're gonna give you
these this stuff like if you make a
video on us why would you say no look of
course you're gonna say yes if you
actually like the product if you don't
then say no because you don't want to
lose your integrity and you don't want
to lose your character and stuff but if
you actually like a product then why
would you say no that's why I get kind
of upset when people get mad at
sponsored videos like especially people
don't do them all the time if they're
doing them all the time I totally get it
but like if you're not doing a sponsored
video all the time and you do it every
now and then and people get mad at you I
haven't had that reaction I've actually
had pretty good feedback when it comes
to sponsoring videos but when you're
doing something that you actually like
and people get mad at you for that I
think that's really petty it's honestly
selfish and it's really immature
so that's my two cents on that but again
thank you and styler for sending me your
goodies I'm obsessed and I can't wait to
try them so I had no idea but they sent
me this - which I've always wanted to
try it's that thing that like rotates
while brushing your hair currently I'm
eating lunch and I just finished from
making this so I am trying to eat a
little healthier and I know this looks
like a lot of pasta but the sauce that I
put on it is really light so I made my
own sauce and it has a lot of garlic
lemon juice olive oil and pisser and
basil so that's all I put in this and
it's actually so good I love it it's so
so good and the pasta noodles actually
have protein in it and then I just have
some cucumber water so I normally don't
drink cucumber water but I do like it
and I decided I had some cucumbers so I
just cuts them up put it in this water
and I know that it's good like for
bloating and stuff okay so these are the
best smelling candles I love bath and
Bodyworks candles like who doesn't I'm
smelling around lighting up the salted
caramel and the vanilla snowflake one I
also have the pumpkin pecan a waffle
from fall that I'm lighting
because I just kind of want to get rid
of it now I also have these two from
Michael's apple cinnamon and peppermint
but they literally do not smell at all I
just kind of light them up I don't
really know why they are they suck they
do not smell I am about to head to the
library right now I have two more exams
left and trying to muster up the
motivation to go but anyways I just did
a little light face makeup I used a BB
cream just to kind of cover up any acne
or lick scars that I had just because I
didn't want to like go out and public
like that I don't know I just like I'm
insecure
and then I have wearing all black so I
have this Free People jacket my Calvin
Klein shirt that I actually got at like
a consignment store it was about three
to two to three dollars I'm not sure but
so when you go compliment me when I wear
it and they're like is that from urban
I'm like no it's from like this little
tiny consignment store that you probably
donated it to so yeah I'm wearing that
then I got my I have some fabletics
leggings on and I am wearing them as
pants but like I don't have like I don't
know I feel like that's fine it doesn't
look weird and then my fresh kicks these
Nikes I got them on Black Friday
everyone always wears those adidas that
I have and like that I have no like I
have the adidas that everyone has and I
love wearing them but like I kind of
wanted to get another pair that I could
wear in a place of those just because
since everyone has them I like to be a
little bit different sometime so that's
why I decided to get these but my camera
is a low battery so I'm really hoping it
doesn't die and watch it die like the
second I say that but I'm about to go to
the library so I don't know if I'll vlog
there but yeah I don't know what else
we'll do today so
