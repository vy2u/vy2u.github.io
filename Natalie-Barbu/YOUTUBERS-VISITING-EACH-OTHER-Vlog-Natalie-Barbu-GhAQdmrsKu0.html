feel like I just think I don't know what
to even say on twitter like who is
interested in what I need to say and I
don't even know how to put what I want
to say into words and my dogs are
barking I'm sorry about that oh yeah
like I don't even know what I would
tweet but I am trying to
more active on it just because I've
noticed oh my god my dogs okay just
because I've noticed that it is like a
popular thing among youtubers so I feel
like I should kind of get in that loop
