prom looks for you excuse me I've been
getting a lot of requests on my social
media and I wasn't even sure if prom was
still happening but I posted a picture
the other day and someone's like please
post this tutorial for a problem like
yes I didn't miss it I know that I
missed some of your guys proms because
I've seen girls around like my
neighborhood and stuff fitting all
beautiful and glamorous like in the mall
and stuff so I wanted to do two complete
looks for you guys one more like of a
lighter colored look and then obviously
this darker colored look so if you guys
want to see how to get these looks then
just keep watching the video thanks guys
bye so we're going to start with our
sweet look first and I'm just going to
pin my hair back out of my way so it's
not in the way and then I'm just going
to prime my face with benefits
Porefessional I really like this because
it just makes the appearance of pores
seem a little smaller and then because I
want my makeup to last all night long
I'm going to use Revlon's Colorstay
whipped foundation I find that I get a
really long wear out of this foundation
and it makes your skin look super
flawless so that's why I'm gonna go with
moving on to our brows I'm just going to
quickly quickly fill them in I mean
quickly here because it's edited down
like that but you know what I mean
okay on to the eyes I'm going to use my
lorac Pro palette and I'm going to first
go in with this light pink color and I'm
just going to pack that all over the lid
of my eye
then taking like this taupe color I'm
going to work that into the crease of my
eye
taking the pencil brush I'm going to
pick up the color expresso which is just
a deeper darker Brown and I'm going to
start working that on the outer V of my
eye and up into the crease a little bit
just concentrating it on the outer
corner
I'm just packing on the pink again
because I want that to be really bright
on my lids of my eye and then I'm just
going it to blend it all out so it's
super blended and gives it more of a
soft more mietek feel and then taking
the Naked basics palette I'm just going
to use the color Venus as my highlight
so then you want to do some winged
eyeliner I can never film it so then I'm
just going to throw on a couple coats of
mascara
moving on to concealer I'm just using
Mac's Pro Longwear I guess I forgot to
add a clip in but so yeah I'm just
popping that underneath oh you go girl
and then blending it out with my Beauty
Blender
and then to set our under-eye concealer
I'm just going to use a little bit of
translucent powder
moving on to our contour I'm just going
it to use benefits hoola bronzer and a
small fluffy brush just to define where
my contour is going to be and then I'm
just going it to blend it out using the
same bronzer hoola and a Real Techniques
contour brush right on to blush these
are the two that I will be using and
those are boo-boos B and I'm just going
a to obviously pop this onto the apples
of my cheek and push your back a little
bit
and then just blend everything out so we
don't have any harsh lines moving
straight on to lashes I'm using these
from house of lashes I believe they're
called pixie luxe
I'll have the names in the bottom bar
and I remember to just blow on them a
little bit so that they're a little
tacky they're a lot easier to put on
when they are tacky then I'm just
running a little bit more liquid liner
over the top so that deep bands of the
false lashes are hidden brought lower
lash line I'm just going to take a
pencil brush and the color expresso and
just cast a little shadow under there
since we have so much lash going on but
to keep it nice and bright I'm gonna run
a chroma graphic pencil right in my
waterline and we all know this feeling
right here don't we
so we're almost done we're just going to
take the colored Venus from The Naked
basics palette and we're going to go in
and highlight the inner tear ducts of
our eyes and just re highlight our brow
bones I'm also going to run a little bit
of mascara through the tips of my lashes
and obviously we're going to run some
mascara on our lower lash line as well
so onto the lips I'm just going to do a
little lip liner followed by make me
pink from Maybelline I love this
lipstick and then we're just going to
put a little bit of a nude lipstick
right in the middle just for a little
something extra and then I'm going it to
finish it off with NARS ang√©lica which
is just like a super pinky gloss
don't forget to use a setting spray and
we're going to move right on to our hair
so I'm just wanting to spray it with a
little bit of heat protectant and then
obviously just brush it through I'm then
going it to pull all my hair to the
front and I'm going to section off a
pretty deep side part
then using my nume wand this is these
thirty two millimeter wands I'm just
going to take large sections of my hair
and curl it around I think that I broke
it down into about eight sections so I
curled it super super fast it's really
easy
so after you have all of your hair
curled you're just going to want to run
your fingers through it loosen up the
curl give it more of a relaxed vibe and
yeah just run your fingers through it
and you can go through and curl pieces
if you feel like they little need a
little more curl to them like I'm doing
here but just you want it to be very
relaxed and loose then I'm just going it
to give it a little tiny tease in the
back because this is where we're gonna
be putting our little hair piece so then
you just want to start pulling your hair
back and make sure if you're wearing
extensions you hide them with your
natural hair and I'm just going to use a
fancy little comb like this I believe
this one is from Claire's
and we're just going to shove it in
there like so I recommend keeping your
hands holding it and Bobby pinning it
just so that it's extra secure but other
than that this look is complete so I
hope you enjoyed the sweet look and
we're moving right on to our sultry look
so for this one I already have my
foundation done and my eyebrows so
moving right onto our eyes I'm going to
take Mac's soft brown and a fluffy brush
and I'm just wanting it to work this up
into my crease taking a jumbo pencil in
black bean I'm just gonna use this as my
black base and I'm just going to pop
this onto my eyelid and then blend it
out with a brush or your finger
whichever you prefer
taking any black color you're just going
to pop that right onto your eye and
you're just wanting to pack the color on
I believe I went back about four five
maybe six times just to keep
intensifying the darkness taking the
color brown script and then going it to
work that up into my crease as well just
so that we have a nice radiation of
color
then taking the color embark I'm just
going to do the same exact thing just
going to pop that in decrease or a nice
radiation of color and just like before
we're gonna take a large fluffy brush
and blend it all together then you just
want to highlight I'm again using the
color Venus this is my all-time favorite
highlight I pretty much use it all the
time and we're going to just highlight
our brow bone moving right on to lashes
I'm just going to throw a couple coats
on and then we're going to conceal
please ignore the prep and prime I
totally just used the Pro Longwear
concealer and don't worry I'm not gonna
focus on the eye and then we're just
going to blend it out with our Beauty
Blender
and again we're just going to set it
with some translucent powder
moving right on to bronzer and blush I'm
just going to give myself a little
contour with benefits hoola bronzer and
then I'm just going to pop on some Mac
Melba blush
so for false lashes I'm using these from
velour I believe they're called doll
meet up I just love lashes for more
glamorous look so if you have trouble
putting lashes on maybe ask someone to
help you out because I just think they
amp up your look
here I'm just running a little bit of
liquid liner over the lash band
I'm not winging it out or anything I'm
just trying to disguise the lash bands
then you just want to darken up your
crease because as you know sometimes
lashes can change the appearance of your
eye makeup so we just want to make sure
everything looks good and then we're
just going to run a little bit of that
same color and bark underneath our lower
lash line and then don't forget take the
lower lashes with the little mascara and
a little bit on the false lashes just to
blend everything in we're going to
highlight the inner corners of our tear
ducts and we're going to rehire
brow bone and for lips I actually
decided to skip the gloss and just go
with a lipstick you can use any color
you want I decided to go with the Navy
pink once again so moving on to our hair
yeah we're almost done I feel like I've
been talking forever we're just going to
section it off and pull the front
section to the front obviously give them
a little brush through so it's not
knotty and for this one I'm actually
going to use I believe this is the 19
millimeter wand for my new me and we're
going to just curl our whole head this
one may be a little time-consuming I
actually think it's kind of fast though
because you don't have to hold your hair
a bomb on the barrel because it's so
small it will actually curl really
really fast
so this is what your hair should look
like you can leave it like this if you
want but you know me I like big hair so
I'm just going to run my fingers through
which will help loosen up the curls pull
them apart and it's just gonna make you
nice and fluffy and give you nice
humongous hair just how I like
then I'm just going to run a brush
through it again to make it a little
bigger make my hair look a little fluffy
and just give it that really old
glamorous Hollywood look
and simply our look I'm just going to
throw on a crown because why not right I
mean that's what I thought just why not
so that is the end of this video I hope
you guys enjoyed these two looks I hope
you guys have a wonderful time at prom
and until next time I will talk to you
guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
