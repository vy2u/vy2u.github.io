up for 4th of July this year or you're
gonna be more like me and just have a
really chill relaxed kind of fourth of
July like always hang out with your boo
at the beach or your friends and that
too looks for you so first things first
you know we're gonna prime our face and
then we're just gonna jump right into
foundation which is going it to be
L'Oreal True Match of course oh and this
is the more glam version in case you
didn't know
okay moving right on to eyebrows oh wait
I guess I'm going to have a dance-off
with myself first and then we'll get
back to business so I'll leave a link in
the bottom bar for a brow tutorial in
case you guys want to check that out
we're going to give our little orange
cat a kiss and we're going to move right
on to our eyes so our eyes are gonna be
pretty neutral so I'm just going it to
put Mac's soft brown in the crease for a
little bit of definition and the reason
they're gonna be pretty neutral is
because we're going at to load on some
heavy liquid liner which the clip is
coming up because I see it see there it
is ha ha so I tried to actually film my
liquid liner usually I have to be super
super close to the mirror I try to stay
a little further away so I could
actually get it on film and I'm not
really good at explaining liquid liner
while I'm singing there I think so I'll
just let you guys watch this part
so we have two choices you could go for
a more powder eye shadow kind of run
this underneath your lower lash line or
we could go for a liquid liner and you
guys know what I'm choosing so this is
from Milani but I actually don't
recommend it because even though I'm
putting it on top of my black liquid
liner because I just want a little
subtle pop it stain my eyelids so I
don't know how much I would recommend
this one and they were staying for kind
of like two days but anyways moving on
to concealer I'm just going to use some
mac prolongwear and we're going to blend
it out with a Beauty Blender
then I'm just going to set up with a
little bit of translucent powder and I'm
also going out to put a little bit of
lip butter on my lips because we will be
wearing a colored lips and they were a
little chapped so if your lips are
chapped to try to do that before you put
on your lipstick here I'm just kind of
chiseling out where I want my contour
and then I'll go back in and kind of
just blur out the line and intensified a
little bit and I'm just using an MSF for
this so don't pay attention to the pink
blush just pay attention to the blush on
the Left which is Mac's Melba just going
to pop that on the apples of our cheeks
and move right into mascara
and here I'm just using Venus from the
Naked basics palette to highlight my
brow bone and the inner tear ducts of my
eyes
then I'm just going to curl my lashes I
do do it after I apply mascara if you do
it like me just be really careful and
not too cool but as you can see it does
make a difference I'm just going to blot
off that excess lip butter and hit my
lips with a little bit of powder and
moving right on to our lipstick I'm
using L'Oreal's raspberry rush I love
this it's just so smooth on your lips
and it's more like an orange --red not
so red red and I'm just using a cherry
lip liner from Mac to define my lips and
this next move may seem a little sexual
but I promise it's just to get all the
lipstick off your lips so you don't get
it on your teeth so that look is
complete now let's go do something
you
if you guys are wondering how I did my
hair I just loosely curled it with a
thirty two millimeter one from nume I
don't want to bore you guys with another
curling video so I will link a video in
the bottom bar for you so moving on to
our more relaxed beach vibe this is what
I will be doing on 4th of July like
always I'm a Floridian through and
through so we're just basically going to
start oh we're fierce today aren't we
we're basically just going to start the
same way of course I'm going to prime my
face because I can't live without
priming moving right on some foundation
I'm using the new L'Oreal magic nude
powder and I really love it it's super
lightweight the only thing is it kind of
takes me a while to put it on it took me
like I feel like way longer than putting
on any other foundation but I really do
like it it's a really light coverage you
can still see your skin peeking through
so it's great for those beach days when
you want some coverage but you don't
want to have like full-on cake face so
since it was a lighter foundation I'm
just going to do a little bit of spot
concealing with the L'Oreal True Match
concealer crown I always want to call it
a pencil but it's a crown so we're going
to do that and then I'm going to
highlight underneath my eyes with the
Maybelline Dream Lumi um concealer I go
above and beyond you know this with my
concealer but most of it gets blended
out and I just really like this area to
be highlighted and bright I feel like it
really makes a big difference to your
face so I'm not using my Beauty Blender
or anything I'm just going it to blend
it out with my fingers and then we're
gonna move right on to contouring or I'm
gonna mainly I might even call it
contouring I'm just bronzing my face and
I'm using the MSF again
a lot really pink cheeks for this so I'm
using a blush from bareMinerals and it's
just called the French keys and then of
course I'm just going it to run a
stippling brush across my face and blend
everything out moving on to our eyes
because I want them to be really bright
and open I'm using this mineral
finishing powder from Revlon I do
believe it's discontinued which sucks
because it's one of my favorites but
this gives you a really bright I really
wide awake which is what I want so I'm
just going to run this from my lash line
all the way up to my brow bone you
already know the deal with the mascara
and my original idea was to add a silver
glitter liner to our lower lash line to
make it even more festive but my mind
was just at a million place when I was
swimming this video so I totally forgot
so my apologies but if you add that to
your look it would make it even more
festive
so moving straight onto our lips I'm
going to use coral crush from baby lips
and then right on top of that I'm going
to use Revlon's a loveless coral other
than that this beach day look is
complete so I hope you guys enjoyed this
oh and for my harems to wear it along a
straight girl but if this lip isn't
doing it for you you could be it festive
and just turn it into a red lip so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I hope
you guys have an amazing 4th of July and
until next time I will talk to you guys
soon hi
to hearing
Bebe's the damn squirrel I hope I got
that on tape I can't come from Phil how
the damn tree in here where would</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
