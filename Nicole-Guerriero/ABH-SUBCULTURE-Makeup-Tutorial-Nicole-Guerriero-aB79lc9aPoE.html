Okay, so I tried to film this last night
But I think the wrong foundation color and it just kind of threw everything off and then put me like in a grumpy mood
So I did early this morning. I skipped my workout this morning
To film for you guys, okay. But I'm gonna workout later today. So I was opening a couple of packages last night
I know I know so im supposed to  unbox with you guys
But if I don't kind of unbox a little bit here, and there then shit just gets out of control
So there was only like two or three things I unboxed mainly because I just wanted to play with them
So the main thing was the Anastasia subculture palette
I really want to play with this thing because
Apparently it is kind of the sister to the modern renaissance palette and I love the modern renaissance palette so I wanted to give this
Guy a go, so when I was messing with this last night
I noticed that there was a lot to fall out in the shadows
But then I researched and realized that these are softly packed shadows
So there is going to be a little bit more fallout
And you don't need to put a lot of pressure on to the shadow to get pigmentation
So I'll just show you guys really quickly. I'm going to just pick up a little bit of excess
I dumped my brush in there like one time
That's super ***
pigmented so because there is a little bit of fallout if you're kind of like a new to makeup or you just want to get
Crazy when you do your eye shadow I would recommend maybe doing your eye shadow first and then doing your foundation
I just can't do my makeup that way like I have tried, and I can't do it okay
I got to do my face first and then the eyes. That's just a how my brain works
So we're going to dunk into the subculture palette in a minute
But first let's do foundation actually we need to prep our face. What am I talking about? For my primer...
No, no, so for my moisturizer. I'm going to use this guy from SmaShbox
This is their photo finish primer eyes or primer plus moisturizerplus one with a little bit of hyaluronic acid in it
I'm going to use this guy as
but I'm just going to use this guy as my
moisturizer and I'm going to put a primer on as well because I
And then for my primer
I'm going to use a no pore of them primer smooth and poor covering a top secret for perfect makeup
I like top secret things we're going to put this like in our
Heavy pore area I really like I've got it in there
So this guy is only going on these kind of cheek areas, so for foundation today
I'm going to use the new Covergirl healthy elixir foundation with vitamins, this is a lightweight full coverage foundation..Um
And I'm going to use it in the shade medium breakfast, and I'm going to use it in the shade, okay?
I'm going to use it in the shade medium beige which is 742 and I'm just going to put this on a beauty blender
and start working this into
the skin
So this is just one layer of the foundation it is a full coverage foundation
But with me usually even if it is like a full coverage foundation
I'll go in and add like a little more so like my cheek area
This is just one layer of foundation my skin looks really healthy
Did you put any lip shit on today? What is wrong with me?
so right off the bat just super impressed with the coverage and the feel of it like I said it feels really light on the
Skin and it has a nice healthy look to it. I know it's called healthy Elixir Meh
It doesn't have like a dewy finish. It doesn't have like a matte finish
It just has like a look good finish. Yes, all right
I'm gonna quickly do these brows off-camera, so that we can save time. So you know goes, before
and after
Out here debating on what I want to do
I kind of want to do like a green look
because there's like three shades of green in here, four maybe I think when I go into
Voice-over mode now because it's just easier for me to concentrate
Sometimes I get like a little off track and then kind of mess up when I'm like talking to you guys
So we're going to throw it into voice-over mode
While I do my eye shadow and then probably come back
Maybe starting to look we're going to start with all-star, and I'm going to use really light pressure
I'm talking about one dunk kind of situation and a really light hand to help these shadows blend
Usually I want to dunk my shadow in like not my shadow, my brush like two three four times
No, you need like one dunk, and I'm just going back and forth
I always like to use a little bit of shadow and light pressure just in general
But I feel like you need to do it with this palette if you want it to work for you
Not saying that you need to do anything like special for it. I just find that the shadows can get a little out of
Control so I'm using all star just on the outer corner of my lid with a small blending brush
And I'm just taking a little bit of shadow at a time and focusing it on that outer corner
I'm not trying to bring this too far in so as you can see I probably dunked back in three times now
And I mean one baby dunk. Don't get crazy
Moving on we're going to go into the shade Edge
Which is like this really cool yellow, and we're going to pack this on to our lid again
The amount of product that is on my brush is like one tiny dunk
And you get so much color payoff from it
but as I was editing I do notice that
The two colors don't really want to blend well together like you'll see that all star is going to get a little dark on
the Outer Corner which is
kind of a bum because I kind of like that maroon II shade that it was
Then going back to our first brush with no extra product on it
I'm just using that to help the blend and then a clean brush to blend that upper Edge
Just take your time be patient and before you know it the shadows are on. For lashes
I'm going to use these guys from house of lashes. This is their Sephora collection
I believe these are called everlasting and
Then we're going to touch up a little more with edge one the lid because I feel like once your lashes are on you can
Really see the placement of the eyeshadow better or maybe that's just me and here.  And here I'm wondering how
All-Star has all of a sudden gotten so dark
Okay, we're going to conceal
Brand new shape , I use it in light medium of the time
This is just I feel like no concealer. Just even compares to this concealer. I don't know what they do
They sprinkle a little magic in here
Little Fairies you have not tried. Shape tape, your missing out I'm telling ya
And after we're blended you know I'm setting with the Laura Mercier Secret brightening powder
I shouldn't even have to tell you this I probably don't have to tell you this
so I've weaned myself off of setting my face with the Mac studio fix powder and has moved on to setting my face with the
Charlotte Tilbury, Airbrush flawless finished skin perfecting micro powder I use it in the shade, 2
And it doesn't really add like coverage to the face like these studio fix powder does but I feel like since my skin has been
doing
Better like not breaking out as much and not having like a lot of dark spots to cover that I can get away without wearing
This studio fix powder so I just use this guy to kind of set everything and keep it in place
And pushing everything into the skin
So to not like disturb the foundation underneath
So I'm never going to use the KKw 6 here on my channel remember last time I was like
Oh, I want to do an eyes on my face. I forgot
I was like next time will I use it off camera the other day and I hate it
 
That contor stick is a no for me, Kim, do better
So we're going to powder contour today. I'm going to use the Natasha's Denona sculpting glow, and we're going to use the little shade
Obviously excessing which a we got to work with and I'm going to use this morphe brush
it's a 501 brush, and we're just going to
Contour the cheek
for blush
I'm going to use this guy from Dose colors this is from their new meant for you mint for you collection
And this is in the color amaz-int
Oh them apples are popping
We weren't recording, but I thought the lip with a little too pink
So I put on top of it a little bit of the anastasia these are the new matte lipsticks
This is in the shade buff
I'm sorry
I didn't realized I wasn't recording, but I just did the same two colors on the lower lash line and added
Glow getter from my Nicole glow kit. Which is out of stock forever
I don't really know the last time I wore a yellow eyeshadow
But I like it, so that is it guys
I hope you enjoyed um I'm going to be so busy next week
So I'm going to try to pre film some videos and get that shit on lock
So I'll be back soon ok soon ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
