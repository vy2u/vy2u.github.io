all about my hair updates how I get it
to look like this what I do when I
blow-dry at what products I use and
everything under the Sun but before we
jump into the video I just wanted to
take a moment of silence for Talia
Castellano if you guys don't know who
she is she's Talia joy 18 here on
YouTube and she actually got her wings
yesterday at 11:22 so I thought it would
just be nice to have a moment of silence
for Talia so this is for you tea
you
so if you guys want to know more about
Talia I'll leave her Facebook link in
the bottom bar angels for Talia they're
still posting tons of updates they're
going to be a tribute to her so if you
guys want to keep up to date with all of
that like I said I will link her
Facebook page in the bottom bar and I
love you tea that's all I can say so I
know that you're in a better place now
and just know that everybody here misses
you already and you've touched so many
people and just so amazing and I know
that he knows you're not gonna watch
this but it's nice to say I love you tea
so anyways um yeah before this gets
really serious video we're going to
shake it off and we're gonna jump into
the video if you guys want to see what I
do to keep my hair up to date curl it
straighten it blow-dry it the products
that I use how I tease it what hair
color you use the extensions all of that
good stuff
then just keep watching this video
thanks guys okay so since we're starting
from wet to dry obviously the first
thing that we're going to talk about is
shampoo and conditioner and I'm not
going to show you guys me shampoo and
conditioning my hair because I feel like
it's pretty self-explanatory
so but these shampoo conditioner that I
have or that I am using and have been
using for a really long time now well
not a really long time but probably the
longest I've been using shampoo and
conditioner because usually I switch
them up every time I run out but I just
don't think that any drugstore shampoo
is as good as this one so it is the
L'Oreal advanced triple repair 5
restoring shampoo and conditioner and I
just love I just love it I can't say
enough good things about it
it smells phenomenal and it's actually
doesn't cause any kind of build up on
your hair sometimes when I find a new
shampoo or conditioner it's really great
when I first start using it but then
after a couple of shampoos and
conditions it's like it keeps building
up in my hair and I can't get it to wash
out enough and I'm really great at
washing my hair
I always shampoo twice conditioned once
so if you're in the shower and you are
using some kind of sulfate like if
you're using sulfate free shampoo and
conditioner is great good for you I just
need the bubbles and the suds like I
tried to use sulfate free and it's just
it's just not for me but um the way that
you can tell if your hair needs to be
shampooed twice is
when you go to wash your hair the first
time and no bubbles really produce it
doesn't really set up then your hair
still dirty and it needs to be washed
again so I always shampoo twice
conditioned once that's just what I do
I've been doing it for years and years
and years probably since I worked at my
first hair salon and they were like um
you need to shampoo twice and I was like
oh excuse me it blow dries faster it's
smoother it's just I love it I love love
love the shampoo and conditioner I have
tried the other ones from the line like
the color one and the moisture one I um
don't have like a problem with them but
they just do not even compare to the
total repair 5 in my opinion total
repair 5 huh I probably let my hair
towel dry for probably 15 minutes before
I start hitting it with the blow dryer
that's just because I obviously don't
want to be blow-drying my hair for 45
minutes and even though I don't have
like super thick hair I have pretty thin
hair um I always get told when I get my
hair done you have so much hair even
though it's thin hair I apparently have
a lot of it so I like to let it air dry
a little bit or towel dry if you will
before I hit it with the blow-dryer
before I blow-dry I bring it with a
little bit of it's a 10 miracle leave-in
and this is the keratin one you want to
be careful with keratin and stuff like
that or anything that's protein enriched
because it might over dry your hair and
it may become straw like so if you've
got pretty healthy hair to begin with I
would stay away from these products
because any time I recommend or any time
my girlfriends asked me what I'm using
on my hair and then I tell them they've
already got great hair and then they'll
use it and I'll be like ah my hair feels
super strong like I'm like because you
already have healthy hair so why are you
trying to make it more healthy you have
naturally healthy hair and you don't
need a lot of protein or carotene your
hair go for the regular one stay away
from this one so when you get out of the
shower and your hair is damp the last
thing that you want to do is brush it
with like a brush like this you don't
you want to stay away from stuff like
this you either want to use some kind of
wide toothed comb like this side you
kind of want to say I'm having this out
you want to stay more wide toothed or
you can use something like this which is
the tangle tamer and I got this from
Sally's I believe it was only like ten
bucks and this is the best thing that
I've ever used for brushing out knots or
even your extensions when your
extensions are in your hair you it just
glides through your hair because all of
these little bristles
different links so you're not gonna have
to worry about it like pulling your hair
or pulling it when it's wet because you
know your hair is really elastic II when
it's wet so you don't want to tug on
anything like that so when it's wet you
want to either go with something like
this or a wide tooth comb so if I'm
going to wear it straight I do like to
put some kind of volumizing spray in it
and the one that I'm using here is
actually the Nexxus hydra lightweight
list moisture root lift mist and i like
this one because sometimes when you
spray like products in your hair when
it's damp and you're like blow drying
you can kind of feel the product
throughout your hair and I hate that I
despise that so when I found this one I
was like yay this is my second bottle of
this it's amazing it will give you lots
of volume in your hair and not like
super super crazy like you're not going
to come out with like hair like this big
but as you can see I do have volume in
my hair this was from yesterday this is
really weightless as it says Hydra light
it's super lightweight on your hair but
it does add volume to your hair so I
said that so many times
blow-dryer that I'm using is actually an
old-school new me blow-dryer before
everybody and their mom was using new me
I've had this hair dryer for a really
really really long time
I'm sure I have a new new me hair dryer
somewhere around here but I just love
this one is like my all-time favorite
hair dryer it blow dries my hair so so
so so fast and I believe that it has
like the ions in it and everything as
you can see I have no rhyme or reason
when I'm blow-drying my hair I don't
round brush or anything like that
because blow-drying my hair is my least
favorite part I just get so hot doing it
so I mainly try to keep my hair upside
down or my hair flip to the side to try
to get maximum amount of volume but like
I said there's no real technique to it
I'm just blow-drying it to get it over
with so I will just let you guys watch
that
you
so then when I'm almost done blow-drying
my hair I will hit it with a little bit
of the kqc thermal shine spray this is
how I get a lot of shine in my hair last
you guys asked what I use and this is
what I use it's also it's a heat
protector which is great but it does add
tons and tons of shine to your hair so I
love this stuff so like I said when it's
almost dumpling blow-dried I will spray
this all over just to kind of give it an
extra boost of shine
and for straightening the for the
longest time I was using my kqc thermal
no I was using my kqc Flatiron which is
super similar to achieve but in my
opinion better than a cheap because I
have the hiccups I don't know where they
came from
um a chi like my old chief used to when
I straighten my hair it used to kind of
get caught in this area and rip my hair
out but my kqc actually just bit the
bullet like he just died I don't know
what happened to him and oh my god I
think one of the heating plates was
heating up and the other one wasn't I
just I didn't I don't know I don't know
what's going on so now I'm actually
using the new me flat iron which is just
as amazing it's even better because I
like that it has the temperature control
on it right here and then it has like
these little infrared plates if you can
see it it heats up super super fast and
the edges are nice and rounded so if you
wanted to do any kind of curling with
your flat iron you could let me turn
turn this bad boy off so so as you can
see I like to use these smaller ends of
that wide toothed comb that I showed you
using a comb while your flat ironing is
just going to make it a lot easier on
you you're not going to burn your hands
by touching your really hot hair that's
also going to smooth out any knots or
anything while you're straightening so
that's gonna again just make it way
easier and faster for you to straighten
your hair
I also just work in sections when I'm
straightening my hair this is the best
way to ensure that all of your hair is
getting straightened and it probably
takes me about 15 10 to 15 minutes to
straighten my hair
you
god these hiccups are ridiculous come
early so after I blow dry and straighten
my hair and then I decide if I want any
more volume but this is what I do I'm
going to show you guys right now live in
in camera I use the Paul Mitchell extra
body daily boost this is a root lifter
and I do actually spray it on my dry
hair so what I do is I'll just determine
where I want extra volume which is
always up in this area so I can I'll
take this front piece I'm just going to
spray this root lifter right on my dry
hair
Oh shame them up I'm going to use this
Revlon ionic it doesn't spin or anything
like that it's just kind of like a heat
brush
and then you just have more volume in
this area and sometimes I'll go all like
around the perimeter the sides and
everything but for the video I'll just
do that front part so you guys can see I
don't have a mirror in front of me
that's why I can't I keep looking over
at the viewfinder because it's not the
mounts in front of me that root volume
lifter for Paul Mitchell is great it's
another product that doesn't leave any
kind of residue or anything in your hair
it just kind of enhances everything so
love love love this stuff the only time
I usually go to the hair salon is if I'm
gonna get like a haircut like a serious
cut or if I'm going to light in my hair
not like ombre my hair because if I'm
just lightening my ends I I can just do
that myself but I'm going for like
all-over color I will go to the salon to
do it because I don't know I just I
don't want to end up bald but if I'm um
darkening my hair I'll just do it myself
with a box color I've been using box
color for years
and I know some people are like oh my
god don't use box colors but I've never
had an issue with it I don't have any
problems with it I love it it's way
easier and it's like a quarter of the
price the color that my hair is now is
just kind of fading out from the dark
color because when I first dyed it like
in my short shorter sassy your hair it's
like super dark and as you can see it's
just really light now and it's probably
even lighter than its coming off to you
on camera but I actually really like it
so when I first got rid of that light
color this is the color that I use it's
the John Frieda dark chocolate brown and
it is the foam hair color and I really
like this because box dye won't really
cover everything you'll kind of have
like splotchy marks and the foam color
kind of prevents all those splotchiness
from happening it's really really easy
to use and the color was beautiful I
would just say that it washes out really
really easily I probably only had this
color in for like a month and it's super
super faded which is not a problem to me
because I actually like the color that
it fade it to I will be doing this box
color again probably when it just gets a
little bit lighter but as for right now
I really love the color for my haircut I
actually don't have anything crazy
or anything like hey this is how you get
your haircut if you want to wear
extensions in your hair so it's pretty
much all one length
nothing crazy on the ends I just have my
ends cut into like this like you know
so that I don't have any blunt edges on
my hair because if you have like blunt
edges you notice it more when you put
hair extensions in if you have edges or
if you have ends of your hair that are
just kind of cut into like this it helps
everything blend a lot easier I don't
have any bangs or anything like that I
just have kind of shorter layers like
around the front of my face but nothing
super super dramatic it's the hair
extensions that I wear that kind of make
me look like I have more of a layered
haircut but my natural hair is pretty
much all one length except for what used
to be my bangs and that are just now
kind of growing out nothing special so
how often do I get my hair cut not as
often as I should I might gonna say try
to get it cut every couple weeks because
I don't I'm I'm just someone that
doesn't like to get their hair cut what
else
hair fall out I I saw a lot of questions
on that like how your hair falls out but
I just want you guys to know that it is
normal to have tons of hair fall that we
actually lose about a hundred strands of
hair a day so if you're seeing stuff
like that don't be alarmed by it that's
just the natural shedding process of
your hair there's nothing that you can
do to really stop hair fall out it's
going to happen it's always going to
happen and like I said you lose up to
100 strands a day and I know you're like
what I probably don't even have 100
strands on my head but you do so don't
feel bad about it I mean if it's
something excessive like if you're going
like this and you're just pulling out
like mounds of hair you may want to go
talk to somebody because I feel like
that's normal but if you just see like
hair all over the place like I've got
hair on me right now like because here's
two strands 98 more to go let's talk
about hair extensions so the extensions
that I've been wearing um for the past
couple of weeks now have been Bellamy
hair and it's just really nice nice hair
so this is the color dark brown but as
you can see they look a little dark for
my hair but if I
to put these in you actually probably
wouldn't even be able to tell because
that's the cool thing about hair
extensions even though they look like
they're one shade they're actually
multi-dimensional so it helps with the
blending process of your hair like I
said these are 22 inches and 220 grams
and you can just see how thick they are
so I actually have not been wearing 22
inch hair extensions for the past couple
of weeks now because it's just so hot
outside so what I have been doing is
wearing my little shorties um which I
believe these are from SKR I'm not
positive but I think they are I think
the clips are SKR so they just look like
this as you can see they're pretty short
like this and I only wear these two and
then what I've been doing is putting
these longer pieces in the front of my
hair just to kind of give it like a more
like angled look I think these are
twenty inches and I don't even know who
these come from and as you can see
they're they're all different colors but
when I put them in my hair it's hard to
tell I'm just going to quickly curl my
hair with my nume this is the 32
millimeter one you guys have seen me do
this a ton of times I'm just going to
wrap it around the barrel and then I'm
going to show you how to tease it and
make it really big voluminous because I
saw so many comments for really big hair
so that's what we're going to do before
hmm
after after you curl your hair this is
what it looks like not really my style
you can just use some kind of um
hairspray this is a really weightless
hairspray this is the SOI touchable from
healthy sexy hair I love this hairspray
I used to never never never like hair
sprays I didn't like the crunchiness
this doesn't leave any of the
crunchiness but it holds all the curl in
your hair so what we're gonna do we're
gonna flip it and start spraying just
because I want it to be texturized
going to just shake it up okay
Oh attractive then we're going at
tooties and what I used to tease is just
a teasing oh let's kind of fix this for
a second okay then we're just going to
tease our hair a little bit and this is
the teasing comb that I use I absolutely
love this teasing comb you can find
these at Sally's they just kind of have
the three little bristles like this
they're super super skinny and then it
even has like the ponytail if you want
to lose we have that root lift in our
hair it's going at to be way easier to
tease the top you want to kind of hold
your hair as tight as you can that will
help you get like the best kind of tease
that you can
you can keep teasing to get your you
know this area lifted even more but
that's pretty good for me I don't want
anything too crazy but then I need this
area to be pooped out more so I just
take a wide tooth comb like this and
then you just want to kind of go in
between the hair and push it up I do
hold the bottoms because it just makes
it easier you want to try to get in here
to tease it
and want to just hit it with some
hairspray and I like to lift up and
spray in between kind of hold it there
for a second
smooth it out a little bit what I like
to do is take some of my macadamia
healing oil spray this stuff is amazing
you can use it for so many things
just spray a little bit into my hands
and then just kind of come in here and
squish it onto my hair so that it kind
of tames some of the flyaways and like
just the frizz ease and stuff it's huge
then you can just go through if you
won't need to and kind of recrawl any of
these little hairs or you can just kind
of tuck them under and then nobody's
show now some people wanted to know also
which the best hair parting was for your
hair and I think that all has to do with
you sometimes there where my hair - this
side
sometimes I wear - this side sometimes I
wear it down the middle it just all
depends on what my moods feeling like so
when I blow-dry my hair I don't blow it
in any kind of specific part so that I
do have the ability to kind of flip and
switch and all that good stuff I think
that is it for kind of the questions
that you guys had I'm going to show you
guys some at-home DIY treatments that
you can do to your hair for dry hair or
just any kind of moisture or anything
like that so you guys want to see those
then just keep watching but you won't
see me again you will just see my hands
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and again if you want to check out
Talia's Facebook page the link is on the
bottom bar your forever in my heart T I
love you and that's all I have to say so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video and
until next time I will talk to you guys
soon bye
okay for the apple cider vinegar you're
only going to want to use this as a
rinse on your hair while you're in the
shower just dilute it with equal parts
water and let it sit for a minute before
rinsing it out next is coconut oil you
want to make sure you get organic extra
virgin oil this is great if you have dry
brittle hair or if you have any kind of
bleached hair you just want to take it
out run it through damp or dry hair and
let it sit I like to keep mine in
overnight you can also add honey to
coconut oil for a pre-shampoo mixture
you're just going to need to heat the
honey up in the microwave for about 15
seconds
