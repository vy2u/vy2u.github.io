know that it kind of looks like my
everyday hair that I kind of lair but
I've actually curled it a different way
actually the best way you can curl your
hair mine are really like big and loose
because I used a one and a half inch
curling iron this is the babyliss Pro
and is from Flatiron experts this is the
biggest that I will go with my curling
iron because I like this big beachy wavy
look but if you have like thicker hair
or you want a tighter curl I suggest
going with like a smaller barrel that
will help it stay longer I really like
when this hair all completely falls out
because then it's just like wow like I
didn't even try but you know I really
did um this is the look that I like to
wear a lot in the summer time because I
do like really long hair and I like to
have some kind of wave or texture to it
but I don't really want to lose a lot of
links so that's what I why I use the one
and a half inch curling iron so there's
also a surprise at the end of the video
so I mean you could fast forward or you
could wait to the end to get to it oh
this is what it looks like it's really
really long I have in a bunch of hair I
think I have in like 18 inch extensions
22 inch and 24 inch extensions okay I'm
done rambling so if you guys want to see
how to one curl your hair at the correct
way to get this big voluminous crazy
hair three stay tuned for the surprise
then keep watching the video if not hit
the exit buttons thanks guys bye the
first thing that you want to do is just
start off with whatever kind of hair you
want to start off with I'm just using I
believe this is like day-old hair and
I'm just going to first spray it with my
kqc thermal shine spray I love this
stuff I know some of you said that you
don't really like it but I think it's
amazing it really makes my hair shiny
whenever I I get compliments and like
shiny hair like all the time so I don't
really have like the healthiest hair at
the moment because I've been doing so
much to it so that shine spray really
like amps it up a little bit the curling
iron that we're gonna be using is the
baby less Pro this is a one and a half
inch curling iron this is the biggest
that I will go 11 fixes
please okay this is the biggest that I
will go with my curling irons I realize
that I've never done a curling video
like this like I've never shown you that
it's like how to actually curl your hair
with an actual curling iron and not just
wrap it around so what I'm going to do
is um be curling away from my face so
all I do is you open up your curling
iron this is the easiest way that I know
how to do it and then I'll just put my
hair inside like this clamp it down let
it go and then curl it back up and then
let some more hair down well not down
just keep pulling it down and then keep
curling it up and then just hold it
there like that and I'm leaving the
bottom piece out kind of a little bit
because we want it kind of more beachy
like effortless looking hair so now
we're just gonna um clamp and then you
have a nice little curl like that so
that is actually the proper way to curl
your hair so I'll show you guys again
and then we'll talk about what went down
with the fusions
so then again all you do is take it open
it up like to stick my hair in there
push it around and then you can just
hold it run it down twist it back up I
just like to hold the hair just to make
sure it doesn't get like tangled or
anything let it down again keep some
bottom keep I don't know how much that
is just keep it out I kind of wrap it
around the barrel though and then just
hold it there touch it with my finger
look at my mouth looking you guys off
show you guys my amazing animal print
band-aid and I just dropped it down
again
then you have a nice curl it's ours burn
my ear and you have these like nice big
curly Q's this side is like a usually a
little trickier
so then this is what it would look like
if you guys want to when your own Babel
is pro I have to do is leave a comment
down below telling me what your favorite
summer hairstyle is or your favorite
tool a hot tool to use in the summer and
that will ensure you there will be three
winners for the babe list Pro and you
don't have to get the one and a half
like I have you can get whatever size
you'd like and the contest will probably
run for about three weeks I'm not too
positive of what the date is but I will
have all that information listed in the
bottom bar as always you guys want to
enter just leave me a comment down below
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
hope you guys learned how to curl your
hair a different way and yeah so until
next time I will talk to you guys soon
