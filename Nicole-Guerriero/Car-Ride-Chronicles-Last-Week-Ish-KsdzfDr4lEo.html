to like contour highlight and blush
palettes um but it's coming together
it was looking super crazy in here there

thrown into bins and up top is like PR
packages that I just didn't want to
throw away because I just thought they
were too cute like that's cute
so they live up top but still lots more
storage to do I think I'm going to put
to Alec like IKEA Alec stores in here
like the shorties I have two in my other
room so I think I'm going to put those
there so we just have like more storage
but this is all trash that's all trash
it was crazy yesterday like the floor
was just covered in makeup but yeah I'll
give you a better tour once this is a
little more put together and these
shelves are white any day I came in here

wore my way to Home Depot because I want
to hang those lack shelves that I got
for the wigs I showed you guys I think
in the last vlog so we have to get
screws because the shelves didn't come
with screws hanging into the walls but
first we wanted to come get some
breakfast
we're in the Christmas store and they

IKEA shelves the lack shelves so all the
girls will have a home
whoo and we got one wall of wigs up so
just want to thank everyone that
recommended me to drink rice milk with
cereal because I haven't had cereal on
so long because I just didn't like how
it tasted with almond or soy milk I
don't leave like the aftertaste but but
with the rice milk no aftertaste and you
can even chug the cereal milk and it's
still delicious and I'm eating these
guys these are new cinnamon crunch hmm
not as great as cinnamon toast crunch I
feel but they're still good
so it's around 11:40 I have to go get
this pinkie nail fix cuz we talked about
this right I just smashed it into a
while I was trying to turn the light on
and I was going in straight and my
finger just cranked back so then and I
don't really think that I'm feeling this
chrome polish like Charlo said it looks
really good in the Sun but then NASA
went on the dark in the dark like it
looks dirty or something so I'm gonna
get buzzed off and something else
hopefully we have time cuz I have to go
get my b12 shot and my you know phonin
glutathione I did something one that
shoots you in the butt so off to the
nail salon now and we're out of coffee

to our hotel we are at the Sheraton
downtown LA we usually never stay
downtown we you should always stay like
West Hollywood but I have a shoot on
Friday and Saturday and the studio that
I'm shooting at is in downtown Los
Angeles so that is why I'm here in
downtown Los Angeles yeah we got lucky

massive
building right there which I like
because no Sun in the morning of course
and I have a shoe right my face breaks

like it's really it's really cold out
here so I'm gonna go I'm ahead to the
shoot I'm gonna see if they let me um
film but I don't I don't think they will
so we just wrap the chute we got here
back from hotel about 15 minutes ago
obviously I've already taken off that
face when I've had it on for so long I
think it's around 9:45 yeah I think I
got to the studio at like 11:00 today
and then I got to go back tomorrow at
10:30 and do it all over again but I'm
so excited for you guys to see look at
these cool shirts that we got well I got
hey from Hubble studio show tight they
took like they cut them in half and then
sewed them together with like vintage
tees so it's like a Harley Davidson
shirt on the back and then flip it and
it's like Pink Floyd on the front like
how cool is Leia thanks Hubble we just
ordered room service and then gonna hit
the sack because I got another long day
tomorrow
yeah hey when the food comes you dance
so we got back from LA two days ago and
yesterday Jeremy's mom my sister and our
knees came over and I was playing with
the baby and look at this again I broke
another nail and then I jammed this
finger so my knuckles all swelled up
I leave for LA on Thursday again so I
need to get this fixed tomorrow I just
can't believe I've broken two nails in
two weeks
so I just want to give you guys a
forewarning because I thought we could
unbox some packages well I have a little
bit of time and see what we got in here
I'm a little worried because one of the
boxes said open by 12 8 and today is
like the 13th all right let's open some
boxes so this little bag is the new if I
can get it open come on man the new oh
there's a bunch in here these are sight
again Nicole the new and fallible lip
paints coming in January wow so this is
what they look like I'm going to open
one and swatch it to see what it's like
oh well they tricked me guys I thought I
was going to open this and I was going
to be like a like a little doe foot
applicator kind of like the two-faced
ones but look it's a wand I don't know
why I like I like that this color is
sultry sangria this is domineering teal
and we'll just do a swatch of this know
how often you guys will see me rocking a
teal lipstick but I am mad at it because
I like lip colors but let me see let me
swatch I could color that I would
actually wear this one looks pretty
right here this one is taupe 'less i
really like the packaging
yeah like see I would wear this color
right here again that is topless so
these guys launched again in January I'm
going to stick all these back in the bag
so I kind of have like my together
after I open all these boxes
I just broken nail I hit it on
everything this is violet la source on
the line oh the car just says we love
how funny and real I am so this is a
palette that I have this is the holy
grail palette obviously I think upset
like 16 times it's just repackaged like
in way fancy are nice for packaging it's
got a little bit of a hologram globe to
it and this is what she looks like
inside gorgeous who doesn't love warm
nudie colors so mm I love it just like
this palette has like a really nice
weight to it it feels really good so
then our next one is from makeup geek
and these are the makeup geek iconic
lipsticks and their hybrid cream mousse
formula lip creams oh here we go here we
go see we got
Oh two little packages a so I got this
little package here which Oh fancy these
are all 20 of their lipsticks so let me
just pull one out and see what it looks
like oh this is really nice cute
packaging here's what it looks like I'll
give them a little swatch oh it feels
really good too and then this is the
shade shy
this is offbeat if you like mine are a
little extra soft because they were in
the car okay I like the shade - that's
offbeat so these are what's inside the
package and here's everybody's name I
just understand why these are tall and
these are some oh I see why because
these short guys the shorties are all
mattes these are all matte shades and
then the tall guys are all the cream
shades so I'll swatch a few
this is wild child so this is going to
be a matte oh it like starts not you
know how like some liquid lip kind of
situations just start kind of glossy
back I started matte right away so that
is what are you what did you mean so
that is wild child this is another matte
one that's nothing - color of
goody-two-shoes cute packaging again and
I kind of like that they're just matte
right away like I do love a gloss but I
like when something's matte and it's
just matte immediately like you don't -
wait it's just matte boom so that is
goody-two-shoes right next to it and now
let me see what these ultra clean ones
look like let's do a troublemaker and
there are just a taller version
and to troublemaker here and these are
just lip creams I'm guessing they do
kind of have a mat like effect to them
though like it doesn't seem shiny at all
this is it right here on the end hope
you guys are okay with how glamorous I
look today hope it's not like too much
for you okay so this looks like a little
tree like a little cute tree with extra
balls from the ball balls right on get
all this parcel off did you make this
chart no no no I'm just broke one of the
little balls off of it so this is the
new hardest pro glow palette really
really pretty
contour and highlight shades I like um
packaging but it opens like like that
this is from Alison Brod marketing and
communications used to be Alison Brod PR
oh my goodness remember my last vlog
when I was in New York with charlo and
we got to raid their beauty closet these
are the peeps these are the people and
just look at inside of here like what
are these soaps sensitive cleansing set
a cleansing a cleansing oil and a
cleansing bar oh my so they have soothe
and calm firm and lift hydrate and
nourish and exfoliate and detox oh my
god it's a little Peter Thomas Roth set
in here we have the Irish more mud
cleansing gel the mask we have the 24
karat mask and then the 24 karat gold
pure luxury lift and firming cream I've
used both of these masks and I love them
both and I have never tried either of
these guys here and then from Terry we
have some premium illuminating
concentrate I don't know what that is
but it sounds pretty good Lily got some
more mask kind of the same steel as the
soaps that were over there it seems like
the same that are over here for me lift
smooth and calm and we have exfoliate
and detox you
stuff oh my god I love these I was just
looking for these the other day these
are the blemish treatment dots you put
them on your face they have salicylic
acid tea tree oil and hyaluronic acid
and like these little clear covers and
you put them over your blemishes and it
helps them to go away and I just ran out
of mine
whew so that was our last package I'm
gonna go and try to put this in the room
but when charlo comes over tomorrow she
can she don't work on eyes all of that
hey the little tree live over here so I
got to do like little causes from Pier
one mmm and I have more of these they
only had these six at Michael's but I
ordered more so I have them over there I
should open them and put them in but
these two fingers are preventing me from
doing so much one this one isn't really
as bad it just looks bad this guy is so
painful I don't know if you guys can
tell he's swollen but he is so I might
wait till tomorrow or maybe I'll have
Biebs help me when he comes home to
bless all these out because I have more
of them so I can fill the other day over
there as well so I think you guys are
watching this blog right now while
you're watching this and probably in the
shower getting my life together because
mm-hmm yeah so I go and get my nail
fixed tomorrow and I'm sure I'll be
running around like a madwoman because
we leave for LA on Thursday again again
I've only been home for three days and
I'm bout to get on an airplane again my
face is hating me so I'm probably going
to do some kind of mask or something but
yeah I'm gonna try to keep blogging I
