I know it's been a hot hot, hot
Minute since we were sitting here, but I have missed doing makeup tutorials. I have missed just playing with makeup
I have not put makeup on my face since I came back from China what?
What I just miss it I started vlogging because I just didn't want to leave you guys hanging for
Whatever amount of time it was going to be that
I thought that I didn't want to do makeup anymore, but when you kind of leave it alone for a minute
I feel like it kind of makes you miss it and it pulls you back in and that's kind of what happens to me
So a lot of vlogs will still be around I know that you guys enjoy those it just won't be like an everyday
Kind of situation because I realized that my life is kind of like groundhog day, and I just basically do the same shit every
Single day which I understand that you guys can kind of like be into but for me it just gets boring and if something is
Boring to me. I can't edit it. I can't put it on the internet, and that's kind of what happened with me and makeup
But since I took about that little hiatus, and I really wasn't even posting makeup tutorials before I started vlogging
Because I was kind of just over it
But I miss it now like I was sitting in here the other day
and I was like I can't have all this makeup to play with and
What are we going to do?
I'm gonna start incorporating just a mixture of everything onto my channel you guys know that I've started working out
I've been doing it for two weeks. Straight my trainer makes me work out every day
my trainer is Jeremy's brother, so its easy
He took us so beads works out every single day, and I just couldn't work out with him though
It's like I can't have my boyfriend. Tell me what to do even if it is in the gym
He's like do these squats and like don't tell me what to do
so very appreciative of his brother and
Because his brother comes every single day because his brother works at a gym
His brother works at beast in clearwater
If you guys are here in this area, so spec right around the corner from us
So he just comes over after he does like his sessions there, and he comes here
And it kind of motivates me to like get out of bed because I know that
Somebody else's time is on the line and not just me like if it was just me like I'll just wait till like 1:00 o'clock
in the afternoon you know like
Haha, but because I know he's coming it kind of motivates me gives me up and gets me going so like I said once I
feel a little more comfortable with myself I
Will include you guys and the workouts would you like the logs of that be doesn't want to still do some more cooking videos?
Maybe we'll do them a little more professional, and it'll be just like Solely a cooking video with bees
He just kind of feels like a groundhog, too
and he wants to come up with like more recipes for you guys so stuff is just not repetitive ah
I feel like I'm just talking so much and when I do my makeup. I'm not gonna have anything to talk about
But anyways, I have missed you guys. I have missed sitting here
I don't know if this is going to be our filming situation. I don't want to kind of have one just set
Situation you know I want to like move around
It's just kind of tough for me because I am a one-woman show
I do it it is just all your girl tried-and-true YouTuber
So it just is a lot you know getting a life set up getting everything right and ready is a lot
But I have listened you camera now, and it has autofocus. So it doesn't matter where you grow those
Ryoka stuff which kind of is just it helps me a lot because
Before the camera that I was using in the lens that I was using you got like this really nice blurred background that we had
Happening right now, but I couldn't move like I couldn't even move like two right here
Or I'd be out of focus and it would just been
accelerating editing footage and seeing that me like
so it's just so nice now that we have this autofocus way to look tans in focus, so
Shall we do some makeup today? I'm going to use all new products products
I've never used before or maybe like one or two products that I've used before my concealer and my setting powder because I don't think
I have any new concealers here what I have actually I do have two new casilla, so we'll try those
But I just don't know if they're better aimed for covering blemishes covering Dark circles
So we shall see, but basically what is this intermittent, but basically we're using all new products shit that I've never used before
And that's going to be happening a lot because I had a lot of new shit
That I've never used before so let's stop shall. We so I'm going to start
By using one of these little capsules
So I got this guy when I was in South Korea with lancome
And it is it's a prime your use of gold Caviar capsule cream, and you're supposed to take one little gold capsule oh
No, I lost the caviar okay, so I'll write that just perfect. We'll use it
so you're supposed to take one of these little guys and
Smash it
can't find the little thing that you're supposed to smash it with so I'm just going to commit my fingers to smash it and
Then I'm going to apply this to my face
And it just like absorbs into your skin really
Quickly really hook just like that
So now I'm going to go in with this CC cream from a borean this is the high definition radiant face cream
I've seen a lot of people talk about this and it showed up the other day
so evolution ligament oops wait
Wait, oh
With it it transforms into the color of your skin
So I guess it is getting a little bit of coverage. I'm just kind of using it via borean as my layer of
Sunscreen is nice on the skin
Sounds really good, too
And then the last thing I'm going to do before we actually jump in to doing our makeup is I'm going to use
Turn it the right way. I'm going to use this guy from Dermalogica. This is their hydra Blur primer
Looks official. I'm just going to put it in not
Like my little high poor areas which would be right here on my cheeks, so that's nice
We have 18 layers of shit on our face, but really nothing. Haha. We can go ahead and start, so this is the foundation
I'm going to use today is the flawless fusion ultra long wear foundation from Laura Mercier
I'm supposed to have like 15 hours of wear. I've never tried this foundation before clearly we haven't tried any of this well
I'm going to use it in 2 C1
And I'm going to just pump some on the back of my hand and you found a ssin brush to apply it I?
Probably should have pumped this onto this hand so I'm going to use my dominant hand to apply this to my face like
I've never done a before apply it
Goodbye blemish
And then well dab it out with a samba. We did one day coverage is amazing
blending really easily
Okay
She has a couple of different foundations, but I've never found one that I really have like
Okay, which I like a lot of her other stuff, but foundation wise I've never really oh, but this oh
Yeah, she was really nice on the skin and the coverage that's just one layer. That's nice
Okay, so just looking at my skin here. It looks great
Like it looks really good the foundation is full to medium coverage
So it is buildable remember just go ahead and put on a layer if you need a little bit more you can layer it
right over to kind of create a little more coverage and it also is a matte finish, but it's not like a
like A
Like a mask feeling that you know do you mean like I was really into the urban decay all nighter
Foundation for a minute. I mean, I still really like it, but it does feel really heavy on the skin
It feels nice and breathable, so I'm gonna do my brows really quickly
I'm not going to use any new Braille products, so I'm just use my anasazi of brow Powder
I am using a new brush. So does that count I'm using the Anasazi of 7B. Which is a little bit longer
It's a little bit lighter of a brush. I don't know if I like it more, but I have been using it
I really like it though because the brush is just so thin like it's just
something
No brows
Problem, so we're going to use today the urban decay naked
Heat Palette I have not yet played with this palette
I'm sure every mama has but I haven't so I wanted to try it out today, and see if it was
Good and naked palettes kind of hold a special place in my heart because my first kind of high-end palette that I ever got
Was a naked palette I?
Remember like it was yesterday, and then Jeremy's dog
Towards to smithereens, but I still have it. It looks like shit, but I still have it
Debating whether or not I want to prime
eyes
Because usually I don't like primer. We're not going to do it. We're not gonna pry mars because I never do it alright
Maybe we should do it
Right now what I'm not going to do it because I don't feel like searching for a primer for 45 minutes so scratch
there you ready so I'm going to use a
Morphe 513 brush, we're going to start with this cut here soft. I like to start right in the middle
pushing it in
And then just doing like windshield wiper motions
the reason I like to start in the middle of my eye and not like
Here if I don't want to get a lot of product right there, so I want it to kind of concentrate in the middle
So that's why I start in the middle of my eye middle of my lips. We're going to volcano Bay next weekend for
Jeremy's Brother whose birthday
I fell aside in if you don't know what Volcano bay is it's they just opened a new water park in our land. Oh
I think it's only been open for like not even a month yet. Okay, not way to be floating and on raising river all
this
pretty pigmented Little shadow there
it does have a decent amount of fallout in it, but
I'm hoping that it doesn't rain when we go to Volcano Bay I
Probably will because it's summertime in Florida. Did anybody pick up those Sephora pro pallets whether it kind of look like morphine
Natasha's in on her pallets to me
I got two of them
because I wanted to see how they work I got the warm palette and the colorful palette I didn't get the cool Palette because the
Swatches didn't look all that
And I don't really wear cool Tones I
Think oh. We did like one cool tone video in my whole life
Maybe I should we got the cool tone palette. I did love alarm. Yeah, we're going to take this smaller more free brush
This is a 506 brush
and then we're going to go in to he devil which is this shade here right in the middle of the palette we're going to
Pick that up
We're going to keep this color rate in our crease so kind of the same thing just building the intensity
Fully not call it around
and then taking that same brush that we were using before just kind of
softening the Edge
And the Lord can anybody see how much semi from going I got us into started filming so am I limited
Hungry you guys know that I like to go back and forth just using a little bit of product at a time
this I feel helps kind of keep everything nice and neat and
You don't kind of mess up your eye lift by applying too much shadow at once
pieces home
Papaya
You shot out do blend pretty easily and they are pretty significant
I saw a few things when it first came out like I saw some really shitty
swatches and people just like
Losing their mind, and I had gotten my palette that day and I squash them and I said I don't understand
I was like I feel like someone like trying to sabotage them with the swatches even though
I think they were the ones that put the swatches out
So they were pretty she's washes it so far so good. No complaints really blending really easily nicely pigmented
Hug her she didn't do her lipstick
Hello, and then we're going to add in flavel to the crease as well. I'm just using the same brush again
It's a 506 brush and keeping the straddle bit lower than the rest. Oh
That's nice. I like that should unlock a lot at all
embarrassing
with
Jesus
So for the lid I'm going to use one of these guys from makeup forever. This is the Aqua Xl
This is in the shade. I-80. They are
color Paints
And you can use them on your labs on your face on your lips
Basically anywhere your little heart desires you can use these is cream, and then once it's set. It's set like it's not going anywhere
It's not transferring so they come like in these little squeeze tube like this
I have some on my hand like I was watching colors, and they are they're not leaving they not going no
We're just getting on that shade
I'm going to use the shade I 50 that one was a little more pink
and I didn't want to go pays on the lid so I'm going to use I 50 and I'm just going to put
Some of it on the back of my hand. That's way more than you need I
Already know should use a little brush. This is a
19 and
we are going to put this on our lid and
I'm putting the lumber just right on top of that from the pallet
We are controlling our lashes and applying some Mascara to prep them for our false lashes
and
The last day I wanted to get something a little more fluffy so I'm going to use these from the lore
These are their fluffs and cool lashes
They did just come out with like a whole bunch of new packaging and stuff
So these are the clearly to the old ones, but we're gonna wear em anyway, so the new concealer
I was talking about was the skies from benefit. This is the bullying airbrush concealer
it's a pretty decent size - but I don't know if this is like better suited to conceal under the eyes or
Conceal like any blemishes
Which I don't need to conceal any blemishes with concealer because that foundation
Did the job so I'm going to try to use this underneath the eye?
It's going to have paint brush or something
very creamy and
Apply it under our eye
That's nice
No
I don't know. I don't know just a little bit of shape tape
I couldn't resist, I couldn't resist!
There we go
Okay, that's more like it. I tried. I tried. I tried just with the benefit I couldn't do it
Maybe like for a more natural
Makeup look that would be good, but girl do to be lashes. We're wearing and
What is it about that shape tape? Nothing compares to you
Now we can set with the Laura
Wha-hoo movie that from I like to start from the back and work my way to the front
so in the outer corner to the inner I
Don't know just think that it sets better under there
pounces
And then from the outer to inner down outer inner down
I tried, Benefit. Wink airbrush concealer
I like it, but I think it was good, but I think it's more for a more natural looking under eye
I wasn't trying to go for natural today okay? So next I'm going to use this Charlotte Tilbury
This is the Airbrush flawless skin and perfector. I'm going to put this all over my face
I use this once for underneath my eyes, and I was like oh, what are you doing?
and I shouldn't have used it because it was a
Finishing powder, so I'm just going to use this to kind of set a little bit of my face
usually I use the Mac studio fix powder
But that's a little bit heavy. We already have like this matte foundation on
So I just kind of want to put the powder on
to lock everything in
alright, I wanted to use the
new
KKW contour sticks, but I set my face with powder already
So we'll just save that for the next video
They were actually sent to me
because I was thinking that maybe I was the only person in the world that didn't give a shit about those contour sticks
But I wanted to use them for you guys just so you could see how they worked
But I put powder on my face before I did my contour because I haven't really been wearing bronzer
I haven't really been like contouring. I haven't been wearing makeup
So I kind of just forgot so we'll do that in the next video. I have them here
I was going to use them in the shade Medium
But when they came out, I was like, I don't care. I don't care about these contour sticks. Kim K. I love you
I don't care about these contour sticks, but we'll try them in the next video
So to bronze I'm going to use this guy from Maybelline. This is their Master Bronze
This is the bronze and highlight palette they have two bronze shades and two highlight shades
I'm going to use this guy to bronze up my face
Okay, really got to get in there. It seems like seems like you really got to get into the product
 
Hmm, not bad but
Not great you know mmm. I don't know, I don't know how I feel about this. I feel like it didn't go on super duper smooth
And the color is a little weird like look like it's a like patchy right there
So then you can take any kind of loose powder grab some on a beauty blender, and we're just going to kind of clean this up
Like I never do this situation unless
Something needs to be cleaned up
and that bronzer, it needed it
I won't just rule this out completely
I will try it again with like a different foundation
a different setting powder because sometimes those things can kind of work against you with like a certain product, so
For today's look, no, that bronzer not the business, but we will try it again at another point for blush
I'm going to use this guy from Marc Jacobs these are his
Air Blush
 
I've never used any of these this guy is in the shade Flesh and fantasy. It has  a little bit of
a glow to it. Kinda looks like the bronzer
Which I don't mind you like this kind of like Monochromatic look happening
I'm going to give maybelline another try we're going to try their master chrome highlight. This is their metallic
highlighter in the shade Molten Gold - first I'm going to
Alright I've used this but I can't not use okay, it's fine, don't worry about it. 
So I'm gonna spray my beauty blender
Generously, and then just go over the skin
Pouncing over everything to help everything kind of blend and mesh together
And then this also helps to remove any excess powders that might be trying to hang on to the skin
This will just kind of make you look a little more realistic.
I do that before I do my highlight
So it kind of gives my highlight a little extra something to stick to so I'm going to use a 510 brush
From Morphe and we're gonna
It's not like Nicole Glow or anything,
But it's really nice,  I don't know , I don't love a Golden highlight
I think that's what my issue is but the highlight itself is really pretty it's just I don't know something about Gold highlights
I'm going to kind of tone that down a little bit just by pouncing the beauty blender over
which mine mine's a little beat up okay but it's loved, so we're going to use a little bit of a Glo Getter and
Put that here
You yeah, I'm also going to take it and put it here
right above my brows, take it on my finger and put it on my
nose
and then put a little here.
I Don't want to accentuate the chin a lot and then the cupid
Don't be scared, Don't be scared,
to melt that into the skin
Any place
that we put the highlight
For under the eyes are just going to kind of do the same thing that we did on top
So I'm going to first start with the color Sauced
And we're going to go into En Fuego
We're going to push this up on to the lash line
and like this rubato, Mascara
I'm gonna take my beauty blender to go over my lips Gonna
And then for our list, we're going to use this guy from urban Decay. Which is in the shade fuel
And to it. I'm going to add some butter scotch from dose of colors
And then I'm a gloss girl you know it, so I'm going to try this Becca liquid Crystal lip topper gloss
mmm
and Voila!
I hope this video wasn't it too long
I haven't even edited it yet
And I'm sure it's going to be long because the bitch talked the whole way through
And I have really dark hair, have you guys noticed? so thank you so much for sticking with me through my random ups and downs through
This Youtube journey I've been doing it a really long time now
I'm going to be doing a well-rounded channel there'll be beauty videos tutorials reviews hits and misses
Favorites kind of comparisons, I know you guys only want to see a wig collection, so that will be coming very very soon
Also, the vlogs will still be around they just won't be around every single day because like I said it was basically like groundhog day
To me I was doing the same shit every day, so when exciting things happen and even when not exciting things happen
I don't know. I'm just kind of hit
I just kind of see how it goes go with the flow
It's very hard for me to be like a planner like I can't plan things that's going to plan a thing about I'll do them
Because I kind of feel like obligated to do them
I just kind of like to get up see what I'm feeling and go with it from there, so that is it guys I?
Am not going to say the same shit I always used to say so I have to think of something new to say
Or I could just be like bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
