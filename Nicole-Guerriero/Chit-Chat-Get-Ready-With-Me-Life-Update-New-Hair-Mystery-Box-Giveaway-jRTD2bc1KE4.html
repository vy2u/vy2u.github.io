Hello and welcome back to my channel I know where the f have I been
Okay, me going ma. This time was not intentional like it was every other time. I've gone missing in action on YouTube
I just ended up traveling way more than I thought I would be in the month of April
Also, my grandmother is currently in the hospital, which has been taking up a little bit of time
We found out recently that
She has leukemia. She's having a really hard time keeping her hemoglobin levels at a normal number
So it keeps dropping really low and she was in the hospital for about a week
She came home for a week, but unfortunately she is currently back in the hospital right now
So if you guys could please send good vibes to me and my family it would be much appreciated
Yeah, I took our book yesterday, so she said that's kind of helping a little bit
So we're just hoping for the best currently. She is stable. They have her blood at a normal rate
and
The next step, I think they're gonna have to do is remove her spleen because apparently that will help regulate her blood a lot
But then she just has to be super careful because when you lose your spleen you are super susceptible to getting sick
So she probably can't be leaving the house a lot after that
We've heard like I said, I don't really know a lot of like what is really wrong with her
But I've been trying to research more so
I cancelled all my trips in the month of May so that I could be here be back on YouTube either for my mom and
My grandma and for you guys
So this is going to just be a get ready chitchat with me
Wait is that right? Yeah, get ready to chat with me, so we could just do like a little life catch-up
I did lose my vlog camera, so that's why the vlog has have been m.i.a. As well as me
I lost it when I went to Malibu with talk show which was like a few weeks ago
I don't know where it went
Clearly the good thing is is I do still have an SD card that has some footage on it
I think I'm not even sure but I'm gonna insert clips into this video
I haven't even looked at the footage so hopefully I'll be uncertain clips into this video
I have a new one on order
But the one that I was using to vlog with this like my old vlog camera
and it kind of just like malfunctions a lot, so
Yeah, but if I haven't footage
I'll insert it while we are chit-chatting so let me start getting ready while we chitchat instead of just chit chatting and
Not getting ready, and then having nothing to talk about while I do my makeup, so I'm gonna get a little bit closer. Oh
God what's going on? My legs are so sore oh, also. I have gray hair. Don't we'll talk about that too
What's this on my eye and look? I kind of have like semi normal nails for a chance
okay, let's flip of this hair out of the way, no makeup tutorial is complete without the puffs a
sip of water
So let me try to think what the hell has been going on for it wait, let me eat, it's good ol first
I had a coffee, so I'm a little bit. Uh-huh
Have you fried these good Oh
use your fire ah
okay, so let's moisturize the face my face has been super dry because I have been traveling a lot the majority of stuff that we're
Gonna use in today's video too is going to be new products or things that maybe I've only used one time
But I'm gonna try to stick to with just I'm gonna try to stick to just products that are new that I have never tried
Because there's a lot of them. Oh also

A giveaway happening in this video mystery boxes five of them leave a comment be subscribed. That's it I
Like the video too. Why not throw a like in there okay back to the video
I feel like we've been talking for like ten minutes already so my face has been
SuperDuper dry because I've been just doing a lot of traveling, so I'm gonna use this fresh Lotus youth preserve
As my moisturizer today usually you know I am a touch-up water cream junkie
I'm not even sure how much of this I'm supposed to be putting on but like I said my skin has been dry
Okay, it's been pretty good with like its breakouts and stuff, but it definitely has been more on the dry side
So we're just going to work this in and I'm trying to think of like what I've been doing like
Everything just seems to be like such a blur so
Let's start at the beginning of the month April first. What was that that was Easter? We didn't do too much
We just went to Jeremy's mom's house
To see his niece
Who is 4 her name is Evelyn if you guys don't know who I'm talking about
I refer to her as they bean so we went over there and just had Easter and
Then I feel like we left
And is that when I went to Tasha this actually feels really nice on the skin. It doesn't feel too heavy or too
Thick so I feel like this would be a great moisturizer to use underneath your makeup
I am gonna let that sink in for a second though
Gonna moisturize my lips as well
this is the bite Beauty agave lip mask and
This isn't a new shade which is lavender which I believe used to only be available in Canada
But it is available now. I feel like it's a lot easier
Just we've squeezed out of the tube than it used to you're technically supposed to wear this lip mask at night
But I like to wear it before I put them on makeup so like I said
I lost my vlog camera from the time. I got to the airport to the time
I got on the plane when we were going to Malibu with Tasha speaking of Tasha
I am going to use these silk canvas primer and usually I think you guys know that comes with like a little scoop
I haven't been using a little scoop
I've been using just my fingers like this and kind of working it into the skin like the
So I lost my vlog camera, and we just went to Malibu for like two days with tatcha
Just as a kind of like a little gratitude or treat. It was really relaxing
It was right on the water like I felt like I was on a cruise ship
Because that's how close we were to the ocean
It's right next to Nobu Malibu like Nobu actually has like a hotel if you ever have a chance to go to that hotel
Go to it. It's so relaxing and just so Zen. We did like a class that like taught us about crystals
Well like taught other people about crystals
Which was really cool? We got to do like meditation classes with a monk
That's like a twenty fourth generation monk during the crystal class we also got to make our own crystal beaded bracelet
So mine is jade and amethyst this one Bebe's got me
What is going on here like am I breaking out in a rash right now. Let's go. What's happening
Hey, all right. There are a couple of new foundations that I want to try and I just don't know which one
I think I want to try the new do your undercover full coverage foundation
What is going on I feel? I hope that God not having like an allergic reaction to something
It was my first time trying this fresh youth preserve, but
I'm just gonna it doesn't itch or anything
Hopefully one of these colors
We're gonna go with 20
I'm not really sure how you're supposed to apply this I quit boom this is full coverage 24-hour full coverage foundation at fresh light
weight
weightless
weightless foundation
Girl with what I know I'm gonna go with my Beauty Blender. It doesn't feel weightless it feels like it's stick in there
I'm just gonna squirt some of this on the back of my Beauty Blender
Not sure how much I should be using here
And we're gonna
It's just too light this
That might be too late for me, just real light for me, we're gonna make this work
No, that's too late for me, let's try 25
Okay, 25 is better
Pretty good pretty good. I'm just I still feel like I don't know the right amount that I should be using here
So I know I touched on my grandma a little bit in the beginning of the video
And I think I just tweeted the day that I found out that my grandma liked that she had leukemia like I just tweeted it
Cuz I was like didn't know what else to do
I really liked wheat like personal shit like that
But so many of you like just said so many kind words so if you are one that tweeted me
I just want to say thank you guys for that because it was really like
encouraging my grandma is
77 she'll be 78 this year in November so - Scorpio
And she's never been sick in her whole entire life
This is the first time I've ever seen her
Not moving around like she was super active heard my mom lived together and my mom has
Seven cats and she's always taking care of them, and the dogs, and she's like always out in the garden or doing something
So it's just really
Weird like weird to see her in the hospital
But I'm just trying to keep a positive mind with everything, so I just want to say thank you guys because like I said a
Lot of your tweets. We're just very encouraging and very sweet, so I appreciate it very much
We're gonna move on to our brows right right is that what we're gonna
Do so I feel like this foundation is actually a little bit much more matte than I appreciate
We're gonna. We're gonna. We're gonna. See how it finishes and with setting spray and like all that good stuff
So I'm gonna do my brows real quick and just insert some vlog footage
Not sure what its gonna be but it's gonna be some vlog footage
When your snaps don't work
And
And listen, I know I'm dark eyebrows. I'm well aware of that fact, okay, but did you see my natural brows? They'd zark?
What am I looking for you're looking for concealer? Yes, I am
I
Think I'm gonna use the Laura Lee new dia patootie
So this is what the palette looks like I think I'm going to use a few of
These shades for like my crease color because I want to use one of the Jennifer Lopez what do these pure pigment?
Eyeshadows I want to use one of these like all over Z lid
And I like the shades streaking and butt-naked in this palette. I want like a fluffy brush
Like this
Yeah, like that so I'm gonna start first with the shade
Streaking so I was in LA about a week ago
I went for the milk makeup launch and then I knew that I was going to
Vegas right after that the milk makeup launch was for their new mascara. We believe it's called Kush mascara and the reason that they use
CBD oil in is because they wanted to make it vegan so by removing the beeswax that a lot of mascaras have they
Replaced it with I believe CBD oil
Which now they have a vegan mascara?
anyways the launch for that was the day before I was supposed to leave to go to Vegas so I flew out there early because
Stephanie who used to work for benefit works for milk makeup now, and she's just the homie, so I wanted to go support
So that's why I was in LA for legit like 24 hours, and then just went to Vegas from there
So I'm going in to work this shade which is called streaking. I'm going to
buff this into my crease
Store your time you ready so a few years ago my Instagram account got hacked and that's how I met my current manager
I'm still working with the shade streaking. I'm just kind of
Buffing and building this into the crease my Instagram got hacked a couple of years ago
And I just felt since it got hacked
it was just never the same like I felt like my growth kind of just stopped, and I just kind of plateaued on Instagram and
I just never knew why so the impressions were really good the interaction was really good, and I was just like alright
I'm just gonna let it live maybe people just don't like anymore, but I just kept my Instagram account
Recently just found out that my account has been shadow banned on the gram if you don't know what Shadow Man means it makes basically
Means unless you're following me on Instagram
Nobody can see me like usually people will be on the popular page and like I said because I can see insights on my pictures
And stuff it should say from explore meaning like if you're not following me. You could see me on the explore page
No, you can't if I use a hashtag. You can't see me basically you can only see me if you're following me
Fun right and really the only way to kind of get unshadowed banned
we're taking a meeting with Instagram and hopefully we can kind of figure this out and see why my account got shadow banned I
Looked I was I was looking it up when I realized that I was innocent either
You're posting and frequently you're posting too much or commenting too much, and I'm just like why would they ever do this to somebody?
Why Instagram would you ever do that to somebody and a lot of people were saying the only way to really fix being a shadow?
Band is to just delete your account is just to delete your account and start all over and I was like
No, I'm not doing that hopefully we can get that
Situated cuz that's fun because even though it's just like Instagram
It's still like would be discouraging when you're just like sitting at the same number for 18 million years
And you're just like great great, but then you look at your insights
and you see like your interaction and your impressions and your likes and stuff and those are also really good and just like I
Can happen anyone - apparently so if you feel like your accounts just been like stuck, maybe check to see if your shadow bands
So one is if you have a verified account you can see your insights and - if you turn your account into a business account
You can then see your insights and at the top there should be like a little bar graph
Situation and you can click on that and then at the bottom
You can see like your impressions, and it'll say like my number will usually be like in the millions, and it'll be like
1%
of
That number we're not following you when real that number should be like 40 50 percent
But it's not and also it should say from Explorer, and if it doesn't then
Congratulations your shadow band like me you can eat my feeling
I'm gonna take this book naked butt naked shade as well and a smaller brush
I like a littler brush like this and start to focus this in my crease as well
I always like to start in the middle of my eyes, so that's where the most amount of pigment goes
Because sometimes when I would like start on the outside of my eye
I would place just a little bit too much product out there so by starting in the middle it really kind of helps and
I don't know if you guys can tell, but I'm not doing like windshield wipers. I'm doing like little
Tiny circles on my eye, and I'm trying not to use a lot of pressure
I'm trying to be more light handed with my makeup application especially on my eyes
2018 I decided that I wanted to kind of
Hone in on my makeup skills and really start to practice and just do more with it
So the glam master kind of series will be back which is kind of challenges my great creativity
but with eyeshadow and stuff
I just wanted to start doing more because I felt like I just
Would always get lazy with IRA shadow just because for me it takes a long time because I just want to blend this shit forever
So I just kind of got in the habit of doing really easy natural eyes. I'm using that same big fluffy brush
I'm picking up a little bit more of streaking and just kind of buffing that on top
and this year
I just wanted to kind of just challenge myself and just take my time and do my eye makeup like
What else we doing girl? I just have a little bit like I pick up just the smallest amount of product because I
Know you guys probably heard me say this a million times
But it's a lot easier to add product that it is to remove products
So just work with a little bit of shadow at a time. You don't want to get anything, too
Heavy just in case mmm. You. End up. Not liking it so now that I've got in what?
Four new tattoos in the past couple of months all I want is more
I think the initial tattoo that I got when I was 18 just scarred me so bad because one the tattoo artist was mean
To it hurts so much because it was my first tattoo
That it just kind of prevented me from getting more tattoos, but I've always enjoyed them
I wish that there was like ink that kind of disappeared so I could have like a full sleeve
But then like in a couple years, it would be gone because I would never get something like huge. I just like really tiny tattoos
So I have another tattoo in mine, and it's gonna be right here, I'm not gonna tell you guys what it is yet though
but hopefully like my mom and shit will go with me and get one a
Lot of people have been asking me to like oh you look different
What have you had done to your face?
And I'm just like what so the only thing that I've ever done like
Filter wise to my face is have filler underneath my eyes
I have a little bit of Botox like right in here because this thing is like deep
but other than that this is
My face, I still want to get my lips done. I go back and forth with it
but I might just stick with these lips I
Kind of want to get Cabella, which is like a little you get like injections right here
And it kind of dissolves like your little fat
Cuz this I was reading like it doesn't matter like how much you exercise like once you get like this guy going
There's really no going back somebody told me just lipo it out cuz it'd be like a lot easier
Then kybella cuz I guess you have to give like a bunch of kybella treatments
But I'm still on the fence like anything that I have to be put to sleep for scares me surgery wise
but uh yeah, I just have under-eye filler, which I haven't gotten in a
Really really really really long time like at least
Probably two years right one - yeah at least two years since I've gone under I feel there
Yeah may will be two years that we've lived in this house
And it's been longer than that so it does last a really long time. I probably had under I feel there done
Three times if you look back at older videos you can actually see like how hollow my under eyes were so I'm legging those two
shades and
I think I'm gonna cut it with this Silver Dollar even though. It doesn't look silver
It looks like it has like this like pinky. You're a destiny to it
I think this is the shade that I am going to go with
So we're gonna do a little like half cut crease because you know I'm really into that I just think it looks like super clean
And for me because I do have a little bit of a hooded eye, and for people that say I don't have a hooded
Eye like maybe when I go like this
it doesn't look like it, but if I'm relaxed this top skin is definitely covering my crease like it's
It's hanging over, so I'm going to use this P Louisa base
If you guys do not know the people use Academy on Instagram you are missing out on life. It is very dramatic makeup
They're from the UK, but it is so inspiring like the makeup that they do is so
Flawless every time I look at it. I'm just like oh, so I've been using this base for a while
I believe this is the original one, but I think she does have more colours now
I'm gonna take a flat brush like this pick up some products, and I'm gonna do my little eye trick
So we're gonna put some of this
right on our lid and then look up and
Then wherever it hits. That's where I know my marker is and we're gonna cut our crease
- just give it a good Pat
Just kind of set it, and you don't want this to be like super creamy and like liquidy esque
when you put your
Whatever you're putting on top you can put a shadow pigment
I'm just going to use a pigment today like I said
I'm going to use this pure pigment from the JLo Inglot collab as you can see it
Look looks like I does a little bit of a pink vibe to it
But it's definitely more on the silver side and we're gonna put this right on top of our base
If you guys don't know I was just in this with Inglot to
kind of celebrate the launch of the JLo times Inglot collab I
actually got to meet
Jennifer Lopez like be in the same room with her not even the same room like it's okay. It was pigment getting everywhere
It's all about
Not even the same room with her like in her actual personal dressing room
With like an after party up there because we went to go see her all I have show
Which I'm pretty sure was the last one. She's taking like a little break. I think only for like six weeks or so
But yeah, we got to actually like hang out with her and vibe with her
And I was just like this close to her like we were just having like a conversation just nonchalant me and JLo
Chatting it up, and I don't know if you guys know this I'm still just kind of working this pigment
I want to get it like right on the tip of my brush
So I can get it right up to that line so one second, please
So I will say about this JLo pigment
I feel like it would be better suited to use this with your fingers, but since I got like 47 inch claws
I can't really get my finger or
maybe I could
Yeah, if you use your finger you're definitely having an easier time with this I
Also, don't know if you guys remember, or if you've even been following me for this long or not
But like in 2015 when I had like blondish ish hair
I did a JLo like hair tutorial
And she ended up retweeting it and tweeting me following me on Twitter and following me on Instagram
And the whole time everyone's like tell her she follows you tell her I'm like. I'm not telling Jennifer Lopez anything, okay. I am not
So great when we were getting ready to leave Alyssa was actually like you know you follow her on Instagram right and she's like
Yeah, I thought she looked familiar. You're from Florida right. I was just like
The Queen knows where I live like it was just so freaking surreal
She was so cool you guys like
like
Super cool her mom was right next to us like her mom Lupe was sitting right next to us when we were watching her show
Her mom is like a 76 year old woman and she was out there
dancing
Non-stop, she was definitely living her best life at her daughter's concert
I'm gonna go back in to the nudie patootie palette
And I'm gonna pick up a more flat shader brush again little guy
And I'm gonna go in first with the shade butt-naked and kind of focus this on the outer corner
I'm gonna take the other side of that brush and pick up a little bit of streaking and kind of add that
On top of that and mesh the two together
I have pigment all over my face. It's fine. It's fine
I'm gonna wear my Eiler lashes because I haven't worn lashes in a really
Long time because I had this lash lift happening
And I will say lash lives is cool and all but if you want to wear lashes
It is so hard to put your lashes on when your lashes are lifted
And if this is the first time you are seeing these lashes these are from my collab with eye allure
This is my faux flawless set which is probably my favorites of all three lashes
You got to pick a favorite right? So this is definitely my favorite it feels so weird. I like throw myself in the garbage
I'm just like alright girl. I then like to go over the lash with a liquid liner. Just kind of disguise the lash band
Okay, the reason that these lashes are like one of my favorite pairs of lashes is because I feel like you didn't like a lot
Of a length and volume from these lashes, but they're also not a lash. That's going to cover up completely
The work that you just spent doing your eyeshadow it took me a second to realize what I wanted to say
But I got it together
Because I feel like sometimes when I put on a false lash that it just completely takes away from the eyeshadow
So I've gotten now to where I know all right?
I know I'm gonna do a look where I'm gonna need my lash to cover my eye
Completely because I'm not gonna do a lot of eyeshadow
But I feel like when I spend a lot of time on my look
I like to wear a lash that kind of displays all that and this lash kind of gives me the best of all
Worlds in one lash. I also added a little bit
I'm sorry don't realize the camera wasn't recording, but I also added a little bit of Nicki Nicki. Which is just a
darker brown shade and
Above that a little more
So what do we think of my natural esque looking nails?
I just don't have time to do crazy designs because the same day. I got my nails done
I had to go back to the hair salon for the second day
To finish this hair, so yes
The purple is gone
And the gray is in I also got new extensions put in I'm currently wearing the great length hair extensions
Which are like the individually bonded in hair extensions?
Which I think are a game-changer? They're definitely more time consuming for installation purposes
Because they put them in one by one but I think for like longevity
They're the best and the least damaging on your hair
Because I don't feel like a lot of weight pulling my hair like when I used to wash my hair with tape and extensions it
Would be so heavy and with these it's like you don't even have extensions, and they're so lightweight
She's a little uncomfortable the first couple of days cuz your head's a little sore because they're so close
to your scalp
But I think I've had them in for like three days now, and it's getting a little easier to sleep moving on to concealer
I'm gonna try these new Laura Mercier flawless fusion ultra long wear concealers. I think I'm gonna use it in the shade
1c because to see I like the more peachy tone that this one C is giving off
So we're gonna go with one seat
I've currently have been using the k'kaw beauty ones, and I actually really like those concealers like I didn't want to
but they're pretty good I
Haven't even used Tarte shape tape like who the get my so concealer is my favorite part
So I go a little bit ham sandwich on it
But if you are new to concealing and stuff like that new to makeup in general just
Concealing in this like more triangle form it's just going to help conceal dark circles. I'm looking for a brush to blend it out with
What can I blend it with
Really it's not did it say it was full coverage
No just said flawless fusion okay, so it's definitely not a full coverage concealer I
have to put a dab of
Something else on top though, so it's super easy to blend out, but I like a more
full coverage
concealer
Especially if I have like a full coverage foundation on I like my concealer to be equally as powerful
I do like this color get that crisp, but I can still see kind of my bluish
Dark circles underneath which I don't like that, so I'm just gonna add a little bit of the k'kaw Beauty concealer
And I'm just gonna put that here
This is in the shade 5 a little bit added
coverage
Hello to set my under eye concealer I'm going to use this new hourglass
Translucent setting bit what so just that my concealer? I'm going to use this new hourglass translucent powder Oh
OPA, so I'm just gonna tap this out one more time
And look up and then hit my under eyes with this. Oh, that's nice. Oh
That is
Did you see that different like look at doesn't this eye look way smoother than this side
to me it does
Get a little bit more in there
So you can use actually they gave me a brush with it
this is the brush that actually you're supposed to set it with but it just looked too nice and new
This is
beautiful so you can use this translucent powder to set underneath your eyes as well as your entire face I
Feel like companies are just stepping up so much with their translucent powders because before remember. I just used to be locked and loaded
On the laura mercier secret brightening powder I didn't even really like her translucent powder which a lot of people did
But now I like so many different setting powders like I love the Mac Patrick Starr one the k'kaw Beauty
One is actually really good, but I think this one might be the best
That I've used
Yeah, that's really nice
Again, this is the veiled translucent setting powder from hourglass
and
Yeah
It's a yes
I think I'm actually gonna set the rest of my face with this translucent powder as well because
Why not and I will use the brush?
that it comes with I
Feel like this foundation probably doesn't need to be set, but I just feel like if I don't set my foundation
Before I put on like my bronzer blush
Situation that it just doesn't go on as smooth for me
Wow
I'm here for this translucent powder and
This brush is so soft
For my bronzer I'm gonna use this Too Faced chocolate Soleil
I feel like I should probably be using like chocolate because these bronzers are SuperDuper pigmented
And I originally thought that chocolate would be like a good mix for me
But I need to be very light handed with this bronzer
I have used it before but it's still new to my routine so I'm
Smells really good too, so I'm just gonna take this little
Brush right here and really tap off the excess cuz like I said it. This is a super pigmented bronzer
And light hand rakers get into these hollows
You see what I mean, I didn't tap with my brush
We also sent a master class with Scott Barnes
Who if you don't know who Scott Barnes is he's basically like a legendary makeup artist
he's
Pretty much responsible for creating the JLo glow and he set a place to never forget to contour is always like right here
Just so you kind of cast that shadow underneath your jawline, and then he connects it up
To your her contour
So I've been contouring this part of my face for no no ever
But it was cool to hear him kind of say don't forget that part of your face
I know it's like totally random
But they told us to just pick what we wanted the Inglot store so my little freedom palette kind of is all over the place
Clearly I was selling my purple vibes, but I'm going to use this blush
I'm just going to use a little bit because it looks like a pigmented ass blush and pop that on our cheeks
I don't know how my phone keys cough so much
And if you ever feel like you put too much blush on which
Happens to me all the time. You can just take like a large stippling brush and kind of just work it over
And it'll kind of take off like excess product and just make everything blend more seamlessly
We are getting places we are getting places
And I've been wondering like since I got my hair done like should I just go get these roots done and have them be like
All gray or should I just leave the roots
Cuz then it just helps my eyebrows look not as dark as you can see my dark ass hair, too
It was my first day working out in like
Six months I can barely sit down
Alright, we're gonna do highlights, and what do I want to use?
for my highlight
I can't find the one that I want to use but this one I feel like is super similar to it
These are from Inglot, and this is the sparkling adjust face eyes and body illuminator
I wanted to use the Jennifer Lopez one
I think it's called living the highlight, which is the one that I like it's basically just a loose highlight like this
But who knows are there a girl who knows where they at I'm also going to spray my face first. These are the new
Fix+ pink light which I have a little bit of I guess
They come in pink and gold I'm gonna give my face a little spray
More a lot of spray, I'm gonna just pick this up on an honest hacia brush
And then we're gonna hit the high points with this
It's intense so tap off the excess and then just
Okay, my phone is being really annoying
Mm-hmm I'm gonna keep it. Hi. I'm not gonna bring it like all the way down just cuz it's pretty intense
And do some on my nose
Which that ends up disappearing so I don't even know why you do that, and then I like to do something like just right
in there
I'm gonna do a little bit of shadow underneath the eyes by taking a little bit of butt naked and
Streaking just like a combo of these
You guys know I don't like to do too much underneath the eye because it irritates me
But I feel like we have a lot happening on top
So we gotta kind of balance that out
That's I don't like from my lower lash mascara. I'm going to use the Jennifer Lopez Inglot. This is viva los lashes
I believe and I really like this because it has a
Super tiny wand which is perfect for getting the lower lashes
Most of the time I use a brush that's like ginormous
And I get it all over my face because I have a lot of filler underneath my eyes
So I like this brush because it's teeny tiny and you can just get in there without
Fucking shit
And then for my lip I'm basically just gonna do my signature lip because there's not like a lot of new
Lip liner is happening as well as lipsticks what I'm really into though
Is that everybody is on this gloss kick which I'm here for you guys know. I'm not a matte lipstick girl
I'm a gloss girl, so
What consist of my signature lip is first stone lipliner? I?
Don't know why I love this little hunter so much like so good a little fill in
We're gonna go in with 535 from
Maybelline remember I said I feel like I said in the last video that I was use these anymore
All right, I know it looks harsh, okay, I know it looks harsh. We're not done
and
Then I'm going to top it off with the gloss the gloss changes a lot
This one is just going to be Mac gloss in a seat through
The gloss also kind of helps to kind of mesh everything together and make it more seamless
This is basically the lip that I wore the entire time in Vegas
Because I was trying to give like Jennifer Lopez vibes that whole time all right
Brush my hair so now that you can see my hair in full effect should I keep the root?
Or get rid of the roots
I don't know. I will do an updated color care situation here and even talk about what I did for my purple hair also um
You can expect that soon because a lot of you have been asking just don't wash your hair dry shampoo life
So I enjoyed talking and chit chatting with you guys
I haven't done a talk through tutorials so long cuz I just feel like this video is just gonna be
As I feel like I just ramble and I'm pretty sure this video is going to be so long
But it's okay because I've been gone for a minute. That's not happening again. It was not intentional
I was not trying to stay away from you guys
