It was loud in my last video cause I forgot to turn it off okay, fan. Let's just wait for the fan to be quiet, and
We're good. Welcome back to my channel.  Today we're going to do a little bit of
Favorites I have a lot more skincare than actual makeup because you know what it is
I wasn't wearing makeup, okay?
That's why I keep trying to put as much on as I can
For when I film these videos so before we jump into the favorites
I first want to talk to you guys about audible and sponsored videos on my channel
So you guys know that I have partnered with audible?
But I don't want to do a lot of sponsored videos on my channel anymore because I realized the reason people started following
YouTubers in the beginning was because you got honest real raw opinions on products that were bought by them and
Weren't sponsored by other people so I kind of want to kick it back to
that and kind of step away from
Sponsored videos basically everything that I'm going to mention to you today with the exception of like one thing
I have purchased with my own money a lot of the products that I talked to you guys about I have purchased
Myself if I haven't I will let you know that I got them for free through Pr
Or whatever which is just a perk that comes with being on YouTube for a long time?
So I kind of just want to step away from Sponsored videos
I am going to finish out my contract that I do have like with audible
I genuinely love audible never done a sponsored video that I didn't actually like the product I've turned down tons and tons and tons
Of money because I didn't like the product they wanted me to say something that I didn't feel was true
They wanted to kind of change
who you are to kind of like make you like a robot which I didn't I didn't want to do so I've turned down a
Lot of deals because I didn't feel like it would be true to you guys
And I'm not saying that you can't give your honest opinion because you're being paid to give your honest opinion
I just realized that I got you guys without doing sponsored videos
You know what I mean, so I want to kick it back to that make it more real make it more honest again
I'm not shading anybody that wants to do sponsored videos. There's nothing wrong with it at all when people started YouTube
They weren't starting with Sponsor videos in it you know
I mean like you work your way up
and its kind of like an honor when a brand reaches out and wants to do a sponsorship with you because
Anyone that started on YouTube started from the bottom and work their way to where they were offered these deals unity means
So I just wanted to let you guys know that I will be stepping away from Sponsored videos
I do still have a few that I am obligated to and of course those videos that our sponsors will be fully
Disclose to you guys, but once my obligations are fulfilled. I will not be doing
Sponsored videos anymore, but I still have this audible one. Which you guys know. I love audible okay. I love it
I would not talk about it as much as I do to you as if I did not genuinely love audible
It's just nice sometimes to get like a change in the car
You know what I mean, and I think our battery's gonna die so let me change the battery and then we'll get back to it
I just sat there and talked to the camera for a good
Six minutes, and we're filming it. I recommend a lot of books to you guys
I feel in the time that I've been talking about audible, but I feel like this book is probably the best one yet
so I'm currently reading
the book I'm currently listening to is breaking the habit of being yourself by Dr. Joe Dispenza
So basically my whole kind of self empowerment has been about
The power of attraction how your mind can give you exactly what you want?
And I'm a firm believer in that I feel like some people think that they are but deep down inside
Maybe they're still doubting it
and that's why it's not working this kind of breaks it down in a more scientific way and just
Speaks to you like on a whole new level
It's definitely been one of the best listens I always want to says reads
But I'm actually listening to the book if ever did one of the best listens that I've had in a while
I haven't found any that I really loved in a while
So I've been just kind of going back or reading just like big little lies
I was into and harry potter and game of thrones, and I couldn't find a really good one, but that guy is
Legit I feel like he will not let you down, and it breaks it down like I said in a more scientific way
So you can be like oh like it really clicks more in your mind
That the power of attraction is real and anything that you want is totally attainable if you just believe it and feel it in your
Bones so I don't want to give too much away
I will let you guys get into it if you want to so if you want to start a 30-day free trial with audible

easy to do they have an unmatched selection of books anything you want they have it it is there and

And I still get people that tweet me and say I've been listening to you talk about audible
And I've never tried it until today, and it's the best it honestly is like sometimes when you're in the car
You don't wanna
Just not in the mood to listen to music you put on your audible

Book you want to soak in you want to go back like every 10 seconds like every time I said something
You're like what okay?
I'm not going to give too much away
So again if you want to start a 30-day free trial with audible just go to audible.com slash nicole, and you're in shall
We get to the favorites
*Sigh*
its hot in here
Let's get it, lets get to the back
Alright, so let's talk about the few a little bit of makeup items that I have do I even have any makeup items in here hello hello
Alright, so the first thing. We're gonna talk about is this LC micro silk foundation
So I think you guys have seen me use this in a blog
But I will use it in my next makeup tutorial this foundation is so
Amazing I said the only downfall that I could ever find in this foundation was that I didn't try it sooner
I feel like it's hydrating on the skin. It's full coverage
It looks super luminous when you put it on your skin, and it wears really well on the skin as well
I do still things that I have oily skin even though
I think it's oiliness is kind of toning down a little bit because I do not if I have dry stuff on my skin
But that could be because of one of the parts that we're going to talk about in a second
Now that I am summertime is definitely a whole lot more oily because it's scorching
Outside okay welcome to Florida and the shade that I usually wear it in is in a warm ivory
All right next to our two lip products that we'll just quickly talk about these the first one is from milk makeup and it is
there a holographic lip
Alright, so I don't know if you guys are holo-crazy, but I'm holo-crazy anything holographic. I'm like yes
These, these I like so when I saw this I was like umm
Can I get that it is such a gorgeous,
Holographic Lipgloss but my favorite thing about this gloss, is that it's not sticky its
Super comfortable to wear on your lips. I like gloss. I don't like matte lips
I will wear matte lips obviously with a gloss on top even though. I like I'm a gloss girl
I still find some glosses to be like obnoxious to where they're super sticky not comfortable on your lips, so
Comfy and I just kind of like milk makeup in general because they're just kind of weird
And I like that about them with this then next we have silent treatment from pretty Vulgar, pretty vulgar is a newer brand at
Sephora they have a really really cool packaging. I have a couple of things that I purchased myself from them
Okay, like their lip gloss one of them. I think is like a plumping lip gloss
I don't really like that, and then I have like a mascara from them packaging to die for but I don't really like the Mascara either
But this I really like this is a matte moisturizer for your lips
I would put it on but I have a gloss on right now
But basically it is what the name says it's a matte
moisturizer for your lips because sometimes I get it not everybody wants a shiny lip especially like when you're going to bed or sometimes when
I put on like the lip balm or something
I just feel like it makes my lips like super red and intense
But this guy is really nice because you still get a lot of moisture to your lips
But you don't have super shiny lips, and they don't turn red. They just look nice and matte but moisturized
I have another milk makeup products, but I don't really use it as
Makeup I use it
For my body. This is their hydrating oil, and I look in like they're like quirky
packaging like you wouldn't think of a hydrating oil in
Like a twist up stick version like this is I personally like to use it on
My body because of the sheen it gives you like you can see that like on my arm
I love this on the legs on the arms. I don't ever use it on my face
I've never even tried it on my face. I don't know like this I
Don't know how I feel about that, but I love it like I said for all over the body. It's not oily
It's not sticky
It feels really nice it absorbs quickly into the skin and it does pack a powerful punch of hydration to the skin
Which I really like so elbows knees back of feet any random body part that needs a little extra hydration
I love this hydrating oil stick for and it smells really nice - it doesn't have like an overpowering scent
It smells like nice and clean okay
So let's talk about the part that I was kind of saying gives me a little bit of dry skin
So it says it's for revision skincare, and it a retinol complete for reduced appearance of fine Lines and wrinkles
So I got this from my med spa that I go to here in Tampa
Which is Lecada and I was having a lot of breakouts if you guys are watching my blogs
You know I was talking about like my face
Which is like non-stop breaking out, and if like discouraging when your face breaks out that much and you're in your 30s
You're like didn't I deal with this in high school and now it's kind of that
I got to do it all over again, but like ten times worse
So they recommend it this retinol for me to use and it has made such a difference in my skin
I try to use it religiously even though sometimes I slack off
And I don't my breakouts have subsided so much like I kind of get them
I'll kind of get like one when it's like that time of the month and that's expected
I'm okay with that like that's mother nature I get it, but all the time I wasn't with it
So it helped to kind of reduce my breakouts
and it helps lighten all the dark spots on my face even when I didn't have any breakouts and still have dark spots if
You are kind of acne prone like I am maybe go to a dermatologist
And have them recommend you some kind of retinoids this I'm pretty sure is only 0.5% so it's a low dosage of it
And in the beginning it was kind of drying out my skin
But I feel like my skin has kind of regulated itself to it now and if you put on like an intense
moisturizer with it
You can kind of combat that but I feel like that guy was making me a little drier in this area because this is always
Where my face would break out at and it wasn't my phone it cleaned all the time?
I wash my pillowcases drink water do all that stuff
I was just breaking out all the time
But that has helped my skin so so so much so again it's from revision skincare, and it's just a retinol complete so far
So good
This is from Caudalie and this is their vino perfect concentrated brightening essence
So if you're not familiar with in essence is the first essence that I was introduced to was from
Tatcha and it feels like water what you're supposed to do is after you've cleanse your face you apply it this
First which like it's like I said it feels like water, and it helps all your other skin care penetrate deeper into the skin
So it was using the Tatcha one, and then I'm started using this guy - this one said it was brightening
and if it says brightening
I like to use it so that's why I switched to the Caudalie one even the Tatcha one is just as good
And you just take a few drops, but I've used this I've used this so much already
and it doesn't even look like I've used any of it, but you basically just take a few drops like that and and
Just push it into your face and then continue on oh my god
I'm just flinging this essence everywhere and then continue on with whatever else you're doing in your skincare Routine
I thought that maybe it was like a step that you didn't need but I feel like after like regularly using an essence
But like I can't do my skincare routine without it now because when I wake up in the morning
I feel like my skin just looks really good plus
I've been being a little more dedicated to the skin care routine lately damn you h. I apparently just love Tatcha
This is our new Violet C Radiance Mask. Look how cute it is and it's a purple
Mask so this guy is a brightening
Mask as well, and I've used it probably like five or six times now that I've had it. It's super
Like Luxurious feeling and you put it on your face
It doesn't drive down like a charcoal mask or something like that, so it's never going to like get hard on your skin
So it always feels nice on the skin you leave it on for about 10-15 minutes
I always usually do a little bit longer and then it kind of dries like a more solid purple
And then when you wash it off, it's just so soft to wash off your face like it gets softer
And I just kind of work in as a circle
I usually only do it in this area here and never really cause forehead never really have any issues
It's good for me cheeks. They play me all the time it almost feels like a gel cream to me
It has a brightening of beautyberry + dual vitamin C
And you want to apply a generous layer of this to the skin so don't be shy girl lay it on thick
I really feel like the retinoid and the brightening cream and the brightening essence
Have really helped my skin out a lot because my dark spots. They were like No we're not going anywhere
We're hanging out. It's me and you for life
I'm here to stay and I was like no no, no you're not so that's it for me
I don't think I have anything else to tell you guys. I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
