for you yesterday but everything that
could go wrong did go wrong so I
apologize for that
I will leave a little note down below in
the description box to let you guys know
what happened yesterday so that we don't
bore anybody in this video so today's
going to be my skincare video I'm just
going to briefly be talking about the
products that I'm using and then show
you guys obviously what I do kind of
like a get unready with me the masks
that I use and stuff like that okay so
the first question of a skincare video
is what kind of skin type do I have and
I have oily skin and I don't have
sensitive skin so I don't really get any
dry patches on my face it's usually
always just oily I use oil absorbing
sheets like on a regular basis and like
I said I don't really have sensitive
skin so I can pretty much try any kind
of product and I've never really had
like a bad reaction to anything that
I've ever used so I like to think that
my skin is pretty tough it's not
sensitive at all I've never really had
acne prone skin obviously I do get
breakouts when it is that wonderful time
of the month but other than that I don't
usually get breakouts so usually all my
products that I use are from the
drugstore because one they're
inexpensive and two you don't have to
deal with counter people at the
drugstore that's the only reason that I
really don't like to buy like higher-end
skin care products is because I hate and
the people at the counters like I'm like
can I just get my toner and they want to
sell you this they want to sell you that
and like I just am someone that like
hates to be sold to like I hate when
you're putting this peel on for me I
just rather walk in not talk to anybody
get what I need and be out the door so
that's why you use a lot of drugstore
products and plus I don't like I said
don't have sensitive skin so I feel like
I can get away with it some people you
know they can't use things from the
drugstore and stuff like that but
luckily I can so like I said I've tried
tons of products and right now this is
just what's working for me it's pretty
basic it's nothing super crazy or
anything like that I just like to do an
updated skincare routine every couple of
months since it changes up and lots of
you guys ask what I'm using so getting
started the first thing that I always do
when I take my makeup off is I use some
kind of little towelettes like wet
cleansing towelettes the ones that I'm
using right now are from ponds and these
are the evening soothe which kind of
have what smell is it
chamomile and white tea I absolutely
love these I hate ones that are like
funky smelling or anything that these
just smell like you're in a spa or
something so I used this to take off all
my eye makeup and stuff like that and
I've never had an issue with these I
really like these they're kind of like a
textured towel and they don't burn my
eyes or anything like that
these don't leave any kind of burning
sensation on your eyes or anything I
never understand why they make products
that burn your eyes that are made for
your eyes it's like huh then I go in and
these will be your best friend these are
cotton rounds and these are just from
Target I usually like to get the ones
that kind of have that little exfoliator
on the other side but I grabbed these by
accident so after I get the majority of
my eye makeup off with the wet
towelettes I will take a makeup remover
and the ones that I'm obsessed with are
the Maybelline clean Express so if I
don't have any lashes on or anything
like that I will use the one that's more
the liquidy form that's got the two
different kind of liquids in it you just
shake it up like this and if I have
lashes on sometimes the lash glue lives
kind of like a gunk on my lashes I'll
use the more gel form because it just
helps get the lash gunk off a lot easier
than this then I'll take another
towelette and kind of just run it all
over my face to get any of the excess
makeup off before I go in and wash it
just to make it easier on me so that I'm
not scrubbing off so much makeup these
will take off the majority of it so then
I go on to washing my face you guys know
that I've taken a little break from my
Clarisonic but I am back to using it
just I'm using it once a week before I
was kind of using it everyday because it
just felt so good on my face and my skin
was feeling so clean and then I kind of
realized that I may have been over
exfoliating my face which was causing a
lot of breakouts but I do love the
Clarisonic I know a lot of you guys are
confused whether I loved it or hated
because I said it was breaking me out
and I was giving him I was taking a
break from it but I do love it I've just
been using it a lot more gently I do
still have the sensitive brush head on
it and I've been using the seafoam
complete face wash which is from
Pacifica and it just removes makeup
cleanses and tones and I really like
this and I don't even keep my Clarisonic
on because I think it runs for like ten
like 45 seconds almost a minute
I don't even keep it on my face for a
minute I'm kind of just like maybe 30
seconds it's on my face and then BOOM
it's off so I really really like this
seafoam face wash though it's for all
skin types and it's also soft fate free
if you look for stuff like that it's
very cleansing on your face it make sure
it's can feel very soft and it does take
everything off like that so after I've
thoroughly washed my face then cleansed
it like that the next step is to tone
your face and I've been using this toner
forever it's the Neutrogena oil-free
acne stretch control acne stress control
toner and this one just treats acne
before it emerges eliminates oil and
shine and refreshes and suits I love
this toner it is by far my favorite
toner that I've ever used it's just
refreshing when you put it on your face
it doesn't burn and the reason you need
a toner is it restores the pH balance in
your face and it also will get off any
leftover makeup that's still on your
face so that's what I do after it's
completely washed and everything like
that it's time to tone okay so after our
face has been thoroughly cleanse the
next thing we do is we moisturize
because we've just pulled all of the
moisture out of our face by washing it
and cleansing it and toning it so you
need to stick moisture back into your
face so you guys know that I was using
the josie maran argan oil I still love
it I just like to switch up my products
because there's so many out there and I
don't like to conform to just one thing
so I have been trying some of new things
and these are from L'Oreal and I
mentioned these in my favourites videos
and I am obsessed with these these are
the L'Oreal youth code line and they
just look like this I believe that
there's one other product it might be a
toner or maybe a face wash or something
but these are just the two that I have
and so after I toned my skin I go in
with the youth code texture Perfector
serum concentrate oh this stuff is
amazing it refines uneven textures pores
and fine lines this is actually for all
skin types so if you have dry skin oily
skin combination skin you can use this
and what it does it's its post to
perfect the texture of your skin over
time I honestly honestly honestly feel
that this has made such a difference in
my skin you will see my
with no makeup on it's gonna look just
like this like I may have some dark
circles or redness places but my skin
has never ever ever been as clear as it
is now and even though I've never had
like acne problems and stuff like that I
felt like I've had blackheads on my face
and my skin just just didn't look as
like smooth as I'd want it to and now
before I put my makeup on I'm just like
wow like I honestly honestly feel like
this has made such a difference in my
skin I've been using this for maybe two
months now and you can see that it's
only about down to here I put this on
before I go to sleep and when I wake up
in the morning so I swear by this I
would I seriously need everyone to go
out and buy this if you have like issues
with your skin or something I know that
I'm selling the hell out of this right
now but I just feel like it just changed
my skin so much like I said I had kind
of discoloration and little marks like
right here like where I was breaking out
and it's like almost completely gone
there's like one tiny like a little dark
mark but I feel like another month or
another month or so it'll be completely
gone so you've code texture Perfector so
then after I put that on my face I move
right on to my L'Oreal youth code
texture Perfector day and night cream
it's kind of the same idea to texture
Perfector so it's going to improve the
texture of your skin it's for all skin
types it's not greasy it's mattifying on
your skin it smells really good it's
like a pink a little cream and I do use
both of these like I said I didn't I
don't know if I did say this but I take
both of these all the way from my
forehead all the way down to like this
area here so that all this skin is even
and beautiful and line free and poor
free and tight and on point so yeah just
absolutely love these two products if
you don't want to go and get both like
you've already got a night cream or
something like that you need this in
your life I'm not even joking
you need this in yo life okay they know
if I have any kind of breakouts or
anything like that which we all hate
right I do like to use the cleaning
clear person gel
yeah person gel and just pop this on
wherever I feel like a marks gonna come
off I pay attention to my skin a lot so
I'll notice right away if I feel like a
coming out of my face and like Percy Joe
put it on there and it kind of stops it
from coming out so love that stuff and
last but not least is my benefit I cream
which just looks like this this is just
a regular this is called a it's potent
eye cream and this is just a brightening
eye cream to fade dark circles because I
do have dark circles under my eyes it's
hereditary my family I'm Italian so all
of us have dark circles under eyes I've
only been using this for like a month or
so so I've noticed a small difference in
my dark circles but nothing super
dramatic
other than that that is all that I do to
my skin it may seem like a lot to some
people it may seem like not enough to
some people but that is just what works
for me if you haven't find your perfect
skincare routine or regimen just keep
trying stuff out there if you got
sensitive skin though be careful because
my mom's got sensitive skin and she's
used some stuff before and it's totally
just messed her up so be careful with
the products that you use and just do
your research I feel like all these
products have worked really great for me
and I've just got oily skin so I hope
some of this helped you guys and I think
that's all I have to say so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and until next
time I will talk to you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
