how to get your own DIY sugar scrubs and
I'm also going to show you how to keep
those lips nice and moisturize so a few
things you're going to need is either
brown sugar or regular sugar I'm going
to be using a little bit of honey we're
also going to be using some coconut oil
because it's a great moisturizer and
it's super inexpensive and you can use
this for seriously everything I'm using
a little cinnamon for taste and a little
virgin olive oil for its great
antioxidant properties so the first one
I'm going to make is a cinnamon sugar
scrub I'm just going to use my regular
old sugar and I have these little
containers because you could make them
in these sizes if you wanted to give
them away as a gift for the holidays so
I'm just going to pour about half the
jar full of sugar I'm just using it to
measure and then we're going to pour
everything into this bowl and then I'm
going to add a scoop of coconut oil I'm
just kind of eyeballing everything I
want to just make enough so that it will
fit nicely in the jar and then because
this is my cinnamon sugar 1 which is my
favorite I'm just going to add a little
bit of ground sugar and this is all up
to you you can add as much or as little
as you like and then we're just going to
mix everything together
oops I cannot forget my extra-virgin
olive oil this is a great natural
antioxidant and it also helps to protect
your lips from damage and then of course
you just want to combine all the
ingredients but just be careful not to
over mix because if you do you will
actually dissolve all the sugar and then
you won't even feel it in your lip scrub
so just be careful and then I'm just
going to pop it into these cute little
jars that I found at Michaels I thought
they were perfect they were like a buck
so I was like yep let me get these and
then you just want to make sure it's
sealed tightly and then you can store it
in the fridge for up to two weeks just
make sure to pull it out about five
minutes beforehand so that it gives it a
chance to solve it so moving on to my
dry pink lip scrub this one isn't going
to be as buttery or as milky as the
first lip scrub so again I'm just
measuring it out in my little container
and I'm squeezing in some honey pouring
in a little bit of evo o and then some
food coloring for the pinkness it just
kind of shot out at me like Hello
it scared me what it did it and then
just a tiny scoop of coconut oil and
then I'm just going to combined
everything you can use any kind of food
coloring that you want you could add a
flavor in here like a raspberry or
anything like that I just like this one
because it's fun and girly and sometimes
I don't like a lip scrub that is so like
creamy I don't know how to describe it
but I always pinch it to make sure it's
just boys rising enough and then I just
pop this little bad boy into his jar as
well
and then last but not least is the brown
sugar honey scrub brown sugar is a
little more tricky so I just pop my
little guy in there and scoop in the
brown sugar and again I'm just measuring
it out to about half the container maybe
a little more for the brown sugar that's
how much I use and I'm just going to
pour it in I'm gonna add a little bit of
coconut oil because again is a great
moisturizer and this is organic coconut
oil it is a solid at first but it does
turn into a liquid once it kind of gets
heated up and warmed up if you don't
know about coconut oil google it like
its amazingness and then of course I'm
just going to add some honey to this and
then all you want to do is combine the
ingredients I'm kind of using a twisting
turning motion with my spoon just
because again I don't want to dissolve
all the sugar and brown sugar is great
because it is less harsh than regular or
cane sugar so if you have more sensitive
lips this would be great for you
you
and then if you want to give these away
as gifts you could jazz them up by just
adding a little ribbon to each of them
these ribbons are like a buck at
Michael's super super cheap and there's
my cash always I found these labels also
in my scrapbooking section ish but you
could just write on the jar if you
didn't have these little labels and then
I'm just gonna write what they are a
cinnamon scrub a lip scrub and a brown
sugar scrub and now it's time to scrub
my lips so of course I'm going to grab
him out of the fridge I like them cold
anyways I just think they're better they
feel better on your lips and then when
we're gonna go into the bathroom we're
gonna speed through my messy room look
how nasty nose hello hello and then
we're going to scrub these bad boys so
the first thing I do is obviously take
off any lipstick that I may have on
then you want to dunk your finger in I
mean it's pretty self-explanatory but I
personally just like to layer it on my
lip and not really exfoliate with my
fingers I just like to get a nice decent
layer of lip scrub on my lips
and then using a baby toothbrush because
these are super super soft I find that
regular toothbrushes are just a little
too harsh on my lips I'm just going to
gently exfoliate with that and the lip
scrub and this is the perfect
combination for me it gets off any dry
skin and may have on my lips and I kind
of keep going back over with my fingers
just making sure I don't feel any loose
skin if I do I kind of just add a little
more sugar scrub and scrub everything
till there's nothing else there and then
I'm just going it to a wipe the sugar
scrub off and I like to apply a little
bit of water on my lips just to make
sure they're not sticky just going it to
Pat them off and then finish it off with
a Vaseline any kind of lip butter or
salad or anything like that just for
added moisture so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I hope you guys make
some they're great for the winter months
if you have dry chapped lips try them
out and don't forget to put your lip
scrub back in the fridge after you're
done using it so I love you guys until
next time I'll have a new video for you
tomorrow - yes haha I'll talk to you
guys soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
