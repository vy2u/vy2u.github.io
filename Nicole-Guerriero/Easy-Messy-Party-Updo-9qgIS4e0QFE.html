tutorial for you it's kind of a messy
holiday party updo lots of you guys have
asked for an updo I guess you guys like
wearing them me I'm more of a hair down
kinda gal but I did I used to do my hair
like this all the time I'm pretty sure I
have a really old tutorial like this
from when I first started making videos
but I wanted to redo it the one that I
think is my other one I have like a side
part and it's just kind of like a flat
hair look I'm so I give this one a
little tease to just kind of pump it up
a little bit and then it's really really
easy
the most tedious part of this whole hair
tutorial look is curling your hair with
a small curling iron and the one that I
use for this video is from baby list pro
from Flatiron experts and it is a 3/4
inch barrel you can use anything from
like a 3/4 inch to a one-inch I wouldn't
recommend going higher than a one-inch
for this look because you want your
curls to kind of be pretty tight so that
you can pin them up easily in the back
you're going to need lots and lots of
bobby pins for this I had to search all
over my entire house because I don't
know if it's just me but I swear my
bobby pins have legs and they get up and
just walk away because any time I'm like
alright I got to do a hair tutorial on
any bobby pins that's like scour my
whole house for bobby pins but hopefully
you won't have that issues you guys want
to see how to get it then just keep
watching the video and one more side
note if you've noticed the window
opening I'm kneading this kind of light
to come in because I broke one of my
ring lights well I didn't break it I
think when my cats did so that's why I
hadn't had videos up for the past couple
days because I've been having lighting
issues I tried to film the other day and
the one light of the other light that I
do have was just so bright I couldn't
even see what I was doing in the mirror
I couldn't tell what the colors or
anything like that so please just bear
with me while I find a new lighting
situation and yeah I think that's all I
want to say I'm totally rambling right
so if you guys want to see how to get
this easy messy updo then just keep
watching the video thanks guys
buddy so getting started you can start
with any kind of hair you want this is
kind of a three day old hair that's been
curled a couple of times so you can work
with straight hair or whatever kind of
hair that you've got going so all we're
gonna do is we're going to section I'm
just gonna brush through
make sure there's no knots or anything
I'm just gonna really quickly spray it
with some cake you see thermal shines
right and I have a little creek behind
me the curling iron that I'm working
with today is the fabulous Pro this is a
3/4 inch curling iron a wand you can use
for this but I'm choosing to use a clamp
curling iron I'm going to lift the clamp
and wrap the hair inside and then close
the crimp clamp to me that gives me a
more even kind of wave curl that I'm
going for but if you want to just wrap
it right around your wand that's
perfectly fine as well
you
Oh
okay should be heat up by now and we're
working in pretty small sections so
anything about this big maybe a little
bigger maybe a little smaller personal
preference we're gonna take our curling
iron curling wand whatever you're using
I'm gonna buy behind my head cause it's
a little bit easier and then we're just
going to curl these small pieces close
the clamp now because we're working with
such small pieces of hair you don't
really have to leave it on for a really
long time it is make sure cuz I just
trying to iron it on and just let it
fall and then you're gonna have a curl
that's pretty curly and bouncy like that
which is what we want for the updo that
we're trying to achieve
you can curl them towards your face or
away from your face I'm kind of just
alternating close the clamp on them
and let it fall we can hold it there for
probably five to ten seconds if you hold
it less you'll get kind of more of like
a car like this but I want them to be
kind of super super curly so I'm gonna
hold mine a little bit longer we want to
just let it rest for a second it'll be
even curlier so we're just going to
repeat this whole thing all over entire
head and then once our whole head is
curled I will show you guys how to do
the most important part and just put
your hair up
what you first need to do is I like you
can change your part you can have a side
part with this or you can do down the
middle I'm gonna do down the middle
because that's the part that I usually
have so I'm just going to brush some of
it back because we're gonna do a little
teasin just determine where you want
volume
the hairspray the little just so that
it'll kind of stay where we put it
and then you want to kind of start
brushing this part back just spreading
it to help you then you're gonna take
just a hair tie
keep these front pieces out you're gonna
take your hair and you're gonna pull it
into kind of a loose ponytail like this
and then just lightly tie it and pull it
out and then for the rest of it we're
just gonna need a bunch of bobby pins as
always and what I'm going to start doing
is just grabbing pieces of our hair and
kind of pushing it up and then pinning
it so you're just taking some hair
pinning it upwards
I'm kind of like flipping the hair and
like turning it to kind of push it up
see like kind of twisting it like that
opinion
so if you didn't want to pin all of it
up you could totally go with something
like this this is just a little bit of
the hair left over that hasn't been all
the way pinned up and it would look
really cute this way - more like a side
pony but then you had like this nice
messy like you didn't try too hard kind
of hair
kind of twisting it around my finger and
then pushing it up and then you just
want to pull some like smaller hairs
down like around your face carefully of
course and I just keep pulling at it you
know I like messy hair and just finish
off with some hairspray you can kind of
lock these front pieces together if you
roll them like with your fingers so that
they're not separated curls it's like
one big curls and then you can recrawl
these pieces if you want them to be more
curly but I actually like how they look
kind of like wavy straight curly so I'll
show you guys the back other than that
our holiday updo party whatever you want
to call it look is complete so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and until
next time I will talk to you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
