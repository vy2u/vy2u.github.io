background off and wear it no I'm just
kidding looks like wearing my silver
background I don't have anything to
write on it with yeah there's only like
nine days till Christmas and then this
year is like over over so the first
thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna prep my
skin using the Marc Jacobs I never
remember the name this is the invisible
undercover perfecting a coconut a face
primer that is a lot to say I think I've
told you guys this before I do really
like this I like how it makes the skin
look and feel it feels really nice on
the skin and full of so then after I
moisturize my face I like to go in with
some kind of pore primer kind of a pore
refiner to diminish the look of any
pores on my face so I've been loving the
dr. Brandt no more pores I'm totally
into this one I don't know what it is
about it it's super thin and it's like
the color of skin but it just like melts
into your face and totally just makes
all the pores on my face just disappear
it's a really lightweight - like it's
not heavy or thick like some primers are
doesn't have like that silicone feel to
it but it really just makes them all go
away it's crazy I was doing Christmas
shopping yesterday the mall is already
insane you know they got the signs up
lock your doors
oh nothing says holiday is like these
big signs that say lock your doors look
what I found in the bottom of my
suitcase all the way to the bottom of my
suitcase was my lip mask I'm so excited
can't live without it like I tried to
use other I tried to use other things to
prep my lips with and it's just not the
same like this other stuff I feel like
dry is on my lips like before I'm done
doing my makeup and this doesn't there's
nothing like you so for a foundation
today I'm gonna use I think just L'Oreal
True Match you guys know I'm obsessed
with L'Oreal True Match to me it's one
of the best foundations in the whole
world so I just like to give it a shake
first I'm using the color n3 I'm just
going to dot this all over my face and
then I'm going to use my artist oval 7
brush to apply
to the skin this brush is magical too I
don't know what it is
I really haven't used my beauty blender
to put on my foundation since I got this
brush and I can see my Beauty Blender
evil eye on me right now like I still
love you I still appreciate you Beauty
Blender I gotta get used to though
putting like less foundation on because
I'm used to the Beauty Blender how
attractive is this I'm used to the
Beauty Blender but I don't know I like
full coverage so it's never enough
is it still weird to put it on like this
absolutely and it's a little tricky
around the mouth I notice well for muse
somebody loved my brows is my favorite
brow pencil ever the CEO Nastasia number
seven brush and I'm gonna use just brow
powders today to fill in my brows so I
was looking at the weather from Florida
just to see like what Christmas would be
it's gonna be like 82 on Christmas Day
okay next for the lid I'm just gonna
take umm this is just a clean brush
there's nothing on here I'm just gonna
go around to make sure the foundation
cuz I do have foundation over my lids as
well just gonna make sure it's all
blended out so it's not like creasing on
eyelids cuz we're not gonna do a lot on
the lid today because I want to do like
a green sparkly liner so I don't have a
green eyeliner so I'm gonna use the
jeffree star velour liquid lip in the
color mistletoe and just a small like
eyeliner brush this is a Sigma 0 5 and
then I'm gonna add some glitter to it
now I couldn't find any green cosmetic
grade glitter in my room so I'm gonna
use just really fine milled glitter be
very careful if you're just gonna use
glitter on your eyes because it can get
into your eye it can cut your eye I
personally can use it on myself I
haven't had any issues with it but I
just want to warn you guys if you do use
glitter on your eyes to be vanity then
be careful so I'm gonna do a little bit
of mascara because it just helps me to
get my wing rate I'm gonna curl my
lashes first though just a little bit
just just a tad bit of mascara and then
we're gonna go in with our mistletoe
give it a little shake get everything
together and then I'm just gonna pull
products right off the tip of the brush
cuz there seems to be a nice bit of
product just resting there get this on
our eyeliner brush and then I'm gonna do
like a winged liner fingers crossed I'm
not really good with like brush liner
situations
yep okay let's go ahead and go to the
problem child I two different eyeballs
this one likes to hang down way lower
and then when the scary part comes in is
when you try to imply nerds even and
then you know shake it's crazy but I
think we're pretty good on the liner go
Jeffrey star okay so once our green
minor is on I'm going to add a little
bit of glitter
now the glitter that I'm gonna use like
I said is from the craft store so if
you're going to use a glitter from the
craft store try to find one that is
super super fine like super milled so
I'm gonna use this green right here I
have tons of these they're just like in
my Halloween box but these are from
Michael's I use these all the time as
like glitter from my eyes but like I
said you want to find something that's
small like this you don't really want to
use something that's like larger like
this guy is you can see how fine this is
if you can find cosmetic grater look if
you can find a cosmetic grade glitter
that's gonna be a lot better but I
couldn't find a green glitter in my
collection of makeup to save my life I
found every color but green but like I
said I have used these before and they
do meet they do me justice so I'm just
going to go ahead and go with um this
green guy here but just one more time
just please be very careful if you're
gonna use glitter on your eyeballs so
I'm just gonna try to go in and see if
we can uh if it'll just stick to this
right here Oh yep I'm just pushing it
right in to the mistletoe
so then before you move on just sweep
any excess glitter like away from your
eye so it doesn't you know find its way
in there
and now we have green glitter so for
lashes I'm going to use these from house
of lashes these are the boudoir lashes
they're kind of a little dramatic
they're a little fuller in the middle
than they are on the ends and the outer
corners so now we can move on to
concealing and doing the rest of our
face so I'm gonna go ahead and conceal
I'm gonna use the NYX HD concealer this
is in the color light CW oh three
I really like this color it has like a
little bit of a an orange e tone to it
which I really like and just by pulling
it a little higher up onto your nose
it'll give the appearance of like having
a slimmer nose without having to contour
your nose and then I'm just using this
motives brush it never had a name on it
I don't think but it's one of like my
favorites for underneath the eyes but
I've talked to you guys before like Mac
makes l-159 which is great for doing the
same thing and we're just gonna push
this into the skin
and then to set underneath our eyes I'm
going to use the laura mercier secret
brightening powder to set my foundation
you know I like to use Studio Fix just
because it's either all or nothing so
we're going full coverage we're going
full coverage all the way just a powder
foundation so it's gonna add a little
bit more coverage to your face so you
can get away with wearing like a little
bit less foundation if you are gonna set
with this I put on my normal amount of
foundation because I just love it this
is an NW 25 and then I just used this
brush from Sephora this is a pro
airbrush but I really like this brush
because it will give me a nice amount of
coverage but it doesn't pack it on so
it's like super super heavy you know
what I mean so just grab some product
and then I just push it into the skin so
now I'm gonna do a little bit of
bronzing this is just a bunch of
anastacio like bronzing powders and then
these are like some cream contour colors
that I had from I don't know something
but these are all uh Nastasia colors up
top I'm not sure what the names are that
I'm gonna use but I'll have them listed
in the bottom bar for you guys but I'm
gonna mix like this guy and then this
like more great home guy here and as you
see like I'm putting the contour down
and then I'm like going upwards so you
want to keep everything above this you
don't want to like drag it down it's
kind of hard to contour in this light
though because I can't see the shadows
on my face cuz it's just blended so
we're gonna go with this blush right
here which is make you mine I just like
to do a little blush at first before we
do our lip and then you know you can
decide if you need more well now I have
to make these faces
again you guys usually ask what brush
this is this is just a duo-fiber f50
from sigma i call it a stippling brush
but it just helps to blend and like melt
everything together there's nothing on
windows it just itches like a maniac so
I've talked about these girl lactic like
highlights before this is a new one from
them it is any color lustre so I haven't
used it yet so I wanted to try it today
if I can find my highlight brush
so again it was called luster I they
have a really nice natural face glow
which is beautiful and then I have like
this bronzy glow which I love all those
powders from girl lactic but this honey
I'm gonna do a little bit of mascara on
our lashes just you know bring these
babies to life and get rid of any
glitter that might be lingering and then
I'm not gonna do anything on the bottom
lash line today we're just gonna do
mascara so you can go ahead and add
mascara to the lower lash line as well
and then for lips we're gonna do a red
lip since it's holly jolly Christmas
time and I had three red lips here um I
wasn't sure what color I was gonna go
with but I think I'm gonna go with
honest osseous candy-apple just cuz it's
like a nice bright red it's got a little
bit of a glitter to it so we're gonna do
that
first I'm gonna line my lips with cherry
from Mac because you know I gotta line
my lips I don't know why but I got to do
it otherwise I'll have liquid lipstick
like up to my nostrils and then we can
just fill it in with the candy apple
now I am feeling festive are my lips a
little too orange you should be more red
I'm gonna add a little bit of ho ho ho
from Geoffrey star just to kind of make
it a little more right cuz it feels a
little orange so this is the final look
for my festive Christmas glam I hope you
guys enjoyed this video
totally hands-down my favorite part is
the glitter liner now if you don't have
green you can probably use white and
then some kind of green glitter on top
of that and I'll give you like the same
effect because I feel like that green
was nice to use but it really didn't pop
that green is like with the green
glitter on top of it and remember if
you're using glitter to be very very
careful around your eye area
I didn't get any glitter in my eye I
don't have five for me that highlight
though galactic you know what you're
doing so that is it for this video I
don't think I have anything else to tell
you guys except I love you thank you so
much for watching and until next time I
will talk to you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
