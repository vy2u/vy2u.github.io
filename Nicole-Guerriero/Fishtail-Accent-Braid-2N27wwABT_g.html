today I did this hair tutorial
ever since I posted my last braid a lot
of you wanted to see more braided hair
tutorials and braided hair tutorials are
actually my favorite thing to do I'm
trying to think of more ways to
incorporate cute braids for the
summertime it's really easy it's just
kind of a side fishtail braid right here
for a little accent and then loose messy
kind of curls fishtail braids are really
easy I know they look like the most
complicated but they are super super
easy so hopefully I can show you guys
how to do it and you will understand and
pick it up you know me I like super
super messy hair so if you don't want
yours this messy then you don't have to
do the major teasing that I do in the
video but I like messy hair especially
with braids I just feel like it's really
boho and really cute I do have the side
pin right now but in the video I do show
you both ways I just did this last
minute because I felt like it evened out
better with the braids being right here
I don't think I have anything else to
say
so if you guys want to see how to get
this cute side fishtail braid then just
keep watching the video thanks guys hey
hey hey
alright to get started we're going to
work with any kind of hair we have I'm
just working with this straight hair for
now so I'm just going to brush through
to make sure my hair is not free and I
already have clipped in my Bellamy hair
extensions in Lilly hair so I'm just
going to spray a little bit of shaping
hairspray to make sure that my braid
stays nice and secure and give it a nice
brush through again then we're going to
section off a large chunk of hair from
the top section if you're wearing hair
extensions make sure that you're not
grabbing too much hair and exposing
anything
working with our top section we're gonna
want to make sure there's no knots in it
so just give it a finger comb and then
you're gonna want to split this one
section into two sections like so pretty
easy so far right then you're just going
to want to grab a piece of hair from the
front section and combine it with the
back section of hair I know it sounds
confusing to say but if you just watch
this tutorial and just practice one time
I guarantee you will have it it's really
really easy so to keep going we're gonna
grab a piece from our back section of
hair and we're going to pull it over and
join it with our front section I'm a
little slow and kind of awkward in the
beginning stages of my fishtail braids
but it gets a lot easier as you move
down so if you're struggling struggling
a little bit don't worry you're not
alone
I struggle too but if you just keep
going it gets a lot easier and yeah it
gets a lot easier so this is just a very
repetitive hairstyle you're just going
to keep alternating grabbing pieces from
the front and adding them to the back
section of hair and so on you're going
to grab pieces from the back section and
you're going to pull them over and add
them to the front section I'm just going
to let you guys watch now because it's
super super easy and I promise just
practice with me while I'm speeding
through the process and I bet you'll
have it by the end of the video
you can stop your braids wherever you
like but I like to stop - Jeff so that I
can curl the bottom piece grab an
elastic but before we put it in I'm just
going to stretch out our braid making it
look a little more voluminous kind of
the same thing we did in my other braid
tutorial I just like to do this to any
braid that I'm wearing even if it's just
a regular braid I just like to make it
more fluffy and full and yeah you know
what I'm talking about
then go ahead and secure your brave with
a clear elastic or a dark one whatever
you got will work for me girl and then
I'm just going to fluff it up even more
to just get a little more volume up in
there and now it's time for curling I'm
going to use my in Belem III and one one
and I think this is a 25 millimeter one
I'm not even positive but I'm pretty
sure and I'm just going to loosely curl
my hair you can do this with a
straightener you can do it with a bigger
size curling wand whatever your little
heart desires or you could probably
leave your hair straight but I just
wanted to give it a little texture
because we're going into be teasing it
and making it a little messy
so after you have all your hair curled
I'm just going to take a wide tooth comb
this is actually a teasing comb but you
can use whatever kind of comb you have
you can even do this with a brush and
I'm just going to tease my hair a little
bit by pushing it up as you can see and
again if you don't like messy hair you
can totally skip this part but I don't
know I just like messy hair I can't help
myself
so after we're done I'm just going to
take a paddle brush and kind of smooth
everything out so it's just not so messy
and in your face because I know some
people don't like that but hey I do and
then I'm just going to give it a light
spray and after that this look is pretty
much complete if you're going to leave
it down so here you go just have your
little cute accent fishtail braid yeah
girl work but then I was looking at
myself in the mirror and I was like you
know what I could pin the side back and
it would work so I was i okay
let's try it so all I did was a grab
three sticky bobby pins and pin my hair
back and I made sure to get that last
bobby pin in there tight cuz it was
giving me a little extra volume in there
so yeah once that is secure this look is
completely done so I hope you guys
enjoyed leave me more ideas for braided
tutorials cuz they're my fav and yeah I
love you guys thanks for watching and
until next time I will talk to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
