so I have a birthday party to go to in a
couple of hours and I figured I would
just start getting ready now do my hair
and my makeup and I figured I'll just
get ready with you guys I'm not really
sure how I'm going to do my hair or my
makeup today I am gonna be trying out
some new extensions today though they're
the Bellamy Bugatti I feel funny saying
Bugatti who got it
but like 340 grams of hair something
crazy and it comes with like a
volumizing whoof which I'll show you
guys towards the end of the video when I
start doing my hair but I'm not really
sure how I'm gonna do my makeup like at
all I don't know what I want to do like
I want to go full glam do I want to go
like semi glam don't go like matchy
matchy glam clearly we're gonna just go
glam that's crazy how the word glam just
kind of took over the world right I'm so
thirsty
sure and you guys you saw me put my
messy bun up that's how I usually do it
I'll just throw it on top of my head so
I'm just going to moisturize my skin
with the cling meet with the Clinique
with the Clinique dramatically different
moisturizing gel I love this stuff I've
been switching on and off between this
and the Bobbi Brown vitamin enriched
face base pictures whatever I feel like
at the time but these two are my
favorite then I'm going to prep my lips
with my best dammit lip masks if you
haven't tried it try it especially if
you wear any kind of liquid lipsticks or
matte lipsticks it just makes them more
comfortable and a lot of you will ask
what I have on my lips and I have
nothing on I just have this on my
crystal it masks I feel like it makes
sure let's look cute I have no paper
towels in here Oh like we eat the bun in
the shop so my camera wasn't filming I
wasn't paying attention to the monitor
and I didn't even notice that the record
wasn't on so I already have my
foundation on
I want to do a first impression I was
I'm just going to tell you guys what I
was telling you a second ago but I want
to do a first impression on this 24 hour
makeup from Lancome that I mentioned in
a haul but I don't want to wear it
tonight because I don't know if I'm
gonna like it or not so I want to go
with something that I know that I like
so I mix these two foundations together
which is the Ultra HD and the aqua
foundation from Co Gendo this is in 143
this is in 155 they're not really a
difference in color like this one maybe
a little lighter than this one but I
just like the consistency together that
it gives so I just jotted that all over
my face I mix it together on the back of
my hand and then taught it all of my
face and then pounce it out with a
Beauty Blender I like to get the excess
off the lids what I was saying is that I
used to pounce my makeup on really fast
but you better like 2-digit addicted it
but I've noticed that if I want a better
coverage to take my time and like barely
press against my face like I'm really
barely touching my face with the Beauty
Blender just to get a nice full coverage
look we're going to move on to brows I'm
going to use brow powder from Anastacio
this is just a probe brow palette like
it has all the colors in it but I mainly
just use the soft brown and the Auburn
sometimes I'll go in with a little bit
of chocolate like to line the underneath
um the soft brown colors I mainly focus
on the front and then the darker colors
I focus more on the back so I'm going to
pick up a little bit of Auburn Auburn
Auburn and this is like my favorite
eyebrow brush this is a Nastasia number
7 brush it's just so thin it's like
perfect so
like why can't I have this brow like
hair grow up there grow up there hair
just a little music I'm just gonna take
this like bone shade from the Carli
bybel palette it's become like one I'm
just like my favorite just like all over
colors so I'm just gonna lay this down
first because I think I need black
eyeshadow today I don't I don't know
what I'm doing but he's black so then
I'm gonna use the Omri Z palette again
because it's just sitting here next to
me and has a black shade in it I'm
trying to find a brush but I can't find
the brush that I want oh here's one
okay I see you I'm gonna use this brush
from Mac I'm gonna share it to 242 which
is like a flat brush like this which is
great for like packing on color and I'm
going to go in with LBD and I'm gonna
pick some of this up on the brush kind
of a lot tap all the excess off and then
we're going to work it right on the
corner of our eye well we're going to
try to stay on this side and then we're
going to buff out the color using a
brush like this this is actually from
Sedona lace this is an e b09
say what makes these brushes Mac makes
these brushes morphe makes new brushes
everybody makes these brushes you cannot
live your makeup life without these
brushes or this one
like to do little circular walkins here
back and forth
I'm gonna draw it I'm going to get this
little tiny blending brush from Sigma
this is an e36 there's no product on it
okay so I'm going to leave the eyes
alone well I believe the eyeshadow alone
for now as I pick up the brush and start
winning some more right but we got to
keep it moving because I told you guys
before I usually like how I shadow looks
until like lashes are on because then
you can see how it's going to look like
more how you're going to wear it like
I'm not gonna find it look like this hmm
I'm going to put a little bit of mascara
on I'm not going to do liner because we
just have black eyeshadow on and I want
this part to stay open so I'm just using
the l'oreal voluminous the lashes i'm
gonna wear today are we show you a nice
a nice path not the fact that i'm using
i'm going to use these 614 lashes from
salon perfect
I love these lashes from salon perfect I
actually love the six 15s more but I
can't find 6:15 anywhere I don't know if
they're hiding from me I don't know
what's going on so on perfect if you're
watching please put six 15s everywhere
but these six for teens are just as bomb
I love these six for teams that lash
glue will disappear and we'll put a
little bit more black eyeshadow over
there because that's a lot of lash glue
right there
so I'm going to leave the eyes alone for
a second to let that lash glue dry we're
gonna go ahead and move on to concealing
I'm first going to do a little color
correction underneath the eyes did a
whole video on
this so I will link it in the bottom bar
but I'm going to use the NYX dark circle
corrector this is in the medium shade
it's an orange tinted concealer to kind
of combat the blueness underneath my
eyes so all you want to do if you do
color correct before you put your
concealer on is you only want to put it
in the area that's needed so it's only
in the darkest areas so I'm using this
morphe brush and I'm just pushing it
right into this area can see the
difference already from this eye to this
eye
why not I'm gonna conceal and I'm gonna
use the NARS radiant creamy concealer
because I haven't used this guy in a
really long time and I saw him sit in my
drawer and I was like oh
and if you take it up higher like on
your nose I care because I don't really
contour my nose because I don't really
have time for that it just takes too
long but if you bring it up on the sides
of your nose here it'll kind of give you
the appearance of having a slimmer nose
then I'm going to tap this out with this
motives brush pushing the product like
into my skin
I'm going to bake underneath my eyes I
know a lot of people think that baking
is like a gimmick or whatnot but if you
have trouble with creasing underneath
your eyes you should really just bake
that part that's the only part of my
face that I bake I'm using the Ben Nye
Cameo powder and I'm just putting some
in my hand like this and then I use the
Beauty Blender first I'm going to just
tap out to make sure there's no creasing
under there because if you have creasing
and you put powder there you're just
walking the creases in pop it into
powder and then that there we go this
will help keep the area bright and then
we're just gonna let that sit there cook
under there bake under there set under
there whatever you want to call it it's
going to help a lot with cruising I got
it all in my lashes though huh I'm going
to set my whole face with powder if I
can find it and I'm going to use NC 30
 this is energy 20 we do not want
that we want NC 35
I think I'm going to use this blush
again this blush is called stubborn I
think it's a pro longwear blush from Mac
light pressure give it to the apples so
then we can wipe away our baked egde and
then we can blend this out a little more
before we do like our highlight or
anything and this is a duo fiber brush
so I'm just going to come through and
sweep it off
highlights right up in this area and
then I like to do my nose first ideally
and take our duo fiber brush light
pressure and then just kind of blend
that together so
the only thing I had left to do I mean I
stopped into this whole head of hair but
um we just have to do our lip so this is
the look Oh Leslie finished makeup
I actually really like how it turned out
especially because I sat down not
knowing what I wanted to do I love this
lip color it has trust issues from
Anastacio and yeah so now we're going to
go ahead and move on to the hair it's
gonna be like a 90 minute video I feel
like so there's two packs in here
there's the 220 grams set I wear number
4 chocolate brown and then this is the
Bugatti one 20 22 inch to the piece that
I'm excited to see just like the
volumizing piece this is so thick this
would be great just to use like one
piece if you want it this would be great
for like ponytails and stuff like that
because it's just one nice big piece it
looks so shiny - doesn't it look at this
thing it's like so much hair it's like
one like they're 120 grams set I feel
like they just sewed it all into this
guy right here shake him out so much
hair you guys and we're going to flip
him back here dang it's not that heavy
either I thought it was going to be um
heavier but it's really not I'm
definitely gonna go get this hair
layered because it's so much
talking up a storm
becoming wind-ups trainings we need some
really nice things we need some really
big rings I got a really big so that is
it for this video this is he finished
hair and makeup my hair didn't curl as
much as I wanted to but that's because
like I said I could only find this dry
Norma's curling iron so I'll probably
curl it a little more later but for now
it's good or maybe I'll just leave it as
is but it is so much hair again is there
the Bellamy Bugattis I don't even have
all the hair clipped in it's just so
much hair I don't think I have anything
else to tell you guys except I love you
thank you so much for watching and until
next time I'll all time together
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
