going to be hopefully a hair and makeup
tutorial I kind of have this vision in
my head of these like pigtail stacked
braids so hopefully I can achieve that
look otherwise this is just gonna be a
makeup tutorial so today's look is going
to be a glittery and glassy look I want
to do like glittery eyes glossy lips
maybe glossy cheeks you know we like it
glossy um so let's go ahead and jump
into the video um as you can see my face
is way whiter than the rest of my body
hashtag spray tan life so when you first
see me applying my foundation you might
think it's a little too dark and you're
like what the hell is she doing but I
have to match it to the rest of my body
if you spray tan you know about this if
you don't you probably like what is she
doing because I spray tan my body stays
tan because I wash my face every single
night my face obviously gets really
white super quick probably the second
day probably the first day I have a
spray tan on so yeah don't be alarmed
when you see my dark foundation so I'm
just gonna pin my hair back real quick
and I will be using hair extensions for
the braid
clearly I'm not gonna do a little short
mini braids so I've already moisturized
my face so we're just gonna move on to
primer I am back to using the makeup
forever skin equalizer after leaving it
for a little bit and using dr. pores no
more
no dr. pores after using the dr. Brandt
no more pores for a while I went back to
this and discovered that I think this
one is actually way better than the
other one I don't know I think at first
when you like try a new like pore
minimizer I think that they're all like
oh but then you start using them for a
while and you're like I just think I
don't know something about this one and
then of course we're gonna do a little
bit of lip mask keep these lips nice and
moisturized if you guys hear like any
background noise like birds or anything
up my doors open because Manny is
hanging out on the balcony this is the
Clinique beyond perfecting foundation
and it is in the color 8 which is golden
neutral and then we're just going to I
just like to dot it all over my face
with the applicator don't try to put
your foundation on with this applicator
it just will not work I can understand
how like if you aren't like a makeup
where and then you watch like a makeup
video of people that are makeup where's
your probably like holy Sh I'm not I'm
not doing all that but it'd be kind of
once you like get into makeup it kind of
just becomes like second nature and you
don't think this is a lot of makeup so
I'm just going to take my Beauty Blender
and we're gonna pounce this into the
skin some people are like fast and
furious with our Beauty Blender but I'll
use really light pressure when I use my
Beauty Blender like I'm barely pushing
into the skin just enough to get it
blended I like number eight now where
it's a good color it doesn't really have
like a pink tinge to it like six does or
6.5 keep calling it six but it's six
point five make sure you drag it down
underneath your neck you know uh-huh
just to make sure everything's blending
well I had to go to the dentist on
Thursday emergency dentist appointment
so I kind of been like on pain
medication for the past two days so I
tried to film yesterday and I looked at
the footage and I felt like I looked
like oh like a loopy and um so back
today I didn't take it this morning
because I want it to be able to film
today because I knew I was going to the
dentist tomorrow shoo I just put a
little bit of like numbing cream like on
my tooth get me through this video the
ones it's all blended I'll just go over
it like with big bounces of the Beauty
Blender just to pick up any excess
product that's on the skin so I always
feel like my color is a little off at
first just cuz I spray tan like I said
and I'm usually just always fifty shades
of tan or pale but by the end of the
video when we put like our concealer and
our powder and a bronze aren't
everything it just kind of works its way
into being a color that kind of works
for you so I'm going to go ahead and
move on and do my brows you know
hmm I've to get a root canal on my top
tooth tomorrow like my top for this back
tooth I'm like how the hell is that
gonna work out I'm gonna like turn me
upside down and like get in there like
I've never had a root canal on my top to
just like want to get like all my teeth
like ripped out just get veneer so I
don't have to like worry about a
toothache ever again when there's only
three things on your work space but you
can't even find what you're looking for
so who still thinks Jon Snow is alive so
moving on to the eyes they're going to
be super duper easy we're going to use
the ideal duo from dose of colors and
this is a pigment and loose primer oh
it's a loose pigment in primer in one
and we're going to use the color shale
but I'm not going to use the primer with
it I'm only going to use the pigment so
it comes with a coordinating pigment
right no so it comes with a coordinating
primer that you can put on your lid and
then put the pigment on top of it but
I'm just going to use the pigment itself
because I kind of like how the pigment
this color in general shell looks on its
own so I'm just gonna get a flat brush
and since I already have kind of
foundation concealer on my lids it's
gonna have a nice little base to stick
to so I'm just going to pick this up on
a brush and then we're going to push
this right onto our lid you want to make
sure you're pushing it onto your lid
instead of like sweeping it onto your
lids so that you're not getting a lot of
the sparkles falling out onto your face
because we already have our foundation
on if you don't have your foundation on
already then you can you know basically
do whatever you want cuz you're not
going to message it pick up so you can
just keep pushing it on until you kind
of build it up to your liking I'm only
doing it like right on my lid kind of
trying to stay away from the crease
because since my lids kind of fold on
top of each other it'll just make it
wait it'll just make its way up there at
some point so try to keep it away from
there for as long as I can so that is it
for our eyes if you want to add a little
bit of crease color be my guest so then
next we're just going it to curl our
natural lashes oh and then add a little
bit of mascara so moving on to lashes
since this look is pretty neutral and
toned down
I'm gonna amp it up a little bit with
our lash and I'm gonna wear these lashes
from the lure I don't have the box for
them because these are my second time
wearing them but this is the lash which
you probably can barely see I'll just
put a picture here of what they are
these are the fluff and cool lashes so
these are faux silk lashes and you can
wear these like a bunch of time so like
I said because the look is kind of
natural I'm going to amp it up with a
fuller lash and I really like these
lashes because even though they're full
lash they're not a super long lash and
I'm kind of more into a fuller shorter
length lash these days so I'm gonna
throw these guys on real quick Dan oh no
no no no can't wait for Game of Thrones
I always like to apply my lash and my
eyes open I think it helps to keep your
lash like upward instead of trying to
put your lash on when your eyes closed
so Prince EULA today I'm going to use my
NYX I always want to call it Ultra HD
but Ultra HD is make it forever this is
the HD photogenic concealer and is any
color of C wo3
and you're just going to use this to
brighten up the under-eye area and just
conceal any darkness that's under there
and then again with just stamping
pushing motions we're just going to push
the product into the skin and the brush
I'm using is so balm for Patty and ouch
your concealer under your eye this is
the soft blend concealer brush from
Sigma like this is the only thing that I
used for underneath here it's just this
brush just to be sure we'll take our
Beauty Blender and just pounce it
lightly to pick up any excess concealer
so that we don't get a lot of creasing
underneath our eye and then we're going
to set with you know what we're setting
with we're going to set with our laura
mercier secret brightening powder
now we bright under there and then to
set our whole face I am gonna use my
studio fix powder like I always do it's
just I'm not going to pick it up as
heavy I'm just going to swirl some of it
on there tap it off and then just use
whatever's on the brush to set the rest
of my makeup with so to bronze up the
face a little bit I'm going to again use
this NARS Laguna bronzer if you missed
my last video where I did that like
snapchat jewel die filter I talked about
this I got this at Namie's I don't know
if it's limited edition or what but it's
just a huge pan of Laguna bronzer which
is a great brown olive tone bronzer
there's no like orange enos in it which
is a lot of bronzers have and huh it
just smells so delicious so we're just
going to bronze up the face smells like
flowers so my camera just freezes on me
sometimes and I don't even realize it I
just added a little bit of loose powder
here because sometimes I get a little uh
crazy with my bronzer so I just use a
little bit of this is the NARS soft
velvet loose powder and just a cosmetic
wedge not to really bake but just to
kind of clean up my edges a little bit
and they're so uneven right now so we'll
just let that sit there for a second and
we're gonna move on to blush I think I'm
going to use this guy right here which
is from Mac and it's called make you
mine cuz I don't want a lot of like
blush color that's a lot of blush color
huh again taking your duo fiber brush
you can just sweep all that away and
then for our highlight today we're going
to use starburst from anastacio surprise
surprise I'm not going to use crush Pro
we're gonna use star brush what we're
gonna use starburst
tone it down hit it with a stippling
brush first to knock off the excess
powder and then go over it or just just
a little spray and then we'll go over it
to melt it into the skin then take your
booklet and then take your blush brush
you're not to put any excess product on
it but you can just go right over your
cheeks to bring the color back a little
bit because sometimes the highlight kind
of overtakes that and I just like to go
over the highlight one more time with
like a big fluffy brush this doesn't
it's like very flimsy so it's great to
highlight with this is a morphe 500 just
pick up a little bit of the highlight
and then just go over your cheek like
all together to really get glowing oh
girl
okay so we're basically done all we're
gonna do is our lip I think I want to do
this like little nudie Brown lip this is
from an associate is any color Ashton I
had it on the other day and I really
liked how it looked so you can either do
a nude lip you can do a really bright
pink lip with this but I'm going to kind
of go for like a little bit of a nudie
Brown look I'm also then going to add a
little bit of nude to it this is from
Velvet 59 and it's in the color vanilla
macaroon so we're going to add this here
and then I'm just taking a lip pencil or
a lip brush kind of meshing these
together fingers work just as good and
then to finish our lip I'm going to use
this ease by Yves and this one is the
luminous shine a volumizing lip lustre
which I talked about in one of my
favorites this one is in the color
golden ray and I'm just going to put
this right on top has a little bit of
gold shimmer in it these glasses are
really nice they have um a really nice
feel to them they're not sticky at all
they're really smooth and they also
taste good and smell really good so this
is the finished look glittery glowy
glossy you know all of the above so now
we're going to try to braid this hair
hopefully it kind of comes out how I see
it in my
and that was just on Pinterest last
night and I was looking at like tons of
braided hair I didn't see this
particular one like I saw stacked braids
but I didn't see like these pigtails
stack braids and I feel like I had a
dream about it last night because I woke
up and I was like I have to try it so
we're gonna try it and hope that it
works out for us so I'm going to use
these extensions from Bellamy these are
the guy paying biologics tensions I
forget the number but I will list it in
the bottom bar of what the color of
these extensions are always want to make
sure that you brush your hair out before
you braid it it don't just be easier for
you um if there's no tangles or anything
in your hair and then I'm gonna wear
mine down the middle so what off and
then we're just going to click this
little guy up out the way while we work
on this braid make sure you have some
little elastics my hair in an old
eyelash things exploded everywhere so
we're just going to section the top and
then kind of go in and down motion if
you didn't see my how I Dutch free
pigtails
maybe watch that video too I'll show you
a little bit slower on how I clip in my
extensions basically we're just going to
clip them in going down like this so
they hide in our hair I can braid you
can braid now we're going to let this
hair fall over I think I might need to
add two extensions for this one because
we're going to do a stacked braid so
it's going to be like a fishtail braid
and then a regular braid stacked on top
of that braid that's the cool thing
about clip-in extensions is you can just
clip them where you need them so that
should be enough hair for me to work
with so I'm gonna start my braid like a
Dutch braid on top so I'm just going to
take a section of hair split it into
three parts and start braiding one two
three and we're going to pull everything
underneath the middle section of hair so
we're going to take this front piece and
we're going to pull it underneath the
middle piece and they're going to take
our back piece pull it underneath the
middle piece I like to do this two times
without adding hair just to kind of
start a base and then we'll start adding
hair so you take your front piece you'll
grab a little bit of hair add it to that
and then put that underneath
your middle piece you're going to grab
from your back you're going to add a
little bit more hair from there and
you're going to add that underneath your
middle and then you're just going to
repeat very repetitive you're just
grabbing and adding hair and pulling it
underneath the middle section of hair
and try to keep everything it nice and
tight when you're braiding even though
we do loosen up our braid I like to make
sure it's tight to begin with and then
we can loosen when we want to oh my god
children was screaming out the window
I'm just going to grab all this hair
that's left back here and add that to
our back piece and braid that in real
quick just because doesn't really matter
okay
so then when we get to here I'm going to
stop and I'm going to tie this off a
little bit of loop twice it will just a
little bit once we're going to do two
braids here just split this here so this
we're going to braid just as a regular
braid so you're just going to split it
into three sections and then we're just
going to braid normally again you can
try to be tight with your braids and
then we'll loosen everything at the end
because you know that I like a more
messy looking look I can't tell them in
focus or not I'm so sorry and then I'm
going to tie him off so then I'm going
to take the rest of this hair and we're
going to fishtail this so try to kind of
get this guy out of your way if you can
so then I just clip that braid up out of
the way so we can work on our fishtail
so what you're going to do is going to
take your remaining hair remaining hair
remaining remaining hair and you're
going to split it into two sections and
then we're just going to fishtail this
so how you fishtail is like you split it
into sections and then you take hair
from the back of either side and you
pull it over and you add it to the other
side
so then you take care from the back and
you add it over to the other side again
we're going to add take care from the
back and you just put it over to start
it it's a little like what but you'll
get it so take it and pull it over add
it to the hair this is the most
time-consuming part to me is fishtail
braiding I'm still kind of a little
rough at it and then eventually it'll
start to look like a fishtail braid so
with braiding it's just very repetitive
so you're just going to keep doing the
same thing over and over
grabbing sections from the back and
adding them to the opposite side and see
we kind of have a little fishtail coming
along
at creepin listen I can't I can't calc
so I'm gonna tie this guy off for now we
do still have a lot of hair at the end
but I want to start pulling the braid
out meaning I'm going to start making it
bigger so what I do is tie it off where
the braid ends so you can see all the
excess hair and then I'm just going to
slide it down a little bit so we have
room to start pulling out our braid so
what you want to do is to start pulling
it to making it to make it look bigger
so then you can pull slide this down
more so you have more room to pull just
be careful this guy to be pretty big so
I'm just going to keep pulling and then
we can take this guy this braid and do
the same thing we're going to slide this
down and then start pulling this braid
out you don't want to make this one too
big because this braid is going to sit
right here on top of this braid on top
of your other braid so you can just pull
it out enough keep pulling this guy and
then what you want to do is you want to
line up your two braids so they sit on
top of each other like this and then you
can take the elastics out so I pulled
out the one elastic from our top braid
and I'm going to leave the fishtail
bottom one in and I'm just going to tie
these off right where that other guy is
and then I'm just going it to pin it in
the middle of the braid to connect the
two braids together should have got
blond ones because you can just see that
guy hanging there so then we can loosen
this up a little bit too so it matches
all the rest of our madness happening so
all I do is just pull the braid and
it'll loosen it up for you and then I'm
going to pin the braid right here to my
head like that
then we have step well we have one
stacked pigtail okay so here's our
stacked braid it is a fishtail and a
just regular three strand on top of it
it's a little messy but I like it like
that should I kind of separate the two
so you can see the fishtail and the
regular I think I like it better like
that
these are stacked down the middle like
it's just laying on top but as I get to
the bottom I want you to be able to tell
that we have a regular and a fishtail so
I'm just going to keep them like this
close to each other like next to each
other and then pin them that way so you
can tell what we've got going on this
freaking and gold bobby pin is not doing
me any justice whatever alright so now
we're going to try to attempt to do the
other side I always struggle more so
with this side of my hair then this side
which is I don't know why KKK I love it
not going to talk through this one so we
can get this guy done quicker but we're
just going to do the same exact thing
success except for these bobby pins that
don't go with my hair if you're gonna do
these braids get bobby pins that met
your hair color don't be running around
black ones if you got blonde hair and
gold so I'm super excited on how these
came out I love them so much I am really
into the braided pigtails I think that
there was super cute way to keep all
your hair off your face if you don't
want to wear it like a messy bun like
I'm always doing it's a great
alternative and I just like this one a
lot more it kind of is just a little bit
different than the normal pigtail braids
everyone is wearing so go S of course it
does take a little bit more time but I
think it just looks so cool and I think
the Messier the braids the cooler it
looks that's just me I like really messy
boho e looking hair but you can totally
make this look a little more put
together you know you just have to pull
it apart as much as I did but like I
said I'm totally into messy textured
Braves I just think it makes them look
more better more better mo better so I
hope you guys try it out it is super
easy to do I promise you I would not
steer you guys wrong it just takes a
little bit of practice that's all that
it is braiding is super repetitive and
remember if you're struggling try not
looking in a mirror just try doing it
with your hands because for some reason
when you look in a mirror or I look at
my viewfinder I always like Club and if
you have to start over don't feel
discouraged I usually always have to
start my braids over so don't get
discouraged if you don't get it on your
first time I promise you if you just
practice you will get it and you'll soon
be able to rock these cute little
stacked pigtail Dutch friends I don't
even know we'll just call them stacked
Dutch braids uh so I hope you guys
enjoyed I don't think I have anything
else to tell you I'm excited for Game of
Thrones tonight and I'm not excited for
my root canal tomorrow
wish me luck so that is it for this
video if you do recreate this look
please tweet it to me or tag me on
Instagram because I'd love to see your
guy's recreations and yeah I don't think
I have anything else to tell you guys
except I love you thank you so much for
watching and until next time I will talk
to you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
