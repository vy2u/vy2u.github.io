Hold please
Hello and welcome back to my channel!
Today we're gonna do my everyday kind of go to face. This face I do all the time
Anytime I wear it in a vlog you guys always ask to see it
I'm sure that I have done a look similar to this in the past
But I have been wanting to kind of do updated versions of looks that I've done before.
Just kind of keep it like updated and fresh, maybe some things have changed
Maybe some things have stayed the same
This look like I said, I wear all the time. The main thing that usually changes is the foundation like I said
We're gonna be I don't even know if I said it yet, but if I haven't said it. Let me say it now
We are going to be trying a new foundation in this video
We're gonna be trying out the NARS  natural radiant longwear foundation
I've heard really good things about it, and I am in the shade
Santa Fe no I'm not I am NOT in the shade Sante Fe.
Maybe I am no I actually you know what I lied.
I am in the shade Santa Fe I'm
Thinking of the concealer because you guys know I'm a longtime fan of the NARS radiant creamy concealer that is my OG
that was probably my first high end concealer
I ever bought so it holds like a special place in my heart, so I'm excited to try this foundation
I am in the shade Santa Fe and if you notice this little puncture wound happening on my face
No it is
Not a blemish it is legit a puncture wound it happened this morning me and my baby orange cat we sleep together
He's not a baby. He's 6 years old, but he's a baby to me, and we sleep really close together
He like legit sleeps on my face and then like sometimes when he wakes up
He like reaches out like this and puts his hands on my face his hands his paws on my face
And he put his nail out this morning, and he poked me right in my cheek
And it didn't hurt and I woke up and I was like oh great
Perfect, but I thought it would be like a good test for the foundation to see the coverage. That's happening it is flat
There's not like a bump happening which is the important part.
But I've heard really great things about this foundation like it's super lightweight
and it's full coverage so
two things
That I look for. So if you guys want to hang out with me for the next couple of minutes while we do our makeup?
I would like that. To start our look
You know I'm always gonna moisturize my face, and I'm always gonna prime it for primer today
We're gonna use the NARS pore and shine control primer. This is an oil-free makeup primer
It's gonna help control shine throughout the day. It's also going to mattify the skin a little bit
While also making your makeup last longer. I'm on this kick now. Where if I'm using the foundation
I want to use the primer that goes with it like it
Just seems to make more sense right so I'm on that kick right now for a foundation today
I'm using the NARS natural radiant longwear foundation in the shade Santa Fe which is a medium with peachy undertones there are
33 different shades available so you have a little something for everybody and they use this cool technology
Where they take this translucent base and skin matching pigments that recognize and fuse with your skin to give the foundation a super natural
Skin like look which I think is really cool as you can see the foundation is
Super duper full coverage, and it still feels lightweight and breathable, which to me is like the best of both worlds
You know I love a full coverage foundation, so I was here for this all day like I said it was still breathable
It had a beautiful natural finish to it not too matte not too dewy
Just perfect, but like all your imperfections covered
I was really blown away by this foundation it never felt dry it never felt cakey it blended seamlessly
I'm trying to think of more things that I can tell you that I love about this foundation
But I think I covered them. Long wearing, full coverage
Radiant, natural, breathable, lightweight, like can you think of anything better because I can't. Bomb!
All right for the brows I did a whole brow tutorial, so I will link it in the bottom bar
But I'm just going to show you guys what I do
I just use gel and I brush all my hair's up
This is when I don't want to fill in my brows, and I'm going for a more natural look
I know it looks crazy to begin with but just wait till the end
I promise that it will come together. For the eyes we're not gonna do much
We're just going to set with some of the Maybelline fit me loose powder
This is a finishing powder, so it does have a little bit of color to it
I mainly do this because I don't want any creasing from the
Foundation to happen on my lids because if I don't set it with something it'll happen
You can either use translucent powder you can use a finishing powder you can use a nude eyeshadow
Anything you want that just looks super duper natural. That's going to lock everything in so nothing moves around nothing slips
You might get sweaty. I get sweaty, so that's why I have to do it
No explanation needed we are just curling our lashes for this look. Sometimes I do wear falsies with it but for today
I'm just gonna use my natural lashes. I'm gonna use my natural lashes like I can take them on and off.
haha!
We're just gonna work with our natural lashes today. So whenever I am just rocking the natural lash
I like to mix and match mascaras. So first, I want to start with the Maybelline and Gigi Hadid mascara
I will have the full name listed in the bottom bar one side has like fibers on it. I never use that side
I just like the mascara wand that's why I like this one
And then I'm going to double it up with the L'Oreal voluminous carbon black
I really like this one if I only had to use one mascara for the rest of my life
It would definitely be it because it's just that good and it plumps up the lashes nicely
For concealer today, I'm using the NARS radiant creamy concealer in Cannelle light
2.75 I'm using it mainly to highlight so when doing that you're gonna want to go 2 shades up from your skintone
Or if you wanted to use the concealer to contour
Which you can do as well you would want to go 2 shades down. This is my OG concealer
This probably is the first high-end concealer I ever bought and it's never let me down. It's really hydrating
It's long wearing and you can also build the coverage in this concealer from a medium coverage to a more high coverage
It also blends out seamlessly. I have no complaints with this concealer
I never have it never looks cakey or heavy underneath the eyes
I think it's because it is so hydrating that it just makes everything look so smooth underneath there
To set our concealer I'm using the Becca under-eye brightening setting powder
This is a first time for me as well, and I really like this powder
I think that it laid nicely underneath the eyes. It didn't look heavy, and it didn't settle into any of my fine lines
To bronze up the face. I'm using the Loreal infallible Pro contour. I think this is in light. I really love this bronzer
I love the shade of it
It's very like grey like more shadowy so it's not super warm, so I feel like it just gives off a really natural
looking
Contour so I've been loving this guy. For blush we're gonna try out the new jouer blushes. They are super pigmented
I'm using mine in the Coquette blush duo. You need a very light hand otherwise things will get crazy here
I just like to go back underneath my
Powder to make sure it looks smooth for highlight
So we're gonna again use the wet and wild blossom glow highlighting powder because this is a really amazing
Highlighter like look at the amount of glow
You get from this little guy so my brush isn't wet I don't have any fix+ nothing on it
It's just dry powder and it is glowing girl
Going back in with our L'Oreal mascara. I'm going to use this to set my brows
I really like doing this when I don't have any like brow powder or other product in my brows
I feel like it really helps them to look texturized and more bushy
And I love it because it shows me the amount of growth my brows have achieved if you've been following me for a long time
You know this is the most brow hair. I've ever had ever and I'm proud of it
You can add mascara to the lower lashline if you want
I am NOT going to add mascara this time because sometimes it gets a little too hot out and then the mascara transfers to the
Bottom so I am skipping it for this look and lastly for our lips
You could totally leave the balm and be good to go
But I'm going to use one of my other favorite matte nudes, and no it is not Maybelline 535
It's Maybelline 545
But these Maybelline matte lipsticks are one of my favorites because they're just effortless and they are really really comfortable lipstick to wear
But we're not just leaving it as a matte lip no
We're not you know we're throwing on a gloss and we are using the Maybelline vivid hot lacquer in a new shade
We're not using Tease we're using Too Cute. I love these glasses really comfy super glossy
Must-have so that's it for this look guys. I hope you enjoyed
I love you and as always I will see you guys in the next video.
