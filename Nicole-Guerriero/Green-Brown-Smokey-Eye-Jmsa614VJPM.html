forgot to film an intro don't kill me
but this is a look we're gonna do today
it's just a green brown smokey eye super
fun for fall so the first thing I'm
going to do is you know the drill I'm
going to prime my face with benefits
Porefessional and then we're going to
move right on to foundation and I'm just
going to mix two colors of my L'Oreal
True Match w5 and w6 because as you can
see my faux tan has worn away so after
our foundation is applied I'm just going
to remove the excess from my lips and
pop on a little chapstick to keep those
baby moisturized and I went ahead and
did my brows off-camera I know you guys
want a tutorial and it's coming soon
I swear so moving on to our eyes I'm
gonna use the beach party girl After
Hours palette and I'm gonna pick up the
white shade and I'm going to use this to
highlight our brow bone
going back into our palette I'm going to
pick up this light brown color and I'm
going to use that to define our crease I
want to keep everything nice and soft
and smoky so just make sure you take
your time and blend here I'm just taking
a brush that has no extra product on it
and smoothing over everything again to
make sure we have no harsh lines then
the next thing you're going to want to
do is take a flat brush and dampen it
I'm just using fix+
now we're going to take our wide and
free palette from BH Cosmetics and this
a beautiful green color and then we're
going to pack that all over our lid
leaving the outer corner bare because
we'll be packing a brown shadow there in
a second
the cool thing about these little beach
cosmetics pallets are that they are
baked eyeshadows which means you can use
them wet or dry dry for a softer look
and wet for a more intense pigmented
look so what I like to do is pack on the
color wet and then go over it when it's
dry so here I'm packing on just a little
bit of the dry color and then we're
going to go right back into our pallet
we're gonna pick up this gorgeous warm
brown color and we're going to use that
on the outer corner of our eye we're
also going to bring it up into our
crease a little bit and again
just make sure you blend so you don't
have any posh lines that like never gets
old of me saying that right so again
this is me just blending with a brush
that has no extra product on it to make
sure everything is just melting together
and I don't know if I said it or not but
I am using this color dry not wet the
only color that we're going to use wet
was that green color that we packed all
over the lid
you
now taking the lighter green shade in
the palette I'm going to use this dry as
well and just a finger and I'm going to
just dab that in between the darker
green and the brown so that we have a
nice gradation of color and then I'm
just going to take a brush and smooth
out any of the edges
I haven't really been doing winged
eyeliner lately but I felt like this
look could use a wing so that's all that
I'm doing if you want to skip the winged
liner you go girl
skip it
next I'm just going to pop on a few
coats of mascara so that we can prep our
little lashes for some false lashes and
I've been using the white glue but can I
just say I hate the white glue I need to
go get the dark glue because I don't
like it for my lashes I'm using the
Ardell double ups in 206 these are a
little tricky at first because the band
is a little tight so just make sure you
wiggle them around to get a good fit and
then I just like to squeeze those babies
right on my natural lashes and voila
lashes are on
so taking my pro concealer in the color
I have no idea but you know it'll be
listed in the bottom bar I'm just going
to highlight and conceal underneath my
eyes I know it seems like a lot of
concealer but you blend a lot of it out
I like to blend with my finger and then
blend everything out with a damp Beauty
Blender
then going in with some bronzer we're
going to warm up the face I'm going it
to hit my cheekbones my temples and
maybe a little on my chin and then you
know maybe drag something down the neck
so we don't look so why hey going in
with my BH Cosmetics blush palette I'm
going to take this pinky orange and
apply that to our cheeks and then we're
going to blend everything out with a
large stippling brush to make sure that
we don't have any harsh lines and
everything is just blending smoothly
together then taking a brown pencil
liner we're going to run this underneath
our lower lash line about halfway over
then grabbing a pencil brush we're just
going it to buff it out so we don't have
just a harsh stark line under there it's
gonna be nice and smooth and blended and
yeah that always happens when I mess
around down there and yeah you better
fix that bun mmm going back into our
palette we're going to use that warm
brown color that we used on the outer
half of our eye and just smoke that
lower lash line out you can take this
down as far as you want whatever you're
comfortable with and since it is miss
queen bee's birthday you know I had to
sing some Beyonce in this video hey
happy birthday big going back into the
palette we're taking that same color
that we smoked at our lower lash line
with and we're just darkening up our
crease to make it a little more dramatic
picking up that lightest green shade I'm
just going to pop this into the inner
tear ducts of my eye blending it right
down onto the lower lash line right into
the brown that we've got working down
there so I just like to powder over my
lips and then taking our Milani lip
liner in the color nude I'm just going
to line my lips the natural shape of my
lips and then fill everything in with
the lip liner
now I think you could totally leave it
like this if you want to rock the matte
lip mmm work but I'm going to just add a
little bit of a nude gloss this is from
gerard cosmetics and you guessed it the
color nude Hey
and then I just couldn't resist my cat
in the background look at our little
head it's just so cute so anyways after
you are done messing with your cat this
look is complete I hope you guys enjoyed
let me know what you guys want to see
next I don't think I have anything else
to say except I love you guys thanks so
much for watching and until next time I
will talk to you guys soon bye
that is not the most annoying thing of
life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
