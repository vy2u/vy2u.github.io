am not professional I'm just sharing
with you what I did to my hair to get
this time
hey guys so today is one should be about
how I got my hair this red from that
dark brown it was relatively easy my
hair is not damaged can I repeat that
not damaged there's a lot that I want to
talk about and a lot but I want to show
you in this video so not sure how long
it's going to be but I'm going to try to
make it kind of easy and hopefully easy
for you to understand
so we all know that red hair is hard to
upkeep I hate that since I've dyed my
hair red everybody wants to tell me how
hard it's going to be how much it's
gonna wash out blah blah blah everything
that I do I research I researched red
hair I've been looking into dyeing my
hair red for a really long time I didn't
wake up one day and say you know what
I'm gonna go Rihanna red no I researched
I did lots of research how to take care
of this color how to get this color
which color would be best for lots and
lots of stuff went into me dyeing my
hair red it wasn't spur the moment it
was really really thought
I researched the best haircolor to get
to get my hair this really red color
from being such a dark brown color and
having dyed hair bleached hair all kinds
of stuff I've done to my hair so um the
thing that I found that had the best
reviews L'Oreal hi color highlights for
dark hair only in the color red which
looks like this
you can find this product at Sally's
Beauty Supply some Sally's have it out
on display some salads have it behind
the counters so if you want to get this
red color get red don't get magenta
don't get copper it's only a one point
two fluid ounce tube it's really little
it just looks like this but one tube did
my whole head this does contain bleach
obviously you have to mix this with
developer developer that I use is from
L'Oreal as well and I just use 30 volume
developer cream which just looks like
this you can find this at Sally's as
well think when I say that I didn't use
bleach as I meant that I did not bleach
my brown hair before I went this bright
red I just used this color and developer
right here this has bleach in it but not
enough bleach to kill your hair I use
this color choice to help the hi color
highlights I did it twice how many times
you go say you did it twice because the
first time as you'll see when we get to
the tutorial part of this video when I
did it my roots will come out the
brightest if you have any regrowth of
your hair your roots are gonna come out
the brightest because that's virgin hair
it's never been colored or anything so
my my roots were like like super super
super red and the ends of my hair were
super super red because they had bleach
and they were lighter at the ends it was
really really dark like around this part
of my hair because that's where the
color was and you know the growing out
part so that part did come out red it
was just a darker red so I waited
another day and I did the L'Oreal hi
color highlights in red again and that
kind of helped it all out I didn't do my
roots the second time that I did it I
left my roots alone because this is the
color that my roots were when I first
did my hair I did it a second time and
did it all the way down because my my
ends were a little bit darker they
weren't as bright as my roots so I did
it a second time and did it all the way
down and then it came out this color
that it is right now
I do have extensions in obviously the
extensions that I'm wearing are from
Sally's Beauty Supply and the color cool
blonde and I just dyed them with a
beyond the color zone you guys will see
it in the video I totally Toni remember
the names um but that's what I dyed my
hair extensions which ends the hair
extensions are a little um lighter than
my hair and that is because I haven't
redone them yet
red hair is really hard to keep up with
because the molecules in red hair dye
are a lot bigger than any other hair
color so they don't really stick to your
hair like the other ones do and that's
why it washes out so fast so the thing
that you want to remember about red hair
is do not wash your hair all the time
first of all I don't wash my hair all
the time anyway because it's not really
healthy for your hair I wash my hair
probably three times a week um and if
you're gonna have red hair you need to
wash your hair in cold water I found
these shampoos at Sally Beauty Supplies
and they're riveting Reds which just
look like this and these are color
refresher shampoos so just like when I
dyed my hair on brand I went out and
bought a purple shampoo because I had
blonde hair since I dyed my hair red I
went out and bought a red shampoo and
conditioner and when I say this stuff is
red it's red so conditioner and shampoo
are both super red um and they kind of
like stain your hands I feel like when
you're in the shower but it's whatever
it's depositing color back into your red
hand what I do get in the shower and
wash my hair red pours out like crazy
but it still hasn't like lost any of its
like vibrancy or anything another thing
is is you're probably if you're gonna
have your hair this bright red you're
gonna be dyeing your hair a lot so think
about that do you have the money to buy
the hair type do you have the money for
the upkeep of having your hair this
crazy bright red color but I do plan on
dying my hair probably every three weeks
or so just to keep that vibrant color
and if you plan on going bright red like
this I recommend that if you're going to
use the l'oreal high color lift and when
you're doing touch-ups to only touch up
your roots and use kind of like a Manic
Panic or be on the zone to refresh the
bottom of your hair because if you keep
using the high color lift and the
developer throughout your whole head
you're gonna just keep pulling color
like out of your hair so that when the
red kind of washes out of your hair
you're going to be left with like this
like weird orange color because you've
been using a developer on your all of
your hair the whole time so I will be
doing like touch-up videos and how I
touch up my roots and stuff like that
and in a future video
if I didn't mention something in the
video that you're not too sure about
please leave a comment down below I will
resounding two serious questions I do
not want you guys to mess up your hair
if you're scared to do this or if you
don't think that you can do it please do
not do it if you have black hair like
really black hair and you just colored
your hair I would not recommend doing
this um with the l'oreal high color lip
because you're probably only going to
get really bright roots and the rest of
your hair is probably not going to take
to it because you've got fresh colored
hair and you've got black on your hair
so please if you're going to do this
research it do reviews read everything
like make sure that you're 100%
confident in yourself that you can
achieve this hair color without damaging
your hair i put masks on my hair the
macadamia oil deep repair mask after i
colored it because again you're using
developer so developer activates bleach
so there's obviously like I said bleach
in the Lauria high color lifts but I did
not not not bleach my entire head to get
this hair color I think that's all that
I want to say again if you have any
questions and you're not sure please
leave them down below leave them on my
facebook get them to me and I will
promise you that I will get back to you
on your red hair questions because I do
not not not not want you guys to damage
your hair trying to get this crazy-ass
red color so I'm going to go ahead and
stop rambling I think I've rambled for
about ten minutes and go ahead and get
into the tutorial part of this video I
was showing you how I color my hair and
how I color this weave so if you guys
want to see how to get Rihanna red hair
then just keep watching this video
thanks guys bye
we're going at to mix up and I'm just
going to be taking this like I said
permanent highlights and open it and
then just pop that it's got a little
point right there never dyed your hair
before and get it in there open it up oh
my god
and then we're just going to squeeze all
this in to our little bowl so then I
just have it this little measuring cup
and it does have ances on it everything
so I'm just going to measure out two
point four fluid ounces of I'm using 30
developer by L'Oreal all right pop that
in there and then you could mix that
with a back of your brush that you paint
on like you can mix it with the back of
this but red hair dyes got larger
particles so I have just this little
mini whisk makes it a lot easier so you
just want to mix this together and you
want to try to get all the chunks out
because red hair dye is kind of on the
chunky side that's why the look is comes
in handy and you can find these little
whisks at Sally's for like a dollar all
right so after you're done mixing you
should have something that looks like a
red velvet cake
wish me luck okay guys really quick
you're just gonna paint your whole head
with your brush and your color you're
going to work from the bottom up because
sense your roots are virgin hair the
colors going to take to them very
quickly so you want to leave your roots
for last so that the color isn't on
there for as long but basically you're
just going to do the same thing
throughout your whole head so yeah happy
coloring
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
