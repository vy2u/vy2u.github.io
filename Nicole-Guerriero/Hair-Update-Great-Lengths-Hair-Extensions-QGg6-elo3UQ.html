update on my hair if you guys have been
watching the past couple of my recent
videos and you've looked in the bottom
bar you notice that I haven't really
been including what hair extensions I've
been wearing and that's because I
actually have in Great Lakes hair
extension at the moment if you guys
aren't familiar with what great links
are I can like never say it I like
always get tongue-tied that is bonded in
hair extensions if you are familiar with
bonded and hair extensions I will show
you really quickly before we go on in
this is what bonded in hair extensions
look like they are just obviously
individual about that big of bonded in
hair so you can see all these little
bonds all in my hair and they just look
like that that is a keratin bond keratin
is the same exact thing that your
natural hair is made out of and it's
gently heated and then twisted around
your hair that's what I have all over my
entire head I have five bundles in my
hair start you know starting from all
the way here and then they go all the
way up to about right here
all over my entire head first day oh my
god horrible was I go these words about
like I couldn't lay down I could put my
head down or anything like that but then
the next day they were fine it's just
when they're right at your root that
kind of heard a little bit but now
they've kind of grown down like I said
I've had them in actually I don't know
if I said this I've had them in for two
weeks now it's pretty cool to just wake
up and go and now helps clip your hair
and you can put your hair on the top of
your head don't have to worry about
anything
the reason that I got great links hair
extensions is because I feel like on
YouTube I'm kind of known as the hair
extension person like I am overwhelmed
with hair extension questions on a daily
basis and people always want to know
what's the best kind the only two I'd
recently had before was clip-in hair
extensions and glue and hair extensions
glue ins clippings so the reason that I
did go get these was a lot to do with
YouTube because I want it to be able to
tell you guys my experience in them and
what I personally thought about them the
main thing that you want to do if you're
going to get bonded in hair extensions
is one I would definitely definitely
definitely go with great links I did
tons of research I've been researching
bonded hair extensions for probably
about three or four months and I found
that great lengths are the best that you
can get and a lot of other like bonded
in hair the bonds are really big like
you can't see these bonds like in my
hair at all and now that they have like
I've had them in for about two weeks
you can barely like feel them when you
rub the back of your head lots of people
have told me you know don't get bonded
in hair extensions it'll ruin your hair
blah blah blah well the girl that I went
to in Tampa at Salon Monaco's where I
went and got these done she's had ten
years experience in great links so
that's what I was looking for I was
looking for somebody who knew what they
were doing I wasn't looking for somebody
that just took the great lengths course
just got out of hair school do hair no I
wanted a profession now so I found her
thank God she said she's worn grading
set great lengths for nine years and she
says like anything it all has to do with
you she's like if you take care of your
extension she's like it's not going to
do anything back to your hair and she
also takes before-and-after pictures of
your hair mainly before pictures because
she says that people get so used to
having their hair and that they kind of
think that this is what their hair looks
like the same what your hair looks like
girl um that when they do get them
removed they're like oh my god my hair
so thin it's so damaged look with these
extensions did she whips out that before
after and she's like no not really look
at your hair before looks pretty much
identical I like that I know that my
hair is damaged like I'm not gonna front
act like oh yeah girl my hair so good no
I have damaged hair that's why I wear
hair extensions hello if I had naturally
flowing beautiful hair I wouldn't be
clipping and we'd would I know I wanted
to get these because I like to base my
opinion on my own experiences I'm not
going to not get something done because
one person said oh my god I had the
worst experience you know it's kind of
like when people are like you're like oh
did you like that movie they're like no
it was horrible and then you go and
watch it you know what was that person
talking about this is the funniest movie
of life I have to experience things for
myself
so that's why when got these done um it
took her three hours to actually put in
five bundles of hair it actually took
them longer to color correct my hair it
took them four hours to color correct my
hair and only three to put on my weave
in some things that you want to think
about
this hair is a lot of work girl like
it's nice to get up in the morning and
you know just go I throw my hair up and
just leave I'm gonna put my weave in or
anything like that it's already in but
you have to brush it at least twice a
day I brush mine almost four times a day
because I don't want it to get tangled I
don't want anything to mess up and you
have to get a kind of like special brush
it has like plastic at the top and then
like little boar bristles because this
brush lets you get right up by your
bonds so that you can brush them and
there's no tangles around them the
reason that great lengths is considered
like the Bentley of like hair extensions
is because it's 100% human hair it is a
keratin bond and it is the smallest I
believe keratin bond that you can get
with bonded and hair extensions they
will last you between four and six
months was a really long time people
consider like oh my god those hair
extensions are so expensive well they
kind of last you almost a half of the
year like if you take care of them so
you gotta have to weigh that out another
thing is if you get them in you have to
wait 48 hours before you can wash your
hair to make sure the bonds really
really set you need to remember if you
do get bonded in hair extensions you
have to use like a sulfate-free kind of
shampoo and conditioner and actually the
one that I've been using I'll show you
guys is the macadamia natural oil
flawless which looks like this this is
what I've been using this is a new
product
hello I'm talking like this this is
actually a new products from macadamia
and it is a cleanse conditioned refine
and perfect it's kind of like a
all-in-one like you know the L'Oreal or
the win you know it's one-stop shop kind
of situation and it's weird it's like a
dressy all that it's like a like a foam
but not really a foam and it's like kind
of thick it reminds me more of like a
shaving cream situation so I wish it
smelled like the whatever but it's
sulfate free it's paraben free it's what
I use on my hair when I get the shower
it's the only thing that I use it don't
use a shampoo or conditioner that's all
that I use on my hair let me show you
what my hair looks like wet as you guys
can see this is what it looks like when
I get out of the shower it has a real
like curly texture to it which I love
because when it dries it just dries to
like a natural like curl so on days that
I don't really blow dry my hair anything
I still have this like nice body wave to
it which I like and then I put it up and
it's like curly and full and everything
so I like that the hairdryer that I use
is the TG r4000 I um it seriously
ballasts my hair it cuts down drying
time like that
um it's crazy how fast it like blow
drives my hair cuz I like I said I have
a lot of hair on my hair head now show
you guys what it looks like
No
you got the discarded in the Rose Bowl
you boy that's a fact
you got this boy better than the rest
boy you got the boy so then that's what
my hair looks like when it's completely
brogurt blow dry but that's what it
looks like when it's straight so it
looks like a big fur ball when you blow
dry it because I'm not taking time to
round brush and all that I don't have
time for all that
as you can see I blow dry like a
madwoman and it just gets the job done
and I'm just going to straighten it
anyway so what's the point of blowing it
out I don't have time for all that never
did never will
let's just talk about a few of the
little cons well these are only cons to
me they could not be constant you one is
I didn't realize how much I actually
loved clip-in hair extensions the reason
I love clip-in hair extensions so much
is the versatility the customization of
them some days if I want to wear my hair
this short I can if I want to wear it
down to my ankles I could you know what
I mean like if I want to clip more on
this side or if I want to clip more up
when I have a when I put my hair up I
can do that with clip in hair extensions
I can't do that with this hair and this
hair even though it's a lot of hair I
feel like it's half the amount of hair
that I normally wear when I wear clip in
extensions and it does look like a lot
of hair because it is a curly like
textured hair so I feel like that's what
gives it more of like a voluminous look
but when it's all said and done like I
technically wear more hair than this
when I wear my clip in extensions so I
will do the ride out I do love these
things it's cool like I said to wake up
in the morning do your hair and go and
not worry about clip showing or anything
like that but I think after the 4 to 6
months is up I'm just gonna get them
taken out and go right back to my clip
in hair extensions we'll see I'm about
two weeks in and I miss my weave they're
like sitting over there and I like to
look at them all the time and I feel
guilty they're like
like I'll be back what else do I want to
talk about I don't really put any
products in my hair anymore like I don't
put any oil or anything like maybe it's
it's like super fresh hair so it's not
dry or anything like if you guys can see
like how shiny it is it's super shiny
the color that I have in is 1b which is
kind of like a dark brown color even
though I do look black on camera it is
like a brownish color um so yeah the
only product that I use is my macadamia
I brushed my hair almost I probably like
four to five times a day I brush my hair
I'm always brushing my hair when I'm at
home it's easy that brush feels so good
on your head it's like oh so I think
that's everything that I wanted to talk
about if I left something out please
leave me a comment down below and make
sure you guys check the bottom bar for
lots of info and anything that I forgot
to mention this video so yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed and until next time
