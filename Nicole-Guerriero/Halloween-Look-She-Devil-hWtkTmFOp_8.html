Go Vikings, and yeah so today
We are going to do a kind of she-devil Blue Devil situation um I just a she-devil video like a long time ago
It was like a she-devil vampire, but it was really just like regular ass makeup with some things. Also. I'm a little sick, too
I feel like I get sick every time I travel and when I was in Jersey
It was like 40 degrees and it's like 90 degrees here, so I feel like the weather
Got me a little bit, so I want to talk about first the inspiration on aware. I got this look from UM
I follow I want to say her name right so let me pull up her G page real quick
also, if you hear like any background noise we are having a little bit of
Work done on the house. We're getting new floors installed so if you hear banging and clanging. It's the floor guy. I gotta sneeze
What are you talking about oh, we're talking on inspiration for this look, okay, so here's the girl that I got the inspiration from
If there she is okay, so her name is I think it's Jessica
Pin button my favorite thing about this look was her
Like heart that she had here, and I thought it would be cool if she was blue
not red just like do a little bit of a spin on a
She-devil because I feel like most people do make them red of course
But I thought I would make ours
Blue, so this is the artist that she was inspired by and what do I see right here?
I see a little blue devil so I scroll
The page here is the picture that she was inspired by and then there's a little blue devil right underneath that so I was like
This is perfect and I also know Chris. We put up a like pinup
Devil the other day, which hers was red as well, and I clicked on
Crispies page and it was actually inspired by amber car art as well so shout out to amber car art crispy Jessica pin
I hope I'm saying your name right. I'm so sorry if I'm not
For kind of giving me a little more inspiration for this look
But like I said we are going to make ours blue today and usually whenever I kind of have an idea for
I'm feeling chatty because the coffee is cooking in okay
Any time I have like an idea of what I want to do
I kind of google it to see if anybody else has done it so that the looks kind of don't the same as each other
You know so I didn't find any like Blue Devils or anything like that just kind of that artist one
But I did find one girl, and I want to show you her she-devil because she kind of did like a blue vibe
And I just want to show you guys hers as well, so this is makeup Mars. Hers is really cool, too
So I like her like detailing on the chest
And I really like the contrast between the blue and the red
Which I pulled blue and red to film this look force
So I just kind of wanted to give her
So I just wanted to shout out makeup Mars as well because I thought her she-devil was dope this is actually from
Last year this picture
But still really cool. It's not 8:30 8 p.m.
It is
10:57 a.m.
I just wanted to let you guys know where the inspiration for this look came from if you want to follow any of them I
Will have their links in the bottom bar all of them have really cool looks on their pages
So if you're looking for more halloween inspiration check them out
Maybe you'll get a little bit inspired to create something because Halloween is right around the corner
But I've always wanted to kind of do this like demon II look because I feel like it's scary
But I want to make mine blue, so it's not like super scary if that makes sense so we're gonna do a blue she-devil
We should probably get started. I've been chatting here forever
So I'm thinking that I'm going to
glue just the ends of my eyebrows down so that I can give my
She double kind of this
Look happening here. I feel like we've been gluing down our brows a lot again
it's totally optional you do not have to glue down your brows if you do not want to I just think it adds to the
Look cause it kind of changes up your natural like eye
Situation that you've got going on here look at us
When I paint myself I use these like water activated paints, so if you don't have the water activated paint switch
You still kind of want to paint yourself like a whole color you can take like an eye shadow that you don't really use
And kind of just scrape it off until it's like powder and then just mix it into any kind of
Foundation like a lighter color foundation, and then boom you have like instant face paint plus
I feel like it'll go on smoother because it is foundation
so that's just an option if you guys don't have the water activated paints because
These are fun and easy to use for Halloween and it's great for removal like it comes off SuperDuper easy
As soon as you jump into the shower
It just kind of melts away, but they are kind of pricey especially if you're only going to use them once a year
So I just wanted to give you guys that option as well. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to drink that quality voiceover activated
Ok the spatula showed up for this tutorial, so I'm just going to glue these things down, and you know the deal already
We're just trying to get our brows to lay as flat as they possibly can
So when we draw on our new brow, you can't really tell
Next I'm going to cover
All of my skin that you can see well, not everything at first
But eventually I will I'm just using this a graphic tobin Pro paint. This is in the shade baby blue and
we're just going to work this in I find that this paint lays a little bit better if I don't put on any primer or
Moisturizer so keep that in mind
Next using my makeup forever Pro palette mine is loved I'm going to create a little concoction
That's like a baby blue shade because the cream
Really helps to conceal the brows even more
So I just mixed white dark blue and turquoise and covered the ends of my brows and then just ran that cream color
Over my lids and underneath my eyes because I just feel like the eyeshadow sticks better to this oh, I'm showing you my horns
So they're brown clearly not Browns not gonna work for us
And we are going to adhere them with spirit gum that's why I have no paint on my forehead yet
So I'm just going to take my like red paint propane as well
This is water activated and just paint my horns red get a little spirit gum and apply that around the outer edge
Spirit gum is like lash glue you want to give it a second to get a little bit tacky
Then I'm going to pop on my horn
and you're gonna want to hold it there for a good minute or so and
After that you are good to go these things are not coming off you need spirit gum remover
To get them off well to get all the excess glue off
You can just pull them off it might hurt a little bit, and I'm gonna paint everything else
Next we're gonna get our evil brows going so to kind of just use it as my outline. I'm just gonna use some pomade
That's not super black, but we are gonna go over these guys in black
So I'm just mapping out how I want my brows. I just kind of want them to be super straight
I actually shouldn't do my brows like this like that's why I used to shave off it oh no yellow, man
That's what used to shave off the ends of my brows so here
I'm just going in with some black paint to darken those bad boys up
To start on the eyes
I'm going to take this red from
sugarpill cosmetics
and
Just start working this in my upper crease you guys know that I like to work a little bit of color in at a time
So this is going to be a process
I never stopped working on the eyes
So I'm just going back and forth back and forth between a small detailing brush
detailing brush and a fluffy brush just kind of
Just kind of building that intensity as I go now originally
I was going to do blue on my lid which you guys will see in a second
But I thought that I was just looking a little bit too patriotic for a she-devil
So I will eventually go in and cover that blue with black, so we're gonna do black and red eyes no blue mm
not today America
I'm gonna take that baby blue shade from the same palette and just use this to kind of even out any
Unevenness I see on my skin because sometimes the pro paint can be unforgiving so if you go over it with like an eye shadow
You'll help yourself out to cut these cheekbones
I'm just gonna start with a dark blue shade and then eventually go into the black shade and just build these up to my intensity
Liking did that make sense I'm gonna build these up until I like them basically is what I was going with so just
Do what you want here? You can follow along?
But I'm basically just contouring these cheeks
heavily
Do you guys know what you're gonna be for Halloween yet I
Am torn between two are you they want to be Morticia Addams?
Or John Snow. What do you think?
To brighten me up
I'm going to use this super white from Ben Nye and this helps to kind of brighten that under-eye area like I said plus
soften the edges of the contour
I'm also gonna go in with some red and black shadow right around the horns
Just to make it look like they're actually coming out of my skin and just not sitting on top of my skin
I'm sorry that it's focusing on my hand hmm
And like I said, I'm just always working on the eyes so here, I'm just intensifying everything the red and the black as well
Next we're gonna take a pencil eyeliner, and we're gonna run this in our waterline and our top white outline as well
I'm not gonna go all the way over though
I'm gonna leave some space in my inner corner and then taking a felt tip liner
I'm gonna use this to kind of extend my lower lash line
Down a little bit, and then an angled brush to really just kind of intensify and give it like a nice sharp edge
And then I'm gonna buff all that out with like a red shadow not with like a red shadow but with a red shadow okay?
like stop saying like
Going back into our little custom colored baby blue
I'm going to use this in my waterline
Raped up to the black and then I'm going to use that in between
The negative space between our new lower lash line and the corner of our eye
Next I'm gonna just finish painting the rest of my body except my right hand because I still need it
We are going to pop on some lashes, and then I'm going to do a little bit of shading around my neck area
I'm gonna draw basically my bleeding heart
From the amber car hearts no Hebrew car art
work
so if you do want to do this heart
I would definitely recommend referencing her photo cuz I'm happily cut off per usual so yeah
I'm just gonna draw a heart and
Basically try to replicate what she had in the painting
Shed some white specks in her heart
So I'm just taking some water activated pain and a paintbrush not a paintbrush a toothbrush and just flicking little white dots onto the heart
And then I'm just going to line my lips
I think I'm using cherry lip liner
But I'm not sure honestly any red lip liner and lipstick will work for this
I'm gonna fill them in with a liquid lip just because you want this to last forever
Especially you're gonna wear this out for Halloween, and I'm going to extend a basically winging out my top lip liner
I really like doing this I feel like it only works on me for like Halloween looks though
So I feel like I do it a lot, but I lacks it
Clearly I'm starting to feel myself here
I'm gonna pop in some red contacts and a wig, but other than that this she-devil look is complete
So I hope you guys enjoyed this one. I love you guys and
I will see you in the next Halloween</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
