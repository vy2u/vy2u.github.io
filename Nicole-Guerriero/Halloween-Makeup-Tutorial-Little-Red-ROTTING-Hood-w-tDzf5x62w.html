hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today we're gonna do a little red
riding-hood
I'm going to prep my face like I usually
do the breakouts are not cute these days
we're gonna start with hangover RX from
two-faced and then I'm going to follow
that up with benefits Porefessional next
I'm gonna grab some paint brushes or
just old makeup brushes that you don't
want to use again because we're gonna
use some liquid latex and this stuff is
going to just kill your brushes you're
gonna need some toilet paper or some
paper towels and you can find liquid
latex at your Halloween stores right now
so I'm going to do is start laying down
the latex where I want my rotting
peeling skin to appear and then I'm
going to lay tissue paper right on top
of that and then you just repeat the
process so after I have all of my tissue
paper laid down I'm gonna go back in
with the liquid latex and cover or right
over that and then go in again with
another layer of the tissue paper
so after about four or five layers of
tissue paper and latex you're just going
it to want to let that dry before we
peel it up
moving on to foundation I'm just going
to use a light foundation to even out my
skin tone so that we have an even base
to work with
then going in with my makeup forever
flash palette they do have three of
these I'm not sure which color palette
this is I'm gonna take that greenish
color it's a really good like dead color
and I'm going to apply this all over my
eyes as a beast
then taking my mega Pro palette I'm
gonna use the color stone to just start
hollowing out my eyes basically the only
color that I use from that palette is
the color stone it was just like
perfection
taking a matte black shadow I'm just
going to go right in the corners again
just for eight deep in towel effect
going back into my flash palette I'm
gonna take that brown color that's right
next to that green color I was pointing
at and I'm going to start sketching out
my cheeks to hollow out our face and
this is just easy I'm gonna go from the
center of my ear and then drag it
straight down giving a little curve kind
of where your cheekbones would be and
I'm just kind of thickening the line up
with the same pencil brush that I used
to apply it and then I'm gonna go in
with this brush right here that has no
product on it and just blend it out even
more
and don't be afraid to get in there with
your fingers there are the best blending
tools that you have here I'm just taking
a little bit of foundation that was
already on our brush and just lightening
that area up because I are just made it
a little too dark so you can go back in
over it and it's going to help the
blending effect even more as well going
back into the mega Pro palette and
picking up the color stone again I'm
just going to shade our cheeks even more
concentrating on and keeping everything
above the line clean and just shading
great below it
here I dipped my pencil brush in that
same color stone that we shaded it out
with and I'm just running it along the
edge to make it nice and crisp going
back in with a matte black shadow I'm
going to hollow out the inner corners
again this is a lot of layering so I do
a lot of the steps just over again to
build the intensity up and I'm also
going to bring it into the crease of my
eye and then blend it out with a large
fluffy brush
taking the color white from the most
recognized flash palette I'm going to
use this to mute out my brow so I'm just
taking an angle brush and running it
through the hairs taking a matte black
shadow again I'm going to just run this
underneath my lower lash line and then
buff it all out taking this muted dead
green color again I'm going to highlight
my face with it and then I decided that
I just wanted to cover my whole face in
this green color because like I said it
gave off like a really good dead rotting
kind of look so that's all we're doing
here is covering our entire face
then I'm just gonna set my whole face
with ven knives neutral set taking a
mixture of dark Browns and red Browns
I'm just going to use this to contour
even more so I'm going to bring it up
into my hairline and then just go over
our cheekbones to intensify the color
even more
taking that green once more I'm going to
go over our late text chin
taking the color stone once again I'm
gonna use this to shade around my
nostrils and underneath my lip so taking
the matte black shadow once more I'm
going to use it to blend out the liquid
liner that I applied I didn't want such
a perfect liner so I'm just taking a
pencil brush and smudging that all out
and then we're going to apply false
lashes these are just from the Halloween
store and they were actually really
difficult again to apply so now it's
time to start lifting up our latex and
all I'm doing is pinching right at the
bottom of it so that I can get my
fingers in there and then pulling it up
just take your time with this because
you don't want to rip your latex you
just want to slightly get it off your
chin so that you're able to roll it up
and it looks like rolled up skin
taking red from the flash palette I'm
going to place this all over my real
Chen and then up onto the latex that you
can actually see the folded over part
and then we're gonna go back into our
flash palette we're gonna pick up the
black shade and then I'm going to run
this between the latex and my chin just
for shading seeing the color stone once
more and a little teeny tiny brush I'm
going to start mapping out my veins I do
go over these a couple time with a brown
color and then at the end we'll go over
them with a liquid liner it's just
easier to start with a light shadow so
if you make a mistake it's easy to
correct
and then I just like to tap over it to
make sure that they're blended and it
just doesn't look like shadow resting on
your face it looks like it's actually
underneath your skin going back in with
a combo of these colors I'm just going
to use this to contour my face even more
my favorite part the blood I'm gonna
take Ben Nyes fresh scab and use this
first I love this blood it's like so
realistic and it's super super thick so
when you put it on its gonna stay on and
it looks better once it's dried it gives
like that scabby effect to it so I'm
gonna start with this all over my chin
and up onto the latex and then I'm going
to go in with my Ron's coagulated blood
which is just like this gel blood that
has a nice real effect to it as well and
it's going to stay in place where you
put it and just look super realistic
which I love now wouldn't be a Halloween
tutorial if I didn't use my snazaroo
face paint right so I'm going to use
this all over my neck because my neck
was just not matching with my face and
then I'm going to go in with some Brown
shadows and just kind of contour my
collarbones just to make me look like
deadly ish I also went in with that
greenish deadly color and place that
over my neck as well but I don't know
where those clips are so then after that
I'm going to go in with some more of the
Ben Nye fresh scat blood and I'm just
going to place this around my ears
because I didn't want her to look cute
at all then I'm going to take this fake
dirt this is called soot I have the
whole name listed in the bottom bar and
I'm going to run this all over my neck
and chest area the fingerprints kind of
gave it a cool effect like it looked
like I was bruised and whatnot so I'm
just going to blend this in all over my
neck
then taking any felt tip liner I use
this to draw veins all over my neck I
felt like a vein Pro at this point so I
didn't feel the need to go over it with
the shadow so I just drew those bad boys
right on and veins are super easy just
draw lots of squiggly lines coming off
of squiggly lines and I'm also going to
go back to my face and just intensify
all the veins on my face as well
now for some drippy blood this is just
blood that I found at the Halloween
store I'm going to squeeze this on to my
chin so it kind of gives a little runny
effect
so after that I popped in some contacts
and as you can see I have one kind of
red eye but I ended up not liking it and
I liked the clear ones way better so we
are going to switch that moving onto the
lips I'm gonna take our deadly green
again and just cover my in Tyre mouth
with this and then we're going to go
back in with our matte black shadow and
we're going to run this right in the
center of our mouth to give us a nice
dead mouth and you can use this look for
other things besides little red
riding-hood should be a great zombie in
my opinion all you have to do now is
throw on a Red Hood and Little Red
Riding Hood is complete so that is it
for this video I hope you guys enjoyed I
don't have anything else to say except I
love you guys thanks so much for
watching and until next time I will talk
to you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
