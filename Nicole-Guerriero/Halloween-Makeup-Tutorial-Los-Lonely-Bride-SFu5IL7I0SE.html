so excited to be getting up my first
Halloween tutorial this is a Los Lonely
bride I couldn't decide if I want her to
be angry or sad so I gave her a little
mix of both so jumping in I'm going to
prep my face I'm going to do this first
by using benefits Porefessional and then
i'm going to go in with a lighter
foundation just for a little bit of
extra coverage as opposed to just using
a white base paint so the foundation I'm
using is going to be about three shades
four shades lighter if you want to use
the white face paint on its own go right
ahead
next taking a white face paint and a dry
kind of like a Beauty Blender sponge
we're going to hit all the high points
of our face so that they are more
accentuated the great thing about this
makeup look is you can use it for any
kind of zombie vampire dead person
anything like that it's a basic
universal dead person look haha so after
we get all the high points of our face
set I'm going to go in with a powder
this is from Ben Nye neutral set and I'm
just going to set everything in place
next I'm priming my lids you don't have
to do this but if you're going to use
kind of like a grease paint or anything
like that it's just smarter so that you
don't have tons of creasing throughout
the night then I'm going to go in with
the color warm taupe from uh necessity
of Beverly Hills and I'm going to start
contouring my face so I'm going to do
these sockets of my lids I'm going to do
my cheeks down the bridge of my nose and
a little bit under my lip we're gonna go
back and forth with contouring I just
like to lay down a lighter color before
we go in with the really dark colors
here I'm just rounding out the contour
around my cheek area so that those
apples of our cheeks really pop forward
taking the makeup forever flash palette
I'm going to go in with the black color
you can use a black face paint and we're
just going to pack this all over our lid
and then we're going to take a blending
brush that has no product on it and work
that product all over our lid and then
you get like this nice gray color here
but I wanted her eyes to be very dark so
I'm going to go in with a black shadow
the shadow I'm using is from Anasazi of
Beverly Hills and sorry I didn't point
to it but it's the black one in the
palette and it is the color noir and I'm
just packing that all over the lid to
intensify the darkness blending
everything out there's no extra product
on this brush I just want everything to
be nice and smooth and I'm really
concentrating a lot of the color right
underneath my brow to make our eyes look
nice and sunken in and of course just
take a bigger blending brush and fluff
everything out
back to the makeup forever flash palette
I'm going to take the red paint color
it's just like a grease paint and I'm
going to pack this on the center of my
lid and then blend it out with the brush
that has no extra product on it just to
give a little more dimension in color in
the eyes as opposed them just being like
jet-black this is a great way to make
your eyes kind of look like bruise and
just dark but not black going in with
the white color from the flash palette
I'm going to use this in my brows
because my brows were just a little too
intense for me I did go back in with
brown but apparently I didn't film it so
I just went in with brown and white to
give them kind of an old aged look
going back into the flash palette I'm
just picking up black and running this
underneath my lash line and in my
waterline feel free to use an eyeliner I
just didn't have one handy and then
after that I'm just going to take a
pencil brush and smooth everything out
taking the color rich brown I'm going to
use a fluffier brush and start dragging
the color down into the kind of bag
region to make us look dark and tired
and dead
going into my 120 palette from BH
Cosmetics I'm going to pick up the red
color and just dust it lightly on the
center of our lids and then we're also
going to run it underneath our lower
lash line as well just dragging this
color down so it's like a gradient
effect I'm going to go back into the 120
palette and just get a mixture of the
Browns and there any Brown will do and
then just put this right underneath the
red blending the two together
going in with the colored concrete from
Mac we go back and start contouring and
hollowing out our face a little more so
I'm just packing that color on right
into the center of where my eye and the
bone of my nose means how do I describe
that area obviously you see what I'm
doing and I'm just going to darken this
up and contour the nose even more then
going back with a neutral set from Ben
Nye I'm just running this around the
areas that we just applied the brown in
the red to underneath the eyes it just
blends and smooths everything out going
back in with the color rich brown I'm
going to use this to start intensifying
the contours around our face so we're
going to do our cheeks our temples our
chin and just kind of blend on the nose
a little taking our white facepaint I'm
just going to intensify any areas that I
feel like don't look really white
so just underneath our contours and I'm
going to take it down my neck and hit my
ears and everything like that
taking me color deep brown from
Anastacio i am going to intensify the
contours even more and for this I'm just
using a smaller fluffy brush so we get a
really defined cheekbone if you guys can
tell the difference how this side is
popping out way more
then I just took another contour brush
and wanted to blend everything out to
make sure there's no harsh lines mm-hmm
taking 134 lat Dell we're going to pop
those babies on because even from the
grave i'ma still rock the lash head okay
for the lips I'm going to use a night
moth's from Mac and I'm going to extend
my upper lip a lot at first and then I
realize okay it's just a little too much
for me so you'll see that I'll go back
and kind of shorten the length but if
you want to rock it the long way that I
originally have it girl you do it just
kind of gives you that more creepy kind
of look so after you line your lips
you're just going to want to fill them
in
and then I just took a red lipstick and
pop that into the center but I do go
over it with night moth to just darken
everything up and make him more scary so
ya see how long it is I'm about to fix
that right now and make it a little
shorter and just I feel like it goes
better with the look with the wings
being a little shorter on the lips
nothing says dead like white contacts so
I'm gonna pop in these are innocent
white from Desio eyes because my
Halloween contacts haven't gotten here
yet but these will suffice I'm gonna go
in with our white facepaint again and
then just apply this all over our hands
so that we blend better with our face
see better right so this makeup is
complete now I'm gonna go change into my
outfit before we get bloody
so I just found this costume online and
I threw on a black wig because I really
felt like it completed her you can
totally leave her makeup as is but I
love a little blood for Halloween so I'm
just going to use some q-tips and a
little fake blood and just create some
sad crying lonely tears
and then I went ahead and just eNOS
weird some blood on me I also went in
with this plains dust from Ben Nye and
sprinkled this all over my chest and on
my hands to give me that you know
rolling around in the graveyard look
this stuff is amazing but after that
this look is totally complete so I hope
you guys enjoyed my first Halloween
tutorial oh you know you got to slather
a little more blood on and then she's
done so I don't have anything else to
say except I love you guys thank you so
much for watching I hope you have sweet
dreams and until next time I will talk
to you guys soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
