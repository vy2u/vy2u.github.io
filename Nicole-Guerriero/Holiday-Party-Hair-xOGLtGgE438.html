this hairstyle you could use this for
holiday parties you could use it for New
Year's Eve I just wanted something that
was still down but still kind of
glamorous and fun but kind of out of
your face as well so this is what I came
up with I love the big pouf in the back
it's just like 60s to me so I am in my
room I'm just sitting like backwards
from how I used to because I just wanted
to use those little streamers that I
have in the background for this tutorial
yeah it's super easy and I absolutely
love it you know you don't have to make
your pouf as this as big as I made mine
but I have a rather large head so I have
to kind of you know balance everything
out alright guys
yeah I don't think I have anything to
say so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you want to see how to get this
hair then just keep watching thanks guys
oh hello again so the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to clip in my
hair and boom just like that power of
editing it's in the next thing I'm going
to do is pick out what one size I'm
going to use I want a really loose curl
for this so I'm going to be using my
thirty two millimeter you could use
something like a one and a half two inch
curling iron and you will be good to go
so I'm just going to section everything
off and then I'm going to brush it out I
did already spray my hair with a heat
protectant I was just using the Tresemme
one I always forget to put that in and
then again I'm just brushing everything
out so that there's no nuts and we are
then going to curl everything facing
towards our face I got stuck on my words
there did you notice and then I'm just
going at to it let the curl fall into my
hand and kind of squeeze it out and let
it set there you can go ahead and pin
these curls but like I said I wanted a
really loose curl so I'm not gonna pin
them this time
so you guys pretty much know the drill
with curling our hair so I'm just going
to throw some too fast for and then so
then after you're done curling
everything it should be looking
something like this but this is just too
nice for me so we're going to add some
texture to it by using some dry shampoo
and I am just spraying tons and tons of
this in my hair because I actually have
freshly washed hair so yeah I'm just
loading in a new dry shampoo
next I'm just sectioning out the hair
that will not be up in the poof and then
we're gonna move right on to teasing so
I am just taking really small sections
and then spraying them and then I'm
teasing at the back of the hair and the
front of the hair just so it's more like
knotty and teased so just take your time
with this and go in really small pieces
and you don't have to pull really hard
you just want to push down and make sure
you get a nice little cushion at the
base of your hair next I'm just
smoothing everything back and we're
going to pull it back into kind of a
half up-down situation so if you wanted
to use a small elastic it would be
better but it happening so that's why I
had to use that huge one and of course
just keep smoothing it out to your
desired liking if you're super
particular this may take you some time
but everything does smooth itself out
eventually just try not to put your T's
out too much so once we have everything
is secured I just like to start tugging
on it just for added oomph in the hair
and then I like to lift it all and bobby
pin it in that upward position I also
did place a hair clip underneath where I
secured it but I totally didn't film it
so my bad but by adding a clip
underneath everything will just add
extra volume to your look
and then this step is totally optional
but you know me I like to tease I just
feel like it finishes the look off but
if you like a more smooth look you can
totally skip this and then I'm just hair
spraying it so the volume will stay in
my hair but if you don't want any hair
in your face you can simply just pull
your bangs back and a bobby pin it back
into the pouf and then you can recur any
pieces that you see fit like I do the
one's kind of by the sides of my ear
because those lose the curl the fastest
so then after that everything is
complete I hope you guys enjoyed this
holiday hair tutorial let me know if you
try it out or better yet tag me on
Instagram so I love you guys until next
time I will talk to you guys soon right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
