do a makeup tutorial kind of get back on
track on doing regular makeup and not
Halloween makeup even though I feel like
I kind of want to do like crazy looks
like that kind of throughout the year if
you guys are cool with that because I
never get to do crazy looks like that I
never practice my Halloween looks
whenever I do crazy makeup like that I
haven't done it for a whole year so I
always feel kind of rusty um so I think
I'm gonna be incorporating more like
creative looks into my channel I just
woke up so don't mind me today I want to
do a kind of dramatic holiday look I
want to do a lot of holiday looks this
year the one I'm going to start with
today I want to kind of do like a green
look I don't know why I know why I got
the lorac pro 2 palette and in here is
this really beautiful like matte green
shade which is right here it's called
forest so I wanted to use that as like
my main focus point of the look and then
just go from there the only thing that I
know that I'm gonna do is have green
eyes I don't know what lip I'm gonna do
if we could do like a nude lip or maybe
like a burgundy lip with it maybe we'll
do like two lip options I'm gonna talk
through it a little bit and then do kind
of music playing through the rest
because whenever I try to do talk
through videos or like 40 minutes long
and we can't be having 40 minute long
videos all the time so I'm trying to get
better at my talk through because I know
that you guys like talk videos better
than voiceovers I don't know I think
it's like 50/50 some of you like
voiceovers and some of you like talk
throughs I personally like voiceovers
because when I'm doing my makeup I kind
of forget to talk and I listen to music
but when I do my talk throughs I can't
listen to any music okay so I just want
to clip my hair out of the way so I'm
going to prep my face first I go between
two moisturizers usually when I'm
moisturizing my face are the Clinique
dramatically different moisturizing gel
and the Bobbi Brown vitamin-enriched
face face it's usually just whatever I'm
feeling more if I want more of like dewy
skin which I get dewy skin pretty
normally because I'm oily I go with the
dramatically different write
dramatically different moisturizing gel
and if I just want to moisturize out my
face but I don't want to get so dewy so
fast I'll go with the vitamin enriched
which is what I'm going to use today and
this dress is open back I'm wearing a
dress and my I have my hair in today so
it's like tickling my back I don't like
it so I just pop it on my face like this
and then work it in
it smells like so fresh and so clean
okay so I'll just let that soak in for a
second I'm going to prep my lips with my
best damn lip mask if you guys have
ordered a lip mask and you haven't got
it yet don't worry it will be on your
way soon this is just like one of our
most popular items and you guys order
these like cry see I can't read about
this I can't if I could change this lip
mask and do anything different to it
what would you guys want to see I know
that you guys want to see a clear one so
we might be working on that but if you
could change this what would you change
about it let me know in the comments
down below if you've tried it so I'm
just going to still let this sink in
before I put on my primer I just love
how late it makes your skin look so
healthy right away Dini beans while this
is soaking in I just want to let you
guys know that I will be giving you a
tour of this room so that you can see
why I film here when I do my makeup
tutorials and why I will be filming at
the vanity when I do like talking videos
for you guys and I will also show you
what I used to film on when I did makeup
tutorials and you'll be like wow okay
now I see why you have the big desk so
um just give me a second I wanted to try
to get it up for you guys tomorrow
but the days move so quick but I
definitely want to get it up for you
before I leave for LA on Monday so
sometime between Friday and Monday I
will have a tour up of this room so that
you guys can see what's going on in here
and again why I film here when I do
makeup videos so for primer I'm going to
use my makeup forever skin equalizer I
honestly think this is the best primer
I've ever used this is the smoothing one
I haven't tried any of the other ones
from this skin equalizer line I I know
there's a bunch but this one just
happens to be my favorite again this one
is smoothing I just put it really in the
areas that I feel are like my problem
areas mainly on the cheek egde for me
for foundation I'm going to use my
L'Oreal True Match and n3i talked about
it my favorites I am back to using a
L'Oreal True Match I personally just
think it's the best foundation that I've
ever ever used I just think it makes you
look healthy yeah luminous I'm going to
put it on first with a foundation brush
and then we're going to blend it out
with a damp Beauty Blender
so then after my brows are on I like to
take a little bit of translucent powder
this is the secret brightening powder
from Laura Mercier you can use whatever
you'd like and I just like to run this
on my eye because I put foundation on my
lids so I just like to put a little
powder down to kind of get rid of that
stickiness so that my shadows won't drag
so I'm going to do a little bit of a
crease color first and I'm using the
color tawny and then this is a morphe
504 brush and I'm gonna put this in the
crease just a little bit
then taking a Mac 242 I'm pretty sure
it's a 242 the numbers actually rubbed
off we're going to go in with forest
which is just this beautiful West
Chester Hsieh with which just is like
this beautiful matte green for a screen
for screen actually used to be like one
of my favorite colors when I was like a
little kid I always remember they're
like what's your favorite color Mike
forest green mmm and I'm going to pack
this onto the lid
just taking my time and as I'm packing
it on I am just pushing it into my eye
but I'm not bringing the brush off of my
lid like I'm not packing it on like this
like I'm packing it on but I'm keeping
it on my eyelid and then I'm going to
take this cute little morphe 5:07 brush
and start to diffuse that crease or
diffuse the edges
taking that same Sigma e25 I'm just
going to use that to blend more okay so
he's not looking as green as I wanted it
to look so I think I'm going to add a
little bit of shimmer to it just looking
at it here it doesn't even look green it
looks like black so I'm going to use
these makeup geek duochrome shadows
these are their newer shadows I was
talking about the matte shadows on my
snapchat and I was saying I couldn't
find the shimmery shadows and I was
actually referring to these duochrome
shadows so I think I'm going to use this
green right here which is so fun to pop
out and get nails OOP got it and the
color is called typhoon so I'm just
going to use the same brush I have this
little a color switch and so all you do
is you can just run your brush in here
and it'll take off all the shadow so as
you can keep using the same brush if you
light
so much fell out of my nose I do still
want to try to do like a matte green
look it's just that was not looking
green what so a BA
so we're going to do mascara winged
liner false lashes now
so my camera wasn't filming when I
thought it was I love what it does that
but really quick what I did I just set
my face with Studio Fix powder and NC 35
and this is a pro airbrush from support
sapporo from sephora and i just like to
set my makeup with a powder foundation
just so it adds a little bit of extra
coverage and also i like to add the
powder to my face before i contour my
face because I like my contour to lay on
top of a powder instead of my contour to
lay on top of my foundation because if I
don't set my face and I just have the
foundation on my face and I try to
contour it can be like a little drag e
so by setting your face with some kind
of powder it doesn't have to be a powder
foundation if you don't want extra
coverage it can be a translucent powder
but if you set your foundation before
you contour it will make your contour
going a lot smoother so now let's come
to our face I'm going to use this shade
and light palette and I'm going to use
the color subconscious it's like my
favorite I'm going to start with this
makeup geek chiseled cheek brush
and then switch to the Real Techniques
contour brush and then not so much
because I like to bake but more so
because I just like to have a clean
contour line I take a little bit of the
Ben Nye powder in cameo you can use
banana and then just a little cosmetic
wedge and then I'm just going to use
this to clean out my contour otherwise I
feel like it just starts to like I don't
get muddy or something
it just really helps me and clean up my
contour line I'll fire a little bit of
flesh I'm going to use Melba quick Melba
and then for highlight today I'm going
to use honest hacia in dry when he's so
Hollywood yeah it's so Hollywood and I
finally found my little Anasazi Oh like
highlight brush I thought it was like
lost forever I need to go get my nails
done so there
you see what I mean you'll see what I
mean now I'm going to take a stippling
brush and you can get rid of your bacon
and then go over your highlight just to
kind of blend it in with everything we
are almost done we are almost done so
then I'm gonna take it a little bit more
of that typhoon which is the real Chrome
shadow that we use on our lid and we're
gonna do a little bit underneath our
yeah I honestly don't know why I have to
make crazy faces when I work underneath
my eye but I must oh this is why I don't
put stuff on my lower lash line because
I can't stand it getting in my eye they
take a more fluffy brush I'm gonna
diffuse that now we can add mascara to
our lower lashes there's so much all eye
shadow in my ally I'm the speed so close
to the mirror watch other videos or
people are just like eight feet away
from a mirror putting on their lower
their mascara on their lower lashes and
I'm like how are you doing that
how this is actually really far away
from me I have bad eyes like I do wear
prescription glasses which I need to go
to the eye doctor cuz I broke my glasses
i sat on them like what oh good oh good
new little final touches I'm just going
to set the brows and then we are on
slips what do you think we should do
should we do like a new lip should we do
like a colorful lip so I think the first
look that we're going to try is a nude
lip and I'm going to use Reesie from the
Omri Z lip land collection and the the
color is called reezy I'm going to line
my lips first and I'm going to boldly
bear it then go in with garlic
so here is the look with the Ariza lip
it is completely dry I really like how
it looks just keep it nice and simple
with a nude lip if you're doing a
colorful eye I am going to try a darker
lip in a second but when I wear nude
lips I like to have a little bit of
dimension so I'm going to take this sext
from melt cosmetics
when I wear a nude lip I just like it to
have a little bit of dimension I don't
like just be one color so you can
achieve that either by a darker lip
liner or by adding a lighter nude
lipstick to the center of your lip just
to kind of make it pop a little more
so here's the final look with the nude
lip I really like how it turned out I am
a little bummed though that it wasn't
the matte green that I wanted to go for
originally I'm gonna hunt through my
shadows and try to find a perfect matte
green that will actually look green and
not transform myself into like a black
shadow but here is the look with the
nude lip and then here it is with
Montenegro I actually really like how it
looks with the dark lip I like both the
nude lip and the dark lip the new lip is
the more safe route and the darker lip
is the more badass thug life or alec
because usually with colored shadows you
try to keep everything you know toned
down but actually don't mind it actually
really like how it looks
let me know what lip you guys were that
would you wear the nude lip or the
darker lip or would you wear both lips
with it just depending on I guess where
you would be going so that is it for
this video I hope you guys enjoyed again
I'm going to try my hardest to get a
room tour up for you guys before I leave
for LA so I don't think I have anything
else to tell you guys except I love you
