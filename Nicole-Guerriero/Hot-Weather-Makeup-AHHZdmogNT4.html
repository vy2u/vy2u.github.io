I wear when it is hot outside and I'm
actually going it to be outside most of
the time it's really hot in Florida
anyway
and the makeup that I usually wear is a
full face but that's because I know I'm
going to be inside air-conditioned this
is the kind of makeup I wear when I know
I'm going to be outside for a long
period of time like if I'm going to a
theme park or from going to a baseball
game or something like that so I don't
like to do too much because I know that
it's just going to melt right off of my
face
and also I did have a little trouble
filming this outside because the Sun was
not on my side Oh No so hopefully it
came out okay and yeah so if you guys
want to see how to get this hot with her
face then just keep watching the video
instead hey
oh cool now we have ambulances
perfect okay starting with our face I'm
going to be using an anti sign
mattifying gel this one's from Yves
pearl and I'm going to put this all over
my t-zone - you know soak up the shrine
eNOS moving on I'm going to use a little
bit of foundation just to even out my
skin tone this is just what I'm most
comfortable with I don't really like
tinted moisturizers or BB creams but if
you wanted to use something like that go
right ahead so I'm just going to do a
little bit and then I'm going to blend
everything out with a damp Beauty
Blender so for powders I either go with
a powder foundation or translucent
powder when I'm going to be outside
today the translucent powder is winning
and this is just preppin prime from Mac
and yeah you can't even see me putting
it on because I'm such a great
videographer moving on to concealer I'm
just going it to use fake up from
benefit this is a hydrating creaseless
concealer I'm just going it to mix the
light and the medium colors together and
I'm also going to blend this out with a
Beauty Blender
now I'm gonna fill in my eyebrows just a
little bit and by a little bit I do mean
a little bit I have pretty dramatic
brows anyway but I'm just going to shape
them and fill in any sparse areas so
it's checking to see if my eyelids were
a little oily and they were so I'm just
want to hit them with a little bit of
translucent powder moving on I'm going
to use these two flashes the first one
is pink spoon for Mac and the other one
is Dulce pink from Milani so I'm just
going to mix those two together to give
me a nice pinky glow to my cheeks
you know the deal with the mascara I'm
gonna load on a bunch so first one
second one I'm on that which one this is
but I like to load on a bunch
don't forget those lower lashes next I'm
gonna mix these two super pinky
lipsticks together because I really like
to have a bright lip when I don't have a
lot of other makeup on I don't know it
just makes me feel more sassy so I'm
just gonna mix these two Pink's together
I love mixing my lipsticks because it
just gives a little something extra and
lastly you're going to want to set your
makeup with some kind of setting spray
and do not forget your blotting papers
at home so other than that our hot
weather makeup look is complete I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and until
next time I will talk to you guys soon
