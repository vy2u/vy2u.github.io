so today we are going to do - I don't know if I'm gonna call it a hair tutorial
because it's not - I dont know if it's a tutorial
it's just basically what I do to kinda refresh
restyle and volumize my bedhead
because this is usually what I look like when I wake up in the morning
the hair not the face
this is basically howI style my hair like 90% of the time
and because I have
color treated hair and I have a fashion color in my hair
being this purple
um I don't really like to wash my hair alot because
I'm trying to prolong the color. If
you have colorful hair or if you've ever had colorful hair - you know that it is a lot
of upkeep and everytime you wash your hair you just
see your beautiful color running down the drain or in
my case it gets like stained onto your nails
again these nails used to be white and now they're purple
I probably wash my hair twice a week.. Again
that doesn't mean I'm not showering guys. I feel the need to say that
because whenever I say that I only wash my hair twice a week, people are like
&amp;quot;Oh my god!! You're not showering!&amp;quot; I'm like nah girl
I'm showering. I just, like, wear a shower cap or
if i dont have a shower cap, you can just put a plastic bag over your head
or sometimes I just put a towel on my head. Anything
to not get the hair wet. So I just thought I would show you guys what
I normally do since I have to do it anyway. Also if you guys are
feeling this makeup look today, I do have a very
very similar makeup tutorial that went up
I think last week or the week before that I will put in the
bottom bar for you guys. It is basically the exact look that I
was wearing in the video except I have a different lid color on
even though it looks the same
Ow.. but basically this entire face
is already in a video so I will link it in the bottom bar if you guys
wanna check that out. So lets get this hair looking a little better
then it looks right now. So this is our starting point
this messy ass ponytail
and dont get me wrong, you will catch me in Publix
rocking this ponytail but when I wanna look a little more
pulled together, I do this. So to start
we're gonna need to brush this hair
out. If you have extensions, you know you need to brush them regularly
because they do get naughty easily. This is the brush
that I use, it's from Marula oil
It is a wet brush but it works really good if you have bonded in
or tape-in hair extensions. This is not gonna pull on your hair
so I just need to brush this out before we do anything else
OKOK not bad after we brush it out but believe me
when I say that it needs some help. I know it's hard to tell
when I have this colorful hair but it is greasy
and it definitely needs all the dry shampoo it can get, so
my favorite dry shampoo currently is from moroccan oil
and this is a dark toned dry shampoo
I love it because it doesn't leave any kind of residue, it actually makes your hair
feel more clean so that's important
You can kinda see a little residue here
but all you need to do is work it in with your hands. This is gonna really help
absorb the oil and as you can see get rid of that little bit of
white cast. Now if you had dark hair, this would not happen to
you but I don't think they make purple dry shampoo - Hey now..
After you are all dry shampooed up, you're gonna wanna brush it through again
and now we're going to part our hair. We're just going to part
it right down the back of our head into just two sections.
This is just the easiest way I find to curl my hair.
This is the hot tools curling wand I'm going to use
It's extra long so it's good for long hair
I will have the heat protectant I'm using in the bottom bar
and I'm gonna curl pieces of my hair that are about this size
I'm also going to start a timer because when I
curl my own hair, I feel like
I do it super duper fast so I just wanted to see for myself how
fast I could actually curl my hair so this is me
setting the stopwatch.
and yeah we're just gonna curl this hair - you can
curl it in opposite directions if you want, that's just gonna give you like a more
separated look but I just basically curl everything in the same
direction and this is going to give you more of a wave
and not a curl because we're just wrapping it around the barrel and
since this wand - well it's a
curling iron but I'm gonna call it a wand because that's how we're using it -
SInce it does get so hot, I only have to hold my hair
on the barrel for about three seconds which is a
definite plus.
Ohh shit 4:59 that feels
super fast to me
So after we're all curled, I'm just gonna brush everything out again
I just like it to be more uhh
together instead of you know all the way separated so that's why I brush it through
and this is fine if you wanna leave it as is I mean this is pretty too but
I like to have a little more volume in the hair
I feel like it makes it
last longer so it doesn't look super flat right away so what
I do is just take my brush that I brush my hair with, put it on the inside of my hair
and then just kind of back-comb it a little bit.
You're gonna wanna hold the ends of your hair pretty tight
as you do this and make sure you're going underneath
so it's not like looking super naughty but if it is looking a little
naughty or a little too messy for you, you can go over and just like brush the
top lightly to make it look a little more smooth
and look at the difference already
and I back-combed it like three or four times but
volume - no volume, volume
So you can back-comb as much as you want you know
get it as big as you want but this is pretty good for me and then I just usually
tuck it behind the ear so that it's not like super overpowering
to my face
So that is it, that is how I do my hair. It only
took me four minutes and fifty nine seconds
it only took me four minutes and fifty nine seconds
to curl the hair. Maybe an extra
two minutes to style it so seven
minutes to do your hair I feel is like key.
This guy definitely makes a difference in
the curling time because I feel like it's so hot you only
have your hair on the wand for about three seconds and
you're good to go. I feel like that's where the majority of
curling your hair gets like tedious having to hold your
hair there for more than three seconds so
three seconds you're good to go and boom you are out the door so
that is it for me guys. I hoped you enjoyed and I will see you in the next
video.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
