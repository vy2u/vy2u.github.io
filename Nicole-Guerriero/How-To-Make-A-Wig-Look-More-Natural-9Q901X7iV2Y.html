I'm gonna show you guys how I put on my pink wig
that so many of you had questions about so many of you didn't believe that it was a wig it was definitely a wig um
so yeah
I just wanted to show you guys how I put my wigs on how I make them look a little more natural
like I honestly don't see the difference in wearing a wig and wearing hair extensions like
It's the same thing in my opinion a lot of people though
It's not their same opinion
But I see a lot more people wearing wigs and I'm excited about it and so many of you were gassed up about this pink
Wig that you were like show us what you did, so I was like yay
We're excited about the wigs I have a very extensive wig collection. Maybe one day I will show you guys um
I love wigs I think they're great for protective styling like if you've got damaged hair
And you just don't want to do a lot to your hair
You just want to kind of give it a break
I think wigs are great for that because you're just kind of hiding your hair underneath, but you still look cute on the outside
So a lot of my wigs are fun funky colors because I mean I do have natural wigs too
But a lot of them are fun funky colors because me personally I wish I could have different hair every single day length
Texture color everything so wigs to me are super fun. They're expressive and again
They are just a safe way to do your hair especially if you have damaged hair
So just keep that in mind
my hair is just still up for when i was just doing my makeup because I was
like I'm just gonna throw a wig  on anyways, so I'm not gonna
do my hair for this video
um
But it is a little bit harder for me to put in my wigs because I have a lot of hair currently
Because they- I have tape and extensions, but I'm getting my tape ins taken out on Saturday today is
Wednesday um
So it'll be a lot easier for me to
Put my wigs on and not have to worry about like
Really getting my hair down to my head cuz I can't bring my hair down to my head because I have tape and extensions
So let me show you guys the wig just in case you didn't believe me. This is her right here
I got her from a local beauty supply
Store if you live in the same heat clearwater area the beauty supply store that I go to for all my wigs
It's called Sunny's beauty mart. It's off central and it is wig
Heaven they have so many wigs and you can try the wigs on for like a dollar you can try out
I think like five wigs for a dollar they gotta make their money, too
So she is a synthetic wig which means she's not made out of human hair
But she is a heat-safe synthetic wig
Which means you can straighten it you can curl it the curls that you see in
Here are already from the wig it was a lot shorter when I got it because the curls were a lot tighter
But I just consistently brushed the wig so that it gives it a little bit more length [um]
most of my colored wigs do have roots on them so that I am able to blend my natural hair in with the
Wigs just keep that in mind if you want to get like a funky color
Try to get one that has a little bit of root action happening
She is a lace front wig but I've already cut the lace off obviously
because I've worn her and I've added a little bit of a
Concealer to her scalp um I used powder
I'm gonna show you what I do today
just in case you've never put on a wig or you've never seen somebody put on a wig themselves uh
I did scour the internet this is not a sponsored video
I just have to say that out first because I see you guys in the comments
But I did Scour the internet
And I found what I think is this exact wig when I buy my wigs from the beauty mart they just kind of make up
A price on the spot, there's no tags on them
There's no nothing so they can charge you whatever they want
So I think I found this exact wig and I will link it in the bottom bar for you guys
And it's only like 35 bucks 30 or 40 bucks
If it's not this exact wig it's pretty damn close flow whoo. Why why why [oh]?
okay, so like I said I have a lot of hair to put up so I just kind of try to get my hair as
Tight down to my head as I possibly can I'm going to part my hair for us because we're going to put the wig on
First just as it is so I'm going to just part my hair
like pretty much how the wig is parted is a side part on the wig so that works and then I'm just going to
Leave some hair out like the perimeter of my hair. I don't need a lot
just a little bit
I like to wear them like half-up half-down um so I need a little bit of my own hair so that it looks
more natural
You can do this after you put your wig cap on, but I just do it beforehand
I'm just going to get my hair
in
to the nape of my neck [and]
Then we're gonna. I'm going to tie it in a hair tie as low as I can on my neck
all right, and then I'm just going to split it into two and then take this piece and
Bobby pin it down with this
pin this down
Okay, so now that we have our hair
Just like as flat as I'm going to get it for the time being you can put on your wig cap
So I just start mine rate where my hair leave at is [alright] like where that little part is is where my wig cap goes?
I'm having flashbacks to my purple alien laughs alright, so once [more]
We cap is on we can put on our wig
So I'm just going to take her off my styrofoam head I get these from Amazon
They're like
Two dollars I buy them in bulk. I usually buy them by like six and [for] six. It's like
I don't know like less [than] ten bucks
If you've never put on a wig before or you don't really know about wigs
How you have how you secure the wig to your head is you clip it in like you slide these clips into your head
So this week has three it has one at the nape of the neck and then it has two here at the side
You can see them right there
What you want to make [sure] when you put your wig on is you're paying [attention] to where your clips are so when you go?
To like slide it in you can just reach under and grab it and put it in place
[that's] a mistake that I've
kind of Learned
through putting on Wigs I
Would forget where they were and then I try to grab them and I'd be sliding all over the place
So just keep in mind where your clips are so that it's easier for you
and then you also have these little straps here in the back that you [can] use to adjust it to make your wig smaller or
Larger for your head. Thank you
Put it like in a bucket like this like upside down
And then I put my head into it that vic sent to see you guys
So this is just the wig sitting on my head
It's not clipped into place yet, so I'm just going to start adjusting it all right
So I'm just going to clip this into place slide it into place
So I have my clip here in my hand so push that in
There other one is here
Okay, okay
[now] gonna be a bit of brush again okay? So here's our [wade] just on. I haven't done anything special to it
I've just basically put it on and I think it looks pretty natural
Already just because this is the front of my natural [hairline], [so] it's just kind of disguising the wig
But if you don't want to leave your natural hair out
You don't have to you can [definitely] wear the wig all the way to the front's of your parts
[I] just think that this way it kind of gives it more of an illusion of actually being your hair
So what I'm going to do now is I'm just going it to lighten up this part as you can see my part is pretty
White and the wig just it's it's just not
So what I like to do is I like to use actually powder instead of a cream concealer
But you can use either or you just want to make sure that you're using something. [that's] pretty close to your natural skin tone
So I'm using my face powder that I usually use to set my face with and I'm just using a flat brush
Which kind of just fits perfectly in to here?
So I'm just going to go over that line
then
It's just all the way back. I'm also going to put the powder on my natural scalp
So that it all just blends with each other
just rub your finger over it, so
It looks a little more natural
You can't go in and pluck hairs out, but no I've done that before and I just think that this is easier
Okay
So I'm going to be pulling the hair up on this wig, but if I were to wear this wig down
I just wanted to show you guys
so you can kind of see like a little bald spot here because that's exactly where the wig cap and the wig start so it's
Kind of pulling my hair so what I do if I wear the wig down is I just take some brow powder
Like a darker color and I come in here, [and] I'll just fill this in with powder
So you're not able to see where your hair starts and the wig starts and again that is why I like my colorful wigs to
Have a little bit of root with them. So it just it's a lot
It's a [lot] easier to blend your hair with [it], so I'm just going to pull my hair
That I left out
We're just going to pull that back with the wig hair you want to be careful because you [don't] want to pull it up
So much that you see like how the wig is attached
and then this just gives the illusion that the
[hair] is [just] all coming out of your own head and just keep messing with it. You may have to
Pull it up and pull [it] down a few times until you get it to where you want
And it's not like you know major [traction] or anything like that
[and] then you're just going to want to secure it with a hair tie
Give it a good tug, and then just brush this out [too] like I said it gets knotty easily
So you can just keep messing with it
You can hit it with a curling iron if you want it to kind of change its [shape]
I just [usually] just mess with the hair because it is synthetic hair
So when you mess with a dough just it
Usually just ends up doing what you want if you just keep messing with it enough
You can also take this hairstyle, and you can wear it
Like in a topknot so all you have to do is just basically do it. How you usually do it
It's just easier if you give this hair a little bit of a twist
So it's not just super flat and then you can just wrap it around
But you can also wear [it] in the top nap if you don't want to like where the waterfall spouts or whatever
but I
Like the waterfalls family and then my final step that [I] like to do is I just like to brush all my baby hairs down
So it doesn't look like so just like slappy in here, so I just take a toothbrush
I actually sell these from the w when I go
I always ask for them to give me [a] toothbrush because it's like the best baby hair toothbrush ever and I'm just gonna take a
Little bit of some paste. This is actually Jeremy's paste
Don't tell them and then I'm just going it to get these baby hairs to Lay a little flatter
On my head, I see people like laser their baby hairs off
And I'm just [like] why would anybody get rid of their baby hairs like I?
No, no, no
So that is how I do it that's how I applied my wigs to make them look just a little bit more natural
[I] mean in my opinion, but if anybody was like are you wearing away? I'd be like yes. Yes
I am and you want to know where I got it. Don't you so I hope you guys enjoy it
I hope you try out just trying on wigs remember with anything practice makes perfect
I mean, I really [want] [to] make my own wigs now. I just think wigs are too fun
To not wear all the time so again. I hope you guys [enjoyed]
I hope you try it out if you do tag me on Instagram send to me on Twitter. [I] want to see you and
Check the bottom bar again if you guys want to get this wig again
[I] don't know if it is the exact wig, but I feel like it [is] super duper similar to it so again
I hope you guys enjoy it. [I] don't have anything else to tell you guys except I love you
Thank you so much for watching and until next time I will talk to you guys soon. Bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
