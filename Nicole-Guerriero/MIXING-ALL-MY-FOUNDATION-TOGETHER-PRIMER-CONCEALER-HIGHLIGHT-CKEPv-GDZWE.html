Wait, I'm thirsty.
 
Hello and welcome back to my channel so today
We are going to be mixing all
32 of my foundations together
I'm not gonna lie one or two of them might be expired
I hope that they're not even though I consider myself somewhat of like a makeup
Hoarder because I just like to collect makeup even if I know some things like expired
I'm not gonna use it on my face. I just like to have it. I'm pretty good with like getting rid of
Foundations so I have a lot of foundations here
32 to be exact and I have four things that we're gonna mix all together
So we're gonna mix together all of my primers all of my concealers all of my foundations and all of my liquid
Highlights. I mainly just want it to do
products that were like liquidy to mix together because I don't want to be like digging in my powders or anything like that and
Let's be honest, I basically use the same bronzer and blush for everything so there's no point in just scratching
them alone. The first person's video that I watched mixing all their foundations together was Alissa Ashley. I absolutely love her
I think she's so
Stunning she's so sweet in person and her channel is really amazing so I will link her in the bottom bar for you guys to
Check her out, but the person that actually kind of made up this whole mixing all your foundations together
I will link her in the bottom bar as well
I just don't want to butcher her name because I know when people butcher my name. I'm just like oh
Ok so I don't want to butcher her so I will link her channel in the bottom bar as well
So you can check her out. I believe she was the first one that kind of started doing this because
Alissa mentioned in her video and I went and watched the other girl's video
After I was done watching Alissa, so I was like well
I have a lot of foundations, and I would love to see what they look like all mixed together
Basically every single one of them is a different color too, which is crazy
So hopefully we get something that
Somewhat looks good. If not hooray
for makeup wipes. I figured since my face was having a little bit of a breakout anyway
Why not go ahead and put 32 foundations on it?
Shall we get started
shall we
Shall we do this shall we do this thing shall we do the damn thing so I have these little glass jars that I got
From Michael's that I'm going to mix up in originally
I was just gonna do my foundation concealer and liquid highlights
But I realized that I had a bunch of primers
And I was like we should probably mix those - so we're gonna mix those and a bigger bowl
Yeah, so I'm gonna mix the products together first before we put them on our face, so let's start with the primers.
So the first guy added to the mix is from coverfx, and this is their blurring primer.

Like a seashell up there a okay you guys ready to see me put this on my face with an eye and already we're going
in first with our primer
Smells good like we look illuminated get in with these fingers stop playing around this brush
How's it feel hmm super soft like the softest I've ever felt my face
It doesn't have as much as like the silicone II feel I
was like normal but
It feels nice. We're on to foundation the most exciting part
Ready blemish you ain't ready oh
Whoa
I feel a little bit of a burn burn we're gonna take our beauty wonder and dab it out
That coverage though definitely gonna have to blend down the neck low to make it look more seamless, but Wow
Holy coverage
Surprisingly, it doesn't feel like super cakey on my face, and I feel like the color
Is not that bad for having 32 different shades. I mean some of them are close together, but you know like no foundations
Even if you get close like I can never match in color, so I am
Pretty impressed with our Frankenstein concoction, and you know i'ma keep it. You know
Hopefully we can get what we need out of this concealer situation. I feel like we can
Yeah, yeah
Okay, so that was cool. Yeah, so the consistency feels really nice going underneath the eyes
And the color doesn't look too bad
I'll just put a little in these places to get it off this brush when I first put them on I get a little bit
Of a burning sensation, which makes me nervous, but it went away
It's super quick when I put the foundation on, but I do kind of feel that same little tingly feeling
Blends out pretty good feels lightweight underneath the eyes considering that we mix
I think 14, was it 14 concealers together pretty impressed with our Frankenstein concealer mixture as well
So I'm just gonna contour my face. What is this looks like a hot dog?
Now it is time for our liquid highlight glow. I think we had
24 or 25 highlighters mixed in here so we're gonna grab some on a little duo fiber brush
And we're gonna add this to the high points of our cheeks
Whoa
Okay
Is the camera even doing you justice I feel like no. It's not I can't like describe the
Consistency of it, but it feels so good
I am thoroughly impressed with what just happened on my face like I'm here for it all day, so that's it
We just added some powder on top of it
I set basically my whole face with Patricks powder add a little blush a little powder bronzer
some mascara and a lip, I'm
Really impressed with how my foundation under-eye concealer like all that looks considering the fact that we mix so many different
In different kinds of formulas like the foundation alone we mixed in
Hydrating matte foundation full coverage long wear, gel, mousses like so many different types of formulas
And I think that they all play really well together same with the concealer it did kind of have a little bit of tingle
Happening in the beginning, but it kind of went away as soon as I put it on my face
Hopefully my face will not react crazy to it. *Please*
So that is it for me and the mixing of makeup
