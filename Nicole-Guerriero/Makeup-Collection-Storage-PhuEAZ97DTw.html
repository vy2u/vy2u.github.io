alone
so cheese
turning blue
she's on
right
I have an angel on my shoulder but a
devil in my but you can't LLL be right
back time to me I have an angel over
shoulder for the devil
so today is going to be a makeup
collection slash storage video and it's
going to be a talk through video usually
the collection or makeup tours that I've
done before
aka Beauty tours I've kind of just given
you like a brief overview of what I have
I've never really talked about it but
lots of you lots of you lots of you have
asked for this video over and over so
I'm gonna do a talk through of all my
makeup the storage containers that I
have where my vanity is from little
inserts in my drawer and all things like
that
collecting makeup before I started doing
YouTube but it has grown and I recently
just threw a ton of stuff away I went
through a couple weeks ago and got rid
of so much stuff so basically all the
makeup I have now just lives right over
there if you want to sit through this
long makeup collection storage video
then just keep watching the video so I
hope you guys enjoy and until next time
I will talk to you guys soon bye okay so
we're going to start on the left side
first so lots people always ask where
these acrylic cases are from and this is
actually two different pieces and this
set is from Muji so this is the two
drawer set and this is the five drawer
set the two drawer sets are wider than
the five drawers the five drawers are
actually really really skinny so this is
what this one looks like on its own not
attached to the other one and there's
two different kinds of two drawer ones I
got the one that had the top lift like
this because I did have different stuff
in it until just recently and then the
one underneath is just the five drawers
and you can see how slim those drawers
look and then this piece I get asked a
lot words from my lipstick holder and I
actually got this from love Melissa
Michelle in our swap video and I believe
it is she got this on Amazon I'm not
positive so we're gonna get a little
more in depth since lots of people want
to know we'll start on the lipstick up
here mostly I have in the front row
these are all Macs and then these are
two Lime Crime this is Viva Glam Nikki
and this is max pink Friday this was
limited edition I don't think that you
can get this anymore rebel other
favorite Diva Ruby whoo
just a really nice true read I'm not
gonna go through all of them just doing
this front row this is a cream Sheen
lickable and I got this in a Mac holiday
kit along with a lip glass and a lip
liner so I don't think that you can find
those and it's really like a sheer color
anyway and then these are the two lime
crime lipsticks I had in my haul video
ones red and one is black and then in
the back row I have mainly all
Maybelline lipsticks there's a YSL in
here that Lovelace Michelle got me and
it's number seven it's like a baby pink
color and then these are a few covergirl
but the rest of them are mainly
Maybelline lipsticks because I'm
obsessed with those there's a few red in
there too but it's mainly pinks and
purples and then in this top drawer I
mainly just keep the rest of my
drugstore lipsticks
except for this bottom row this bottom
row is like all Tarte lipsticks
and then these are all Revlon's in the
back we have a little bit of L'Oreal
some elf some NYX Yves pearl and that
looks like it sit back there and then
this is like a sleek like lip polish
they this next drawer I keep all my lip
liners in NYX lip liners in here there's
some Mac ones down here just some lip
glosses NARS a Mac creme Sheen there's
some NYX jumbo jumbo mega shine glosses
some Revlon just fit in some Sephora
glosses so just mainly lip liners and
glosses in this drawer so the cool thing
about the Muji drawers is that you can
pull them completely out onto the five
drawers this top one I mainly just keep
a brushes and oh excuse me could I just
mainly keep eye brushes in here that I
don't want to put over there with the
other ones these are the newer ones the
Sedona lace collection back here there's
some Sigma in here and then of course
the real technique brushes on the side
over playa then in this drawer I keep my
most used palettes and there's some
little primers over here the Urban Decay
primer potion and the lorac they're all
like nude palettes - this is the sleek
nude collection palette which just looks
like this
the lorac Pro palette the original Naked
palette which if you don't know the
story behind my Naked palette
my boyfriend's dog when we're at his
mom's house chewed my palette but it
didn't ruin really any of the shadows I
don't really I've never really used
these two darker ones so they got a
little messed up but I was like I waited
so long for this palette I did not want
to throw - what you can see that virgin
is completely bit the bullet how
attractive is that the Naked 2 palette
any neutral shadow that you could ever
want is basically right here in this
little drawer and then this drawer is
primers primer primer shine killer this
is a redness color corrector steel BB
cream priming moisturizing treatment
Yves pearl anti-shine treatment and then
the Make Up For Ever HD primer
this next one is kind of a little random
drawer NARS Laguna Neutrogena shine
control powder and then in here I have
my eyebrow stuff which is kind of over
here some jumbo pencils and then these
are all kind of eyeliners liquid liners
felt-tip liners a coal liner sugar lip
treatment my pencil sharpener and then a
spoolie eyebrow brush because my
eyebrows stuff is in here then this last
drawer is where we keep mascaras and
colored eyeliner so these are all my
mascaras needs gonna new one of this one
stat that's why I keep it open like this
so it dries even faster than it was and
it forces me to buy a new one these are
my five that I regularly use which is
L'Oreal voluminous Rimmel lash
accelerator power volume mega plush and
then colossal volume and I just have a
Dior show over here which I don't really
use too often and then just a purple
mascara which is great lash clear brow
gel a bunch of sparkly eyeliners and
just colorful eyeliners blue ones down
here gold these are just the Revlon
Colorstay whipped foundation I have 320
and 370 and then back there is just a
L'Oreal Lumi L'Oreal Lumi nw6 and then
this is a true match in suntan W 5.5 I
picked this up because I originally
thought it was going to be lighter than
W six because it was a lower number but
it actually turned out to be way darker
than W six so he kind of just hangs out
back there when I'm a little tanner I
mix him in what W six a lot of people
ask where I get this got this mirror
from and I think this mirror was
actually from Ross then I just keep my
setting sprays right here this is model
in a bottle and then this is skin Danai
via make a finishing spray then moving
on to brushes so this container I
actually got from the dollar store they
have lots of different shapes I also got
this skinnier one from the dollar store
as well and then insects likes and I got
it from Michaels I believe I just keep
my face brushes in here mainly bigger
sized brushes
um I have a bunch of run technique
brushes you guys just saw this is my
favorite contour brush it's from Sedona
lace a lot of people ask where this
large fan brush is from and it's
actually from Sedona lease as well I
haven't really um experimented with the
real technique brushes because I haven't
had that for that long then one that I
have used is this one which is the
contour brush go figure
so in this tin or in this glass jar I
just have shadow brushes that I kind of
use on the regular and aren't so much
newer ones like that where the other
drawer these are my concealer brushes
that I use on the regular they're just
the Sigma P 80 and P 82 brush which are
just like precision brushes this is like
my go-to fluffy brush it's from BH
Cosmetics I love this flat top one for
putting on glitter or anything like that
it's just perfect there's actually
glitter in it now I'm not sure the name
of it because this is an old set from
Sedona lace and they didn't put the
names on them before and then in the
front I just usually keep tweezers and a
nail clippers if I should need them I
forgot to mention them because they were
lying down but these are two of my most
used brushes this is the Real Techniques
stippling brush and then the real
technique powder brush can't live
without these they live here moving on
to this acrylic drawer this is a
completely different one than the Muji
one this is actually the original beauty
box and I wish I would have found this
before and put these rings on that are
up here and I wish I would have found
this before I actually found the Muji
Gorge just because this is one unit it's
one big piece the top doesn't open it's
just a little drawers but I wish I would
have found this one first because as you
can see the drawers are much larger I
mean there are OPI nail polishes down
there so we're going to move on to this
but I just wanted to let you guys know
that I do prefer this one over my Muji
drawers just because it is so much
bigger and you can fit lots more stuff
in these big drawers I do like the
Muji's I just like this one better so
and these drawers do come completely out
as well so if you want it to just take
them and set them down while you're
doing your makeup or if you have to go
to another room you could just easily
pick these up and carry so in here I had
my bomb this is a highlighter and
bronzor this is Mac msf I forget which
one it is this is perfect topping which
I don't even know if they make anymore
do on that powder mineralize skinfinish
in medium deep and then to phase
chocolate Soleil bronzer in milk
chocolate and then these drawers you can
see how deep they are you can fit more
stuff in them then you can move your
drawers I'll just show you a little
comparison you look so much bigger in
this drawer on this side I have just
some NYX roll-on glitters it's basically
kind of just a hodgepodge of stuff a
little Mac quad which is super similar
to this Maybelline eye studio quad these
are just cream shadows by NYX make them
forever hoola diamond powder which I
will be doing a tutorial with let you
guys asked for a look like from the
giveaway video this is just an elf
pigment eyeshadow and then these are two
sugarpill lose pigment eyeshadows which
are just gold and silver then in this
drawer obviously this is hoola bronzer
and coralista blush I have to turn this
down to show you guys everything else is
in here and then in the back here I have
just a bunch of sleek makeup this is the
suede effect powder and then the
luminous pressed powder and then I have
a bunch of blushes from sleek well I'll
show you this first this is a molten
metal metallic eyeshadow duo which just
looks like that cream shadows I have a
bunch of sleek blushes here I'll show
you guys I can get them opened
pomegranate which is like a nice pinky
color coral have pixie pink suede and
then this is a rubra I know right it's
orange I didn't know it was this color
when I got it and then under here this
is just a concealer and corrector
palette that I've never really used but
he's just hanging in there waiting for
his time to shine this is a sleek face
and contour kit which I love these and
this one is in the shade medium I
believe the affair medium and dark but I
could be wrong
and then this is the sleek contouring
and what is this contouring and blush
palette that is everything that is in
these drawers this is like a little
puzzle to put back together when I want
to get something out then this about I'm
a drawer mainly is concealers on this
side there's some dream Lumi some tart
some hard candy glamoflauge these are
some more sleek cosmetics concealers
it's called hide it so erase paste Eve
pearl products and then on this side is
mainly like eyelashes there's some more
concealer duotone lash glue more
concealer and the next curved liquid
liner which I still haven't tried I
found it the other day in my drawer when
I was cleaning everything out so I put
it in here so I could remind myself to
use it and then right here are just some
little Yves pearl palettes that I have
a bronzing and highlighting trio and in
the chroma lashes which just are amazing
in this bottom drawer I just have a
bunch of polishes that used to be like
sitting right here on my vanity because
I don't have any more room on my polish
racks so I'm so happy that these fit
because it just takes the clutter off my
vanity so I have 16 polishes in here a
nail buffer and a little coconut oil
right mango oil just kidding so I just
have a few OPI is in the front it'll
mask the Polish and then all the ones in
the back are just the L'Oreal polishes I
don't I don't think they have a name and
on this other side here I just have two
L'Oreal True Match --es this one is an
n8 cappuccino and this one is in w6 on
beige which is obviously my color not my
color but use this sometimes when I want
to do a little liquid contouring instead
of powder I have two powders in here of
my Ben Nye banana powder and then my Ben
Nye neutral set powder which is
basically just like a translucent white
powder this situation I also have some
backup setting sprays in here mini sized
and urban to clay and urban to clay in
urban decay D slick and makeup forever
our mist and fix laura geller
balance and bronzes in here and then in
the back there there's some color
tattoos a bold gold painted purple and
toughest taupe so and then back in the
back or just these kind of small little
Nix glitters there's four back there
just two silvers or gold and kind of
like an iridescent you want to see what
they look like watch my haul video so
that's everything that are in these
drawers but it all fits so again this is
the original beauty box and then these
are the Muji drawers vanity is actually
from Ikea and it's called the mom vanity
dressing the table
um some ideas don't have them and they
only come in white now in my akia it
didn't even have it on the floor I just
found it on the website and was able to
locate it in the warehouse so check your
IKEA you can check the website for the
mom adjusting vanity and the IKEA will
let you know if it's in stock at your
store or not ok so starting in the
drawers this is the only thing that's
bad about these IKEA mom mom dressing
table is that the drawer doesn't really
pull out that far so I kind of have a
lot of room back here but you're not
able to see it so I try to keep
everything forward so that I'm not miss
placing things so inside here I just
have these plastic inserts that I found
at Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond in the kitchen
section and they were relatively
inexpensive but these are just to one
size like this so this is kind of just a
drunk drawer there's like scissors in
here my eyelash curler backup bronzers
there's like jumbo pencils in here that
chroma lip gloss I just use the other
day Donna how I feel about it because it
smells some lip balms a nail file some
argan balm and a pencil sharpener onto
this next one I just keep kind of backup
lip glosses and stuff in here I just
have some sleek lip glosses some Eve
Pearl BH Cosmetics Revlon there's some
more chapstick and an eyeshadow base
hanging out in there and then these are
just little they're called paint pals
I'm sorry pout paints and they're kind
of similar to OCC's lip tars is what
I've been told so those are them this
insert is a little bigger but it again
is from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond and it's a 4
sectional little situation so in here I
just got some elf body glow there's some
blush in here some Mac cream blushes and
Nick H NYX HD photogenic foundation
which I've never tried some bronzers
some more concealers are hidden back
there and some more NYX foundations are
in here and then in this drawer I just
mainly keep like dual ended brushes that
I don't want to stick
they're in the sand and then on this
side I keep my pallets in here blush
palette this is a contour palette 20
eyeshadow palette neutral colors this is
a 28 neutral eyeshadow as well just to
have any names on it this is a 28 color
blush palette all the way at the bottom
the chroma mascara just hanging out
waiting to be used
there's the day and night palettes in
here the camouflage concealer palette
and a 6666 a lip gloss palette is under
there as well and in the back the others
more um it's my like first Mac palette
ever and it's like beat up as you can
see you can see that I was totally used
to be into really bright eyeshadows and
then I kind of just got over it and then
also this is just a cream palette this
is mainly for more like face painting
and stuff but this is by Ben Nye as well
but like I said it's mainly for like
face painting the jenny rivera palette
is back there and as well as the bh
cosmetics party-girl palette but they
way in the back so it's nice that the
drawers do fit this many palette we know
I need the room I like in a certain way
and then lastly in this corner over here
I just keep sponges my Beauty Blender
which clearly needs to be washed this is
the box that I use for my Ben Nye banana
powder there's a bunch of false lashes
back here some hair clips brushes that I
don't really use are kind of down here
in this drawer and some glue sticks and
a this is just a spatula and a little
like mixing board if you need it to mix
anything
oh but other than that that's complete I
do have like makeup and stuff stored in
these things but it's really makeup that
I don't ever use so we're not even gonna
go
the rules
so turn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
