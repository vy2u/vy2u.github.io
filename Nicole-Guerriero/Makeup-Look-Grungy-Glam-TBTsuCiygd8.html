realize how white my face looks until I
get on camera so we're going to start
this tutorial off the same way we set
off all of our tutorials we're going to
prep our face and I couldn't find my
brush so I had to use my finger which I
was not excited about because like I
tell you guys it gets stuck underneath
my nails and I'm just not a fan so I
start with the Bobbi Brown a vitamin
face face then we're going to do a
little makeup forever
skin equalizer in number two which is
the smoothing one I'm out of tissues and
then we're going to do a little bit of
the Make Up For Ever HD foundation in
the color 155 because it is matching my
self-tanner pretty good right now don't
drop it
they're just like too dotted all over my
face and then I'm going to blend it out
with this it cosmetics brush which I
still don't think I've looked up the
name yet but I will have it in the
bottom bar of this video I think I said
it in the last video and I didn't put it
in the bottom bar so apologies and I
just want to say in real life the color
difference from my neck to face when I'm
not wearing makeup doesn't look as
extreme so that's why I was a little
shocked and I got on here because
sometimes I get on here I'm like oh my
god it looks like I'm wearing a white
mask but in real life it doesn't look so
intense brows I would did those off can
because I know what I got time off of
that so we're gonna move on to the eyes
and I'm going to use the shade and light
palette from Kat Von D and the first
color we're going to work in our crease
is soleus which is described as an
expresso Brown so I'm just going to
apply a little bit of this color to the
outer corner and the crease of my eye
blending it as I go I'm working with
small amounts of color so that we don't
overdo it way too fast
following solos I'm going to add a
little bit of samal on top I'm going to
put all the names in the bottom bar
because I do feel like I'm butchering
them this color has a beautiful like
reddish undertone to it which I love I'm
packing this on the outer corner and in
the crease as well and then taking a
clean brush to just blend all the edges
out so we don't have any harsh lines
going into the tree which is it like a
chocolatey Brown I'm going to take a
pencil brush and just keep this on the
outer corner of my eye taking a clean
brush to just blend the color out so
it's not like so harsh just sitting
there in the corner of your eye but
using the pencil brush just helps me to
be a little more precise with everything
going back into some mall I'm going to
buff a little bit more of this on to the
outer corner of my eye and up into the
crease and kind of like right in the
inner corner crease like right
underneath my brow to just get a lot of
dimension in there
going in with starry-eyed from makeup
geek this is one of their foiled shadows
I'm just using it dry and I'm packing it
on with a Mac 242 just to the center of
the lid you can stay away from the inner
corner and the outer corner so much
because we're going to pack a little
more shadow onto those areas in a second
going back into Satori we're going to
pack this on the inner corners and the
outer corners of my of your lids my lids
your lids whoever's lids I was using
this fluffy brush at first but then I
wasn't like getting the color that I
wanted it was good for blending out the
edges and blending it into the foiled
shadow but I went back in to the same
color and used it on this little tiny
brush from BH Cosmetics just to really
pack the color on and then blend it out
a little more
time's the lashes I'm using these by
social eyes they are in vixen I love
these so similar to Mac 35s but you
don't need to curl them they're amazing
you
to conceal and highlight I'm going to
use a little combo of first the NARS
radiant creamy concealer I like this
because it's a little thicker but it's a
little light right now and then on top
of that I'm gonna put the Maybelline fit
me because it just blends out easier and
it would add a little bit darkness back
to the brightness under there and then
I'm going to blend it out with this duo
fiber brush from Real Techniques I love
it I found it at Ulta I believe
after I've lost my blending gun I like
to go back in with the it cosmetics
brush and just push everything in to
make sure that there's no excess product
left over from the duo fiber brush and
then before I set I like to just look up
one more time get any creasing out and
then go ahead and set today I'm going to
use the shade and light palette and I'm
going to use these two colors which we
listed down below because I can't
remember them right now and then I'm
going to set the rest of my face with
this powder foundation by Smashbox
for contouring I'm going to use these
two shades which are shadow plate in the
middle and subconscious on the outer
left or right I don't know what side it
was on you guys know my technique I like
to first carve everything out with this
morphe brush and then go in and thicken
it up and blend everything out with the
Real Techniques contour brush
taking infatuation by makeup geek I'm
gonna pop this on the apples of our
cheeks and then for highlight I'm going
to use the makeup forever compact shine
on in at number three and then you blend
until your arm falls off and I did add a
little bit of banana powder underneath
my contour because I felt like it looked
a little sloppy so it just cleans it up
for me
I'm just going to touch up the lids one
more time before we go into our lower
lids so I'm just going to do all the
same things I'm going to pack on the
chocolatey brown color to the outer
corners we're going to retouch up that a
highlight in the middle which is
starry-eyed from makeup geek just
anything that just needs to be
intensified before we move on
for my brow highlight I'm going to use
this concealer from Anastasia I don't
know I've just been into the concealer
for highlight I think it looks more
natural and it kind of just cleans up
your shadows if you go a little too high
like I tend to do oh haha
dipping back into solace we're going to
run this first underneath our well this
is the first color we're gonna run
underneath our lash line and I'm using
the shade and light brush the pencil
side which is amazing going under there
again with samal I'm just kind of
running all the colors that we used on
our upper lid on our lower lash line and
tell me this is not the truest mean
you've ever seen
taking show I'm running that underneath
as well and the brush that I'm using is
just a makeup geek fluffy brush to
really blur the lines and yeah I kept
getting shadow in my eye not fun I'm
taking just a little bit of starry-eyed
you just put right in the middle you
don't really see it until you look up
which just gave it like a greasy look
which I liked apply mascara to your
lower lashes in your top lashes and
we're moving on to lips in one second
after this clip right here nice I'm
going to use a stripped down from Mac to
just line my lips and fill them in as
well
and to finish it off I'm going to use
taupe by Mac to put right on top so it's
just a little smoother and not as drying
after that this look is complete I hope
you guys enjoyed I don't have anything
else to say except I love you guys
thanks so much for watching and until
next time I will talk to you guys soon
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
