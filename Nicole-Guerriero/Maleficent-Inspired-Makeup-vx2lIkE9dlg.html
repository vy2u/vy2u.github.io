hello and lovelies so today I am
transforming into Maleficent I am just
super excited to see this movie
Maleficent I know that there's times of
people putting Torah
tutorials up right now and totally
understandable because who doesn't want
to recreate how she looks like a fairy
gone bad and she looks so gorgeous and
scary at the same time I don't know I'm
loving it
so this look is based off of Maleficent
a to fab challenged me to recreate a
look using the MAC Cosmetics Maleficent
line so that's what I did today I didn't
base it completely off of her real look
I'm sorry this headpiece is so wonky I
did a basic offer complete look I kind
of was just going with the flow I wasn't
even looking at like inspiration
pictured when I was doing it this is
just kind of how I would wear my makeup
if I was a dark fairy don't mean I have
anything super important to tell you
guys so I'm going to go before my house
catches on fire so if you guys want to
see how to recreate this Maleficent
inspired look then just keep watching
the video thanks guys
hi hi so I already have my contacts in
and I have pressed on some stiletto
nails also I have already primed my face
and now I'm just going to apply my
foundation Maleficent has very pale skin
in the movie so I'm going to try to make
my face as pale as possible as you can
see I kind of have a spray tan wearing
off so I will be dragging this down my
neck so that everything blends
then for our evil brows I will be using
my uh Nastasia brow is in the color
brunette and I'm just going to outline
the bottoms and then I'm going to give
my arch kind of a pointed evil vibe not
gonna lie this is kind of how my brows
used to look
you
one evil brow down and on to the next
one
so once our brows are done ooh scary
we're moving shirt on to our eyes and
I'm going to be using the Mac Maleficent
palette and a first things first I'm
going to go in with the color concrete
and we're just going to work this right
into our crease
picking up the color ground Brown I'm
going to apply this to the outer corner
of my eye and up into my crease as well
mainly focusing the color on the outer
half and kind of ving the shape kind of
a wing shape and we're just using this
for a little more dimension a little
more depth in our eyes
then I'm just taking a clean fluffy
brush and blending everything out so
there's no harsh lines or anything like
that then I'm going to go ahead and pick
up the color gold mine and I'm just
going to place this on the inner half of
my eye it's a little bright for me at
first when I put it on like super gold
so I am going to go back over over it
with the color ground Brown and just
kind of doll it out a little bit
I'm also going to take that same color
gold mine and I'm going to use that to
highlight my brow bone
you're going to want to apply any kind
of liner I did that off-camera and now
I'm going to grab the color carbon and
I'm going to just use this against my
liner and keep it out on the corner but
work it up into the crease again just
giving more dimension and making our
eyes darker than they were here I'm just
taking the color ground brown no extra
product on it it's the same brush that
we use to apply it in the first place
and I'm just blending out carbon with it
to make sure that we don't have any
harsh lines and everything is nice and
blended
then I'm taking my makeup forever flash
palette and I'm just going to mark out
on my face where I want all my contours
to be I'm going to have a pretty strong
contour for this because Maleficent has
those beautiful prosthetic cheekbones
but I won't be using any prosthetics for
this so I just really need to define my
cheekbones so I'm going to cream Conkel
I'm going to cream contour first and
then I'm going to follow it with powder
before I go with my powders I'm going to
super highlight under my eyes because
this will just help bring out my
cheekbones the bright under-eye so
that's what we're going to do and I'm
just using the Maybelline age rewind
because I'm kind of obsessed with it at
the moment
I'm taking this sculpting powder from
Mac and I'm going to use the NARS brush
to just really really really define
those cheekbones I'm trying to keep my
line super sharp and super harsh so this
brush is perfect for that
I'm taking a really small angled brush
from Sigma and I'm just using that to
just carve out those cheekbones even
more and then I'm taking my foundation
brush and just kind of cleaning up any
edges to make sure that it's nice and
flawless and it's not like too far down
by my mouth mm-hmm so for lashes I'm
going to use my doll me up lashes so
there's one and we're gonna pop on the
other lashes chick and for underneath
our eyes I'm going to combine the color
ground brown and concrete and just
really smoke out that lower lash I'm
taking it down pretty far as you can see
but I wasn't going to add anything at
first and then I was like just do it and
I actually really loved it so yeah just
drag it down as far as you're
comfortable with and this look is almost
done oh we also don't want to forget to
hit our lower lashes with mascara
and then we're on to our lips which is
the last step so the first thing I'm
going to do is line them with kiss me
quick which is a pro longwear pencil
this is just going to help ensure that
your lipstick will last all night and
it'll help the red from bleeding outside
your lips so once your lips are
completely filled in I'm going to take
the Maleficent a true love's kiss
and apply it right on top so after that
our makeup look is complete the only
thing you have left to do is add your
headpiece and you are Maleficent so I
hope you guys enjoyed I love you until
next time I will talk to you guys soon
bye
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
