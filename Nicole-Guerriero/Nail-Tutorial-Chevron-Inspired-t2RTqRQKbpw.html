inspired manicure and the first thing
you want to do is start off with fresh
nails then we're going to take our base
color which is gonna be or Alize dazzle
and we're gonna do two coats of this
then we're gonna take such feet and
we're gonna do a top coat so that it
dries and we'll be able to do our
designs you want to make sure your nails
are completely dry so this is what you
should have then we're gonna move on to
our scotch tape yep scotch tape we're
gonna just take a regular piece and take
the pointed edge and place it right up
to the top of your finger to create two
kind of triangles on the side we're
gonna be painting this then taking our
first color which is just gonna be black
I'm using Sally Hansen's black heart
we're just going to paint any area
that's left out of the tape
then immediately after you want to
remove the tape while the Polish is
still wet I do this kind of slowly so
that I don't make any mistakes
and then this is what you should be left
with and now we're just gonna repeat
this whole process on all of our nails
and again we are going to top it off
with a such feat because we want all of
our coats to be dry before we move on so
then moving on to our second color I'm
using Sally Hansen again this is hard to
get I believe we are just going to cover
the black with two pieces of tape make
sure this is completely dry and then it
should look something like that then
we're just going to take a extra piece
of tape and then you could make this
second line as thick as you want I'm
just going to pop it right here and then
this is the X the other part that we'll
be painting white or whatever color you
want to paint it
so then again you just want to remove
the tape when everything is still wet
this makes it a lot easier to remove and
again I just take my time so I don't
make any mistakes
then you should be left with something
like this so then we're just want to
repeat this whole process throughout the
rest of our nails
so these are how your finish nails to
look member you could do any kind of
colors you want you could do more lines
here's a different example I did
turquoise and pink and I have three
lines you can do whatever you want
tape manicures are really fun and
they're pretty easy so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and until next time I
will talk to you guys soon right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
