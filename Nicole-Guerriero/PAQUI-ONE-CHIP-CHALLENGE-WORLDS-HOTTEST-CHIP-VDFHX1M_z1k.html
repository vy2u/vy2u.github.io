So you don't get it on your face, your eye
I'm not ready for this all right guys so we are going to do the one chip challenge today
You guys have not seen it, but this is it
This chip is made with the world's hottest
pepper
I've just started to like spicy things, so I'm super nervous. I know I'm gonna need some milk
And I drink rice milk
All right, you know, I'm
Gonna have to eat it and wash your hands though. I'm probably gonna die after I eat this chip
Yeah, are you going for it? So are we I'm just going in we can do

On the inside oh good, so it over video eat the chip
Don't say we didn't warn you attempt to conquer?
Oh Lord posted it says subjects can expect
short-term loss of speech followed by extreme profanity heavy breathing
enhanced sinus functions and impaired vision from heat induced tears
fear the reaper
Okay open up the sinuses
I'm so nervous
At least the air is pumping on me right now, so
Because I feel like I'm slab. I'm so nervous
Dula Mosby's
We've had these ships for a couple days FYI, and I've just kind of been
Chicken to do it scared Davis, but now at the time oh
No, it doesn't it's not do I have to eat the whole ship. That's a big chip to put in my mouth
It's a Dorito even Shaq didn't even eat the whole chip
Wash your hand
Okay look oh my god when you swallow it
Oh my god, it's hot oh my god. It's so hot I'm galloping
Sebast it's hella spicy

My lips are fire my lips
That's a
No all right
This is like water or boogers a little bit of both still hot
That was rough, it's still rough. It's still very painful
I would not recommend the one ship challenge stay away from the one chip
Not burden right now you mean yes burning

Hello
Every time you swallow, it's like you ate the chip all over again
My ears her I feel super nosh. She's super taster though. I am a super taster
Thank God
Look at his hair his hair's wet cuz he's just sweaty again
I do not recommend the one ship challenge under any circumstances unless you're trying to yourself up for about 20 minutes
I'm still dying on the inside though alright, so
That was fun. That was not fun. That was not fun. I'm proud of you though. I did. I really didn't eat the whole thing
That was my last spicy challenge of life expect to see no more
Spicy eating challenges done. I don't even think I like spicy food any more
Alright, so that is it for us. You gotta go change your shirt cuz I'm sweating like a man now because that ship and
I hated it
It was hot though definitely a 10 on the spicy scale that was like a
55
25 minutes of straight burn to the back of the throat to your eyelids like why a mile it's burning right yeah very good
But hey who's wrong, I did the one chip challenge. Shaq. I hate the whole chip you ate a bite
All right that is it for us guys. We hope you enjoy it and
I'll see you next video, okay
