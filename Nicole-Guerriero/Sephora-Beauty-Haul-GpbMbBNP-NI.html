I haven't seen you guys in like a week and two days
I think my last video was on Friday when we were talking about crystals
I just want to thank you guys for all the love on that video
And I know the main reason that you're here
Are to find out the winners of the crystal video so all the winners have been listed in the bottom bar
I have already reached out to them. They have 24 hours to respond back to me
Otherwise it is on to the next so hopefully all the winners that I chose will respond otherwise
Somebody else is gonna get an email
I will be doing more crystal giveaways in the
future and just lots of giveaways in general because if you guys could see the amount of
Makeup that is behind this monitor. You would be like
jaw drop so I'm gonna put together some mystery boxes and
Probably like 20 of them or so and then just start giving them out randomly throughout videos
So I'm gonna try to conquer that next week. I do have to go to LA again on Friday
Hopefully within like this week that I'm home
I can like really
Get in I'm probably gonna have like my mom and like my cousin come over and help me because it is so
Much makeup that I need to give to you guys anyways the crystal winners are listed down below
So I'm sorry that I haven't been a little m.i.a for the past week
I just it doesn't matter like how many times. I travel how long I've been doing it
I think I got my shit together, and then I come home, and I'm just dead I'm the zombie
I want to lay in the bed. I don't want to move I want to cuddle with my cats and eat bagels
I mean we have been a little busy me and Jeremy have like a little side hustle going on that you guys will see soon
so we've been kind of taking care of all that and
I'm excited for you guys to see so like I said I gotta go back to LA on Friday
Because I will be at generation Beauty this weekend, which I'll be there Sunday
And I'm gonna be at the eyewear booth so if you guys are at gem UT on Sunday. Please come see me
I'm not exactly sure yet what time I meet up is, but I'll probably have it listed in the bottom bar for you guys
so that you
shall know so if you're gonna be a genuine love to hug you and squeeze you and take a picture with you and
I'm gonna be at my eyewear booth, so you know my lashes will be there
Jim bead is like one of my favorite beauty conventions to go to just because I feel like it's like super duper organized
Anyways today's video is going to be a Sephora haul because I feel like I haven't done a haul in a really really
Really long time and it's almost a little sick to me though
But I still buy makeup even with all that makeup this sitting over there want to give all that makeup to you guys
That's why I kind of just been like hoarding it over there in that corner
but I still do my makeup I
Just love makeup I've always loved makeup I've always loved buying it. I don't remember the last time
I was actually like in a Sephora like buying stuff
Which kind of makes me a little sad because that used to be like my one of my favorite things to do was I go
And Sephora and touch and feel everything, but now I'm just like such a online shopper cuz it's just don't easiest
So yeah, I just want to run through the products that I got from Sephora
I don't know if some of them are new there's one product in here that I really want to talk about cuz I got to
Try it before I got it from Sephora, but we'll talk about that in a second
so
Shall we start yeah, let's start so first things first
We're probably I think this is probably the most expensive item that is in my Sephora haul
This is the Natasha's Nonna tropic palette. I have all the Natasha Jinan apalis, and I do purchase them all myself
I'm not on the PR list for her, and I'm not trying to get on the PR list either
I just like to buy things if I know I'm gonna talk about it on my channel because I feel like it gives like a
more authentic
Kind of review of the product if you're spending like your hard-earned money on it
and I mainly buy them because I want to have all of these in my collection I
Think my favorite one from her is like one of her original ones
It's like I don't even remember what the name of it is, but this is the tropic palette
This is a newest palette that came out, and I wanted to get it because it was different than what I had
Like palette wise I'm sure that I could find these colors like individually but sometimes
I like to just have it things in a palette so if I'm traveling I can take them with me
So this is what this guy looks like it's really beautiful very tropic. I love this shade
I love all these shades here even these shades like this green
I think is really pretty
I've been drawn more to green eyeshadows lately which kind of is making me like what I feel like any time I see a green
I'm like yes. I want to do a look with that. I know we did one
Probably like two months or so ago with the cheers to beauty from coloured raine
but I definitely want to do a look with this screen and this mint Frost and
This just kind of quad right here and this situation so it's very very beautiful
Definitely on the pricey side this is more like if you want to splurge on something
Give it to somebody as a gift if you just want a hashtag tweet ciao sell
I don't want to swatch any of them here on camera with you guys because when we use it in a video
That's when I want to swatch it so even when
The sky in the next makeup look because I feel like there having done a makeup tutorial in a minute
Right heavily, I don't even know I don't even know what's going on with my life
There's so much happening next I got these little peace out acne 20 acne
healing dots with salicylic acid vitamin A and aloe vera
So I got these mainly for
Flying because most of the time when I fly I do end up breaking out because it's just so dry in the cabin
And it's all that recycled air and most the time
I'm flying to LA and that's like a five-hour flight so yours on there for so long
Um so I wanted to be able to have something that I could just like put on my face if I felt like a breakout
Happening like you see this guy right here
You see this guy yeah, that's from the last plane ride, but other than that
I feel like my skin has been doing pretty well, so I mainly got these guys just for traveling purposes
And it's basically just like a little sticker that you stick on your face. I don't know if these are clear
Actually, let's pop this open so we can see so they come in a little pack like this and you have two little individual packs
And then there's ten little dots on each one so you would pull this open
So there are these little dots that look like this
And then you would just place them over your blemish and let it sit there
And you would let it sit there for six hours
Or you can leave it on overnight the ones I had before I'm pretty sure were from Pierre Thomas Roth
And those worked really good as well, and then I saw these on Sephora
So I just wanted to give them a try cuz they had pretty good reviews so again. These are the keys out acne
healing dots
Clearly I felt like I was gonna be breaking out
So I got some things for breaking out because this is from bosha, and this is the charcoal spot corrector
I used to be obsessed with the Mario Badescu
You know little pink stuff that you would put on your face every coat is called drying lotion drying lotion got it
And then I used this other one and I haven't used any of these like little spot treatments in a really long time
But I saw this one and was intrigued by it, and I was like you know what flow is right around the corner
So we know what happens when she comes to town
And I've never used a charcoal one before so that's what this guy is just a little charcoal version of like the acne spot treatment
So you're supposed to take a cop?
So he just wants to take a q-tip pop it in here
And then pop it on to your blemishes and let that chill overnight
So this says to leave on for a 1-hour for a quick spot treatment or overnight for maximum treatment
Benefits most the time I do use this stuff overnight
Once it all settles
It'll just be the charcoal here, and then it's clear like on top
It's a little shaken up because you know it was like in the box and stuff
But basically the same idea as any kind of drying lotion this one is just with charcoal which is supposed to really help like
draw out impurities in the skin
So I'm surprised that this is kind of the first charcoal spot
Treatment situation that I'm seeing, but I'm excited to use it it will be hitting this little man tonight
I feel like I've got a lot of skincare
I didn't really get any makeup the only makeup that I got was like that palette. I think anything else
Everything else is like skinny carry. That's fine. That's fine right so the next product
I want to talk about is summer fridays
And this is the product that I got to try before I actually got it for my Sephora haul because my homie
Marianna Hewitt and her homie Lauren actually created this product
And this is their first product from their brand their brand is summer fridays
And the mask is called the jetlag mask and this is a hydrating mask now
I bought it when it came out on Sephora cause like I said, I like to bad-mouth shit
But Mariano was sweeten up
and she actually sent me the mask so I got it before my Sephora order came in I think I got it the day I
Got home from LA which was on Tuesday, and I put it on my face and oh my god
I don't think I've ever been as
Impressed with a skincare product as I was with this
Because you put this on your face for ten minutes you let it absorb into your skin
You can use it as like only under eyes. You can put it all over your face
You can use it as an overnight mask you can use it as a quick mask you can use it as your base
Before you put on your foundation and when I tell you I woke up the next day with the plumpest most
hydrated
Flawless looking skin. I honestly I wrote her
I was like I was blown away when I woke up and saw my skin this morning when you put it on your face like
it instantly just feels like your face is like plumping and just like soaking all the hydration in it makes me look so
Dewy like I said, I've never been this blown away by a product by only using it one time
I think it has a little bit of like a peppermint tea scent to it
Which you don't like think of when you think of a face next
But it kind of just feels like invigorating like on the skin, so totally blown away by this mask
I absolutely love it if you have a chance to try this mask if you have dry skin if you have oily
Skin if you have whatever kind of skin you have all skin needs hydration
Best hydration mask I have ever ever tried
And I probably won't ever use another hydration mask unless they come out with one cuz I'm gonna try it, but other than that
Number one it's like sometimes
I can't tell if I'm just like too much highlighter on or if I'm like actually greasy
Anybody else next I picked up some of these
Luminous dewy skin masks from tatcha because I see everybody in their mom on Instagram getting facials from Yoli
Desi Katy James Charles just everybody just having this luxurious facial in their house
I'm just like I want you only to come to my house
But I live in Florida so I understand I understand but usually she uses these masks on them
So I wanted to give them a try myself again
these are the aluminous Dhulia mask it is a sheet mask so it's the one that like make you look like Jason from Friday the
13th that you're gonna kill somebody
But you're not you're just hydrating your skin. These are also great to use when you're traveling
They're also great if you're just lounging around your house and bagels like me alright next I got from Sun in Park
This is the beauty filter cream, and it says below on the bottom
I'm just as intrigued as you are okay. We have a little applicator
It says that this is effortlessly absorbed into the skin and it provides coverage
So I want to take a little bit off the top and just rub it into my hand and see like
It's really nice
So you can see like the nice sheen I don't know if there's like any coverage
It says it provides coverage, but I didn't think that it will provide coverage
It just looks like it would give you like this beautiful luminescent dewy glow underneath your makeup
And it doesn't have like any kind of sticky feeling or anything like that so all
Of this like anything that we can use in the next makeup
Tutorial like makeup prep wise we will be using it did absorb SuperDuper quick into the skin
So I'm excited to try this for our next makeup look again
This is from Sun and Park
And it is the beauty filter cream hello diamond buff from a bee sting and it looks the way
Let me get let me get it. Let me do it. It's basically like getting a microdermabrasion
But at your house, so I'm excited for that because I like getting facials
I just don't get facials as much as I should and you're gonna use this to buff your skin
It's going to remove a layer of dead skin which is going to provide a more vibrant looking skin
it's going to help with like old acne scarring by removing the dead layer it encourages new cell growth it improves the absorption of
hydrating lotions and serums increases elasticity and stimulates collagen production
I also like this because it is convenient I can travel with this. There's no cords
I can just throw this in my makeup bag and go but again. This is the diamond buff I
Like don't even want to touch it because I don't want to contaminate it with my fingers
This is from Vito Liberata, and this is the body blur I've been using this for a really long time
and I just had to read up on it I
Think is this the one that I got
Yeah, basically like body makeup so if you want to slather this all over your chest your arms your legs wherever you want
It's going to give you like this
Beautiful like it very much reminds me of like Sally Hansen airbrush legs how you just look like you're just so smooth and flawless
This is what this does for you as well. I like to use this when I'm filming sometimes
Just to kind of put like all over this area because it looks really good on camera
It just makes you look smooth and flawless. I don't have it on today
But I picked it up in a shade darker because the color that I was using was just getting a little too light for me
So this is in the shade mocha, which I feel like it might be a little too dark
But may become like mix it with my other shade latte and just kind of create the perfect mesh like I said it just really
Smooths you out. It covers everything and just makes you look absolutely flawless so if you have never tried body blur
Try a girl summer is right around the corner
Look look I did get something else makeup related, so this is from buxom and this is their above a plum
But this is a shiny liquid lipstick you guys know
I'm all about the shiny lip life, and this is in the shade taupe it off
I probably have all these over there hanging out in the corner
But I just was not trying to go through and like I said most of that stuff. That's over there
I want to give to you guys
But this is what it I?
want to I
Can't really tell the reason I bought this yeah
Is I thought that it looked very similar to the lip color that I have on right now?
And I create this color every single day
it's with a lip liner three lipsticks and
A gloss to get this color and look at this it is like basically the color on my lips which is what I'm excited about
This is from buxom and it is in the shade taupe it off. It's definitely not topi
It's a very like it's basically the color that I'm wearing on my lips without all the work
It's just one thing and then last but not least from milk. We have the gold foil face gloss
I'm really not even sure what this is let's pop this open actually
Let's see a clear high shine gloss with floating gold glitter flex for a dewy
editorial glow swipe on your cheekbones use as a high shine highlighter layer over eyes shadow for a glittery
Glossy lid or on the lips as a glitter gloss have you guys been watching glam masters
cuz I have
And I want to do like
Like all the challenges that they do I would never go like so many people have written me and been like oh my god you
Need to be on the next season glare masters first of all I could never because that just seems so scary to me
And yeah, I'm an artist and I'm sensitive about my shit, and I couldn't I could not handle being critiqued up there, so yeah
I feel like
Mmm
Because sometimes when they say you could use this like on your lids or on your face like sometimes
It's just like too sticky or too heavy of a feeling, but that's like actually really nice
And you can see all the glitter flecks happening
Milk makeup made me think of one of the judges cuz she's like one of the co-founders. It's the blonde lady
I can't remember her name. I'm sorry
But I was saying I want to do like I want to recreate like all those challenges
I've been writing them down in my phone so we might have like a glam master series. It's not sponsored
I'm not trying to be sponsored
I just think that the challenges are cool and that you know we should try to create them to it
There's like a black and white challenge and a rainbow challenge and a fluoro challenge, and I'm like I want to do this
But not on TV. That's actually really nice. I feel like this is gonna
Be like fire like for like music festivals like this like slathered all over yourself. Oh girl
So that was all of our Sephora haul. I hope you guys enjoyed I know it's been a minute
But I try not to buy makeup. You know I try but sometimes. It just calls to me. Just take a look at the app
See what's new at Sephora stay tuned for more giveaways because you guys seem to really enjoy them, and I just have so much
So much makeup to give to you guys so be on the lookout for that and again
I will be at generation Beauty on a Sunday March 25th, so if you're there
Please come see me because I would love to squeeze you so that is it for me
You know that I love you, and I will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
