hair tutorial for those girls with not
hair down to their hips like me
just kidding our hair extensions you
know that so today we're just going it
to do a really fun kind of wavy big sexy
hair kind of spiel we're just gonna jump
right in so that I don't continue
rambling because even though you guys
have only seen probably 30 seconds of me
rambling I've probably been sitting here
rambling for about 45 so let's jump into
the hair tutorial the first thing I'm
going to I'm going to spray it with just
a little bit of heat protectant this is
one of my favorites it's from kqc and it
just think thermal shine spray we're
just going to use my Nunis three-in-one
this is the 25 millimeter wand this is
the most versatile tool so if you didn't
want to go for something like the whole
three-in-one spill you could just get a
regular wand and the 25 millimeter is
definitely the one that I use all the
time so this is just the easy part we're
just going it to take sections of hair
about that big and then we're just going
it to wrap them around our barrel easy
peasy lemon squeezy I'm sorry I've been
watching people's vines all day and I
just like being weird
there was nothing fall and then you're
gonna have just a little curl like that
so then we'll just do the same thing
you've seen it me do this a million
times and I'm probably sure if you watch
youtube videos you've seen other people
do this a million times so we're just
going it to do this and like I said the
end is where we're gonna put actual
product in our hair I feel like we don't
ever put product in our hair but we're
going to today and these don't have to
be perfect because this is just gonna be
like a little messy do because I don't
like perfectly perfect hair orange what
are you looking at we're just going to
throw me into fast-forward so we can get
this done as soon as I get
so this is what you would be left with
when you were all done curling your hair
as you can see it kind of just sits
right here so what we're gonna do is
we're just going to flip it over and run
our fingers through it I'm actually
going to take off all my rings because
we're gonna use some product I'm just
gonna flip it around and shake it up
the product that we're going into mainly
uses they flip it over I've had this
forever and it only really works when I
wear my hair shorter so I little bit
I've been able to have it for a really
long time so all you do is you just
shake it up really good and then you're
gonna flip and you're gonna spray a
little in your hair and then you're
gonna give it like a scrunching motion I
never I don't even think I told you what
this was it's just a texturizing and
finishing spray so it's gonna give your
hair lots of texture you can flip it
back and try to find your part
to make sure all my texture stays in my
hair I'm going to finish it off with
some big sexy hair spray and play and
this is just a volumizing hairspray so I
just like to lift and kind of spray in
here
and that is it so I'm loving this
hairstyle it's super super easy to do
the main part is just getting that hair
curled but this hair the next day is
bomb I like it even better than when I
actually do it right now I mean I do
love it in the shorter hair but the next
day I'm even a bigger fan of it remember
the really only things you need is a
wand and some texturising spray
hairspray just added if you want to lock
in your texture like I do but just find
some kind of texturising spray I've used
a bunch and this is definitely my
favorite so but again you don't have to
use this one you can use and find if you
find a different kind you can go with
that one I hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you try out this hairstyle send
them to me on my Twitter or tag me on
Instagram because I love to see your
guy's recreations so I don't think I
have anything left to say except I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and until
next time I will talk to you guys soon
shorts Ashley Oh Shashi let's try that
again well you know you're not supposed
to be in this chair
haha boy
toss them to the back I have all these
aerosol cans around me
I'm afraid I'm gonna combust not seem in
focus or maybe I can focus my focus
