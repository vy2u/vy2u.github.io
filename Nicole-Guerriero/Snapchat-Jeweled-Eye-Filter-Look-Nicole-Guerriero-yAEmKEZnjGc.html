a tube top because it's a scorching
outside um but before I jump in I know I
look extra crazy it's just cuz I have a
spray tan the other day and it's a
little intense
the first day for me especially when I
don't have makeup on and also I have way
blonder hair so I got my hair done
yesterday again because I was just like
super gold and I wanted to do it and I
wanted it to be like more blonde so
didn't have a little session yesterday
so this is what we ended up with and I
am loving it I'm gonna leave it like
this for a minute I think next time I go
back I'm just gonna pull my roots down
lower but I wanted to edit my blog today
if you follow me on snapchat you saw me
trying to recover my vlog footage all my
clips are missing so I figured why that
was trying to sort itself out I would
film some kind of a makeup look but I
didn't want to do like a regular makeup
blur I wanted to do that like sparkly
looking I look from snapchat like a
snapchat filter video kind of look and I
didn't think that I had like jewels for
it but I found this little pack of
jewels right here and these are from
Michaels and it's just um I ripped the
thing off so it's hard to see what they
are I think it just says assorted Faced
acrylic set I have no idea but there's a
bunch of little baby jewels in here and
I wanted to do the Spanish at filter
tutorial because I just felt like being
a little bit more creative today haha
that's what we're gonna do today so
hopefully guys you stick around and you
want to watch it with me so I'll have a
video today so this video is going up
today and then I'll have my vlog
tomorrow hopefully if I get all my
footage back well I'll take forever to
edit because it's like me editing down
seven hours of footage into like 30
minutes for you guys to watch and then
I'll have another video on Friday I
would have one on Thursday but I'm going
to film a segment for the local news
station here I think it's channel 8 that
I'm filming for on Thursday it's not
live so we're just shooting it on
Thursday and then it'll air next
Thursday so then I'll have another video
for you guys on Fridays yeah let's jump
in so I'm gonna do the same thing that I
usually do before I do any of my makeup
and you're just gonna prep my face so
we're just gonna add some moisturizer my
face has been breaking out like crazy
because I traveled so
in the past two weeks and just being on
an airplane is not you know like the
greatest for your skin so excuse that
breakouts and then of course we're just
gonna add a little bit of primer so now
we're just gonna even out our skin tone
and I'm super tan so I don't know what I
think I'm gonna use this one 53 from
makeup forever just gonna pump this on
to the back of my hand and then use a
damp Beauty Blender to and then did out
twist I don't know I didn't want to do
my regular makeup today I've been like
staring at that snapchat filter I'm like
I just want to look like this I was like
why don't you just want a video on it
yes I talked to myself and then taking a
damp Beauty Blender does cat hair on it
it bounced this into the skin Oh
thinking about is my blog footage I've
been using the color taupe now from
anastacio I've been using like these two
colors to fill in my brows I got them
lightened a little bit when I got my
hair done the first time so like a month
ago maybe I don't even know how long
I've had like hair I've had it done so
many times that's the way on my lap but
I'm like tucked underneath the desk
really really well I guess I'm done
doing my brows since you stole my
freaking brush I'm so now I'm just gonna
do a little bit of concealing and
highlighting you know to add to mention
to the face before we add all of our
jewels and everything that'll be like
the last thing at that we do so for my
concealer I'm just going to use my
Maybelline fit me concealer it's like
one of my favorite it's gonna look a
little dramatic because tan my gosh I'm
trying but it's okay um most makeup you
can make work for you you can just blend
it out share it out if you feel like
it's like too crazy I'm gonna even like
highlight places on my face that I
wouldn't normally highlight because
I don't got time for that I was like
this that's intense sir
I'm just using this brush from Sigma
it's like a soft blend concealer brush
and I'm just using patting motions as
always just to Pat the concealer in so
by pushing product into your skin you're
just gonna get better coverage and
you're also going to keep the makeup
underneath in place so you're not going
to disturb you know like your foundation
or anything like that I'm just gonna
take it up onto the eyelid as well try
doing your makeup with a cat in your lap
and holding onto him so he doesn't fall
off the chair all right so then I'm
gonna take just my Beauty Blender and
just pounce that out even more tuck it
up Bobbi's tuck it up if you're gonna
try to stay up here so you guys could
see this how do you expect me to film
Zee like I'm holding him up holding his
butt trying to film just like with one
hand cuz he doesn't want to sit in his
chair he wants to sit here he tries to
grab everything so I'm just setting up
my makeup with a little bit of the laura
mercier secret brightening powder
putting it on the lids of my eye as well
all I want to do is put the jewels on my
face we can desktop the excess so I'm
using this NARS Laguna bronzer I think I
don't know if this was like a limited
edition I got this from Namie's last
time I was in LA and it's just like a
huge freaking pan of Laguna bronzer and
it smells so good it smells like there's
gardenias mixed into it or something I
don't know it just it smells so good and
I'm also using this NARS brush I forget
what this kind of brush is called like a
uh when you know the name but you just
don't know the name to tell you guys I
haven't listened in the bottom bar for
you guys though and then I'm just gonna
use this two wrong
the face smells Vil good and being you
trying to make his way back over here I
just realized that they took that
snapchat filter off like just now I just
want to go look at it and it is gone but
that's okay I have a picture of me saved
with it in my phone
does she have lashes on of course she
has lashes on though your own personal
lashes that you're gonna put on yourself
feel free to blow on them to speed up
the drying process cuz you know you want
to wait about 10 15 30 seconds before
you put your lash on so it's nice and
tacky so it's not going to slide all
over the place when you put it on to
your lid but you know if you're a
professional makeup artist don't blow on
your lash because if I was getting my
makeup done
I wouldn't want somebody being like and
then put that eyelash like me I'm like
no girl I'm gonna need a fresh pair but
if they're your lashes feel free to blow
on them okay so I think I'm ready to add
my jewels
again I just picked these up at
Michael's I've had these since last
Halloween I basically just have like
three Halloween kind of containers that
I keep like on my like special effects
diamonds glitters paints facial like
everything I keep all in this little box
so I have these guys in here and they're
just a bunch of different size little
jewels that I can put onto my face so
let's go ahead and jewel these guys on
so how I'm going to adhere them is I'm
just going to use lash glue I'm going to
squeeze some out on to just this is like
an eyelash and has eyelashes on it just
so it gets a little bit tacky and so
it'll be easier you know so they won't
like slide all over the place kind of
like the same deal how you put your
lashes on and I wish I had a little I'm
sure I have one somewhere but I can't
find it you know to pick jewels up and
put them on so I'm just gonna use some
tweezers so let's start with our bigger
jewels first on our base so I'm just
gonna take a jewel like this dip it into
our lash glue you don't want a bunch on
there because you don't want it like I
said to slide all over the place and
then place our jewel where we want it so
this guy is gonna go here
okay I could probably stick jewels on my
eye all day long but I think I'm gonna
leave this one as is and then go ahead
and start working on our other eye
it was like socially acceptable you know
just like walk around your makeup like
this I think I'm gonna keep it okay am I
gonna target like this don't say my name
all right so I'm just gonna leave it as
is and I'm gonna add a little bit of
blush and I'm gonna use a bright pink
blush because I think the filter
had like a really right cheek it was
like little circles little circles on
your face and then it had a really
bright pink lip and I had a lip here so
I'm gonna use this one from Anastacio
and this is party pink I'm gonna line my
lips first cuz you know me so here's the
finished look and this is how the
snapchat filter look it had like a
really pink lip like this but I'm not
loving this lip with it like I'm really
gonna wear this look but I really you
have to change it and then I was gonna
do a clear gloss this one is from Grell
lactic and it is sheer bone so this is
the finished look I like it much better
with a nude lip like I'm actually gonna
wear this out and about which I might
because I actually really like how it
turned out I'm gonna go to Target like
this I might do just no go to my mom's
house or something I gotta get let
somebody see it I was gonna say I'm not
sure where you would wear it to and it
sucks because Coachella just finished
but I think this would be a really cool
music festival look I'm not sure how
many more music festivals are coming up
but I mean there's got to be more than
just Coachella so this would be a really
cool music festival look I love it cuz
you're pretty much just simple and then
you just have like these really cool
jeweled eyes so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video hopefully when I go back
downstairs my vlog footage will be there
and I'll be back with regular makeup
tutorials soon but I just felt like no
gluing a bunch of jewels to my eyes
today and felt like sharing with you
guys so again I hope you guys enjoyed I
don't think I have anything else to tell
you guys except I love you thank you so
much for watching and until next time I
will talk to you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
