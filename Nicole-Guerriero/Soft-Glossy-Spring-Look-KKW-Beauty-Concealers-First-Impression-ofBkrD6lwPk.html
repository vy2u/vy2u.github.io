Today we're going to do, I don't know, some kind of flawless, springy looking face.
I have some new products that I want to use, some drugstore, some high-end.
I did order the KKW Beauty concealers
because I got booted off the PR list because I was talking [beeped] about the contour sticks because I don't care about them and I
Still don't care about them. I thought you guys would just like to see an unbiased opinion on them
I
Ordered the concealers because I, you know, I'm a concealer fan concealers are like one of my favorite things
So I had to try them out. The thing that I'm most excited to try is the brightening powder
Um so I only got a few shades because by the time I remembered that they were
Launching a lot of them were already sold out, so we're gonna try those today and some drugstore foundations
Just it's gonna be like a combo of high-end and a drugstore on the face today
But before we jump in I quickly want to mention my audible pick for the month
I just finished last month's book which was &quot;How To Win Friends and Influence People&quot; and this month
I am on to &quot;Self Talk&quot; it is by Aston
Sanderson and before we jump in if you want to start a 30-day free trial with audible all you have to do is go to
Audible.com/nicole and you're in there. They have an unmatched selection of books
I say it all the time anything you want it is there. You guys know that I listen to self-empowerment books because
[clears throat]
This month especially has been really stressful like super draining,
Um, I don't want to, I never want to get on here and like whine and complain, even though I might be whining and complaining right now, uh.
That's the main thing I like about audible is I can just pop in my headphones
and it really helps to kind of
Redirect my thoughts and just really focus on positivity because as much as I try to be a positive person
It's really really easy to be a negative person so if you want to be positive you have to work on it
So that's why I just
Continuously listen to these kind of self empowerment books 'cause it just, like I said, it helps to redirect your thoughts.
What I like about it is the chapters are really short. I'm on chapter 9. There are 17 chapters, but each one of these chapters
I think is only about 9, 10 minutes long, and it's basically all the stuff that I say to you guys all the time
It's about positive thinking and self-love and just redirecting your energy to focus on positive things in your life
As simple as I'm so thankful for the roof over my head like just easy things that you can be thankful for that
Really make a huge impact on your life.
So if you guys want to check out audible all you have to do is go to audible.com/nicole start downloading audiobooks
Try the ones I've listened to, try ones you want to listen to, I don't just listen to self-help like I love listening to like
Harry Potter on here 'cause it like especially, like, when I'm filming, like ah, you know what I should put it on right now.
But Tiny's here. I don't know if she wants to listen to Harry Potter, so we're just gonna watch Vanderpump as we film
Yeah, if you guys want to check out audible
I have all the books that I listed in the bottom bar as well as the link or you can text
I'm pretty sure you can text now to start a 30-day free trial so all the information will be listed in the bottom bar and
Let's get into the makeup tutorial.
So to start this look we are going to moisturize no surprise here I'm using my touch of water cream to hydrate the skin and then this happened
Are you [horn honking]
Kidding me, but the power came on about an hour later, and we finished moisturizing so once the face is nice and hydrated
We're gonna move straight on to primer and for this we are using the Tatcha Silk Canvas
It's like this balmy primer that I've used a couple times
And it comes with this disc and you're supposed to scrape some up. I always think I use too much
You're only supposed to use like a rice size
Amount and I try my hardest to take the smallest amount, but somehow I always feel like I have way too much.
It does take a little extra time for me to work it into the skin, but that's not an issue
I do really like this primer like I said, I've only used it a couple times, but do really like it.
I think it's cool that you can use this primer for not only your face
But you can use it for your eyes and your lips as well
For foundation we are using the l'Oreal True Match my OG
I haven't used this foundation in so long and I don't even know why I haven't.
It's so good. If you've been watching my youtube videos for a long time. You are used to this foundation.
This is the old-school way I used to put it on. Just dot it all over my face and then blend it out
So that's what I'm going with. I'm using it in my old color
W6 which is Sun beige
And then we're gonna blend this all out with a damp
Beauty Blender. This foundation is so good if you've never tried this foundation stop this video, go to the drugstore, get it.
It's just as good to me as Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk
It just gives you this natural dewy, healthy-looking face, but providing a lot of coverage
So I honestly don't know why I stopped using this foundation
I guess I was just trying to be like greedy and use all the foundations in the entire world!
But you always go back to your number one
Moving on to the brows you know they take me forever, so we are just going to use the power of editing
to get them on.
For our eyes I'm first going to dampen a brush and then take the shade 11:11 from this Colourpop palette
Which is called &quot;All I See is Magic&quot; and this is the only shade that we're gonna use today
We're going to keep it simple, glowy and springy so by dampening our brush
We're just gonna get like a more metallic vibe from our shadow
You could totally use it dry
But I just wanted to use it wet 'cause we're also gonna add just a little something on top. I feel like I've been doing
Like tons of cut crease looks so I just wanted to keep this guy really simple for spring and I'm gonna buff out the edges
Because since this is a shimmery shadow sometimes it can look a little harsh so
I'm just using a clean brush for that. Moving on we are going to take this You Glow Girl, which is like this iridescenty,
jelly,
Gloss and I'm gonna pack that on my lids right on top of the shadow like I said, it's just this iridescenty vibe
I love it 'cause it's glossy and it takes any eye look from bland to BAM! For mascara
I'm using the Blend &amp;amp; Care from Eylure which is really just like a false lash
Blender to kind of help your falsies and naturals
But I haven't been wearing false lashes lately because I got a lash lift not that long ago
And I just don't feel like it's necessary, but I still really really really, really love this mascara
So just goes to show you can use it on your natural lashes too and just not for your falsies
On to the concealers, I'm gonna use a combo of two and six to is on the bottom. Six is on top
I am starting first with
Six when I first put this on I wasn't loving the wand, like I really wanted to hate it
You know like I was going in thinking, hm, Kim K
Mmhaha!
But the only downside that I could find so far was just like the wand was just a little floppy which not life or death.
Second, I started blending it out with a
brush that I usually blend out my concealer 'cause I was thinking like okay if you just wanted to buy the concealer and not the
Brushes that came with it would it works
So I used this brush all the time to blend out my Shape Tape for this concealer
It didn't like it
Okay
This concealer to me is a lot more dry than the Shape Tape that I'm used to using not saying that's a bad thing
I'm just saying for this brush and concealer combo
No like I was dying, so I decided to switch to a Beauty Blender
I dampen it up a little bit and it took a little bit of the product off
Initially which I thought was fine, 'cause I know I'm gonna go over it with two
Um, but it did blend out a lot better with the Beauty Blender so on the other side
I'm just going to straight blend it out with the Beauty Blender, and I had no issues with it
I also think that the coverage looked a lot better with me
Just blending it out with the Beauty Blender, than blending it out with the brush
I am going to try the concealer again using the brush that she has, like that little duo ended,
But if you want it to buy it without you know her tools I feel the best way to go
Blending wise is with the Beauty Blender. So I wanted super duper highlighted under eyes
So I'm going in and just adding a few strokes of Two and I was gonna try her brush
But that little spongy thing just did not feel good
I wasn't trying to mess it up so I was like let me just go
With the Beauty Blender 'cause it didn't let me down a second ago, so adding Two to it. I feel like
Really made my undereyes super duper bright the concealer is pretty good. It is really full coverage
I do like the consistency of it. It is on the drier side like I said
But I don't think that's an issue it didn't crease on me, and if I didn't start with that brush
I feel like I would have said it blended out good, but because I started with that brush
I think it's a little iffy. Moving on to the powders
I have it in Two and One. I'm going with Two which is a little more of a pinky tone and this time
I am using the brush that she has in her collection and in all honesty
I do really like this side of the brush. The sponge side,
I don't know, don't know if I'll ever use it.
But the little brush powdery side very much into so I don't really bake
So I'm just setting and then brushing off all of the loose powder because who has time to bake, okay? For brightening, look
I'm kind of getting impressed, for brightening
I also have it in One and Two
Two is the more pinky shade which is the shade that I'll be using and I started first with her duo end brush and
It was taking a long time, but it was definitely, look at that, like
You can just see the brightening happen which I'm super impressed with I have a lot of brightening powders and not a lot of them
Brighten like this, but I do think the better way to do it is use her like fatter fluffier brush
super duper impressed.
Didn't want to be. I do think that the
powders are a little better than the concealer. The baking powder is amazing. The brightening powder is
SUPER good! If I had to get one thing it'd be the brightening powder. Concealers,
I'm still working on them, but they're alright. This is long-winded. For powder
I'm using the La Mer powder, which I've only recently started using. I bought this on impulse once
And I just finally was like all right Nicole use this powder, so I do like the little puff
it comes with. It does kind of cast like a white shadow on me,
I feel like, when I first put it on, but you'll see when I brush it off, like all my color comes back.
I really like this powder because it sets everything in and still makes my skin look
dewy and not super dry and I'm really trying to wean myself off of the Mac Studio Fix because I do believe that powder
breaks me out. To bronze up the face. I am using the bronzing powder from Anastasia. I believe this is in the shade
Saddle and
Yeah, you know what to do here. I need a break from talking, okay? Contour your face.
For blush I'm on to my new fave
This is the Coquette blush duo from Jouer, but I tend to only use the Tease Me side
which is the lighter, pinkier side and, again, a little bit goes a long way be light-handed.
For highlight today, we're using Coco Bling from Artist Couture
And I first like to spray my face with a little bit of Fix Plus from Mac
Just to hydrate it a little bit 'cause I feel like it works really well with
pigmented highlights like this and these things are intense like it honestly shocked me right here, like, I was like
Oh my god
Did I put too much on? But you didn't, just give it a little buff out. These
highlighting powders are super gorgeous and Angel is a homie so I love supporting
And then anytime I highlight I always spray my Beauty Blender and dab over the highlight
Just really mesh everything and blend it into the skin
So you look natural.
You know? Well, kind of. I'm also gonna go over my collarbone and my shoulders with that same You Glow Girl like jelly
stuff that we used on our lids, and I'm gonna put it all over my body. Well, not like all over
I really wanted the body lava from Rihanna. It's not out yet, so I went with what I had. Alright, onto our last step
We were going to line our lips with Whirl lipliner. I know I'm not using Sebastian. I'm retiring him
I can't use him for like two months
I've decided. So we're just gonna line the lips
And then I like to fill mine in a little bit with the actual lip pencil. Going in with the shade
Pinkprint for Mac we're just going to put this on top
And then you can see there's like a harsh line between the lipstick and the lip liner
so I just like to take an eyeshadow brush or a lip brush whatever you want to use just make sure it's flat and I
Like to use this to diffuse the edges and make everything just blended and smooth
And then we're gonna go on top with a gloss because you know that's the life gloss life or no life
And I'm using oh just kidding. I am just kidding
What did I think I cannot do a lip look without putting 535 on top?
You know I should retire him. Him and Sebastian, you won't see them for a while
I lie.
For the gloss we are using Funfetti from Jouer to pop this on top. So after that this look is complete
I hope you guys enjoyed. I love you, and I will see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
