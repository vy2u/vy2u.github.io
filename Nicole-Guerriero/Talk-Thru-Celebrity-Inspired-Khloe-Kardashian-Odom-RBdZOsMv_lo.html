guys
before we get started on our celebrity
inspired makeup look ah yeah I dyed my
hair back dark I couldn't handle being a
light haired shouty anymore so I had to
go back dark um yeah I just did it at
home myself so I just wanted to get that
out of the way and yeah now we're gonna
get started I tweeted what kind of video
you guys would want to see tomorrow
today and lots of you guys want it to
see a Khloe Kardashian look and lots of
you guys sent me the same exact picture
which is this picture right here and I
just loved it
I loved her purple lip tint her simple
eye so I really liked the picture so
that's what I wanted to do today hence
the bareness up top but I promise have a
tube top on so I'm just gonna pull all
this hair up out of our way so that it
don't interfere with what we do it okay
so the first thing let me take off this
little ring so the first thing we're
gonna do is we're gonna prime our face I
keep looking at myself in the viewfinder
public oh I'm just gonna use the benefit
Porefessional because it's what I love
to use and then today I'm gonna go with
L'Oreal True Match I'm gonna use two
colors today I'm going to use w v and w
6w 5 for mainly the lighter places of my
face and then W 6 for the darker places
of our face
I love when I talk like this to you guys
and just look like this
um somebody asked why I wasn't using my
beauty blender they're just all dirty
and I need to go through and do a
serious brush wash because I've just
been being lazy like always but yeah
we're gonna wash all our brushes
probably tonight so you will see the
beauty belt look you will see the beauty
blender back in action soon but for
today I'm just gonna use my Sigma flat
top kabuki this is a great brush to use
as well if you like a really airbrushed
flawless finish so I'm just gonna blend
it all out it's bothering me back there
okay so now we're just going to quickly
fill in our brows you guys haven't seen
em you do this before so I'm gonna link
a brow or tutorial in the bottom bar and
probably somewhere right up in this area
just if you guys want to watch that just
so it's not taken me forever okay so now
we're gonna start working on our a bow
that's better right I feel like it was
looking a little dark so we're just
going to go in with our NYX wicked
dreams palette I'm gonna mix these two
colors together it's kind of like a
shimmery white and then kind of a little
shimmery pink and we're just going to
use this for our lid we're gonna pack
this color on because that's what it
looks like close got going on
it's going to take a little bit of soft
brown and kind of go in this crease a
little just kind of acts like a marker
so I know don't take your shadow up so
far then it looks like she has more of
like a brownie plummy color out on her
outside corner so the first thing we're
to do is just going to go in with this
like matte brownie color and we're gonna
work this out here I'm also going to
take this kind of like Lummi purple
color and we're going to work that right
there as well
go back with that fluffy brush and this
kind of blend it Alex her looks really
smooth layer on some more so we're just
going to use that same color from the
palette so I can't really tell from the
picture or not if she has a winged eye
um but they it doesn't seem like it and
if it is it's a really thin one so I'm
actually just gonna skip it for now
we're gonna go ahead and load on some
mascara cuz we're gonna put false lashes
on too and they're gonna do like a thin
band of liquid liner over our lashes
just to hide everything it is honestly
so hot it's probably like 90 degrees in
my house right now with the air on I'm
just gonna use my Pro Longwear comes
sell-off just gonna oh we'll type in
here and we're gonna put this underneath
our eyes she looks really bright
underneath here as always
because I want this to be like a really
bright eye I'm just going to use a
little bit of Max prepping time and
we're going to just put this right on
top of our concealer and then I'm just
going to use a foundation brush from
Sigma to blend this out so then to make
sure we don't have like any stark lines
like that I'm just going to take the
same foundation the same brush that we
used to put on our foundation or just
kind of tap it over use a little
translucent powder and set our under-eye
concealer now comes my favorite part the
contouring I'm just going to take a
little bit of hoola bronzer and a fluffy
brush like this this one's from BH
Cosmetics and in the picture Chloe's
like cheeks areas just look so rounded
and perfect so we're gonna fake that cuz
we can right I'm just going to give
myself a little smile and we're gonna
just follow our cheek the roundness of
our cheek emphasizing that apple
so then with our contour brush we're
just going to go in and kind of dark
knit blend out the line a little her
blush looks like a nudie kind of blush
so we're going to use a Mac Melba for
this and then I'm just going to add a
little bit of pink stone to it just to
give it a little more pink
I'm not going to blend that out yet
because I'm going to do a little
something in a second but I'm just going
in to contour my nose a little bit
because from the picture it looks like
clothes is pretty Pont or I just kinda
have this bump in it right here which
makes it hard for me to contour my nose
because I don't have a perfectly
straight is so I'm just gonna use the
same bronzer and I'm gonna looks like
hers kind of goes like this then I'm
just going it to take this contour
palette so the first one we gonna take
is just this white and kind of beige II
one and we're going to put this here
just to brighten and white in this area
kind of drag it all the way back is
going to make your contours and
highlight just stand out a lot more drag
it down this
so you're just going to want to mix
these two color we can blend all of this
out and to do that I'm just going to use
a stippling brush and the lashes that
I'm going to use today are from house of
lashes again this is my favorite pair
from house lashes it's attempted look
it's the temptress lash and it's just a
super super natural-looking lash
I can't really tell if Chlo has any like
hi car clothes like I know her I can't
tell if she has anything under her lower
lashline but I'm assuming that she does
I'm just gonna drag a little bit of this
like brown and this sparkly Brown I'm
gonna put this underneath here just to
balance out these lashes that we got
going and here I'm just going over doing
a little thin strip of liquid liner over
my lashes just to blend them in and make
them more undetectable we are almost
done we're just have our lip to do and
Chlo has kind of like a purpley pinky
lip in this picture so we're just going
it to mix and match some lipsticks and
hopefully we can get her lip down arts
color I want to start off with is
Maybelline's and make me pink
and I'm going to take a little bit of
max a rebel and just tap it on your lip
just kind of blend it out with your
finger that'll help mix the colors
pretty good so because we're doing the
Khloe Kardashian inspired look the only
thing that's missing is Khloe's mole
which usually they Photoshop offer for
face which I don't know why cuz I love
it so we are going to give ourself one
and hers is kind of in this area let me
look
and then personally that drive for a sec
so we can powder over it and make it
look real I'm just going to take a
little bit of a powder and powder over
this tada
I can't I can't do my hand like her I
would pose like the picture but I have
like awkward pinky so not happening but
that is it that is the end of our okay
Biebs okay so that's everything to
achieve our celebrity inspired Khloe
Kardashian look thank you guys for
