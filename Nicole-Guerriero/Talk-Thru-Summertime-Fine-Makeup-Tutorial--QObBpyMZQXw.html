nighttime makeup that I wear when I go
out that I've been wearing the past
couple of weeks usually when I go out at
night like I wear like dark makeup and
stuff like that like on my eyes but
recently I've been switching it up and
going more towards goals so the first
thing that I'm gonna do is take my
secret poor rich balm I'm almost
completely out of it but I'm just gonna
put this all over my face you can use
any kind of primer you want or you can
actually skip a primer but I always must
wear a primer eyebrows needs to be done
girl
okay so moving on to foundation I'm
gonna be using my L'Oreal True Match
Lumi foundation I really love this stuff
for a night because it kind of gives me
like a glowy appearance but I do have
oily skin so when I do put this on a
night I do make sure that I always keep
some kind of blotting papers or
something because this can tend to get a
little oily because it is the lumi one
so make sure you shake this foundation
up good and the way that I put it on is
I just pop some dots onto my face
I like a big red dot on the middle of my
forehead right now
so once you're all blotted like this
then I'm going to take my real technique
stippling brush and just blend this all
in
I'm gonna just move on to my brows and
I'm using my Anastasia Anastasia brow
pencil or this is the brow Wiz this is
my favorite pencil that she actually
makes just a double-ended so that's one
side and then hit like a little spooley
on the other so then you just brush out
the brows
face up in my face but you're blocking
the soul
okay so then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take one of these color tattoo
24-hour shadows by Maybelline and this
is a new color bold gold and I'm just
going to use my finger and apply this on
my lid I'm just putting it this gold
base down to hold this shadow a little
better and to make it a little more
vibrant I'm gonna take the color of
midnight cowgirl which is this nice like
gold shimmery color right here and I'm
just going to put this all on the lid
and then into up to the crease and then
down a little onto the tear ducts
we are gonna go into the naked palette
and we're going out to use the color
buck I'm sure all of you guys have seen
buck now we're gonna put this right into
the crease
and then just with a large fluffy brush
we're screwing it to blend it out to
make sure there's no harsh lines and
that it's really soft virgin from The
Naked palette I'm just wanting it to
highlight with that same brush so there
might be some midnight cowgirl on here
which is fine then we're going to line
our eyes and I use two different kinds
of eyeliners when I do my winged
eyeliner I like to use the Maybelline
Line stiletto for the top line and then
I like to use the Urban Decay 24/7 for
the winged out part and it's always
better if you can ink our staple tanker
if you can stabilize your elbow that
will make putting your liquid liner on a
lot easier
so then I'm going to just go in with the
color loss which is just like a it's a
brown color that's got a little bit of
shimmer in it and we're going to take
this pretty low underneath our lash line
right here
I'm gonna use the eve Perl dual salmon
concealer in fair light you guys know
this this stuff is amazing and I'm also
gonna take a sigma round top mini brush
precision round brush p12 what is it P
82 because I already have my eye makeup
on I always do the triangle concealer at
night just brings a lot of light to your
face and I think it looks better
and I'm gonna set my under eye concealer
with my banana powder just flew out
everywhere I'll put the link in the
bottom bar of where you can get this I
know a lot of people always ask about it
and they're not sure where they can get
it online and whatnot I put a link down
below and where I got mine and somebody
told me the best way to apply the banana
powder is to apply it with a damp sponge
so that's what I've been doing I just
take my Beauty Blender squeeze it dip it
right in there kind of get the excess
off and then pop it under my eye
so thanks to whoever was one of my
subscribers that left that in one of the
comment sections I want my last video so
if you told me to use the banana pan or
with a wet sponge I thank you now I'm
just gonna do a little bit of contour
blush and we're almost done
Sedona lace dome brush and then the
hoola bronzer by benefit which is
honestly amazing so I'm just going to
use my BH Cosmetics palette and I'm
gonna mix kind of these two colors
together to get nice little cheek what
is this oh this is the betty lou manizer
from the balm and it's like so amazing
i'm just taking like a small elf brush
because I want to control it a little
more and the worst one to highlight on
the highest points of our cheekbone and
then a little right above the brow we're
almost done
then I'm just going to view out my lips
a little bit cuz they're looking a
little red I'm gonna take this Rimmel
lip liner and it's called East End snob
new delight
before I put my gloss on I'm gonna take
my Neutrogena shine control powder and
I'm just going it to dust my face a
little and then finally we're gonna
leave it top it all off with a gloss and
I'm using the this is by Revlon and the
color is crystal lilac and this is our
finished look so I've been loving like
this look a lot lately just peachy
cheeks and a nude lip it just feels like
really like summertime fine to me so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
until next time I'll talk to you guys
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
