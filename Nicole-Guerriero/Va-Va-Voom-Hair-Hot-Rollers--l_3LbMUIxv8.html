in 160 grams in number two dark brown
I'm just going to brush through my hair
and the hair extensions carefully um
before we start curling and if you guys
want to see how I clip in my hair
extensions just click that video right
there and it'll take you to it alright
so once your hair is nice and brushed
out just go ahead and part it how you
normally do if you part it on the side
or if you part it down the middle so I
go in with my two thumbs and take this
front portion first and I'm not somebody
that's super even with my hair like I
don't really like I like messy hair so
if it's not perfectly even it's not
gonna kill me I'll just brush it out and
I'm gonna take a large purple one these
are really hot um so if you need to use
like a glove or something I would
recommend it because I burn my fingers
almost everytime I use these but like my
fingers are pretty used to being burned
so just do that one and then these I
love these clips and we'll just clip
them in like that you said I mean like I
don't care like if this little piece is
like falling out or whatnot
so take this back piece try not to do
this win like you've got free fresh
clean hair I would do this when your
hair is a little dirtier because it'll
give you a curl like more holds and if
you do it like when your hair is like
freshly cleaned like I do sometimes
you'll get like indentations like where
your clips are in your hair because like
fresh clean hair but you can just go
through with your straightener and try
those out like if I haven't in my hair
I'll show you how to do it so we're just
going down the back really quick I just
do these first three with my big purple
ones I'm so tall and then just curl them
down curl them down roll them down like
that so I put my first three on top and
then I'll separate my hair and then just
start curling this way so I'm going to
throw myself into fast-forward so that
this isn't a 45 minute one video and
then it will let them cool and I'll come
back when I'm all set so
I can watch you for

Hollywood treasure
just a wee
all right so once you have all your
rollers in your hair and I have hair
extensions in and everything and I still
didn't use I still have one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fourteen
rollers still so if you have a ton of
hair this is like a great roller set for
you so I'm gonna let these set for
probably like 20 minutes or so until
they're completely completely cool um
and then I will come back and in vail so
yeah I'll see you guys
well I'll see you guys in like one
second but really 20 minutes so be back
so we're waiting for these curlers
sucess so I'm gonna come in here and
make something to eat but I don't know
what I want to eat
should this be like an episode of cribs
or I'll show you what's in my freezer
where do I want a pizza hmm maybe a
liitle pizza maybe no pizza notice what
Oh something a drink mmm I don't know
I'll figure something out okay so these
should be completely cool so we're just
going to go ahead and take them out
forever
Oh
so then once all of your curls are out
and you kind of about like this crazy
situation going I'm just going to flip
and kind of like a finger comb through
so just kind of pull your curls out a
little and then flip them back
and then as you can see like my hair is
kind of freshly washed so the top of my
hair like it's all funky cuz I curl them
not under on the top of my head and curl
them back the other way because I want
my bangs to flip backwards so then you
kind of get like this weird little funky
crown situation and I'll just go through
with my hair straightener and then pick
up where I kind of you guys can see that
it's kind of like little weirdness and
then I'll just pick up and then run my
straightener over the top of that and
then it goes away completely like that
and then you just have like these
voluminous like I don't know like I
don't know what I like so much about
like curling iron curls by like love
love that not curling iron curls hot
roller curls it just seemed so much more
and then I just like how like all this
looks so that is how I hot roll and then
this is the gorgeous hair that you come
up with oh I think that's all I want to
say so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and until next time I'll talk to
you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
