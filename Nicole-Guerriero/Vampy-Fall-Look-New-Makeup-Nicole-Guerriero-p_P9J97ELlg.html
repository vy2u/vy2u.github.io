Where do i start so if you Guys have Been watching the weather or the news or whatever you Guys
Know That florida Got Smoked By a hurricane This past weekend hurricane irma
So originally We Thought we were gonna have to Worry about the hurricane because We thought It was going to hit more on the east
Coast Of florida But Somehow It made its Way Around and came Up Towards the tampa area
Luckily By The time It got to us it was Only a Category two so we Got super duper Lucky
We had like a small hole in the roof and we Have a couple of Downed Trees like Big privacy trees
and We Lost Power for about twelve Hours but i feel like We Got super Lucky in This storm Because Like my mom
Jeremy's Mom Basically Anybody That i know it doesn't Have power Right Now
People on the Road over don't have power so i Just Feel super Lucky and grateful that We Have Power
It's Just Been a Little Hectic these past Few Days
And i originally wanted to come back to you guys and do Halloween videos but because of the hurricane the mail has Been
Impacted a Little Bit so i'm missing a Few things that i need to create like My first look and
I do Have Other Things that i could create Right Now but i
Have this look Stuck in my Head and i Feel like i have to do that first?
you Know like I Feel like i can't move on until i do that look so
Hopefully i will Get my Stuff soon i did get a package Today so that Was Good news Um and
yeah
It was Scary That Night of the hurricane the sky was lighting Up like Green and blue because i
Transformers were Blowing The Wind was with being so intense and since we didn't
Have Any Power It Was superduper quiet in the house so you could Hear the Wind so crazy
Again i Just Feel super Lucky My Thoughts and prayers are with anybody that Was like
Super Impacted By This storm and of Course Harvey Harvey i think Was Way worse Than
Emma Because It Just Kind of Sat Over texas for Like five Days and irma Just Kept It Moving
Obviously The southern Part of florida Got
Impacted a Lot more so if you guys Feel it in your souls to donate please. Do so People lost everything so
Like i said i wanted to come back With Halloween video
Videos
So like i said i wanted to come back With Halloween videos but since i can't do my first look i figured that i would
Come on here use a Bunch of Whole New Makeup that i got and do like a Very Classic fog lamps is Now upon us
but I Feel like florida never Really Gets Fall
Hey i'm growing out my eyebrows okay so please
Nobody tell me that i need to pluck them because i know this is usually the stage where like i give up
but I'm trying to hold strong I'm trying to hold strong
But They Just look so rash Yeah
I know okay so there's no need something there's something Else that i wanted to tell you that is oh Then i will be at?
Generation Beauty New York on September 23rd with a lancome at 12:30 i'm super Excited
I think Generation Beauty is like One of The most well put together Kind of Beauty Functions
I've never Been to the one in new York i've Been to a couple in la so i'm Excited for This one so if you
Guys are gonna be there i would love to see you and squeeze you even harder Than i normally do Because
I'm Feeling Very grateful These Days especially for you Guys Um there
Is that all that i wanted to tell you guys before we Jump in and. Look at them again Here
okay again please no comments about eyebrows i know you Guys are gonna leave comments about These Brows
to non-matching Books too
so you Guys might hang out with me for like the next 15 minutes or so while i do my Makeup i
Love You Forever
Also My Skin Like i Swear that it's Been like doing so much Better Than It usually has i think a Lot has to do
With The Amount of Water i've Been Drinking i know It seems like an Easy step but i have up to my water intake so?
So much and i definitely think It Helps Course i knew that i wanted to fill my video this weekend my Skin Was like okay?
we're gonna Get Crazy look at my eyebrows
Um so yeah i've Got a few Breakouts Happening i
Honestly Think It Was Just Like stress and i've Been eating Kind of Bad the past couple of Days Because
It Was like hurricane weather you know couldn't Go out Couldn'T do anything how do you like Chips pasta
okay
mmm so
Let'S start
So to start This off
I'm gonna use the korres Wild rose smoothie Brightening
Priming Moisturizer a Lot of This Stuff is new i've never used before so this is definitely New and never used this before
but You know me if this has Brightening i'm like yes
Roses yes
So it's a prime Today i'm going to use the fenty Beauty soft Matte pro filter This is an Eat instant retouch Primer
I swatched it on my hand and i wasn't sure about it's like Kind of
Mm Liquidy i Guess Would Be like a Good Word for it but
Hopefully It's Supposed to Kind of smooth you out and fill in pores but Usually primers to me that Feel like This don't?
Smooth me as much as i would Like
Brows I
Originally Was Supposed to go to new York and go to the fenty Beauty lodge
And i have plane Tickets and Everything and Then This hurricane Was like nah?
You ain't going to the Fenty pu Launch and i was like okay so i had to cancel My flight and stay
Home to prep for this hurricane Because It Was like the walking Dead Out Here like There was Water nowhere Gasps?
Nowhere and This is When they didn't even know iF the storm wasn't gonna come up on our side
It was Just Wild Out here like
The Hunt for Water Was real
Really Real
So for foundation we're going to use the pen tv
Pro filter Soft Matte long Wear a foundation and I'm using it in the shade 280 which might be a little
Dark For me at this moment so i may have to Jay's gonna blend It all down Here but this is the shade
That I'm going with okay so i heard that This Was a Full coverage foundation But then i saw
Like Some Mixed Reviews Saying It's not Really full coverage so we
Shall see i'm Just gonna use it on the Beauty Blender
This might Be full coverage so i'm noticing that it's drying Kind of quickly
Okay again i think it Dries a Little quickly so you might want to work on one side of the face at a time Which
I mean is usually What i do Anyway
But Like You probably Wouldn'T want to like dot It all over your face okay so far so good i like it
Alright I'm gonna do These Brows off-camera cuz
okay it's not as Bad as it was
So we're gonna use this too Faced
Just Peachy Matt's palette
Never used It i don't remember Really The last time i even use like a Too Faced
Eyeshadow palette So hopefully This One's Good
starting to take This shade Here Which is Peach cobbler i Just wanted to show you Guys the amount of Fallout so
And we're gonna Work that in our crease area
So i'm Just picking Up more product and Adding a Little Bit at a Time
but so far i mean
There's a Good decent Amount of Fallout in the Shadow Like on the palette but not really a Lot on my face and
These Guys are Pretty Pigmented. Too and They're Blending Pretty Good
I'm gonna take This shade Just right and
Adding that to the outer corner of my Eye Just
Using The Same Brush and Just Kind of The same Thing that i have Been Doing Just picking up a Little Bit of product at
A time to ensure that Things don't Get Crazy
I'm then Just taking a Clean Brush to Kind of Buff Up those outer edges and then Moving on we're gonna go in to
Peach tart Which is like This darker Chocolatey Brown color and a Flat Brush and we're going to pack That
on the outer corner as well Just Kind of Keeping This guy a Little Bit lower so
Then I'm gonna take This solar flare palette from bh and i'm gonna use i think a lactic Which is this like
Cranberry Color Here we're gonna put that Just on our lid
I'm Just using the shade dry but if you want it to be like
Super intense and Like more metallic you can Wet Your Brush with a Little fix+
And it'll Just give It like more oh but i feel like It wasn't need it
For Lashes I'm gonna Use these Guys from Velour i'm not sure their name but it'll be in the bottom bar
You Know i'm gonna use my tart Shape tape best concealer in the Whole Wide World i don't know What they do to it
but It Really is the best if you have not tried this concealer
Try It use the shade a light medium you're like it's the only shade
That Really Works for me cuz it's good at Concealing and Like Really Brightening This area
and then you know i'm gonna set With My laura mercier Secret Brightening Powder
so it's really the only
Like Powder That i ever used underneath my eyes it's really Like The only Thing That Works for me but does that Make it Just
Look Like to dry under there i can't use any Kind of Like Translucent powder
It's Just
So i always use a Really light hand
When i set my under Eyes i
Think It Helps so much i set my face with this Peach blur it's supposed to be a translucent smoothing finishing powder
So i'm gonna set My face with This
and See how that Works out
and I Feel like The powder actually did Help smooth Out my face a Little Bit
for Blush we're gonna use this guy from Hourglass Which is their strobe lighting Blush in Euphoric effusion i
Like to wear these Blushes When i don't really want to do a Lot of Highlight Because There's a Little Bit of Highlight in the
Blush Which Just Like Gives you like This Natural Looking Glow
So then For the lower lash line we're gonna take a Little Bit of
Peach Sangria and a Flat Brush and Just Run That across and then we're gonna take like a Tiny Little
Fluffy Brush and Just smoke That Out a Little Bit more
so i'm gonna take this buxom pencil this Is and call me and This Is a Waterproof Eyeliner and i'm going to put it on
My Lower waterline as Well as My upper waterline
I'm also gonna take That pencil and Just Run It right underneath My lower lash line like superduper close and then Just Blend it out
With Like a Flat Shader Brush with a Little Bit of Brown Shadow Just Again for like a more Smoky look
Alright Next we're gonna set The brows and i'm going to use you know my all-time favorite
This Is a Gimme Brow and I'm using it in the shade
3 but sometimes i use it in the Shade 5 i go between 5 3 &amp;amp; 4
