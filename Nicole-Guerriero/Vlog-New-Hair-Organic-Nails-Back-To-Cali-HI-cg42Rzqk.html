what my mom sounds so like less spoke of
a calf the better word funny thing about
talking behind my back is that it just
keep coming back to me
good how are you
no that was it thank you and we're out
of here
I miss one mother hasn't seen her in
days my anaconda don't want none unless
you got buns on my hair sown in and it's
not like a like a traditional sewing she
took these like little silicone beads
and put them on like strands of hair
like this big like all the way across
like a row and then she took like a huge
west of hair like that you buy two so
and so it's like one ginormous piece and
that she just would measure it to the my
like circumference on my head which is
quite large and then she would just so
that like left in to the silicone beads
all the way through and at first I was
like oh god what did I do so it was kind
of sore the first day like first day you
get a so it on your hair or any kind of
permanent extension it's a little sore
the first thing it's really close to
your scalp but this is what I got it
done I did Saturday Sunday Monday so it
tastes Tuesday and I honestly Rick can't
even feel that when I sleep when I first
got the hose like oh my god what do they
do
I should have just stuck to clippings
but actually I don't mind them so much
now you can actually get in between them
and like wash your scalp which is like
super important to me I have a few like
tapings in my hair as well
just cuz we wanted to add like a little
bit of like a different color in to
break it up a little I feel like I'm
gonna remove because I have one right
here I feel like I'm gonna take this one
out because when I just rub my fingers
through my hair right there I keep
catching it and it's pissing me off
so I might take that one out but I don't
I like I like
but it's really flat to our surprise
like when I run my hand out the back of
my head like you can't you can't really
tell oh I mean I could tell because it's
in my hair my hair they wouldn't tell ya
go to her she looks so tiny because she
couldn't get off the ground</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
