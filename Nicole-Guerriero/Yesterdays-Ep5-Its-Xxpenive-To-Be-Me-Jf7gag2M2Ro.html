Got the TV in this one. I was talking about that
I want the apps on so hopefully we can get this hung up some point today. I just got out of the shower, so I'm gonna go blowdry my hair
This hair takes me forever to do. That's why usually when I have tape-in extensions
I just get blowouts because it's just so much easier because I'm not joking [this] [hair] it takes a long time to blow-dry
[um] so then after I
What is going on with my hair right now? Okay? We're not even -  I'm just gonna. I'm just going to go with it
*Turns on hairdryer*
All right, we are blown out. We are straightened. So, now I'm just going to fake um like a blowout
look to my hair. I just use this old-school curling iron, which I've had for a really long time
It's pretty beat up. *Music - (Okay. You got to feel that cool though. Oh now. You got to camp)
(Oh now you want to laugh oh?)
 
All right, let me put some eye make-up on now, or well not even eye-makeup just some Mascara cos I am looking *Whispers - &amp;quot;like an alien!&amp;quot;
I know I said it in my last
Video that. I just want to tell you guys again
Thanks for all the love that you guys been showing on the Vlog's it really is like encouraging to me to know that
you guys are into them and
It just makes me feel like more motivated to do it because I was really
REALLY lacking motivation to do makeup videos
they just felt like so phony like I
Don't know like I'm not knocking anybody that does make-up videos obviously I did them for almost seven  years - Um
Actually seven years were in may right? No, we're not in may yet.I think like May something is my seven year YouTube anniversary
so I'm super excited start this new chapter with you guys and just
Feel like - I feel excited to film again. I feel excited to edit videos again, so
Yeah, I just want to say thank you.
I feel like I can finally say too that my lashes
After getting lash extensions ONE time in my life - one time.
And I had them on for legit like three days because I couldn't take them
They messed my lashes up sooo bad like for the longest time I had no lash like whatsoever
Even on days like this when I don't, like when I wouldn't wear a lot of makeup
I've had to put like fake lashes on because I didn't have any kind of lash
I-I don't even know how long ago that was either like at least three or four years ago
And I'm finally feel like my lashes are back to normal
after
years
I saw a lot of suggestions for like what I should drink from Starbucks and people are telling you that white Mocha has
Dairy in it and i was like oh what the F**k even the girl was like &amp;quot;oh, you're trying to cut out dairy?&amp;quot; and I was like &amp;quot;Yeah&amp;quot;
And she's like well, this is a good option like she didn't tell me that the damn white Mocha had
dairy in it like what da f**k, what da hell (laughs) and you guys remember my
video from Like A million years ago
I did a video called bomb.com lashes, and it's just about layering Mascara to really give you like a full effect
So I am back to doing that I use three Mascaras
So much better
Somebody's told me too that I should not wear my eyebrows so dark
And I'm just like are we still telling people what they should and shouldn't do with their own faces in
2017 like we're still doing that. I want to wear my dark ass eyebrows because I like them
just let me you know
just let me
(English accent) Good afternoon, it's around two-thirteen
We are going to go grab some lunch
Um, we're going to try somewhere in Clearwater. You want a lil bit of seafood is that what it is? &amp;quot;yeah&amp;quot;
Yeah, so we're gonna go down too Clearwater beach to try and find some
Grilled sandwiches - clearly what he's in the mood for and then?
Can we go to Home goods?
Maybe...
What the hell....
*whispers* We're going to Home Goods
Its 92 degrees today it's getting hot very very hot
I'm not really that hot though, to be honest
He just got done working out though that's why. *mumbling*
I don't know if you can hear us over the air conditioning
That was good. Jeremy - &amp;quot;That was good.&amp;quot;
Lip Syncing
Jeremy - &amp;quot;Look at that out there!&amp;quot;
Jeremy - &amp;quot;Beautiful!&amp;quot;
We'll be out there on Sunday. Jeremy - &amp;quot;It's our playground&amp;quot;
Lip Syncing
We're going to Home Goods!
No couch luck at Home Goods it's only  because I'm searching for a couch that I can't find one.
Hey George
What are you doing up there?
Singing
We're not going to the gas station, it say's I got 43 miles till we are empty
So my mama's house is not that far away from me
we're going - screw it
When you got that one hair in your mouth. I think it's actually one of Jeremy's beard hairs - Oh no it was my hair - it was mine! It was mine!
*Coughing*
Umm ma'am, ma'am stay in your lane. Yeah, yeah you.
No, luck with the couch. I feel like I'm going to have to order one online
But I like to sit on the couch before I but it, it's hard for me to buy furniture online
You know when I do buy furniture online
I will go to the store first, sit in it, see how it feels before I purchase it online
cos most of the time I buy my furniture online. I'm a tall girl. Jeremy's a tall man. So we have make sure that our couches
Don't make us feel like giants
Like I can't fuck with Ikea furniture cos I just feel like the jolly green giant, Jack in the Beanstork, w'e're just marching through Ikea like
*Slow motion - DUN, DUN, DUN, DUN, DUN SMASH COUCH
Like that's how it feels there - I'm just too tall for IKEA furniture in general
(English accent) So I'm not having much luck finding a pink couch
(English accent) I feel like I've got to let my pink couch dreams go and just go with a basic color couch.
(English accent) Which I don't like at all
(Enlgish accent) not at all not
Who knows, I'm going to put it out there, just putting it out. Ask, believe, receive put pink couch vibes out in to the universe
the universe hasn't let me down... yet (laughs)
*Singing*
No, no, no we can't even listen to Ja Rule in here
Cos you guys saw all that stuff about like the fire festival right? Like he was hosting in the Bahamas and tickets were like
4,000 dollars and now it's like the biggest joke like they are stuck out there on the island no performer
they're just in like these boujie tents like, I don't know
It's pretty intense. So it's the festival that never was. So, NO. No Ja Rule today.
*Lip Syncing*
*Lip Syncing*
That's reserved for cleaning otherwise it gets to live in the vehicle
*Lip Syncing* - How many fucks do I give?
It's expensive to be me
It's really not! It's really not expensive to be me. (laughs)

Um so like I have the older version which I still use which we take our pictures on but we have the Sony
A7s and we just got the Sony
A7r - 2
I can't keep up. This is a stabilizer so that we can get super smooth shots when I unbox it and take it out
I'll [show] it to you guys
I don't know how to say the name, so I'm not going to say the name
but I watched a ton of reviews on YouTube, but of course and
That had the best review so I'm excited to use it hopefully we can get it balanced and in
Motion because once upon a time. I bought the steadicam which is a super expensive stabilizer for that guy sitting right there
but I could not get it balanced me and Beebz tried and I could not
Not get any so hopefully
That guy doesn't give me as much problem, and I can get it stable so we can get like these
You know like super smooth shots

Can't get it open. Oh, it's closed, that's why. Oh
Man, it's magical
Got a little glow Palette from Violet Voss. Oh he's hefty he is large and in charge. It's really heavy like
And this is the rose gold palette and look at the size of those things! It kind of looks like my palette though (laughs)
Right? It's cool though because it looks like the pallets are removable, so if you ran out of a certain colour it looks like you can,
Yep pop it in and pop it out
That is why he weighs a little more because he's magnetic
So this palette is available on May 4th,  the size of these pans
Huge.
This is a new child to join the family it is the A7R-2
