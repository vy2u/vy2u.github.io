It's around probably like 10:15
10:10 i think it says over there
um, we are gonna go, we're gonna take the jet-skis
out today so Jeremy went to go gas them up.
He went to run to Publix, to get some
grapes, water, sandwiches,
So I don't know if you guys can tell, but
I feel like that mask really lightened up these blemishes
a lot, they're all super flat now
which, praise Jesus!
I'm excited to get out on the water
get out in the sun
I need to find my SPF because
Your girl's not trying to burn out there okay? Okay.
The drone is joining us for this Sunday
Say it again Nicole
Um, and I feel it, I'm gonna get some good drone shots today you guys
I'm gonna get some good drone shots
It's just fruit punch
Sunday Funday is coming to an end
I gotta get home, I got shit to edit
Sir?
He was getting crazy out there guys,
He was getting Cra-Zy
He cut his head! You guys saw that
He cut his freakin head! His key hit him
Check out the fingers, you got a nice
You got a little cut on your fings?
Not on the filanges!
Hey, will you um, preheat the um, that oven and put all that pizza in there?
Yes.
Yes
I haven't had any alcohol, for the record
Sunday Funday's are just fucking fun!
Did you miss me?
Yeah
Hello my babies
Oh I love when you stretch
My eyes burn so bad!
I got so much sunscreen in my eyes
P.S I don't drink, when driving the jetski's
I'm a grandma, I'm scared. Safety first!
Arrive alive okay?
Um so I don't drink, um when we're out there
But looking at myself on here, it looks like I'm drunk
So I had, I put so much sunscreen on
That I don't have any kind of, oh,
Hook it up! Chandelier
Okay I started with SPF 30 and I ended with SPF 70
Okay! I'm not trying to burn out in these streets
So, I was thinking, I love the daily vlogs, I'm super into it
I'm super excited
But I think it's gonna be a six day a week vlog
I'm gonna need Sundays off
Because, I feel, unless, I don't know
Unless I get good footage from that Sunday
But I'm thinking that maybe Sunday, is the day of rest
Even though it's actually Sunday funday
How many times can we say Sunday funday?
Sunday Fuuuuuunday!
Um, I'm thinking that I might take Sundays off
Just to kind of recoup, think about what we're gonna do
And have that one day of the week that I know
That I don't have to rush, cause we literally
I was like, we have got to go. I've got a video
to upload, I've got shit to do
Um, but, let me know if you guys are cool with me taking
Sundays off
Cause uh, I think it would be better for all of us
But if we do have something cool happening on a Sunday
Then, a video will go up if its worthy
But I feel like you guys might get tired of Sunday Funday
If it might be a little repetitive
With the skis of anarchy crew (laughs)
I'm heating up the oven, cause we have some leftover pizza
Even though I like cold pizza,
Does anybody else like cold pizza? Jeremy doesn't like
Cold pizza but I think cold pizza is way better
than hot pizza so imma eat my shit cold
So I don't know how long todays video is actually going to be
But hey, it's a video, so I will see you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
