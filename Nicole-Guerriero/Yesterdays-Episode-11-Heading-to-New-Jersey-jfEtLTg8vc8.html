I was editing this video for over like three hours
And then [final] [cut] froze,  came back all the clips were gone a fully edit videos were gone. [I] just started crying
So final cut like hides your files
in like an untitled file like in your backups folder
So I actually found the whole edited video a couple of those things a couple of the clips weren't there
But that's okay. It was better than editing the whole video over again. So it's like nine now. I went to bed at two.
I'm just finishing up editing this video, and I didn't pack yesterday. I have to pack today we leave for Jersey tonight
We leave at I think [our] flights at like 7:00 tonight
So I got to go get a blowout at 11:45
Even though I got the project back, and I [did] have to re-edit everything. I was still like
So I think there's the video came back, I just went to the room
and laid down.. in the same shirt, so we'll change eventually but I'm just not finished editing this video
And then I'll see you guys at the car
love you [ blows kisses]
So it's around 11:20. I'm going to get my hair blown out. I was debating whether or not I wanted to but
I think I need it
There's so much time to build out of hair
I noticed that I grab this little
Chin a lot I would you like to get over [anytime] today? Thank you
Biebes is going to get a hair cut at
one like I said we leave for jersey tonight, so [we] probably have to leave around like
Five or so tonight. We don't get to Jersey til' I think Ten o'clock
tonight We like to take a later flight out usually whatever we can [anywhere], we're going
just because I hate getting up really early and rushing around in the morning and feeling like I got to keep the cast like in a
Rush so [whenever] we can we take a late flight and there was only  two non-stop flights to Jersey
And the other one got in really, i think it was in at like nine a.m. this morning and I was like &quot;that is a little to early for your girl&quot;... so
We don't get there until Ten tonight. It's going to be a quick trip. I think we're only with them. We come back Sunday
Night, I believe ... but
Excited to see mom's ..... I haven't seen her in TWO MONTHS!
Mom... I don't like that shit.
So I had a meltdown last night.. were I  thought my footage was gone
The word that I keep saying myself [overs] over
Again persevere like just keep going keep going keep going keep going keep going keep going keep going
So I'm like sitting in the room like crying
persevere because I thought I was going to have to edit the whole video again
It took me like 30 or so minutes to find where my footage was hiding
I couldn't find the footage
And then I started editing again
and then I just get so [upset] that I have to start adding the whole video again that I go and try to search for
You find it and when I found it. It was like the heavens opened up
I just stepped from the computer.. as soon as it loaded into final cut like I said a few of the clips were missing and like
But as soon as it loaded on to final cuts
I just stepped away from the computer and took my ass to bed because I was like &quot; I just feel stressed out&quot;
Like i felt like it drained me so much and then when I got up this morning. I was like
Iaughing
Don't know if any of you watching have ever edited a video, but it takes a decent amount of time
And I don't know if any of you watching have ever lost the project that you're working on
It has happened to me in my Youtube career
Plus completely can't retrieve it like twice like my computer crashed and I've had to get a new computer
it's like
Your stomach falls out your butt or something...
It's just horrible, but I know it sounds super dramatic
But when you spend so much time into something is it it's like gone. You're like
whatttttt
but the editing gods were on my side last night and I found it and
You're recovered and you guys are going [to] watch this day
But by the time you are viewing this, you would have watched it yesterday
and you see the days are confusing. The days are confusing. I feel like I need to get a massage.
sitting at my computer desk
ugh... my back hurts
singing
singing
Alright. That's all the country I had in me for today
My Hairstylist said she is running a few minutes late so I am going to try and drive slow the rest of the way there
though she said she got me a quinoa chocolate cupcake, so.....
I guess I'll let her slide
I still haven't even packed because I told you I know myself to well
I'll be like you're going to pack you're going to pack you're going to pack I finish laundry last night which was good
But I just knew I have so much time that my body was like you're not packing girl. Why you lying for yourself?
Why are you lying to yourself?
So I still have to pack. I'm freaking hungry man!
where am [I] what rode what street did I turn on?
Were we on
38th. Okay, I think we're good...
Conversation...
Nothing like a fresh blood out am I right I am right
Couldn't eat my cupcake in there cuz you know where's be bullshit. I need a pack
and eat this cupcake. It's a quinoa cupcake... so good.
[ phone conversation ]
That was a good cupcake.  I'm trying to think of what I need to do.
I need to upload my video, and schedule it to go live
You need to remember to do that [nicole].. Make sure my computer is fully charged
and camera Batteries are fully charged... SD
cards on Deck... Drone
Why don't we get a green light?
Sir, how do you feel about not getting a green light? so I think this is my 11th day in a row
Vlogging
and I just have to say that I am honestly so blown away by the love and
Support that you guys have [shown] on the vlogs like it
Just means so much to me you guys have no idea and I'm bad at putting it into words
[so] just thank you from the bottom
Of my heart the top of my heart the side of my heart my whole heart just thank you
Thank you
Okay, which way do I need to go? I'm confused this way
Yeah, let's go. This way [I]
Think [I] came from that way though. I've lived here my whole life and I [am] so bad at directions
I don't know how people lived life without having maps on their phone
And they have to actually look at a map and I go to the number and go down and I try to find their places
like
I have no sense of direction
I have direction yeah towards the mall
What movie is that from?!
ohh... There is a police officer infront of us
no wonder everyone is driving like Ms. Daisy
I ran out of room
So I don't really know what I'm packing. I'm just
Throwing a [bunch] of black items into a bag
Usually [we] don't do much. We just kind of hang out and enjoy each other's time
Think it's so cold in Jersey. I think it's going to be raining
While we're there, which I don't mind it's so sunny in Florida all the time that actually love the rain
I think that I could move to like seattle or something and just live in the rain constantly. I love it. All right
I think I got enough clothes on here. Now i need to go pack my make up
Sometimes I think maybe I shouldn't put this apple TV in here
This is everything that I'm going to take with me
I'm not going to bring any eyeshadow palettes because I'm just going to use cars palettes
But this is everything [that] I am bringing with me and we're going to put it all in this little bag
Can she do it?
like a g and in case you're wondering I do just have some lip glosses that I take with me that are in a
Carry-on bag that comes with me. I really want to die that wig when I get back
We'll dye it together. [so] [I] heard you can use like Fabric Dye on synthetic wigs
Since it's like a fabric. It's not hair you know it's synthetic
[so] yeah, because I want to dye it pink. [I] may be like blue [woo], but I think I only have pink dye somewhere
Anyways um I just finished packing
We're leaving here in about an hour. I'm probably gonna have to edit on the plane
that would be smart of you yeah, I'll probably see you. I'll probably see you at the airport
I'll see you at the airport
try to match my socks when I go to the airport, so
cat mermaids seemed
seemed to fit
Why is it rainin'? it would rain the day. I get a blowout.. right?
whoa
I don't know where the rain came from... i don't appreciate it, but I'm sure the earth appreciates it
Our flight is delayed
When you and beiebs can't sit next to each other...
mom, mommm. you look so good. I've had hiccups for the past 45 minutes and they won't go away
Can i get an autograph?
