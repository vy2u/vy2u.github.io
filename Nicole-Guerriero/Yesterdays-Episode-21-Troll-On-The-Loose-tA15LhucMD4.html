Oh I got a headache
I thought New York City was loud, Cuba is loud! Okay, it is LOUD. Yeah I feel like I'm still asleep, so I will see you guys in the city.
It's hot as f*ck in this airport.
Jeremy: Hot!!
So if I look a little grumpy...
it's 'cause I am.
They've got this air pumping on Delta right now.
Thank you!!
I'm so hungry, I'm so hungry!!!
Ketchup.
Delta Airlines: Hi, hello welcome aboard Delta flight's 620 service to New York's JfK international Airport,
you're ready to go up front front all check lists are complete,
and it looks like the cargo door is being closed as we speak,
And looks like what have an on-time 44 or 45 minutes
I've lined up today's [to] our [fort] four minutes of my time, and I've been a pretty smooth ride all day today
So we'll expect the same on the way back.
We do ask to please pay attention to the seatbelt sign
a little indication for you back there.
We will be on our way very shortly, thanks so much for flying Delta today.
Thank you.
When you don't eat ham...
but you're starving.
We're at JFK, I've never been to JFK,
it's weird, it doesn't feel like we're in the city.
We're not doing sh*t for the rest of the day.
Hi can i place an order for room service please?
Thank you
Thanks, hi. Can i place an order?
Cool I'm gonna do two of the taco flights, can I do one shrimp and one chicken
and then, umm
an order of fries?
Uh-huh? Yeah
Yes
Okay, cool. Thank you
So we are at the hotel
Rivington, I don't know don't even look at my face. I look like a monster.
[monster noises]
that's how I feel.
[more monster noises]
but...
this view...
Oh, okay those are the other curtains. Mhmkay let's try that again this view...
It is hot in New York. Okay? It's hot. It's got a balcony, but it's sketchy
But this view up here though, it is pretty
pretty cool.
The Freedom Tower right there
like it!
I like it. We're going back in though cause I'm scared of this balcony
okay I am scared. Lemme in!
Ow, motherf*cker!
Just almost took my toe off.
Close this back up.
Much better.
I told you guys, I'm a vamp.
So yeah, we're just going to chill for the rest of the night. Beebs in the shower I'm gonna jump in after him because I just feel
disgusting. I feel disgusting
okay, I just came from Cuba, the plane you know the plane is gross.
So we just ordered some tacos
and we'll probably just like I said chill out in the room for the rest of the night
I'm sure that I'll see you guys a little bit later tonight because I think we're gonna troll for pizza later, but for now
I ain't doin' sh*t.
Shrimp tacos for me,
chicken tacos for papa,
french fries for us.
Uhhhmm okurr.
It's 10:30pm
I still look like a gremlin
Beebs wants to get pizza,
I look like a f*ckin' gremlin.
[screeches]
You want to go home?
Jeremy: Yes, bad.
I look like a f*cking troll and theres a thousand f*cking people in our lobby.
Jeremy: In suits and sh*t
Nicole: In suits.
I got f*ckin' slides on.
So now we're doing a lap around
I don't know, Lower East-Side or wherever we're at
Because there was just literally a thousand people
in our hotel, I don't know whats happening,
but I don't like it.
I heard this like creepy little troll was on the loose.
Jeremy: All over the place. Got me twice so far.
I haven't seen her yet, but
got my eyes out.
Nicole: Lot's of cool art though
Why is there so many people in our hotel?
The troll is back.
Got some pizza, snuck a buffalo in on there, I turn my back for one second went from 3 to 4 real quick.
I need a shower.
Jeremy: Yeah!
Nicole: And then I'm takin' my ass to sleep.
Alright,
Shower with a view I guess?
Mmhmkay.
Hopefully nobody has any binoculars otherwise they're getting a show!
[&quot;So Fresh, So Clean&quot; By Outkast playing]
So that is it for tonight
I think it's around
12 or so I don't even know what time it is hopefully I had enough footage for today
If not I feel like Friday and Saturday will go up as one, but if you're seeing this on Friday
then I had enough footage, if you're seeing on Saturday, we wrapped it into one, but either way. I'll see you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
