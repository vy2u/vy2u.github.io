Feel more sick than I did yesterday, [and] [I] still got a pack we leave in three hours
first
I'm gonna eat a bagel.
time to pack
Hey
Okay, we are all packed and I just need to make the bed because the cat's like to sleep in the bed
but only when it's made
So almost time to go, I think it's around 1:30
I think we're gonna leave [here] at like 2:15ish. I think [that] I have everything packed and ready to go
and if not
I'll just find another it looks like it's getting ready to monsoon outside
This is especially when I don't like it to rain.
Looks like great flying weather, right?
Love you, babies!
My hair color and rain, they don't go together.
We're going back to the house, cause our flights delayed like three and a half hours, which is making us totally miss our other flight
yay.
So cute, Orange.
I feel like it just smells hot, you know?
It's around five o'clock now
Clearly we're not going to LA today, change of plans
So originally our flight was supposed to leave at 4 o'clock. We had a layover in Denver, our layover was only for 45 minutes.
So cutting it close just in general and then our second flight was supposed to leave at
7:20, and I think we got to LA at like 8:30, 6, you know, with all the time difference and everything. Well our original flight
from Tampa to
Denver got delayed
like three and a half hours so our flight wasn't even going to leave
Tampa until 8:30 and our connecting flight left at
7:20. So I called United, tried to get on another flight
There was no other place leaving from Tampa to LA, we couldn't get on a flight from Denver to LA because they were all booked.
So they tried to get us on an American Airlines flight
We wouldn't be sitting next to each other, there was a layover on that one.
But I was like whatever and I think we got to LA at like 10:00 p.m tonight.
And I was like okay. Go ahead and book it. She's like all right,
I'm gonna go ahead and book it. As she's booking it, I'm looking at my email
She hits me with the email for the confirmation for that American Airlines flight
And it already says that the flight from Tampa to Texas.
So it was Tampa to Texas
Texas to LA
That the flight from Tampa to Texas now on the flight that she's switching me to is already being delayed an hour and a half
so then in turn we would have missed the
Connecting flight from Dallas to LA and maybe have been stuck in the Dallas airport. So I was just like, can switch it to
Tomorrow and in the soonest flight that they could get us on to where we were like sitting next to each other
was leaving at 3:00 p.m tomorrow, so I'm looking at the silver lining and
Feeling like it was the universe helping me out, letting me go get my nails done. So that's why I'm going to do
I'm going in my nails done. I really was gonna rock this to the meet-and-greet, like hey!
but now I can go, get my nails done.
I'm just hoping that we have a little bit better weather than today even though I know it's supposed to be raining at home
All week this week, so I'm pretty sure it'll still be raining tomorrow,  but hopefully, it
wont be raining
as bad as it was today and flights wont be delayed
I already wasn't excited to be flying united because united is likely on my list about what makes a [weak] flight that we could get
That wasn't like a [10-hour] travel day
We have physics to each other but united didn't even hit me with any kind of text email or anything that [the] flight was delayed
I just happened to go on we're on the bridge going into the airport right now
Let me just check that I look at the abacus. I tell if you are doing three [half] hours, I was like
[I'm] [not] better with this thing around I get an email effect of all a carrier pigeon like something
before before
The boat like a witch okay. Let's take it down
[I] just watch the La didn't have to be on the other side of the country [lies]
[why] can't maybe like where Atlanta is and those are just [argument]? [it's] like you know let's go proof
Because I probably would dress honestly if it's under eight hours. I would drive there it was over eight hours on
that motorcycle
Prior on the banal fond [item] hopefully I'm [not] here forever
I'm heading home now. [it] is [seven] o'clock. [I] need to get gas, but we need to go to pulses later
So hopefully I can make home with a gas and if you have to pumping
I'm really hungry
I'm gonna get a green light. Thank you
I don't think I'm conscious and making lots of that and women applies until it all goes
Damage it is a good
Party and we all party it is take a look and we do all parties he just called and you want to just go to
[holes] now so it's almost he didn't hop in the car that defeats like gas
pumping purposes
[Robbie] in the driver Seat
Also, make it up again
[Swap] Espousal to
Hike and a few more drugs. We gotta get back home that one daddy
Couple will be [whipping] up some blackened grouper wash
tossing that lemon
We're Gonna watch a little low deck. It's
11:15 13, so hope you guys come on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
