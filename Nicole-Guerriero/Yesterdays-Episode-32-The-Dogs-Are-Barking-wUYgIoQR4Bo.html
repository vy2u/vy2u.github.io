Still shitty out.
This guy just showed up at the door
Urban Decay Naked Heat
All right anytime now
So we got a new Naked palette.
This is the Heat palette
Two new lip liners
Torch and Alkaline and then three new lippies
Really pretty.
I know some people are over like the warm tone browns, but they'll just never get old to me.
Ever!
This is Fuel
This is Scorched
And this is Heat.
This one has a lot of glitter in it.
Glad that I was home still when this came
Otherwise it would have just been sitting outside in the rain
And these are actually eyeliners
I thought that they were lip liners, but they are glide on eye pencils
So this purplish kind of guy is Alkaline and then this guy is Torch
Alright, we're trying this again
Take two!
First flight's already delayed a little bit
a little bit
Positive thoughts, positive thoughts!
I love you moosh, I love you
It's a race!
You could go up and get some ice
You want me to go get ice?
Yeah
Let me brush my teeth
I got a stinky mouth
Why? You always do
So white
*TV noise in background*
Why does it smell so cinnamon? Waffles?
That's how beebs feels about breakfast
What?
What were you doin?
Snappin my food!
Shall we start?
Sneakers sneakers sneakers sneakers sneakers sneakers
So we should be leaving-
Oh my god it's so bright and white
So i think it's around 11:30
The meet up, like I said, is at 12
I think the Uber is coming to get us, but we're kind of tempted to walk
Because it's right around the corner
Beebs is getting dressed back there in case you were wondering
But I don't know. It's nice out. It's not hot at all.
So we might walk to the meet up
Maybe
Maybe
Alright we're out of here, and I don't know if you guys know, but it's also not just my meet up date
It's me and my papa's 8 year anniversary!
No I don't want to kiss you, I got lipgloss
*laughing*
This is my first time ever wearing sneakers to a meet and greet
I'm not mad at it though
Anna and Nikki are late. Me and Saraya are on time.
We were talking smack a little bit.
We were like &quot;Nikki's late&quot;
And then they were like &quot;she was here 20 minutes ago&quot;
Yeah I was actually the first person here ahead of all of you
I take it back, I take it back
Thank you
I'm on my A game with my timing
You are, you are, you are!
I saw her last time
And I think she's beautiful
And I saw you guys' vlog yesterday
You made squash!
Yes I did!
Beebs is having a meet and greet of his own
Oh he said &quot;give me one more!&quot;
He didn't like the angle
So we just left the meet up
We are going to grab pizza, I think? I don't know
There was hella people
I thought I was being smart wearing my sneakers
No, my feet still hurt like a b*tch
That's 'cause these are new Vans
I made the mistake
now
I need some pizza
Nice
She doesn't like Breaking Bad *laughing*
Alright now we're at a FedEx
We're going to Shanghai in like two weeks.
We got to get extra pictures for our visas right now
Mug shots done
Now we're walking back to the hotel room
My f*cking feet hurt
Danny Perez
Me and beebs thank you for these
It says Nicole, that's so sweet
We leave in the morning, so super quick trip
I didn't get a vlog up today, I know
But I just wanted to combine today and yesterday's
Because I didn't do sh*t yesterday except travel here
So something that was so crazy when we checked in
This hotel that we're staying at, which is the Redbury
On Vine, I think?
Capitol Records is right there, across the street
I'm sorry it's so loud, but there's a lot going on
Hello
This is the first hotel I ever stayed in the very first time I came to L.A.
And in this exact same room
*Twilight Zone music*
I just thought that was like so weird, like what are the chances that I'm the same exact room
And I haven't stayed in this hotel since that very first time
I don't know, I just find that peculiar.
I also can't tell you how good it feels
to have my hair in a bun
So we just walked over to the W because it's like real close to us to have a drink
with the owners of Eyelure
I was like, you have fun
My feet can't take it
5 hour meet up?
Toes are hurtin, toes are hurtin
So I'm just gonna take my makeup off
hang out, eat those Sprinkle cupcakes
You guys were so sweet and amazing
Again it was just so amazing to meet you guys
I love squeezing you and hugging you
and nothing is better to me than that
I'm gonna go take my makeup off, lay in bed
I guess I need some of those cupcakes, and then we are out of here bright and early
our flight leaves at 6:00
A.M.
I don't wanna get up
The dogs are barkin'
*woof woof*
I think it's so sweet when you guys take time to like write me a note
I will always read these
I don't read the notes or open them until I get home and I can actually read them in the comfort of my own home
I have a special place that I keep them so
and I just want to say thank you if you've ever written me a note
I keep it forever handwritten notes are one of the sweetest things
Which you can give someone I think and someone got me a little cat mom mug
And I'm not mad at you if you bring me sweet treats. Okay, even though I've gained ten pounds
I don't care life's too short not to eat a piece of cake not to eat a doughnut, okay?
So I'mma live
I feel like I dance after something is really delicious
you know?
I just wanted to say thank you again
for all these notes
for all the gifts for all the hugs for all the tears for all the smiles you guys just mean so much to me and
I hope you know it, so I'm just packing up all my stuff. I'm basically packed
we were here for I feel like 24 hours our flight leaves at 6:00 in the morning, so we gotta leave here around 4-ish
Maybe a little earlier, I don't think we leave exactly at 6:00, maybe 6:30. I don't know I should probably check that
So beebs is on his way back now
I'm just going to lay in the bed and try to get some sleep, so I will see you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
