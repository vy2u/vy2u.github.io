You can see that. It's still like Reddish pinkish in some areas, and then some areas. It's like
Super lights, I'm probably going to end up dying it tonight or tomorrow
I'm hoping that I can dye it tonight
Maybe late night like after we go home from Jeremy's Monto because I need to pack tomorrow
So this is the new SmaShbox foundation if you missed my unboxing when I was talking about it
It comes with a foundation side, and then it caalso comes with a soft contour side
I'll show you as well, so this is the contour side, and this is the foundation side, I'm going to wear it in the color
2.2 today
Let's see what this is like
Good
Wearing my wife. I don't know why on camera. It's these lights like these lights make me look
Orange it does a recorder person, so the foundation is really nice. I really like the finish of it like a satiny
It's not like super mad or super dewy looking like natural it has really good coverage
Sorry that these lights over here suck. I really like the coverage and the feel of it
On the face I'm not sure the finish, but like I said the finish kind of looks natural
there's a little bit of shine to the skin but not a lot, so
Check back in later
Skin is acting right?
Don't drink yourself. You have like a 3000 hour flight coming up, so has anybody seen the ice cream Museum
I just want to say that they copied me and my pink phone
These are all over the ice cream Museum. I had it first I
Add it first
So I told you guys were going to Jeremy's mom's house tonight for dinner
So you just want to get us some quick. Just like a little starving. I learned that an eight count them
No twelve try to save room for dinner tonight
So things to do when we come back from Shanghai
Start working on this room, and I still need to get the new fan put up which is right there. It needs to be there
We are on our way to
Karis Mom
Like something so delicious Accio 81 nutshell. What would I say?

Clearly that self tanner is hanging on for dear life. We're going to get rid of this weird little color. I hope
You know I don't mind it as much as the other color it was
the face to neck situation in a little area
I'm going to use box tag because we're in a time crunch situation
Don't come from me. Okay. It's my head. It's my hair, okay
Let me live Rebecca if you're watching I'm sorry, but I've done this to you plenty of times before
So this is what I'm using and I'm using it in medium brown. I'm probably also going to die some hair extensions
Like these guys here

Then see how dark or whatever color my hair comes out because I may have hair extensions that will already match my hair color
But if I don't we have these on deck to die

I cannot go back to Target, but he needs like wife beaters or something
Boxers, I don't know what he needs he knew something clearly
