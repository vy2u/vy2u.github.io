back to winter wonder week we have
arrived we have stumbled upon day number
three welcome so for day three today I'm
flying in heaven I'm high up in the sky
that backdrop is so blue I feel like I'm
in the sky right now and I haven't even
had breakfast yet woohoo so for day
three of winter Wonder week I wanted to
compare my holy grill foundation to a
brand new drugstore foundation this hood
a beautyful filter foundation as you
know it did a video on it is my holy
grail foundation it gives me full
coverage dreams it gives me everything
that my makeup addict soul needs and
wants and desires this I don't know what
it does this is the maybelline superstay
24 hour full coverage foundation and
I've heard really good things about it
so I was at why not compare a high-end
really full coverage long lasting
foundation with a low-end really long
for my foundation so I'm gonna be
testing it on my face to see how it
applies to see how it blends just see
how it works into the skin and then
we're gonna go over top with bronzer
highlighter and all that good stuff to
see how it holds up after a big beating
of makeup so if you're excited I'm
excited I'm always excited it's day
three and let's go
all right so here we have my bear face
and this is what it looks like today the
redness is down because it's cold in my
room and when it's cold in the room I
don't get red so this is what it looks
like and I was thinking maybe I can do a
skin care routine slash my skincare
secrets in winter wonder week as well so
if you want to see that let me know down
below let me know so the first product
I'm gonna go in with I'm gonna treat
both foundations like they are the same
so I'm gonna prime the same way I'm
gonna treat my skin the same way leading
up to the foundation application so the
first product I'm gonna go in with is
you're getting sick and tired of me
using this Hopf this is amazing
cosmetics illuminate primary highlighter
in glow this stuff is just I love this I
can't get enough of it it's so nice so
I'm just gonna work this into my skin
with a brush on both sides treated
equally baby alright so I'll be starting
off with the hood a beautiful filter
foundation because I have uses on camera
before and we all know what it does for
me and what to expect from it so it's
easier to just get that on and then
compare how the Maybelline does in
comparison okay
so here we go what a beauty as you can
see it's a full coverage dream it just
applies so rich so intense and it covers
up anything it covers up your past it
covers up the future it covers up the
present and my favorite thing about it
is that as you're doing it your skin
still looks like skin but photoshopped
and perfect and flawless this one is a
hard one to beat because ever since I
got this I haven't used a different
foundation this has been on my face ever
since
alright so that is hood a beautiful
filter foundation on the left side of my
face like you almost don't need any
additional concealer this is a must-have
in your kit trust me now let's move on
to the Maybelline 24-hour super stay
foundation and online it says experience
the superpower of makeup the high
pigment foundation combats the clock for
transforming 24-hour wear alright so
this is what it looks like it comes with
a pump and I am in the color 110
porcelain picking that up on my sponge
and here will you go oh baby oh i see
crunch oh my god
damn
alright this Maybelline foundation
obviously is not here to play this is
full coverage so as I'm applying it to
my forehead let me give you my initial
thoughts it feels and applies a little
drier than the hood a beautiful filter
it applies a little bit less smooth I
have to work it in a tiny bit more I
think both sides have about the same
coverage of the on the hood aside it
just looks a little bit more natural so
if you're looking for full coverage like
all the way but still natural
I think hood a beauty if you're looking
for full coverage and a little bit more
plasticy it's Maybelline when I look at
my skin really up close I see that well
of course hood a beauty has dried in a
little bit so far but Maybelline almost
looks identical and that hasn't dried in
yet so that tells me that the maybelline
superstay is a little bit drier than the
faux filter by hooda and I have dry skin
so that wears me a tiny bit but it's
nothing like fancy beauty Fenty beauty
made me look like a desert other than
that I definitely see that it minimized
the appearance of pores it's not
exaggerating any fine lines it's just
looking like a veil of beautifulness
on both sides so now let's blend in
concealer over top to see if it blends
nicely if it just works together nicely
and let's see how it does on both sides
are gonna be using the NARS soft matte
complete conceal concealer and I am
light - vanilla see and not every
concealer blends with every foundation
out there it truly is a test for some
concealers to blend in nicely with the
foundation underneath but I don't know
how it will do on the maybelline side I
will say after doing that natural makeup
challenge it feels so good to take it on
as you can see that blended in perfectly
and traceless lee now let's do the
maybelline side so far it's going
perfectly I almost feel like I'm using
the same foundation although again the
Maybelline one is a little bit more dry
but other than that it feels like I'm
using the same foundation all over my
face concealer is blending in traceless
lis concealer is going perfectly and if
I didn't tell you that I'm wearing two
foundations at once right now you
wouldn't be able to tell now we're going
to bake my under-eye using the fit me
loose powder by Maybelline this is my
favorite powder to bake with and I know
that the Hooda side goes really well
with it and it's a Maybelline product
Maybelline the Maybelline it probably
goes really well too
stunning goes really well and now use
them some Cody airspun and a damp sponge
I press the powder in all over my face
for the longest lasting base of life
yeah this condition is handling the
powder really really well
it's not shifting it's not moving around
it's taking the powder and working it
the only thing I'm noticing now that I'm
looking in the monitor is that the
Maybelline side is eyeing a little bit
darker than the hood of Beauty side so
that tells me that the maybelline side
has oxidized a little teensy bit much
more than the hooda Beauty side but
there's nothing a little bit of bronzer
can't fix all right now I'm gonna do my
eye makeup and my brows and I'll be back
to see if bronzer applies beautifully
over top of this as well and blush and
highlighter and everything so I'll be
right back here we go in a 1 in a 2 in a
3 right so brows and eyes are applied
and as you can see it did oxidize even
though I powdered a little bit more so
now we can see that this side is a
little bit darker than this side
although this side did oxidize as well
this basically always happens to me and
what I do to fix it is apply bronzer to
monic using this right here this is a
Mac next to nothing powder and medium
dark and I use this to sort of bronze up
my face and sort of tie everything
together
and the bronzer is applying seamlessly
is going on like buttah the Maybelline
is standing strong and not letting it
mess around with this is really really
good so far for the hood of beauty side
I mean um if you watch any of my videos
you know that it applies really nicely
over it because I wear this foundation
in pretty much every video and now to
fix this mess up wrongs baby
brawl then I contour and I apply my
contour in soft circular motions and
sometimes if you are wearing the wrong
base for example the RCM a cream-colored
base that for me when I go in with a
swirling motion like this and apply my
contour like that
it totally moves it starts ruining
everything it starts totally messing it
up and leaving holes and marks and
streaks and with this it is just gliding
over top contouring the good stuff and
leaving the good stuff in place oh now
comes another really really important
one nose contouring if I'm not wearing
the right base underneath and I do my
nose contour you will see streaks
redness marks I'll see you messed up
nose and lately I've been really trying
my nose contour to like really step it
up because the hood of beauty foundation
is the only one so far that doesn't
budge as soon as I go in with this brush
on my nose so let's see if the
Maybelline side does the same burrs they
go underneath a little bit of shadow
nothing to like mess up here but this is
where we start the bridge the bridge
sides sides put a Beauty side traces
perfect I can contour with it Maybelline
side traceless beautiful I can counter
with it another tricky step blush this
causes for a lot of friction on the skin
and you need a tough hard core base that
will sit it through and look flawless in
the end so I'm gonna go in with this
blush right here it's a nice glowy one
I'm picking some
on my brush tap tap and here we go so
I'm applying it in nice circular
swirling motions to get that warmth on
my cheek and something very very good I
don't know if it's because Christmas was
yesterday but I'm having such a good
makeup date okay so now I'm going to
carve out underneath my cheek to define
the contour a little bit more I'm so
sorry British people I will never do
that again
to test of all tests a wet highlighter
on top of powdered skin is probably the
biggest test you can give any foundation
out there because with most what
highlighters on top of a powdered skin
it's gonna move the base it's gonna
create redness it's gonna it's gonna
make things look really really messy so
today I'm going in with the first Sally
jelly bean I'm gonna dip my finger into
the for Sally jelly bean tap it on the
skin pray to God that it doesn't move
around the base too much and then set it
with a reflective eyeshadow into the
skin and then setting with a powder oh
hello
alright and to tie the look together I
want to keep everything in the very gold
bronzy tones as you can see by
everything on my face right now so I'm
gonna go in with this smashbox always on
liquid lipstick in the colour carrot
stick
and of course I'm setting spray alright
guys so what is our end conclusion when
I look at both foundations I think
they're both very very similar they both
guarantee for amazing full high coverage
plastic fantastic nests they both work
well on my dry combination skin although
with one side note that the Maybelline
is a smidgen more dry so if you're a
little bit on the oily or side I think
the Maybelline is more fit for you also
color range they are super super close
angel food and 110 porcelain are almost
a dead-on match the only side note I
have for the Maybelline one is that it
oxidizes a tiny bit more but there's
nothing a little bit of bronzer can't
fix so quality wise and application wise
and everything you put overtop wise they
are almost identical
now there is one major difference
between the two and that is pricing hood
a beautiful filter retails for $40
that's a hefty price for a foundation
this right here $11.99 that is a huge
difference for two foundations that are
basically almost the same and if you ask
me I might even go as far as saying that
I think these two are each other's
perfect dupes
so definitely let me know what you think
did you see a major change on camera did

up about definitely let me know in the
