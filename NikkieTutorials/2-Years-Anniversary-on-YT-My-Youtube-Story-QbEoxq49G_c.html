everyone so today is a really special
day in my life basically um
today is June 23rd 2010 or 2010 how I
should say and it's my YouTube second
birthday two years ago around this time
because I most of the time take my
videos at 2 o'clock um I was here with
my with my ugly brown hair my fat face
and I sit here and I get my first
tutorial and I was so insecure and I
didn't know how to act in front of the
camera um I didn't know how to talk
English properly um two years ago wow
I'm gonna so today I'm going to tell you
how the last two years were for me what
you guys needed to me what is coming up
um what my plans are in the future so I
hope you stick with me and watch this
video so two years ago on June 23 2008 I
started getting my mom's camera I'm
gonna take it I sneaked my mom's camera
into my room this is the camera I always
fill my tutorials with I always did it
with this baby and um I didn't have a
good setup I didn't have good lighting I
opened my window so everyone could hear
it um basically my first video sucked as
hell and then I remembered that I posted
it on YouTube and I had like zero views
0 comments zero ratings my channel was
viewed zero times and I was like half
why am I even doing this I mean I suck
at make up and people were like me
anyways I'm this fat girl from
the nail ends with a sucky accent and
everyone will like me
so then something in my head told me
that night like we need action we need
to do something about it because uh so I
contacted makeup geek TV Marlena and um
I told her you see I'm 14 years old and
you may think I'm a crazy person that's
doing make tutorials already on 14 years
old
um of age but can you help me I was like
how do you set up your videos how do you
do your lighting how do you how do you
come up with ideas and stuff and to be
honest I never thought Marlena would
respond to me but like two hours later I
got a response from Marlena
and she told me everything Marlena was
the person who told me how to set up my
videos how to come up with ideas how to
put on my camera on the right settings
she basically what I am today
Marlena is 50% of that she has 50% she
has I'm 50% of this all some ralina I
really want to thank you I'm gonna cry
because I never thought that you would
help me but you stick through with me
like you were here from day one till two
years later right now um I always wanted
to makeup geek TV for him that is where
I really grow grown where I've really
grown um on the makeup geek forum I
showed looks and people were so not nice
and he's told me what it could do better
and that would improve my videos so much
more some really not I want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart for helping
me for sticking through with me for
always being there for me you are a
great great friend and I love you in the
middle already a kitchen minute so I
remember my first video where I was like
hey you guys so my verse
I didn't say first I said first okay
that's like the biggest stupid blooper
I've done to my entire YouTube career
I didn't say first I said first I
remember that I wore this because I
penisy i-81 um she wore always like
these happens that like flick her hair
back and penisy havoc in that time was
my big favorite I know she was like the
biggest and I think she's right now too
but um or is it Michelle I don't know
but I was like well if it's working for
her that it should work for me so I've
got this super figure you know I had a
little it's all crazy sticky um so I had
that on in my first video I was like why
did you even do that why and in your
first comment is so weird / cool / oh my
god at the same time um you're like woah
someone is actually watching this
someone is actually interested and
seeing your face which was so freaking
weird basically I did that one year long
and in that year I got more and more
views a couple of more subscribers um so
after a year if I can remember correctly
I had three thousand subscribers three
thousand so it took me a year to get
three thousand subscribers and that was
insane to me like seriously if you would
have three thousand people in my room
which doesn't even fit but you know what
I mean that's insane they're all
watching you and then from this year
from 2009 to 2010 um things got pretty
pretty hectic huh let me tell you that
um I film videos I I most of the time
filmed them on Saturday around 2 o'clock
I know what finish around 3:30 and I
would edit and I
we'll put them up around 6 o'clock that
was my normal routine and um I did that
every week and every week I got a new
video and views and maximum was like
3000 views and then things started going
crazy I got more and more subscribers I
got more and more views I got more and
more Commons ratings and all of a sudden
I was getting bigger and bigger on
YouTube and uh then I reached 10,000
subscribers and I really remember that
day because it was crazy as hell my
family didn't know I was doing this
videos and then the day that I had
10,000 subscribers me and my family were
eating and then my brother was like so
I'm gonna now YouTube videos musical and
I was like what how do you know after
like a year my family found out about my
videos and um it was weird as hell
because it was awkward you know you're
talking English my family is Dutch no
one speaks English properly in my family
um so it was kind of awkward for them to
talk to see me talk English and to be
such another different person and and
just be Nikki but a ten times better
Nikki when I was a little child I
actually went to a therapist and she
helped me get more sick and more secure
so not insecure but secure or
self-confident or confident actually so
I was really really insecure when I was
younger and I was back then soon when I
first started making videos so when my
video so when my family knew about my
videos it was so weird but so cool at
the same time then actually around half
a year ago or like three or four months
ago
um the Dutch news
papers and TV shows found out about me
um actually because of my brother
because my brother emailed the heck out
of his himself um he emailed the
newspaper is like yo this is my sister
check her out
um so then I got in all dutch newspapers
basically and then TV shows started
calling like when you on our show we
want you we want to interview you we
want you to do makeup for our show and
then is and that is the time when things
were getting crazy right now after two
years I am at 33,000 subscribers that
means in one year I got thirty thousand
subscribers which is insane that is all
because of YouTube a channel is still
growing my views are still growing I am
still growing on it's insane it's it's
so hard for me to believe that this
insecure girl from the nail ends at 14
years old can get so many subscribers
and get so many compliments and it has
done so much for my confidence that I
feel a really different person right now
I'm not that girl anymore from two years
ago I have changed I sometimes I get
hums like um you're enough the Nicki we
used to know anymore um no I changed
I've become a confident girl who loves
people who love their subscribers would
do anything for them and is really happy
in life a fritter future I really want
to talk about the future of course I'm
gonna keep making videos um I probably
won't do it until I'm 30 or something
because that would be 15 years that
would be the longest
the revised actually going to school in
Amsterdam I'm going to be Academy and I
will go there for a makeup and hair
so um probably I will get better than I
am right now um Wow Wow that's all I can
say Wow
I want to thank everyone in my life for
helping me on YouTube I want to thank
everyone for watching subscribing
waiting counting hating um spamming I
don't know I want to thank you all um
big shout outs go to make a P TV Marlena
mischievious for helping me with our
collab and being such a great person

always being one of my best friends um I
