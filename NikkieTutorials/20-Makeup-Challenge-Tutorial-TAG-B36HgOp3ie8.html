$20 makeup challenge I've ever changed
it a bit
for me it's the 20 euros makeup
challenge because I live in an Ellen's I
got tagged by Zhang Han to us a day like
10 years ago and I'm finally coming
around to doing this video so last week
I went to the drugstore and I've got
some great products from Catrice and
essence L'Oreal and stuff is like as
expensive as MEK in here that's insane
so I put on my fancy glittering blouse
and some curls in the hair because if
you can't flog the makeup you flaunt
something else let's go right ahead and
get started with this 20 euros makeup
challenge
okay so what I'm starting off with today
is the essence I browse a designer
pencil and this is number four blonde
and I'm just going to define my tail and
this pencil I think it's quite good but
the problem is that Dutch drugstores
really aren't like ligh blonde light
skinned people friendly I don't know
it's just
we Dutch people we are known for blonde
hair basically in my opinion and like
seriously every eyebrow pencil in the
drugstores is dark and the texture of
this it's kind of waxy so your hair
stick together that's just a little bit
of a downer now you can really see that
this pencil makes your hairs stick
together it's really clumpy and waxy I'm
slightly and slowly going to feather
some color to the front because I'm
basically bald there and then what's
really nifty about this pencil is the
comb so I'm just going to distribute
some of the color in my tail to the
front that way your brows wouldn't look
as harsh if you just pencil the front in
I'm going to take this Catrice cover
stick concealer in number of their side
number ten and also phone Catrice I got
this really nifty brush it's a blending
side and a slanted eyeliner side and I'm
going to use the slanted eyeliner side
to define my brows
you
so for eyes I will be using this
gorgeous I mean I love this palette this
Catrice absolute eye color palette and
the name of this is number 30 oh my god
I want that I love drugstore names but
first I'm going to use the Catrice skin
finish contact powder in number 10
transparent because let me tell you
getting an eyeshadow primer in the
drugstores in the Netherlands is near
impossible what I'm going to do is take
my powder puff and I always have this
with me and I'm just going to go in the
powder and sort of set my eye space area
there for my one and only brush I will
be using their brush again with the
slanted eyeliner side and the blending
side and the first color we'll be using
is that light shimmery gold color I'm
going to dampen my finger with a makeup
wipe then go into the eye shadow and
then just place it on to your lid and
this color is gorgeous
I really like that now going to take
this stunning bronze shimmery color and
with the blending side of that brush I
am just going to create a really fun
bronze shimmery crease and I'm going to
go all the way in not to blend it you're
just going to make some circular motions
at the edges of the crease and slightly
go up and then also windshield wiper
motions help as well sort of those I'm
going to take a little bit more and also
go into my outer third and blend it on
to the lid I'm going to go back into my
eyebrow pencil and bring some definition
to my lower lash line going over that
with the bronze again and I'm now using
the slanted eyeliner side of the brush
and then work your way in and then also
go a little bit down for some smoke
I'm not going to mix the bronze into
black glittery color together and darken
the outer corners with this for the
inner corner I'm taking a damp q-tip and
I'm going to go into that light gold
color and apply it as an inner corner
highlight that looks like a million
bucks
I'm not going to wet this lend to the
eyeliner side of my brush and go into
the sparkly black and use it as an
eyeliner
for mascara I hate to break it down to
you but I have to cheat on this step
originally for this video I bought the
Catrice a volume plus waterproof mascara
I applied this mascara and like after 5
minutes my eye started tearing watering
stinging it just didn't feel right and I
haven't had time to go back to you the
mall yet to get a new mascara so let's
just pretend that I'm using this Catrice
mascara but in real life I will be using
the makeup studio waterproof 3d extra
black mascara this is my go-to mascara
my favorite mascara I always use it so
this is the only step I sort of have to
cheat on because my eyes will kill me if
I apply this right now so I'm so sorry
but I'm going to apply my own mascara
for now
I wanted to buy a foundation but one
they were all too dark
um and I didn't have enough money to buy
like a lighter foundation with it and
not that they really sold that either so
my only option was to go for concealer
and because I didn't have a lot of
budget I just chose to reuse my creased
cover stick concealer in number 10 warm
beige now it's quite a a thick concealer
um so this is going to feel like a mask
for me but it's okay anything for a
video so I'm just going to conceal under
my eyes and some redness and some
pimples basically my entire face and
then I'm just going to blend it out with
my fingers and let's see what it does
I do not recommend this to anyone at
home because this will clog your pores
in ten minutes
so the war paint is on and now I'm going
to blend it out with my fingers I'm not
going to set this entire greased Ness
with my core treats paste powder and I'm
just going to use my powder puffs so
this is going to go on pigmented as hell
and I'm just going to go under my eyes
and set that oh by the way leave your
cheeks alone for now for cheeks I'm
actually going to use a lipstick this is
Catrice ultimate color lipstick at
number 130 frozen rose and I'm just
going to put some on my hand and Pat
that on the apples of my cheeks I do
really really miss my contour powder
right now because I always counter the
crap out of my face
formulas I'm going to use the same
lipstick that I use as a blush so again
that is the Catrice ultimate color 1:30
lipstick in frozen rose
and that guy's completes my $20 slash
for me euros makeup challenge I love
doing this I thought it was so fun to
kind of go out of my comfort zone of
going to Mac or Inglot or Chanel or I
don't know what and just goes through
drugstore products and finally see that
drugstores also have some hidden jewels
in there
all-in-all I am super happy that I
finally did this challenge I hope you
