December 2011 that means in a couple of
hours it's going to be 2012 or 2012 and
I wanted to close this year with my last
video for 2011 2011 with my highlights
of the year my favorite products of the
year let's just go right ahead and I'm
gonna show you my all-time favorite
products of 2011 okay so the first thing
I really wanted to talk about is my
favorite conditioner for my lips or for
any really dry patches on my face this
is Elizabeth Arden eight hour cream I
have it in a pot like this but they
regular right I have it in a pot like
this but they regularly come in
something like that Elizabeth Arden
eight hour cream is just a really really
thick moisturizer and cream it's so good
for your lips like I always get
questions on videos like how do you keep
your lips so soft and not try after all
those products this is the magic that
does it then another really good
conditioner for your skin which is
actually a cream is by Dermalogica I
must say that I'm really really
impressed with all of their products
their cleansing stuff is really good
their moisturizing stuff is really good
their masks are good their scrubs are
good I'm really a fan of Dermalogica and
the ones that I'm an ultimate fan of
this year are the skin hydrating booster
this is sort of like a serum that you
put before it your moisturizer and if
you have really dry skin this is perfect
I have combination skin and in winter it
turns into a dry desert you can see the
cameras walk all over me so this is sort
of a really really hydrating booster
serum for your skin to kind of prep it
for analyzer and to really lock that
moisture in and then my favorite
moisturizer is the intensive moisture
balance from Dermalogica this is for
combination to dry skin or really dry
skin this is perfect it moisturizes the
like crazy it's nice and moisturizing
now my mom sells
got in our webshop I'm just putting it
out there and it is international so go
ahead and check head school Smith skies
dot NL out if we got to make up you of
course all know that I'm going to talk
about my favorite Mecca a shadow or one
of my favorites quark and quark I've
been using it in pretty much every video
that I did cork is like a mid-tone cool
warm Brown it's the perfect light brown
for really fair skin tones ladies like
me quark is just one of those wonders
the one of those magical creatures it is
a great blending car in the crease if
you're one a really natural look it's
beautiful for just a crease alone a
little bit on the lower lid then next is
the MEC Paint Pot in soft ochre you know
that I love this one because this is a
base and what it a shadow base does is
it keeps your eyeshadow on the entire
day until you wash it off the thing is
this is really weird
I used to use painterly Paint Pot from
Mac but that did crease on me which is
really weird and then I got the soft
ochre Paint Pot and that did increase on
me but I really really like to stop
darker Paint Pot it is a great color if
you're a dark-skinned lady you know that
if you put this on and you put an
eyeshadow on top it's really gonna pop
because this is lighter than your skin
tone it's a must-have
then another Mac product is this
blending brush this is the Mac 224 I own
three of these because this is my
ultimate favorite makeup brush this is
perfect for blending it blends
everything out perfectly for in the
crease you just do this and you're done
it just blends it right away if you want
this to be a little bit more smokey done
this is the ultimate big blending brush
that will blend anything out in seconds
metaphore favorite mascara this is my
makeup studio and if you watch my videos
regular here we go again
reg levels are really you know that I
always talk about the mascara from
makeup studio their mascaras are
beautiful they have two which are the
maximum volume and a water-resistant
volume and the what
resistent volume is beautiful because it
it's not what a proof of what a
resistance so if you cry it still is
going to run but it's a little bit
stronger than a normal mascara and this
one is perfect but just it holds my curl
up and I have the worst lashes ever this
is also available in my mom's web shop
I've only got this like a couple of
weeks ago and since I got it I've been
obsessed with it this is the Moroccan
oil oil this is amazing like if you have
really dry ends or just really dry hair
you just take one little teeny squirt of
this and you put it all through your
ends and then work your way up and not
so much on the scalp because then it
will look greasy but it gives your hair
this amazing shine it gives your hair
this really good feel to it so soft and
so far fine it's so fun you know it's
fine like oh god it just conditions your
hair like crazy and it's just amazing
and I love it and if you have dry hair
you want to give it that boost and get
this this is available at HQ hair calm I
believe the Chi hair curling irons
these are the bomb.com org dot NL dot
yeah yeah I'm gonna do an in-depth
review on this very soon but just to
give you a heads up these curling irons
are the bomb so that is probably
everything product wise that were
insanely good in 2011 in 2011 I became a
full working professional makeup artist
and hair artist I'm actually in an
agency for makeup and hair artist and
it's called colorful agency and with
that agency I did the makeup and hair in
the team for Hollins NYX top model which
was insanely cool it was so much fun I'm
actually working every week which is
pretty that's my dream so my dream
actually came true and I'm so thankful
because without YouTube I would never
have been there also in the beginning of
this year I went to New York and that
was just such a big experience I've
never been to the States before and
17 years old so I went to the states at
my 17th and that was insane
Times Square I met in New York was the
best experience of my life all the
people I met there all the people wanted
to take pictures with me um everyone
just screamed Nicki it was just so weird
and I feel until today I can't believe
that I actually am where I am right now
I've been to the States I'm in an agency
right now I hit over 140,000 subscribers
which is so much and I'm I'm nominated
for Twitter Person of the Year and my
life is so crazy and I'm absolutely
loving it to every single second and I'm
so thankful because without you this
would have never happened to me never
and I'm so thankful and I'm just really
thankful so I want to say thank you guys
so much that brings us to the end of
this video again thank you so much
I want to wish you a great amazing Happy
New Year 2012 is going to be amazing for
all of us I just feel it and thank you
