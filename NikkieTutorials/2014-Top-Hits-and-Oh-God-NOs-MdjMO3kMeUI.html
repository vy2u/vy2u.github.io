2014 hits and God knows what were my
favorite products of 2014 and what
happened in 2014 plus a compilation of
all my Oh God knows you're going to be
in for a treat with this one so how I'm
going to do this is I basically picked
all the products that I loved using most
in this year in 2014 if I would have to
pick makeup that I loved in 2014 and
could never use again like it's the only
product that I could ever use for the
rest of my life these will be it meaning
they're like my top top favorite so that
is sort of how I went around this one so
everyone has been posting these videos
and they're hella long so let's get to
it
okay so the first one is by Mac this is
the prep and prime natural radiance in
radiant yellow this is one of the best
primers you could ever wish for because
it transforms somewhat dull dry skin
into a nice moisturized clean canvas
it's great for if you have somewhat of a
more matte and heavy foundations because
they will just illuminate through and it
will able just able make everything that
you put on top look good basically then
of course the Becca shimmering skin
perfectors I've been all over these this
year the first one I really like is opal
and pearl and pearl is more so for my
fair skin tone people and this for my
somewhat darker I'm not gonna live used
as many times on myself also just
because I don't give a to makeup
does not have any rolls whenever I want
to go for that really glowy look this is
what I opted for because it just it
gives you a really nice glowy look my
absolute favorite foundations this year
were by far like by far the L'Oreal True
Match ah such a good foundation it's
drug source so it's cheap it covers it
looks natural it still looks like skin
you can use a little bit to just hai
some flaws but you can use a of it
to make you look extra extra flawless
and I just love this one this is one of
my daily foundations that wherever I
want to go I pop this on my face and I
look good I've also been loving the
benefit hello flawless foundation in I'm
pure for sure now what's even better is
these two combined
I feel like the Loreal is great for
coverage and then the hello flawless
gives this really healthy flawless
finish to the face it's I don't know why
but together these are like golden I was
on both on the Mon don't get me wrong
but I feel like together these are like
the golden pear
for concealer I don't even want to talk
about it it's Pro Longwear by Mac this
is my most used concealer of life and
this is probably my fifth model of it
not this year though maybe for this year
it's like my third this is awesome it's
one of the best concealers ever it just
hides all the flaws it stays on like a
mother hmm it's great I love it there
for eyebrows there hasn't been anything
better than an Associate Beverly Hills
in my opinion that woman has changed the
eyebrow world the eyebrow game
everyone's eye row game became strong
when Anastasia came along the thought of
that it's that my two favorite products
by Anastasia Beverly Hills of course the
dipbrow is awesome and I still have to
do a video on it I'm so sorry but my two
favorite products by Anastasia Beverly
Hills for the brows are the brow is this
is ash blonde I don't know if they
renamed it to taupe or it's still ash
blonde now I don't know I'm just on the
color - blonde brow is is the like if
you have eyebrows you need this in your
life what I love to do with brow Wiz is
line my eyebrows and then fill in with
the dip brow and that's how I do my
eyebrows but you can also use this to
fill it it's just so precise and sharp
and thin it it's so precise - short thin
and thing it's the best and I will swear
my life on this one it's the best
eyebrow pencil you will ever run into
then my other favorite product for the
brows a bite on the size of Beverly
Hills is the clear brow gel now I have
tried a lot of clear brow gels none of
them are so hardcore like this one you
could stand in a in a tornado and your
hairs will be in place this is hardcore
eyebrow gel and I love it then also for
the eyebrows I have been obsessed
like literally obsessing I keep thinking
about it throughout the day I'm like oh
I can't wait to put it on my face again
the Tarte colored clay tinted brow gel
is literally one of the best coloring
eyebrow gels
of the entire industry why it has the
most precise teeny tiny brush ever I
mean look at how small that is which
makes it perfect like perfect for
defining like individual hairs in your
brows how I use this is ISIL in my brows
with the brow Wiz and the dipper out by
Anasazi app then the front of my brow is
because I don't have a lot of hairs
they're kind of sparse then it looks
like I have an hombre brow but I don't
always necessarily want to go for an
hombre brow so I pop the color clay
tinted brow gel by Tarte on the front of
my brows and it just colors it in in
such a natural full way that it looks
like I have very natural filled in
eyebrows this is the best color clay
tinted brow gel ever and everyone needs
it if you have the same problems as I do
skipping on to powder face powder I have
too if you want to go for a clearer
powder that does exactly what it should
do it makes your face matte and makes
you look good the Mac invisible set
powder is great I use this for all my
photo shoots because it's invisible so I
can just do whatever I want and it will
look good on my models
now the other cutter that I really like
and I've talked about this in my
December hits in the god knows is the
makeup studio extra fine setting powder
number one why because this is light
enough for me to do the cooking method
and the cooking method I will show you
in the tutorial that goes up on Monday
so beware to check that out but these
two powders have been absolutely great
to me and especially the makeup studio
one has me as maja pouting faster gasps
I feel like Meghan Trainor in the third
ago so onto blushes i i love blush there
are two blushes that i gravitated
towards the most this year the first
half of this blushing year was dedicated
to you dainty by mac this is a
mineralized blush this it just may
she looks so healthy and radiant and
gorgeous like it's one of those blushes
that suits every eye look every lip look
it just goes with everything
and it has a little faint shimmer in it
that makes you look like you're glowing
from within and it's just one of those
blushes that work then the other half of
2014 has been all about my Tarte
celebrated blush this also again is a
more neutral peachy pinky color and
again this is one of those blushes that
you don't have to think about you just
pop it on and it goes with everything
goes with every eye look every lip look
every every hair hairdo
I don't normally you know change out my
blush for my hairdo petunia what I'm
saying
my favorite highlighters of 2014 are by
far by Becca I ordered one which was
moonstone and I immediately fell in love
with moonstone because it's oh god this
will make you look like an illuminating
God so I love moon so for myself because
I'm really fair and this just blends
right in and makes you look really
healthy and glowy for fair skin tones
now if I have a tan or for my darker
models I gravitate towards opal opal
also is goddamn amazing this will also
make you look like a frickin God like a
glowing God and it's also great from the
lid it's great for inner corner
highlights it's the Becca shimmering
skin perfectors are very very very worth
the hype on if they're if I had to pick
one product that was super hyped this
year 2014 last year it are the Becca
shimmering skin perfectors and they're
so so so worth the hype of course this
shouldn't come as a surprise but my
favorite product to contour with this
year has been my Illamasqua eyeshadow in
heroine it has definitely won over the
NYX blush in taupe for me I lost this
one for a little while and I had to go
back to my NYX blush in taupe and I'm
going to say it this one's better it
just it makes your cheekbones look
sculpted and nice and it's a little bit
on the gray ashy tone which is great
because then your cheeks actually look
like they have a shadow it's a great
great eye shadow
I love this if you are someone like my
skin tone you need this to contour with
four eyeshadows it's impossible for me
to pick just one favorite eyeshadow of
the entire maybe like let alone say like
three or four I cannot I do have some
random favorites first of all the UH
necessity of Beverly Hills single
eyeshadows I am so glad that on Nastasia
didn't just think about the brows only
and thought of the eye she's coming up
with lip products now I can't wait for a
nostalgic to take over the makeup world
but these single eyeshadows are that
freakin tastic they are super duper
pigmented they are so nice to blend so
easy to work with and I don't have like
specific favorites but all the
eyeshadows on their own are of a great
quality also the makeup geek eyeshadows
I have them in my kit right now so I can
show them but the makeup geek eyeshadows
are so affordable
so pigmented is so worth their buck you
will not regret getting any of these
because they all rock then also I've
been obsessing over the lorac unzipped
palette especially like the first half
year of this year this has been all I
wore on my face like day to day wise not
so much for videos but like on a
day-to-day basis where I did not feel
this would be on my eyes because I mean
look at it it's got all the Nickey
colors you could ask for it's got your
mats it's got your really pretty
shimmering shiny colors and it's all
like super rose gold II and bronze II
and champagne II and warm and brown and
oh this belt just hits all the right
feels and then also another palette that
I've only have for a month but has
changed my life for good is the tartlet
at palette by Tarte this eyeshadow
palette is like neutrals on crack I love
this palette so much it's all divided
into warms colds and neutrals which
makes it perfect for anyone and everyone
in planet Earth because you will find a
match in this one
it's just great palette
it's great pellets my favorite eyeliner
this year by far and it has completely
changed how I approach eyeliner is the
Kat Von D tattoo liner in trooper watch
a random tutorial of mining if this will
probably pop up this is the best and I'm
gonna say it the best liquid eyeliner
ever it's completely fade away mica
trees dating Jo black liquid liner it's
I don't even look at that anymore all I
can think about is Kathleen D tattoo
liner in trooper so quickly onto lips I
don't have a lot my favorite lip liner
of 2014 is Mac's stripped down because
it's just a darker more cool shade and
you can really like I'm wearing it on
the outer part of my lips to die and it
just makes it look so plump and pretty
and good and nice and it's just a great
lip pencil I also do love the other lip
liners my la girl the nude one
especially it's also my cat I'm so sorry
lip glosses this year the best were the
NYX of butter glosses I can't think of a
better gloss this year because these
smell so good and my number one favorite
is maple blondie but I left it in Mexico
so my second favorite is creme brulee
and it actually smells like creme brulee
and creme brulee is my most favorite
dessert ever and creme brulee is the
shiznit
and especially this glosses in the novel
bit and therefore lipsticks this year my
all-time favorites have been the Kat Von
D everlasting liquid lipsticks and then
Pyrrha and outlaw the formula and these
are absolutely amazing they don't dry
nor do they hydrate the lips which I'm
fine with as long as they don't dry it
and it's just so pigmented so easy to
use and it lasts all day long and it's
just so gorgeous and I love liquid
lipsticks so those are my favorite
products of 2014 these are my
ride-or-die I cannot live without these
and they will probably go with me into
2015
so 2014 has been insane I've traveled a
lot I went to San Francisco with benefit
I went to Mexico to do my first Beach
campaign shoot ever lots and lots of
things happened this year
and I've worked my ass off to get where
I am right now
and I can't believe how awesome 2014 has
been as a year you definitely made 2014
a huge success and therefore I want to
thank you I also want to give a special
shout-out this year to add Essie Perkins

icons collab where she did Sophia Loren
and I did Peggy Moffitt and normally

lot anymore and with Jesse we

have none I know more recently told me
that whenever there's a hype and people
seem to love it I seem to be the only
one putting it in there Oh God knows I
don't know why that is I'm not doing it
on purpose but today is another day
where is it gonna happen damn girl no do
you want me to kill all that your spray
I really don't get a lot of heights on
the Internet and this is one of them
people have told me to use this fall in
love with it forever use it and that's
it I tried it in San Francisco to the
Alcatraz party I gave it like five or
six hours and I had to powder I had to
do like stuff with my skin to make it
look good again it did what maybe I'm
doing something wrong I shook the hell
out of it
recently the bargain beauty brand mua
made its way over to holland and i was
like finally and i was like yes
the color amazeballs the packaging super
cute and the fun thing is is that
there's a lipstick in the back I was
like that's just made for perfection so
I tried the lipstick out and basically
it was just it was dry it looked it just
went into the nooks and crannies of the
lips it just went into lines it looked a
little bit as if a peachy-keen man came
over her lips it was not a success this
is the Smashbox be legendary lip gloss
in black tide and I got this color and
it's black it's glittery and in some
white it has pink orange green blue red
tiny mini sort of glitter spots and in
it injected in it and I was like this is
gonna be my black glossy glittering
disco heaven holy ground oh that's so
nice of your Smashbox I didn't know that
 see-through gray was in right
now so I was like okay
shanell it's low volume it's waterproof
I always always use one improvements
cameras because they hold that curl and
I put this on expecting to have the best
lashes in the world and like after 10
seconds they went from like I'm trying
L'Oreal recently came out with their
nudes line they got six lipsticks or
more inspired by the stars the L'Oreal
collection PV by Doutzen the color riche
Doutzen Newt God could it be any longer
