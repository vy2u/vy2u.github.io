and 'god knows my top beauty picks up
the year 2015 and where we also look
back at the greatest 'god knows of the
year it's going to be a long video i'm
scared to death to miss out on any
product i've been loving this year and
then after editing finding out that i
actually forgot about their product and
then hating myself for the rest of the
year but i think i have everything that
I've been loving in 2015 most of them
you already know but it's nice to give
them a little bit more of a spotlight
here on my channel let's do it alright
the first product I want to talk about
as my 2015 all-time favorite product of
course without a doubt is going to be my
Nivea men aftershave balm insensitive I
found out about this last year I don't
exactly remember but I believe I ran out
of moisturizer so I was looking through
Rick's stuff and I saw this aftershave
balm in there and I was like you know
what got no moisturizer why not give it
a go because I need my moisturizer and I
remember applying this in the morning
and then just putting my foundation on
overtop and just doing my entire my mask
and I just noticed my face looking so
good the entire day so that made me kind
of suspicious and it was like okay what
what did that what did I use that made
it go so beautiful the entire day and we
weren't living together back then so the
next day I again had to use this as my
moisturizer and again I noticed my
makeup looking so flawless all day long
and ding-ding-ding of course then I
figured out it must be this and then I
started looking up the ingredients and
then I found out that glycerin makes
products stick to the skin and this has
glycerin as the second most used
ingredient which what that will do is
make products stick to it and it's so
awesome to see so many people try it out
now so many gurus trying it out now and
it feels great when people say it works
because I found out about something that
works okay next up my makeup forever
Ultra HD foundation jokes these change
my foundation game and it hurts it
always kind of hurts me when I have to
use a different foundation in my videos
because I don't want to get repetitive
and use the same stuff over and over
even though I kind of do that all the
time especially during winter wonder
week I had to change these up and it
hurt me so bad because I really wanted
to wear them every single day when I am
Telling You this foundation is so
amazing please trust me because it truly
truly is and because it's a stick and
you use a darker color you can do a
little bit of contouring with it by far
my favorite foundation of 2015 I already
feel like I'm missing out on stuff okay
concealer I had two favorites in 2015
the it cosmetics bye bye under-eye and
light this will forever probably be my
all-time favorite concealer ever because
it is so pigmented if I wanted to cover
up my nipples it would probably cover up
my nipples it's so pigmented it's so
amazing I love so much I can't live
without it and the other concealer I've
been really really enjoying last year
naked skin by urban decay and this is
just a tad bit less pigment tip it's
still amazing but also a little bit more
dry it's just an awesome concealer but
not as awesome as a cosmetics but still
awesome
it's amazing nevermind favorite
contouring powder of the year definitely
has been NYX blush in taupe I know I
kind of strayed away from this and used
um what did I use that Illamasqua as
heroine i shadow um but that one day
just walked out on me I I still have no
idea where it went and then I went back
to NYX blush and taupe and I remembered
all the good old days and I was like why
did I ever give up are you and I'm so
sorry and I hope you could forgive me
we're in relationship therapy right now
but we're making out right back and
we're doing great favorite bronzer for
my skintone this year last year has been
two-faced milk chocolate bronzer light
to medium milk chocolate bronzer it just
bronzes me up man and it just makes me
look nice and bronzy without having
hybrid on voluma helmet
on my face I'm telling you if you're my
skin tone try this out for bronzer it's
so good I have a couple of favorite
blushes of the Year luminoso of course
Milani Luminoso I'm wearing it today I
also have not used this for a little bit
and I feel so bad about it because now
that I'm wearing it again today I'm like
Hello where you been and then during the
last portion of 2015 I really really
gotten to know Sigma as a brand and I
discovered these aura powders in
nymphaea and pet-name and these two
together are just if they could come out
with a blush that is a mixture of the
youth Shu and could colleague Nicki I
would I would not mind I would
thoroughly support that and I would
probably help him do something with them
hey call me up Sigma hey these two
blushes are just so amazing and
especially if you're getting one out of
the tube get Nymphaea because Nymphaea
makes my inside are you ready for this
one favorite highlighters of 2015 mmm
2015 for me was the year of glow like I
learned how to like properly whoop some
glow on the cheeks I have decided that
my two favorite highlighters of the year
my most favorite by far Perl by Becca
I'm not saying that they brought this
big for me they probably had it planned
all along but the fact that after we
made some roar about Becca and making
pearl permanent and they actually did
makes me feel kind of good and again
they probably had it planned all of but
I feel cool about it and my second
favorite highlighter of the year of
course starlight by Anasazi Beverly
Hills this is what I described as the
grown-up more experienced in life a
highlighter sister of pearl so pearl is
like the young crazy one and Starlight
is like the matured older more classy
sister quick shout-out to a nylon
eyeshadow by MAC Cosmetics because it
makes my inside fix my insides highlight
like no other because it makes my inner
corners highlight like no other
if you're pale like me almost every
shade it's too dark to highlight with
and nylon I mean I'm on to something
inner corners right now and it looks
super duper highlight it it looks lit oh
crap I forgot a concealer okay another
concealer I've dyed over is by Makeup
Forever this is their palette a5
camouflage cream palette this is just
the old-school cream concealer that
everyone on YouTube used in 2010 and I
bought it in 2015 fell in love with it
and recommended to everything like if
you want to keep on like covering up
those nipples with concealer this will
also do that so we've come to the point
of eyeshadows and I think that is almost
impossible because I love I shadow so
much and I love so many of them came up
with like general brands not really
specific colors I think okay first
palette by morphe a 35 oh when this came
out everyone and their mama lost their
 so did I my mom didn't so the 35o
palette is girl if you do not own this
yet can we talk face to face it doesn't
get more pretty and warm brownie than
this if you love warm smokey eyes and
like warm Browns this is the one when
Natasha Danone at contacted me and was
like hey I want to send you my
eyeshadows I was okay
once my funeral I freaking love Natasha
to Nona eyeshadows with a passion are
you ready
I mean haha
sometimes I just put these in my room
and stare at them for a good hour and
appreciate their beauty and then hug him
and sometimes kiss them there is no
texture like Natasha - no no I should
have textures because they are so creamy
and buttery and pigmented and Natasha
even told me that when she created this
her lab told her are you sure you want
him to be this pigmented we don't think
people
really like that well she gave her a lap
a good middle finger and told him to
make him like that and I'm so glad she
did because amazing not gonna lie they
are expensive if you want to try out any
Tosh I don't know no I should have just
order one to like feel that texture fall
in love and then save up for more that's
what makeup geek came up with the matte
shadows or the foils oh god yeah I lost
my bananas I love these so much I again
I don't want to go into specifics but
just this row this row right here of
foiled eyeshadows and my microphone I'm
trying to tell everyone I love them
still okay enough about eyeshadows it's
time to move on
Oh glitter by far my favorite glitters
of 2015 by far the heavy metal glitter
liners by urban decay is what everyone
needs in their life because glitter has
never been so accessible and easy to
apply as with these and I'm telling you
if you only get Midnight Cowboy and glam
rock you are good to go
because a gold and a silver go with
everything and I'm trying to think of
something to convince you that you need
these two glitters in your life because
do you do and it will completely change
your like way of thinking about glitters
because glitters are messy and they're
like the herpes of makeup with this it's
so easy to apply it it's so gorgeous and
just get okay let's make a deal just get
the golden to silver try it out fall in
love and just enjoy glitter on a daily
basis like I do favorite eyelash glue
that this eyelash glue changed the game
for me the house of lashes eyelash glue
in clear and black I'm telling you don't
ever think about duo again because do
you can wait a millennium for duo to get
tacky and with this it just gets hacking
like a minute this is the only glue that
will keep my lashes on all day long
until I rip them off okay let's go on to
lips there's only one lip pencil I want
to smear all over my face
that's strip down my Mac that's all I'm
gonna say about it okay first of all I
think the best liquid lipstick
formulation of 2015 word my Jeffrey star
and I'm not saying that because Jeffrey
is my friend I believe that the
Jeffrey's are lipsticks have the best
formulation
I feel like Kat Von D also superflee
Hills and Oprah come near it like like
they're almost there but not burnt
Jeffery it's like Jeffrey's formula is
so America free today on my lips today
is the mixture of Jeffrey's celebrity
skin one of my year's favorites and posh
spies the Kat Von D bow and arrow and
Requiem I feel like these two together
also should be made into one shade no
but like honestly these two are amazing
and again I feel like you need this in
your life if you would ask me what I
have to go for Requiem or a bow and
arrow I would say guide both but if
you're on a budget go for bow and arrow
but since that's always sold out go for
Requiem oh god you're gonna die my
favorite new lipstick of of 2015 has
been my melt and it's in the color nude
I also really like the color sexed but
that is like super super like super
light it's like a very intense not as
intense as nude and therefore a nude is
my absolute favorite new lipstick of
2015 and probably forever and ever until
they stop making it but I love it so
much and it's absolutely disgusting that
I completely ruined it it got everywhere
in the tube and the lipstick came loose
it's like hanging on to do but it's my
favorite new lipstick of 2015 I have
three more favorite brushes for the face
first of all the morphe M 530 the
perfect contour brush like I contoured
with it today I contour with it every
day and it's just well you love
contouring you will love this brush same
goes for this one the morphe M through
10 if you love highlighter you will love
this brush if you love a good glow this
has got to go in with the routine and
that's it
I'm not sure that's it those were all my
top beauty pick I'm like sweating right
now I have sweaty armpits really feel
like 2015 was just one big dream that I
still have to wake up from and that's
all because of you - because you
constantly show me all your support love
amazing comments funny stories you guys
are so amazing and you helped make 2015
so so so rad and all I can say thank you
thank you for giving me all these
opportunities for always watching me for
always believing in me for always
showing support and loving me and and
whenever I feel down and you all know
what I'm talking about now when I feel
down and there's something really
intense going on with my family right
now with my little brother
and um the fact that you without even
meeting me in real life or without even
really knowing me truly support me in
whatever I do
and bring me up when I feel down and
nothing can replace that feeling and I
love you guys so so so much and I truly
honestly would not know what to do with
myself in my life if I did not have all
you amazing people in my life from the
bottom of my heart I want to thank you
for making 2015 so bloody amazing I love
you so much and to wrap it all up let's
take a look at 2015's greatest oh god
knows I love you oh yeah no NARS eda
brush because whenever I would contour
my nose with this one I would look like
Squidward from SpongeBob it 100% pure
argan oil in lights
this oil doesn't - jack okay this
is gonna rock my socks off it just looks
like it's gonna make you look like
Aphrodite of all people NYC City proof
24-hour waterproof mascara sounds good
dozen we're good trust me when I say you
don't need this in your life and I have
tried to make this work so many times
but every time I try it it
like wet pure origins ginseng refreshing
eye cream hood I love you but no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
