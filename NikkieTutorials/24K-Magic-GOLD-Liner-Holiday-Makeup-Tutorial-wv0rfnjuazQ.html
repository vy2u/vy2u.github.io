makeup tutorial on this very luxurious
sexy makeup look originally I wanted to
do a basic ass halo smokey eye but I
wanted to judge it up a little bit make
it bougie up in here so I went for 24
karat magic eyeliner um seriously I'm
obsessed with this 24-carat magic gold
liner perfect for the holidays perfect
for Christmas perfect for for when you
want to cut a hater out there in half
day five of winter wonder week I am
ready for you
so if you're planning on slaying your
family during Christmas and you want
your makeup to last all day long or all
night long on Christmas Eve you want to
prime because if you don't prime how
you're going to keep it on so urban
decay recently launched a couple of new
products and they came out with this b6
vitamin infused complexion prep priming
spray so it's not a setting spray it's
step four riding straight and then they
also came out with primers and this one
is called D slick it has shined control
pore minimizing and a meta fiying it
okay I like that and this one right here
is called self adjusting which has
adapting pigments Oh soft focus effect
and shine control soft focus you won me
over get that RuPaul Vaseline on me now
okay so comes out as white and then oh
my god do you see that it turns into a
car what all right time for flawless
skin I'm gonna go in with the Loreal Pro
matte infallible foundation and I'm in
the color 101 I'm a 101 and I'll be
applying this using my Tarte quickie
sponge
you
going in with a little bit of concealer
and I a little I mean more than enough
now if you like me get a lot of creases
in your concealer on your under eyes now
is the time to bake and set it for the
rest of the day as setting the rest of
my face using a Charlotte Tilbury
airbrush flawless finish powder
honestly at this point I don't want to
talk about it anymore I'm going to go in
with the ultimate winter wonder week I
shoulda palette the morphe 35o m and i'm
taking this color right here as a
transition in my inner and outer corners
and using soft circular motions I'm
applying this color to the inner and
outer corner to start off this halo I
now going in with this deeper warmer
Brown to build definition on the inner
and outer corners even more and the most
important thing about this halo smoky
eye is that we keep the center of the
lid completely bare so do not connect
the inner and outer corners in the
center
and now going into this deep brown to
intensify it
evil are
on the center of the lid I'm applying
Cosette Zen eyeshadow for the 24 karat
gold liner I'm taking this Pat McGrath
Double L five pigments in gold and oh my
god I want to marry this and to make a
delicate liner I'm mixing it with the
mixing liquid so then grab a little bit
from your mixture and make your line and
there you have your 24 karat gold liner
up sess on the lower lash line I'm just
applying that darkest Brown from left to
right all the way through
and lastly blinding my inner corners
using jus waste ice mini highlighter
this is quickly becoming one of my
all-time favorite inner corner
highlighters for lashes today I'm going
to go in with Lily lashes Monaco already
our eyeliner is ready to cut a fader in
half so let's do the same with our
cheeks I'm gonna go in with my Kevin
Kwan medium sculpting powder I know I'll
use my makeup geek contouring powder
tomorrow so I used a total of three
contouring products this week at this
technique I'm literally still so
obsessed I'm so glad I tried it out this
winter one week it just oh it just all
for blush and going for a nice pinky
touch because if everything is too Brown
and too warm tone it's gonna make you
look a little sickly really fast so I'm
gonna perk this up using some pink up in
here
so I'm gonna go in with the Mac blush in
what I fancy and I'm gonna place my
blush a little higher up onto my
cheekbones I was washing a Korean makeup
tutorial last night and they applied
their blush really high up like right
underneath the eyes really high up and I
loved what it did like obsessed
and for highlighters today I'm going to
keep it simple and go in with one of my
all-time favorites
the sleek solstice highlighting palette
this is affordable and everything you
want for your highlighter dreams oh just
stop just stop
and for lips I'm going to go in with
this Oprah a liquid lipstick in the
colour South Hollow did I say that wrong
Oh literally how stunning is that lip
color Oh fur always turns up the game
they always up I love Oprah so much all
right I want it to be just a tiny bit
neuter so I'm going in with this Mac
lipstick and lazy lullaby just a tiny
bit all right some setting spray to lock
it in for the rest of the day and we're
done
and that guys concludes this 24-carat
magic fold of the ah that guys concludes
my 24 karat gold eyeliner holiday makeup
