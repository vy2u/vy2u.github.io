look at my face you see a lot of things
happening especially the glitter and
hello can we take a second for this
necklace right the broken nail can we
take a second for this necklace right
here and these earrings honey I got some
ear candy going on so if you're a
subscriber to my channel you know that a
couple of videos ago I did a video
focusing on the Siobhan she black blush
and it went sort of like this what is
this fingers what's your fingers babe oh
yeah it was a mess
it was a hot fiery mess but in those
comments a couple of you said you have
to try I know you don't like this blush
but you have to try the following
product by Shivam she it is a slime /
pudding highlighter that's that what
these Yvonne she here we go and here's
my friend she's the highlighter memoir
the deform memoir deform so this right
here is a slime / pudding / jelly
highlighter and you know just because I
didn't like that black blush from
Givenchy doesn't mean I hate their
entire collection I'm not on their
perilous I've never worked with them but
you know what let me just go ahead and
see if this is any good so it comes in a
really big pop when I first ordered this
and it came in I thought it was a
moisturizer pot it's a hefty little jar
so here is what it looks like and this
is in the color pink ink so the Givenchy
highlighter memoir deform in number one
pink ink and like I said a little bit
earlier I am wearing my makeup today I
did contouring I did bronzing I did the
eyes I did everything except for
highlighter so I feel like a part of me
is missing I feel like I did my face
without my fingers which is basically
true cuz I'm missing nails
I feel so incomplete without highlighter
that I cannot wait to try this out
so let's take a closer look at this baby
right here and see if I like this better
than the black blush alright so here we
are so when I look it up online here it
is on net apart a Givenchy beauty memoir
deform highlighter retails for $45 $45
is hefty but who knows it's gonna blind
us and make our dreams come true so the
description says Schiavone she beauty's
memoir deform highlighter casts the skin
in a whole new light with just a swipe
of the finger tip packed with pink cute
micro pearls this blendable gel formula
will quickly boost your complexions
natural radiance suitable for all skin
types and tones so here I have it and
when I open it up it looks like this in
here is the little slime pudding of a
highlighter it smells so good it's like
you're walking in a garden of fresh
roses and usually I'm not that into the
scent of roses but this is a very spring
sort of fresh type of rose is there a
type of rose that has that definition
but if you do not like any scent in your
product this will be a no-go because
that's pretty intense it's a good
intense I mean I really like it anyways
and when I tilt the pot forward give it
a second
but the slime / pudding will come out
here comes here it comes the slime is
coming down okay okay alright so I'm
gonna actually touch the slimy part as
you can see it is literal slime /
pudding / jelly okay so before we do
anything first let's just see what the
color looks like and what it will look
like on the skin so I'm picking some up
on my finger here we go and then now I'm
gonna swatch you swatch
okay so it definitely has a little tint
to it it has a baby pink sort of hue to
it and as I'm blending it it feels very
very soft the only thing I'm noticing is
that it is pretty wet and it's not
really really reflective I feel like
this is one of those highlighters that
will be so gorgeous if you're going for
that wet skin type of look but now that
I'm talking to camera it is starting to
dry in a little bit so I feel like this
starts off as a wet highlighter so this
is very editorial this is for flash
photography this is for when you want
your skin to have a beautiful dewy glow
and then it actually dries in and still
gives you that wetness so let's see what
this looks like on the face of what I'm
gonna be doing is I'm gonna be putting
it on my cheek with my fingers and then
seeing what it does to the skin and just
you know what let me stop talking start
doing make up first I want to use it as
just by itself so I'm going to dip my
finger in the lid again and pick up the
Highness a little bit and with my finger
I'm gonna be tapping it onto my
highlight area oh that is really pretty
so I'm tapping it very lightly onto the
highest points of my cheek and one thing
I'm noticing right ahead
it's not disrupting the base I have
never ever in my life
worked with a cream or wet highlighter
on top of powdered foundation skin that
didn't just like disrupt the base like
usually when you put something wet on
something dry it just totally clashes
and it starts balling up and it starts
leaving marks or holes or disrupting the
base underneath this is the first
highlighter in my life that is not doing
that so far so now that I'm tapping it
in it is drying so now once I touch it
again it's actually dried into the skin
and it is the leaving meat with this
this for flash photography on a stunning
model like wet dewy skin glossy hair
glossed their stunning product now what
I would experiment with it is trying
this as a base and then once it almost
destroyed pact that highlighter on top
and baby you got boom you got the big
bang on your face so this is what the
highlighter looks like one coat just the
highlighter on powder foundation skin
and I must say that it's it's very soft
but it's making my skin look wet
sash natural almost like a what in what
way will this ever look natural I mean
I'm wearing glitter on my eyeballs but I
feel like it gives the skin a little bit
more do eNOS at luminosity so so far
really really good now let's pack on
some more so we get that witness back
and then pack a highlighter on top
I felt tingles downstairs when I said
that I'm excited all right picking some
up on my finger again going over it one
more time and as you're tapping you
already feel it becoming a little bit
more dry so I'm now gonna grab a little
bit of nylon eyeshadow by Mac really
quickly and tapping lease tapping lease
at that baby we hit the jackpot with
this one so nylon on top of an almost
dried in Jilin she slime highlighter is
what highlight dreams are made of oh my
god oh my god who even wants to talk
about that black blush she won she this
is what the people need so I didn't do
any blush yet so I am gonna add a little
bit of that I'm gonna mix these two
together by Mac alright guys so as I'm
applying my blush thought so far what do
you think are you impressed are you like
that's a hassle are you like anything
for that glow in my life don't you let
me know in the comments down below I
wouldn't know what your first thoughts
are right now you can pause me out
wait but definitely let me know what you
think so far I will tell you that I was
skeptical I saw this online I ordered it
I just came in i just opened the pot and
i was like i don't know about this just
now and now that it is on me and i set
it with nylon and it looks bomb this is
a good day this is a good day the
dipping looks so cool like when you dip
it look at it like this is how you
highlight when you are a glow fanatic if
you are all about that glow in your life
and you're looking for facetune glow in
real life this is it like this is what
people do in facetune to make their glow
look like the glow that you see on
instagram although this is real life i
mean this is this is real life alright
now what else can i highlight Who am I
kidding everything hitting tip of the
nose hit in the tip just the tip and
then I also want it right here I've been
doing this lately and people have been
asking me if I got a nose job no honey
is just tricking the eye with
highlighter and contour so just on the
bridge here take it to the bridge drop
some nylon tap over top and boom boom
boom I want this highlighter in my room
alright so I'm definitely starting to
feel a lot more like myself again
blow mama is back so let me touch up my
lips I used Smashbox always on liquid
lipstick in the colour spoiler alert and
let me just do a quick touch-up and to
finish the only thing I need right now
is some setting spray so this is what
the Givenchy highlighter looks like on
my skin set with a reflective eyeshadow
so woah the fact that this is a wet
product that didn't mess up my base
underneath means so much to me because I
will use the the metallic drops by cover
effects I will
use anything reflective but wet and I
will work it into the skin and my base
is ruined my base is done and the fact
that this did not do that already makes
me love this it also is fairly easy to
use you tap it in with a finger just tap
tap tap tap tap and as you're tapping
you feel it becoming more dry then hit
it with a shadow or highlighter or
something that you want more shine out
of or just want to power it up a little
bit more and bam you're glowing I will
say that I think this is prettier when
you do bronzing contouring than this
highlight and then blush because if you
have some harsh edges that you want to
blend out a little bit more the blush
can kind of graze over top and just fix
everything for you but I feel like a
glowing goddess and I feel like I'm
gonna use this a lot more often
especially a lot more often than the
black blush but a lot more often just in
general in life so I am a fan there's a
joo voz a product that i love and the
only downside to this product it is $45
it's a big jar though you get 30 grams
of product which is 1.05 ounces which is
a lot of product and you only meet the
slightest dip into the slime into the
pudding into the jelly and you're good
to go for like one side of the cheek but
like I always say in all my videos
prices and how much worth a product is
is such a personal matter like if you
think $45 for this product is way too
flippin much it's way too flippin much I
do not have the ability to look into
your your personal matters or your
wallets and that I'm gonna leave that
totally up to you I feel like it's on
the higher set of the spectrum but she
fun she is a luxury brand so that is to
be expected but I do think it's worth it
but that's just me definitely let me
know in the comments down below what you
think of this product and if after this
video you're interested in buying it

down below in the comments and before I
go I do want to let you know about a
