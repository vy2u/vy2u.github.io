today I will be doing a tutorial
completely and especially for the 4th of
July Independence Day for America so I
decided to come up with a wearable look
that basically anyone can wear but of
course with a Nicki touch so something
underneath the eyes and just colors and
eyeliner and Nicki so I decided to put
the blue on my eyeliner the stars of the
flag underneath my eyes a red pout and
then white as your clothing or nails and
that is just sort of my take on this
entire fourth of July stick if you want
to know how to get this look for the
fourth of July or for any type of day
where you want blue red and white and
stars then please keep on watching so
the first thing you want to do of course
is apply a base tier eyelets to prevent
the eyeshadow and anything you're
putting on top from creasing and I am
using my trusty old Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot ok so for this look of course the
main colors are blue red and white and I
try to find a way to kinda mix these
colors together in a fashionable way
because sometimes I feel like these
colors can really clash and I really
wanted to keep it all fashionable so in
order to make it all a bit more wearable
as well I'm first going to define my
crease with a soft nude color now you
can choose whatever new color you want
just take a color that will slightly
deepen your crease from my Naked 1
palette I am choosing naked and with
this just to find your crease a bit and
I know and I already got comments on my
Instagram when I showed a preview like
but you edit Brown and the only colors
you should be using our red white and
blue I was like yeah but you sort of
want to make it wearable as well and if
there's one color that makes bright
colors wearable its Brown so go ahead
and just define that crease a little bit
more with a neutral color then to Metin
down my brow bone I'm gonna take my lu
le skin fix powder pack to number 21 No
with this I'm going to Matan down my
brow bone and inner corners and now
going in with a fluffier brush and naked
again I'm just going to blend that
crease out even more and make it
seamless to highlight my brow bone even
more I'm going to take Mac's
vanilla pigment and just apply that
under the highest point of your eyebrows
I'm going to put a light champagne gold
color on my lids and this is max pigment
in blonds gold just all over on the
inner third outer third and the middle
just everything for a pop of glamour
Sparkle I'll be taking my makeup studio
dual effects and shine and apply that to
my inner corners quite widely like don't
be afraid to use this so as you can see
I put that on quite heavily just to give
that I are really nice opener and
because it's a party
on my waterline I will be using my Ben
Nye neutralizer cream crayon in red
concealer number one in mp3 and you can
substitute this for white personally I'm
not a fan of white eyeliner on my
waterline because I feel like it's too
harsh so I go for a more neutral color
and now it's time for the iconic blue
eyeliner and what I will be using for
this is my Urban Decay liquid liner in
radium this color is shimmering and I
wanted my color to be sort of like a
satin finish so first I will be applying
the radium liquid liner right Urban
Decay but then on top I'm going to add a
mascara and this is by poopa and this is
called the vamp mascara and this is
number 301 which is the perfect bright
royal blue so that will be going on top
so this is the eyeliner with Urban
Decay's radium and this is a bit too
shiny and glittery for my liking so I'm
going to put the put my Milano mascara
on top for a matte bright effect and
this is the eyeliner after a layer of
the mascara much more opaque and much
more bright and much more blue which is
a good thing now it's time for the
holographic stars underneath my eyes
when I do like a strong eyeliner look I
always like to put something underneath
my eyes and because the American flag
has stars I decided to put little stars
underneath my eyes and just get my
creativity here the stars I will be
using are by Barry M and this is a berry
M glitter stacking set in number 13 and
it has hearts and it has glitter but it
also has miniature sort of little ditzy
holographic stars and I'm gonna take
four of those and sort of apply them in
a circle so you kind of get a circle
underneath your eyes but in the shape
stars and I just felt like that was
really new and to apply these I'm just
gonna dot a little bit of lit clearly
liquid glitter base underneath my eyes
and then take a dotting tool for your
nails then pick up a star place it pick
another one up place it place it place a
place to place it yeah seedot seedot
seedot see one two three four and then
just kind of push them in the right
direction so sort of like in the shape
you want them to be and holy moly by
boldly you have holographic star circles
under your eyes and I love it okay so
for the face prior to filming I already
contoured and warmed up a bit so I
contoured it using my NYX taupe blush my
favourite so I just contoured with that
and just
put away some stuff that shouldn't be
here then I wound up my face using my
Illamasqua blush in disobey and my Mac
bronzer in nude on board and I'm
actually gonna apply a little bit more
of nude on board for a little bit more
warmth for blush it's completely up to
you what you want to do with this I'm
gonna go for a nice a pinky tone because
I feel like blue red and white and pink
really go nice together so I'm gonna
take pinch o peach blush drive in it
which is a really nice pinky color and
just use a really tiny bit of this and
put it on the apples of the cheeks and
then for a glowy fashionable highlight
I'm gonna take my Mac vanilla pigment
and just highlight on my cheekbones my
nose Cupid's bow a little bit on the
chin and a little bit above my brows for
that ultimate sort of glowy healthy glow
oh this is like youth in a pod
for the lips I decided to go with my
holy grail rat lipstick lip product
look mix this is the Mac lip mix in
crimson this is the perfect blue toned
rat lipstick and I'm going to hide that
to my lips and then to clean up the
edges and make everything as sharp as
possible I'm going to use my Mac Faye
somebody in c1 and my OCC skin concealer
in i won
and that guy's completes my fourth of
July Independence Day America themed
makeup tutorial so yeah this is my take
