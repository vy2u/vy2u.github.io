and exciting ROM we dot-com haul for you
I got the chance to order a couple of
things and with a couple I mean a lot I
found this website through grade your
girl here on YouTube and I absolutely
love her go check her out she is so
funny and of course if you're going to
take her out then tell her that I send
you thank you okay so wrong we calm
I found this throughout graveyard girl
again and she showed some clothes that
she buy and I was like oh that's fun
so I looked at the website and I fell in
love I even tweeted about it and Here I
am showing you my home I guess the first
item that I got is the shirt or like the
sweater that I'm actually wearing right
now and I'm gonna look up the name for
you so you can actually type it in on
the website and get it if you really
want to get it okay this is the
gold-tone riveted mint jumper and I love
this it is so nice and and warm but of
course the thing that makes me love it
the most are the studs the damn
shoulders I love the color I love how
the the neck part is with my body
because I kind of feel like these sort
of openings of the neck or we look look
at that my skin is so sensitive when I
do look at it one two three red I
expected it to be a little bit more
loose and bigger but that's kind of
because I always wear loose-fitting
clothes because I feel more comfortable
with that but I love this I'm just gonna
suck it in a little bit more but I love
this and it's not uncomfortable I mean I
can move and I'm I'm good
but I love this I took me a moment to
say that next are these starry night
leggings and I am a legging whore the
only thing I wear around my ass are
leggings and charts to kind of cover up
any anything that has to be covered up
but I am a legging fanatic I love
leggings I love leggings with a print I
love weird leggings I love leggings with
all this stuff going on so when I found
the leggings page on wrong weed
come I went crazy I wanted them all but
I only decided to go for three
only three it's funny how the front is
lighter and where your ass is it's
darker I love you for that wrong we
thank you for helping me out with that
one the next leggings I got are the
burning fire leggings and I adore these
I can just see myself just walking in a
room and be like wow is it me or is it
hot in here I am on fire there are so
many options where you can just break
the ice with with leggings like leggings
are the new icebreakers of 2013 this is
the front so you have that explosion
going on and then you have some stars
and then on your ass area is again a
darker sort of galaxy part I love this
the next I got the cross printed swing
shirt and this is just a really sheer
blouse with crosses on it and when I
wear this I feel super hipster I
actually wore it in the tutorial for
this look right here so if you're
wondering well I told you in the video
that it's from Rami but this is the
cross swing cross cross printed swing
shirt something and again I thought it
was going to be a little bit bigger
because it's a little bit tight around
my shoulders but that's because I'm why
does a bear I have to deal with that
then next I got a little bit of faux fur
because I've never bought anything fur
well flow for wise and I saw someone
walking in Amsterdam and she kind of she
walked by and I went like stalker mode
and I went like this she was wearing
crazy leggings faux fur and then some
crazy top and I was like haha can we be
best friends she walked by too fast so
we could have looked this is the faux
fur she let she let it looks so stuff
you just want to put your head in it and
and sleep on it it's so soft and I'm
gonna call it gizmo because I don't know
why but it just looks like a gizmo okay
the last thing I have for you guys is
the story
anomalous anomalous shift dress and this
is again one of those galaxies sort of
star we printed stuffs but it's dress
look it's green and mouths green and
blue and black and bronze and it has a
neckline like that and it's really
really long and it has one of those like
high-low backs which I absolutely love
because when I wear something like that
I feel like that man so that is
everything that I bought from romwe com
a couple of weeks ago shipping was about
it took about two and a half weeks to
get here which is okay because they come
from I believe Japan or China but two
and a half weeks is really reasonable
because normally China or Japan takes
like two months for me so I was happy I
do have to say that some of the prices
are a little bit too much for me where
I'm like but that is $70 I'm like you
gave that $70 and you gave that 20
what's going on
you

concludes my romwe comm hall I hope you

to do a sauce so thank you guys so much
