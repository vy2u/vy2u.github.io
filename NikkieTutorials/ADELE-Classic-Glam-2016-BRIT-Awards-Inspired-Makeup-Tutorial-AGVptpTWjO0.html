inspired by Adele at the 2016 Brit
Awards and how gorgeous did she look
again and a lot of you guys requested a
tutorial for this look so when I did my
research I came across this Telegraph
article and it said Adele wears 12 pound
50 foundation at the BRIT Awards and in
the article I read that they used one of
my all-time favorite foundations by ex1
they used one of my all-time favorite
blushes so that made me want to do it
even more sad today I'm here to show you
this look inspired by Adele from the
2016 Brit Awards I hope you enjoy and if
you want to know how to get this look
then all you have to do is keep on
watching
alright let's transform our face into
Adele alright the first thing I'm gonna
go in with is by Kiehl's and this is
their ultra facial moisturizer and this
helps with dry skin types to get it nice
and moist
I'm so dry lately sucks once I saw a
dense makeup artist Instagram post
I saw the Lucas Lucas's Papa Lucas says
Paw Paw Paw Paw papaya papaya and I got
this in New York at al Cowen's and miss
fame recommended me getting this so when
I saw this in the Instagram post I was
like yeah I have that and Adele worth a
ton rule of sugar a little bit more
moisturizer so I'm gonna worry about
Oswald so in that article they revealed
that Adele was wearing the ex1 cosmetics
invisible foundation and I'm a huge fan
of this I've used this numerous amounts
of times on my channel here so I was
like yes so today this is the foundation
that I'll be using because it's one of
my favorites and Adele wore the color
f-100 is still unaware f-100 and I'm
just going to bounce this in using my
Beauty Blender and I love the finish of
this foundation it just makes you look
naturally photoshopped gorgeous and
again if you don't know where to get
this I'll put a link down below to a
website that ships internationally and
that's where I get mine from
for concealer I'm going to go with my it
cosmetics bye bye on your eye and also
blend that in using your Beauty Blender
and I using the NARS soft velvet loose
powder in snow to bake
I'm already priming my eyelid using the
Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and the Sigma
3d HD precision brush and now with this
Kiko 167 shadow I'm going to set my brow
bone to crease area to help blending
later on a Ferguson musing is a wave a
224 the crease as a transition color and
first going in using Mac's
soft Brown and applying this using a Mac
224 I really softly just start defining
your crease with this and I'm using
super soft pressure so this is what you
want to remember the more pressure you
put on your brush the harsher and more
intense the color will go on so once I
reach this outer portion here I want it
to be super super soft so that's why I
barely put any pressure on my brush to
get a nice blend you want this color to
be quite blown out and diffused and the
higher I get in that crease the last
pusher I use now going in with makeup
geeks Coco bear and my favorite Cosette
s one-eight-five rush and just defining
the crease a little bit more using this
color and because this brush is so
precise you can really start cutting the
crease with this yet maintain a nice
soft blend now going in with makeup geek
americano to darken the whole thing same
brush same pressure same movement just
darkening their crease a little bit and
then I like to go back in with that soft
brown shadow and the 224 by Mac and
really blow out that crease color a
little bit more again for the lid I'm
using the Too Faced peanut butter jelly
palette I love this one so much I'll be
using the color rich and creamy with a
damp brush
and once you got most of that on with
the brush take that gold a little bit
higher up and with this you can clean up
your cut crease with CAF India's tattoo
liner in trooper I'm going to make the
outline of my wing and with Sigma's a
line is a legend I'm going to fill
everything in and I know that's a lot of
product but it works for the lower lash
line I'll be using a mixture of
Americano by makeup geek and Coco bear
and with my favorite lower lash line
brush these zoeva 240 I'm just going to
define the lower lash line and some oak
it out and with a Cosette P 365 I'm
taking cocoa bear only and focusing it
on the inner corners now mixing a little
bit of makeup geeks cherry cola into
that lower lash line mix
and highlighting the inner corners using
this kike 167 eyeshadow mixed with 169
with colourpop's cream gel liner in
swerve I'm going to darken my waterline
all you want to do not to finish office
apply some falsies and these are by
house of lashes and these are the
temptress whispies
you
okay so for teens the first thing we're
gonna do is contour using my Kevyn
Aucoin medium sculpting powder and my
favorite contouring brush this is the
morphe M 530 and below in the screen you
can find a discount code to get some
dollars off your morphe order all right
let's get sculpted
okay then to warm up my complexion a
little bit more abusing this two-faced
milk chocolate bronzer in light/medium
and my favorite brush to do this with is
by Cosette and it's my number one really
lightly just add in some warmth for
blush Adele's makeup artist used another
ex1 cosmetics product and it's one of my
all-time favorite blushes it's pretty
and peach I've been wearing this so much
ever since I got it and the moment I
found out that that was what Adele was
wearing at the Brits I was like yes yes
I'm so much closer to Adele now so I'm
going to apply pretty in peach to my
cheeks using my Cosette number two brush
for that beautiful Adele glow I'm going
to go in with moonstone by Becca and
sunburst by Anasazi Rivoli Hills and
applying this using another morphe
favourite this is the M 310
yes bitch hello from the highlighted
side of course a little bit on the tip
of my nose and my cupids bow and then to
set everything and make it last all day
long I'm going to set using makeup
forever missed em fix alright time for
the beautiful deep Bratz lip the first
product I'm going to go in with is the
brand spanking new Hooda Beauty lip
contour and this is in the color
cheerleader
and fill-in using that same lip contour
and going over top with a little bit of
tart tardis lip paint in bay and that
guy's concludes this Adele at the 2016
