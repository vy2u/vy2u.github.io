on all-mighty Adele Adele has been
slaying everyone on planet Earth I love
Adele she's looking absolutely fantastic
adele is everything I love a gel I love
hello I love 25 she's doing so great
I'm so proud she's representing I love
her this is just that this entire video
is an homage to Adele quickly though
Before we jump into the tutorial I
wanted to mention that I have my
exclusive brush set with Sigma and it
comes with the f-86 which is awesome for
concealer it comes with the sath which
is awesome for foundation and my three
essential eye brushes all by Sigma and
together this comes in a set and we made
this especially for my meet-and-greet in
Minneapolis last week and it's I'm just
so proud that I have a limited edition
brush set that people can get and I'm
mentioning this because it's been
available for like a week or so but
tomorrow it's Black Friday and I wanted
to mention that on Black Friday Sigma
has a special discount code for everyone
so Sigma right now has 48 hours of free
shipping where in those 48 hours right
now and it all ends tomorrow night
Friday night and that means you can get
my nikkietutorials a sigma brush set
with free shipping so i just really
quickly wanted to include that if you're
interested in buying my limited edition
brush set i'm so proud of it
um so yeah if you want it use the code
you can get free shipping if not we're
cool we're cool let's go jump into adele
alright so the first thing we're going
to do is prime this face to get a good
base today i'll be using these
Scandinavian makeup primer spray and I'm
actually loving this I bought the makeup
finishing spray a couple of years ago
and I fell in love with it and now they
came out with her primer spray a couple
of years ago and I've been trying it for
like a month now and it is so so flippin
awesome and why I love this so much is
because it doesn't have any silicone and
the thing is when you put silicone on
your skin throughout the day silicone
gets slippery and that will just make
your face slide and look gross
and this doesn't have
silicon it's got all these amazing
ingredients to just keep your makeup
intact and combined with my Nivea men
aftershave balm this is a killer combo
to keep your makeup on all day long
first I shake shake I shake and if you
use code Nicki at Scandinavia check out
you'll get 15% off plus free shipping
then right after go in with my
aftershave balm and that combo will keep
my face intact
all day long yes now time for foundation
and a trick to make your foundation last
even longer is get that primer spray on
Miss Scandinavia and spritz your Beauty
Blender with it and this will soak up
that spray and it will mix it with your
foundation and that will keep it on
longer the foundation I'll be using
today is by Makeup Forever
this is the ultra HD stick foundation I
tried this in Minneapolis and I felt an
absolute love with it this gives you
such an amazing flawless coverage in
such a little time and it'll it just
looks photoshopped perfect it like
there's fuller on your face so I like to
just go on to my face apply the stick
look like a drag queen
and live for it hello just me and then
with your Beauty Blender start tapping
this into the skin and give yourself
that flawless face I mean can we talk
about the fact that my base just went
from a zero to a hundred a real quick I
love foundation I'm gonna say it
I love the stick foundation version more
than the fluid for concealer I'll be
using it cosmetics bye bye under-eye in
light go crazy
Adele loves her makeup she loves her
flawless face so for once I'm like you
know what honey pack it on and then
again with my Beauty Blender blend that
in
now quickly set everything with powder
so it won't crease and now I'm quickly
going to do my brows off-camera and do
one eye to give my Adele going on and
then I will be back all right the first
thing we're going to do as always is
apply a base I'm using my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot and I'm applying this using a
sigma 3d HD precision brush with a matte
cream color I'm just setting my crease
and brow bone area and this will help
blend out the brown in the crease later
on a lot more now going into the Urban
Decay Gwen Stefani palette and I'm
taking the color zone and with a morphe
M 505 I'm just applying that to the
crease to build definition then also
dragging it down to the outer V and also
making that nice and smoky now I'm going
to grab a little bit of Anaheim and with
the morphe M b23 I'm just blending that
out as a transition color now going in
the Tarte tartlet palette and taking
this color right here and again using
that morphe M 505 and darkening the
outer V and crease for the lid on first
going in with this makeup geek foiled
eyeshadow and this is grandstand with a
Mac 242 I'm just applying that from
lashline to crease for the inner third
I'm taking another foiled eyeshadow by
makeup geek this one is in the spotlight
so the same brush that is going on the
inner third leading up to the crease and
in to grandstand on the inner corners
I'll be applying Urban Decay polyester
bride
for the lower lashline i'm using a mac
228 to apply that same dark brown color
from the tarte lapel it again all you
want to do now is focus on the beautiful
black glitter liner that Adele wore on
SNL so first I'm going to go in with my
Kat Von D ink liner in trooper
then I fill everything in using my Sigma
line ace in legend and then to add that
sparkle I'm taking my Urban Decay heavy
metal glitter liner in gunmetal and
that's just going right over top to open
up the eyes i'm applying fascinating.i
coal by Mac and now all you want to do
to finish off is apply some falsies and
these are hood a beauty Brigitte let's
go on to that contour so first to build
some shape in this space this is by Too
Faced and this is the eldest summer 16
hour long wear bronzer and I'm going to
apply this using my morphe m5 27
so see how that's already sort of giving
my face that sculpture we want to
highlight today I'm going to use the
Becca highlighting palette Jaclyn teal
highlighting palette and I'll be mixing
champagne pop with pearl hello then also
I'm going to highlight the tip of my
nose and the bridge of it right here for
blush I'm going to use my current
favorites these are by Sigma this one
right here is called nymphaea
and this is called pet name and together
this is like my Holy Grail blush
combination I love it so much and I
noticed on Adele that her blush is not
on the apples of the cheeks but it's
like right in the center from the side
so if you look at her from the side it's
like right in the center so it's not on
the apple not further back it's just
right in the center
just blended with the highlight and the
contour and then now what I'm going to
use is the skin Dena via makeup
finishing spray and this is like the
final step towards keeping your makeup
on all day long I love this because I
love working with powders on my face I
love contouring with powders putting
blush on with powders and sometimes all
the powders can make you look a little
bit cakey and then with this finishing
spray if you sprayed on top it will take
away all the excessive powder it will
transform it into a luminous the glowy
godlessness and that's exactly what you
want alright on to lips
Adele loves her nudes but a little bit
warmer and deeper than like a deadly
like very skin Toni nude so I came up
with the following concoction my base
color is going to be by Too Faced this
is the melted nude
then I'm going to make it a little bit
lighter using melted sugar
and then for a gloss over top I'm going
to use these Sigma Olympic lips lip
Eclipse in Seal of Approval and that's
it
and that guys concludes my Adele
inspired makeup tutorial I was inspired

liner Adele's makeup and just Adele
