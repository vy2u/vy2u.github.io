actually doing a very very fun tutorial
because for once on my channel there's
not a lot of expensive stuff because
today we'll be focusing on a affordable
makeup transformation and this all to
celebrate the following this is a
prettier - sit down be humble as you
know one of my all-time favorite
drugstore brands is Maybelline and
here's the exciting new no is Maybelline
and I will be teaming up to give you a
youtube series on their channel called I
make up like this I think this is so
huge and I want to thank Maybelline
again for this amazing opportunity but
there's more to it there's a little
contest going on now I will be the host
of the eye makeup like this series but
we need co-hosts we need you we have
decided to give ten of you the
opportunity to fly out to New York and
film a video with me for the makeup
series so this is how you enter you have
to create a 60 second Instagram tutorial
on a bomb-ass a liner look you know get
creative with minors get crazy with
minors show us your techniques and your
art using eyeliners so when you filmed
your video you've edited it it's ready
to go on Instagram all you have to do is
in your caption hashtag Maybelline
contest and hashtag M&amp;amp;Y
it look unfortunately though this is
open to the US only but I'll put all the
rules down below and all submissions end
September first so get your submissions
in fast and I cannot wait to see who
will join me in I make up like this so
check out all the rules down below and
so in order to celebrate me teaming up
with one of my all-time favorite
drugstore brands I wanted to do an
homage to a drugstore makeup and do an
affordable makeup transformation I have
a really really cool idea in mind so
without any further ado let's get glad
for a foundation today I'm gonna go in
with the Maybelline matte and poreless
fit me foundation in the color 112 and
bounce again into the skin using the
morphe Beauty Blender
do you see how flawless that makes my
skin in one go a drugstore full-coverage
state and even though I have drier skin
this matte finish doesn't look cakey or
dry at all so it's a safe go in me low
grease free concealer I'm gonna go in
with the master conceal by Maybelline as
well I've been wearing this for a couple
of weeks now
and seven that using the Maybelline fit
me powder in five all right now moving
along to the classic airspun in extra
coverage to set the rest of my face and
I make sure I really press the powder in
using a powder puff to make sure it
doesn't budge all day for some basic
shadow in the crease first I'm gonna go
in with the city mini eyeshadow palette
in Mac about town and because I have
hooded eyes I want to define my eyes
like crazy because if I just do the
liner it's gonna look weird on me so I
definitely need that crease in there and
once I have the basic shape outlined I'm
going to go in with a clean blending
brush and buff out the edges
now but all means are not saying that
you have to do this entire crease stuff
when you have beautiful open big eyes
I feel like this liner alone makes such
a statement with concealer I'm gonna cut
the crease and again going higher up to
show a fake lid at least I got that
going on and usually a step right here
but now we're gonna go all the way out
setting it using the lightest color of
this palette now I'm gonna go in with my
absolute favorite product if there's
anything you want to get from this video
it's the liner so oh my god you're gonna
be shook these are the Maybelline master
precise ink metallics and this isn't the
color silver gold these are amazing you
do want to give them a little bit of a
shake to get the glitter and the
metallic Ness going and we're going to
start off with a thick basic winged
liner now for this gold
I think it's prettiest if you do two
layers but this will not budge
throughout the day and I'll use this as
a base for all the glitter will be a
plain go for top but this is everything
now of course you can stop here call it
a day this isn't look in and of itself
but of course I have to go that extra
mile now going to go in with black
comet's stain liner it's the same master
precise ink and we're gonna be doing an
outline surrounding the gold and what
will happen is you need a super thin
liner for this maybe you got it for the
outline liner go easy
take your time sit down don't drink
coffee cuz you'll shake take your time
and do it step by step stroke by stroke
at for glitter I'm gonna take the gold
parts of this little glitter pot and one
by one apply them in a pattern to make
the glitter stick first I'm putting down
a tiny bit of glue
and I know it's very tedious work but
like it is gonna be worth it and there
you have it how cool is that imagine
wearing this like a party or like an
event to like the club Oh going back in
with this Maybelline palette and
defining my lower lash line a little bit
and only going about halfway in and
highlighting my inner corners using that
same lid color and for lashes I'll be
applying the Koko lashes in Queen B oh
my god I am I am living right now like I
would go out to a club right now I want
to do grocery shopping I want to walk
the dogs I want to be seen all right so
for the face I'm gonna go in with this
morphe palette right here this is called
the 9c palette and with this I'll be
bronzing and contouring cuz it's the
only affordable like contour palette
that I have in my collection and you
gotta love the fact that I am bronzing
my face with one of the highlighter
shades you know paste bitch and then for
highlighter I'm gonna go in with this BH
black light highlight sixth color
palette I've talked about these in
favorite videos before my hits and a God
knows these are affordable and so
blinding they feel like they are luxury
makeup and I'm gonna glow myself today
with this one right here called Electra
and anything that's left over in my
brush I go right on the center of the
forehead and like above the arch of your
brow for lips I'm first gonna line them
using the curvy lip pencil in this is by
colour-pop in collaboration with I love
satay Yi Congrats girl this is awesome
and that guy says all their student that
completes this little okay for lipstick
I'm gonna be going in with this
Maybelline lipstick in 915 blushing
beige and as you apply it of course buff
it in with the lip pencil
hmm every lip gloss I'll be using my
favorite at the moment which is
Maybelline's T's a vivid hot liqueur
just scroll through my Instagram and
you'll see this pop up everywhere
alright some said x-ray and this
transformation is complete and that
guy's concludes this affordable a makeup
transformation and dang is it whole
gloom of living this tells you that you
don't need a fortune to look hella glam
cuz you can do it with drugstore makeup
Hey so frightfulness if every single
product mentioned and use go to my
description box below or a
nikkietutorials com I think if you ask
me what my favorite part was of this
entire video it's definitely the liners
I think I have found a new go-to liner
for precision and like sharpness and
like it doesn't bleed I told you in
previous videos how their liners kind of
bleed on the inner corners for me and
these don't and just look how precise
they can be so I think the liner is by
Maybelline are my favorite
of this entire video as well as this
little pallet right here as always if
