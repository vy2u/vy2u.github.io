tutorial and anti Valentine's Day
tutorial because baby asking you people
out there hating and not appreciating
this one's for all of you that are
single and not ready to mingle because
we got makeup this is a look inspired by
like going to the grungy side by going
all vampy with dark lips and really
grungy eyes smoky warm tone eyes I feel
like this look is like a good luck you
to all the haters all the makeup haters
out there and all the exes out there and
goodbyes we are better with makeup yeah
today I just want to have some fun and
get crazy with color and darkness all
using this baby right here I am so
excited to share this with you if you
are a longtime follower of my channel or
on Instagram you know that this palette
right here is my holy grill writer diet
apologist has never let me down the
quality consistency and formula of
dubious place eye shadows are my
favorite they are magnificent so
yesterday dubious place came out with a
brand spanking new eyeshadow palette oh
it could me for a partner where you got
this and I just felt like I had to do a
tutorial focusing on this pal right here
just to get the mood of this video
started this gold here goes for there's
this pinky cranberry color here and goes
for day I just think you need some Juvia
up in your life should like brighten
everything up especially around
Valentine's Day it's just time to play
with makeup forget about boyfriends
forget about girlfriends forget about
anything dramatic and let's put the
drama on our face alright so furthest
and hi Valentine's Day makeup look you
want to look as sexy as hot as makeup
licious as you can baby
so I already went in prior to filming
this video would be milk what is this
called cooling water stick and I have
had this right underneath my eyes too
deep puffs and cool next time I go in
with this NYX CC cream and the color
color correcting it's the green one
this is for a light to medium skin tones
and I do this to kind of take care of
the redness on my cheeks
Shen's it's got recommended to me by
some scholar so I bought it while I was
in the state to finally try it out so
let's see what oh my gosh the green
transforms into a skin color that kind
of absorbs into the skin and takes away
through the redness hmm so I like how
this is not just a plain green to the
skin usually with like green primers I'm
like yeah but you're putting green on
your skin and that's gonna make it look
ashy and dull for my under eyes I'm
first gonna go in now with the pure
identity luxe firming eye cream and I
saw this over at Mac Daddy's snapchat
and I love putting this on right before
our foundation and concealer and it just
deep Huff's and pulls my under eye area
dramatically less I feel like concealer
blends in with it so nicely like
concealer looks so beautiful
on top of this I've been really really
loving this stuff it's amazing for a
foundation today I'm going to try a
brand new one I've never typed this
before this is by NARS it's the sheer
glow in the color Siberia
hello coverage good morning holy
whoa don't be fooled by the name of this
I thought sheer glow so I thought it was
going to be a more sheer finish
foundation wrong that I mind though I
love my coverage I love a pancake for
concealers heart-shaped cake
and now setting my face to make sure my
face lasts all day yes let me get your
inner Patrick Starr this right here is a
primer that I will not name it is the
primer that will not be named all right
so let's go into the Saharan pellet
Baiju vias place and I'm going to go in
with the color Kathina I'm going to blow
up this color in the crease from left to
right and up and down and that's what
she said make sure you go all the way up
to your inner crease all the way to that
bridge of your nose and smoke and haze
this out don't be afraid to blend this
bad boy out now I'm going to go into
Jamila and deepen and warm up that
crease even more and I'm focusing this
mainly in the crease but also making
sure I really blow and haze it out and
now going in with so Kodo to make it
brighter and more vampy for the little
go go in with one of my favorite shapes
out of the entire palette called a full
up and just Pat this from lashline to
crease
and putting a little bit of burl on the
outer lid going in with this laura
geller highlighter in charming pink for
the brow bone for the waterline and now
going in with this hue a slim cream
eyeliner in black one of the best
eyeliner for the waterline out there and
baby make that waterline vengeance city
honey
now with the black shadow from the
palette I'm going to smoke that out and
it get really grungy now mixing tag
which is the black and Jamila and smokin
this on the outer corner of the lower
lash line now go ahead and take the coat
oh that iconic coral red color and smoke
out that lower lash line even more and
to give that inner corner a pop and
adding burrow and as a finishing touch
highlighting my inner corner using that
laura geller highlighter again
For Lashes today I will be using my
current favorites
Lily lashes lush
all right it's time for teeth it's time
to show these bitches what the missing
out on no but honestly I am living
living for these eyes so I'm going to
keep up the game with my cheeks I'm
going to go in with this little bad boy
right here because I haven't been using
this in a hot minute
this is chemic wand medium sculpting
powder this bowl forever and always be
one of my all-time favorites is so good
and what else is really good is this
brush to contour with I am so glad that
I finally trusted the people and tried
out this technique because it is
honestly it has changed my contour game
for the good
all right now for blush I want to keep
it more on the you know pale vamp
Eastside but I also kind of really want
to wear blush I never go in with
dandelion blush by benefit and this
brush right here we're just giving
ourselves a little bit of blossom and
honey this blush smells good it smells
like a spring day up in here and to
stand the theme of this like beautifully
pinky highlight we got going on I'm
gonna go back into that laura geller
highlighter I've been obsessed with this
and this
Oprah fan brush and I'm going to dunk my
brush up because baby the glow is here
to guide you Oh
who gave Lord Gaylord the right to buy
like this
alright now I'm going to set my face
using the Milani make it last spray and
right before the spray has sex I go in
with a little bit more highlighter
because I want to blind butte ators out
there alright for us today the choice is
absolutely up to you you can literally
do whatever you want with the lips I am
personally going to go with a dark dark
almost black red originally I wanted to
go for black but I kind of feel like
that's going to scare people away and
since my face in general kind of scares
people away already I kind of wanted to
do a softer so I went for a red black
instead of a regular black kind of a go
in with just Oprah liquid lipstick in
the colour Harlem a certain someone is
looking like the Grinch again and by the
power of a wig

red grungy smokey eyes and dark vampy
