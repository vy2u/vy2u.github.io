August hit synagogue nose I feel like
August raced by throughout the month of
August I gathered up a lot of cool
favorite new products and I can't wait
to show them to you having a god know
for you I'm wearing glitter on my eyes I
feel like the typical drag Niki like I
always look like recently I got a common
saying girl all you do is drag you look
like a drag queen and I went thank you
thank you they're fabulous so what is
your point exactly alright so with that
any further ado let's hop a ride into my
heads of the month
okay bike no not by we're just starting
alright the first product I want to talk
about is a concealer this concealer has
changed my DNA it has changed my way of
living the tart shaped tape concealer is
AA pretty much ever since I started
using it I haven't touched any other
concealers out there it is super full
coverage but the thing is it is full
coverage but it doesn't make you look
like a drag queen it is full coverage it
will cover up anything but it doesn't
make you look fake you know what I mean
and it just makes it look like face
tuned perfected skin it's it's just
everything what you offer any concealer
it smells like a floral dream you only
need the tiniest bit even though I
ignore that I use a lot but this
concealer is literally the concealer of
my life right now
to stay in the skin lane I really want
to talk about the Giorgio Armani
luminous silk foundation powder this
stuff has been so amazing to set my
foundation and just my entire face with
I bought this last time when I was in LA
and I haven't used any other powder ever
since you can see how much damage I've
done to it already this just sets your
base really so incredibly it just makes
it look flawless it helped a little bit
with coverage just a tiny bit but in a
very luminous and natural way so it does
have coverage it does have a little bit
of color but it's very luminous very
soft it keeps you matte it keeps you
looking flawless it's all I want from a
face powder
it is so good and it's an all-time
favorite I got it next up I want to talk
about a palette that I've been wanting
to talk on my youtube channel for for
forever now I always rave about it on my
snap I've done numerous snapchat
tutorials with this talking about the
jus vias place anubian eyeshadow palette
this is a nude lover's dream it is such
a gorgeous neutrals palette with a lot
of warm neutrals a lot of coppers some
shimmer some dark colors it is it makes
my heart race it I love this so much now
what I love most about this is that it
is super affordable but the pigment in
this palette I do think Juvia splays eye
shadows are one of the top eye shadows
out there let me do one swatch watch
this copper right here I'm going to do
one swipe one swipe BAM let's do one of
the mattes this brown one swipe bam
these are so kin pigmented it just blows
my mind every time I play with them they
don't have Fallout they don't have kick
up in the palette itself it has a
beautiful range of shimmers super
shimmers mattes darks mediums warms
honestly I am so impressed and obsessed
with this palette and I've been talking
about this on snapchat for quite some
time never introduced it on my channel
here but let me tell you this is so
affordable you will never want any other
neutral shadow palette out there once
you have this and the 3500 by moorthi
speaking of Juvia splays they also
recently came out with a limited edition
masquerade eyeshadow palette now this
may be it looks like this it is abused
it is loved pretty much this entire
division right here is oh I love it so
much it's warm its rich its pigmented
these shimmery shadows right here this
one right here is called Giza I love
this to highlight my skin with it is
like a highlighted dream and I love that
it has your warm super-rich neutrals but
also a lot of pops of colors this
palette is so unique so pigmented so
good quality and again affordable they
have another palpable these two
especially really do it for me
and I love seeing Jaclyn talking about
them I love seeing more and more
youtubers talking about them it is
insane I do have a discount code for you
on these products right here they are
mega affordable but if you use code
Nikki at check out over at Juvia
space.com you will get even more
discount which will make them even more
affordable
the next product I want to talk about is
by Tom Ford this is the eye defining pen
in deeper no shame in my game
I got this because of totty gland I brew
here on YouTube she she sold me on this
and I totally get why she is like raving
about it so this right here is an
eyeliner pen and it has two sides one
side is like your typical like Kat Von D
brush tip applicator it's a brush it's
not a felt tip it's it's brush and then
when you flip it over on the other side
you have a felt tip really precise small
tiny precise brush now I feel like I
have tried every liquid liner Under the
Sun because I'm a liquid liner hooker
you know I live for my winged liner I
love that little flick and by little I
mean excessively dramatic and long but I
just love good flick so I feel like I've
used every liquid liner out there it all
started off with the tattoo liner then I
made my way to the punk or rock on liner
by RTC n I had the Kevin a Kwan one that
I really liked but they all had one
issue what just one issue on my inner
corners whenever I would apply eyeliner
there it would start to bleed and go all
over the place I worked so hard on a
clean defined flick of an eye liner and
then on the inner corners just right at
the inner corners of my eyes that will
bleed and it will go all bumpy not bumpy
just watery just what it would go
everywhere and I noticed it especially
with the Kat Von D tattoo liner just
those inner court I would have good days
where it would just stay in place and it
looked like just a magical line but on
my usual days it would just bleed on
that inner corner and my inner corner
only of the rest of it perfection inner
corner mess this is the very first
eyeliner in my whole goddamn life
that
not bleed on the inner corners I feel
like a brand-new person I feel so
complete I feel like I this is what it
feels like this eyeliner is expensive
but so worth it
another eyeliner I've been loving and
this is not for like everyday wear
but the NYX vivid brights eyeliners are
so cool they come in a bunch of really
bright almost neon looking colors and my
favorite out of the bunch is the pink
the pink one is called
vivid petal and I love this as an accent
liner I will do my black wing and then
kind of surrounded with the pink or
whichever color you like and it's just
my favorite way of adding color into a
very neutral look I think the
consistency and formula on these are
super great they are matte they are
super duper rich in color and they just
they're very easy to work with I love
them I love something colorful I love
that they come in a bunch of colors plus
NYX is super affordable so these get an
absolute thumbs-up from me who else have
we talked about these in my channel
these are the touch insole metallus
liquid foil and glitter shadow duo
what these are one side of them is a
metallic liquid foil cream eyeshadow and
the other side is like a glitter pigment
so one side has a doe foot applicator
just like that just like any other like
creamish like creamish eyeshadow out
there but it's a foil and so you spread
that all over your lid and then to make
it so much better like so much better
you have the glittery pigment sort of
topper which is applied with a very
different applicator this is like a
plasticy hard flexible plastic and this
will really stamp it on there in that
cream and it's just blinding I love
anything glittering shimmering blinking
I love anything that has a sparkle so
I'm a huge fan of these I did find that
the foil I should have said the cream
eyeshadow side will crease if I don't
put a base underneath but I already do
that everyday so I'm good with that so
these are
captial they are out of this world oh my
god a brush i have loved for the last
month is urban decay came out with new
brushes and they came out with the urban
decay smoky smudger e to o8 brush this
brush right here is so good for the
lower lashline like i will use this to
apply my lower lash line colors and it
will just apply them so rich and
pigmented and they're there like with a
lot of lower lash line brushes or like
pencil brushes are like smudger brush
ism like okay cool but where's my
pigment not with this brush this brush
picks up that powder picks up that
shadow it just distributes it onto your
eyes and it's so rich pigmented and
there and it's so easy to work with so
it gives you maximum payoff of the
pigment in the shadow or whatever you're
using and then it also has the ability
to blend and do magical stuff to your
eyes this is currently my favorite lower
lashline shadow applicator it's bomb I
have recently switched lash glues
because before I would always use the
House of lashes eyelash glue but my
problem with that is it will stay on
forever the problem is once you take the
lashes off I feel like there's like
little bits and pieces of glue on your
lash line and even in your natural
lashes and it's always such a bitch to
get it off I use my most hardcore eye
makeup remover to get the glue off with
and even then sometimes it will just
stay there and it's so annoying
and so I've dealt with that for like a
year and after a year I had enough I
need an eyelash glue that has the same
like staying power but is it's not gonna
stay with me until I die so I found
exactly that in the Escudo companion
long lasting bond that's a very rich way
of staying eyelash glue yeah it's just
been an amazing eyelash glue it keeps my
lashes on through thick and thin but it
doesn't stay with me once I want it gone
so it's a really really nice eyelash
glue it doesn't have a weird scent not
that I can remember okay it does have a
little bit of a scent it's nothing
do Oh do was do was like Satan himself I
don't get people who still used you on
like how do you do it so a sceeto
companion long-lasting bond is amazing a
highlighter I've been dying over is by
Oprah
now Oprah is known for their amazing
liquid lipsticks but they also make like
high key really impressive highlighters
out there this is one of them this is
Beverly Hills and it is a wheel of
highlighters it comes with five colors
now this color army would be a beautiful
eye shadow this is a little bit more of
a blush but this side right here is
where it's at for me right now what I'll
do is dip my highlighter brush in this
side right here can swirl it around or
when I'm feeling like really blinding
which is always I go for the white only
it's just such a out-there blinding
highlighter that will catch your like a
lighthouse you are like a walking
lighthouse I love the consistency and
feel of the powder they're really soft
and they don't need a lot of work to be
blended into the skin I'm wearing the
white and the champagne ash one mixed
together on my cheeks and nose right now
as a highlight and it's just it's so
beautiful it is so beautiful the texture
and feel of the powder is really soft
really buttery really pigmented it is it
is such a good highlighter if you're
darker skinned you can go for the copper
and the more peachy one it's for medium
you can mix if you're light you can take
the white it's like such a universal
friendly highlighter it's really really
nice I think that's all I have to talk
about today I think we've made our way
through all the love and Lake positivity
and it's just time to get back to
reality and show you a product that
really didn't do it for me this month oh
yeah
no my oh god no this month
sadly comes from Smashbox before I say
anything they're liquid lipsticks are so
crazy insanely good so I figured that
most of their like lip stuff is really
good I love their classic lipsticks with
like the matte finish so when I saw that
they came out with the instant matte mmm
lipstick transformer I got so excited
basically what this promises to do is
transform any creamy shiny lip into a
matte lip because it's an instant Matt
lipstick transformer so I put on a
creamy lipstick I put this over top and
it just made it look like this weird
substance of wax it's like you put a
classic creamy lipstick on and put like
a silicone e face primer over top it's
just basically what it feels like you
know those really silicone II like
slippery face primers that you can use
to fill up your pores with and just
smooth it all out it kind of felt like
that on the lips and it just it
gunked-up on the inner rim of my lips it
just made the lipstick formula really
odd and it just didn't sit well my lips
plus it it just went everywhere it gave
it this like fogged glass so waxy finish
it just completely disappointed me
because I wanted something to really
give me that nice luxurious matte feel
but it gave me waxy fogged glass now see
this
so I'm sorry Smashbox but no and that's
it guys that that were all my hits and a
