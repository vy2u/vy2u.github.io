tutorial on Adele and she's pretty big
here in the Nolan's I love that she
isn't like the skinniest of them all
she's just she has like a voice and
she's here to like show her voice and
it's what I love about her she doesn't
care that she's a bigger girl like us
like me
I tried to do my hair all Adele ish and
yes so today I'm going to show you how
to do this Adele inspired look I was
mainly inspired by this look that is on
my website at nikkietutorials like hum
and we're using all Mac's today just
because I got asked by some viewers to
do more Mac so yeah thank you guys so
much for watching and if you want to
know how I did this then please stay
tuned so like every video I'm starting
it with applying a base to my lids to
prepare my eye shadow from creasing and
I'm using my BH Cosmetics I own lip
primer sure laughs OH
so the first color going to take is mex
expensive pink and I'm using a 239 for
that and just Pat this onto the lid now
for the crease I'm going to use quark
from Mac start going into the crease
with quark and go as far as you like and
because you guys asked me to not go into
the nose for once I'm not going to for
today so just blend that into the crease
and then go as far up as you like then
I'm going to take a 217 and blend it
then I'm going to take Max twinks and
I'm just going to go over that for a
little bit of Sheen in the crease um I
didn't want to make it too
ah Matt so that's why I'm ending the
twigs to it for some Zima
for the brow bone highlight I'm just
going to say some white frost eyeshadow
from Mecca and first place it on the
highest point of your arch like that
then take a little bit more and wipe the
brush off completely and blended so you
get a really minimum Sheen but it's a
shame that you will notice anyways this
is fascinating so first just put that
onto the waterline
now I'm going to use my lighter and make
it um kind of molten then just dab it a
little bit onto the lower lash line so
you get product on it like that then
just take your brush and make that shape
into it okay now I'm going to make this
brush wet and put solo right on top of
that white to give that gold Sheen then
to give the lower lashline a little bit
more dimension I'm going to take twinks
again and put that on the inner corner
of the lower lash line so here that
point then for the eyeliner I'm just
going to take the mech eyeliner that
looks like that with the point like that
go first
follow the direction of the white line
okay and then from that outer corner of
that black line go all the way in to
your inner corner
okay I'm not gonna curl my lashes and
apply some mascara and then I will be
back for the lashes so four lashes I'm
just using some duo lash adhesive in
clear and the lashes I'm using I
actually got at IMATS and I believe
they're from Nigel's beauty Emporium and
I'm going to apply two on top of each
other the first one is number five to
three and that is right here I'm going
to put that on my eyes in the second and
on top of that is going number six oh
five six of five I definitely suggest
using false lashes because um
Adele definitely wears them by crazy a
lot of English girls love to wear their
fake eyelashes I love it I do it I just
look down into this model mirror and I
just looked down and I apply it right
above my lashes just put it on and let
it sit for a second so it can really
like cling onto your eyes okay then take
your tweezers if you like and put that
in a corner where it needs to be and put
that outer corner it needs to be and
then when you think it's like dry enough
you can pet it down so it's in the
perfect position I'm going to wait a
little longer because it's not dry yet
now I'm going to take the other lashes
just put some glue on to the band and
then just pop it right on top
and just do the same just let it sit
there for a second and then do your
thing okay you see that white that is a
glue and it will dry but I always like
to go over that eyeliner one more time
just to get the perfect flowy line of
the eyeliner and just to hide those
left's just even better so I'm just
going to take my eyeliner again and go
over it and then I will be back for the
lips then I'm going to take angel
lipstick from Mac which is almost going
to break and then the top of angel I'm
going to use this lip gloss from when a
woman in emancipation so that completes
this Adele inspired makeup tutorial um
it's inspired by that picture that is my
thumbnail and that is on my website into
tutorials com I'm also just kinda how
she always looked she always has those
like beautiful lashes beautiful eyeliner
just a little bit of shadow and accretes
some nice nudish rosy lips and that is
it so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
if you have any questions leave them in
the comment section below I love you and
um what is your favorite Adele song uh
mine definitely is someone like you it's
so beautiful it's it's amazing so I
think you guys so much for watching
again and I love you again and hopefully
I will see you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
