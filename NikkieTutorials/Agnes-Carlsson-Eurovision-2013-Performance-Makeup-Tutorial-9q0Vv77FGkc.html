tutorial on Edna's Carlsen at the
Eurovision semi-finals number two she
looked stunning and basically her
performance was so good I was like can't
she win
like for like Sweden again or something
and basically after a minute or so my
entire Twitter feed was bombarded with
requests for this look so here we am
recreating it and I of course look
nothing like her I wish I looked like
her but she's gorgeous and if you want
to know how to recreate this then please
keep on watching
so the first thing you want to do is
apply base to your eyelids 2% I should
have increasing and I'm using my soft
and soft soft and ochre yeah sure and
I'm using my soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac
the first I should I will be using is
embark by Mac and I'm going to run this
along my lower lash line now I'm gonna
take max eyes shadow in glimpse of flesh
and continue to finding the lower lash
line with this and blend it out with a
pencil brush to make it really nice and
smoky and blown out for my inner corner
highlight it will take a little bit of
Mac's golden mode pigment for the crease
I'm gonna take glimps of flesh again by
Mac and just start defining my crease
and what made this look so beautiful is
that it was a really really big brown
smokey eye so it was completely sort of
blown out and smoked out so what you
want to do with this crease is go up
until your brow bone taking nude on
board bronzer by Mac with this I'm going
to blow out and smoke out that crease
even more and don't be shy of going all
the way up that is what will make this
look so exotic and bronzy and beautiful
for the lid will be taking max wood wing
to eyeshadow and just apply that to the
inner third of the lid and then going on
top with a little bit of gold mode
pigment this is cork eyeshadow by Mac
and I'm applying that color to the
middle of my lid blending with wood
winged and gold mode okay taking
embarked again I'm going to connect my
outer part of my lower lash line to my
crease and now what you want to do is
really darken those outer corners using
embark and again don't be afraid to go
up this is a really big smokey eye
go big or go home baby hey taking that
bronzer again and going even
further up and making everything even
blender now we'll be taking this in glop
pigment in number 232 and apply this to
the lid as a pop of sparkle release the
glitter I'm gonna run a little bit of
black eyeshadow along my upper lash line
I'm sorry I had to think of that and
this will get the lash line a little bit
more definition because so much shiny
colors can really make your eyes look a
little bit sickish and when you give
your eyelash line a little bit more
definition it will look better to
highlight my inner corners I will be
using this Blanc type I shed up by Mac
okay I'm not gonna run some Ben 9
utilize your cream crayon in red
concealer number one mp3 along my
waterline that's what you call that line
and all you want to do for the eyes now
is apply some mascara
Agnes wasn't wearing any false lashes at
least not that I could see or notice on
her so umm mascara only and the mascara
so we'll be using art my makeup severe
what a pro 3dx or black and my benefit
they're real
okay so further chicks do you also
really want to go bronzy and summery and
just like like a bronze goddess I first
contoured my entire face with my NYX
blush in taupe just because I always use
it to contour myself and then I got a
new bronzer from MEC and I absolutely
love the packaging it is starting this
is the nude unboard pro longwear
bronzing powder by Mac and I used that
to bronze up my face for blush you want
to go for a sort of pinky neutral tone
because if you put like an orange gold
toned blush with this you would just
look like an orange Oompa Loompa goddess
not a bronze goddess but in bloom by
goddess so the blush I used is by Mac as
well and this is called pink tea and
then Ackman's
glowed like no other like her skin was
glowy as hell and it was gorgeous and
for that I suggest using Mac's vanilla
pigment
I did that as well over lips you want to
go with a really nice pill warm color
I'm first gonna completely bling my lips
out with what is left in my foundation
brush then i'm gonna take pure
decoration lipstick by Mac which is a
really nice sort of curly neutral color
and then Agnes was definitely rocking
some lip gloss and the lip gloss I will
be using is talk softly to me by Mac as
well and then everybody completes my
Agnes Carlson life at the Eurovision
2013 in Sweden performance inspired
makeup tutorial so that's it for this
