Great Wall of China
the world wonder but I also was inspired
by Amira and Amira
is this girl who sings the song but her
music video is so pretty because she has
pretty makeup on and pretty clothes and
she hasn't got any eyebrows but I love
her for doing that but in one scene she
wears like this red glittery makeup and
then clothes and and I was like wow
that's China that is China so I hope you
want to get um again if you have any
questions at the end of this video with
them in the comment section below I
loved these series and I loved doing
this for you guys and stick on to the
end because I have some info right there
that you cannot miss thanks for watching
guys bye
so the first thing you want to do for
this look is start off with the eyes
instead of the face why is because you
are going to get a lot of glitter on
your face and we don't want that
the first thing you want to do is grab a
dark brown eyeshadow I'm going to use
mix and mark and a stiff shade brush
away the Mac 239 I have to clean it I'm
so sorry
and what you're gonna do is was her name
Amira has her eyeshadow what kind of
pointed outwards and really hollow into
the nose so I'm gonna try to recreate
that and keep it in that Chinese style
so that's what we're gonna do
I take max which and this is going to be
your blending color above the end mark
now you're gonna take em X em bark again
an 82 17 and you're going to darken up
that outer wing you made right now it
looks like it is round but once they
apply foundation and all that stuff it
will be like that winged effect
now take max vanilla eyeshadow with HSM
be fine guys Sigma and this is going to
be your highlight and your highlight you
want that to be perfectly there next
step is to get stargazer a loose pigment
in number three and this is the rat one
and what I'm gonna do is Sigma 239 and
pack it all over that space that isn't
touched yet and you will be thinking
like a mere eyes all this glitter there
we are going to have that's here because
the right next to that we're going to
echo letter don't forget to first apply
some NYX jumbo pencil in milk
now you're going to take heavily
naturals
ruby slippers glitters this is a deep
red glitter and that is exactly what I
want I really recommend this glitter
because it's really pretty and exactly
the color we want what you now want to
do is get some lash glue and put it on a
q-tip and apply that to the lid and this
is going to act as your adhesive base
for your glitter
also trying not to rub the brush on tear
lit try to debit on to the list so don't
rub the glitter debit
so once you have the glitter on you're
going to take some tape and you're just
gonna um wait this is a big fail because
I'm coming all right of course you don't
want to look like the glitter putt
attacked you and you can escape so
you're going to take some tape and just
pull all these glitters away and as you
can see all the glitter goes on to that
tape and it should be super easy since
you don't have any foundation on you
because when you have a foundation on
with this it's gonna stick to it but you
don't so that's good it now it's time to
apply all your foundation blush contour
shade and all that good stuff and then
we're going to do the lower lid
now take max vanilla again and the
highlighter brush and start highlighting
the inner corners of your eye
now take max embark again and smudge
that all along the lower lid and connect
it with that outer ring right there
now if you want you can take some more
vanilla and make that shape or really
sharp as I said in the beginning you can
do this with your foundation I did that
a bit not as good as I wanted to so I'm
gonna make it perfect right now and I'm
gonna do is line my waterline and that
upper line right there in between and my
lash line I'm gonna use makeup for over
the black pencil for my waterline and
Lancome's art liner I cannot find it for
my upper leg from the upper lash line so
I will be right back
the last video I got to my we mean comes
like oh my god if you're so good at your
eyes and you want to learn stuff or
teach us stuff why don't you do
something different to your lips because
it's stupid
because because it's stupid that you
keep doing new lips you have to teach us
new things not old things because I'm
inspired by China and Amira I'm gonna
use new lips creme the nude Mac here you
go and this especially with a look like
this you wanna do it live because hello
and to top it off I'm going to use a
light pink gloss
this is max Viva Glam sticks I am in
love with that color</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
