first of all let's take a moment to UM
look at my new hair I'm a pinky now I
feel like Katy Perry Lady Gaga and me so
yesterday I went to my hairstylist and
um I just wanted some change I took a
little bit off my very very dead ends
because they really they had to go
because they were just kind of hanging
there sort of like what are we doing
here so yeah my hairstylist cut my dead
ends and then we decided to go for a
pink color and I really really like it
it's it's sort of like a mixture of like
Ally lucky and soft old sort of Frankie
and I really really like it it's
definitely I have to get used to it
because when I wake up I see like pink
strands of hair around my face and look
up so yeah I have pink hair now and I'm
really happy with it what's happening
with my voice so that number one that's
my first haul my new hair a couple of
days ago I went to Amsterdam with my mom
and my brother and of course
first things first were Mac and other
makeup stores for me okay so the first
things I got at Mac are the face and
body foundations and these are just
refills because I use face and body
foundation on my models on truths
because it doesn't reflect light because
there's no SPF in this and also I just
really like it because you can really
build it up and when it dries it's
really waterproof basically the only
foundation that I carry on two shoots
are my face and bodies and I love these
and the ones I got are white because
that's always nice to make a color
lighter and I use this for myself as
well then I got these c3 and I got c7
then I also got a new contouring powder
this is taupe by Mac and they only carry
this at the pro stores the shape and
highlight contour and highlight powders
and before I go on with my story I also
got my NYX blush in taupe umm someone on
Twitter told me that they were going to
discontinue my holy grill shaping
contouring powder by NYX called taupe
and when I read that tweet I kinda
my heart broke I went into a mild
depression I couldn't speak for a day
life stopped so I went to the MEK store
and I bought the Mac taupe blush because
I felt like what taupe and taupe is
taupe I went ahead and that night the
same night as when I bought the Mac
blush I did a blog post review on the
Mac blush in the NYX blush comparing the
two and if it would compare to my Holy
Grail NYX blush so I did a full blog
post on that and you can find the link
in the infobox below if you want to see
that buy with this huge blog post on how
like sort of heartbroken I was and I had
to find a new do for this and then NYX
tweeted me like no need to sob because
we're not going to discontinue it that
was a day that my life started living
again well so for anyone who's thinking
that NYX is gonna discontinue their
taupe blush they're not another one of
those sad stories is that um I think the
same day people told me like well Nick
they're discontinued kid eyes shadow by
Mac there was another hour that my life
decided to not live any longer kid eyes
shadow is one of my all-time favorite
sort of blending colors this is kid I
kid
it's perfect for light skin ladies like
me and you can really blend out your
crease or if you just want a really tiny
bit of shadow your lash line kid is
perfect for that I don't know if Mac is
going through with this but I got a
backup of kid eyes shadow because Mac
how Kenya they discontinued all the good
stuff it's like Mac has like we have
this entire collection good and bad
let's discontinue the good and keep the
bed then the next thing I bought was
this Mac reflex in gold and this is
perfect for if you want to like sort of
a really wearable glittery finish all
over your wherever you want to put it
this is just sort of like a really
finely milled gold reflect this entire
haul basically is back up because either
the Bren is discontinuing it or I'm out
of it basic oh crap no
Falls so another backup is my favorite
long-lasting concealer this is the mac
prolongwear concealer in NC 15 and I put
that under my eyes and sort of like in a
highlighting shape all over my face to
highlight I love this concealer because
it's is really pigmented and it stays on
the entire day like really it stays on
the entire day and I love this another
backup is my Mac blacktrack fluid line I
use this all the time for eyeliners for
for anything that needs a black line
basically and I love my black art fluid
line so I got a refill I got the new Mac
mascara in I don't know what this is
called and I also got this Estee Lauder
a pure color lipstick in rebel raspberry
and this is stunning
this is like a dark red with glitter and
shine and it's so so stunning and um I
made pictures for a full blog post
review on this one so check out my blog
nikkietutorials calm in the next few
days I will have a full blog post review
on this this is gorgeous another
lipstick that I got is by Burberry
and this is this is called number 28
davonne sunset I'm not sure if that's
supposed to be like the Burberry way of
saying divine sunset but this says divan
sunset this is a stunning sort of muted
peachy color oh I forgot two other Mac
things these are the mineralized
skinfinish --is from their new apprec
k-- that name is just such a know they
have the oh so fantastic syria rose
everyone is talking about this and they
have porcelain pink and I am wearing
both like Syria Rose is right here on my
cheek and um porcelain pink is on my
highlighting spots of my face and I
really like it it gives you a really
sort of healthy glowy skin and
little bit of color because of Serio
rose I love these these are amazing they
were sold out everywhere from OPI I did
a couple of weeks ago I did a full blog
post review on the new OPI mariah carey
collection and i got to you of the
liquid sand polishes that I didn't have
yet this is get your number and that is
a blue sort of with a 3d glitter and
then I also gotten this one I want at
the most because this is stay the night
and this is a sort of black with red and
magenta glitters if you don't know what
the liquid sands are by OPI these are
polishes that dry like sand so they get
a really gritty sort of dry finish and I
love that the last thing I want to show
you is I went to River Island and I got
a couple of clothes this ear piece right
here you stick it let me demonstrate
you're sick it like right behind this
was a lot easier off-camera oh god damn
and they just sort of gothe behind your
ear like that so this is really awesome
for if you have your hair up in a really
high bun or in a really tight sort of
ponytail I love this um I don't know how
this is gonna hurt me throughout the day
I just broke it
are you kidding me I just oh it was so
pretty
no I ruined it again I try to sort of
like make it a little bit wider because
my ear so damn big and then I broke it
sometimes I just want to punch myself in
the face
