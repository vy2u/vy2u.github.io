here with a hull I have um a couple of
days ago I met the amazing so Coulomb
Heather from her channel so Coulomb and
then a couple of numbers she's actually
one of the few years University where I
absolutely love and whenever they upload
a video I get crazy
so me and Heather went to Amsterdam and
we have so much fun every bad but before
we went to Amsterdam Heather was so kind
enough to gift me some products from
Canada or actually from the US because
she went to the u.s. first so the first
thing I got from Heather was my favorite
toothpaste out of the u.s. this is crest
3d white vivid toothpaste I swear by
this stuff I found out about this about
two years ago when I first went to New
York and I am in love ever since since
she also got me for wet and wild
lipsticks and we used to have wet and
wild here in Holland but they
discontinued the entire brand which was
like a knife through my heart and she
got me some amazing colors I absolutely
love them
she gave me number 908 C which is a
really nice dark berry color and these
are really matte and I love matte
lipsticks because I just love the finish
of something mat that she also gave me
ninety one ninety which is a dark dark
purple it kind of reminds me of rebel by
Mac then she also gave me a hot hot
paint this is a dull house pink I went
and wild as well I loved it
and now less than at least she gave me a
think pink lipstick as well and I love
that color she also gave me dream Lumi
touch highlighting concealer by
Maybelline and this is the pinky sort of
salmon shade kind of brightens up your
under eye area and you can highlight
your face with this and I I just really
really like it I even like for my lips
as well my trusty old Neutrogena Healthy
Skin Foundation love love love this I
always use it be out of the door top
coat for your nails we don't have that
here in Holland and this is seriously
the best topcoat ever so she gave me
this all on the train
to answer them and then once we arrived
in Amsterdam we got some great products
we went to Mac we went to River Island
loved that Sora we went to Sasha we went
to so many fun stores and that yeah
ethnic I got this sponge just for a
foundation and stuff it's not really
that important and then also from the
nine till five work collection what's up
with that name they have beautiful
prolongwear stuff and they have this
eyeshadow in uninterrupted and it's a
prolong wear eye shadow love this I love
love love ochre toned shadows because I
feel like um when you when you wear a
sort of ochre yellow toned shade around
your crease or under your eyes it makes
you look so fashionable and I'm wearing
it today
of course Brown is wearable and stuff
but with like an ochre touch to it you
become so much more like it like it's
it's just not like it's the clown but
like a girl or a boy it she he did she
it's really pro longwear because i
swatch it on my hand and when we went
back home it was still on and I loved it
it's gorgeous and I highly recommend it
then I also got the alum comb Hypnose
mascara and waterproof I always use
waterproof because my lashes are a
nightmare and I find that they only hold
my curl when I use a waterproof mascara
I'm gonna include some products now that
I ordered on the internet before but I
still want to include them in this video
one of them being the Laura Mercier
secret camouflage concealers you know it
I love Lisa Eldridge she is my favorite
youtuber here on YouTube she uses these
all the time so I'm just like if she
loves them I might love them so I
ordered number one and number two and so
far it really covers up really well but
I'm gonna be really honest I still like
my OCC concealer better now um I don't
know maybe this still has to grow on me
or I have to use it a bit more but so
far is really really good but my Oct
concealer is a little
be better then from nars I order two
blushes this is luster which is a
beautiful sort of shining peach neutral
color
it's a peachy neutral color with a lot
of gold shine in it and then I also got
Jena which is a sort of brighter curly
peachy neutral color and it will make
you look like a clown if you use too
much so be careful with this one but I'm
actually wearing the two together on my
face today and I love these then I also
got Lady Gaga's of Fame perfume I
already tweeted and Instagram this but I
I'm seriously obsessed with this just
look at it it's like I love the bottle I
love everything about it
it is so unique so gorgeous and I love
that the liquid is black but once you
spray it on you can't see it anymore so
it's kind of like when it touches the
air it becomes translucent parent you
can actually hold it like that on your
table like a dragon egg with dark fluids
in it then some of you might know this
but if you follow me on Twitter I have
been telling you guys that I am now a
teacher at B Academy yes the school
where I learned everything from Pascal
to Sir she taught me everything and now
I am a teacher along with her so we're
sort of like two teachers two two
classes
it's insane I'm teaching at the school
where I learned everything now and on
Monday we have one student who is like
seriously she's my jewelry queen now and
it's like every week when she walks in
I'm like oh what's she wearing now she
was wearing these triangle rose gold
earrings and it's from H&amp;amp;M and this is a
divided by H&amp;amp;M packed with like six
pairs of earrings with like all these
funny shapes and stuff I love this then
last but not least is a river island one
of my most favorite stores ever um I
went pretty well out there
I went pretty and thing over there one
of them is this sweater and funny is
like three girls in a store were wearing
I saw them walking mind I was ago yeah
Oh thought I asked him like where is his
Twitter promised it from this story if
so I need it like right now so she text
and she said it wasn't coming until
Thursday we were there at Tuesday so I
was like totally depressed and I
couldn't get the sweater and then I
bought some other stuff but then I
actually had to go back to River Island
because they didn't take one of the
alarm things off I did not seal it let
me assure you I did not feel it they
just forgot to take the alarm thing off
what do you think that caught my eye
first when I walked back in yes the
sweater I was like this bitch and
literally it was like a way for like two
hours you couldn't tell me that you were
hanging it right there in two hours
I got the sweater super happy with it
it's I'm gonna stand up for you it's a
really glittery sweater and I absolutely
love love love it even like that
glittery and I love it okay so this is
the second shirt it's a really glittery
black with silver shirt and the back is
a little bit longer can you see that
like it's soft right here in the front
and then in the back it goes a little
bit more down and then over here we got
this sort of dress that it looks studded
but it's actually not it's just the
fabric and I love this I think it's just
a perfect length for my body and I
really really love this it's so festive
and happy shiny okay then I also got
this belt this super cute belt I love it
I love belts I also got these lashes
they actually have lashes at river
island these are these shimmer twins
treasure lashes and they are crazy they
were priced crazy these are 17 euros so
a mom and her two kids saw these lashes
and I was paying them and the mom went
like who the hell wears this stuff and I
looked at her and I was like me but
that's it that's my haul with so Coulomb
so Coulomb I love you Heather I had so
much fun and
I can't wait for another shopping spree
