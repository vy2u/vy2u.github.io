tutorial on this um I've nobody what I'm
gonna call this yet I wanted to look
like this angelic sort of girly girl
with a pop of periwinkle and I find this
to be very wearable for like a party for
like your birthday party for like a
festival because it got that sparkle
before I start the tutorial I want to
mention that I am filming this with a
brand spanking new camera this is the
Canon 70d I went from the 600d to this
Stefanie D and this is my first time
filming with it
so I do want to apologize in advance if
some of the camera work is off so maybe
the white balance is a little bit off or
maybe the focusing is a little bit off
because this is autofocus and everything
and it's just a journey that we have to
go through together I am really happy to
have my 70d though because I actually
have more ISO and more lighting and
temperature settings
I think 70% of you right now I think
what what are you talking about just get
to the gif tutorial girl I do want to
apologize in advance if some things are
a little bit off but I'm working on it
and other than dads if you want to know
how to get this look right here or mama
and please keep watching alright so the
first thing we're gonna do is spread my
face and for this I'm gonna use
something new I don't have it in its
full packaging because I tried a sample
I got a sample what's inside of this
little pot right here is Chanel's
Leblanc
it's like globe long serum it's part of
their makeup line so that is what I'm
gonna apply to my face to date as a
serum dipping my finger in I tried this
in the store and it's felt and smelled
amazing dinner try it on my face though
feels very moisturizing / thick but not
like cake itch it's not like oh my god
my skin can't breathe for foundation
today I'll be using my Revlon Colorstay
in we're in 110 ivory I find to keep my
channel new
and improving and and you know daring
and new I like to switch my foundations
up a little bit so today I am going for
the Revlon Colorstay and I'll be
applying that with my makeup geek
stippling foundation brush I totally
forgot how much coverage is that boy has
oh my god goes to show that makeup
reference really changed by age because
I used to obsess over this when I was
younger and right now after not using it
for a couple of years and going back to
it for this video I kind of feel like
holy where did I need that coverage
for her so as usual for concealer I'm
gonna go with my Mac Pro Longwear in
nc15 and of course my Mac prep and prime
highlighter in Radium rose and I'm gonna
buff that in using my sigma tapered
kabuki and SAT six
I feel loving this technique
okay so now that I've got that all
blended in I'm now just gonna do my
brows that in one I off camera and then
we'll be back so the first thing we're
gonna do for eyes this apply a base to
prevent the eyeshadows from creasing and
I use my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot for
the halt my first eyeshadow is gonna
come from the Sigma smokescreen palette
this one right here and I'll be using
this color right here and this is called
haze and what I gonna do is take a big
blending brush
this is DS dewey fat 228 crease brush
and what I'm gonna do is flick this into
my crease
there's not really a technique going on
here I'm just blending it in
and as I blend that in I like to take it
up a little bit higher and just give
that a really smooth edge gonna take
that same color and run it underneath
and also gonna let them meet up here
right on the outer edge going back into
the Sigma smokescreen palette taking
this color right here this is called
rave and that collar is going all over
the lid blending into the crease once
that is one there then I'm gonna go into
this amazing chanel product and this is
a stylo eyeshadow in number seven Moon
River and it's quite an unusual product
because it feels cooling and wet once
you apply it so I'm gonna take that
stylo eye shadow and place it all over
my lid meeting up to the crease and then
quickly with my finger I'm gonna Pat it
in and again while I'm at it I'm also
gonna run this on the bottom and again
quickly with my finger blending that in
for a pop of color on the inner part of
my crease going back to that smokescreen
palette again and taking this color
right here this is Missy which is a
really nice pastel e lavender I'm just
taking the slightest bit of that and
running this on the inner part of my
crease and that gives it a really
light light lucky touch for some extra
pizzazz and sparkle I'm gonna go into
this Catrice iridescent topper this is a
liquid glitter sort of like the lorac 3d
glitter that one so I'm gonna take a
little bit of that and first run this on
top of my lid and that will really tie
these sort of musky brownie shades
together with the like like a shade and
then taking a little bit more and
applying this on my inner corners and
bottom lashline for some extra extra
sparkly nuts on D waterline I'm gonna
take this essence what is it called big
bright eyes i penciled to open up along
the waterline and then finally for the
star of this video the eye liner the pop
of periwinkle I'm gonna go into my Stila
stay all day waterproof a liquid pen and
this is called periwinkle and I'm just
gonna apply a very simple line with this
I'm not gonna wing it just a thicker
solid periwinkle line it does need a
couple of layers to become really bright
and intense that's okay so I'm just
adding my first layer now and then
letting it dry for a bit and then adding
my second layer okay now it's time for
mascara and lashes and because I want
this look to be a little bit more
romantic and lashy I'm gonna go for fall
season a lot of mascara on top and
bottom so for the top lashes I'll be
using my makeup studio one for 3d in
extra black and for my bottom lashes I'm
gonna go with my Mac extended play
gigablack lash and for falsies I'm gonna
take yet another pair of my 10x oxo
Beauty false lashes and these are the
romantic and they are so pretty
I can't wait well I'm actually wearing
it already but I can't wait to have it
on both of my eyes all right so once
we've got our Basin
done it's time for the cheeks I am NOT
gonna go too far with the cheeks I am
however as always first gonna contour
and here comes the shock I am using my
NYX taupe blush and boys as baby
gorgeous I do not know why didn't use
you for so long I do want to warm my
face up a little bit more because I feel
very very pill right now I'll be using
the bourgeois bronzer chocolate bronzer
and this is number 51 and just kind of
you know you should on your cheeks it's
actually a really good joob for disobey
for blush I'm gonna go for a really soft
purple lilac and this is max chakra
brushing that onto the apples somewhat
more to the back and then coming forward
on to the actual actual actual Apple
Jesus and then to give myself that
beautiful angelic glow of course I need
my vanilla pigment by Mac so I'm going
to dust it all over the highest points
of my face you know what I'm gonna go
for some glow up in here I'm basically
gonna let my face take a bath in dis so
for lips the first thing I'm gonna do is
align them and give them a little bit
more Juche using my Bobbi Brown lip
pencil in pale pink
the fur lipstick I thought it would be
nice to also go back to an old favorite
this is pure Zen by Mac and I'm just
gonna put this all over and I don't want
to get that a little bit more of a
peachy tarts so I'm gonna take my
Illamasqua cream pigment in emerg I'm
gonna take a bit and tap it on top and
firm a gloss today I'll be using another
NYX butter gloss and this is Eclair and
