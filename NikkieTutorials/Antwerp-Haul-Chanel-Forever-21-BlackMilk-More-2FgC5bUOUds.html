and I haven't done a haul in so long I
think my last haul was when I still had
like past Sally pinky purple Eli like he
hair so that's like ages ago so last
week I went shopping with my best friend
in a Java which is a Dutch city I live
nearby and then the day after that I
went to Antwerp with my boyfriend
and I bought lots and lots of things and
I ordered stuff and it got stuff from PR
agencies and everything so today I'm
here to share everything with you that
the fun times begin so the first thing I
got is by benefit and this is the
world-famous neutrals palette and i got
this from benefits PR i'm gonna do a
full blog post review on this i think
that is gonna be up this week or next
week and this is the palette it is
stunningly gorgeous i love the packaging
and then when you open it you have four
colors and two creaseless cream shadows
and then in the lid they show you how to
do is there only one look
oh they show you two looks with a mirror
I didn't even know that it has four
amazing neutral colors I'm wearing this
color right here which is called it's
complicated I'm wearing that one on my
lid and I love it and it's a really cute
palette and I love the packaging and
it's good for everyday use then I got
two liquid eyeliners bicolor star and
these are number 25 which is called Oro
Matano and i have number 26 which is
called Oro glitter so I have a gold
glitter liner which is a little bit more
opaque than like like a regular like
glitter liner and then I have a bronze
one which I'm wearing on my lash line
right now and I love that it just gives
you that sort of definition and shine
but not like an eyeliner eyeliner
feeling so it's sort of like a nice sort
of touch of bronze I got three
development and nail polishes because I
loved were Lippman the only thing I did
not love is the price tag because oh my
gosh they're expensive but in Belgium
Antwerp they were a little bit more
cheap so
I decided to buy some there the colors I
got were I'm not edible which is a pink
like a baby pink cream based with black
glitters in it and I love that finish so
much that I also got it in white and
this is called polka-dots and moonbeams
and also from Deborah Lippmann I got
million dollar mermaid and this just
makes me think of mega rosette because
she's always talking about being a
mermaid and everything and this is a
stunning sort of tangerine champagne
base with gold reflux and micro steamers
and copper glitter from makeup studio I
got a highlighter boost in number two
because this is what colleague and /
boss a little bit but skull tester has
and she loves to use this so whenever
she loves something I love it this is
the highlighter mousse by makeup studio
and it's basically all there is to it
it's a mousse that highlights and it's a
gorgeous color because it is sort of
like a champagne gold but the reflex
like the duochrome of it is like a pink
opal color so you have champagne and
pink opal and that's just like the two
best highlighters in the world combined
cause they smell really nice they smell
like like the beach like like like a
perfumed beach I love this plus my mouse
elseís in her webshop heads girls mates
guys dot and now um so if you want to
get your hands on this from shoe or Mura
I got two things I got a new eyelash
curler I always use this Uemura eyelash
curlers because they are the best in my
opinion and I got an eye shadow this is
numbered glitter bronze G bronze um this
is stunning
it really reminds me of one of those Tom
Ford eye pellets because they always
have like a glitter shadow in there and
this finish really reminds me of it
because it's glittery but not too
pigmented so you kind of get a pack of
glitter but it's packed that I have to
tell you funny story so I went to enter
with my boyfriend and we went to Schumer
I grabbed his brush and I felt it like
all the way through the store like
walking and I held it in my hand I'm
touching and feeling it and I got to the
counter to pay for these things plus the
brush and the guy who works there tells
me
like you know that's the expensive one
right and I was like sure a brush can't
be that expensive and he tells me
because you know it's number 12 and I
was like what is up with number 12 so I
still was like sure I want it so he goes
like oh well you know it's 165 euros
right the fog I was like oh god I don't
want that and then he came with like a
smaller size he was like but this is
only 85 euros I was like no don't want
that from OPI I got the rich Philip from
OPI I got the rich filler because I
heard great things about this and like
momentarily my nails are sort of ridgy
and I went to unreached them so I got
the rich filler by OPI he's talking
about nail polishes I got the three new
nail polishes from Chanel's PR from
their new summer collection so I got
Azure day which I did a full blog post
review on on my blog and I will put the
link down below and then I also got
Belle August they love this vellum goose
I don't know I don't know and I also got
lineThe / Lilly which is a really pretty
sort of coral color and they're from one
of their other collections I also got
taboo and this is strong name it's like
a galaxy in a bottle I also got all the
OCC lip tar stained glosses which I'm
wearing one right now I'm wearing new
wave on my face right now and these are
amazing I love the colors I love the
glossy finish I love this sort of steini
glossy finish I'm a really big fan of
these and love them then I found a store
in anko but that was fairly new to me
and they had like everything they had
like like stuff for carnivals and for
Halloween and everything but they also
have like stuff for it in your house and
like decorating stuff and it was an
amazing store so I got these glasses
right
so bad if you follow me on instagram you
have seen those by now and then I also
got an addition to my family on my wall
because I have Larry and Steve Larry and
Steve right there so I have Larry and
Steve and they got children they got
twins and these are Ben and Jerry so I
got two rhinos called Ben and Jerry
like the ice cream and I love these they
are so cute and they're oh my god just
look at them and I'm just gonna hang
them like right between Larry and
Steve's they're like a little happy
family of like a deer a moose and rhinos

I got a necklace and from Black Milk I
got the most amazing leggings ever like
ever in my life will you look at these
these are the chameleon mermaid leggings
by Black Milk and if you look closely
they have these sort of like oil slick
finish oh my gosh it's like an oil slick
bourbon thinking about meghanrosette
again and last but not least I got this
little thingy right here this is a lamp
with a light in it and I love it because
when I place it somewhat nearer to my
eyes you can see like a circle and I
love circles and eyes like so many
youtubers have that and I'm like oh and
I got another pair of leggings by Black
Milk these are the Queen of Hearts cards
leggings so the front is like the queen
