and oh god knows so before I start I
like to give you some updates because
last month when I started doing my March
hits and God knows I just I bombarded
you with so much personal stuff that I
think I have to give you an update on
some of that stuff right now I picked up
my new car
I had to totally get used to because
it's a really different way of driving
it because it's a totally different car
so it was really hard for me to learn
how to drive again with it so um for the
first two weeks it didn't feel like my
car I felt like someone else's car that
I was borrowing and it just didn't feel
right and just didn't feel like my car
but now that I fully mastered the way it
drives it definitely feels like my car
again and I'm so excited to have a new
car and the second update is I don't
know how we managed to do it I don't
know how I don't know who blessed us so
much but we got the apartment we're just
getting everything ready now to sign for
the apartment next week so next week it
will be officially our apartment and I'm
so excited and I want to thank you guys
so much for all your love and support on
the last video because you were so
supportive and you gave you so much love
and I think a lot of you has blessed us
because we got the apartment and it's
actually my boyfriend's birthday today
so if you want to you can wish him happy
birthday say happy birthday Rick and his
name is Rick we love you too mr.
tutorials so yeah all things came to a
good end and I'm so thankful for all
your love support and blessings and
thank you so without any further ado
let's go right on to my hits of April so
the first product I want to talk about I
already showed you in my March hit
synagogue knows but I want to show you
them again because I have a fun little
discount code for you now and I still
love them as much as I did in March I'm
talking about the color drain liquid
lipsticks I am in absolute love with
these and I'm just giving you a reminder
about these because I now has a 10%
discount code if you use the code
nikkietutorials at checkout on the color
rain web
you will get 10% off and these seriously
Rock my life I've been wearing them so
much this last couple of weeks and
they're coming out with new colors
they're coming out with a black they're
coming out with a sort of nudie darker
nude color the the kylie jenner color
and I'm so excited to try this out and
I'm so excited that they're back in
stock so if you want to get on to the
color drain boat which I absolutely
absolutely recommend it because these
are awesome then go ahead and get these
and you can use my discount code
nikkietutorials to get 10% off next I
want to talk about a product that has
changed my primer life my favorite
primer as of now is Nivea men aftershave
balm so I was out of primer and Rick
shaved his face and he had this stuff
lying around and I was like oh what's
that
so he told me that he uses Nivea men
aftershave balm because after a shave
home and then that same day I wanted to
do my makeup but I forgot about my
moisturizer and my primer and all
together I just forgot a whole bunch of
makeup that day then I was like why not
try Nivea men aftershave balm so I tried
it on and it smells like guys and it
it's very liquidy and it just it's very
liquidy and cooling but then I did my
makeup and I went throughout the day and
I notice how my makeup looked flawless
all day long no shine no whatsoever I
was like wait is this because of Nivea
men aftershave balm so I looked up the
ingredients and actually the second most
used ingredient in this aftershave balm
is glycerin now what does glycerin do
it's going to make whatever you put on
top stick to it so if you apply the
Nivea stuff right before you do your
foundation your foundation is going to
cling onto it it's going to stick onto
it and it's going to stay all day so
ever since I tried it out that day I
bought my own bottle I've been using it
for three weeks straight now and my
makeup has never stayed on so beautiful
for so long and I just feel when I put
my foundation on overtop I just feel it
clinging on
to each other it just makes the perfect
match next up I want to talk about a
bronzer this is by L'Oreal this is the
glam bronze litera puja Soleil face and
body Sun powder so this is just a
bronzer it's number one and I really
like this because it really suits my
fair skin tone it's a little bit on the
orangie side but for like summer or and
I really want to look warm as hell I'm
okay with that I've been using this for
a couple of weeks now to warm and bronze
up my face after I do my contouring and
I absolutely love it and I love it
especially because it's drugstore and
drugstore is always a good option now
little thing is I do not know if this is
in stores yet this is part of L'Oreal's
a summer collection and I do not know if
that is in stores yet if it is then go
get this if it's not then wait and then
get this because it's a great bronzer
next I want to talk about some brushes
that I've been adoring this month the
first one is by Mac it's C 221 I love
using this for my inner crease normally
I take a 217 or whatever equivalent of
another brand it has so many brands have
to 17s now that just call it differently
and then usually I use D 217 on the
outer portion of my eye increase but
then this 221 I like to use on the inner
crease and I love how it's precise but
it still blends out so nicely it's small
its precise but it still blends like a
dream it's a great great brush it's a
new one for Mac and it's actually
permanent so if you want it you can
still get it all year round it's just a
great brush for smaller eyes to this
next brush is by Sigma this is the FX 7
brush and I got this in the FX special
effects brushes set they came out with
an entire new set made for a special
effects makeup and then this FX 7 brush
is actually a great smudger for the
lower lash line I usually use the Sigma
smudger brush to apply my lower lash
line colors but then to really diffuse
and blend it in I use this FX 7 one and
it just it just glides so easy it just
blends the under eye area so nicely yet
still it's able to pack on
color so beautifully this is a great
brush and then the last brush I want to
talk about is by Rev derm Revie derm
revi
revi derm and this is their blush brush
but I do not use it for blush I use it
to highlight my face with and it's just
really flat it's a very flat blush brush
and small and petite and tiny therefore
I love it for a highlighter it just
really packs on highlighter but still
blends it out really softly and
beautifully at the same time so if you
really want that impact with your
highlighter but still want to blend it
out beautifully like a goddess you just
pick it up with this brush you place it
on the highest points of your cheekbones
and you blend it out and you're done
it's like the perfect glowy face in a
couple of seconds the two lip liners
I've been loving this month are my gosh
and these are the Velvet Touch lip
liners and the one I really really like
is Noga crisp and I will make a swatch
this is Noga crisp and it's just the
typical kylie jenner rosy nude color and
then the other one is called angel kiss
and this is just a beautiful nude so
here we got Noga crisp and here we got
angel kiss and I like combining this for
like the perfect matte lip pencil lip I
really like the darker one to align my
lips and give myself a little bit more
volume and then this one to fill in all
over and get a really nice nude shade I
really like these these stay on like a
trooper my favorite foundation this
month has been Studio Fix fluid by Mac
I've tried so many foundations these
past few months and I just keep coming
back to Studio Fix fluid because it
gives me the coverage that I'm looking
for it stays on so beautifully I have
dry skin when I do my makeup but
throughout the day I get super oily and
this is the only foundation for me that
looks beautiful when I'm dry but also
beautiful when I'm Aliyah stuff it's
just a beautiful foundation with a grey
coverage that lasts all day long and
whenever I wear Studio Fix fluid I just
feel so damn fabulous I just feel like a
Hollywood star when I wear this because
I'm like skin on point my last hits of
April were the House of lashes lashes
basically ever since I found out about
house of lashes these have been the only
lashes I've been wearing ever since
because they're such a good quality
they're are so luscious and beautiful
and they have so many amazing different
styles and a couple of my favorites are
of course iconic desi Perkins woo
I love starlet starlett it's like the
sister of iconic but it is a little bit
more rounded and full and then these are
some of my all-time favorites siren
they're so wispy and natural and divine
and I love them so those are a few of my
favorites I love how's the flashes
they're glue is the best best eyelash
glue ever talked about that before and
just the house of lashes are a total -
why am I talking with my hand so much
total total hits as for this month oh
god no I actually don't have one I do
have okay maybe I do hat okay maybe one
oh yeah no I'm on the fence about this
one because everyone on the internet
seems to adore the living out of this
I'm talking about the Armani luminous
silk foundation I feel so bad even
seeing this it's just everyone says it's
like this perfect foundation and it
makes you look glowy and the coverage is
great and it's just their Holy Grail and
every time I use luminous taupe by
Armani I'm like that I'm not seeing it
the coverage for me is so weird because
it will cling on to one certain part of
the face and then look watery on the
other parts of the face it's just really
patchy I find that it clings on to dry
patches I find that it's really hard and
difficult to build up now the finish is
absolutely amazing once you have put in
all the works to make it look nice and
even the finish is great you look
luminous you look beautiful you look
glowing but it's so damn hard to make
this work I just find that you have to
put so much work and effort into getting
this even and opaque and non patchy it's
just not worth the $50 so I can't
actually called it a god no because once
I do put in the effort and once I do
have an even coverage
the finish is great it looks beautiful
it lasts all day long it looks beautiful
but it's so hard to get there might just
be me might just be four more people but
so far on the Internet
all I can hear about luminous silk is
that it's amazing and I have to disagree
with that
it's amazing once it's on and once you
get that opaque coverage but starting
out with it and working with it is
difficult so that conclude my April hits
