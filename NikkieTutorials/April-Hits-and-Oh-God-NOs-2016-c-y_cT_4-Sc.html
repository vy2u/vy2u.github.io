my April hits and a God knows and April
has been crazy because I've been doing
so much traveling but it's great to be
back home and for the month of me I'm
gonna be home for a little bit which is
so amazing to me because I've been
traveling so much I feel like I could
become part of the cabin crew because by
now I pretty much know they're like
schedule and what they have to do it's
just I'm part of a team man so April has
been super special for me because I
don't know if you can notice but in
April I got my teeth did so I flew all
the way from Amsterdam to Dubai to meet
dr. Abba and dr. Appa is amazing I think
he is the best dentist on planet earth
one of my biggest fears always used to
be dentists and it has a lot to do with
my youth because a lot of shit happened
when I was a little kid at the dentist
and so dentist always kind of scared me
and I already had veneers done about
five years ago but they changed colour
so much and they just weren't what they
used to be and I felt like it didn't fit
my face they were too tiny
so I met dr. app' and he is such an
amazing sweet genuine guy and he showed
me what he envisioned for my teeth and I
totally agree to that vision and a
couple weeks later I got my veneers I
got new veneers and if you want to see a
before and after please go to my
Instagram where I do have a before and
after and since posting the before and
after I have noticed that not a lot of
people know what veneers are I will do a
full video on my teeth later on because
they filmed the entire experience the
entire journey so that will go on later
yeah if you are noticing a whiter
brighter smile that's because I got
videos and I am the happiest girl on
planet earth I'm so excited
and expect me to be smiling a lot more
now yes let's go into the fragrance so
in the month of April I have changed up
my skincare a little bit I tried some
new products left some products out I
think I don't know if this is a thing
that is possible but I feel like I was
using too many products at one point I
was just putting too much stuff on there
and it just it did nothing for my face
anymore and it ended up making my face
so dry so I cut back on a lot of
products and started trying new stuff
out and I brung back an old favorite of
mine this is the spin for perfect skin
by vanity planet and I shown this on
Instagram a lot of times right now and
we all know what this does this is a
face brush that takes your makeup off
plus it also preps the skin for makeup I
used as every other day to kind of extra
clean my face and also give it a soft
scruff I have developed super dry skin
and I love this because it's gentle but
still harsh enough to get rid of those
dead skin cells and reason why I like
this so much is because compared to all
other brands out there this is by far
the cheapest plus I have a discount code
I have it just got cold I put my code
down below in the screen and this will
give you 70% off on the screen for
perfect skin I highly suggest you
checking it out and I will do a how I
take my makeup off like mini a snapchat
story on snapchat in the coming weeks so
follow me on snapchat acne tutorials if
you want to see that so another skin
care product that has really changed my
skin in April is by Sunday Riley and if
you follow me on snapchat you've seen
this a lot of times this is called the
Juneau hydro active cell cellular face
oil I got this as a gift by my good
friend from Dubai Hin - and go follow me
on instagram he's an amazing artist and
this is an oil especially made for super
dry skin
ding-ding me so what I will do is I'll
take my makeup off with my favorite
cleanser by olavo and the perfect skin
brush and I'll take my makeup off with
that after that I'll put some Dior toner
on and then I'll go in with this oil the
Junot oil follow through with two of my
favourite olavo moisturizers and that's
it and my skin has changed so much it
looks nourished it looks healthy it
looks glowing it looks amazing and I
believe that's all because of the
perfect skin brush and this oil this oil
is amazing it's it I'm not going to lie
it's very expensive but so worth it if
you have dry skin trust me it will
change your
okay enough about skincare let's hop on
to actual makeup liners I've been really
loving are the Oprah fix line eyeliner
gels Forever Ago now I decided to hate
on gel liners because I only used the
Maybelline and the Mac ones and they
just they just didn't do it for me and
then I discovered about the Cavan D one
so I just I ignore gel liners because I
thought they were horrible
so Oprah was kind enough to send me
their fixed line eyeliner gels to try
out and I tried him and I was like oh
she'd hold up these are actually really
good and so then I kind of didn't want
to admit that I really liked him so I
kind of pushed them away again
but then I had to do a look with so much
eyeliner and so much precision that I
use them again and they are so amazing
I'm pretty positive that these are the
only eyeliner gels that do not have
transfer for me throughout the day or
whenever they dry quickly they are
intensely insanely pigmented easy to
work with creamy and wet enough to do
whatever the hell you want to deal with
it they come in a trillion colors and my
favorites being white black nude and the
blue they are good from the waterline
they are great for a winged liner I use
them to fill in my liquid liner today
and also to extend my inner corners and
extending inner corners you have to have
a good eye liner for that because if you
don't it's gonna run it's gonna go
everywhere it's gonna look like a hot
mess but with this it stays put and I
love this and I do have a discount code
for you on Oprah if you use code Nicki
you will get 30% off next I've been
obsessed with to hooda beauty lashes
these are the two my two favorites by
far have been scarlet this is just so
dramatic so intense but so amazing and
it just makes you look like a doll and
the other one I really love is Farrah
and I've talked about Farrah a lot of my
channel before I might even have
included it in a favorites video before
I'm gonna do it again cuz it's my
channel and not yours
so these two Hooda Beauty lashes have
been so amazing I've pretty much warned
these two all throughout the month and
especially Scarlett I always used to
think that Scarlett was way too intense
but then I actually started trying it
out more and more and I fallen in love
with it plus head of beauty lashes are
amazing and I truly truly support that
company because hood as amazing so if
you're looking for awesome a plus lashes
these are the ones you want to go for
I've also been getting a lot of
questions as to which new Hutta Beauty
lip contour colors are my favorites I
have two right here
my two favorite hooda Beauty lip contour
colors our trophy wife and bombshell and
especially together they make a perfect
win so these two colors right here are
my favorites for if you were wondering a
face powder I've only gotten recently
but has changed my life already is by
Estee Lauder this is the Double Wear
stay in place powder and I'm actually
shocked that it came in a light enough
color for me this is in the color 1 &amp;amp; 2
called Claire and this color is perfect
to get that extra kick of coverage and
keep you matte all day long but not give
it that cakey cakey feel um I think this
powder is beautiful it sets my makeup in
a stunning way and I'm a fan I'm a fan I
recommended I've only had this for about
two weeks but already amazing I finally
got my hands on the Too Faced melted
liquefied liquid lipsticks and I have
two all-time favorite colors my number
one being queen bee queen bee is the
color that I wore for my promotional
shots for my collaboration I'm going to
do with Too Faced later this skier I
don't know if I told you this on YouTube
but I am gonna collaborate with Too
Faced I'm gonna have my own special
limited edition collection coming out
this fall 2016
so for pretty much most of the
promotional shots I did I wore Queen B
because that is it's just such an
amazing color II just I can't even I
can't even and then if I wanted it to be
more nude and playful at
me so pretty over top which is an
amazing new din enough itself but
together this makes a killer ombre Newt
lip plus I also want to mention that I
think the formula and these are
top-notch and one of my all-time
favorites
all right last make a product so I want
to mention I want to save best for last
I've been talking about these on
snapchat quite a lot but you know what
I'm going to talk about some more I of
course I'm going to mention that morphe
came out with 35o palace in all matte
and all shimmer additions this is the
all shimmer the 3500 all shimmer Edition
and oh my god so there's this one shadow
in the original 35 oh and it's super
creamy super buttery it's shiny shimmery
it's like when you touch it it feels
like butter
so when I saw that if morphe came out
with an all shimmer palette
I was hoping praying that that pallid
would be that shimmery eyeshadow all of
them and you know what they did that
formula that finish is all of these all
of them are like that they are amazing
and I'm actually wearing some colors on
my eyes today and I am love so beautiful
I love you need this in your life and if
that didn't convince you and you're a
mad person oh honey oh honey be 3500 all
not addition this is my GM I am so in
love with this I basically never need a
warm neutral color in my life again
because I am done I am done I am done I
love these two so much I am so obsessed
I'm wearing them today I'm so obsessed
and I can't even deal and that's it guys
that are all my hits for the month of
April let's go on to my oh god no oh
yeah
uh no alright guys my oh god no this
month I feel like this will piss a lot
of you off but you know I want my
channel to be all about honesty and I
always give you nothing but the truth
and I feel like I have to share this
with you because it is not working out
for me so for the longest time in the
past I used the NARS creamy concealer in
Chantilly now everyone and their mama
and their stepmom and their grandmama
and their step grandmama have been using
the creamy concealer by NARS and have
been raving about it so a couple years
ago I tried it almost daily and I always
wondered why my concealer game was an on
point you know what I thought it's it's
me it's not the concealer it's me so
then I found out about it cosmetics bye
bye under-eye naked skin by Urban Decay
so many other better concealers out
there and it's tucked my concealer game
up so a couple of weeks ago I saw
someone uses again and I was like I
should try that again to see if it was
actually if it was me or the concealer
and I have found out that this concealer
is a bitch it gives you almost no time
to blend it in before kicking up and
becoming dry and hard to work with I
feel like if you have dry skin like me
it will accentuate that it will seep
into fine lines it will accentuate
dryness and it will just not look pretty
the worst thing of it all is that even
when I bake even when I set that powder
underneath my eyes with a damp Beauty
Blender it creases and you know what
that is just too much for concealer to
work so I say goodbye and that's it guys
that were my hits and a god knows of the
month April what were your heads and I
got this please let me know in the
