to bring you my April hits and no God
knows and April has been ended it is
done so with April and it's time for me
and I love maybe cuz it's my boyfriend's
birthday MA it's my brother's birthday
in May it's my other brother's birthday
in May it's my friends it's Joyce's
birthday in May it is another brothers
birthday in May we have so many
birthdays in May that I don't know what
gifts to get anymore I'm just I am
blanked out so for me me is gonna be all
about the birthdays but for now today
I'm here to bring you my April favorites
and I actually have somewhat of a like
depressing story for you guys to start
with in April I had surgery in my stuff
like on or in my stomach it's a really
long story but something was wrong with
my intestines like might might is that
what you call him in English let's just
say like the thing where your food comes
through there was a hole in it and we
had to take care of that so I was sick I
had surgery I was in hospital for five
days so I want to apologize for that and
I know like the last couple of months
I've been really slacking on uploading
videos but my social life is going great
and then my intestines started to like
hate me and I uh I'm trying to find time
to fill my videos and without any sort
of depressing stuff let's just go right
ahead to my April favorites hit centre
God knows and uh let's go okay this lip
is not going to work
lipstick change okay so the first
favorite of April has been my the
Porefessional by benefit and hi I love
this I never really tried benefit
products I never really I just never
really came around to getting any of
their stuff and what has to do with that
is that their stuff is kind of expensive
and sometimes I'm just like no no price
tag no so what this does is it just
makes your pores look gone it really
works but what I love most about this is
that this keeps my makeup on for
our work you guys know that I swear by
my makeup for ever HD primer this stuff
keeps my makeup on better than this
stuff another benefit product that I
love is the they're real mascara and
what I love about this is that it really
separates the lashes plus really it sort
of makes them look as if you place them
in a like a really fake way and I think
that is why they call moon drops it but
you guys know that I never ever ever
like use mascara on their own
the first mascara I always put on my
lashes is the makeup studio waterproof
3dx or black my mom sells this in her
web shop so this always goes on first
and then this like that their real one
is for a second layer and these together
are perfection I have these on my lashes
right now and I love it
this is sort of like a weird favorite
this month but the Mac 252 brush I
basically got it like three years ago
because I saw makeup by Tiffany do you
use it back then and I'm like whatever
she used back then I was like I have to
have that like I kind of used it for
stuff but not really like that
interested in it I just didn't like feel
the love that much but home Anne like
 like a couple of weeks ago I just I
just saw this brush and I always kind of
like powder like I I can steal above my
brows here on the side and I always have
to set them with a brush with powder so
I use this one and I just I I used it I
was like oh that's perfect I just kind
of used it from irrelevant as well oh
wait we could do a here and here and
here and here and here and here I I love
this brush then something that I did not
see coming as a favorite this month or
as a hit a hit this is the Lee O'Malley
skin fix powder packed in oil control
type and number 21 blooming ivory I love
the packaging it's so I did a whole blog
post review on this on my blog needs it
tutorials calm plus I will put the link
the infobox below so you can check the
review out in that review I kind of told
you all to like don't even
bother because it's it's nice but it's
kind of expensive and it's kind of a
hassle to get it and I I wouldn't really
recommend it Bubble Boy again what
went wrong with me I don't know I just
like the couple of last week's I just
it's perfect for setting that concealer
above my brown on the side and I used it
on my brow bone all the time every day I
use it to set my breakouts and stuff
then an eyeliner that I feel loving is
by NYX and this is the slide on glide on
stay on and definitely a turn-on
waterproof extreme shine eyeliner this
eyeliner is so good the name had to be
this long NYX
no they're kind of right though this
eyeliner is so good it just stays on the
entire day you put this on it just stays
on and the color is so good it is this
is called golden bronze golden bronze
it's bronzy and golden I'm wearing it on
my waterline right now it's just it's
sort of my safe way out of black and
brown I just went I want a little bit
more definition on my waterline itself I
use this because I feel like black is
too harsh on me Brown is too boring and
bronze is perfect and some of you guys
know I teach at the academy on Sundays
in Amsterdam where I teach makeup along
with the skull t-shirt and one of our
students like like last the last class
she showed me the Easton law ledouche a
class foundation and I tried it on my
hand hated it I was like how can you
that and then I kinda I saw Lisa
Eldridge used it I saw all these makeup
artists use it and I just was I I have
to try it and this is numbered b10 and i
love this it's so so good though
consistency the formula is beautiful it
just gives you this really flawless
finish it just stays on the entire day
but maybe that's because of my
professional by benefit let's go into
jewelry I got this wrong we necklace and
this is
Batman Batman I got it at wrong be calm
I will put the link down below in the
info box or when I wear this I just feel
like that girl and I'm like huh
Christian bill where are you at boy and
then yesterday I went shopping with my
good friend Joyce and we went to
Claire's and um I know I only got these
yesterday but I already love them to
death these are earrings that sort of
like go through the back up here to the
front and then you have sort of like the
whole thing in your ear these are
dinosaurs
I bought dinosaurs and I bought wait for
it wait for it
unicorns so the back of the unicorn goes
in the back of your ear and then the
front of the unicorn goes in the front
of your ear they're so cute and probably
look like an idiot wearing these but I
felt so awesome with these on also
quickly a big favorite this month it's
the shirt that I'm wearing right now and
I when I saw this yesterday I also
bought this yesterday and I already
loved it to death as you can see this
shirt is yellow and what this shirt says
is yellow is not my color I don't know
who came up with that in H&amp;amp;M but that is
genius
let's go on to other hits this month a
huge like bombastically huge hit this
month was Ellie Goulding's new album sir
the new album um and I'm gonna butcher
this wait no I'm not gonna do it
no way oh okay so a huge hit this month
has been Ellie Goulding's album hot
seein alcian again I seein this album is
sick
it is amazing and especially I'm gonna
be pathetic again I was in a hospital
and explosions came on my phone I have
my earbuds in with like them dr. dre
beats and everything all fancy in my
hospital bed and I was listening to her
album and then explosions came on and I
cried my freakin ass off I didn't even
feel like a crybaby I just like I was
crying so hard so freaking hard because
of its blow
their movie that I loved this month was
anakata Nina with Keira Knightley love
that movie
and that dude that dude that place that
like the depth cheating bastard he is so
oh goodness gracious Jesus Louise eating
crackers he's got a vow oh I probably
love this movie so much because he was
in it don't judge okay so that's it for
all my hits this month now let's just go
on to the oh god no no the first oh god
no this month is this brushed by
Illamasqua and I hate to say this
because the Illamasqua is one of my
favorite brands this is the Illamasqua
it doesn't even have a name but this is
one of their new brushes and I don't get
this it's so hard and so dense and the
shape is so they they told me like in
the email to use it for contouring
everything but I would just look like an
unfinished drag queen when I use this
hand girl no the super plus BB cream by
skin79 the amount of youtubers I've seen
using this and raving about it and
loving it I to not get because I have
used this and I just I don't get it it's
just it looks great it makes you look
great it makes you look dead the
coverage blah and I'm just not a BB
cream lover at all and this just made me
hate them even more but that's different
