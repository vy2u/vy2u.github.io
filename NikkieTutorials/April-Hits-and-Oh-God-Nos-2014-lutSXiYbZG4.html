God knows so my uh God knows and and
hits for April so without any further
ado let's go on to the first hit so the
first thing I want to talk about and it
is something that has saved me this
month is the steli Henson instant
cuticle remover maximum strength and
skip that it's the instant cuticle
remover I haven't done or looked after
my kneels and cuticles for icings two to
three months and I don't know why
because I really like painting my nails
but it's just I did not have the right
set of mind to do my nails I don't know
I just didn't feel like it so yesterday
I did my nails I finally painted them
again and on this color on my nails will
be a hit as well it will come right
after this boiler my cuticles were
horrible I mean like when you watch a
horror flick this was like worse my
cuticles were like oh my gosh so what I
did was I put the Sally Hansen instant
cuticle remover onto my cuticles and
this works in 15 seconds so you wait for
15 seconds and then you take one of
those pushers and you push it back and
with those pushers I could actually
scrape some of the cuticle office well
this is so disgusting I'm sorry it works
absolute wonders and I am in love with
my cuticles that well they could use a
little bit of moisturizing other than
that my cuticles are looking fresh and
perfect and pretty again and I'm so
excited so get this get this it's
awesome so as I told you spoiler alert
the next hit is by Kiko and this is the
338 nail polish and I talked about this
in my Ibiza haul and it's such an
amazing pop of periwinkle I'm absolutely
in love with periwinkle at the moment so
it's on my nails and I absolutely love
it and just a formula on this is
absolutely amazing because you just need
two easy coats and you're done you need
your top coat and you're done and if you
want to see this a little bit more
detailed then go to my blog
nikkietutorials calm because I have a
full review on this on my blog the next
hit is another product by Kiko and this
is the cleansing
eyes and lips makeup remover I always
used to use my eBay uh be face lotion by
makeup studio I guess and I've been
using them for like two to three years
so I really wanted to switch things up
because I read somewhere that if you use
a product for too long you can get
allergic to it and that's not what I
want so I got the Kiko cleansing eyes
and lips makeup remover and this is
maybe even better it's so much cheaper
it gets the makeup off even quicker it
doesn't I have no work I love it staying
in these sort of skincare range I want
to talk about motorcycles I want to talk
about the Hanna clarity cream this is a
new product by Hanna and as you know I
absolutely love Hanna my mom works with
henna in her beauty salon and so they
brought out the new clarity cream and
I've been testing it out for a month now
and it is Phan freaking tabloids I have
my skincare routine which is basically
henna products only and this got into
the routine as well and kicked another
product out and it's absolutely amazing
it feels very liquidy and runny on your
hands but once you buff it into the skin
it really becomes this nice kick-off
moisture and it has a really fresh scent
it smells like um it smells a little bit
like jasmine my mom sells this in her
webshop head tongue ahead start it now
and I'm not just saying this just
because I absolutely do love this
clearity cream next thing I want to talk
about are zoeva brushes I am obsessed
with zoeva brushes I was doing makeup
for a show in Belgium with Joyce my good
friend Joyce and we did makeup for that
show and Joyce was the one who actually
introduced me to so we have our brushes
and she showed me a couple of her
favorites and um so immediately when I
got home I had to place an order so I
think I ordered in total about twelve
brushes which you're gonna die right now
but with those twelve brushes it only
cost me about sixty dollars now that was
the first order but with that many
brushes it only cost me like sixty to
eighty dollars whereas if you will buy
two Mac brushes you would also pay $80
for it so we've our brushes are
so so cheap the quality is amazing
they're better than Sigma and Mak yes I
said it I did it I said it and so it is
done and the first one I want to talk
about is C 231 luxe petite crease and
this is just a really concentrated
crease brush that you just you sort of
wiggle it in your eye like this you
don't really have to pay attention to it
and bam you have your crease there I
love this a more mature skin plus on
myself so everyone and then also I
really like the 228 and this is the
crease brush and this is like the Mac
224 but this one is a little bit softer
and a little bit more dense and I just
find blending with this one is easy as
as as peaking and you just you just put
it here in your crease and you fluff it
out and it looks amazing
I am absolutely in love with these Zoe
fab brushes and um yeah so I I love that
the next thing I want to talk about is
the Real Techniques miracle complexion
sponge and I bought three so I'm going
to show you a clean one in its packaging
so so I ordered three of these because I
heard that these were better than the
beauty blenders and a Beauty Blender to
have like hella expensive I've always
loved the Beauty blenders I've killed a
few thirty years by now and when I saw
that um Real Techniques came out with a
sponge and people actually said it was
better than the Beauty Blender I was
like okay I'm gonna order a few holy
sponge this is probably the best makeup
sponge on the market it is and this is
what kind of knocks me out from buying
different sponges than the Beauty
Blender because the Beauty Blender is
really soft and it's just really squishy
and it's just it feels like a magic
sponge tapping on your complexion and
every time I wanted to buy a different
sponge other than the Beauty Blender I
would find that they were too harsh too
packed too dense too too too harsh on
the face so I ordered the Real
Techniques one I opened it up and I felt
it and I was like oh here we go
again it's really stiff and harsh and
whatever but once you rinse this
through the water and once you make it
wet and dampen it this just it bloats up
becomes the most amazing makeup sponge
ever and I love that it has that flat
side I use that for right here and then
I use the point four in the inner
corners of my eyes it's an amazing
sponge and the best thing about it is
that it is cheap it's like six to seven
dollars okay moving on I really want to
highlight the L'Oreal extraordinary
liquid lipsticks color riche liquid
lipsticks I did a full blog post review
on this today before yesterday and I
want to highlight my three favorite
colors and that are 2:04 tangerine
sonate 304 ruby opera and 4:01 fuchsia
drama i am obsessing over the liquid
lipsticks by l'oreal because they are
pigmented they are smooth they apply
like butter um and it's just they're so
easy to work with and I love that
L'Oreal came out with bright colors so
if you want to take a closer look at
these then definitely go check out my
review my blogpost review in the info
box I'll put the link there and then you
can just see swatches and all that's but
these are amazing
next is the Lancome LeConte or lip
pencil in 211 beige rose and oh oh my
god as you know I love lining my lips
and making my lips look a little bit
fuller using a lip pencil and I use
Mac's stripped down I used a couple of
other pencils but I found most of them
to be either too dark or too light and I
never got the sort of the perfect shade
so then I found long combs 211 beige
rose which I'm wearing around my lips
right now and it just makes my lips look
so naturally fuller and plumper and
amazing art and I'm just in love with
this pencil because it's just so it
gives that plumpness and fullness
without going like hey Sharon Needles
where are you going the last thing I
want to talk about is Mac's
lip glass in pink lemonade and I think
you can feel this coming I got this
because of Matthew Anderson here we go
again as you know I absolutely love
Matthew and whatever
he does I love and he did a
transformation on James and James on
world of wonder and at the end of the
tutorial he said living up any dead
beige with a bit of pink lemonade it's
my favorite combo I was like okay
because let me tell you when Matthew
Anderson tells you what his favorite
product is for something you get that
I'm wearing it on my lips right now and
it just it makes a nude color a little
bit more punchy and a little bit more
you know young and fresh and I
absolutely I just I can't deal I love
this color so much oh I also definitely
want to include Game of Thrones in my
hips this month i Game of Thrones
started its fourth season a couple of
weeks ago and oh gosh you all know what
episode I'm thinking about right now oh
yes that that moment go watch it if you
don't want I'm making all my friends
watch it right now yes okay so that's it
for the hits let's go on to del Gallo oh
yeah
no so unfortunately I only have one oh
god no this month and I did a blog post
review on it recently the bargain beauty
brand mua made its way over to Holland
and I was like yes finally if there's
one thing I love doing on my blog it's
reviewing the lipsticks so I was like
okay I'm gonna do a review on mu AIDS um
this is called matte lipstick in
peachy-keen
and I was I guess the color amazeballs
the packaging super cute and the fun
thing is is that there's a lipstick in
the back I was like that's just made for
perfection so I tried the lipstick out
and basically it was just it was dry it
looked it just went into the nooks and
crannies of the lips it just went into
lines it looked a little bit as if a
peachy-keen man came all over her look
it was not a success and I have to admit
that in my blog post review I was a
little bit more positive on it because I
didn't want to bash the brand completely
and on that note everybody that
