inspired by Arabian Nights I want it
really serious eyeliner really nice soft
warm tones and knowing me I had to add
some jewels in there today is also this
video is also the makeup buzz tag this
is a tech I'm creating so simple create
a full makeup look using products that
are super hyped about super buzzed-about
think Urban Decay Naked 3 palette think
the lorac Pro palette and if you do not
have those products I want you to use
something that you think should be
bussed or hyped about so I thought this
was really fun because this way we can
really see what people think of the
hyped about Prague's do we like him do
we not like him it's fun to see what
people would do with a look entirely out
of hyped about products I don't know I
was on the toilet this came up so I was
like oh that's a fun idea other than
that let's just go I hope you enjoy
alright so the first product I have in
mind for the makeup bus tag is a product
that has been so talked about that you
just you just want to try a sample of it
because everyone is talking about it
and the products I'm talking about is
our glasses mineral veil primer I have
tried it once before which was on camera
mmm wasn't the biggest fan of it then
and then just with your fingers start
blending this in okay therefore
foundation I'm going with my benefit
hello flawless oxygen Wow brightening
makeup foundation and I'm the color I'm
pure for sure ivory and if you're really
liking this one lately it gets it just
it looks beautiful on camera so I'm just
going to take a bit and dot it onto my
skin alright and then I'm using a new
foundation brush this is by Sigma this
is the 3d HD kabuki foundation brush and
it's a weird little guy it has a
triangle so I'm just going to use that
to start stippling in hello flawless by
benefit and holy this brush gives
you full coverage and then with that
point
can actually reach the eye is really
easily oh my god all right so that is an
absolutely fantastic brush I really
recommend this one
so for concealer I either wanted to go
for the NARS creamy concealer because on
YouTube it's like you either use the
NARS creamy concealer or you use the pro
longwear and I'm going to use Pro
Longwear because it's it's my beige and
then to buff this in I'm using my Sigma
F 86 and I'm going to set my under eye
area using emphasize a shaping powder by
Mac all right now I'm going to do brows
off camera because if I did it on camera
this video will become way too long but
the products I'll be using for my brows
are also buzzed-about
makeup products I will be doing my brows
using the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills brow
Wiz in ash blonde and also the dip brow
pomade in taupe so I'll be doing my
brows for eyes are going to start off by
priming them of course and I'm using my
soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac my first
eyeshadow is going to come from the
Urban Decay Naked 3 palette and it's
going to be the color nooner reason why
I chose the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette
is because it's the Urban Decay Naked 3
palette I am taking nooner and I'm going
to apply it straight to the crease and
first mainly focusing on this outer edge
here but then once most product is on I
work my way to the inner corners of my
crease for the lid I'm taking my Anasazi
Beverly Hills tamanna' palette and going
in the color china rose and I'm applying
this to the inner half of my lids and oh
can you look at this color I am now
going in that same palette and I'm
taking sangria and this is going on the
outer half of the lid meeting up to the
crease
and then I'm actually taking a blending
brush with sangria and applying this to
the crease to give it a little bit of
that warmer color that sangria has it's
a blended in nicer then still using the
tamanna' pellet I'm going in chocolate
and for this look I want a fairly
colorful lid and really smoky liner and
underneath portion so this is going from
inner to outer corner on the lower lash
line and then to blend this out and give
it a nice smoky feel and going back into
sangria and I'm using this to soften and
blend out chocolate on the lower lash
line and then now it's time for the
liner I'm taking my Sigma wicked
standout eyes gel eyeliner to start off
with and I'm going to start off with a
line right here determining where I want
my angle to go to from my line
and then switching over to the Kat Von D
tattoo liner in trooper this product has
been talked about so so much first let's
just fill in that sort of triangle we
create it okay then for the inner corner
for this little thingy right here you
want to look down and sort of pull the
top line of your inner corner down from
that line you go back to the the lower
lashline portion and then you have a
little triangle you fill it in fill up
and then all we want to do is connect
this corner to that line right there
on the waterline I'm using the hourglass
1.5 millimeter mechanical gel liner in
obsidian and this is one of the products
that I wish is going to create some
serious buzz in the community I'm really
a lover of putting something right
underneath the pupil at the eye so for
this I'm going to use my born pretty
store nail art wheel thingymajig right
here and there are some seriously small
gold studs in there and I'm just going
to pop them right on the skin on the eye
everything
okay so there's that now to completely
finish off the ice I need some falsies
I'll be using my Shen X Oh soul mates
lashes alright so for takes the first
kind of sculpt and contour the face and
I'm using my Anastasia Beverly Hills
contour kit for this everyone also and
their mamas Grandmama's Grande Papa's
everyone is using the contour kit on
YouTube to either highlight or contour
so I figured that is what I'll be using
and I'm going to take a little bit of
this color right here because it's the
coolest out of the three and I
definitely need that with my pale skin
tone so I'm just going to start carving
the cheeks out next up to give my face a
lovely bronze I'm going to mix two
products again taking the contour kit
and taking the warmest color out of the
three which is this one right here and
I'm mixing it with benefits hoola
bronzer you've seen that on YouTube I'm
just going to lightly dust that over the
contour and on the high plains of my
face to give myself warmth for blush I'm
going to make a mixture with Max and
mineralized blush in warm soul you've
seen that before and benefits curly
stuff and then for my highlighter today
I'm using Mac's mineralize skinfinish in
soft and gentle this is a youtube staple
everyone has this okay for lips it was
kind of hard to choose what I wanted to
go with because there are so many
options I first wanted to go for a
melted lipstick by Too Faced but I
wanted to go nude then it was like okay
is velvet teddy by Mac because of kylie
jenner I'm going to do something that I
wish was a little bit more buzzed about
in the community but first a product
that is really buzzed about it's the
world lip pencil by Mac and this really
got its attention once Kylie Jenner
started using it
then for lipstick I'm going to use a
product that I really wish I would see
more of here on YouTube and I'm talking
about the NARS Velvet Matte lip pencil
in bolero
so gorgeous so stunning and people need
this then to finish off with a gloss I'm
going to use the butter cloth in creme
brulee by NYX and butter glosses by NYX
in and of itself are like a huge hit
everywhere but creme brulee in
particular is like the biggest star of
them all and that guys concludes this
Arabian Nights smokey eyes the makeup
