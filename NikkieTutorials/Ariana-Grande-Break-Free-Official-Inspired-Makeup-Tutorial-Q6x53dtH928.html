with requests for our AMS new music
video break free and as soon as I saw
the music video I fell in love with that
girl again all over again I started to
really love her with problem but now
with break free and it actually has a
music video now I love her even more so
this look right here is inspired by
ariana when she has the glitter lipstick
on and those really really awesome sexy
eyeline your eyes I love the makeup look
with like the white designs on her head
but I really fell in love with the look
with the glitter lips because I've never
done glued our lips before and I've
always wanted to do glitter lips so
today was like yes glitter lips I could
finally do them and I know I did problem
just a couple of weeks ago but I just
got so many requests for this and I just
love the makeup look and it was a little
bit different than problem the lips
eyeliner was different different shadows
so I was like I'm just gonna do it yeah
if you want to know how to get this
ariana break free makeup look then
please keep on watching for my base
today I want to go really glowy and
radiant and for that I'll be using my
chanel leblanc and also mixing that with
Becca shimmering skin Perfector in pearl
and I'm just applying this with my
fingers there for foundation I'm going
to use mineralized moisture by Mac and
this is nc15 and first just applying it
to my face and then with my Sigma f80
brush I'm going to start buffing that in
then to further perfect my face I'm
going to go with some concealer this is
max NC 15 Pro Longwear concealer and
just applying this underneath my eyes
and I'm going to try and make my
cheekbones look a little bit higher up
so I'm doing the entire almost
triangular thing with the concealer all
right and then as usual I'm buffing this
in using my Sigma F 86 brush
okay now I'm gonna set this with powder
I'm gonna use my usual Chanel natural is
finished powder in 20 Clarence my
favorite and then I'm gonna do brows and
one eye off-camera and then it will be
back so the first thing I'll be doing is
applying a base to my eyelids to prevent
I should have increasing and I'll be
using my soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac
from this for this got the first
eyeshadow we'll be using is cork by Mac
and with a big fluffy brush this is used
to create definition in my crease and
also blending it all the way to the very
inner corner here and you just want to
place it and softly diffuse the top
edges out I also want to brush some of
that core color onto the outer third of
my lids and then blending with the
crease again and this to create some
depth on the outer third here now taking
the lorac unzipped palette and I'll be
mixing undiscovered with unbelievable
and I'm applying that mixture to the
inner part of my lids meeting up to the
crease and then kind of fading out into
that brown color that core color that we
placed previously then you want to go
and take cork with that same fluffy
brush again and kind of diffuse and
blend in the edges and that just gives
you the perfect sort of rose gold shade
that ariana was wearing now I'll be
taking my NARS alhambra eyeshadow duo
and I'm going to take the golden color
and I'm lightly dusting that golden
color over top at the middle of my lid
and again going back in with my fluffy
brush and cork to diffuse the edges for
the inner corner taking a bit of
undercover and mixing it with this shade
from the alhambra duo and that duo is
going on my very inner corners meeting
up with that combo from the unzipped
palette we used before
and kind of blend in the edges for my
lower lash kind of going in with a
little bit of eye Kohl by Mac and this
is called power surge and I'm applying
this color as close to the roots of my
lashes as possible and then with LM s
cos stealing gel and Mac's tempting
eyeshadow I'm going to make a nice
mixture between those two and apply that
over top for a nice Sparkle and that
just makes the most beautiful sparkly
green brown color
I love it okay now it's time for the
liquid liner and as always I'll be using
my Catrice a liquid liner in dating Jo
black for this for the line what you
want to do is you want to make the
outside corner of the wing a little bit
more thick and you know present there
and then the closer you come into the
inner corner the more precise and thing
you want your line to be so this way it
gets a really nice elongated cat eye
effect and that is exactly what Ariana
was wearing as well
okay and now it's time to do one of her
eye jewels that she had right here now I
know that Ariana was having a really
nice silver crystal colored sequin there
I don't have that believe it or not I do
not own one that size so I'm gonna
change it up a little bit I really like
gold so I popped a gold stock right
there a circle stud around a dot a gold
dot stud and I got it from this wheel
right here and I will put a link down
below on where you can get this and the
gold dud stud is right here and I'll be
applying that as my side I jewelry it's
very easy to apply just apply some glue
or you want it and then you wet a q-tip
and then really easily you can just pick
one up and place it where you want to
now it's time for some mascara I'm gonna
go with my makeup City of what approved
3d in extra black and four lashes up
using the Mac 36 for cheeks is gonna be
really easy I'm just gonna contour and
shape out my face a little bit more to
give me a little bit more of definition
because let's be honest Ariana has the
cutest cheeks too so don't blush law so
with a little bit of my illamasqua
heroine eyeshadow I am just going to
sculpt out with cheeks a little and then
to give my complexion a really nice
warmth and going with disobey by
Illamasqua and just applying that over
top I'm also applying that as my blush a
little bit now for highlighter I want to
go for this amazing new product this is
by collistar and this is the twist XL
all-over highlighter comes in a little
stick like this and this is the number
one beige d'amato and it's just a
stunning champagne rose gold highlighter
so actually just going to take a bit
with my finger and tap that
where I want to highlight and oh my god
this is so gorgeous
so my god thought that is stunning then
I'm also padding that down the bridge of
my nose and the tip of my nose Cupid's
bow I love that okay then for those
amazing glitter lips I'm first going to
line my lips to give them a little bit
more fullness and volume and that is
definitely what they did on Oriana as
well
for that I'll be using my LeConte or lip
liner by Lancome and this is 211 beige
rose
and her glittery lips had this really
nice soft rosy pinky color with a little
bit of peach with quite the mix so for
that I'm dabbing on a little bit of
lipstick this is by NYX and this is
strawberry milk so that gives us a nice
base color to work with now for the
glitter the glitters I'll be using are
by OCC and this is the glitter in pink
very fitting and I'm also going to mix
in a little bit of the base glitter in
the middle so I kind of get this glitter
ombre lip going on to make glitter stick
you need something very sticky so I went
for the stickiest gloss I could find in
my collection and those are definitely
the dazzle glasses by Mac and the color
I'll be using today is called baby
sparks and it has a little bit of that
same colored glitter in there so I
figured it's a nice base you want to
remember that wherever you apply the
gloss the glitter is going to stick on
to so you want to make this as neat and
straight as possible
okay so that is very sticky and pornstar
if you ask me it's time to Pat some
glitter on top
