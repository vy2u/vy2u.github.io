I've gotten a lot of requests for a
Ariana Grande look and I I'm just loving
Ariana at the moment because I started
to like her with problem but now that
she came out with break free I am just
like oh my god Arianna Arianna Arianna
Arianna she is super cute super girly I
love break free and I think this is
really Ariana's time to break through
break free see I've gotten a lot of
requests to do an Ariana look and
especially inspired by her music video
for problem so here I am doing it for
you today I really like it it's very
natural with a twist it's super easy to
do and yeah
without any further ado if you want to
know how to get this ariana grande look
then please keep on watching to achieve
Ariana's beautiful skin you first of
course want to prep it what I'll be
using today is my good scale labs true
hydration 24 hour gel cream and over top
on my t-zone a little bit of good scale
laps pore 365 so first I'm buffing the
true hydration by good skin labs in
really loving this one
and then taking a little bit of the pore
365 and focusing this on my t-zone for a
foundation you want to go light but
flawless and for that I think the
perfect match will be a mixture between
Mac's a face and body this is c1 and a
little bit of my trusty L'Oreal True
Match in n1 and I'm first going to play
some of it onto my skin and then with my
makeup geek Phoenician stippling brush
I'm going to buff this in
and the little by little you can pick up
some more foundation and add it where
you think you need it and this way you
will get a really nice flawless base
without going cake face I'm now going to
further perfect my complexion using my
mac prolongwear concealer in NC 15 and a
little bit of the L'Oreal Lumi magique
touch of light highlighter pen
and as always I'm buffing this in using
my Sigma f80 6 tapered kabuki brush now
lightly going to set this using a powder
and my favorite is Deschanel natural is
finished powder in number 20 Clair I
will also be doing brows and one eye
off-camera and then it will be back so
in order to make this look last all day
long you want to apply a base here I'll
it and I'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot for today's look I'll be using the
Too Faced chocolate bar and I'll be
making a mixture between this color
right here and their color right there
okay we just talked about how good this
palette smells so I'll be applying those
two right on to my lid blending up to
the crease and I love this because
although Ariana's look is really natural
and it seems to be like she's not
wearing a lot there is a matte mid Brown
going on on her lids increase and that
just gives a little bit more definition
and I love that about her
then with a blending brush and some more
of those two colors I'm going to softly
blend up now you can take this as far up
as you like and of course what suits
your eye shape and because my eyes have
a little bit of that hooded feeling I'm
going to go a little bit further up to
make them seem more sinking in now going
back into the chocolate bar and taking
this highlighting color and with this
I'm just highlighting my brow bone
blending with the brown and I'm also
going to put that on the very inner
corner to open up my eyes for the lower
lash line I'll be using this color right
here and this darker color and I'm just
really lightly going to apply this to
the very outer corner of my lower lash
line and then super softly whisk it in
till about the 1/2 of your lower lash
line Ariana really likes to put a dark
color on her waterline because her eyes
are so big that kind of smalls them down
a bit
but because my eyes are quite a lot
smaller I need to make them bigger
however to stick to today's theme I am
gonna line my waterline with it I'm just
because it's ariana grande but if you
have somewhat smaller eyes like I do you
can totally skip the step for my
waterline I'll be using an essence
long-lasting eye pencil and this is hot
chocolate and I'm just softly going to
run that along my waterline all the way
to the inner corner and no Ariana Grande
look is completed with a winged girly
cutesy eyeliner and for that I'll be
using mica trees liquid liner in dating
Jo black you want to start off by making
that line where you want your wing to go
to now the longer you make this the more
extreme your line is going to be so the
shorter and yeah the shorter you keep it
the net roller it's got to be got damn
then from that line bring the eyeliner
back into the lash line fill in and when
she got that wing you simply want to
take it towards the inner corner in a
very thin manner
and once you got the cute and girly
eyeliner it's time for mascara I'll be
using my makeup studio waterproof 3d and
extra black and on top a little bit of
my Mac extended play gigablack lash I'm
also going to be using corner lashes to
give me that extra girly Flair and these
are the XO Beauty flirt for cheeks you
want to go contoured fresh and glowy so
first I'll be sculpting on my cheeks
using my heroine eyes shadow by
Illamasqua then to further warm up my
face I'm gonna go with Illamasqua
disobey okay then it's time for blush
you don't want to go too far with this
because with Ariana all the attention
has to go to those like really cute
flirty eyes um so for blush I'm gonna go
with Mac's a launch away it's just a
really natural peachy color and I'm just
gonna brush this onto the apples of my
cheeks and then blending back into my
contour but to give herself that really
fresh and youthful glow that Ariana has
as well I'm gonna go with my the bone
cindy lou manizer this is just glow in a
pot this makes you look so youthful and
healthy and glowy and I love this so
much
and then just spark it up a little bit
more on the highest points of my cheeks
and just high points of the face I'm
going to go with Mac's extra dimension
eyes shadow in a natural flirt for lips
you want to go for a very nice matte
nude pinky pout so for that I'll be
using my Lancome the contour base bethe
little bit 211 beige rose lip pencil I'm
gonna fill my lips in entirely with this
pencil
then to make that a little bit lighter
I'm gonna go with my hourglass femme
nude lip steal Oh in number one nude and
then to make the lip a little bit softer
I'm just gonna take my pinky whoa god
damn what happened here and then to make
that lip a little bit softer I'm just
gonna use a finger and then just kind of
tap the edge to make it a little bit
more worn in and just natural and that
