August favorites um I haven't done my
favorites in like two months so I craved
just showing you stuff that I love so
today I'm gonna show you my August
favorites and it's not a lot but it is
stuff that I really really like as you
know I take my brows really seriously I
want my brows to look perfect I want my
brows to have like the perfect color the
perfect like blonde SG tone brows are
really really important to me so in the
past I always used to go to my neck
Omega because that was the closest to
what I thought would look good on me but
then a couple of weeks ago I came across
Anastasia brow powder is like brow stuff
she had gels powders pencil
everything and I came across the powder
in ash blonde taupe the brow powder duo
and it looks like this and I love the
packaging it is so it's like collabora
s-- and chic and elegant but not in a
cheap way I am NOT you these
are the best colors for Blondie's like
me I love this I love love love this I
tweeted about this and basically all I
can say about this brow powder is where
have you been oh god I wanted to look
mostess that you only need a really
really tiny bit this powder is pigmented
as hell and honestly I hate when people
say this but a little bit goes a long
long way so definitely go check out the
brow powders they have them in so many
different colors and shades and stuffs
so check it out then next are the OCC
concealers these are like Photoshop in a
little jar I've always been a huge fan
of OCC because they have great stuff
they have their lip tars and your
pigments and they all rock so when they
came out with their concealers I was
like basically it's my favorite
concealer ever you really only need the
tiniest amount and you can like cover up
any pimple that you have and it's so
pigmented like you only need a little
it and just dab it on and then blend the
edges and it's like where's the pimple
find the pimple I can't find it and the
plus side is they come in so many colors
they have a red toned and a yellow toned
section I'm the yellow tone one but look
at this this is our number five and it
is seriously such a dark color it's
amazing I have a shoot last month with
the dark model and all I used were the
skin concealers my OCC and her face
looked amazing the nexuses Makeup
Forever aqua cream in number 13 I kind
of stumbled across this I was shopping
with one of my colleagues slash best
friends we went to hormones and then we
went to Sephora and they had makeup
forever and I love their aqua cream
eyeshadows because they're so they're
pigmented and they stay on because
they're aqua they're waterproof and then
I came across number 13 and this is a
light champagne sort of rose gold color
it's gorgeous
like for darker skin people this just
pops like no other I personally use it
as a cheekbone highlight now and then or
it's just a really nice rose gold toned
color on the lid and it stays put so
well definitely recommend this NYX is
the face front
artistic pigment in vanilla creme on
artistic pigment in vanilla chrome this
is so gorgeous I use this as an inner
corner highlight and it is it makes you
look like a million bucks plus my mom
sells it and I want to talk about this
because so many of you asked does your
mom ship internationally yes she does
and then people ask what is owing euros
actually on the right side of the
website you have currency and you can
click British Pound you can click
dollars or Euros next is the Ben Nye
newtralizer cream crayon in the light
mp2 I've used this in so many tutorials
that I've never really included it in a
favorites video I don't know why but
this has got to be one of my all-time
favorite products I use it every day
wearing it today it just opens up your
eyes in such a natural way I never
really liked using white as my eyeliner
because it looks too stark and to you
fake for me but
it opens up your eyes and it makes you
look healthy and just fresh young from
ectis soiree
nail polish absolutely gorgeous wearing
it on my nails right now it is gorgeous
it just you only need two coats and I
expect it to like meet six it's just the
perfect like metallic bronze rose gold
goodness I've also been obsessing over
this perfect cover BB cream by Misha or
Misha number 21 because that's the
lightest shade I love to mix and match
products I do with eyeshadows lipsticks
foundations everything this along with
my Neutrogena Healthy Skin and my Mac
face and body those three together
perfect foundation mix I'm wearing it on
my skin today I love this BB cream um
I've tried the pink hot pink super BB
cream hated it because I was red and I
actually worried in a Rihanna tutorial
and I got so many hate for my skin now
one thing that has been a pain in my ass
this month was a sauce and not just this
month but like the entire year almost
I've been ordering so much stuff from a
sauce that it's actually kind of sick
I'm wearing this dress with like a fox
print and not like the their their skin
but the actual Fox so I have actual
foxes on me I just love everything about
ASOS like look at this necklace that I
got it's a rose gold spike necklace and
actually the like the top of the spikes
has rose gold rhinestones and I don't
know just it's just you could wear it
like a crown like a hipster then also I
want to do some announcements in October
I plan to do a video every other day and
I'm gonna call it Beauty over I asked on
Facebook like should I called it octi or
Butte Ober and many of you said that oxy
was made to spongebob I love spongebob
so in October I plan to do a video every
other day
just because I see other people do it
and I'm like and because October is so
much fun with like Halloween and stuff
so I was like perfect
and the first 15 days are going to be
like normal makeup tutorials and normal
tags and normal hauls and I don't know
what and then from the 15th to till the
31st
I'm gonna do Halloween tutorials and
then also Agatha I think that's it daddy
