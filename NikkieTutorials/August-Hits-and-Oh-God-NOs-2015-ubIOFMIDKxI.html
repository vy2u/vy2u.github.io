knows I truly cannot and I mean it with
my entire heart I cannot believe August
is over and done with it literally feels
like it was my birthday in March just
yesterday or the day before that so
throughout the month of August I
gathered up a couple of favorites that I
really want to share with you and of
course some oh god notes so without any
further ado let's do it yes but first
favorite of the month is actually
nothing beauty related or whatsoever
I've been wanting these little cutesy
guys for forever and then yesterday I
finally walked into one and it like hell
broke loose my new obsession are pop
vinyl figures I have one so far which is
the Heath Ledger Joker I mean oh my god
look at him he's holding a little Joker
he has awesome makeup on his hair is on
point weave is on point asked his on
point everything is on point I have an
obsession so a couple of weeks ago I
walked into a store and I wanted to buy
the Joker but Rick was like what no it's
useless and I was like but it's cute so
yesterday I walked into that store again
I still saw that the Joker was there I
was like I don't care what Rick says
today I'm gonna get it but I also
ordered a lot more and I already talked
about it on snapchat and so many of you
have shared your collections with me on
Twitter which was so awesome and so many
of you guys have so many of these I have
ordered
Cordelia Fox from American Horror Story
where she stabbed her eyes out Fiona
Goode with blood all over her face
twisty to clown my favorite a couple of
zombies from The Walking Dead
Daenerys Targaryen I got dancing baby
Groot I got um I got a key chain of Rick
Grimes from The Walking Dead because
then I have all the Rick's around me
Rick Rick Grimes all the Rick's and
believe it or not but Rick also ordered
a few and I was like didn't you hate
these a couple of weeks ago and now he
ordered Ted and Stewie Griffin dad this
is my latest obsession it has
nothing to do with beauty I'm just I'm
just so obsessed and it cannot wait to
show you the others I just talked about
once they come in love next up I got a
new curling iron by new me so my old one
my favorite old one was by Chi but that
one broke down so I was in need of
something new and then I got the Kroll
gem three-in-one buy new me and I love
this color so the new me Carl jam comes
with three 100% titanium interchangeable
barrels and it heats up to 210 Celsius
degrees and of course I got this set
because it has three interchangeable
100% titanium barrels you can change
them up you have the big one the small
one in the medium one my medium one is
the favorite I know I did not burn
myself it's off but you know what makes
this so awesome it also comes with the
straightening iron I sealed the deal for
me I just love how the curl Jam delivers
consistent and steady heat which makes
the curling your hair so much easier
it's one of the best curling irons and
straightening irons I have ever used it
has replaced my love for the Qi one
which is big because I've used to Chi
one for forever and I actually spoke to
new me and they were kind enough to give
me a couple of coupon codes for you all
because I know you guys love discounts
so if you use the code it's Nikki you
will get $100 off any curling set so
that could be the curl jam that can be
the titanium set any curling set you
want you will get $100 off and for the
code Nikki loves beauty you'll get 40%
off the entire website plus if you live
in Holland like I do you will get $12
shipping off I just think that are some
great discount codes new me hooked you
up I try to hook you up so go ahead and
enjoy those discount codes and I highly
recommend the curl champ my next
favorite is by it cosmetics and this is
the bye bye under-eye in the color light
I tried this a couple of weeks ago on my
channel I absolutely fell in love with
it like no other it has replaced my love
for the pro longwear by Mac it has
replaced II love for the urban decay
naked skin concealer by my under-eye is
everything you could wish for in a
concealer it is so high coverage it
creates this flower
looking based on your face one of the
best concealers I have ever tried in my
career in my life I highly recommend you
buy buy under eye and no I do not only
use it for under my eye I use it to
conceal and highlight other places of my
face it's the bomb you only need a
little bit because it's so so so
covering it's amazing and eyeshadow I
don't think I've really featured in a
favorites video before but I'm obsessed
with is the prismatic I should have by
NYX and this is in the color Girl Talk
and I've shown this in my previous video
where I show you how to highlight for
pale skin I talked about it there how
much I love this one but I don't think
I've ever featured it in a favorites
video which is weird so this is the
prismatic eye shadow in Girl Talk and it
has a little bit more of a champagne
rose gold feel and I'm wearing it as a
highlighter on my face today and I just
love the way it looks on pale skin and
medium skin probably as well but if you
get a little bit darker than medium skin
it's too light it will look too chrome
on you but I mean come on look at the
glow look at the glow nurse going on
here I absolutely love this I love it
for on the lids highlighting the face in
your corners decolletage I'm obsessing
over this color it's absolutely
beautiful I love it
as you know I'm a huge fan of Natasha de
Nonna eyeshadows and Natasha actually
contacted me and I'm so honored that she
knows who I am
so Natasha de Nonna offered me to send
her all her eye shadows and I low-key
lost my because I love her eyes
shadows and so I got two of these
pellets right here I'm wearing all
Natasha de nanã eyeshadows today look
at this oh my god oh my god oh my god
we're not there yet we're not there yet
oh god I cannot deal with my life right
now I can't hunt with my life right now
I think Natasha de Nonna eyeshadows are
one of the best eyeshadows on the market
one of the best eyeshadows ever created
because they all have this amazing
luminance to it it has a sparkle in the
shine when it's not too much and it just
looks goddamn amazing on the eyes
they're just so good I just think the
Natasha Donna eyes shadow czar once you
actually
you really have to try out because
they're so so good so if you end up
trying them out please let me know send
me tweets messages instagrams
post whatever just let me know that you
are on the Natasha don't own a boat
because that boat deserves to be stood
on positively my next hit is my tweezer
men and this is the contour foundation
brush and I showed this oh god also in
the pale contour video I really really
like this brush for regular foundation
application because this brush is so
dense and so high-quality that if you
use the littlest bit of foundation it
just grabs all the maximum coverage from
that foundation and just makes it so
flawless all your face it's not not not
normal I don't know how and I don't know
why but this brush is able to get the
maximum coverage out of any product that
you use with it it's just so dense it
just glides over the face so nicely I
love the way my skin looks with it I'm
wearing it I used it for my foundation
today I love it I highly recommended and
tweezerman came out with brushes which
is really nice next up I want to talk
about a perfume that Chloe Morello
actually got me hooked on this is C by
Chloe and this is the Eau de Parfum
parfum multi by Chloe is what Chloe was
wearing when I first met her in real
life and she came over to Holland and
neatly my kind of creepy stalker side
when like so by day 2 or 3 I don't
remember I took all my courage and asked
her which scent she was wearing and she
told me it was C by Chloe
we went out to get it for me that next
hour and ever since Chloe has left
Holland I've been wearing this because
it reminds me of her and but also just
reminds me how delicious it smells and
it's just such a nice flowery wait let
me do a description again it smells like
a mysterious game of hide and seek in
the gardens the flowery gardens of
Braavos while Tyrion Lannister is
chasing
it smells amazing my last hit of the
month is actually a TV show which I've
totally gone into and I cannot stop
watching it and talking about face off
and face off is a show where a couple of
contestants about 10 or 12 or 11 or 13
they come together and they all are
specialized in special-effects makeup in
the show every week they get different
challenges and they have to create their
own special effects creation and it is
so inspiring the judges are people I've
looked up to you for so long now V Neil
who did the Hunger Games spider-man who
did any possible cool makeup in
Hollywood you could think of Glenn
Hetrick
I love his vibe I love how cutthroat he
is and he is so talented plus also he's
a custom designer for Lady gaga
whom I also love and Neville page and
Neville page
that Prometheus and prometheus is one of
my favorite movies because of the makeup
so every week someone wins and someone
goes home and I'm at season 3 episode 6
right now it is such a great and
inspiring show if you ever feel like in
you're an inspirational rut you just
have to watch this show and after one
episode you feel all these ideas in your
mind and you want to play with makeup
and even if you've never tried special
effects makeup like I have you want to
get into it you want to start sculpting
and and creating silicone and creating
creatures and it's so inspiring and I
love it so I highly recommend you
checking faceoff out so those were my
hits for the month of August I only have
one oh god no for you and this month
that is again
I know the mac studio conceal and
correct duo in lights I got this
it looked so promising to me because it
has a more peachy pinky side to
counteract any darkness or blueness you
may have got going on on your face and
it's got a very yellowy side to really
highlight and bringing light to the face
now I tried this a couple of times and
every time I did not see it doing
anything on my face the pinky side
doesn't really correct all that much it
just wipes away really easily and the
yellow side doesn't really bring
brightness to my face at all so every
time I would use this I'd be like why am
I actually including this step when it's
not doing anything and because it's a
pretty pricey product I do not want
people to get this and feel like it's
really doing something for them because
it's probably not now of course if you
like this product and you have a way of
making this work then definitely let me
know in the comment section down below
because I would love for this to work
because it looks so promising but it's
not doing anything for me so that's it
guys that were my headset 'god knows for
the month of a wig I have one more I
have one more I got Victoria Beckham 18
carats gold sunglasses also because of

max so thank you guys so much for
