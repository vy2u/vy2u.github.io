my no I just kind of stopped doing that
intro when I do my head synagogue knows
I'm gonna come up with an intro some
time it is time it is worse intro song
ever hey guys welcome to my office
it said 'god knows i know that every
guru on youtube does this where they're
like in their favorite city it's like oh
my gosh this must flew by i sort of say
that sometimes and sometimes i just say
it because i want to say it but this
month like august look who by i was just
checking my phone and i'm filming this
in advance it is the 29th right now holy
 how did it get this far how is it
the 29th already like my mind so out of
it
I have a couple of fun products for you
and a couple of fun Oh God knows for you
so without any further ado let's go if
you're gonna ask me about my makeup this
again is for a fashionista magazine this
will be here in about half a year now
this is for like Edition number
gazillion trillions haha I'm such a so
the first thing I wanted to show you are
my say somebody foundations by Mac and
now you're gonna be like you showed that
so many times we get it I learned this
new appliance technique from Sharon
Pharrell am I saying that right here on
YouTube she is an amazing guru she's
just uh I love her makeup tutorials so
much and she came up with this way of a
pie face and body to the palm of your
hands and then keep rubbing it until you
feel that the face of body kind of
becomes sticky is sort of like rough and
that is when you apply it with your
hands all over your face and then just
Pat it in I've always loved face my body
but I always have that sort of like
struggle with it that it didn't like
became opaque immediately it just became
a peg affair like
ten minutes and with this technique you
just apply to the palm of your hands to
keep rubbing in it till it gets rough
and then you apply it and you have like
the most amazing coverage ever it just
covers everything it's still really
natural and it's not like like a layer
of foundation it just blends in so
beautifully so Sharon thank you so much
for this tip because it saved my life
going a little bit to words the taking
care of my skin I've showed you guys
this before this is the Hannah opulence
serum I just love this so much it is so
hydrating moisturizing and the best
thing is this opulence serum by Hannah
it kind of reduces veins or red spots or
just spots in your face gradually it
takes care of it and after using this a
week or maybe three days even you can
really see your complexion clearing up
and I love this so much and yes I'm
gonna go there my mom sells this in her
web shops she has it's ghost maze guys
on Enel and for my duchies she has heads
Hama has done an L what is next is so
beautiful and it's so out of this world
but still I'm afraid to use it this is
the Lancome blush in a rose gazelle
illuminating smooth powder just look at
the packaging alone we have Paris with
lips and roses in Lancome wait for it
this is a beautiful blush with like
Paris and roses literally imprinted on
it and then you have this shiny chrome
pink lip oh it's just so amazing the
problem is I do not ever want to use
this because oh look at that imprint oh
my God look at that then next up I have
this Kiko color spare eyeshadow it's
sort of like those baked eyeshadows that
every brand has nowadays but the Kegel
ones are kind of different they're more
glittery and more sparkly and when you
say glittery and sparkly you say Nicky
number four and this is the most amazing
bronzy sort of Ambar sort of natural
shiny color I love this I've used to
know so many people nowadays I've used
it on a client for for like the lottery
some people one millionaire for a day
and then I had to do a makeover on this
middle-aged woman and I was like do you
love shimmer she was like I lost you
Marissa I was like I'm gonna apply this
I applied it wet to her eyelids looked
stunning she was so happy so this is a
true winner these are the gemstone
collection diamond effects powder
pigments and these three little guys we
use all the time I work in a agency and
makeup and hair agency um and we get
hired to do the cover cover girls for
million eons for my Dutch cheese we also
do Holland's Next Top Model we do quite
a lot of stuff for TV and these three
starters right here are always in our
camps because they sued everybody this
is Sunstone which is a gorgeous copper
color we use this on dark skin all the
time because it looks stunning on dark
skin and then we have Sunstone which is
a sort of gold
peachy shiny chrome color this is
stunning and then also special diamond
number three and this is a really nice
pink duochrome so it's a white powder
but with a pink duochrome so when you
hit the light you have a really nice
pink red duochrome shiny color it's
awesome I've also been loving this Mac
the looks pearl pearl fusion shadow quad
shadow palette whatever these are all
Velux pearl shadows and they're shimmery
they're glittery they're shiny they're
Cromie are amazing these aren't great
it's like a topper so if you have a nice
eye shadow look and you want some
sparkle and pizzazz in there then you
can just take one of these two colors
and go over top and then you have a
really nice glittery lid okay two more
hits
I have Opie eyes Galore
liquid sand I love this I did a whole
blog post review on it on my blog I will
put the link down in the infobox
Galore all over my damn hands
I love Galore and if you're a Bond
fan you know that Galore is from
Goldfinger from James Bond no I did not
know that naturally I looked it up on
the internet because I do not like James
Bond one bit not even Skyfall talking
about Skyfall I watched this movie
because everyone was like it's a batch
James Bond movie ever spoiler alert this
the entire movie is about saving this
old lady which I do not know her name
and then the entire movie is about her
getting chased and bonds rescuing her
and then at the end of the goddamn movie
she dies two and a half hours of my life
wasted why make an entire movie of
rescuing somebody and then let them die
and they'll let folder more beads I knew
her last up is ISA Hans manifesto
perfume Alex dear Oh de Parfum intense
yes right here it's like I imagine like
Adam and Eve
I imagine Eve smelling like this back in
the day the bottle is absolutely
stunning I love the purple and then it
gradually going to a darker blue and
then the smell oh it's so unworldly it's
so out of this planet it's so intense so
good it's I imagine just like goddesses
smelling like this like if you go to
like the Greek goddesses calendar I
smell this so the time has come enough
love spread for this video it's time to
get dishing it's time for the hits that
were just announced and now it's time
for the oh god knows oh yeah
no first oh god no this month is my
tailbone and I call it the tailbone
terrors because if you follow me on
Twitter you've been in for a ride
basically long story short is that I
always thought that I had bruised my
tailbone turned out to be a cyst a
political sister or something and they
cut it open and they had to push all the
 out and then
I have this open cut in between my butt
cheeks right now and that has to heal
and then in a couple of weeks I have to
go back they cut it open again and then
they take like the source of the plot
pull it in all sister
and then I'm saved
from the tailbone terrors hand girl no
Miley Cyrus at the VMAs and I'm gonna
stop right there I think the time I we
got that haircut they must have like
gotten to her brain or something and
that concludes my August hit Sarah God
