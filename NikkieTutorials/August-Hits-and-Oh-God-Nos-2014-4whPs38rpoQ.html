to I just filmed the tutorial before
this then it didn't even bother to
change my clothes because normally when
I do two videos a day I just changed my
clothes act like I didn't film it on the
same day but today I'm not even gonna
bother because I am loving this cardigan
but today it's time to do my oddest hits
and God knows and I am late anyways I
have a few hits to share with you this
month and of course and oh god no so
buckle up get ready because we're gonna
go I want to talk about a product that
has been featured on my channel a lot of
times but I've never actually featured
it in a favorites video I am talking
about Chanel Leblanc and you've seen
this come around in video so many times
as a base and I just love it I there
isn't really much I can say about it
because it's an it's a base it's
illuminating it's an illuminating base
which helps make makeup that you put on
top look really good and lasts longer
and give you a nice finish it makes
makeup that you put on top look flawless
it just gives you that illuminating
glowing base and I like mixing it with
my shimmering skin perfectors from Becca
to get that really nice you know perfect
base to work with so I figured I've
never featured it in hit synagogue no so
I was like this is the time to do it
it's a great base something I've
recently bumped into is the NYX dewy
finish a setting spray and I got this in
Malaga and I will have a haul coming up
in a couple of days weeks about all the
stuff I bought in Malaga which is going
to be huge but it did quickly want to
tell you guys that the NYX dewy finish a
long lasting setting spray is absolutely
perfect I sprayed it on my face today
and I just think that it really does
give your face a really nice dewy finish
I did a show yesterday with Joyce in
intersex and I actually use this as a
mixing medium for some of the pigments
that we use for the look as well so not
only is it a great setting spray for a
nice
we finish it's also a great mixing
medium another brush I've been loving
lately and especially yesterday at that
show is the real techniques a little
expert face brush and I also got this
because of Joyce she's been using this
for so long and this is the brush I use
for contouring all my models and on
myself now too as of today and I started
contouring my models with it and it's
just it was so easy and quick and
perfect that I was like this morning I
was like okay let's do it on my face
today on my face not author faces so
this is an absolute great brush for
contouring you can use it for foundation
concealer you can use it for whatever
but I especially particularly love it
for contouring next is the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector pressed in
moonstone I mentioned this in a haul I
recently did and I finally tried it and
I put it on my models yesterday I'm
wearing it as my glow today oh my god
this is so beautiful and pretty and it
just looks so good on so many skin tones
you not you shouldn't be too dark
because then it will look ashy but for
like fair to medium skin tones this is
out of this world out of the park out of
the temple tutorials it's insane I love
it so much I mean just look at this
business right here also a huge hit this
month was by uh Nastasia Beverly Hills
and this is the clear brow gel and I got
this recently because I really wanted to
try more products from Anastacio and
I've really fallen in love with the
brand whereas before I didn't really
have that connection with it it's a brow
gel it's clear and I love brow gels
because when I'm not wearing any makeup
I curl my lashes and I put brow gel in
my brows to make them stay in place to
look pretty and just this brow gel is so
hardcore it does make your brow hairs a
little bit on the you know crunch your
side but it's a good crunch
it makes your brow hairs stay in place
like a mofo they don't move they don't
budge your brows will stay in place all
day long I love this I recently received
the Sigma steady
low collection and in this collection
are pigments and I believe that pigments
are something new to Sigma and I've been
loving Sigma in and of itself recently
but these pigments are a whole new level
the three pigment said I love from the
steady glow collection our midsummer
which is on the lid today then I also
really really love gilded which is on
the middle of the lid today and then
this crazy color which is called lush it
has copper but then once you you know
move it a little bit it becomes pink and
then red and it's just I love duo chrome
pigments like that that look copper in
one light pink and the other and when
you have a combination of those lights
they're like pink and copper and you're
like what the hell man so the pigments
by Sigma are a great addition to their
collection and definitely check out the
steady globe collection because I am
loving that one you have a pallid in it
which has my name written all over it
I want to talk about this lipstick this
glamor lipstick by Illamasqua
it's called tease you have seen this on
my channel a couple of times now because
it's just such a darn good nude it's
like the perfect nude but like very nude
lip color for fair skin tone people out
there okay we're almost at last hit for
the month it's got a little bit of a
story this is the swatch cough got to be
glued extreme freeze hairspray I watch a
lot of RuPaul's Drag Race a lot and I
just I'm a drag queen fanatic I love
everything about drag queens and what
they do and my number one rule is when a
drag queen uses a product you know it's
one gonna last - it's going to look
great on stage and three is just it's
meant to stay that way because drag
queens perform and they sweat and they
move and they do a lot of stuff so I was
walking down the aisle of hairsprays in
the drugstore and I always see this
bright neon yellow hairspray popping up
with the drag queens and I looked down
the aisle and I was like this hairspray
right here is
but so many drag queens used to keep
their hair intact to not make it but to
make it stay in place and oh my gosh I
have fallen in love with this damn
hairspray if you tease your hair and you
spray the t's with this that T's will
stay in the entire freakin day and just
when you have like a nice owns in there
and you want it to stay pumped
throughout the entire day just spritz
spritz spritz your hair stays like that
and it's fantastic it smells good
I love the neon yellow if you're on the
hunt for eight extreme yet still
manageable and not too crunchy hairspray
that you know keeps hair in place gotta
have this so that's it for all my hips
for the month of August let's go on to
the yacht yeah oh yeah no my one and
only oh god no this month is also a
hairspray and I have been a Loreal
Elnett agate junkie it was my life
support I could not live without L meds
until recently they came out with a new
addition which is the Loreal Elnett
extra strength
Beck combed a volume volume excess
hairspray normally when a brand comes
out with something new they've worked
really hard along on it so it must be
good I tried this this does not have
hold or whatsoever it stings l net has
that really nice classic scent to it but
this just smells like like it has
diarrhea it just it doesn't work it
doesn't hold hair it doesn't hold back
home to teased parts and when you want
to you know do something with the hair
you spritz this in you do this and it's
out it's gone it's just it's it's gunk
you don't need this in your life what
were your hits in a God knows this month
