collab with a whole lot of other
different gurus here on YouTube we're
doing the real life Disney Princesses
sort of collab we have so many girls and
we decided to come up with this collab
to be the real life Disney Princesses so
we have Ariel we have Jane we have Belle
I think we almost have them all and
today I am the Sleeping Beauty I am
Aurora and I hope you could tell because
if you couldn't tell my job today was a
big s feel I watched a movie this
morning to kind of get my inspiration
flowing and I love this movie make your
blue make it pink and I love testing
with the fairies are like it's awful
that's because it's how you dear
she is lutely love the Sleeping Beauty
and today I decided to recreate my
aurora look definitely go check out all
the other beauty gurus as well and all
the info is down below and on my website
and yeah if you want to know how to get
this really wearable but very Disney
like look then please keep on watching
so the first thing we're gonna do as
always is apply base to the eyelids to
prevent the eyeshadow from creasing and
I'm using more one thing they didn't
give me a life is the ability to sing
they just forgot about that one first
I'm gonna use these two shades those two
keys diem
I'm gonna take those two shades from my
face aren't eyeshadow palette in number
one and this is to define my crease so
just start defining the outer part of
your crease with this and then work your
way to the middle now taking these two
shades from that same palette I'm gonna
continue defining the inner part of my
crease and then I'm just gonna blend
that out and up and up and out to make
it softer taking those same two shades
I'm gonna define my lower lash line just
for the outer third for now and then
connect this lower part
with the part in your crease so it kind
of just goes out straight out of the
lower lashline and then connected to
your crease oh oh now you just want to
give everything a really nice and smooth
blend and you kind of want this part to
be very blended and going outwards so
that's making it sort of extreme but it
still looks sort of natural in a Disney
kind of way all them girls in Disney all
them princesses were a shitload of
makeup we just didn't see because they
drew it on okay now from this Inglot
palette I'm gonna take this sort of rose
gold bronze color and I don't know the
number but I will put that on my blog
and that's just going all over the
eyelid for my inner corner I'm gonna
take a bit of this Inglot shadow right
here which is a really nice sort of
champagne gold color and then I'm gonna
take my makeup studio jewel effects and
shine and apply that wet to my inner
corners as well okay now I'm gonna take
my Ben Nye neutralizer cream crayon and
apply that to my wedded lines for an
even more opened
I sort of princess Disney look and then
I'm gonna curl my lashes apply mascara
and the mascara is I'm using our my
makeup studio waterproof 3 DX or black
and the ultimate curl and then because I
said I wanted more of like Disney sort
of eye I'm gonna apply some individual
lashes and these are by Mac and these
are number 30s and I'm just gonna place
them we duchies would call it head-on
there here and there I'm just gonna play
some here and there and once you're
drying gonna put another layer of
mascara on top just to give them more of
Disney okay for cheeks I first want to
contour the crap out of my face because
I ate too much chocolate already and the
holidays haven't even started yet so
contour it is then warming up my face a
little bit more with my illamasqua blush
in disobey
for blush I'm going to use this
illamasqua blush in naked rose and then
there's a highlight I'm going to make a
mixture between my Mac soft and gentle
mineralized skinfinish and this sort of
highlighting color by Inglot that I used
for my inner corners as well it's this
one so I'm just gonna mix it till and
just highlight your face with that if
firming lips I'm going to use this
L'Oreal caress lipstick in number seven
and this is cheeky magenta and just put
that on ooh that is a lot brighter than
I thought it would be and take your
finger and blend it in and that guys
completes my take on my real life Disney
character I'm Aurora Sleeping Beauty but
I'm not sleeping right now I hope you
