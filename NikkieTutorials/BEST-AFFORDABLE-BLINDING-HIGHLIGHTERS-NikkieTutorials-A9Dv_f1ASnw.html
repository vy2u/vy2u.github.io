do you see now for those of you about to
comment at keiki mess leave a pill
should that need Summer Sun true
there is actually there true when you
look at my face there's one thing
clearly missing beauty I'm kidding I'm
kidding I'm in Phase two okay I'll stop
when you look at my face there's one
thing clearly missing highlighter a lot
of it I am looking very matte I'm
wearing a full match I look the space is
looking dusty and in need of some love
and I did this because in today's video
everybody we're going to check out my
favorite top favorite blinding
highlighter these are literally the most
brightening blinding intense
highlighters that I know that are
affordable and I know everybody out
there loves a good deal so yeah I think
my body is just in such a big need of
glow that I'm missing my words so let's
go let's blow let's do it the first
highlighter is by MUA and this is called
the strobe and glow highlight kit and
this is in the colored pink luster and I
like this because when you open it up
there is a large container of a pink
toned blinding highlight now this Ridge
here is a part of highlight but when you
flip it up there's actually a cream
highlight as well personally cream
highlighters and I don't go together so
I keep it like this but this highlight
is stunning if you are on the hunt for a
pinky toned highlighter that is
affordable and blinding look no more
it's right here I'm actually going to be
applying it on one of my cheek and for
this today I'm going to go as always
with my ramos number two kabuki brush
this brush gets highlighter on so
perfectly I talked about it in my June
hits and oh god no so if you haven't
seen that yet definitely go check it out
it's in the screen somewhere right here
and I'll explain fully why I love this
brush this brush is Boehm alright I've
seriously been Q Matt and dull for too
long let's let's go they're in it up
I need more I always need more in case
of highlighter Mars more so as you can
see it is a stunning pink toned
highlighter very intense very bright and
this just hits the spot so if you're
looking for something like this look no
more you found it next up is another mu
a highlighter this is in the same line
as the pink one this one is called the
set and reflect finishing kits in white
gold and what I like about this is that
the texture up top looks so cool so what
I'm seeing is a shimmering white with
specks of gold and when you mix the two
you get a beautiful shimmering soft gold
color now I think this is a little too
gold for the look I'm going for today so
I won't be applying this to my face
today but let me tell you when you are
looking for a more golden glow look no
more your journey has come to an end now
with this one when you flip it up it
doesn't have a cream highlighter it
actually has a invisible setting powder
it really dig into that portion but I've
definitely fallen in love with the gold
I just think it looks so good and for
something that is affordable this is an
absolute must
next up let's go to the world of color
pop color pop highlighters are known to
be super blinding they have a strong
cult following and the first one I want
to talk about right here is called lunch
money and it is a soft goldish champagne
nude color this is it is strong and
intense and light but somehow on the
skin when you blend it in it becomes a
little bit more natural of course now
you can fill it up or tap it in so it
gets more coverage but this one is a
little bit softer now if you aren't numb
with the color pop super shocked cheeks
these are like almost like a putty like
a cream splash putty splash it's almost
like a little with a soft wet ish
marshmellow if you've never tried color
pop before this is what I would describe
it as but Y all means in the comments
down below let me know what you would
describe it as but it's it's not creamy
it's not powder it's like a little
cushion so I like this one for all my
softer days so again won't be applying
this but this is a beautiful beautiful
steel and I believe these are six or
eight dollars so what I will be applying
is another color pop super shock cheek
highlighter this is in the color
flexitarian when I first got my hands on
this I thought this was a metallic
eyeshadow it's bad line name just when
you see it in the pan and you move it
around in the light you can see how
reflective it is like it is here to
scorch eyes just like do you see that I
can do this for hours just see that it's
like I can send signals to the moon with
this so this right here has that same
same weird feel as all the other car
problems look at this now this is of
course if you can you know me this is
what I live for
now if you don't like something as
strong go with lunch money or apply this
to the lid inner corners tip of the nose
to really get that beacon of light going
just go as far as you feel like going so
picking some up on my brush I swear to
God at the end of this video I'm going
to look like I did a take two of the
full face using only highlighters
challenge
now probably my favorite thing of the
colour-pop highlighters is that they're
because they're not a powder they're not
laying on top of the skin they really
blend in and become part of the skin
when you want to look for a highlighter
that really goes into the skin and gives
it that very lips look without laying on
top of it and like looking artificial
although I mean I mean this is kind of
our basal you know what I'm saying
when you're looking for a highlighter
that's really going to blend in like
magic go for the color pop wands they
just stay they blend so beautifully like
they're traceless you know while I'm at
it
just let me add some to this libraries
here because like I want to match it up
a little bit and like oh god oh and
another trick for if you wanted to be
even more blinding use the color pop
ones as a base put a powder one over top
oh my god oh my god alright next on the
list is this one by makeup revolution
this one is called this is actually an
eye shadow now let me tell you if you're
new to makeup don't ever let someone
tell you that I should or should be used
to shadows like lipstick should be as a
lipstick only there are no rules to
makeup so if you want to use a
highlighter as an eye shadow do it if
you want to use a bronzer as a contour
shade in your eye socket do it there are
no rules
so same goes for this right here this is
my makeup revolution and it's a mono
eyeshadow in the color base exclamation
base Beyonce help me sir Carter and room
we are already more talented that I will
ever be this is the this is one of
the most blinding soft drugstore eye
shadows I've ever tried in my life I'll
be applying it to the tip of my nose and
the bridge of my nose today because I
love it for that it's nice and
reflective it's blinding it's going to
hit all the right spots just you wait
and see to blow the nose
Oh see that okay bridge suited bridge I
think this one is my favorite because
this is like $2 it's pretty much $2 you
I mean you can use this on your lids in
the corners wherever you can we are
going there I mean my non-existent
collarbones definitely need a little bit
of lovin with this yes they're really
non-existent when I said normally but
like when I try every now and then it
pops up and I feel really great upon
myself next is an oldie but a goodie
this is my morphe and this is a pressed
pigment in the color champagne nice if
you've been a longtime follower you have
seen this make quite a few appearances
on my channel before this is very
affordable very pretty like very pretty
excellent evidence I feel like at the
end of this video every Tigers going to
start looking the same but also very
light reflective this also has a pink
shine to it so it's more comparable to
the first color I showed you by anyway
and I feel like a lot of people can have
easy access to more fees so I just
wanted to include it it's an oldie but a
goodie and it's still gorgeous so why
not include it here okay actually
there's an enough glow my face right now
I kind of want to strobe my forehead and
my chin so I'm going back in with lunch
money by color puffs like I said this is
a little bit more saucepan I'm just
going to hit this portion right here oh
God okay and this will give me a very
lit slash almost oily look from within I
personally really like it because I feel
like it makes me look a little bit more
oh my god is going to say it natural and
then also tiny bit on the chin to get
the glow going oh my god I am looking
very intense right now but living
alright last - this one right here is a
pigment so this can be used for
eyeshadow and like again inner corners
all over body you can do this you know
whatever you want with this this is my
Helen e it's a shimmer eye powder and
the color
sixteen this is out of all of these the
most blinding one because it is a
pigment and if you like wit pigments is
all very intense and very blinding so if
you're a daredevil out there who really
wants to stand out from the crowd at
like a party or your first day or like
to church or like something in the
grocery shopping if you really want to
bolide go for a pigment because you can
really add on the intensity because you
can add as much want and this one right
here is stunning but it's not for those
of you that have a weak heart because it
will make your heart run faster last but
certainly not least is this Maybelline
shadow palette this is called the city
mini palette and the color
rooftop bronzes now this in and of
itself is a stunning eyeshadow palette
real quick this color on the lid this is
a beautiful palette with shimmering
bronzes and like luxurious like glam
shades but this color right here if you
have more medium skin tone this is going
to do things for you honey it's more
golden and warm so it's not going to
necessarily look great on my fair skin
tone so for me this isn't going to work
but with anyone with a more medium skin
tone bomb and I think that wraps up my
list of all of the blinding highlighters
and my favorites that I gravitate
towards when I'm not using ever glow and
of course to make any highlight melt
into the skin it looks flawless and
traces you need setting spray so that
wraps up this video guys please sound

of these is your favorites do you own
one of these do you use them to
highlight do you use them for your eyes
