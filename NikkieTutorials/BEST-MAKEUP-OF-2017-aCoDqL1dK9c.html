hello so today is not a winter wonder
week video because winter one a week
ended last week and I took a little bit
of a break and got to my creative juices
flowing back into the body it sounds so
weird I got my creative juices back and
I am back on the channel after a very
short four five day break five day four
day five day break hello I'm back so I
wanted to ring in the New Year I wanted
to ring in 2018 with my 2017 all-time
favorite hits
of the year so these are the products
that may 2017 even better I mean I
recorded a video with Jessie J Kim
Kardashian and Patrick Starr in 2017 so
2017 was pretty lit if you ask me but
these products that I have laying on my
on my lap right now my lab these
products that I am holding right here
really made a difference for 2017 and
really improved the makeup in 2017 for
me so today is all about that and I
tried to make the list not too too long
because I want it to be very very
selective these are products that if you
run out and buy them after this video I
wholeheartedly agree with and totally
support also you don't want to miss the
end of this video because if you're
ready I am ready I no longer have a cute
intro like which one a week so um let's
go alright the first product that I
really like is no shock to anyone I've
been watching love island and it's it's
so much fun I look like Hannah right now
alright so the first product I really
wanted to mention in this video is of
course this one right here I talked
about this a lot in the later part of
2017 this is amazing cosmetics aluminate
primer highlighter in the color Glo this
is a primer that gives you a glow we
finish this will give you that very
luminous dewy skin look and I just
applied it for that because I thought it
was gonna be really really good for an
Instagram video because you
thumbnails and I noticed that I kept
going back to this because I noticed
that my skin looked really flawless her
up the day and like it kept my oils at
bay
and it just made my face look really
flawless and perfectly set off
throughout the day and it totally kept
it that way so as soon as I didn't use
this I was like something's I'm missing
a little bit of life in the skin I'm
missing that longevity like it really
improved the longevity of my makeup and
yeah ever since I can't put it down I
love it so much it's so so pretty they
do come in more color so if glow is too
light for you they do come in a couple
of different colors as well this one is
a must another primer that I really want
to mention here is by Becca this is
called the Becca velvet blurring primer
perfecting base in the car apricot haze
this on my t-zone keeps me in lock all
day when I first tried this product I
was like this one because it's so drying
I have dry combination skin dry face
oily t-zone I wanted to try this to keep
the oils in my t-zone at bay and at
first it was so it's such a velvety dry
finish that I was like oh my god it's
gonna enhance every dry patch on my face
put this on your t-zone to control the
oils and this will control the oils and
it will keep your makeup looking
flawlessly until you take it off right
for fun - lets just blast through it
because we all know how much I love the
hood of beauty foe filter foundation
this just captivated my heart and never
let go and like roast it with Jack the
NARS mm-hmm
soft matte complete concealer in the
light one is just whatever color you are
this concealer has saved my under eyes I
used to go in with really really creamy
rich creamy like rich and creamy
concealer underneath my eyes and
throughout the day I would notice that
if I was wearing eyeliner or mascara it
would stamp onto my concealer because
basically officially even though I said
it and I baked my under eye my under eye
was too oily and too rich with product
that didn't really settle in
this is a matte concealer so it's not as
wet and this I noticed that it just it
completely conceals everything like any
flaw any darkness gone it has a
beautiful sort of skin texture once you
blend it into your skin it just it looks
so much like perfectly flawless
Photoshop skin that I cannot put this
down I need this under my eyes I put
this on my t-zone I do this pretty much
ever I could do my entire face with this
and ever since I moved away from the
more wet concealers to this more dry
matte one changed my under eye game like
no more eyeliner stamp enos going on
like no more mascara droopiness going on
no more black stains I looked I look all
day long this concealer oh oh my god if
you do not have this concealer what are
we even doing here Mac select cover-up
in nw15 this to cut the crease to cut
the lid to cut the brow to brighten the
under-eye the concealer for all you
creative Souls out there want to carve
out that brow boom now forgive the plot
twist want an eyeshadow base that isn't
an eyeshadow base boom this right here
I've been using this as my eyeshadow
base because I saw Paige Louise do this
on Instagram and a lot of UK artists
have been using this to like cut the lid
cut the crease they've also been using
it as an eyeshadow base and I was like
wait how it's a concealer it's gonna
crease and somehow when you Pat this
into the skin so instead of buffing it
into the skin you pat pat pat pat pat
pat pat pat pat that brush it sort of
dries this concealer and transforms it
into an eyeshadow base so I've been
using this as an eyeshadow base even
today it totally clears up any flaws it
gets you nice bright and flawless and it
stays there all day long I love it this
powder has been with me for so long in
2017 and I'm never letting go this right
here the oh okay let me do that again
this right here the Maybelline fit me
loose powder in Oh 5 this for my fair
people out there to bake your under eyes
with is a dream come true
it's a
that looks so good on the skin when you
bake with it it just melds into the skin
and you brush it away and boom
flawlessness crazily enough I don't use
it just at my entire face usually I only
do my t-zone and under eyes with it to
bake and really brighten but I should
probably get a ten this is o five I
should probably get a ten to set the
rest of my face with but this powder is
bomb and it's affordable and I love that
oh my god this is for breaths ever since
I did a video on this I haven't put this
down and my brow game has transformed I
did a first impressions video on this
iconic what does this even called sculpt
and boost eyebrow cushion I did a full
video on this if you want to see my
first impression on it I've been mixing
the two colors together so there's no
longer like a line and like the
difference of colors and you said two
colors together this for the brows is
everything that stays on all day long it
gives you amazing precision I love the
color this is in the color medium and
just I love the brow cushion I think the
brown cushion is awesome it gives me so
much precision it gives me so much
control so much power when it comes to
the brows and once it sets it sets if
you haven't noticed yet when I do my
makeup I want it to last until the earth
is destroyed when I do my makeup I want
it to last until cockroaches crawl over
this list is already longer than I ever
planned on it being so I'm so sorry in
advance see when it comes to eyes
shadows it's really hard because makeup
brands have literally come out with a
trillion and one new makeup palettes in
2017 and it's really hard to like
pinpoint exactly which one like stole
your heart there is one eye shadow that
I've been so obsessed with and I use it
pretty much every time I wear makeup I'm
wearing it on my inner corners it's by a
fairly unknown brand let me actually
grab the shadow from
this right here is a shimmering white
gold shadow and it's by Melchior
cosmetics this color is called festive
gold this hmm
this on the brow bone this on the inner
corner this as a highlighter on your
skin is everything that golden dreams
are made of
I love this color so much like ever
since I got my hands on that color it's
been on my inner corner it's been a
crease it's been on my face to highlight
it's it goes everywhere with me
but like the formula of the powder is
very creamy super super pigmented and
very easy to work with
my favorite part being that Melchior is
super super affordable
Melkor has so many shadows out there and
a lot of the UK artists use this to do
their shadows with and it's just packed
with pigment packed with blendability
these are some of the best shadows on
the market out there but if I have to
pinpoint one shadow that keeps making me
happy every time I use it it's festive
gold like I use it today to brighten up
this very natural look at least natural
for me and it just it makes me so happy
and it gets me in a mood and and I feel
like a lot of people should feel what
this shadow does took me what it will do
okay moving on this is also no surprise
this came out fairly late in 2017 but
this has been my favorite Julia's
palette Julia's place palette of 2017
when it first came out my good my I saw
the previews and I was like oh I love it
but you're only gonna use it like five
times I was so wrong this color right
here is as the softest definition in my
crease and outer corner today this color
right here is bomb for highlighting
inner corners and brow bone and sort of
like what festive gold does this one
right here on the lid oh my god this
color for a party oh my god this color
for a night out oh my god this for more
definition in the crease and more warmth
basically the only color I haven't
dipped in much into is the green because
I hate green shadow but that's about it
I've been using my palette so much it's
been going everywhere with me and you
can do the softest of soft with it
you can also do the brightest and
colorful zuv brightest and colorful and
you can go ham and smokey it's such a
good palette and it's so affordable I
love it so much another palette that
I've been loving this this is by morphe
it's such a big palette and when I first
got it and I was like this is like the
35 vote but like with a couple of cool
tone colors like I saw this that I was
like that is the 3500 with a red and a
lot of green and blue but I've been
using it a lot they put colors that they
thought people would use a lot of as
bigger pans in the center and then you
know different colors smaller
surrounding it and I think this palette
is so bomb it is strongly pigmented I
love that like I love this because these
shades you actually do use the most of I
love that you can go cool toned green
toned never go in there warm toned less
warm toned neutrals it's such an
all-around beautiful palette and I love
taking this with me because it's a 1
palette and go type of palette like if
you bring this palette with you on
travel or like whatever you're doing
like a night out or you're staying
somewhere and you need a palette to like
bring a look or seven books or ten looks
this palette has got your looks because
there's so much diversity with it I love
all right the first thing I want to talk
about this blush although you haven't
been in my life for a long time I'm
already like hitting it so hard that I
feel like I need a new one because I'm
gonna run out soon this is a Mac fairly
precious extra dimension blush oh my god
oh my god I put my nail in it this blush
right here gives you that natural glow
irradiation trying like I pop this onto
my cheeks and it gives me that little
bit of Sheen it gives me that little bit
of glow and it just makes me look very
healthy and glowy and very radiating
from within
what am i a heater what I just kazoo
that very naturally flushed beautiful
like oh my god you like a pregnancy glow
I love that blush that's my favorite
blush for those of you who thought I was
not gonna do it you're wrong hello my
favorite highlighter of the year when it
comes to like cheek highlighting and
just overall
lighting glazed donut this is my
highlighter I made this highlighter this
is this is my baby I made four
highlighters with Oprah cosmetics glazed
donut then we have a medium shade which
is glow goals and then we have a darker
shade for darker skin tones which is
blind to haters and then if you want all
three colors together it is ever globe
glazed donut is my baby this will make
me look like I am sending signals to
Jupiter's like in my honest opinion and
yes I am very biased because I created
it it is the glow of all glows like you
can put a tiny bit of this on to make it
very soft and dewy but you pack it on to
like basically in the summer when
there's people on the beach and you're
wearing this on your cheeks and you send
in the right angle with the Sun people
will tan faster because of the
reflection it's a really good
highlighter I love it so much and I'm
really really proud that I got to create
my dream highlighters with Oprah in 2017
so um two products for the lips this I
feel so bad talking about this product
sometimes because I'm like it's such a
small step but it's one of my favorite
steps in my makeup routine this is very
wave they came out with lip liners in
2017 and they came out with shimmer Reed
lip liners in 2017 this is jus a long
wear creme lip liner in pink champagne
shimmer I define my Cupid's bow with
this so I put it on like I draw my
Cupid's bow in then I buff it in with my
fingers and it gives me the most
naturally voluptuous effect on earth and
it's such a tiny step in my makeup
routine but it does so much into like to
my face alright there are so many
lipsticks on the market that I will not
go there I cannot pick one as like my
favorite of the year I do have a lip
gloss that has taken my ass and took me
to heaven this right here is my
Maybelline this is the vivid hot lacquer
in the color 60 T's um this has been
with me for so long this is about my
third tube when I'm wearing new glossy
lips this is the gloss I'm wearing if
you see me on snapchat Instagram stories
with Instagram photos and you see me
wearing a
ah see new lip it's this don't ask me
what it is you don't even have to read
the caption if it's glossy and it's nude
it's this one right here probably the
best lip gloss formula out there because
it's packed with pigment they stay on
for so long I mean every lip gloss is
sticky but this one is a non like
irritating stick you like it's a nice
sticky I feel like this has pigment it
stays on it's beautiful it's affordable
they come in a bunch of colors the best
so those are all the products that make
my 2017 even more lit ma 2017 even
better and now my final question is what
