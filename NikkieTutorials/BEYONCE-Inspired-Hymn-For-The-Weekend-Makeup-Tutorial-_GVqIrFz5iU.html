tutorial on this makeup look right here
inspired by Beyonce and it all comes
from her new music video with Cole
playing him for the weekend and just uh
when she graced our lives by coming
through in that music video I did dead
obsessed there were two looks there was
one look with the dark lip look and then
there was that look with the gold lip
and the more smoky eyes so I went for
the first look because dead deceased
done of course I look nothing like
Beyonce so I'm not nearly as flawless I
may not look like her but I had a lot of
fun recreating her makeup look so if you
would like to know I have to give this
Beyonce and spread makeup look thank you
for watching
alright the first thing I'm gonna do is
pry my face and I'm doing this using my
Nivea men aftershave balm insensitive
and I know this has been going
everywhere on the internet lately and
it's so cool to see so many of you try
something out I recommend it so thank
you thank you for the trust
I'm going to follow through using some
tatcha luminous dewy skin mist for
foundation today I'm going to use the
ex1 invisi wear liquid foundation and
did anyone of you see Kylie Jenner on
the cover of Elle UK where she had like
minimum makeup on and she's really
natural beauty if they actually used
this foundation on her for that shoot
and I know that Rita Ora were it on her
season of The X Factor in the UK so it's
a good foundation because it works for
photoshoots it works for TV it will work
for the red carpet it will work for
events is just a really good foundation
in free to aura and kylie jenner can
wear it and so many other celebrities
lined up so I'm going to be applying it
with a damp Beauty Blender to get the
best coverage and let's just transform
this space into something Beyonce would
wear which is smallest has amazing
coverage oh my gosh I love the color I
love the coverage yes yes and yes I know
a lot of youtubers have been using this
foundation as well but I never knew
where to get it and then I finally found
out where
to get it that actually ships to Holland
where I live I personally got it from
look fantastic calm and they do free
worldwide shipping so I was sold I also
had a couple of blushes from them so I'm
going to try those later on in this
video but so far this foundation is
stunning I mean just look at the
coverage today for concealer I'll be
using the tarte maracuja creaseless
concealer in the color fair I'll be
applying this using my fingers and
blending in using my Beauty Blender hmm
so I'm that miss fame weeped right now
don't judge
and I'm going to do a little bit of
baking using the NARS soft velvet loose
powder in snow the first thing I'm going
to do for eyes is of course primum and
I'm using my soccer over Paint Pot by
Mac and applying this using a sigma 3d
HD precision brush the first color I'll
be going in with is by Kat Von D and
it's the shade + light eye palette and
I'm taking this taupey color right here
and with a Mac 224 I'm just going to
define the crease softly
also dosing some on the inner crease
thread here and blend up softly
for the green I'm going to take this
Natasha de Nona eyeshadow palette and
taking this olive pearly green right
here and applying this with a zoeva 234
brush and this is mainly going on the
centre of the lid to really attract
light I'm going to darken the outer
corners using this shape right here and
using a Cosette D 220 brush for this
on the inner third of the lid I'm going
to apply that same calf and a darker
taupe shade color and mixing it with
this color by makeup geek called dirty
martini and this is going on using eight
Cosette es1 eight five brush
and then going back in with that Natasha
to Nona green color to really pop it
like come through green it's time for
some darkness on the waterline and for
this up using the Urban Decay 24/7
glide-on eye pencil in perversion and
now with a Cosette D 230 brush and then
a smoke that aren't using that same dark
taupe color from the calf and a pallet
and now mixing in a little bit of Max
femme noir to add a little hue of green
and now with a teeny tiny zueva 240
brush and a little bit of that dirty
martini color by makeup geek I'm going
to smoke out the inner corners and now
with a more fee for t3 my favorite
tightlining brush and a little bit of
black eyeshadow I'm just going to smoke
out the roots of the lashes and one last
time I'm just going to go back in with
that green and really intensify it I'm
going to finish off with some lashes
these are by morphe and these are the
217 and they're perfect for a lash
drunky like I am because they give you a
little bit more definition but they're
not overpowering so you can still see
what's going on on the eyes for cheeks
the first thing I'm going to do is again
we want to get to that Beyonce level
which is flawless and in order for me to
become a little bit more flawless any
contouring in my life set and I found
out about this new product because of my
friend Curtis miss fame this is the
Kevin of Kwan sculpting powder a medium
and it has taken over my life
I am so obsessed with it it's so good
I'm going to contour with that today and
the brush I'll be contouring with is by
morphe and it's the m5 3-0
then I'm going to warm my complexion up
a little bit more using this ex1 blush
in Jet Set glow and these blushes are
super pigmented so be careful with them
but for a little more pop of cheek I'm
going to go in with this color also by
ex1 and it's the color pretty and peach
and I'm going to apply that using a
Cosette s one two three brush stuff it's
really pigmented be careful but so
gorgeous I love that color so I'm gonna
start highlighting today using so
Hollywood by I'm sassy I'm Beverly and
of course my favorite highlighting brush
my morphe M 310 so this is like an
overall glow and then to really make it
pop in certain areas I'm going in with
Becca moonstone you know what I mean
it's at Cabal highlighter for the entire
weekend who am I kidding here entire
year also going to highlight the tip of
my nose and Cupid's bow with moonstone
our lips of course we're going to go for
the beautiful luscious chocolate mouth
so for this I'm first going in with my
new dose of colors liquid lipstick in
the colour chocolate wasted this might
be my brain playing tricks on me but I
feel like chocolate wasted actually
smells like chocolate and I'm adding
just a tiniest bit of dose of colors a
desert suede
like this and that guy's concludes this
