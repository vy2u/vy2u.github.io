alone on my channel I am joined by
celebrity makeup God
Sir John hi guys he has done Ashley
Graham he has done Joan Smalls he has
done Priyanka yeah and oh my god I'm
gonna be touched by a makeup God today
and Sir John is gonna be doing my makeup
I said you have full control if you
wanna do it you can rub dirt on my face
you can do whatever you want so today is
gonna be all about two artists sharing
the love for makeup and just having fun
we get to know Sir John a little bit
better I got some questions for you
bring it like anything okay cool
anything I think is good we love this
this girl I've known Nikki like five
years already I know we're we're soul
sisters
all right so Nikki what we're gonna do
so we're gonna start off with a bit
moisturizer okay
what do you have already a beautiful
glow your skin looks really luminous but
I think that I was gonna go in I like to
prep cream eyeliner I'm using a
water-based moisturizer because I don't
want to I'm gonna offer you some
hydration mm-hmm without any oil so I
saw you say in an interview once that
you put eye cream all over the face I do
and you can you know what I think that
eye cream is also a really good prep for
your everyone loves like matte liquid
lipsticks you know so matte liquid
lipsticks are great but they do
dehydrate you so after you do I cream on
your lips because your eyes and your
lips are the same kind of scary so
thinnest one was transparent yeah so if
you get into a habit of doing that and
there may be a little chopstick to set
it in it won't change the texture of
your matte lipstick how did you start
because I feel like people don't know
that I went to school for art since I
was like 6 years old you know and then I
am I started I completely went into
makeup on accident it wasn't on purpose
so I worked for Mac when I was 19 and
wells in New York I got fired from Mac
at 24 being late 22 started to do the
windows for Burt Bergdorf Goodman
Barneys
and no big deal and but one accidentally
once again like I just thought people
like doing the windows oh but guys how
do you do this can I gonna work with you
hey
and so the director of visual at
Bendel's said hey listen we spend the
night in the store tonight and help us
with this Christmas display so I did it
got into that and then um I was on my
lunch break and I met a friend who was
well no colleague from Mac he was
actually his name was you Dean
he's a makeup artist and he's like hey
listen you have to meet Pat McGrath
she's super cool she travels alone
mother and you know Pat's gonna be we're
doing the shows at Bryant Park and this
is when the shows were the tents were
still at Bryant Park not a Lincoln
Center yeah I saw I went to the shows
and I sort of basically met her she
asked me was gonna be in Italy in Milan
two weeks later and I was like yeah sure
I'm of course I'm gonna be there yeah
mind you I had no passport no way to get
there no money to get that time but I
made it work I found a way to could make
it work in went to Italy and she took me
to Prada Dolce and all these other shows
and and then I met Charlotte Tilbury
who's still like a fairy godmother she's
been so amazing you know and she
introduced me to Beyonce it 2010 at Tom
Ford's person were so yeah it kind of
happen organically and one thing led to
another and then Here I am you guys what
I'm gonna do right now I'm using a brow
gel but this is a conventional brow gel
so this is a hack I like to call glue so
I like to use lace-front glue and a very
small amount a super small amount the
tiniest you can on the brows and it
keeps me in place all that so doesn't
matter if you swim or if you're doing a
video and the video is 17 hours long it
works so that's how there's so obviously
I mean this video is not gonna be all
about Beyonce but we got a dress the
elbow
what is your favorite like you've ever
done on Beyonce favor look I've ever
done Beyonce what happened to be either
the video ma called mine
yeah or I love I love what she's
pregnant we did the Grammys that was fun
mm-hmm and so I painted her goal
everywhere Beyonce's got hot sauce in
her bathroom what's the weirdest product
in your bag I think the weirdest product
in my bag
using on you at the moment which is half
what happens to be late smart glue to
the club house abroad oh my favorite
thing about your style is that's always
modern it's always new um it's always
fashion but it always makes the client
even more severe thank you very much you
know I think the goal with makeup or
beauty in my opinion is just enhance
it's like to to magnify or choose like
cast a bit of like glowing light on a
person yes I feel like right now we live
in a society like that a microwave
society where everyone starts to look
alike everyone starts to have the same
visual identity and we need to run away
from that you know yeah it's just one
thing so now we're gonna go into ice so
we have a grip brow and I think the
brawl is believable but I want to go
into eyes and make them a bit more
intact so I'm so ready for you to do my
skin oh yeah people my channel know that
mama tutorials loves a bit of coverage
oh yeah no I got you covered
I know that a bit of cake but you know
and I just I can't wait because you're
the way you just get it so believable
whereas I am commercial I can't wait no
no it's gonna be cool and also it is
layering layering is key so I'm gonna
start off possibly something sheer and
then we're gonna build up the coverage
you know yeah so going back into eyes
babe we're gonna do I'm using the
palette whoo that you need so I'm gonna
use up color a warm color to your eyes
and we're gonna dust this all over the
lid and so I'm starting to pet the let
the base of your lash line I'm just
washing the color up I'm gonna stop
somewhere about it first the fact that
you even touching my face right now
dreams come true I just wanted people to
know that you have always been such an
inspiration and I guess that the way you
approach makeup it's so modern
do you prefer doing eyes lips cheeks
skin yeah I'm a huge guy
I think eyes are the windows to the soul
and if you can I mean you know as humans
we have an emotional
when you have a conversation with
someone it starts in the eyes first if
that connection starts in the eyes and
this is just the draped I guess to the
windows of the soul I want to make that
connection lasts a bit longer yeah by
using something that is gonna be you
know visually arresting so a couple
years ago I was we did the Met Ball and
then everyone and this is what we're was
is 2017-2018 that's recent
what she wore the latex with Ricardo his
last year yes oh I know we're at this
going
I'd say everyone started to tea gave me
a graphic picture of a graphic I he's
like hey listen can you do this yeah
sure so whatever but the thing about any
kind of fanbase they want to see their
people in something that they're
comfortable with yeah so a model you can
do any kind of income wins you can do
any kind of lifts sometimes on an
actress as well but when you have a
musician and she has massive fan base
they want that formula that they're used
to seeing yeah to stay around the
Beehive dragged me to hell that day
right so I'm at dinner and I started to
get these started CDs on these
notifications of like where is he mean
to kill him we need to find him
someone said we need to obliterate him
like oh my god guys this is just his eye
shadow come on like seriously this is my
gosh so it was one of those things where
I didn't necessarily look at as a
mistake because at the end of the day my
client was happy I was happy I liked the
look but you know what it taught me
criticism and compliments they come from
the same place so don't allow criticism
or compliments to move the needle
emotionally inside ever so lose some of
your favorite celebrities to work with I
mean I love Priyanka Chopra I think
she's beautiful when she cover mind he
wears makeup so well we're growing
really strong women you know so it's
really cool to watch these women just
completely fill a room or Phyllis face
with their energy with their presence
you know and that you can learn a lot
from that the reason I'm here is because
of the models the reason I'm here is
because of Joan and Naomi and Jordan
done all these girls they were in my
portfolio before Instagram these the
other reason that the
you knew who I was you know I closer
what I'm doing I'm in it this is a cool
tip and this is like this is kind of
editorial in a sense so I'm gonna wet my
brush and then I want to go into the
shadow this is the Bobby Brown shadow
called serpentine you know what it does
it makes it more luminous it makes it
more light reflective and it honestly
last longer throughout your day so how
much time do you usually get when you're
doing that carpet 20 minute no not a
long time I'm always just so abused I
hate to say it but it's one of those
things where they kind of makes it back
to you - how do you do that I'll work
really quick you want to know where I
got my speed mm-hmm I'll tell you where
I got speed bass so I was working you
know doing the editorial circuit and I
was making no money as a editorial
assistant I mean you don't make a lot of
money
so I was I saw a friend of mine she's
like hey Sir John listen we're all some
Omak employees we're gonna go to the
strip club in Queens and start doing
makeup on the girls they're quite I
already love where this is gone and so
I'm like you want me to do what what hat
so basically I went to strip club in
Queens called Rivia straddle - Riviera's
hey girls I started to make up there and
it was one of the best experiences in my
life mistake I didn't make it there for
two years but it allowed me to sort of
chase my dreams and during the daytime
for free so I got really quick when you
have like all these girls got all these
cardi B he's waiting for you basically
you got a power through I love that
you're full of good story but what has
been the most extreme sort of situation
where you had to do makeup in like was
it in a meet house was it in like where
was it I have to and the first was
definitely on my so we were in Vancouver
on a way to do a concert this was during
the Miss Carter show era hey miss hey
miss Carter right and she her flight got
in late and I had I met her at the
airport
and I had to do her makeup in the SUV
and it had to be ready by the time we
got to that Stadium and so basically I'm
leaning over the bat I'm leaning over
the passenger seat because I'm next to
the driver and she's like you know she's
leaning her face is leaning to me I'm
leaning over and we're turning over a
dyke but I gave up roofing wings even
wings and everything in the paparazzi my
wing a wing I
and so that became like literally the
craziest make of I've had to do whatever
in life and then we did it like the
makeup on and the plane on the way up
while it's like you're supposed to be
seated
yeah and I'm like I can do this friend
should I try and I was like okay you
know what I'll try are you all right
honestly nowadays there's nothing I
think anyone can throw at me that like I
got that yeah we can we can we can roll
with the punches if you dip I dip we dip
okay babe so what I'm doing now is I'm
taking a waterproof liner and we're
lining the bottom so I'm giving you like
a smokey eye but I'm never I'm not using
anything with light reflective
underneath so I'm using a map I don't
need to really absorb the light so what
I'm doing that Isaac isn't taking the
liner and it was gonna bring your eyes
out a bit more just dragging them
because I want to make them even more
feline and increase the silhouette even
when it comes to this look is there like
a plan do you come in like oh we can do
this and then we can do that or is it
just I pick up a brush and we'll see
what happens no plan you know what my
plan was I had no I just knew I don't
want to do eyes so I just know sometimes
about the feature and I don't
necessarily know the color or whatever
like when I was working in my makeup bag
just no opening and like organizing
everything you saw these beautiful
silver shadow and as soon as you saw
that I'm like this work up and out when
Nicky first hit me up on Instagram I was
like oh wait are you kidding me when you
responded I was like I was like oh my
god anything big plans for the next
couple of months
I have a lot of things crazy coming
joining me also nourish your um I wants
you but I want you but I have a couple
of things that are happening around so
I'm just trying to make it work because
I want to make it work for her but I
also going to go into partnership with a
South African retailer can't say name so
would you ever want to create your own
products that's happening right now
like literally as we speak um wait does
anyone know no not really oh now we do
so basically building the coverage where
you need it and where you don't I'm not
gonna use much it's almost like a sheer
bail everywhere mm-hmm and then I take a
brush like a 224 from Mac or something
like that and I go in and give a bit
more than certain areas so ladies when
you're holding your brush don't hold
your brush here right so you're gonna
get no snow flexibility get in the habit
of holding it somewhere in this area
where here and so and this is where you
want to pay attention to any skincare
concerns you may have or a birthmark or
you know it's a perfect pregnancy mask
how do you keep her base on when she's
dancing and she's doing all of that you
know it's duality um so I like to use a
cream foundation and a powder foundation
so when you have that sense of duality
or using two it becomes like a Teflon
coated face you know what though I don't
use moisturizer when she's performing
because the more my riser lifts the
foundation if she comes well that's one
thing at home you like you might want to
take in consideration so what is like
the the number one performance
foundation that lasts oh okay I'm gonna
show you right now this old-school RC RC
amazing it's like it's the only thing
that's the only thing that will last on
stage I'm Chuck so this is my favorite
thing to do is concealer application so
I take a big Brush and eyeshadow brush
and turn this way and we're gonna go
directly underneath the eyes
and if you notice I'm gonna take so
basically underneath the eyes we're
gonna do before I put powder there to
set I'm going to show you a little trick
that's hope so this is one of my
favorite colors to use ever so I'm gonna
use that to blend the eyes so that's
gonna be like my magic blender I'm gonna
take that we're gonna blend the eye and
so the concealer and then nobody knows
they're looking at you don't see this
really but if photographs you get the
most beautiful blown up blend ever and
then do the same thing in the top a lot
of celebrities are on their phone a lot
hmm how do you deal with that are you
like hey listen up Oh either okay that's
a good question fair question alright so
there's a couple things that can happen
a I'll ask hey do you have a headset or
headphone you know like because we're in
the air we're in the years of technology
where there's wireless everything then
I'll jump sighs I'll jump to the other
here I'll do the other ear I mean the
other side you know but there also comes
a time when you know your client or my
clients I have a few in mind well they
want to talk to the policies they want
to talk to this person you want to look
at this person and yeah and and then
also people are come in the room I'm
like guys you see what's happening here
and you see that she's trying to turn
every time you talk so stand right here
so I'll direct where she needs to look
or where they need to stand yeah and if
that doesn't happen if I have no control
I'll put my brushes down and I'll step
back so I'm good no job starts on the
sockets of the eyes I'm just fixing the
smoke at the bottom
you know you remind me of your gonna
remind me of Chloe Chloe - yeah and get
that's so much do ya okay I'm like a lot
she's but she's so fucking cool like
she's really a cool girl the other hotel
that day do you like to vote on this
tonight all right all right cool so now
we're gonna find the perfect lip I'm
using my fingers only because it's
easier for me and sometimes a brush
application this takes too long
so that's it guys that that is Sir John
