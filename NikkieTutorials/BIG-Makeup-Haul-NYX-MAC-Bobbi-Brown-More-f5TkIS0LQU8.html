because my boyfriend was leaving for a
holiday and I knew I was going to be
alone for an entire week so I was in
need of some serious retail therapy
anyways I went makeup shopping online
and in real life and today I decided to
share it with you because I told you
guys on Twitter and everyone on Twitter
was like do a haul because you haven't
done a Hollie like forever and I was
like I know girl so without any further
ado let's go on to the hall oh okay so
the most exciting things I want to talk
about are the sauce box palettes I have
heard so many amazing things on these
that I couldn't wait to get some so I
ordered three and I'm going to show you
all of them the first palette is the
temptation palette and I love the
packaging it comes in a very fun box
with this blonde scary chick with hair
covering her eyes The Grudge gone blonde
the temptation get out the temptation to
get out are you ready
boom bitch boom let me go through the
colors this is how does this work I
don't know I don't know this is orange
Sun aqua Ramah mermaid and yellow ho
yell Oh yellow I mean come on
just just look at it it's it's
fan-freaking-tastic amazing I love this
can't wait to play with this can wait
the smear this all over my face I'm
another self box palette I got is creme
de la creme ben de la creme
Oh talk to us ho I mean again come on
this is insane this palette is more of
the shimmery shades but it does have a
matte black and it just has really nice
highlighting colors really nice sort of
grungy grayish colors and then a true
silver and oh my god I am I want to play
with these so bad and then the last
Saucebox palette I want to talk about
and this is the one I am most excited
about this is a tude and this is the a
tooth pellet and oh oh my gosh I have a
hunch I have a feeling that this baby
right here is going to be my everyday
neutrals holy gray
well for this year because look at the
magic that is inside we got the
highlighting colors we've got the crease
color we got a matte black we got a gray
and warm tone color
we got a blending color we've got a
grayish greenish color this palette is
out of this world amazing I cannot wait
to dig into these I also got the bubbly
brown skin foundation stick in number
zero porcelain and I've heard greats of
things about these as well I especially
got it because Lisa Eldridge used it in
one of her recent videos and you know
that one sleeves I use is something
tough to have it apparently it gives you
full coverage it gives you an amazing
dewy finish and her grades of things
about these so I can't wait to dig into
that either either is it either or
either I never understood fro Mecca got
the Select cover-up concealer in nw15
and why I got this is because I read an
article on Maleficent's Angelina Jolie
Maleficent makeup artists and in the
article they told us which foundation
they use on Angelina and why they used
these select cover-up is because it
didn't mess with the prosthetics like
the pointy cheeks Angelina did not break
out from this and plus it looked
absolutely amazing on camera so after I
read that I was like okay I'm out I'm
gonna get select cover-up and I'm
actually wearing it today mixed with my
L'Oreal True Match in and one and you
can actually see me apply it in my Elle
Fanning Maleficent red carpet look so
click here or in the link down below to
see how it applies but so far I am
loving this I got the Shiseido
shimmering cream eye color it's a cream
eye shadow in our three thirteen I got
this because I saw a makeup artist on
YouTube use this and she says she loved
us for on the red carpet so I was like
okay I'm going out it's a really nice
bronzy warm brownish color and it has a
lovely Sheen and shine to it and I can't
wait to actually try this out on my
clients in all my models for like red
carpet seasons or like a photo shoot or
whatever around myself I mean
come on the treat ourselves like start
NYX recently came out with their macaron
lipsticks and I of course needed a
couple because when a brand comes out
with crazy colors it screams money so I
got three of the macaron lipsticks this
right here is violet this is pistachio
and this is rose and I am loving Rose at
the moment because it's just the perfect
sort of candy cotton pink color violet
is going to be amazing for all your
purple lovers out there and pistachio I
mean um you gotta be a daredevil for
this one but I can think of so many
great parties and events to wear this to
it's not the most flattering one you
won't look really pretty with it but
it's fun to play with colors like these
so um I got those going back to Mac
apparently I also got two new pressed
pigment because pressed pigments are one
of my all-time favorite eyeshadows in
the Mac range because I love to shine
the shimmer of the glitter the sparkle
enos I absolutely love those I got jet
Couture which is a really nice black
gray with green and gold and silver
sparkles in it it's absolutely gorgeous
and then I also got sweet acting which
is a really cool tone to baby light pink
and this has silver and magenta sparkles
in it and it's just these two are so
gorgeous I love the past pigments
because they have that beautiful sparkle
and they're great for a party look I got
four new makeup geek pigments because I
am loving utopia and afterglow and a
couple of more and I just I felt like I
needed more in my collection so the ones
I got are insomnia and this is a great
deal for Mac's blue brown pigment and
then I also got New Year's Eve and this
reminds me of a loose form of the
illusion domville by Chanel in the gold
shimmering color this is like a pigment
form of it I also got liquid gold
because holy that is amazingly
gorgeous it's a yellow toned metal gold
and I cannot wait I cannot wait and then
less than at least I got sweet dreams um
and this is a really perfect you for max
and
naked pigment but it's a little bit more
shiny and a little bit more Juche to it
I got a long come on bruh Hypno's
eyeshadow in I 102 Papeete deuce and I'm
actually wearing this on my inner
corners today and it looks like this
this is so pretty it's like the most
stunning inner corner highlighter shade
ever it's so glowy and sparkly and just
gorgeous
I mean I've never experienced an
eyeshadow that glowed so much because
it's not necessarily a shiny or sparkly
or glittery shadow it's just it glows
and if you want to go for that really
extreme highlight on your cheekbones
this will do the job
oh and also got another NYX butter gloss
and this is maple blondie
I ordered about twelve last time and I
needed this one as well because I saw so
many great things on Instagram and on
websites and our reviews so I'm glad
that maple blondie is the thirteenth in
my NYX butter gloss collection so that
