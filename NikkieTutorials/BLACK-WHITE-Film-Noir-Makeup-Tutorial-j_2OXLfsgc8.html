inspired by this week's challenge on
RuPaul's Drag Race the black and white
realness so basically this was inspired
by detoxes look at the season five
reunion where she came out in black and
white makeup and she looked like an old
screen movie star and when I saw that
they made it a runway challenge this
week I was so excited and I couldn't
wait to film a tutorial for you this
week yeah without any further ado if you
would like to know how to get this black
and white grey realness makeup look then
keep on watching okay let's get started
the first thing you want to do normally
is moisturize on prime but because we're
going to work with a white base you want
this to be as opaque as possible so I'm
actually gonna leave my skin as it is I
still have a little bit of moisture from
last night when I apply to my
moisturizers but other than that I'm not
going to apply anything else and just go
straight in with the product so I'm just
going to go in straight with my white
Kryolan tv pin stick and just all over
and then buff it in with a Beauty
Blender
you know nice and natural go grocery
shopping and especially with this you
want to keep the most coverage out of
your product is you do not want any skin
color coming through come through skin
color
so with this especially you want to tap
that skin up and down tap that skin
don't drag the color around just tap it
in here we're going to double it up
underneath the eyes to get rid of any
dark circles even though we're great
and I tend to bake a set that I'll with
powder and I'm going to use my ven nice
super white and I'm just going to set my
entire face using that same powder you
want to set especially because once
we're going to contour and bring in
depth with powders you want the base
underneath to be super powdered so it
blends easier alright I'm quickly going
to fill in my brows in a of coarse gray
dark color all right brows done time to
work on the eyes I'm going to go in as a
base with the Tarte claypot Amazonian
clay waterproof liner in white and this
stuff is amazing and it will truly hold
up to anything I'm just going to wear
this on as my base today
that was my beauty blender I like to
smooth it out a little by little I mean
a lot and with my Sephora
eyeshadow the white Sephora I shadow in
letted snow I'm just going to set
everything from crease to brow bone area
to help blending later on and trust me
we need this stuff I'm going to go in
with the morphe 12z palette I'm going to
go in with this dark gray color right
here and what this we're going to cut
the crease same palette this a lighter
gray color right here to buff it out
same color a little bit more of a
diffused brush keep on blending now with
the black we're really going to go in
and define
okay that's high for the lid color I'm
going to take this donessa Marek's of
metals pigment in supreme gift Oh silver
odd and as the base I'm first going to
lay down the Urban Decay bondage
weightless makeup adhesive okay can we
just talk about this pigment for a hot
minute oh my goodness it looks like
liquid silver on my lids alright time
for some thick-ass liner right away
right now I'm using the black liquid
liner by Inglot which I'm really liking
so far okay
lower lash line I'm not gonna go in with
the carroty eyeshadow in raft I'm really
focusing on the outer corner for now and
then we're going to pull a miss fame and
create a new inner corner and with the
black smudging it out
all right all I'm going to do not too
quickly Canisius I look off is apply
some mascara and false lashes and don't
hold back on the drama so my first
prayer is going to be the El Cajon
lashes and number 300 and I have them
here already and just top them all I am
and like I said do not hold back on the
drama so I have a pair of three ones
here and I'm going to cut them in half
and place one half on the outer half of
my eye okay so I think the inner half of
the 3:01 looks better with this look and
I cut about six lash strokes in alright
let's place it on the really elevated
really place it on top of that eyeliner
not as much follow your natural lashes
just pop it on that liner and kind of
tilted into the direction of that liner
to get a nice elongated eye hello mister
on the bottom both eyes done now it's
time for the fun part the contouring and
highlighting also all in great so I'm
going to contour using this color from
the same morphe palette and remember to
go very very softly with this one if you
use a little bit too much with the
powder it quickly becomes patchy and
ugly so go soft gentle and take your
time
this is where all the lights comes back
into that face and where we get to have
fun by bringing back all that structure
and the brush I'm using is by Cosette
this is the s130 brush and if you're not
happy with the blending take your brush
that you used to set your foundation
with with the super white powder and
with the kind of tap at the edges and
blend everything nice and smooth and
you're good to go a little bit around
the hairline just bring in back there
going you can always go back in with a
brush that still has some super ripe
powder in it and make it smooth and also
super super lightly going to do my nose
and now we may be black-and-white but we
still want to glow as if we were a color
TV does anyone know what I mean I just
want to glow and I want everyone to see
it so I'm gonna go in with curl by Becca
because this is white just go crazy
oh hello Oh mother we have arrived this
glow right here tells other gray bitches
out there don't mess with me my glow is
stronger than yours okay that's it for
the lips and I'm gonna go in with a
matte black lip paint just to give it
such a nice statement and to make a dark
so I'm gonna go in with the coloured
raine matte lip paint into am how crazy
does this look and going over top with
Geoffrey starts a weirdo because this is
probably the blackest liquid lipstick
