showing you how to rock blue lipstick
and I know it can be super super
intimidating and the reason why I came
up with this video is because it's this
week's RuPaul's Drag face installment
and my winner this week was Laila
McQueen
I love Laila she's so gorgeous so funny
so sarcastic and I love her paint her
makeup is so so good so it hurts me to
see her go but I know she'll go far and
hopefully she likes this video so into
this video I'm gonna show you how to
recreate a Leila's look in a little bit
more of a soft this is by no means soft
but saw a tiny bit softer than Laila and
then I'm also going to show you with
that how to rock blue lipstick because
blue lipstick is awesome there without
any further ado if you would like to
know I have to get this look right here
and then keep on watching okay so I have
a little story to tell you and this is
also the reason why on Wednesday I
didn't have video going up on Monday I
got a facial peel and it was with all
natural fruit acids and the girl who did
it on me told me you know what you'll be
fine your skin will be renewed and were
born for tonight's video that you're
gonna film tonight basically my skin got
all red and then after that it started
to peel and get really dry and patchy so
I tried to record this video yesterday
and I filmed up to two times and it
looked like crap because my under-eye
area was so dry and it just looked so
wrong but after a day full of masks and
moisturizers I'm back and ready to film
this one so I went in with the hola BOE
super foodies calm cleansing face oil
and this is a great product because one
it's a cleanser it's a cleansing oil to
get your makeup off with but two if you
use a tiny teeny bit it's great as a
serum so degree find that you have two
purposes for one product and then after
I went in with the only moisturizer I
know that is like hardcore and will
moisturize a desert and that is the
olavo beauty sleep cream and this is the
most hardcore moisturizer I know of so I
packed those two on this morning and I'm
all moisturized and ready to go today
want to do some color correction so I'm
going to go in with the new Becca
backlight
targeted color correctors and I'm going
to use the color green for my redness
peach for any shadows and I'm going to
use the color violet to perk up my skin
so just with a flat foundation brush I
pick some of the product up and just
paint it on my face
can you see how much had already reduced
any redness on my face so much more
peaceful as you can see the more I apply
the violet sort of as a flower from
within the more healthy and just radiant
assert that look and last but not least
a little bit of the peach on my chin
area
now with the slightest like the
slightest bit of powder you gently want
to press this all over the face to set
the color correction and go over top
with the foundation if you do not do
this basically what you're doing is all
this color correction work once you go
over with your foundation it will just
start dragging the color correction and
you've done everything for nothing so
you kind of want to sit and lock all
this correction with the tiniest bit of
powder for foundation today I'm going to
go in with my favorite my Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD foundation Stix I'm going
to go in with 117 on the inner perimeter
of my face and 120 on the outer that's
it you're done I hope you enjoy those
Laila McQueen look
for concealer I'm going to go in with it
cosmetics bye bye under-eye and a tiny
bit of Kyle and TV paint stick and
double zero to lighten it and again you
know the drill and I'm gonna bake using
my NARS soft velvet loose powder in snow
the first thing I'm going to do to make
this look lasts all day long is prime
using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and
I'm using a sigma 3d HD precision brush
for this now with my Kiko number one
high pigment eyeshadow i'm going to set
my crease to brow bone area to help
blending later on now I'm going to go in
with the morphe 35 K palette and taking
this color right here to cut my crease
and the brush I'll be using for this is
my Cosette s one-eight-five and instead
of really precisely applying it right
now I'm just going to sloppily blending
it in there and then with the lid color
we can really clean it up and cut it now
with the Cosette D 220 and a somewhat
lighter color from that same palette I'm
going to buff it out
and now with this color right here I'm
really going to intensify the base of
that cut crease and doing so with my
Cosette p36 five brush
and then with that same Kiko color you
can really use it as an eraser and
softly blend all the edges and give him
a nice fade and kind of corrected with
all of this for my lids I'll be going in
with this dose of colors ideal duo in
frozen and the top comes with a creamy
product so I'll be find that as a base
and on the bottom it comes with a
beautiful pigment and I'll be applying
that over top and for this I'm using my
Mac 242 and like I said with this you
can really clean up the cut crease and
cut it
and now going back in with those darker
brown colors and you can really really
define it and give it more depth now I'm
highlighting my inner corners using that
same Kiko shadow again and also dragging
it all along my lower lash line with my
cavity tattoo liner in trooper I'm going
to outline my wing
and now with tarts so fine micro liner
I'm going to extend my inner corners and
now with my Sigma line a stand legend
I'm going to fill everything in
now I'm going to apply the new makeup
geek full spectrum I pencil in nude to
my waterline to open up four lashes
today I'll be using these by Hooda
Beauty called Audrey and I'm going to
try the crispy method of applying lashes
by just looking straight forward and
then come in with the lash from above
and just dropping it on there from the
top then dropping the corners off to
their destination
give them one less push and they're on
all right cheekbones let's cut these
cheeks making super fares to show these
bitches to not mess with me because of
my cheeks
honey as my Kevin a Kwan medium
sculpting powder and my favorite
contouring brush by morphe this is the
morphe m5 30
you
and to clean the lines up in between
here I'm going to take my face powder
which is my Mac Studio Fix in nw15 and
this new morphe brush which is already
one of my all-time favorites this is the
m4 for 4 and this will pack powder or
concealer or foundation on like boughs
and with this I like to go in with my
powder and clean up underneath to cut it
to show these bitches not to mess with
me for blush I'm going to use a color
from the new oh for a blush palette and
I'm going to go in with this color right
here and a tiny tiny bit of the color
right next to it and I'll be applying
that using my Cosette number 2 brush and
again if you want to tone that down a
little you can go back in with that m4
for 4 by morphe it still has the powder
in it and you can blend it out and make
it look softer for a highlighter of
course my favorite one by Becca
moonstone and my favorite highlighting
brush by morphe my M 310 also gonna do
some above my brow I want to look glowy
for this tip of my nose of course
and my cupids bow her lips were gonna go
for those iconic blue lips I was so
excited to see Laila rock those blue
lips because I've been wanting to do
blue lips forever now so this was the
perfect perfect opportunity
so the first color I'm going to go in
with is pink liquid lipstick by
Anastasia Beverly Hills and we're just
going to see how that turns out and then
maybe maybe we can go in with blue
velvet by Geoffrey start but let's just
see how this does on its own
and indeed I'm going to go over top with
blue velvet by Jeffrey star okay that
just took it to the next level blue
velvet Jeffrey star is life and that
guy's concludes this how to rock blue
