little bit of searching online and on
snapchat and on Instagram and I check
out one of these stories on snapchat and
I bump into this your bra insert is the
only makeup sponge you ever needed what
why yeah your bra insert is the only
makeup sponge you ever need it so right
after I read that I was like what is
happening to this world so I did a
little research and I found out that a
couple girls had tried it on Instagram I
saw a couple girls do it here on YouTube
and I quickly found out that Molly
cosmetics recently came out with the
scylla sponge the Stila sponge is a
sponge made out of silicone and what
it's praised for is that it doesn't soak
up your product like beauty blenders or
brushes will it's silicone so it can't
absorb your Seth so in the end you end
up saving money because it doesn't soak
up all the products making you use less
product and I think because people are
kind of weirded out and they really want
to try it but the scylla sponge is
always sold out like they have pre-sales
and it's still always sold out so I
think people started looking for the
next best thing and somehow they thought
of using silicone bra inserts chicken
cutlets I am here today to try it out
for myself does it really do what it's
supposed to do or it all lies shall we
stick to the Beauty Blender shall we
just stick to normal ordinary products
and step away from the bra insert it's
something I'm intrigued by and I want to
try it so I went ahead and bought the
lift it's magic body fashioned silicone
breast lifting cups and I have a large
face so I went for size Dee's now not
only do we have to be insecure about our
breast sizes we also have to be insecure
about our face sizes which is great
thank you 2016 I'm going to whip one out
they come they come just down in this so
they come like this mom if you're
watching this I hope this is one of your
proudest moments of create
mean your womb oh my god oh the boots
are place all right I can't see et phone
home girl it's really chilly outside
make sure you bring your ear warmers I
don't like bacteria so this will save me
all right so I think the first thing we
have to do is cut this to a comfortable
size
I brought the scissors out okay so um do
I what do I do
I don't know what I'm doing I'm gonna
create a beauty blender sighs I guess we
could go this a boobie blender
okay we're cutting into the boob the
wheels of the boob go round and round
come to a little tip just like the
Beauty Blender like that so I have my
boobie blender ready I'm gonna grab some
foundation and let's try this out all
right so the first thing I'll be doing
is priming such moisturizing my face
with a nice glowy primer this is by Mac
it's called strobe cream and it's in the
color silver light this will really
reflect the light which honestly at this
point is my foundation feels at least
I'll look like a glowing goddess you
know what I like to say when all else
fails just glow their eyes out all right
now gonna go into my favorite foundation
at the moment The Oprah absolute cover
and I guess I just dip this into my
foundation and try it out oh it sounds
really wrong moment of truth what
what the hell um what what is going on
maybe I should start tapping it like a
Beautyblender what is that sound oh my
god it looks so streaky I can't tap it
in like a Beautyblender tap it in
tapping it in okay and all honesty when
you tap it it kind of looks good first
you distribute it onto your face by
swiping it on and then I guess you throw
it in looks atrocious when you first
apply it okay tapping it in try to God
if this works I'm gonna slap someone
with this thing I can't with the sound
if you're doing this with your friends
over they're gonna think you're doing
something way different kind of like me
I'm snapchat people always think you're
watching porn you guys it kind of looks
really good on the stage I'm telling you
when you first apply it you feel like
you're cementing a house
yeah don't swirl the swirling looks
atrocious once you actually start
tapping it in it kind of slaps the
foundation so roughly but nicely into
the skin where it looks really natural
and soft also if you have fake nails and
they're stiletto they're kind of
pinching into the silicone and it leaves
you with sticky tips also I find it to
be really tough to reach all the little
corners all the little nooks and
crannies of my face but I'm telling you
once it's blended into the face it
almost looks like an untraceable
flawless finish I'm like what is even
happening here the nose it's kind of
really hard to do here okay so this is
what one layer of foundation looks like
using the boobie blender first thoughts
here are it takes extremely long to
actually do your foundation with this I
could have done my face with a regular
beauty blender three times in the amount
of time I spend doing this it is hard to
reach all the little crevices and little
corners of the face I will say the once
it's all buffed in and
and it looks like an untraceable
beautiful finish well like in all
honesty you look like an absolute idiot
doing this now the real question here is
does it make your face look more
flawless as opposed to a brush or a
regular Beauty Blender absolutely not
I think that with the Beauty Blender you
have way more control and the finish is
just a little bit more flawless and even
but anyways I'm just going to apply a
little bit more where I feel that I need
it
freaking steely today I'm going into the
Kat Von D cream whatever tattoos
something can I roll Oh
kami can we do like an actual Blender
like that okay that makes it way easier
to get right up underneath that eye I'll
allow out
okay so this is where we're at right now
I wonder if you can bake using this
thing okay no okay no oh my god no no oh
my god what have I done that is the note
that isn't absolute no do not bake with
this thing oh my god but I have to do
what I do this tie to match oh it just
grabs on to one portion and then it
doesn't go away oh my god oh my god oh
yeah another this thing go away
alright so I'm gonna do the rest of my
makeup now and finish off this face and
then we'll see what my final thoughts
are on the booby Blender I love my smoky
as a newt let's get over it alright guys
so I finished doing my makeup and the
overall look once powder is set over top
of it once you apply blush contour
highlight the whole shebang lang lang I
don't mind the finish like it doesn't
look bad I mean my face looks even it
doesn't look patchy it looks well
blended and applied but it took me
forever to do it and I looked like an
idiot doing it so if you ask me the
final verdict on using bra inserts or
chicken cutlets to do your makeup with
it works
you look like an absolute idiot doing it
and I don't recommend doing it around
anyone like anyone like maybe it will
come in handy when you are traveling and
somehow your beauty blender or
foundation brush got lost so you brought
your chicken cutlets and you can cut
some out of it and use that to apply
your foundation and concealer with maybe
somehow in some type of world situation
so final verdict does it work yes do you
want it to work probably do you want to
use this technique in a daily basis
abso-fucking-lutely not like honestly
what are we doing here please for the
love of humanity stop this please get a
grip pull yourself together No so that's
it guys that is my first
questions on the boobie blender if you
