to winter wonder weekdays five this week
is flying by just before we do the
singing it's fine bye it's the most
wonderful time so welcome everybody to
day five of winter wonder week we are
nearing the end so today I thought it
was fun to show up in my most casual
outfit ever today I thought it was
fitting to just come up in my most
casual makeup look to date today I
wanted to grace this channel with this
very casual hair accessory no guys today
is all about skincare so this video has
been so so so requested from me skin is
such a personal thing like I feel like
nobody skin is the exact same I feel
like every person's skin out there is
like their DNA so nobody's skin is the
same everybody has their own needs their
own wishes and their own demands and
therefore I think doing skincare videos
are tricky because we're all so
different but you know we can help each
other out here a little bit so today I'm
gonna get unready on a camera and that's
why I did the most so we went from
bougie and babuji to natural and hey
what's up it's just all about skincare
today so if you were ready to pump that
makeup on that's still fine then watch
yesterday's video because we pound it on
the glam but if you're just sitting down
on this lovely Thursday sit down relax
and let's do our skincare together
all right so this video is gonna be a
little bit of a challenge for me because
the sink is in the room next to me so
I'm gonna do a lot of running back and
forth so um hello before we do anything
I do want to let you know that skincare
is very near and dear and precious to me
my mom actually has her own beauty salon
and so she always has new products for
me to try out whenever I have like a
little issue I go mom
help and then she goes well use this or
try this and then she lets me try it out
so I have tried so many skincare
products throughout my life and that
also kind of made me realized what I
like for my skin would it don't like for
my skin a little methods and products
that do and don't work for me so when it
comes to skincare I it's my religion
listen rule number one if you're
watching this video don't ever sleep
don't ever sleep with your makeup on I
don't care how many Tito's you've had I
don't care how many times he hit the
blood no no no makeup goes off before
you sleep it's my rule it's just I live
religiously by it if I sleep in my
makeup I feel like I have sinned so hard
so that is my biggest rule number one if
you want good skin don't sleep in makeup
okay second thing before we start taking
it off and you get I'm ready with me
water I know every video says it I drink
so much water on a day-to-day basis it's
I feel like sometimes it's not even
healthy because I drink so much water
but it always clears up my skin it's
it's a miracle for the skin so drink
water after that comes products and
actually removing everything and making
your skin look good so people always ask
me Nicki how come you don't have any
pores or how come you look so smooth and
flawless
well I cake it on for starters there's
so much powder on my face there is so
much foundation on my face if it doesn't
look flawless after all that product I'm
doing something wrong I definitely help
myself by setting a matte powder with a
damp sponge that really hides all pores
and any any and like any flaws out there
so that's all in applique
but skincare it does like 50% of the
work for you I just did my makeup for
this video alone yep
this extra look was just for you guys
today so the first thing I always start
with is jewelry
I'm always stacked in jewelry and it
needs to go before we get dirty remove
all the jewelry let's get rid of it okay
move it along
goodbye hair necklace is to remove them
honey then take that off and this is
where it gets a little less attractive I
brush all my hair back and tie it all
right that what did you is remove my
lashes and I always grabbed the little
holder of my lashes and place them back
securely I know a lot of people don't
live their life like this I didn't used
to live my life like that I kept on
losing my favourite lashes and I didn't
know what my lashes were anymore so I
changed my life for the good I do wear
contact so let me actually remove those
and now I'm blind and I can't see if I'm
in focus alright so now it's time to get
I'm sorry so now it's time to actually
remove all the makeup so what I usually
do is get three cotton thingies the the
little cotton Browns and the eye makeup
remover that has my back all the time is
this one by Lancome it is the B Fasil
non oily instant cleanser so this I love
this it gets everything off case so I
soak the cotton rounds with the Lancome
and then I just put them on my eyes and
let them sit there for a couple of
seconds to break down the product and it
might feel like it isn't doing anything
but it is breaking down all that
concealer all that eyeshadow base if
you're wearing glitter liner mascara it
is breaking apart the product this also
feels very weird to do then I take the
cotton rounds like this and I start
doing soft circles on the eyes you
definitely don't want to put any crazy
pressure on them because that will give
you wrinkles
let me have a look-see that's doing
really well so basically all that
eyeshadow is gone now all you have to do
is focus on the mascara and the liner so
I go and focus on the mascara we're just
doing the soft circular motions on the
lash line ooh we're getting there and
then I usually also remove the lipstick
with this as a face makeup remover I am
addicted to this tatcha one-step
camellia cleansing oil
I love oils to take away my face makeup
because it breaks apart everything and
really gets it off I have dry
combination skin I have dry skin and my
t-zone gets really oily this also gives
me all that nourishment from cleansing
at the same time so it feeds the skin
but it also takes away all the makeup so
pump it into your hand and start
massaging your face and you do have to
wet this and clean it off with a towel
you cannot just leave it like that let's
just massage this in to break apart all
that product okay so now I'm gonna run
to the sink wash this off with water and
dry with a towel one thing I
that's so weird above my eyes is my eyes
tend to water a lot it's because of all
that makeup that is pounded on it it has
been like that for years but this right
here these eye drops right here have
really helped I don't know if they're
sold in America but these are by valeted
app and in Dutch it is called Oh hon -
oh Sh I always put these in right after
taking my makeup off - you give them a
little bit of a rest while that is doing
that it's time to tone my face my
favourite toner is by Sicily this is
called the floral toning lotion which is
alcohol-free and for dry sensitive skin
which is me this is about my third
bottle and I'm almost done and it's my
favorite toner out there and with this I
just kind of go over my face to kind of
conclude the cleansing portion of my
skincare routine it was kind of resets
my skin
brings it back to okay so you just
applied all that makeup and you had an
amazing day but now we're bringing it
back to zero so now my face is
completely bared this is how it came out
of the womb and now it's time to really
hydrate that skin and bring back life
into it so Patrick Starr recently
introduced me to this batata it is
called the essence and the essence says
that it is a concentration of pure
micronutrients that softens and plumps
the skin with deep hydration while
maximizing the performance of the touch
a skincare ritual so simply this is
called a plumping skin softener and I
always go in with this after toning and
basically I feel like when I apply this
it's very liquidy and I feel like what I
apply this moisturizer and AMA skincare
kind of just penetrates the skin a
little bit more and actually does more
to it after that I go in with this sends
this stuff is so bomb I rub some on my
fingers and then I sort of start
massaging it in in circular motions this
moisturizer it's felt to the floor this
moisturizer is very moisturizing but
it's not as thick and I love picnics
risers but this one although it's thin
it gives my skin so much okay it is time
for a pot twist I saved my dry skin by
applying a daily mask so the moisturizer
I just used is amazing at all but it
doesn't do enough for my dry skin if I
leave it at this my skin will be dry in
about an hour so every night when I take
my makeup off and I do my skincare I
apply a mask this is also by Senza this
is called the intense mask delight touch
this is my favorite moisturizing mask on
the planet this will restore dry skin in
a couple of hours I just massage it in
like I do with all my products but this
feels so rich so creamy and so
moisturizing I cannot live without this
it's technically called a mask I just
think it's a very luxe sort of rich
moisturizer cuz it doesn't feel like a
mask and it doesn't apply it like a man
it has changed my skin then it's time
for some eye cream this is awesome
Essenza
I really believe in like keeping close
to one line of product so I usually
stick to Tata and sends up and this is
the age repair 7 to fix eye cream also
24 hour and I take the tiniest dilip of
it and if you've been a longtime
follower you know that I used to have
such dry under eyes like it was no joke
I have two dries under eyes of life and
this completely took care of that I used
to go in with coconut oil I used to go
in with all these oils and nothing well
it worked temporarily so for like two
weeks it would be a miracle and then I
would get dry again this however has
taken care of my under eyes and never
made them dry or cakey again and then
now the most life-changing trick that
I've learned this year in 2017 what I
used to do before was take my makeup off
do toning and then I would go in with an
oil and then slap moisturizers overtop
the biggest no-no in skincare is
applying moisturizers overtop of oil I
only learnt this this year so my life
has been changed in 2017 oils go last I
didn't know it either
if anything that I'm super grateful for
in 2017 it is that I've learned that
oils go last
this oil right here is you need it in
your life this is by bahi cosmetics it's
called the sunflower sweets oil and this
is a dry skin miracle I believe Jackie
had a very bad experience with a product
and it made her skin super super dry and
so she snapped about this bahi sunflower
sweets oil saying that it saved her skin
I ordered it so fast with next-day
shipping and I have been using it ever
since I've had this for a couple of
months now and look how tiny of it I
used and I literally grab a little bit
and I really really recommend that oil
too because that oil has made a vast
change in my skin as well alright so
that is what I do to take off my makeup
and it leaves me with a very nourished
very moisturize face and then I go to
bed and sleep and I wake up with baby
butt soft skin this is my ritual that
works for me
I will say that this ritual has been in
my life for a couple of months now and
it is amazing I've seen a vast change in
my skin because I am less dry I fixed my
dry skin with this so I do want to do a
couple of honorable mentions as we are
closing off this video people always ask
me how do you get your lips so soft and
plump Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream is a
miracle worker I can wear the most
drying liquid lipsticks out there I can
wear glitter lips for hours as long as I
take that off and apply a nice layer of
eight hour cream skin protectant and I'm
good
I basically always do this when I go to
bed and it's 5:00 in the afternoon now
and I'm like I'm ready for bed now
another honorable mention for the tatcha
luminous dewy skin mist I do not use
this with my makeup any more because I
found that this is a serum this is also
a dry skin saver apply this before you
do your makeup as a primer as like a
moisturizing primer love it but I no
longer set my face with this because I
feel like it's too oily for that when
I'm not in the mood to go through all of
what just happened I sometimes just
spray a little bit of this on and with a
little bit I mean a lot I sprayed this
on and it gives me almost the same
feeling because it gives me that very
nourished moisturize feel and it's a
little bit sticky like it is now because
of the oil the last honorable mention is
for the Ofra peptide brightening mask it
used to be called the Ofra peptide
whitening mask but it freaked people out
because people thought it was bleached
this mask if you follow me on snapchat
you know that I love this before a long
flight ooh it gives you moisture if you
have some spots or like little marks
this just takes care of it this is my
favourite mask because it doesn't dry me
out but at the same time it cleanses but
it also you know removes any spots or
darkness and it just kind of uplifts the
skin and gets it to another level like I
don't know if American people say this
to you but we Dutch you say I would
stick my hand in the fire for this that
is how I could unready that is my
skincare routine and basically what I
know about skin as of lately
so that concludes all of that and that
