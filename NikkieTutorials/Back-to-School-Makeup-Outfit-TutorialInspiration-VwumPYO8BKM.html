big video I'm going to do a
back-to-school inspirational video I'm
going to show you my sort of everyday
look with a little bit of glamour mixed
into there because I love me some bla
bla I'm also going to show you two
little outfits that I put together to
maybe give you some inspiration or what
you can wear on your first day at school
or like your first week or whatever or
your school photo I don't know I know
that a lot of bullying is going around
at schools nowadays um even in my time
I'm 18 years old and I got bullied like
crap I got bullied for everything and
still I managed to get friends and enjoy
school I loved school like I loved um
being with friends and joking around
with teachers I hated the homework
I hated it what I basically want to say
is that if people are giving you a hard
time just basically don't give for crap
they're not worth it
remember that when you're having a hard
time it's all about yourself and staying
strong and ignoring the people and
you're better than that
you're better than those people and look
at us now I mean I got bullied look what
I'm doing now I'm talking to almost two
hundred thousand subscribers now so
that bullies back on track to the makeup
stuff I'm going to show you this natural
look if people from my school are going
to see this video they're going to laugh
because basically the timer started
doing videos um I was in school still so
I bought smoky eyes bright eyes eyeliner
I were everything to school so I
basically was like a a freak show every
day but I loved it anyways without any
further ado let's go right ahead and go
to the video the first thing you want to
do is apply a primer to your eyelids
because when you're in school um let's
say you have gymnastics or is it PE
physical education I don't know let's
say you have to move a lot in the
morning like your first hour um and
you're just rocking your eyeshadow and
or your entire makeup and stuff and
you're like yeah and then after PE or
gymnastic you look like you've been
murdered so what I suggest is using a
primer on your eyelids to keep your
eyeshadows intact and what I am using is
my soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac the first
color I'm going to take is a buck from
The Naked 1 palette and with this I'm
going to start defining my crease now to
take naked eye shadow with that I'm
defining the inside the inner part of my
crease a little bit more I often get
questions about why I go all the way in
with my crease my eyes are slightly
hooded so when I go all the way in I
kind of feel as if I have more of like
an almond deep-set eyes shape taking
naked only I am now going to blend the
edges of this entire crew shape that we
created taking buck only I'm going to
run that along my lower lash line and go
like halfway in and then for this outer
part I'm going to make it a round circle
shape so normally or a lot of people
like to go out in sort of like a V so
we're we're going to make it a C and go
round I feel like that's a little bit
more natural and a little bit more young
switching over to the Naked 2 palette
I'm going to take chopper and apply that
with a damp brush I adored this color it
is so gorgeous so glamorous
makes you look like a movie star and I
just leave the outer third bare because
on that outer third I'm reapplying buck
eyeshadow from The Naked 1 palette
as a brow bone highlight I am going to
use a foxy and for my inner corner
highlight I definitely suggest this
because this opens up your eyes like no
other I am going to use half-baked and
booty call
and I'm going to mix the two together
and apply those with a damp brush as
well I'm quickly going to apply my Ben
Nye neutralizer cream crayon to my
waterline I choose this over white
because I think white is too stark and
too fake and a nude color is much more
natural and pretty
I'm not going to curl my lashes with my
shoe and wear eyelash curler and then
after that I'm going to apply a mascara
and this is the makeup studio waterproof
3d extra black this is my absolute
favorite my mom sells it in their
webshop and it's insanely good it's it
holds the curl it makes it black makes
your lashes longer volume love it for my
cheeks as you know I can't live with
that contouring for my contour I use my
NYX blush in taupe this is my favorite
contour color for light-skinned people
and then to warm it up a little bit more
I use my Illamasqua disobey blush
however the actual blush itself I mix
two colors together this is the NYX
blush in peach and I mix it together
with my neck pinky blush and together
they make such a nice like cute flush
and then of course you know I love glowy
skin and highlighters and stuff and for
that I use my extra dimension skin
finish by Mac in suburi
for my lips I'm going to take a new mac
lipstick this is pink pearl pop and it
looks really really bright in in in like
bright looks really really bright like
that if it's too much for you you can
always go ahead and go on top with some
lip arrays
now I also came up with two little
outfits that maybe can help you find
inspiration for your first outfit or
like a couple of outfits for your first
week what usually happened to me was I
looked good on the first day and I look
like crap on my school photo so I came
up with two outfits that can maybe give
you some inspiration so let's just go
right ahead to my hallway and show you
the clothes that I came up with my white
blouse with raccoon print is by a sauce
I am obsessed with this underneath I'm
just wearing a simple black tank by only
and the necklace is by a sauce as well
because neon pink is one of my most
favorite colors I chose to make my
outfit a little bit more fun with my
forever 21
plus-size neon pink shorts the bag is by
the oh so awesome shoe mint shoe mint is
known for their duh shoes but I don't
think a lot of you know they have
amazing bags as well I got this back
called the carry-all totes and I think
this is perfect for days where you don't
have a lot of hours in school for me
Fridays were the best I mean on Fridays
I had like five hours of lessons and
then I was done so I had to take like
three books
Shuman is a website where you take a
personal quiz and out of that quiz you
kind of get a bunch of like shoes and
bags and stuff that fits your style the
best and that way she mning kind of
knows what kind of style you have so
that's pretty neat remember rachel
bilson from the OC she and Steve Madden
yes
theif Steve Madden they kind of work
together on all of these shoes and voila
you get perfection anyway go check
Schulman out they have some really
really cool stuff this Kari Aalto bag by
Schumann retails for 79 $98
my boots are by Sasha and I love these
now between you and I these were from
the men's section I don't care I love
them the lack studded boots pure heaven
my second and last outfit was kind of on
the basic side but we all have our basic
days right
the white bus is by nerdstrom and I
probably butchered that I think it's
Swedish or Norwegian I dunno knits to
them and the shirts and necklace are by
a sauce now these shoes let's talk about
the shoes these are the unive
hellraisers and i cannot even talk about
it it's like oh my god crap I love love
love these I'm like I'm obsessed with
them like oh oh well max appeared hi
these shoes are like my personal
hedgehogs from hell I love them
left it's called salt and the right is
called pepper let me know in the
comments if you want a video on these
shoes because I'm obsessed with them and
I could talk about them for like 30
minutes straight the purses bye forever
21 again for the lighter days where you
don't have to carry a lot of books and
that is basically if we're outfit number
two so yeah guys that were the outfits
and the makeup and all the things I came
