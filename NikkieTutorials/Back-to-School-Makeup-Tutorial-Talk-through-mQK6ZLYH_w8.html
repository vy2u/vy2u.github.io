hey guys today I'm doing a tutorial an
in-depth tutorial on a fresh and easy
back to school makeup look this is
definitely for the people who love
wearing makeup to school personally I I
was 14 when I started my youtube channel
on here and I was 14 so I was still in
school and uh basically around the time
I became 15 I started to obsess with
makeup more and more so I actually put
my alarm like a half hour earlier to
actually play with makeup in the morning
at school I kind of was the girl that
had different eyeshadows on every single
day and I I saw every day as an
experimental day for eyeshadows I see it
today I'm going to do a fresh and easy
in depth back to school makeup look
I'm keeping it more on the wearable side
it's definitely it's I'm wearing makeup
you can tell that I'm wearing makeup
this is not a no makeup makeup look but
I still try to keep it really youthful
and fresh and glowy and radiant and I
really really like this look if you want
to know how to get this fresh and easy
in depth back-to-school look that please
keep watching okay the first thing we're
going to be doing for the face is
priming it I wish I would have known
back in the day what priming was I I did
play a lot with makeup when I was
younger and when I was in high school
but I never knew what priming for a face
could do let's say you have a more dry
skin you can prime it by giving it more
moisture and therefore the foundation
will look better on top of it if you
have more of an oily skin type you can
prime it which fights back the oils and
keeps it at bay there at the entire day
and your makeup last longer my skin
today is a little bit of a battlefield
and it also feels very drying today so I
need something that locks in that
moisture that keeps that moisture in the
entire day plus it has to make the
makeup that I put on top lasts all day
long and look beautiful what I find
works best for that is my Mac
prep and prime natural radiance in
radiant yellow they also have a pink one
but I just like yellow I'm just going to
take a few pumps of that and apply that
to my entire face and just gently rub it
in if you have an oily skin type you
might want to add a little bit of makeup
setting spray right now I'm not going to
because I find that these can be a bit
drying for a foundation today I also
want to really encourage you guys to not
go too far with it we all know those
typical girls you know the popular girls
with like pancake faces black kohl
eyeliner inside their eyes in its six
meters below it spider lashes and awful
eyebrows so I really want to urge you
guys to not go too far with your base of
course you can pack it all a little bit
more if you have a little bit more of a
problem skin but still keep it thin
wearable and traceless I'm today going
to use a BB cream and this is the super
plus BB cream triple function by skin79
is just the orange BB cream from skin79
and I'm going to take it and dot it on
my face now it's safer to first dot some
of the products onto your face and then
buff it in and then look at what else
you need it's safer to do that instead
of you know gunking up the products on
your face and then at the end being like
oh that's way too much
you can definitely apply this with your
fingers it saves you time it saves you
money it's not my preferred technique
because I just don't really like using
my fingers for foundation the base I'm
so I'm going to go with a brush this is
my Sigma this is the flat kabuki SAT
brush and with that I'm going to buff
that BB cream in
once that's bustin it's time for
concealer so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to use a concealer that lasts so
long plus it just gives me an amazing
coverage I'm talking about the Mac Pro
Longwear and nc15 but if you do not have
that you can also go for the NYX HD
photogenic concealer which I really
really love as well and they come in a
bunch of colors but I'm just going to go
for the Mac on today and you want to
place it underneath your eyes and also
in this inner corner right here and I
like to swoop it up to the the sides of
my eyes here you don't have to do that
at all but you can the option is there
and I'm going to buff that in with yet
another brush and that is the Sigma f-86
tapered kabuki brush and you just want
to start tapping it in there and diffuse
that concealer out okay now what I like
to do is set this to make it last all
day long so I'm just going to take a
little bit of my favorite powder and I'm
going to take a little tiny teeny brush
and I'm just going to lightly set that
concealer underneath my eyes and then
what I do now is let that foundation
rest and really the sink into my face so
bad and then do brows and then come back
and finish it all off with powder that
way the front is you can really settle
and sink into the skin and do its job
and then you can powder it and make it
last all day long so I'm going to do
brows now and I'm just going to use my
usual products of the brow is by
Anastasia and a little bit of dip brow
pomade in taupe so I'm going to make a
mixture of that and do my brows so I'm
going to do that off camera I have a
full tutorial on that if you want to
know how I do them and then we'll be
back okay one of the most important
things you want to do when it comes to
your eyes its priming them it's the same
as the skin if you want something to
last you want to prime it there are a
bunch of primers to choose from but my
favorite is by Mac and it's a Paint Pot
and this is called soft ochre and I like
applying this just by taking my finger
and then just start typing it onto the
lid then wipe and
axes off and start buffing all that you
have on your lid in and it's really
important to not forget that bottom part
of your eyes and for the eyes one I want
to be doing is defining them but not
going too far and still having a little
bit of glamour because the glamour is
all it lately so we need some glam up in
here and because my eyes are somewhat
smaller and I don't have a lot of crease
I really want some definition in my
crease I'll be taking kid eyes shadow by
Mac and I'll be applying that softly to
my crease so just with a big blending
brush define your crease just a tad bit
more then I take under cover from the
lorac unzipped palette and with that I
just love to highlight I highlight my
brow bone with this so blending it with
that kit color and I also love opening
up the inner portion of my eye so the
inner corners it just this color works
perfectly for that because it just opens
up your eyes and makes you look super
super healthy and wide-awake and you
know ready to take them books now you
could stop here because you have that
definition in your crease and you have
highlighted so you look a little bit
more wide awake but I want to add a
little bit of glam and more definition
so I'll be taking a wet and wild trio
and this is called walking on eggshells
and I love these colors right here so
I'm going to make a mixture between the
brow bone color and the eyelid color and
just with my finger I'm going to apply
those to my lid meeting up with the
crease color that kid color and I love
these colors on the lid because they're
still very light reflective and glam but
they're not too much and not too
overpowering meaning that they're
perfect for school because you can still
look glam without going too little or
too much for the bottom lash I'm going
to take that crease color and I'm just
placing this really closely
to the roots of my lower lashes and
slightly work my way in and then for the
tiniest bit of a wing slash more
definition and flirt I'm going to take
that same color and from that lower lash
line drag it out so you have a nice
little wing going on and drag it back in
to create a wing and then you just want
to create a nice haze around the edges
to smoke it in and make it less harsh
and I really like doing this because it
gives you the illusion of a nice wing
but it's still very soft wearable and
totally okay for school and lastly you
want to apply mascara to really make
your eyes speak and you want to go top
and bottom just to make it look really
flirty and nice and young and fresh the
mascara so I'll be using our my makeup
studio what approved 3d index or black
and I'm also applying a bit of this
Korean brand mascara this is by Holika
Holika I believe and it's the magic pull
mascara so I'm going to apply that to my
lashes top and bottom and then it will
be back okay so for cheeks I think the
most important thing to remind yourself
of is that less is more when it comes to
cheeks and high school I personally did
a little bit of contouring already
because my face just needs contouring
and I'm still going to use a little bit
of bronzer bronzer is always a good
option it makes you look a warm and
healthy and radiant so a little bit of
bronzer is never a bad idea
so I'm going to go with my Illamasqua
disobey and I'm just going to focus it
on my forehead tops of cheekbones and
then just kind of make a three out of it
so you start at your forehead go to the
top of your cheek chin jawline sorry
okay for blush I want to go for
something radiant and happy and healthy
and I'm going to go for my mineralized
blush by Mac called ding tee for the out
and put it on the apples of your cheeks
and then blend
ding back for me personally highlighting
is a must because I feel like when you
go little on the eyes and you go little
on the lips later on and you go little
on the skin you definitely do want to
have that radiant glow and I just think
that the less makeup you wear and the
more glow you have the the prettier gets
so I'm going to highlight using my mac
mineralize skinfinish in soft and gentle
and the tiniest bit of Becca's
shimmering skin Perfector in moonstone
and you want to focus this on the
highest points of your cheekbones right
at the side of your eyes
and then what I like to do is take a
more concentrated brush and smile and
you kind of see this light reflective
thing popping up you kind of want to
highlight there as well underneath your
eyes onto the cheeks because that just
makes you look glowy you have no idea
for lips you want to go with something
that you can easily throw in your bag
and touch up throughout the day and I'm
going to go with my NYX jumbo lip pencil
in 717 and it's called Irish coffee and
it's just a beautiful peachy pink color
it's nude but it has a punch of color
and it's a little bit of glossy and it's
it just it wears nicely and it just
looks really good on the lips so just
slap it on
and that guy's concludes this in-depth
easy back-to-school fresh makeup
tutorial I hope you enjoyed I hope you
have an amazing first week at school and
if you already had a first week at
school I hope you have an amazing year

yourself and you you get through this
and eventually school is over and then
you can go crazy with makeup I guess so
