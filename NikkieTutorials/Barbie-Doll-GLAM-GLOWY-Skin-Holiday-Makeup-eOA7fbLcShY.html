pink holiday glam makeup look it's what
I would call it pretty much I received
this awesome liquid lipstick by BH
Cosmetics and I loved the color so much
that I wanted to create a look around it
so I came up because it reminds me so
much of Barbie and the holidays are
coming up so I was like why not do a
Barbie holiday look
see I just started playing with glitter
and eyeliner and that awesome lip and of
course glowy skin so if you would like
to know I have to get this makeup look
right here then please keep on watching
oh yes okay I'm gonna change things up a
little bit today I'm not only going to
use my navy MN aftershave balm in
sensitive to prime my face but because
I'm a little bit more dry from all the
makeup these last couple of days I'm
also going to add in a couple of drops
of the cover FX custom infusion drops
and I'm using the one in C plus
lemongrass so I'm going to make a
mixture between these two and that not
only will give me a primer that will
keep my makeup on all day long but also
hydrate now I'm going to follow through
using my Smashbox photo finish primer
water for foundation it shouldn't come
as a surprise so that we go in for my
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD sticks these
just give me the most fabulous flawless
finish and that's what I'm here for
today I'm applying 1:20 to the outer
perimeter of muffins
and 117 to the inner muchacha Tivo hmm
super and wenden using a Beauty Blender
so I recorded a video late at night last
night and it didn't turn out to be
amazing so I ended up not keeping it for
winter wonder week and I used a
different foundation in that and it took
me back to thinking oh my gosh I love
the foundation sticks so much because
they're so much quicker easier prettier
more flawless so because I'm filming
again today I was like no I'm going back
to those sticks because they rock my
world
for concealer of course it cosmetics bye
bye under-eye
in light
and of course again blend in using that
purely blender and I'm gonna set it with
powder to prevent it from creasing
as always first thing I'll be doing is
priming and for this up using my soft
ochre Paint Pot by Mac
then now like always I'm going to set my
crease the brow bone area using a matte
nude eyeshadow and this will help
blending later on now be going into my
BH Cosmetics modern matte palette and
are we taking these two colors right
here
privileged em now first going to apply a
white gel liner as a base to really make
my eyelids pop now going in with the BH
Cosmetics wild and free baked eyeshadow
palette and taking this beautiful color
right here and I'm applying this with a
damp brush over that wide base on the
lid now let's focus on that fun liner
I'm going in with my Kat Von D tattoo
liner in trooper to make my line from
the tip of the line drag it back onto
the lash line now from the inner corner
drag the line towards the middle and
connect the two now fill in using the
Sigma line ace in legend now it's time
for that awesome pink glitter I'm going
in with my Urban Decay heavy metal
glitter liner in junk show first as a
base and we're working in sections here
I'm first applying junk show and then
applying my OCC glitter over top and the
first color I'll be going in with is
pink
now follow through using junk show and
then the glitter over top will be OCC
magenta once you've applied the glitter
go back in with your cavity tattoo liner
and kind of outline the glitter so you
have a nice outline glitter liner to
open up the inner corners dramatically
I'm going back in with that white gel
liner and really open them up and
setting it with this light pink red here
now with these two shades right here I'm
going to define my lower lash line a
softly bit
and all you want to do not to finish off
are some lashes and these are the Hooda
Beauty Naomi's okay on two cheeks the
first thing I'll be doing is contouring
use my NYX blush in taupe
do you warm up my cheeks a little I'll
be using the Too Faced milk-chocolate
bronzer
for my glow today of course tis the
season for porcelain holy Christmas tree
I started using this brush for
highlighter because of amrezy and makeup
Shayla and Ho Lee Christmas tree life
has been given and for the record this
is the morphe m3 ten
for blush I'm using Mac's peaches
and now with my skin the Navy I make a
finishing setting spray I'm just going
to spritz all the excessive powder away
for lips I'm first going to line them
using mac cosmetics world lip pencil
and for lipstick Alan Eustace awesome
new BH Cosmetics liquid lipsticks they
send me their entire collection of
liquid lipsticks so I kind of base my
look around this one because this is my
favorite they have a gray one SoDo this
is the gray one this is called muse so
