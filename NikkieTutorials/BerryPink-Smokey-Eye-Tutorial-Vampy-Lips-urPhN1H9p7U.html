tutorial on this makeup look right here
this is very smokey purpley smoky berry
eyes and sampie dark lips I felt like
playing with color and darkness today
after doing so many neutral looks with
the pop of lip or nude lips and just I
felt like color there's color here see
if you'd like to know how to get this
look right here then please keep on
watching as always the first thing I'll
be doing is applying a base to my
eyelids to prevent everything from
creasing I'll be using my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot for this the first eyeshadow
I'll be using is by Anasazi Beverly
Hills and this is the artist palette and
I'm taking this color right here called
dusty Rhodes and this color is going
directly in to the crease and because
we're doing the smokey look I'm going to
go all the way in to my inner corners
now going in with this sugarpill pigment
called countess and I'm applying this
with a damp brush and I'm applying this
on the inner portion of my lid blending
it up into the crease and also on the
harder portion of the lid blending up
into the crease and of course you want
to give that a lovely blend on the
center of the lid I'll be applying punch
fuchsia and blend it in with the
sugarpill pigment
for the lower lashline I'll first go in
with aubergine now focusing this more on
the outer portion of my lower lash line
from the Urban Decay electric palette
I'm taking Savage and what's this called
jilted and that's going right here but
inner corner for a pop of color and fall
out then taking a little bit of coal and
deepening the outer corners I'm taking
the bulbs mary-lou manizer to highlight
my inner corners off-camera on the
waterline I'll be applying a black kohl
I can't do this on camera I just I just
can't and that's it for the eyes I'm not
going to finish off by applying some
falsies today I'll be using these right
here these are by Lena lashes and these
are called Claudia for cheeks the first
thing I'll be doing of course
contouring I'll be using what Kevin e
shade and light palette for this to
bronze up my face I'm taking this Tarte
Park as princess palette this is palette
number one and this is the contour
palette and I'm just going to use the
bronzer to warm up my complexion
a little bit on my forehead there's a
lot of it for blush I'll be taking this
one by girl and I'm going in with this
color first and giving a shimmer to my
complexion using that one ooh I love
that
just with the bigger brush and that
second color adding that warmth and glow
hair adding that warmth and glow to my
face for my highlight today I'll be
using the ball mary lou manizer just
because I used it on the inner corners
why not use it on the rest of my face
and of course some of the tip of my nose
mmm my favorite trick to do this really
that tip of the nose highlight is really
what makes me love a look it just
completes the entire look it just ties
it all in together I just I cannot live
with my nose highlight for lips I wanted
to make this look super vampy and smoky
and dark so let's do that with the lips
also hello can we focus right here right
Ephron eeeh thank you free lipstick
today I'm actually going to use a liquid
lipstick this is by Anasazi of Beverly
Hills this is the color sad girl but
ain't nobody gets a girl with this color
on their lips
and overtop a little tiny bit of Anasazi
Beverly Hills Heather's liquid lipstick
