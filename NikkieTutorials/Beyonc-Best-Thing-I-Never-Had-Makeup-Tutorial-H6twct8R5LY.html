on Beyonce's best thing I never had
music video um it was absolutely the
freshest cutest thing ever she is so
pretty she is just too gorgeous for this
planet I'm going to show you how good
foundation and how you gonna play with
shine on your face to make it look even
healthier um yeah so we're going to use
sleek and a little bit of been 9 a
little bit of neck today and the sleek
is from Ellis and Joe have the Central's
link is in the info box so if you want
to know how I did this look then please
keep on watching ok so I already
moisturize my skin with the Dermalogica
intensive moisture balance moisturizer
now for the skin I want a really fresh
kind of dewy clean looking base for that
I'm going to use 2 for nations this is
the MEC fate somebody in c1 to give
myself just a teeny tiny bit more
coverage I'm going to use the skin base
foundation from comes with that the skin
makes foundation from Illamasqua
is brand new oh but before I do that I'm
first gonna put on a primer this is max
prep and prime in skin base B side and
then with my Louise young foundation
brush I'm just gonna apply that to the
skin
for concealer I'm going to use this
derma color come flage meanie pella that
I have about this epic state I'm just
going to take my color and put some
concealer under my eyes and on spots for
it I need it because Beyonce had perfect
skin with the highlights on the perfect
places I'm just gonna take my Mac pearl
cream color Bates for the perfect Sheen
and pet it on the top of the cheekbones
on the top of my nose Cupid's bow now
for setting powder I know this
foundation is really shiny but I kind of
like that finish it want to keep the
like the overall feeling of this face
nice fresh and shiny not like a fried
chicken not like a grease ball just
healthy shine and I'm just going to take
some powder and just set it to give it a
less greaseball feeling but more of a
natural glow and you want to Pat the
powder in under my eyes a little bit on
my chin a little bit on the sides of my
nose my nose itself I'm just a little
bit on the cheeks so you have a really
nice natural sheen on your face but it
isn't like you are agrees ball or fried
chicken from KFC for a blush she just
had the perfect like glowy skin so again
I'm just gonna take a glowy blush this
is NEX warm so blush it's the best blush
on the market it just fits everyone two
more up the back of my face so just
right here and then blend it forward and
I'm just gonna do my brows I has a video
on that it's kind of changed now a bit
but I will do an updated version soon
because always first apply a base on
this is soft ochre Paint Pot from MEK
and especially in his makeup like this
because if you are wearing this to your
wedding
you want your eyeshadows to stay on the
entire day
the palette we're using today is this
sleek oh so special palette and the
coloring on the start of with is the
lightest highlighting color right there
and I'm just gonna put that on to my lid
and onto the brow bone then the second
color notes it's this dark purpley color
um I'm just going to use a angled brush
on that some MEK and what you want to do
is place his color as close to your lash
line as possible and after that you're
gonna blend it out first just start
placing it as close to the lash line as
possible just for a little bit more
definition can't add a little wing
that's always flattering and I'm gonna
take a pencil brush and I'm going to
blend that out completely you really
just want this as a little bit of color
along the lash line for more thicker
lashes and just a little bit more
definition to the eye I'm gonna blend
that outer point just a little bit into
my crease for a little bit more
definition as well but you definitely
don't want a lot of definition in the
crease it's just really really clean now
I'm going to take the card next is to
you the color that we used and just keep
blending it out now this color right
here I'm gonna make it even softer by
blending that on top of the colors to
make it less there and it will make you
help blend everything then I'm going
back with the purpley car again because
we lost a little bit too much of that
intensity so just along the lash line
make it more intense and for the lower
lash line I'm going to use a color from
neck this is corduroy and with the
pencil brush again just really lightly
sweep
on the outer third like right there now
for the beautiful glowing inner corner
highlight I'm going to take this Ben Nye
eyeshadow again from that night held it
from next stage and this is called ice
and you just want to put that on to the
inner corners blend it up a bit and then
also right here in the tear duct area
but as you can see it's a little bit too
much right now so I'm going to blend
that out okay what I'm now going to do
is add some nude eyeliner pencil to my
waterline just to open up the eyes a
little bit more this is Illamasqua bow
okay and then I'm going to curl my
lashes with my Japan s eyelash curler
and use some waterproof mascara this is
makeup studio's water-resistant Volume
Mascara and I'm only going to apply some
mascara to my up depth to my top lashes
because that will make it more natural
and more wearable so I'm gonna do that
all and then I'm going to be back for
the lips so for the lips they were just
really natural and just with the kind of
flush of color and glossy so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take my
Chanel lipstick and if s to them and I'm
gonna put that all over my lips I do
have a little bit of foundation left I'm
was just okay because that will make it
look more natural and then for a sheen
just for a shiny gloss I'm gonna use the
Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream just like
that so that completes this Beyonce
besting I never had a makeup tutorial
I'm so yep that completes this look for
fullest of all traffic to go to my
