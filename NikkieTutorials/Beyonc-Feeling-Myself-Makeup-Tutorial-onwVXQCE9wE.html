tutorial inspired by Beyonce from her
new music video feeling myself featuring
Nicki Minaj I was living for that super
simple glam look that she was rocking
when when they look at each other and
they go like Beyonce is rocking this
super gorgeous understated glam look
it's all about the glowy bronzy skin
super soft wide awake eyes and these
bold vampy brick colored lips stand
without any further ado if you would
like to know how to get this beyonce
Queen B makeup look then please stay
tuned
so of course Queen B has amazing
flawless skin so the first thing going
in with is my Nivea men sensitive
aftershave balm this is the perfect
primer on the market I've talked about
it in many videos before so just check
back to my older videos then following
through using my Smashbox primer water
for foundation you want to go SuperDuper
dewy and healthy and glowing so I'm
going to make a mixture I'm going to go
in with my Cogan Jo aqua foundation in
213 and also a little bit of this Rimmel
match perfection foundation this is
number 100 ivory
after that glow I'll be mixing in a
liquid highlighter this is by Becca and
this is the Becca shimmering skin
Perfector in pearl and I'll be buffing
that mixture in using my Sigma s 88
for concealer my trusty old mac
prolongwear kidding okay guys I'm going
to use the NARS radiant creamy concealer
then I'm going to do this first and
under my eyes last because I find that
the rating creamy concealer can become
quite hard to work with once you are too
slow with it gotta work fast with this
concealer
the first thing I'm going to do for my
eyes is Prime and therefore I'm taking
the Mac soft ochre Paint Pot now I'm
taking the bulbs nude tude palette and
I'm taking seductive and just with a
fluffy blending brush this is a dupe for
the 217 by Mac this is going all over
the lid as a wash of bronze and then
smoke it out up into the crease then
with a clean brush this is the Sigma e35
I'm just blending out the edges on top
of that a little bit of stand offish
just using that same brush I'm going to
dust it over top a seductive and this
will give you that lovely Sheen for the
inner corners at first using this the
balm pigment this is called no money no
honey and intensifying that inner corner
highlight using this ven night pigment
in ice
on the waterline I'm applying a white
eye Kohl and I'll be doing this
off-camera and then I have to finish off
the eyes all you want to do is apply
mascara and falsies for falsies today
I'm going to use these these are by
house of lashes and they're called own
natural and they're just going to apply
mascara to top and bottom and these on
top and then we got that and the
sculpting contour my face today using my
Kevin E shade and light palette
for bronzer I'm going to use Mac's give
me Sun and beheaded mostly centered on
the higher planes of her face not as
much in her contour and bronzing up her
entire complexion it was more so placed
around the temples and the highs tops of
the cheekbones so just taking a little
bit of that bronzer and basically I'm
just swirling it onto the sides of my
face that is where I want to look the
most bronzy over top of that for a glow
for a bronzy glow I'm taking this Mac
extra dimension skin finish and glorify
I'm just picking that up and going right
over top where I applied the bronze at
and I'm actually going to use that as a
little bit of a blush also I'm taking my
the ball mary lou manizer and this is
going everywhere so first off this is
going onto the highest points of my
cheekbones blend it in then also about
the arch of your brow look at that yes
come through highlighter come through
Cupid's bow a little bit on the chin
tiny bit and I'm also going to highlight
the tip of my nose and to intensify that
even more I'm taking mac's fix+ and just
spritzing the highlighted areas look at
that I love highlighter for lips I'm
going to use two liquid lipsticks by
dose of colors the first one is brick
this is what brick looks like right here
is a very nice brick it's like an actual
brick color and to make that a little
bit more red because these lips were
brick colored but still a little bit
more on the red side so to mix it I'm
using a merlot buy does the color so
together this will make Beyonce
and that guy's concludes my beyoncé
featuring Nicki Minaj feeling myself
