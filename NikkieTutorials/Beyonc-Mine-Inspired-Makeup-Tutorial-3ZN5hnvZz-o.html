tutorial on this look right here and
this is inspired / recreated by
Beyonce's preview music video called
mine featuring Drake I got so many
requests for this I even got requests
for it on my blog I never get requests
on my blog and so when I got that
requests on my blog I was like okay I
need to do it I wasn't sure if I was
gonna do blo music video or a mine music
video so I put on a pull on my website
niggas tutorials calm and with like a
whopping result of 90% for my music
video I decided to go for that one I
absolutely love it it's so gorgeous it
is so colorful yet um it's dark and
smoky so perfect for a party but it's it
has color and color is always a good
thing so yeah I decided to recreate that
look of Beyonce's my music video and if
you want to know how to get this done
please keep watching okay so the first
thing you want to do is supply base here
eyelets to prevent the eyeshadow from
creasing and I'm using my Mac soft ochre
paint pop for that okay now from my
lorac Pro unzipped palette I'm gonna
take my unconditional eyeshadow and very
softly with that start defining your
crease a bit and we're going all the way
in and this is going to be a beautiful
transition color for the blue and the
purple to give it a nice soft pink touch
I'm going to take feather pink eyeshadow
by Mac and slightly above unconditional
blent this in as well and this will give
an amazing pink touch and later on we're
gonna make it a little bit more extreme
to just add in more now I'm going to
take this sparkly midnight blue color
right here this is called mystery I have
no idea what the brand is I actually got
this from eBay and I do not know what
the brand is it's just eBay midnight
blue sparkle and somehow the name is
mystery and it's a beautiful color
you're going to apply this to the inner
third of the lid so this inner part
right here one third of the lid goes
from the beginning to the first half of
the iris and then you have the middle
which is it to of the third and then you
have three of the three
which is the outside and then also put
this on the outer third matching the
other half of the iris like that now
going to take shop and drop eyeshadow by
Mac and with this place it really
closely to the root of your lower lash
line and then we're going to use this as
a guide for the shape of the entire eye
so from there take it out upwards and
this will be a great guideline for how
we want our shape of the eye to be so
this is the shape I'm going to work with
and then fill in and then from there you
can shop and drop and that mystery color
and blend out that case in a really nice
way and then go in your creases well
really lightly above that gap and then
just slightly build your crease in to
Frigga blend this is going to take sugar
pills poison plum and apply that to the
other half of my crease so right here
where the blue stops and the pink begins
apply poison plum by sugarpill and that
will act as a beautiful transition color
as well and it just adds so much color
and life into the look I love it okay
taking shop and drop again darkening the
very outer parts of the eye so this very
inner corner here in this outer part
here remember how I was talking about
said they're pink we're gonna go back
into the color and add more pink to give
it a nice gradient effect so edit above
poison plum and give it a really sort of
nice halo effect like it's really
glowing above the smoky eye then go back
in with poison plum your purple and
reapply that to make it more vibrant and
blend it with the pink you can sort of
see a really nice gradient coming along
for that pop of blue I'm going to take
Cavill blue loose color pigment by OCC
and apply
to the part that doesn't have any shadow
yet and just oh my God look at the color
holy crap holy blue crab so just pack it
on and go up till the crease and then
sort of fill that entire gap up with the
blue then wipe your brush off really
important and then what you want to do
is put your brush at the border of the
dark blue and the bright blue and then
sort of wiggle it to blend it to really
give it a nice seamless blend now take
more of that blue because it's not
bright enough
we need more again pack it on boom blue
wipe that brush off and dusted for the
bottom lid I'm going to take sugar pills
darling pigment and I'm going to apply
this wet and it is so studying and just
apply that really closely to the roots
of the lashes and go all the way to the
inner corner okay then take that darker
blue color again and blend it into words
darling pigment and then you have a
really nice sort of blend between those
two this look is all about blending
y'all okay what you want to do now is
sparkle up that inner corner and for
that I will be using my gel effects in
shine by makeup studio and with this you
want to take some and just place it on
the very inner corner and kind of dab it
out a bit okay to open up my eyes I'll
be using my crease made to stay inside I
highlighter pen and all you want to do
now is the place of mascara and the
mascara so we'll be using our my makeup
studio waterproof 3dx or black and my
benefits they're real okay for cheeks
you want to do a soft contour because
Beyonce was wearing a really soft blush
and really soft contour and a lot of
shine Queen Bee knows how to glow so to
contour my face I'm going to use my
Illamasqua heroine eyeshadow and um
since I do not have the bone structure
or the face or the like low amount
effect that the
se has I'm going to contact the crap out
of my face then to warm up my face a
little bit more I'm going to take the
usual which is new - more bronzer by Mac
and then just warm it up okay for blush
I'm going to keep it really soft and
cute and not too much I'm going to take
sex appeal by NARS and then at the Dutch
drugstores I recently found an amazing
product this is by essence and this is
called the metal glam highlighter powder
and it's just the most stunning
champagne golden glow in a pot so that
is what I'm going to use as my
highlighter so first take a little bit
and put it on the highest points of your
cheeks and then also do your nose free
lips you want to keep stuff really
natural I think Beyonce was just wearing
a little bit of gloss um but I can do
that I just need more in my life so I'm
going to dab a little bit of Mac's flash
pot lipstick on my lips to make them
nude and then as my lip gloss I'm going
to use boy bait by Mac and this is a
cream machine glass
and that guy's completes this Beyonce
mind preview music video inspired makeup

album stick it's like only Queen Bee
