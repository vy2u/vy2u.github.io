Beyonce's party music video look in the
pool but I wanted to show you guys is
this a friend site I wanted to show you
guys these ladies got heart beats by dr.
dre yes I got these from my life my life
is sort of like a sponsored videos you
can get products offered from them and
then you can make a video about it I
just have to show them oh because
they're amazing they look like that it's
sort of like it's I always thought that
they were that there were studs on it
but it is more of like a print can see
those stars are the way from here I
don't know what I'm saying and every
time you touched me I just melt away so
you can find them at the dr. Dre website
it will put it in my infobox
there are about $45 I love them so if
you want to see how I did this man to
love them please keep on watching okay
so I know that I say this in every
single video but I have to say it
because she kind of to do it with every
single look that you do but the first
thing I'm going to do is put a primer on
my eyelids to prevent the eyeshadow from
creasing and the one I'm using is my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot so the first I
should I'm going to take is this one
from my Inglot palette and I'm going to
take this one and that is number 340 and
with a really really small eye to the
brush like this I'm just going to start
off by putting some of the color on the
outer part of my eyes so first I'm just
going to make a line right here
and then I'm gonna make the wing for
this part right here I'm just gonna
follow the direction of my waterline
okay from that point go into your crease
just look straight for it and just make
a line
on your crease almost and what I'm going
to do is I'm going to wing that outer
part a little bit more out just to give
it a more flattering look for my eye
shape like that okay from that I'm going
to go back into that crease and then
just from that point right here
make a line all the way to the inner
corners of my eyes for an eyeliner just
an eyeliner course fill it in
I'm now going to take max eyeshadow in
mystery and it's a really nice cool
brown and I'm just going to like draw a
line on my crease and just a little bit
above because else it will just fall
away so as you can see I kind of had a
little bit above it so that is what I'm
going to do on that side as well
I'm gonna go back into that in clock
color and I'm kind of going to blend the
halves in so I'm going to blend that
bluish Clark in I'm going to wipe the
brush off and I'm going to go back into
mystery and kind of like when you were a
kid and you did that was like drawing
this where you just had to color in the
blocks and stuff you're gonna do that
with this as well
so just color this in with mystery so
now it's kind of goth so we're going to
highlight it for highlighting colors I'm
going to take this neck I shadow in
setting taupe and for my line it's
highlighting color I'm going to take
this color and this is retro spec from
Mac okay so I'm going to take settings
help and I'm gonna highlight the like
middle of my lid and kind of you just
you know just highlight it there so
first I'm gonna put it on dry which is
pretty decent pretty it's pretty pretty
I'm gonna wet my brush and apply it a
little bit more wet for the bottom I'm
going to take a white eyeliner this is
Illamasqua elate and I'm going to
highlight the inner corners of my lower
lid to really make that purple that is
going on top pop the purple that I'm
going to use is poison plum from
sugarpill
the last step I'm going to apply it some
black eye Kohl to my waterline just
really make them black black then apply
some mascara and the one I'm using is my
trusty old makeup studio what a
resistant volume and then I'm happy
Beckford a glittery pink glossy lips
okay and that fertile lips Beyonce was
wearing a really really bright pink
glittery gloss it almost looks like a
L'Oreal campaign I am going to make my
own lip gloss and I'm gonna do that is
I'm going to take my Elizabeth Arden 8
hour cream which is a really nice a
shiny product and it's a lip treatment
or just a treatment on its own and what
I'm going to do is I'm going to mix the
Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream with
lipsticks and glitter and that will kind
of make it a really nice glossy texture
and I'm just going to Pat that on my
lips so the cars that I'm going to use
for this lip gloss are just a really
bright pink that I have my English allit
I don't know the name but I will put it
on my website or comm and then for
glitter I'm going to take this eye candy
cotton candy sugar cotton candy sugar
glitter
