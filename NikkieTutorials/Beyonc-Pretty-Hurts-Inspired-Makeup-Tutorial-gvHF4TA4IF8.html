tutorial inspired by Beyonce's new music
video pretty hurts
it's one of Beyonce's best music videos
in my opinion Beyonce was rocking a
couple of amazing looks throughout this
entire video but I couldn't decide which
look to film for you guys today so I
took it to Instagram and I posted three
looks and this was the winner of the
entire music video so this is the look
where she's sort of in front of all her
awards and prizes from from you know
pageants and stuff so yeah guys if you
want to know how to get this Beyonce
pretty hurts music video inspired makeup
look and please keep on watching so I
already went ahead and prime my eyelids
using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and
now I'm picking up a little bit of
makeup geeks eyeshadow in latte and I'm
gonna brush a little bit of latte right
here in my crease making it really soft
and diffused for the little bit taking a
little bit of Mac's pressed pigment in
day gleam which is absolutely
fantastically gorgeous and the pressed
pigments work best with fingers so I'm
just dabbing this onto my lid area using
my middle finger and that glitter in it
is just absolutely amazing for my bottom
living going back into my makeup geek
latte eye shadow again and I'm gonna
apply this right here towards the outer
corner of my lower lash line blending
inwards and from the bottom I'm gonna
whoop it up to the sides of my eyes
there for that awesome pop of green I'm
gonna take minted eye Kohl by Mac and
this is going on to the waterline and
you don't want to be neat with this at
all because we're gonna smudge it out
later anyways even to these very inner
corner here and then I'm also gonna
wiggle it in between my bottom lashes
blending it into the latte by makeup
geek to set the green I will make a
mixture between mix
club and makeup geeks Envy so with those
two green colors and going over where I
applied the eye Kohl and making it a
little bit more smudgy and smokey taking
those same two shades and running this
along my upper lash line to ground the
look a little bit more and also with
this and going all the way to the inner
corners and then with a little pencil
brush I'm gonna buff it out here at the
outer corners and blend it up to my
crease right here on the outer part of
my eyes and then what I like to do is
just take that minted I go again and go
over that line kind of sloppily and just
get that color in there a little bit I'm
a quickly highlighting my inner corners
using a bit of Mac's nylon and just
taking a tiny bit of that and popping
that right here on the very inner corner
and then blending out and that's a
finish up that eye look I'm gonna apply
some mascara and for that I'll be using
my makeup studio water put 3d extra
black and a little bit of the Mac
extended play gigablack lash so for
cheeks you know I always do some
contouring prior to filming and so I did
today and for that it's my illamasqua
eyeshadow in heroine and you know what's
coming now warming and bronzing up my
complexion
using my illamasqua blush and disobey
and you definitely want to go for a
really nice bronzy finish because I love
how Beyonce had those really sort of pop
of green eyes and then the bright pink
purpley lips and then that brahms so I'm
just gonna warm up my complexion quite a
bit using a big buffer brush this sing
and the more bronzy neutral use I'm
gonna take this Tarte exposed Amazonian
clay 12-hour blush and I'm gonna use
that as my blush but I'm gonna put it a
little bit more towards the back of my
face
and then to give my face that amazing
Beyonce glow I'm gonna take my whisper
of guild EXO dimension skinfinish by Mac
violets Beyonce of course were that
beautiful magenta color that was also
found in her top that she was wearing
it wasn't applied like super super sharp
or like oh my gosh it's so precise it
looks like it's photoshopped it felt
more as if it was patted on with the
finger and then just really get the
concentration of the color but not like
the perfectness of the Ruffman it kept
it a little bit more edgy so I'm gonna
try to mimic that
so to first get my lips a little bit
more shoosh I'm gonna take the Lokhande
of the pencil by Lancome in beige rose
and a little bit of the lip pencil by
Mac and embrace me because I want this
to be a little bit more pink
now if red lipstick I'm likely gonna tap
on a little bit of sleek makeup amp'd
matte lipstick so I'm just gonna take
that with my finger and just start
tapping then to at the slightest touch
of purple like the slightest bit I'm
gonna take belladonna lips hard bye bye
OCC and you literally want to take the
tiniest tiniest amount because goddamn
that's purple and again start tapping
onto the lips and that guy's concludes
