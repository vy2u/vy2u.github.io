Beyonce's girls who run the world
tutorial video
she had bleached raus green smokey eyes
and nude nude lips so yeah
today I am recreating it look and if you
want to know how I did this then please
keep on watching but before we do that I
want to say that we're using 2bh pellet
again because I know that people want me
to stick to one brand in one video so I
try to so yeah if you want to go my
business then please keep on watching
the first thing you want to do is the
pilot tear I head up to your operation
so the first thing you want to do is
apply a shadow base to your lips to
prevent the eyeshadows from creasing and
I'm going to use the BH Cosmetics eyelid
primer so today I'm using a BH Cosmetics
palette again and this is number three
and and the colors I'm going to start
with are this one right here that one
and that one one okay what I'm going to
do is smoke that under my lower lash
line by just following like the first
half of your iris like that line follow
that like that and if you follow the
direction of your waterline that gives
you like the perfect angle of your
shadow you see how that's giving you the
perfect light direction where you have
to go to and from that point go all the
way into the crease then I'm going to go
into my crease now I'm going to go into
these two colors and blend that line and
especially with bleach brows my trick
for like the blend is to your nose line
that trick makes it look so like
avant-garde and so like rich with a
light bleach for us I love it once you
got that I'm going to take this
shimmering dark green color Pat it on
don't blend it on because if you pat it
on you keep all the pigmentation from
the eye shadow okay once you got that
I'm going to go into the black and put
that on the side that is still untouched
then I'm going to go back into that
green and blend the two together okay
now I'm gonna take max chucks and I'm
just gonna blend that right above where
we have all the dark colors then I'm
also gonna put just into the inner
corners and blended of course so for the
lower lid I'm finishing it with the part
that is on my lid as well the dark green
I'm going to put that on the inner
corners as well and if you really want
to add some drama to it take some black
and make it really smoky beneath for
that lower lash line highlight I'm going
to take been nice pigment in ice Gold
I'm gonna mix it with this English Earl
line which is a really nice mixing
medium and then put that on the inner
corners okay give everything a less
beautiful blend with your blending brush
now I'm going to add some a greenish
dark like eyeliner to my waterline this
is Illamasqua Erin's of course for that
I'm gonna use my liner
okay now I'm going to curl my lashes and
add some mascara and then I will weigh
back for the new do lips for the lips
they were really nude and glossy so I
muted them out with my lip arrays
already and I'm gonna take berry M's 132
and it's called like pink bronzy pinky
Brom I'm just gonna add that on top for
just a little bit of Sheen in color and
then for a gloss I'm gonna take a little
bit of painted on from Mac and that
completes this Beyonce girls who run the
world
yeah so yeah if you want to fool this up

to check out the H pellets they are
