sort of by Beyonce's new music video but
I don't you love me mmm I try to
recreate it as good as I can but she
used a lot more shine but I don't really
love shine on me so I kept it matte and
um yes I used false lashes and every
time you use false lashes I get the
comments like are you cross-eyed I'm not
cross eyes just two false lashes on
that's one of the reasons I never wear
false lashes because one they make me
look cross-eyed do I always ruin my
makeup with it and three I just do not
get them on I hope you guys like this
look and if you want to know I did this
then please people watching
okay so the first thing of course is to
just stop it stop are you done thank you
okay so the first thing you of course
want to do is apply a base to prevent
your item creasing I use this
Miss Helen eyeshadow base and this um
Michael taught nude um I shadow and in
case as a base to because it does
increase at all if you really want a
base that prevents your eyes from
creasing at all like no creasing at all
you should get the Michael taught nude
base um Lincoln's in the sidebar for
where you can get it I love it it's the
best primer I've ever used so thumbs up
for that okay the first thing I'm going
to do is take a 2:39 my Sigma and
vanilla eyeshadow by Mac and I probably
use vanilla in every single video I have
and I don't really care because I love
this color and then that's going on the
inner corners in here as well and I'm
just all over the lid
and I go on to the brow bone as well for
this look you kind of want to cut the
crease because it's really defined a
really sharpened video um the best thing
is to do the liner and then do the cut
crease but I want to do a little bit of
a beginning of the cut crease already so
I'm going to get a stargazer angled brow
brush and it's really thin I'm really
sharp and I'm getting copperplate I
shadow by Mac and getting in there and
just start cutting the crease like in
the middle so for me you want to go here
like that then go in that
and then go like that see now you have a
really basic line and what I thought was
more easy to just keep doing the shadows
is to first make that line that winged
eyeliner and then go from there on so
we're going to do the liner I'm gonna
zoom you guys in and jutted line now for
the eyeliner I'm going to use glam eyes
liquid eyeliner by Rimmel London this is
my favorite liquid eyeliner I use it in
almost every single look as well to just
that's the vanilla but I don't care
because I like product so I'm getting
that eyeliner and my hand mirror
and I always start in the middle good
then I work my way out like that and
then I go in
like that and then I like to go to the
outer point of my eye and make it a
basic line like that so now you have a
basic line and now it's time to wing it
out so for this look you want to follow
the angle or if your natural eye where
it goes up so I'm doing that here to O
go up and you can always take q-tips in
make it look better and then from that
point all the way there I'm going to
bring it back in and I'm going to grab
some more product and fill that gap in
so first on we sharpen the middle line
we got and then filled it in
okay so what I am seeing on my eye is
that this one goes away if you turn this
one goes way more up than this one so
I'm going to grab a q-tip and I'm just
going to grab them and remove it so now
you have that line and it's finally in
the angle that we want and now you are
going to make it longer and thicker and
better so I'm just doing everything I
need to do to make this line work
so once that line is dry you can go back
to the shadowing part so we already make
that basic line and now it's time to
make that line look really define and
real and pretty and so I'm going to take
copper plate again and this time we're
going to go above that line and all the
way and when I son to look is that right
here the shadows fill up a bit just a
bit don't over kill it words now I'm
going to take this Sigma 212 brush and
it's a flat a flat brush like that and
I'm going to take embark my Mac and um
we're going to make that crease I'll go
down like that I don't want to like how
it looks like that's over them down so
I'm good embark and we're going down
down into that line
and do this motion like this to go in
I with that embark in the same brush
we're going to UM wing the shadows out
so take your embark and go out and
followed a line and keep it on the same
with your shadow so you're going to do
this and then go into your shadows but
keep it winged and right now it looks
really really harsh are you going to
take a 217 blending brush by Mac and
blend this all out it's making nice soft
and pretty you can take a really big
Lenny brush and blend the edges like
that now I'm going to grab a pencil
brush like this like this is from the
essence of beauty and go back in Embarq
and because you just blend it the colors
are kind of flat and gray so you really
want to intensify those colors again now
going back in vanilla eye to the white
mac and this is our brow bone highlight
and what I like to do with this shadow
right now is to blend those um I shadows
perfectly and now is the time to make it
look gradient to make it look perfect to
make this inner corner not look like
you've been hitting your eye but make it
nice and pretty and the this winged eye
part to make that fade into nothing
basically
so with the vanilla with the brow bone
highlight you really are going to make
the upper part of this look perfect so
for now we have enough of that upper
part we're going to work a little lower
lid on the lower lid is really pretty it
is like this right line that starts here
goes to the war
line and wipes out under just wet under
this liner so we're going to do that too
of course I'm going to wipe that 212
brush off and go in max gesso that is a
matte white and get that on the brush
and I am going to place a white line
under this a winged eyeliner so just go
right under it and fade it out right
like that and then take your finger and
blend it out I know right now looks like
done thank you why-why-why and then
you're going to take a little bit more
of that gesso and put it on your inner
corners right here so right here and I'm
going to take a signed sealed by Mac
which is an almost black plum purple
color I think I already said that but
with a 2-14 my Sigma my favorite brush
should work under on my under lid so I'm
taking signed sealed and this is going
onto your lower lash line like this like
this just go onto your lower lash line
like that and then once you reach that
white point you want to wing that out
too but I'm going to grab another brush
for that which is the stargazer one so
I'm going back inside sealed and then
wing this out falling to white as well
and what idea was wrong I went down you
need to go up with dye they can always
take your finger or brush and blend
the edges like that and you want to do
the same with the inner part but not as
dramatic so I'm taking copper plate for
that which is a lighter color and go a
little bit under that white like this a
little bit like this and you want to
keep in mind that you want to make that
lower lid really really dark because
it's really smoking dark in the video so
go ahead and smoke that down and do your
thing with it and I can always go back
into the white and make that white again
so that's basically it for all the
shadows right now I'm going on line my
waterline with NYX jumbo pencil in milk
white to make the looks to make the
looks even bigger to make the eye look
even bigger and tight line with the
black liner so tight lining is right
there
and then apply some mascara which is
remove London's two-volume max flash
Merrick's volume blush oh and now I'm
going to put on false lashes these are
by Manic Panic
and there are called true love and they
look like that they're kind of big kind
of long kinda pretty
I'm this week and that completes the
look
I'm from now on in every video I am
going to try to tell you guys when my
blush is since a couple of you wanted to
know and I never tell a blush I wear um
in the video Beyonce was really clean
and her
really dramatic and there our lips are
renewed so on my cheeks I applied this
blush ombre in spring shine and the dark
side I used to contour and the light
side for blush but I look really red
right now because I have an allergic
reaction my skin starts breaking out so
heavily and it's really dry right now
but we're just putting out foundation on
it to make this video for my lips um I
first use the Michael Tottenham with
base which is like this if you put this
on your lips it will make them
completely blanked out and her lips were
nude but I didn't want to do the my
usual soft coral from from critique
Catrice khatri's to connects creme the
nude which is a lovely new color which
is lighter than the soft coral so I used
that as a base on my lips and then I
took this Mac Liberty of London
collection lipstick in ever hip and ever
hip is a cream Sheen and it is a curly
well it's a bright coral color I just
hope you guys liked it and I hope you
guys try it out and thank you guys so
much so much for watching and I will
talk to and thank you guys so much for
watching and I will see you guys next
time
