Beyonce's taste magazine editorial a
friend of mine gave me three photos of
the magazine and it was insane I tried
to recreate the hair a bit I know that
she had the frontal part laying down and
in one trying to even have one strand
loose look at this ring um a friend of
mine who dippie Academy with me she was
in the same class this medium eggs rings
now and look at that this is a plate
with a macaron oh yeah oh you want to
call it a doughnut and a cake with
whipped cream on top of it it is the
cutest thing ever
I will put her link to where you can get
it in the infobox below and on my
website is trans account it's Marissa
cakes on Facebook it's absolutely the
best thing ever if you want to know I
have to get this day's magazine cover
Beyonce look then please keep on
watching the debris thing you want to do
is apply a base to your eyelids to
prevent anything that you're putting on
your eyes from creasing and I'm using
the soft ochre Paint Pot from Mac
because that is my favorite so the first
column we're going to use is Samoa still
eyeshadow from Mac so just apply this to
enhance her crease a bit for the fun
part and especially fun for this summer
is she took some blue and she applied it
around her lashes and blended it up so
we're going to do exactly the same I'm
going to use Illamasqua smedium pencil
in debonair for this and I'm just going
to make a line from the inner corner to
the outer corner and from the outer
corner all the way on the bottom to the
inner corner again
I'm gonna blend that pencil out with a
pencil brush this is the Sigma e30 just
blend it to make it softer keep in mind
to keep it really small normally you
will let go into the crease and sup no
it's just an eyeliner blended out so you
don't want it to become a crease color
or something just an eyeliner blended
out I'm going to take AI tuna that I
have in a bin night pellet this is
cosmic blue which is amazing and I'm
first gonna apply that with the same
brush on to the lash line as close as
possible stay for the bottom and then
just sort of make it softer I'm going to
take this illamasqua eyeshadow in Anya
and this is an amazing color and I'm
going to blend it like in that lace but
that I have nothing on and the blend it
part so right there and blend it with
the cosmic blue just to again give it
that soft smoked feeling it's definitely
not a lit color it's really still that
eyeliner that it's smudged but just give
it a nice or blend and always go back
into the causing blue and make that more
vibrant again and just do the same to
the bottom with the Anya all right I'm
gonna take some contrast eyes shadow
from Mac and with the same brush just
kind of softly the word of this video is
softly just softly blend it on the outer
corner is and then make it softly go
away again then on one shot she had the
most amazing like silver widest sheen on
the inner corners um I absolutely loved
it I think they played with some a hour
cream just to give it that like greasy
feeling
but I know that some of you hate that so
we're not going to do that today I went
to answer them a couple of days ago and
I went to backstage and mixed age is
this awesome shop in Amsterdam and they
carried the brand Kryolan and Kryolan
has aqua colors now that we meet it
looks like Sharon we walked up to the
aqua colors and then we both literally
screamed
it's like silver put in the pot or
something it's absolutely amazing and
you need water to activate this but I'm
gonna use some neck fix plus spray and
I'm just gonna take a little bit you
only really need to use just a teeny
tiny bit on that inner corner right
there that is already a bit highlighted
I'm just gonna and she had it going up
so I'm going to take another color that
I have from the Ben Nye palette and it
is called ice and by the way I get Ben
Nye from next stage as well and just put
the same brush I'm gonna go over it and
blend it a little bit more at and
because what I have going on it's a
little bit too strong compared to
Beyonce's picture her photo I'm just
gonna blend it out of it to make it less
there you are going to fall of your
chair this is like copper put in the
popped again look for the waterline I'm
gonna use Brown just to keep it a little
bit more wearable and to make it a
little bit more smoky I'm gonna use
Mac's Teddy ICO and I'm just gonna curl
my lashes with my chip and esque eyelash
curler and some mascara this is the
Maybelline one by one now let me tell
you do not get this because it does do
something one by one to your lashes
which is makes it clumpy as hell calm I
just don't have anything other Elena
now so I'm just gonna use it and then I
will be back for the lips except for the
lips she had two colors on the cover of
the magazine she had this like a
brownish nude color and on some photo
she were a baby bright pink and the
perfect color for that is going to be my
very end baby pink which is number
hundred it's perfect for summer when you
want to go all that with color so yeah
