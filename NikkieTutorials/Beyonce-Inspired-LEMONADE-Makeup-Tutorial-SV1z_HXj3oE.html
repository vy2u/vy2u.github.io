tutorial inspired by Queen B Beyonce's
lemonade and I'm not really doing a look
inspired by Beyonce I'm also doing a
look to inspire you to wear to the
formation tour so let's say you were one
of the lucky few to actually get tickets
to go see Beyonce and you don't know
what to wear to see her yet I hope this
will inspire you to come up with a
lemonade inspired makeup look so I
played with yellow and I wanted to be
super super glam and pretty because to
me beyonce is a glam and beautiful and
pretty so yeah if you want to know how
to get this beyonce lemonade inspired
makeup tutorial then please keep on
watching alright so the first thing
we're gonna do today is hydrate and for
this I'm going to use today the Mario
Badescu skincare facial spray and this
contains a lot of rosewater and lately
I've been on a rosewater kick so I've
been using this to kind of lock in
moisture and hydrates I'm going to do
that before we get in with the
foundation this smells amazing so just
let your skin soak this up and then we
are ready for foundation today for
foundation I'll be using the new
Clinique beyond perfecting foundation
and I've been really really loving this
one lately I'm in the color point-five
breeze and if we're really loving this
one because this one provides full
coverage which you know I'm all about
but yet it feels like nothing and it
looks like a natural matte finish which
is but I wish for in the foundation and
why I also like it is because it comes
with a doe foot applicator which I like
cause you can evenly distribute the
product all over the anyways let's get
you collab so I'm just going to
distribute some onto my face and by some
I mean enough for me
and they're going to blend it in using
my Beauty Blender and you definitely
want to tap the foundation in to get the
most coverage but just look how much it
covers any redness and flaws but still
looks like natural skin yes another
reason why I really like this one is
because it stays on like a dream I wear
this to an event in Dubai and it lasted
for the entire day I didn't have to
touch up it just looked perfect and
flawless all day long and just people
can we shut up to Clinique for actually
having a color light enough for my pasty
Whiteface not a lot of brands have that
option and the point-five breeze color
is amazing it's an exact match all right
I'm loving this finish it's time for
concealer for concealer today I'm gonna
make a mixture with my by by under eye
by it cosmetics in light and this new
product for me this is by Sephora and
it's called the smoothing and
brightening concealer and this is in the
color Claire light one so popping
bye-bye under-eye on first I'm white we
gonna add some social extra light and
again going back in with my Beauty
Blender and once I solve it
and now I'm going to set it use my NARS
powder in the snow all right now with my
morphe M 444 and my Estee Lauder Double
Wear powder and just going to set the
remaining remaining parts of my face and
then usually for my forehead I like
using my e 54 cause it's a little larger
and makes it quicker and for my under
eyes are going to take the morphe 49 and
mix Double Wear powder with in our snow
and apply that under my eyes to blend in
the baked the first thing we're going to
do for eyes is a PI base to keep this
look on all day throughout that entire
concert and I'm going to go for Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot and to apply them using
a sigma 3d HD precision brush from the
morphe 35o all matte palette I'm going
to take the lightest lightest shade and
with a Mac 252 I'm just going to set
everything from my brow bone to crease
with that color to help blending later
on for the crease I'll be taking this
color right here and mixing it with this
one and with my morphe and 5:11 I'm just
going to apply that to the crease softly
now hopping over to the morphe 35o all
shimmer palette and taking the lightest
shimmery shade all the way in the top
left and with my luck C 211 brush I'm
just going to highlight my brow bone
which I never do because I always keep
my brow bone matte but for today I went
for shimmer now going in with this color
right here for the lid and you
named Mac 242 to apply this and going
over top a little with that lighter
shimmery shade and also really
highlighting the inner corners
alright hopping back to the 3500 matte
palette and taking a warmer darker Brown
and with my morphe m 514 i'm just going
to darken that crease a tiny bit more
all right now Stan for the liner I'm
gonna go in with my ardency in punker
rock on liquid liner to create my
outline then from the tip bring it back
to the lash line and then connect the
inner corner to the rest of the wing now
I'm going to fill everything in using
line a slight is Sigma in the color
legend okay now we're going to create a
new inner corner so extended with that
same liquid liner and then I like taking
my Oprah fix line eyeliner gel and black
to really get that inner corner there
all right now let's focus on the yellow
I'm going to go in with my yellow
submarine big slide eyeliner deadly
Oprah and I'm going to place it right
underneath that you in a corner and then
drag it out and that will be the yellow
so with a Smith 212 brush a first laying
on that eyeliner gel and then quickly
right after set it with a yellow
eyeshadow and I'm going to go in with
color pops cream gel liner in punch on
my waterline and don't be afraid to drag
this onto the actual lash line as well
and also setting this with the yellow
eyeshadow and I'm using Mel Cosmetics
neon also drug it out now with a black
liner we're going to trace underneath
the yellow to create an all-new eye
shape leaving the tiniest bit of room in
between and only go in about this far
and then for the outer corner kind of
pull it out straight and then going in
with a warm brown and smudging this out
slightly all right we finally reached
our end destination as far as the eye
department goes it's now time for lashes
I'm going to go in with the glossy
lashes in Abu Dhabi and these are so
amazing and yes so I'm going to play
this right now all right we've come this
far don't give up now it's time to
contour the face I'm gonna contour today
as always using the Kevyn Aucoin and
medium sculpting powder and my favorite
contouring brush the morphe at 5:30
and it's time to snatch those cheeks and
give it to the haters we're also gonna
contour the jaw line cuz mama a fries
yesterday and we gotta act like we
didn't eat fries yesterday and a little
trick I've been doing to make my contour
even sharper but still natural and
concentrated at the same time I've been
taking my zoeva 140 left the teat buffer
brush and just a tiny bit of that
contouring powder and just at the very
base of the contour intensified with
that brush you can see how that's like
you sunken and now very lightly cut it
in Pat it out to blend and see how it
made my contour more intense but not
like oh my god contour where are you
going with that girl it's it's a girl
where you go with a beautiful contour
you know what I'm saying and you can
always go back in with your m4 for for
brush by morphe that still has your face
powder in it and clean up underneath and
can attempt at the edges
to buff it in and work for a bus going
to use a sigma or a powder this is in
the color core DeRosa and it's a very
warm sultry goodness for the cheeks so
I'm going to use my Cosette number two
brush to apply it and just add some life
to those cheeks and then a little trick
I've been doing lately is grabbing the
blush and also applying it softly onto
the chin and I feel like that just adds
a little bit more warmth to the face
whereas if you don't do it it's just
like Oh cheeks oh so much life and there
are some places kind of dead I like
having it this definitely for
highlighter I'm going to use moonstone
by Becca and my favorite morphe
highlighting brush my morphe M 310 a bit
Becky with the good hair where's this is
a highlighter and a little bit on the
tip of the nose to show Beyonce when
you're in the back of the audience that
you're there she will see you a little
bit on the Cupid's bow and if you really
want to go for that below grab the
tiniest bit right here just in the
center of your brows a little bit above
it just the tiniest just a tiny slit and
that will make you look go away
for lips I'm gonna create a fun ombre
I'm gonna go in with the new
Too Faced melted matte liquid lipsticks
these are quickly becoming one of my top
favorites I'm gonna go in first with
Queen B of course and this is going
mainly on the outer corners
and then on the rest of the lip we're
going to use me so pretty like this the
perfect ombre new lip now all we need is
some setting spray and I'm going to go
in with the Urban Decay all nighter an
impure Jeffrey star style soak yourself
