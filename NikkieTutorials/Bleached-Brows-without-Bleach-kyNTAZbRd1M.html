bitches oh yeah way I can definitely
feel that one whose idea was this you're
getting fired I can't even talk loud
without the neighbours thinking going
insane do it oh oh oh you like the eye
shadow oh me too
in love you too okay so today I'm doing
a Blitzer eyebrows without bleach video
then a product I'm using today is this
Kryolan aqua color in ivory and it is a
water activated product we're going to
activate it and I'm going to activate it
with a fixed Bloods by Mac so I'm going
to just put some on there get it wet
then grab a spoolie you know a spoolie
and then cover it a bit with the ivory
the ivory aqua color now put some on
your hand so you don't get too much on
your brows you're going to brush the
hairs of your brows down with this just
brush it down and take a little bit more
of product and brush it up really
carefully and that's it that's a
bleached brow without using bleach and
then what I always do is because I don't
have a lot of brow hairs I like to give
them a little bit more of like
definition so I'm going to take some
concealer from mac and a concealer brush
and I'm just going to make a line
underneath them to make it more defined
and then of course blend it out like
that and that gives so much more
definition to your bleached eyebrows um
so thank you guys so much for watching

the comment section below for a list of
all products used it's on my website
