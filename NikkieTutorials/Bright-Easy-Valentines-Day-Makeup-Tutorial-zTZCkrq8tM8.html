Valentine's Day inspired makeup tutorial
just taking sort of my spin on
Valentine's Day I didn't want to go for
like the the rosy gold and the bronze II
bronzes and new shimmer shahboz I just
wanted to include a pop of color and
today I chose Fort lilac and pink
because Valentine's Day I just do grout
the look a little bit more I added a
winged eyeliner and just my necklace
says yawn so yeah that is what I came up
with for Valentine's Day this year and
if you want to know how to get this look
then please keep on watching so I
already applied my base and for that I
use my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and I'm
gonna take this cream pigment by
Illamasqua called dam and I'm applying
this cream pigment by Illamasqua to my
eyelids just to make the light like you
purple color that I'm gonna put on top
more vivid because I don't own a
physical eye like I said I'm gonna make
one myself we're going to use my sugar
pill poison plum eye shadow and
Illamasqua sex eyes shadow and together
this will make the perfect bright lilac
color and go ahead and pet that on top
of depth cream pigment for the crease
I'm gonna use said their pink eye shadow
by Mac so just go ahead and blend that
into the crease meeting this beautiful
visit lilac color on the lid and then
with an even bigger blending brush sort
of diffuse that out even more I'm
applying that same lilac color to the
outer part of my lower lash line so
right here and then for the remaining
part of the lower lash line I'm going to
take copper plate by Mac and I'm gonna
do that trick of leaving the inner gaps
sort of open to make your eyes look a
little bit more open and intense and
just a little bit bigger so you kind of
want to leave a gap here on the inner
corner to sort of open up your eyes a
bit more and once you have that gap just
follow the rest of the line along the
remaining part of your lower lash line
and to intensify that line a bit more
I'm going to take a dark grey
and make it a little bit deeper and then
take you my light light color again I'm
going to intensify that outer part here
then on that gap that we left open I'm
going to take this a pigment by makeup
studio this is the jewel effects in
shine and then just go ahead and apply
this to the inner corner and that little
gap and blend it out on the waterline it
will be playing my bend i neutralize
your cream crayon in ultra light it's a
new one for me and open up your
waterline with this okay I'm now going
to do is quickly apply a liquid liner or
gel eyeliner a black winged liner and I
kept it very girly and sort of flirty
and young and fresh so you want to keep
the overall part of the liner really
small and thin and then once you get to
the part where you want to place your
wing you want to thicken it a bit so the
entire overall feel of the liner is
really precise and small and thin but
then once you get to the corner and you
make that wing you can make a little bit
more big and thicker
okay I'm just gonna put some mascara on
now this is the makeup studio waterproof
3d extra black and four lashes I will be
using the Mac 35 okay now it's time for
the cheeks and what I'm gonna do is I'm
just gonna keep it natural and a lot of
glow because what is better on
Valentine's Day than just the perfect
glowy skin chocolate yes a life yes that
too but glowy skin also but before we go
to the globe let's go to the contouring
for contouring I used my Illamasqua
eyeshadow in heroine and I'm just gonna
add a little bit more to buff that in
and make my skin look a little bit more
bronze eager and healthier I'm going to
use my illamasqua lush in disobey the
works for blush I'm actually going to
take scissor pink eyeshadow again and
just use that as a blush as well why buy
so many products when you can just just
use like the same products that you're
already used and keep it light don't go
too far with this you will regret it
okay that was actually time for that
glow what I'm going to use is whisper of
guilt extra dimension skin finish by Mac
and then a little bit just a little bit
on top the over shadow sexpot pigment by
the balm called no money no honey
make yourself glowy do that oh god
that's pretty okay and then for the lips
I will just be applying this lipstick by
Mac called pure Zen dozenn

Day inspired makeup tutorial just a a
