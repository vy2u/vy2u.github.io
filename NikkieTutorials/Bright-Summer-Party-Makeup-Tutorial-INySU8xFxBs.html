tutorial on this look right here the
colors of this look are inspired by the
spring/summer runway show of Gucci or
Prada Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana Fendi and ed Ghana
all talk so today I am going to do a
summer party look with some really
bright framed eyes you can't apply some
bright lips with this but I like to just
have every attention to my eyes and then
the looks and then my hand on my clothes
and in my and if you want to know how I
got this look then please keep on
watching
okay so excused a hair I know it's very
very sexy and very very attractive so
the first thing you want to do is apply
a base your eyelids to prevent your
eyeshadow from creasing and the one I'm
using is of course my Mac soft ochre
Paint Pot okay so the first action is
that we'll be using our flame point by
sugarpill and this is red break by
matter with that I'm just starting off
by putting that on my lower lash line
and then going all the way in and I only
use flameboy by sugarpill that outer
part so now I'm just going into red
brick and even a little bit of next rule
I would that I'm gonna continue making
my lower lid orange next time we'll be
taking this vent now I shoulda called
tangerine and I'm blending that at like
the edge of the orange part so you get a
really nice gradient from like bright
orange to like a gold shine color and
take your orange colors again and wing
that out by following the direction of
your waterline for my eyelids that will
be using Mac's Samoa silk and arena
apply that to the eyelid for the purple
I will be using a mixture of sugar pills
poison plum and
power boosted you want to keep in mind
that when you cut your crease you want
to look straight ahead in your mirror
because then you will see if the line is
still visible when you just look normal
like normal in front of you now from
that point that we made from the orange
continue by cutting your crease with the
purple and then I like to wing it out a
bit at the end and then go back in all
the way at the inner corners
another thing a bit of makes a vibrant
grape and with that I'm going to start
off by blending the edges of my cut
purple crease now keep in mind that you
want to keep this eye look small you
don't want to blend it too much you
don't want to blend it up too high you
don't want to you don't want to go too
far with it because it's really all
about that cut crease and then it's like
the showstopper so just lightly blend
the edges of the purple cut crease okay
now going to meet up the orange with the
purple right here that outer corner as a
highlight i will be using mac's
chamomile and i'm using that on their
brow bone for eyeliner and we'll be
using mac's blacktrack fluid line in dip
down and with that I'm just gonna make a
really small winged eyeliner just you
make the lashes blending a little bit
more natural and just to give the lashes
a little bit of like dark roots
or my waterline I will be using my
favorite been night neutralized your
Korean crayon and I wanted to apply some
mascara to my lashes and this is the
makeup studio 3d extra black waterproof
and then for false lashes of course I
will be using Miss adoro
number 747 m okay so for takes as a
contour I will be using NYX blush in
taupe we're washing using this color by
Mac called trace gold and this is a
really nice sort of bronze a shimmery
color so don't apply too much because it
will look like a frost head just to warm
up the face a bit and give it a little
bit more of the glow even as the face
highlight I'm using Mac mineralized
skinfinish in lightscapade and that is
going onto this part right here and then
because I want to look a little bit more
glowy than normal also a bit here above
the brow and down my nose okay so for
lips I I decided to go nude today
because I just applied red lips to it
and I felt like a clown and not like a
fashionable like folk ish clown which is
like a clown like a scary freakin clowns
so I'm going to give you two options
option number one is the nude lip and
for that I should just first pale in out
your lip width or like blending out your
lip with next lip erase and pill or dim
whichever one you are and then on top I
suggest either hue my favorite nude
lipstick or a bit of bidding love I'm
actually going to mix the two together
and apply that right after but if your
unlike a colorful like bandwagon today
then you can always go for like bright
pink lips bright red lips just do
whatever you want to do with the lips
basically and that guys completes this
summer party look with some bright like
praying to eyes I don't know what to
call it I just like to use to work
framed oh oh no friends like oh oh no
stroke stroke around it struck off
stroke is like a strategy and stuff
