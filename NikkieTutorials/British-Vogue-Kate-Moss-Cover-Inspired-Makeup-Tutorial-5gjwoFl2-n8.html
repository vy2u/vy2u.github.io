cover of Kate Moss I absolutely love
this cover the spread as well is amazing
just look at that so today I decided to
try that look out I already did it once
but then my lighting was bad and now I'm
trying a new camera it's like this look
it either goes really good or really bad
so this is the second time doing it and
I so much hope that this camera is
speaking seeing everything good up with
your hair like right now I just have to
put it on focus myself so when I'm like
too close I'm out of the focus minam if
you want to know how this is look then
please keep them watching
so the first thing you want to do is
apply base to your eyelids to prevent
the eyeshadow from creasing and the one
I'm using is the Mac Paint Pot in soft
ochre the first car going to take is mix
cork and we're going to apply that to as
like sort of a winged eyeliner what I'm
gonna do is worse than powder puff right
where is money where's my bottle and I'm
gonna start applying a line underneath
my eye just like that and then I'm gonna
follow that waterline so I'm gonna go
out a bit and then from that point just
like an eyeliner I'm gonna go back onto
the lid and in the crease for a little
bit of definition and right now it looks
really harsh but you're gonna blend that
out later on and I'm gonna blend it out
so it's really soft and
just like a soft shadow of the eye for
just a little bit of definition but you
definitely want that like lift to the
eye just that like a little wing you
want to keep that in there with the big
blending brush and maximo a silk
eyeshadow and just gonna take some on
that brush and I'm just going to softly
apply that to the lid for some warmth
and also put that in the crease if you
like then apply some own soap to the
lower lash line as well
this will add such a lovely like warmth
to the eye and then take some cork again
and we get a little bit darker then take
a big blending brush again and just
blend it all until it's soft and pretty
okay now I'm just gonna curl my lashes
with this japonesque eyelash curler and
apply some waterproof mascara to my top
lashes only and eye mascara I'm using as
a makeup studio water-resistant of
Volume Mascara
I absolutely love that one so I'm gonna
do that to my lashes and demo a little
bit yeah sorry I just forgot to press
record but what I'm doing is the lips
were just a little bit like a deep in
red and for that I'm gonna use Mac's
brick lip pencil and I'm just gonna fill
in my entire mouth of that so just first
align it and then fill it in
so once you've done that I'm gonna go on
top with the lipstick and this is max
red so just take a lip brush and just
put that on top now Elizabeth Arden 8
hour cream is like heaven in the
industry it is perfect for like
conditioning your lips put that like wet
shine on your face it makes when you put
it on an eye it makes your I really like
that wet sweaty feeling so to get that
amazing shine on the lips today I'm
going to use the Elizabeth Arden 8 hour
cream
I think I'm much pretty good so yeah
that completes this cake mods British
Vogue cover inspired look I hope you
enjoyed it for a full list of all
products to use go to my website and
even tutorials comm um I tried out no
neo camera today let me know what you
think this is my like photo camera this
