tutorial on Britney Spears in her new
music video with will.i.am called scream
and shout I absolutely loved the song I
love the tune so today I'm gonna do a
really fun sort of eyeliner eye with
these sort of pop underneath and a lot
of lashes I heard a lot of people say
wow did you get a Botox or a facelift or
what what's wrong is she looks really
different lights people everything in
photography and sort of looking younger
is light and what they did with Britney
was they had this sort of we call it tl
tungsten light sort of like this bar of
light and what they did was sort of move
that around her face up and down
everyone looks different with lights it
doesn't matter because if you put it
right here you kind of look normal but
when you put it above you you look sort
of like an angel and when you put it
below you you look sort of alien-esque
anyways this is how to get her makeup
from the entire music video if you want
to know how to get this then please keep
on watching so it's always the first
thing you want to do is apply a base
your eyelid superfan thigh shadow from
creasing and the one I'm using is my Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot I'm gonna start off
with this middle grey color right here
and this is number s 13 from the moon i
shadow palette in number po2 that's not
it weird but I am weird and the end of
the world today so it's okay okay so I'm
gonna start off by defining the inner
part of my crease because I found a shot
of the music video for scream and shout
and you can see that Britney is sort of
like in this pose right here and you can
see that right here and up until there
there's a lot of definition with a sort
of gray color then continue throughout
the rest of the crease with that taking
a big fluffy blending brush and on the
make it softer and blend it up and out
now I'm going to make the light color
with the dark color from this in palette
and dark
that inner crease up even more and
Brittany's inner crease was super super
defined I'm quickly gonna highlight my
brow bone using Mac's blog type I shadow
for the lid I'm gonna use Mac's
naked pigments and we definitely don't
want to get naked with this tutorial
ashtec no nudes okay for the lower lash
line I'm again going to blend these two
together and then sort of make a really
nice graphic eyeliner with those and the
brush I'm going to use for this is the
Mac 266 but I'm going to use it wet
first just start defining the middle as
close to the lash line as possible
okay then once you get to that inner
corner kind of make a sort of line just
underneath it so you kind of have the
space free between your real sort of
waterline and your lash line so you kind
of have the gap and the same goes for
the other side you kind of want to stay
close to the lash line and then wing it
out it's really hard to explain but you
sort of just have to win it bring it
back in to connect it to your eye okay
now I'm going to take blank type eyes
shadow by Mac again and I'm gonna use
this wet as well and that will kind of
make it sort of like a powdery concealer
which is really nice to make that line
underneath really really precise
and once you've sort of concealed with
that eye shadow you can really see where
you need to lengthen your line and where
you sort of have to connect it so I see
that right here I still have to connect
it a little bit more precise and this
inner part should be a little bit longer
because it's longer on the other side as
well okay play the top eyeliner I'm just
gonna do a really basic winged eyeliner
okay so I went ahead and applied some
benign neutralizing cream crayon in red
concealer number one mp3 to my
waterlines are really open up them eyes
because Britney was wearing like a
really really light nude color on her
waterline to give that Barbie effect now
for mascara I'm gonna use my waterproof
3d extra black mascara by makeup studio
on my top lashes then on my bottom
lashes I'm gonna use two different ones
this is the mascara by makeup studio
called ultimate curl and then to further
really define them I'm gonna use the
Clinique bottom lash line mascara it's a
really really small one ephra lashes I'm
gonna use the mister oh seven four seven
ends okay so it takes up first as always
going to contour with my NYX blush in
taupe this is I would die without this
and I've said that a hundred times now
but I would really it's today it's like
glassy on earth and this is I can't use
enough of this we're all gonna die then
also did your temples and your forehead
a bit now comes the next part that I
always do and contouring warming up my
face with my
Illamasqua blushing disobey we all know
this as well nothing new here for blush
in the muse next Melba and that's a
highlight I'm going to use my NARS
albatross and I want to thank Masha
Beauty gloss because because of her I
bought this and it's absolutely gorgeous
and then also above your brows and your
nose and your Cupid's bow look how gold
and shiny and pretty albatrosses and to
finish it all off I'm gonna use flash
pot lipstick by Mac on my lips and this
is a really nude matte color which I'm
gonna blend out with my fingers and that
guys completes my look for the Britney
Spears scream and shout music video
inspired Recreation tutorial I really
really like this I love the thing
underneath the eyes it kind of gives you
like this Barbie sort of dull
but it's still really wearable and fun
for parties and it's just really Britney
