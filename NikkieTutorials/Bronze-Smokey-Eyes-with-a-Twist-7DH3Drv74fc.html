using Mac pigment and sugarpill I got
some questions lately on how I like to
use my penguins and I did a look
yesterday and I tweet picked it twit
picked it and I got some requests to our
tutorial on it I love to look myself it
was dark out going it's nice for
clubbing so yeah today I'm going to
explain to you how I like to use my
pigments and if you want to know how I
did this and please keep on watching
first thing you want to do is apply a
base to prevent your eyes from creasing
and I use my Michael Todd nude cream
eyeshadow so the first thing we're going
to do is we're going to apply carbon and
Swiss chocolate by Mac onto the lid and
into the crease so I'm just going to
take a 239 by Mac and I'm going to go
into carbon and take some Swiss
chocolate to make it browner and then
apply that to the lid first now I'm
going to take a 226 by Sigma and go into
Swiss chocolate only and we're going to
apply this into the crease
now you're going to darken that crease
up with the carbon
so just take carbons of black color and
go into the crease as well now I like to
take my 239 and go into carbon only and
just um darken the lit up a little bit
more this will really make the pigments
stand out now for the brow bone
highlight I'm going to grab this a MEK
trio i shadow this is love to love now
for the lower lid I'm going to grab
carbon and Swiss chocolate again and
smoke it right here then I like to take
a stiff brush and I'm gonna go into
Swiss chocolate only and apply this all
the way to the inner corner so now it's
time for the fun stuff um we're going to
use the pigments wet
I love Mac pigments I'll have any
payments I love sugar pale I love Lime
Crime I love pigments but I especially
love is this a Mac um mixing medium
eyeliner and what this is is a mixing
medium so you mix it with your pigment
or any loose eyeshadow see more bronzer
I don't know what and if you mix it with
this it will make it waterproof which is
amazing so I love this I never wore
pigments on my lower lid actually
because it run down and I really don't
like it when you have like penguins and
have like though but with this it just
stays on it doesn't go anywhere and it
keeps looking vibrant through the entire
day so if I could recommend one thing
from neck Pro it will be the mixing
medium eyeliner this is great for
glitter as well it just sticks there
doesn't go anywhere and this
beautiful so the first pigment we're
going to use is by Mac and this is
called chocolate brown I'm going to show
you
chocolate brown an amazing color and
because the lid is so like dark I always
love it to put something in the middle
of your lid to make it pop and I don't
know it looks wet and I don't of it so
we're going to apply chocolate brown
penguin to the middle of our lids I'm
gonna grab some mixing medium and put
that on the back of my hand and take a
brush like this and grab just a little
bit of the pigment just a little teeny
bit you don't need a lot and then the
brush is wet with the mixing medium and
then just go into the pigment go in grab
the lid that comes with it push it
against the lid to get it into the brush
and then just um where your pupil is
your iris I don't know your eye put it
right there go up into the crease and
then my gift fade out really pretty now
for the lower lip we're going to use
three pigments I'm going to use
chocolate brown again in the middle
we're going to use gold deluxe by
sugarpill an amazing gold color
and then on the inner corners we're
going to use gold mode by Mac so first
I'm going to grab some mixing medium
onto the brush and go into a chocolate
brown pigment make it kind of even with
what you have on top
now I'm just going to apply some
eyeliner to my waterline I'm going to
use a neck black fluid line some mascara
volume million lashes bottle rial and um
then I will show you deluxe on my list
it are just too pretty rarity products I
just used my Mac peach starka lipstick
it's one of my fave and then on top one
of my new favorite lip glosses this is
my axe sweet hard I hope you enjoyed
this video
umm I know normally I do sell it so I
saw some of those um yeah so thank you
guys so much for watching and I will see
you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
