do something glam glittery grungy
differently I was inspired by Jaden do
your fears of the latest episode of
RuPaul's Drag Race so this is what I
came up with I think this is so much fun
for like a a grungy party or for like a
a a Goffe glam party or just for when
you want to look glam but dark and
different and I I'm really enjoying this
look see how would not any further ado
if you want to know how to get this
glittery grungy glammy look right here
then please stay tuned alright the first
thing as always is priming and putting a
base on the eyelids to prevent
everything from creasing to prevent your
eyeshadow from doing exactly this what
you're seeing right now so for this I'm
taking my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and
this is going from lashes to brow bone
the first color in my crease will be an
eyeshadow by Anastasia Beverly Hills and
this is fawn I'm just picking up a
little bit of it and going directly on
the outer part of my crease right here
so really softly push that in to your
crease and start blending and diffusing
out I'm personally going for a very
rounded eyes shape today so just follow
the curves of your crease the next
eyeshadow is also by Anastasia Beverly
Hills and this is called stoned and with
this I'm just going to blow out that
crease color a tiny bit more so just
with windshield wiper motions and a
fluffy blending brush just diffuse and
soften the edges then to really deepen
the outer part of the crease and taking
rich brown eyeshadow by Anasazi Berkeley
Hills
and you want to start up so little and
with the tiniest amount of product
possible to prevent any fallout from
happening plus you make the blend really
seamless and nice so just with a tiny
amount of product start deepening those
outer corners for the lower lash line
I'm again going in fawn and with this
you're really going to map out which
look you want to give your under-eye
area so I tried to go for this like
super smoky intense lower lash line we
can keep it small and concentrated also
but I'm going for blended and smoky
so with fawn really determined that
shape they using rich Brown I'm really
adding a lot of drama for the lid I'll
be using this grimace polly glitter in
number 75 and a tiniest bit of max
glitter in gold and I'll just Fanning it
with a piece of paper to prevent it from
creasing for just a fun twist I'm again
extending the inner corners just very
nice the ducted feel all you want to do
now is apply some falsies and the eyes
are done so for falsies today I'll be
using iconic by house of lashes and as
you can see once you put the lashes on
it creates a little tiny gap here you
want to fill that in with a little bit
of black eyeshadow and to seal the deal
some mascara on the lower lashes
four cheeks I want to sculpt my face
because I need a little bit of sculpting
so I'll be using illamasqua eyeshadow in
heroine then to bronze I'm taking this
huge bronzer by L'Oreal this is the glam
bronze in number one I'm just warming up
my complexion with this because the lips
are going to be so drastically dramatic
I just want my entire complexion to go
he's put that far blush and there isn't
a day I could go without luminoso by
Milani anime take this new Mac brush
this is the 137 I got it because it
looked funny and I like funny things so
let's see how it works with blush it's
really diffusive really blows out color
I don't know what do you guys use this
brush for to highlight and give myself a
luminous glow moonstone by Becca
it needs more glow so I'm going in with
Becca's shimmering skin perfecter
pressed in rose gold and again that
weird neck brush just a tiny bit then
I'm just going to glow all over my
cheeks
it's a glow party and as if for the
cheeks
her lips we're going for black and
glitter so I'm going to take this
Anasazi Beverly Hills cream waterproof
cream color and this is the color jet
and I'm just going to use this as a
lipstick
overtop for some reflection I'm taking
this color pop super shock shadow in
what's this called ratchet and I'm
applying this with a finger just to get
some of that glitter going ever actual
glitter I'll be using lit cosmetics
glitter in size number three and this is
called black in black
this glitter is so fun it just
transforms the slip into like a
glistening diamond black just a black
diamond I I'm in love oh my god
