is day number one of winter wonder week
and what is went one a week you asked me
in winter wonder week I upload a video
one video every day for seven days and
we call it winter one a week and today
is day number one baby I am so excited
to share all the glam with you this week
and I cannot wait for you to join me so
today is day number one and today I did
a makeup tutorial on this classic
holiday glam cut crease makeup look with
a modern twist in the glitter lips I've
been really wanting to do glitter lives
for the longest time now and today I
finally could say it without any further
ado if you'd like to know how to get
this makeup look right here then please
keep on watching
all righty so please excuse the dark
circles I literally just landed from New
York City and now I'm back here at home
filming the first winter one a week
video for you right now mama has been
traveling and my dark circles are giving
it away so the first thing I'm gonna go
in with is my veil and it's a primer and
this one right here is called the sunset
light primer serum and I'm still testing
this out it's been about a week of me
trying this out but the people at El
Cajon which is one of my all-time
favorite stores in New York City for
makeup shopping they told me that this
is one of the best primers out there
because it literally keeps your makeup
on the entire day so I'm just gonna
focus this on my t-zone and where I
really need it to stick even though it's
1:00 in the morning and I'm not going
anywhere but I want it to stick do you
see how it almost blurred my skin I
haven't seen it working on camera yet
but seeing it now doing its thing okay
surprise good drunk I'm gonna go in with
my favorite mac prolongwear it
nourishing a waterproof a foundation and
the color NC 15
this is probably my Holy Grail
foundation at the moment it is
everything it stays with me all day
it's a beautiful full coverage but it
feels really light and thin and it just
doesn't feel like you're wearing a ton
of makeup on your face and I'm applying
this using my Beauty Blender
for concealer today I'm gonna go in with
the one concealer but I know never
leaves me in the rain I'm gonna go with
the concealer that I know never lets me
down
heart-shaped tape and it's now back in
stock the world has been waiting for
them to get back in stock and they
finally are right now and I'm gonna go
in with the color fair and I am going a
little lighter with my foundation color
today because I really want that classic
porcelain doll finish on my face
and now I'm gonna bake my under-eye area
to prevent it all from creasing
and I know I look like a hideous mess
right now but once we add bronzer
contour blush highlight it's all gonna
pull together and make the under eye
look super lifted and amazing so now I
want to set the rest of my face and he's
this powder right here by Estee Lauder
it's called the double wear powder and
I'm gonna be using this beautiful brush
right here
it's the morphe y6 I think a lot of
people when they see this brush they
think all foundation but I just want to
show you that because it has a flat top
and because it is a dense kabuki brush
it is amazing to do powder with because
it really gets a powder on the skin
busted into the skin and locks your
makeup on for the rest of the day and
not to brush away my baked I'm going to
go into my Sigma f80 9 my favorite brush
to get the baked away with and the same
powder to tone down that color a little
bit to not make it as crazy as it is
right now and then we are set and ready
for brows
to make sure these eyes don't go
anywhere this holiday season I'm priming
using my soft ochre Paint Pot by Max for
the crease at first going into the Kylie
Jenner Holiday Collection eyeshadow
palette and taking this color right here
called chestnut and I'm focusing this
into the crease and blowing and smoking
it out and then once you reach the outer
corners you kind of want to swoop it out
now you slightly want to darken that
using silent night
and I'm going to cut the lid using this
donessa my ryx color fix in the color
lift and please take your time doing
this and get it as cut as you can I'm
gonna be setting the white using this
Cosette I shadow in Zen and let me tell
you doing this cut crease will not make
you then but trust me once it's on you
will feel Zen
and now with a precise a liner brush and
silent night I'm really going to define
the edge of where the colors meet now
it's time for a luscious defined winged
liner
for the lower lashline and going back
into silent night and on the outer third
of my lower lashline I'm stamping on
this color for definition and from their
continuing using chestnut and finishing
on the inner corners using Cosette Zen
again to finish off this beautiful cut
crease all I need is some false lashes
these are by Lena lashes called Noemi
all right now that we are cut and
creased it's time to focus on the face
I'm going to grab my red I'll compact de
luxe contouring powder in number three
and this little brushy right here and
I'm going to cut my cheekbone
okay nuts it clean up I'm going to grab
the RCM a no color setting powder and
one of these triangle sponges like these
I'm going to pick up the powder
and clean up underneath where you placed
your contour now for blush I'm gonna go
into max a Spellbinder which is perfect
with this entire look in the sweater and
a SM fully aware that it look like a
cheap as santa claus right now with the
beard yeah
and tis the season to blind people's
eyes out with your glow I'm going to go
in with my current favorite I've been
really really obsessed with this one
this one is a Mac extra dimension skin
finish in the color double gleam people
this is where it's at
I've had it for about a week and a half
now and I haven't been able to put it
down it is everything I mean unreal just
oh quickly gonna contour and highlight
my nose and brush away the baked in
three two one and of course we need a
setting spray to lock this all into
place and to prevent us from looking too
cakey so we wanted to transform us into
a dewy goddess and he used NYX dewy
finish makeup setting spray like I said
I want this to be a super beautiful
classic holiday glam makeup look but
with a twist so first gotta go in with a
lipstick by Pat McGrath and this is her
lipstick venom number one which is an
outrageously beautiful red so that's
what I'm gonna use oh my god okay the
pigment and ease of using this is insane
like honestly I think this is one of the
most pigmented lipsticks I've ever
worked with
and of course you can leave it like this
and keep it super classy and elegant and
sexy but like I said I want a modern
twist so I'm gonna go in with glitter
this one is also by Pat McGrath this is
the venom micro-fine glitter and I'm
going to put a little bit of eyelash
glue adhesive on my lips to really make
this stick and last all night long no
matter what you're doing and then we
have a long lasting glittery red lip
which is alright so for some duo
off you guys isn't this unreal oh love
it and that guys includes this classic
holiday glam makeup tutorial with a
modern twist I hope you guys enjoyed for
