Day look on Sunday I thought it would
only be fitting to also do a tutorial
for all you love books out there that do
love Valentine's Day today I'll be
showing you how to do this classic matte
romantic Valentine's date night makeup
look it is just such a classic and
stable look that will fit every face out
there now I do have some more
Valentine's Day that's coming up for you
but today I wanted to keep it simple and
sophisticated so that mean further adieu
if you would like to know how to get
this right here then keep on watching
all right so let's get romantic and
class classy so the first product I'm
going to go in with is by elf
this right here is coffee prep and
hydrate bomb and I'm feeling a little
bit dry so gosh so I'm going to use this
tool if my skin up now i firstly never
tried this so oh it smells really nice
it applies kind of wet but I definitely
feel hydration from it already so I'm
just going to distribute it all around
my face and then work it in with my
fingers my gosh so it's definitely a
sticker consistency but this feels
amazing it has a select tackiness to it
which i love that for me makes it feel
as if the foundation is a really going
to stick on to it so so far I'm really
impressed I can imagine when you are
oily that this might be a little bit too
much but I'm dry so I love this now
before I go in with any foundation or
concealer I need to prep my under eyes
using be pure identity love this stuff
it makes my under eyes happy for
foundation today I'm going to make a
mixture I am trying out two new
foundations for me the L'Oreal
infallible Pro glow and the L'Oreal
infallible total cover
I want the glow eNOS at the pro glow but
the coverage of the total cover so I
think a mixture of these two will be
perfect
never tried these so let's pray all
right so let's see how this perform I am
liking this it has a beautiful beautiful
coverage like it will totally cover
everything in anything but it still has
a nice luminosity to it which I know I
love my glow I think the color is a
pretty nice match like in this now the
only problem I usually run into with
drugstore foundations is that they
really really Oxford eyes on me I'm
hoping this will stay the color as it is
right now and I do want to remind you
that coverage is such a personal thing
if you love a sheer coverage by all
means go for that for this romantic
Valentine's date night look but if
you're like me and you like to have more
coverage and buy more I mean a lot there
is absolutely no judging in that you
know where the coverage that you like
forget the alarum go in with this beca
one called aqua luminous perfecting
concealer and this is the color
porcelain okay so that is too dark for
me so we're going to light it up with a
different concealer after all right so
shade tape to lighten up the day
now one of the most important things to
do when wearing this to a date or a
night out is to prime your eyelids
we don't Prem your eyelids your
eyeshadows going to crease it's going to
form a line and all your hard work was
for nothing so priming is essential I'm
using Mac soft ochre Paint Pot a
favorite for life now I do want to put
out there that this eye look is going to
be so easy you're going to laugh at this
portion first we're going to go into
this elf eyeshadow palette called mad
format 2 and taking this color right
here to go on the outer corner and
crease you want to start by applying
definition into your crease using short
circular motions a little by little
start building that crease up and
remember for a perfect blend keep using
circular motion picking up a little bit
more and placing it on this outer corner
here this will give you a nice soft
smokey effect to make you look more
flirty once you got that outer corner
and creased down you take whatever is
left in the brush and swoop it towards
the inner portion of your crease this
will remain it from getting too harsh
because there's barely any product list
so this will give you the definition
that you need and don't forget circular
motion so once you have the general
shape go back in with your brush and
really softly start diffusing the edges
this will give you a perfect soft and
flattering blend for the lid and going
into this color right here and just
covering the lid from left to right and
up and down
now picking that crease color up on a
pencil brush and smoking out the lower
lashline softly for a finishing touch
I'm highlighting my inner corner using a
light matte shade and popping some white
eye Kohl on the waterline for lashes
I'll be using these very soft and
natural ones called Gaia by certify
all right just like the eyes we want to
keep the cheeks a little bit more on the
soft side now I love my contouring so
I'm still going to contour and make my
cheeks pop but if you're not a
contouring person by all means skip it
today I'll be using this blush right
here by Mac called taupe I believe
actually a shaping powder and I'm going
to be contouring using my favorite
contouring brush and I like this powder
especially because it contours like it
has enough grayness to contour but it
also has enough warmth to kind of bronze
me up a little bit so for me it's like
the perfect in-between contour and
bronze color for blush I definitely want
to pop up cheek I'm gonna go in with
this makeup forever sculpting blush in
number 10 so living up those cheeks a
little and for a highlighter today I'm
going to go in with the elf moon like
pearls highlighter I am so excited to be
trying this out because this is so
affordable so this is like amazing like
blessed my life okay hope it's for best
okay so it's definitely a softer like
glow from within look which for this
look because it is more classic and
worth subdued and sophisticated I
actually really don't mind that I think
this highlighter goes perfectly with
this one it has the tendency to look a
little bit lining but it's not so it's
like a sophisticated from within glow
which is perfect for this look for my
nose however I do want something a
little tiny bit more intense now again
this is personal preference I know a lot
of people that don't like to highlight
their nose I love it all right I think
we got to give this skin a little spritz
of setting spray to melt everything
together and to make it seamless and
flawless and today I'm going to go in
with the Milani make it last free smells
so good for lips I want to go for a
classic when you think of Valentine's
Day you think of red classic powerful
lips now of course this is going to make
kissing your date a little bit harder
unless you use a liquid lipstick that
isn't going to budge I'm go in with the
Oprah liquid lipstick in the colour
Milan this is part of a limited edition
set it is so beautiful it's like the
perfect deeper classic red it's a
must-have
mmm the color is perfect like a
statement beautiful red and that guy's
