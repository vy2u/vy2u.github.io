back if you're thinking wow Nikki that's
a lot of makeup on your face prepare for
more because I'm not done yet
today we're gonna be looking at a
color-changing heat activated
highlighter yes I that was what you just
heard all of that was true
let me explain myself a little bit more
so pop Lux came out with a brand new
highlighter called
black ice are you thinking girl that's
gray nobody on planet earth once gray
highlighter on their face but this
highlighter is not what it seems because
potlucks claims that this is a
color-changing powdered skin gloss when
cold this wintry gray toned highlighter
looks as menacing as a blustery sky when
applied to the skin this product
transforms into a gloss as bright as
snow now that is some English I can get
behind well you heard what they said
this is a heat activated color-changing
powdered skin gloss which in my book is
a creamy highlighter so today we're
going to be putting this to the test
we're gonna see if it actually is color
changing we're gonna see how it looks
like on the face I'm gonna see how it
reacts through the skin so let me go
ahead and zoom you guys in a little bit
more and let's see how this turns out
okay guys so I've got the highlight
right here looking great as ever and
let's see what the website says on how
we should apply this all right so here
it says let this heat activated
color-changing highlighter make your
glow as blinding as the Sun hitting ice
for a virtually Universal glow apply
this product on high points over
foundation or prime skin with your
finger and lightly blend for a lighter
skin tones with me hello this is me or
those wanting a bright silvery shine
with pink undertones applied this
product gently with a brush for our best
results start minimally and build up all
right so I'm fairly easy we can do this
I just want to know if if if it actually
check wait wait wait I feel like she'd
Dawson finding out about ghosts wait and
now it's gone oh my god hold on
heat warmth warmth warmth of the body on
the highlighter and I'm removing do you
see what to disappear watch this and it
is almost gone alright so I always order
to when doing a weird product like this
you I want to see the actual I'm gonna
mmm-hmm I really want to see the
difference when you cute one up and do
you let one as it is so we're gonna heat
this one up right here and we're doing
this okay doing this in three two one
what I'm shocked to death I cannot
believe my eyes okay I am ready for this
okay so it's set that for those with a
lighter skin tone you should apply with
a brush so the brush I'm using right now
is the Ray Morris number two brush my
favorite highlighting brush and I'm just
gonna dip my brush into the highlighter
and my fear is that this will look great
because right now it is gray I just
realized that I can make so many fifty
shades of gray jokes in this video oh
yeah well this looks straight up like
dust from a funky little corner hey
mister greatest kinky room let's see I'm
scared okay okay I'm brushing it in wait
how does that work how can you not be
green right now how is that grey is that
a little bit great buying more that is
not looking good what how did they do
this
okay grabbing more as you can see watch
it change watch it change it becomes
darker and darker and darker okay and
applying and it's like watch is this so
it's giving me a very soft and luminous
sheen it's almost as if the skin is
looking wet my biggest fear is that this
will turn gray when I'm cold let's say
I'm walking my dogs and it's very cold
outside because it's winter in Holland
right now let's say it's really cold
outside and I'm wearing this will my
cheeks turn gray
okay trying that again picking it up and
when it's on the brush you can visibly
see it become darker alright and
applying it to the skin yeah it just
looks like a beautiful sort of like face
gloss this is one of those products that
looks stunning for like strobing I see a
beautiful sheen I see a beautiful glow
but my face needs a little bit more
bronzing before we go on with the hi
fighting song in a Bronx real quick I
probably should have done all my other
cheek stuff before doing the
highlighting but you know I couldn't
help myself I had to go there like no
foreplay we had to go right in ha since
I'm in such a pink mood today as you can
tell the news you eight blushes are so
good this is the Coquette blush duo and
seduced me and tease me and tease me is
going on my cheeks which is the lighter
of the two stuff
I love blush like you can try and take
blush away from me it won't happen I
will find it again like you can take it
from me and hide it from me you will try
I will find you okay so now that the
rest of the face is spruced up a little
bit more we can actually go back into
the highlighting and play a little bit
more so this is definitely not enough
highlighting for me so I'm going to dip
back in and apply more and see how far
we can push it this looks so wrong with
so many levels like white does it look
grey here and that you apply it and
ba-bam
there is a glow like this is magic this
is straight-up magic I don't know what's
going on did they close the deal with
the devil like like how a house is
possible tip of nose literally to get
that luminous dewy glow going I swear to
God if I turn gray when it's cold I will
look like The Tin Man
so that is what my face looks like after
highlighting using black eyes by pop lux
when looking at the consistency I know
they say it's a powdered skin gloss to
me it's a straight-up powder like I do
not like it is powdery to me
it applies like a powder it doesn't play
like a cream at all and also when I
touch it it doesn't feel like a cream it
actually feels like a straight-up powder
so I don't know why they would call this
skin gloss maybe they're calling it a
skin gloss because when you look at the
skin it looks like you have glossy
luminous sort of editorial beautiful
skin the highlighter isn't necessarily
really powerful and blind
but it definitely gives you that
beautiful radiance and like that oh
hello she is confident and glowing and
she will get the job you know what I
mean it's not overly correct I like this
type of highlighter it's not overly
crazy it's not too minimal it's that
beautiful in between it makes you look
nice and healthy I just don't want to
turn gray you know what let's try
something be right back okay I'm back
when I say I want to test this I really
want to test this okay so this product
is heat activated by your warmth of the
body warmth oh but what if what if
you're cold do you turn gray let's find
out this one here is ice cream and it is
cold I just took it out of the freezer
and I want to see that if I put this
against my skin this is cold
will it turn gray let's find out you
know one in two okay so the cold surface
is definitely against my skin let's see
no not gray this part feels colder okay
let me try this part it feels a little
bit colder coldness oh my god walking
outside with the dogs it's so cold
outside am i turning gray no I'm not
this is mad let me put this back I
actually want to eat this later I'm
shocked I saw this online and I thought
this is a gimmick this is not gonna work
and I just tried it on and it's it still
is good I'm amazed
so this retails for $23 that's a good
price $23 $23 for a gram of product
which is point wente 8 ounces and at the
highlighters cruelty-free vegan talc
free gluten and paraben free it wasn't
like I was gonna eat it but you never
know I think that's it whoa
and this is what my skin looks like from
afar with the highlighter on and just
whoa
I thought the makeup industry really did
their all on all the highlighters on the
market so far I thought we had seen it
all but pop looks is not playing around
I don't know what they did or how they
did this like I said deal with the devil
but this is true makeup magic the fact
that brands can do this with products is
amazing I mean we in 2018 but Publix
over 20 43 if you ask me this is $23 of
Hello makeup magic what is going on in
the world

think if you're in for a little bit of
fun and if you're in for this type of
highlighter why not go ahead and try it
