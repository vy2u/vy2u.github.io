tutorial or a review or haul or today
I'm actually giving a contest I've been
wanting to do my contest for so long
again because my last one was like over
a year ago and I never really did it
because it's it's kind of a lot of work
the reason I'm doing this contest is
because I hit 60,000 subscribers which
is like mentally a heart stroke to my
brain and the second is because it's
2011 oh and all the haters are gonna
sing the theme of this contest is going
to be winter and New Year's makeup so
with winter think of like I see colors
like winter and New Year's like glitter
and some of that in just New Year's
posting this conscious with two other
amazing gurus on YouTube both of them
I've been a fan of for a really long
time and one of them is actually making
a tattoo for me that I'm getting on my
17th birthday is clair de lys art and
I'm sure a lot of you know her she is
amazing just the most creative videos
ever on YouTube love her accent is
english and or do you call that britain
britain and i can't really explain
myself but um yeah I really like how
she's talking Nvidia fit videos
something in the second is Jen from head
to toe and um from head to toe Jen is an
amazing girl as well she's a really um
brain killer educated
get probably not I still love you though
she has amazing informative videos and
show me my favorite video of hers is how
you should make your bras fit
appropriately so now it's actually time
to tell you guys the rules Claire had
made an amazing blog post with all the
rules in it I can't be really easy now
and tell you guys to just go and visit
that blog post for all the rules I'm
gonna be nice and tell you the rules as
well number one you must be subscribed
to me Claire dailies art and from head
to toe
Jen there will be three categories with
this contest we have dramatic makeup
wearable makeup and a comment winner so
with the theme of New Year's and winter
makeup think of extreme dramatic makeup
like put a snowflake on your face or
something and with simple wearable just
what you can wear outside to work to
school to anywhere and with the comment
I want you to tell your favorite song of
2010 yes let's do that
the title of the makeup video must say
new year's winter makeup conscious entry
and you have to say which section you're
in so let's say you're going for
dramatic your title of the video must be
new year's winter makeup contest entry
dramatic the contest will start at the
2nd of January and it will end on the
1st of February the contest is
completely international the video must
be posted as a video response to either
meet Jen or Claire and that means that
you can enter 3 times so you can do 3
videos well for me one for him one for
Claire and you can do three common
entries as well so one on my video on
Jenn's video and one my Claire's video
the video must not be longer than 3
minutes because you don't have to show
us the tutorial we just want to see the
end result and you can talk about it
also in this video you must say which
section you're answering when traumatic
are simple your video has to be brand
new and it can be an older video to
another contest and just a minute 2
hours no we want new new fresh videos me
Jen and Claire are going to pick our own
winners so that means that there are 12
winners so Jen has three winners Claire
has the three winners and I have three
winners so in whichever girl you're
entering to like if you let's say if
you're going to enter a video - Jen
you're going to watch Jin's announcement
video to see if you won because we the
three of us we have different winners
because we're going to pick out of our
own video responses so if you're going
to make a video make sure that you tell
on who you're entering like I'm entering
for Nikki I'm entering for Jen for
Claire you know so they're going to be
12 different winners so I'm gonna pick 3
Jen kind of pick 3 and Claire it's gonna
be 3 and it was 3 I mean 2 video winners
and one comment winner you have another
little surprise the three of us are all
going to go to each other's video
responses and let's say I really like
this kind of like this entry and but
it's submitted to Jen but I really love
it and that's why we have a fourth prize
the fourth prize is going to be a bonus
prize so we have the two video winners
the comma winner and a bonus winner but
the bonus winner is going to be from Jen
or Clare for me where I'm gonna pick
someone who
in love with and she's going to get a
price from me too or he so again you can
only enter once but we have three girls
so you can make three videos and post
them to three different girls so you can
only enter once at the same girl
it's that clear you can do the makeup on
somebody else to be 16 years or older if
you're younger than 16 years then we
just won a permission from your parents
that we're going to send stuff not
they're not that your parents all like
coming home and your check their mail
and they're like but my daughter has a
but what what is this bum bum it's a bum
honey bum again the link of Claire's
blog post with all the rules is in the
bottom bar it's under this video
