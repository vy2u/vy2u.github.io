video on how to completely take your
contouring to the next level
you know so many contouring trends
lately have graced our faces and quickly
ran away from us again and I must say I
think the place where it all happens
is Instagram I mean let's be honest
girls on Instagram deserve an award for
being the most innovative
bitches on this planet they came up with
clown contouring they came up with
contouring using tape they came up with
so many amazing techniques that I feel
like every every everyday woman should
just wear in her life when doing grocery
shopping and just look her natural best
self I just feel like there's this big
need for contouring to get even better
so a couple weeks ago I scroll down on
Instagram and I saw a lovely girl using
a spoon to contour mm-hmm a spoon yeah
not even getting you and I figured
that's so brilliant why not show all
these people in the world how to contour
using stuff you already have in your
house Plus make it look as natural as
possible
Itachi I got you we're gonna do it so
sit back relax and let's go so I grab my
gear I'm ready to go and we're gonna
start off with this spoon because of
course in 2.2 seconds every hot bitch in
Instagram is gonna use a spoon to
contour with so I'm gonna I'm gonna be
one of them and when contouring using
this technique you want to make sure
that you use a most natural shade as
possible I think this will fit me pretty
nicely so basically I want to do is get
a brush load it up with a beautiful
matching skin tone contour color get
that spoon you want to place it on the
highest point of your cheekbones get
that brush and right next to it create a
very soft but defined line drag the
spoon a little bit more forward to
create a longer line I just flick that
brush that is exactly what you want
mm-hmm also a lot of girls love to
create designs and patterns with their
contours that I was like why not use a
fork because we used a spoon why not use
a fork and I just want to ever so
lightly place it fork on my forehead and
use the pattern to get glam a see how
beautifully fades into the forehead
that's what you want yes bitch Oh
sometimes he can get a little bit
distracted by the beautifulness on your
face and you need that preciseness again
so I'm just gonna take this whisk right
here and now stick my brush through come
on don't resist you know like that and
this will perfectly balance your brush
two-nil your contour your chin contour
has never been so precise that is
exactly what I'm on it it may have went
a little bit onto my highlighting
portions but that's fine that's fine
again we can know this okay now what I
think is key is to create cool patterns
and figures onto your face to really
help take your Beauty to the next level
for blush you're gonna create some
amazing dots using this tool right here
which I never use cuz I don't cook oh
yes bitch and I know this technique can
look a little bit intimidating because
it's so professional you just keep on
going everyone can do this of course you
have to highlight the face as well
because no contour looks good without
its best buddy highlighting and to get
the most coverage out of your product I
suggest using the sponge right here and
just you know go to town and dab it on
stiva completely say if that knows of
course how could I forget it's
Valentine's Day you want this to be a
heart you'll really see it in the end
kind of do you draw heart I hate
valentines day
now because the products are still soft
and so easy to blend in I thought why
not do a quick workaround and use this
right here just to blend it in super
super nicely and to look blended like a
pro you know sometimes with blending
everything out things can get a little
bit rough but you know what that's
nothing facetune can't fix all you want
to do now to finish this all off is add
of course a little bit of highlighter
and you just wanna grow yourself with an
on fleek highlight ding ding don't
forget to highlight the tip of your nose
uh-huh and there you have it the perfect
natural finished contour for everyday
wear to a baby shower to really show the
baby who's boss to go grocery shopping
in a very very religious town it's just
a matter where you want to wear this
dude this looks flaky this looks on
fleek this is on point and you will get
the most likes on Instagram this way
because people just know that you're a
pro at contouring now I'm just so glad I
could help you take your contouring to
the next level to let these Instagram
bitches know you're the boss so yeah
thank you so much for watching and let's
get contouring
hey guys so today I'm doing a tutorial
of course on Lady Gaga at the 50th a
Super Bowl when she's sang the national
anthem when that camera flew by and I
saw a spark of red which was her suit I
already felt like that was the greatest
moment of my life when I saw that spark
of red I went yes Queen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
