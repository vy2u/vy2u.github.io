gonna try one of the latest Instagram
trends today I'm actually going to take
one of those trends and try it out and
see if it actually works I'm not gonna
lie the first time I saw this trend it
was like why why would you do that
what why today we'll be trying the
newest trend contouring your nose using
a fork I'm actually I'm dead on sir you
know I'm actually gonna try this like
seriously I'm just I'm gonna try it and
I'm gonna try and nail it I'm gonna try
and leave the studio with the snatch
nose with a lot of the Instagram trends
I'm like okay but you can you can
actually skip that you actually don't
need that in your life but with the fork
to me it actually does make a lot of
sense contouring your nose can be one of
the most tricky things to do in a makeup
routine because you can go lopsided it
is hard to get the lines even it is hard
to just know your placement so this for
technique actually makes a lot of sense
so without any further ado I'm going to
bust out the fork and contour my toes so
I got my fork right here and what all
these girls do is you actually need
three hands for this I always hold a
mirror in my other hand so how am I
gonna okay so what you want to do is
grab your fork and it has one two three
open spaces and in the center open space
that is where you want your highlight to
be in the in the open spaces right next
to it is where you want your contour to
be this is not one of those moments
where I feel like the smartest of my
bloodline
will do so I'm gonna place the center
opening of the fork on the center of my
nose
I guess it's actually nerve wrecking and
then with this grab your contour powder
I don't even know what I'm doing right
now
so I'm going to take my contour shade
and mmm
okay contour goes into this opening
right here okay okay oh my god so that
is actually really greatly defined where
you need the contour lines to be there's
a little scared that the fork the
openings would be too wide and if you
place the lines of your nose contour too
far from each other you're actually
fighting against your own battle the
closer you place the contour lines to
each other the smaller your nose is
going to look so I was the old a little
tiny bit scared that the fork would be
too far apart so that it would actually
make it bigger but this is actually like
oh ah as a guide awesome okay placing
that fork again and taking my
highlighter shade this is going on the
center well there she is
so that applies a very thin layer of
highlight which is not worth it at all
so now I'm going to go into my favorite
nose contouring brush by morphe the e47
and by the way I'm using the panel on
medium sculpting powder for this and
what I'm going to do is from the contour
lines I'm going to place a brush on top
of it and start blending it out because
it's a tiny bit harsh right now on that
line start buffing it in and out I swear
the gada this works Instagram you are my
false
that is look that is looking very
snatched and then with your face powder
brush and a tiny bit of your face powder
go right over top of everything to
soften the harshness of it all and to
really tone it down and make it wearable
and you're left with still a very very
defined nose o Mamiya a lot right so I
do like that the four gives you so much
precision as to where you want the lines
to go and it makes it super even but
it's also very harsh so now I'm going to
try and soften it using my Beauty
Blender and some powder and just going
over top of the lines there we go that's
working take down the harshness so from
this we learn to use a layer contour
shade use a very soft hand because you
think this technique will cut your nose
okay so after putting the powder on it
definitely looks a lot more soft but
still define and snatch it actually
looks slicker got a nose job done okay
and then now to seal the deal I'm gonna
go into my Julia's masquerade I should
have this palette is life and this color
right here Geza
I'm gonna highlight my nose like I
usually would all the way across this
nose is getting severe up in here
alright so after the highlight I can
actually live with this my nose looks
super super tiny and thin and I kind of
like this technique guy and that ladies
and gentlemen is how the latest
Instagram trend transforms noses into
pinched tiny little creatures so that is
what it looks like that is how my nose
contour looks like using a fork as a
guide and my final verdict I like it I
like it
I do feel like you have to use a very
soft color because anything too dark and
you will end
up looking like Squidward in a pinched
way and I also feel like you have to use
a standing mirror in front of you
because it was very hard for me to place
the fork on my nose
keep this mirror here and then find the
opening to put my brush in so you do
absolutely need a mirror that you can
place in front of you and you can just
like go like that but I couldn't do that
today so that was kind of challenging a
little thing I didn't like about this
technique is that the points with the
actual ends of the fork can leave an
indent in your foundation a little so
you have to be careful of that but other
than that I actually really like this
technique and I might use it a lot more
because it's so easy to find your
precision I like it I feel like such a
hypocrite but I like it what's happening
to me but yeah that is it guys that is
the latest Instagram trend tried out and
tested here on my channel and go ahead
and give it a try and let me know here
